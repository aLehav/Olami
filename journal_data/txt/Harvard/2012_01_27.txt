After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Yale announced that U-Hauls and kegs would be banned at their pre-The Game tailgate from now on, and that all tailgating that happens must be concluded by kickoff. While the changes are understandable, they no doubt leave many Harvard students wondering, “What is the point in going to The Game now?”
Truly, in the past, the festivities have only centered on football in name, never in fact. We believe this is largely because the contest in question is not something that is either school’s strong suit. In order to maintain the vitality of this storied rivalry in the absence of alcohol, we ought to compete in something that both schools really do excel at, something the fans could really get behind—like recruiting.
Students would make their way to New Haven for a weekend in late January, and rather than the team going down with pads and helmets, the competitors would busy themselves with buffing out any scuff marks on their loafers and memorizing the Wall Street Journal on the bus ride down.
The night before would be a busy night for the contenders, as they practice tying double Windsor knots and unbuttoning suit jackets as they chant “Do the basics, best!” and utter feverish prayers to John Pierpont Morgan. Meanwhile the rest of us who are only in town to watch the competition would do our best to catch up with a few Elis before getting to sleep early for the 0700 start.
Now, we know, this doesn’t sound like as much fun as a barely-remembered tailgate followed by some good old-fashioned pigskin slingin’, but the competition hasn’t even begun! On the morning of the competition, the Harvard band would begin to play as the drummer beats his instrument in what would be perfect time for “99 Luftballons” if the entire rest of the band weren’t preparing for the competition.
The cheerleaders would have a part to play in this new competition as well of course. Not ours, of course. They would be competing too. But a couple of ex-cheerleaders who graduated in ’04 would make it and fill in.
The fans would line up across from one another, fiercely rooting on their classmates, chanting the most recent levels of the Dow and S&P at their teams. Only a few short blocks away, in the designated safe “free-speech zone,” Occupiers from each school would protest, struggling between their opposing urges to find a more effective way to protest the competition and their urge to build something geodesic.
As the officiating referee blows his whistle, the two teams would sprint toward a series of representatives from different banks, where they would be judged on their ability to avoid the former Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac execs and pick out the Goldman reps to schmooze.  After the first round the students still in the competition, those skilled enough not to be trapped in conversation with a few former Bear Stearns employees just glad to talk to someone, would make their way to an obstacle course where they would crawl hanging from ropes over pools where the original Lehman Brothers make frantic grasps for their ankles in attempts to pull them under.
Having passed these veritable modern Scyllae, the remaining contenders would rush to their second round interviews, where they would be judged on the neatness of their ties or pantsuits as well as the conditions that their resumes have survived in. Should they pass this final test, they must jog the last half-mile of the course while giving a detailed explanation of how to calculate discounted cash flow.
The official at the end of the course would tally up each school’s successful internships, and the school with the most placements would leave the field victorious.
Best of all, the new competition would take the once-a-year excitement of the football game and expand it. If you didn’t get an internship the first time, you can always come back next weekend for the consulting games!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Censorship is one of the Chinese Communist Party’s most powerful tools.  Throughout the sixty-two years the party has ruled, its hold over the country’s media has been crucial to its attempt to both unite and control the Chinese population.  However, the internet age has created an unprecedented situation in which government censorship is actually catalyzing creativity.
How can a rigorous internet censorship campaign result in increased creativity? Today, China has over four hundred million internet users. These users range from casual bloggers to high-profile writers seeking a broader audience.  No matter what the internet users are publishing, however, they are all acutely aware of what ideas they cannot disseminate. Their intimate recognition of these forbidden words allows them to develop a secondary lexicon to express themselves.
As each user attempts to subtly out-step government censors, they are forced to exercise their creativity, creating codes to communicate their opinions.  Yu Hua, a famous Chinese author, describes this process by saying, “To evade censorship when expressing their opinions on the internet, Chinese people give full rein to the rhetorical functions of language, elevating to a sublime level both innuendo and metaphor, parody and hyperbole, conveying sarcasm and scorn through veiled gibes and wily indirection.” For example, internet users have adopted the word “harmony,” touted by Hu Jin Tao, the President of China, in his signature “harmonious society” campaign.  Mocking the government slogan, internet users write that they have been “harmonized” to alert other readers that censors have blocked their online writing.
Engaging in this high-level word play, internet users exercise their creativity so that their work is understood by their target audience while appearing benign to the ever-wary government censors. Communication on such a large scale outside of full government control is an unprecedented trend in the CCP’s history. In his acceptance speech for the 2010 People’s Literature Award, acclaimed author Murong Xuecun said of the CCP’s traditional control over the media, “In my country, the job of the press and electronic media is to promote the government, not to report the truth. The education system is tasked with instructing the people to be loyal to the government and keeping the people ignorant, not with disseminating knowledge.” Within the context of this system, even a censored internet is a drastic departure from the controlled education and stymied traditional media forums of the past.
As an increasing number of Chinese authors turn away from the heavily scrutinized world of print publishing and begin to expand into the online literary world, their verbal dance around internet censors is only becoming more advanced. Murong has mastered this art. Although he has published critiques of rampant government corruption, he has never encountered issues with censors because he publishes a censored print version and a more free-form online edition for his followers.  Unlike other outspoken Chinese authors who have fled the country and are now publishing to a predominantly Western audience, Murong’s ability to use internet publishing to evade censors allows him to direct his message at his target audience, the Chinese people.
Because the Chinese internet is a literary forum comparatively free of government intimidation, online literature has the potential to be the most effective platform for individual expression in contemporary China.  As long as authors like Murong can continue to work within the system, they can take advantage of the incredible power of the internet to mold and shape Chinese society.  This is not to say that the internet is a completely protected incubator for free thought.  Famed thinkers and bloggers such as Ai Weiwei have faced the consequences of publishing their thoughts too openly online.  Despite this reality, however, there has never been a more powerful forum for political self-expression in China.  As long as writers continue to play the game well, this freedom will not be wholly revoked.
The remaining question is whether the upswell in online literature will eventually translate into action offline. As a generation of idealistic internet writers comment on the flaws of Chinese society online, they do so knowing that the authorities are not as likely to hold them accountable for their words. While it is unclear whether this freedom will spur concrete change, for the time being the internet may be the exact source of mobilization needed in China—a place for citizens to turn their thoughts into collective expression.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Edith M. Stokey ’44 had a good memory. When the Harvard Kennedy School needed to compile a personnel database a few years ago, Stokey, though in her mid-80s, was up for the challenge. She mapped out the names and positions of teachers and staff from memory.
Joseph J. McCarthy, former senior associate dean and director of degree programs at the Kennedy School, hung the work on his office door.
“I kept it not only as a reminder to me of what people should be able to do, but also for my students to see that she held all of this in her head,” McCarthy said.
Stokey, who is often referred to as the “founding mother” of the Kennedy School, died of cancer in her Cambridge home on Jan. 16 at the age of 88.
In 1971, Richard J. Zeckhauser ’62, a professor of political economy at the Kennedy School, asked Stokey to lecture in microeconomics and work as a secretary at the fledgling graduate school of government at Harvard. Stokey had just returned to Harvard to pursue a Ph.D. in economics, but she abandoned that plan to take the dual position as lecturer and secretary.
At the newly founded Kennedy school, “secretary at that time was like being the secretary of state,” McCarthy said.
In 1978, Stokey and Zeckhauser co-wrote a book entitled “A Primer for Policy Analysis” that is still taught in public policy courses around the country.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 remembered that Stokey guided him when he was struggling to gain his footing as a new assistant professor teaching economics.
“She was a remarkable mentor and friend,” Ellwood wrote in a message to the Kennedy School community. “I still use her lessons every day.”
Stokey also paved the way for women at the Kennedy School, according to McCarthy.
Mary Jo Bane said that she was following in Stokey’s footsteps when she became the first woman to “hold the title” of tenured professor and academic dean at the Kennedy School.
“I use the language of ‘hold the title’ quite consciously, because I am not the first woman to do the jobs; Edith is,” Bane said.
Stokey retired from the Kennedy School in 2000.
Stokey is survived by three children—Elizabeth, Roger, and Lucy, who is a member of the Class of 1977. Her husband Roger P. Stokey ’42 died in 1982.
Stokey and her husband often played bridge together, according to her son Roger.
One day during May of 1943, Stokey turned to her future husband, who was on a brief furlough from his Navy duties, and asked: “What about Monday?”.
Mr. Stokey said yes, not knowing “if she was talking about getting married or playing bridge,” Roger said.
“Turned out she was talking about marriage, but he was fine with either one,” he added.
Roger said that he hopes his mother will be remembered for her industrious and warm-hearted nature.
“This is a woman who even in her mid-80s never rested,” Roger said. “She was loved by a lot of people, had an impact on a number of lives.... That’s her legacy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Evan M. O’Dorney ’15 scribbles on a white board in a cramped Canaday single strewn with laundry and empty peanut butter jars. His face lights up as he demonstrates how to identify patterns using colorful, maze-like diagrams that he has constructed.
He smiles quietly and squints his eyes in intense concentration. Lost in thought, he falls silent as he ponders the complex shapes.
“I might be able to get it published in some little magazine,” O’Dorney says offhandedly as he perches on the edge of his unmade bed.
Publishing might be a small feat for O’Dorney, who had won both the Intel Science Competition and the National Spelling Bee before he matriculated at Harvard this past fall.
At Harvard, O’Dorney has taken the math department by storm. He is one of the few freshmen ever to place out of Math 55—the most advanced undergraduate math course offered—directly into graduate mathematics classes in his first semester.
Though something of a celebrity within the freshman class, O’Dorney modestly discusses his achievements with unstudied nonchalance.
O’Dorney has little patience for small talk, but he is ever eager to discuss his two primary passions—music and math.
TOO COOL FOR SCHOOL
When O’Dorney began to do addition at the age of two, his parents quickly recognized his extraordinary intellectual capacity.
“He soaked up things so quickly,” says his mother, Jennifer J. O’Dorney. “The more I taught him the more he wanted to learn.”
By the time O’Dorney was old enough to attend school, his parents decided to homeschool him. “He would have been bored to tears in kindergarten,” his mother said.
O’Dorney’s mother devoted most of her time to her son’s education while he was growing up. His father once worked as a computer programmer but today drives a subway train in San Francisco.
O’Dorney largely taught himself out of textbooks, but his mother worked with him on government and economics.
As O’Dorney reached high school age, his parents began to structure his time with deadlines and assignments.
He attended math classes at the University of California, Berkeley and literature classes with other homeschooled students.
BEATING THE BEE
At age 14, O’Dorney won the 2007 Scripps National Spelling Bee after days of grueling competition.
With the help of his mother, O’Dorney had studied the dictionary for two years before the Bee. He analyzed spelling patterns from French and German and compiled notebooks filled with difficult words. O’Dorney’s highly accurate photographic memory helped him build his tremendous vocabulary.
O’Dorney says he entered the Bee believing that he had a good chance of winning. He remained stoic and calm throughout the famously stressful competition, teaching himself to juggle to drown out distractions from reporters and the audience.
Today, O’Dorney juggles in his free time and seems to be as proud of his Spelling Bee win as he is of his ability to keep four balls in the air—if only for 30 seconds.
But after devoting so much time to mastering orthography, O’Dorney finds rote memorization tiresome and dislikes the garbled logic of the “awkward” English language.
“I was a lot less mature then,” O’Dorney says.
Nevertheless, O’Dorney is proud of his complex and colorful vocabulary, likening proper spelling to the ability to speak foreign languages.
“For Evan, words have very precise definitions,” says Nicholas R. Nardini, O’Dorney’s proctor in Canaday. “It’s always a challenge to match his verbal precision.”
O’Dorney even offered to spell-check this article before it went to print.
NUMBER ONE
Though O’Dorney has demonstrated a phenomenal capacity for memorization, he says his true passion lies in mathematics.
Last year, O’Dorney won the Intel Science competition—a prestigious national contest—for his simple formula to approximate square roots.
A Stanford professor presented a mathematical dilemma to O’Dorney after  attempts to solve the problem with a team of graduate students had failed.
O’Dorney devoted the summer after ninth grade to tackling the problem, and within two weeks, he had found a solution. Two months later, he had ironed out the details to streamline the proof into the cleaner and simpler formula that would eventually win the science competition.
O’Dorney had painstakingly entered data into a computer program during countless trials. He played with numbers to find creative input material that would generate numerical patterns.
“He’s much faster than I am,” says Joseph D. Harris, O’Dorney’s academic advisor.
Last spring, Harris’s colleagues at Stanford and UC Berkeley had told him to look out for “this amazing kid.” Curious, Harris traveled to a math conference where O’Dorney was a participant, and he says he was stunned by O’Dorney’s exceptional ability.
O’Dorney contemplates one day working on number theory—the “most concentrated” form of math, he says. He is uninterested in the potential applications of his work, preferring instead to puzzle over pure math and number theory’s simple equations.
O’Dorney says that he hopes to be a math professor one day.
“He has such a gift for teaching,” his mother says, as she recounts how her son patiently teaches her about the problems he is working on.
FINDING A HOME AT HARVARD
Like all college freshmen, O’Dorney has encountered challenges as he adjusts to college life.
Though he excels in math, he says that he finds written work difficult. He may be an excellent speller, but he struggles to construct essays with structured and focused arguments.
He will take the mandatory Expository Writing 20 this semester, a course he considers an “annoying task.”
O’Dorney joined the Glee Club last semester and spends his free time composing music. Shortly before Christmas, Harvard freshmen witnessed O’Dorney composing a complex musical score on a white board in the back of Annenberg during breakfast. O’Dorney says that he constantly has music in his head that he needs to get down on paper.
He describes the popular music played in Annenberg as “pretty dull.”
Enrolled in two high-level math courses last semester, O’Dorney found that he had little time for socializing with his peers. But his social experience at Harvard, he says, is not important to him.
“He seems blithely untroubled by the same social anxieties that plague the average freshman,” Nardini says.
O’Dorney says he has found a community in the math department. He says that he appreciates the department’s intimate feel and the individual guidance that he receives.
The feeling is mutual. Harris says that admissions recruiters actively seek out talented math students, and that the department is lucky to have O’Dorney as a student.
“He’s content and he’s challenged,” says his mother, adding that O’Dorney has told her that he feels at home among his professors.
“I love Harvard,” O’Dorney says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Claire Danes realized Harvard was home not just to bookworms but also to drag queens on Thursday during the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ 2012 Woman of the Year celebration.
“This is so contrary to what we associate with Harvard,” said Danes, who described the experience as “wackadoodle” and “utterly trippy.”
Danes, a versatile actress who has appeared in films like “Romeo + Juliet” and theater productions like “Pygmalion,” was named the Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year after winning a 2012 Golden Globe Award for her role on the television series “Homeland.” With that award, Danes now has three Golden Globes, an Emmy, and a Screen Actors Guild Award under her belt, in addition to the Pudding Pot that the Hasty Pudding Theatricals bestowed upon her on Thursday in Farkas Hall.
But the Hasty Pudding Theatricals did not simply hand over the Pudding Pot to the actress. Danes, a Yale dropout, had to prove herself worthy of the award by completing a series of tasks—including a recital of a faux-Elizabethan monologue about genitals and a dance-off with a virus.
The two emcees, Hasty Pudding Theatricals president James P. Fitzpatrick ’12 and vice president Ryan P. Halprin ’12, were not shy about bashing Harvard’s Connecticut rival during their roast of Danes. Fitzpatrick said that the two years Danes spent at Yale is “a normal amount of time to spend at a community college.”
The emcees demanded that Danes earn her overdue college degree before receiving the award. The first course she had to pass was English.
One member of the Pudding, dressed as Shakespeare, mentioned Danes’ appearance in the play “Vagina Monologues” before asking her to recite a speech like those in that play. After she repeated his poem, which began with “To be or not to be, an angry lesbian,” he declared her a master of the English language.
He said, “English is not the same as math, as you have seen in Romeo plus Juliet,” referring to the 1996 movie in which she played the Shakespearean heroine alongside Leonardo DiCaprio’s Romeo.
In the consequent classes, including biology and computer science, Danes encountered a cow from “Temple Grandin,” her 2010 HBO TV movie, and a virus carrying a dance fever that challenged Danes to a dance-off—all of which were played by Hasty Pudding Theatricals members.
After Danes passed her classes, Yale’s mascot Handsome Dan, played by Matthew J. DaSilva ’12, presented Danes with her degree. When Halprin questioned whether Danes really deserved the diploma, DaSilva said, “Are you kidding me? We let just about anyone get a degree from Yale.”
Prior to the roast, Danes paraded down Massachusetts Avenue alongside the cross-dressed Fitzpatrick and Halprin in a blue Bentley convertible. Spectators lined up on the street to get a glimpse of the actress as she travelled to Farkas Hall to receive her Pudding Pot.
“You should be studying, all of you,” Danes said to the crowd.
As the car made a turn to Holyoke St., three members of the Porcellian Club tossed a stuffed pig out the window of their clubhouse. During a press conference afterward, Danes said that was her favorite part of the day.
“I actually collect stuffed pigs,” she said.
Despite the jabs about her college experience, Danes said she had a great day.
“This experience will remain forever emblazoned in my mind,” Danes said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is easier to gain early admission to Harvard College than get into a class with Harry Potter on the syllabus.
While Harvard College admitted 18 percent of its early applicants in December, Professor Maria Tatar only admitted 10.5 percent of interested students to her class Folklore and Mythology 90i: “Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature.”
After pre-term planning failed to accurately predict student interest in some courses, many undergraduates found themselves facing competitive lotteries with low acceptance rates in several popular classes.
Although 180 students expressed interest in Folklore and Mythology 90i when they submitted their non-binding course selections in November, about 300 students showed up for the course’s first lecture on Wednesday. Only 32 students were accepted into the course late Wednesday night.
After years of teaching the class in a large lecture format, Tatar is teaching it as a small seminar this semester, in part because only one graduate student applied to be a teaching fellow for the course.
Pre-term planning estimates led professors Douglas A. Melton and Michael J. Sandel to hire nine teaching fellows for their course Government 1093/Life Sciences 60: “Ethics, Biotechnology, and the Future of Human Nature.” They expected about 135 students, Melton said.
When about 600 students showed up at Sever 113, Sandel and Melton moved the first lecture to Sanders Theatre. The professors then tried to permanently move the class to Sanders in order to accommodate all interested students, but their request was not approved, forcing them to whittle the crowd down by lottery to the roughly 300 students who would fit in Emerson 105.
Stephanie H. Kenen, administrative director of the Program in General Education, attributed professors’ inability to accommodate high percentages of interested students in a number of classes to a lack of classroom space and qualified teaching fellows.
“Funding is not a factor. If there are qualified people available to teach, we will pay for them,” Kenen wrote in an email, adding that “it can be challenging to go from a course of 100 to one with 400 students quickly and still preserve the quality of the instruction in the course.”
Pre-term planning also underestimated student interest in U.S. and the World 18: “Thinking about the Constitution,” indicating that 53 students planned to enroll in University Professor Lawrence H. Tribe’s undergraduate course. This week, 157 students entered the online lottery for the course.
But the lottery for Tribe’s class proved less competitive than others, leaving only 6.4 percent of students without a spot when the lottery closed early Thursday afternoon.
Gen Ed courses are lotteried by the Program for General Education using a randomized process. Although Kenen said that the program “strongly encourages faculty to lottery randomly, regardless of class year, previous lottery status, etc.,” many professors said they took other factors into consideration.
In choosing students from the lottery for Folklore and Mythology 90i, Tatar and her teaching fellow selected students who had been kept out of previous incarnations of the course by a lottery in past years and gave priority to several Folklore and Mythology concentrators who needed the course to fulfill a requirement.
In narrowing down the pool for their bioethics class, Melton and Sandel gave preference to juniors and seniors and to those who had already taken Sandel’s popular course Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice.”
Preceptor in Expository Writing Elise R. Morrison gave half of the spots for Expository Writing 40: “Public Speaking Practicum,” to seniors and then divided the remaining 15 spots among freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, aiming for a “gender balance and for fairly even representation across the disciplines (humanities, social sciences, sciences).”
Morrison accepted 30 students, only 18.8 percent of the 160 students who submitted applications for her class.
Several professors expressed regret that resources limited the slots in their highly coveted classes.
“It is incredibly painful to be able to accept less than one-fifth of applicants,” Morrison wrote in an email.
Tatar agreed, “No one wants to cap enrollment or run a lottery.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 30 volunteers—equipped with blankets, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and scarves—fanned out through Cambridge and Somerville at 2 a.m. Thursday morning to carry out the annual Cambridge Homeless Census, a count that Congress mandates that local homeless service organizations conduct in order to receive funding.
Although the official numbers have not been released yet, officials involved in the count speculated that this year’s number will be larger than in years past.
Last year, the census found that 471 homeless people were sleeping on local streets or in shelters. The 2011 number marked 15 and 26 percent decreases from the 2010 and 2009 counts respectively.
Janae E. Alvarez, a first-year masters student at the Divinity School, spearheaded an effort to get students from Harvard involved in the count. She contacted several volunteers at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter.
“It helps keep ties to the homeless. For [the students] take part with the homeless shelter, this is the way it’s going to get funded,” Alvarez said.
The volunteers—which included a Cambridge city councillor, a former police officer, and the head of a local dance studio—formed six groups that, between 2 and 5 a.m., drove and walked through areas that are known to be popular haunts of the homeless in Cambridge and Somerville. The groups were led by members of Cambridge and Somerville Program for Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation (CASPAR), a local nonprofit.
Bianca M. Nfonoyim ’15, who volunteered at the census for the first time, said the count revealed a different side of Cambridge that she had not seen before.
“I recognized a lot of the area by the river, and we saw a homeless person there,” said Nfonoyim, adding that she sometimes runs in that area. “In the daytime, you don’t see any of this going on.”
City Councillor Minka vanBeuzekom participated in the census for the second time.
“I saw somebody in a car sleeping, someone in a wheelchair, and another person who was using a walker,” vanBeuzekom said. “It was pretty disturbing to think that we force people to live that hard of a life.”
These counts are not unique to Cambridge. Every area that receives funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development is required to perform a similar homeless census annually during the last week of January.
Emergency Medical Technician Bob Paige, who checked in with teams via radio throughout the night, has helped conduct the census for ten years. Paige said that volunteer numbers have risen dramatically in the past decade.
“The amount of volunteering, in this day and age, it’s shocking,” Paige said. “We’ve come a long way in participation.”
Beth Auterio, an outreach counselor at CASPAR, said that the census is a necessary but sad event.
“I’m happy to say we found 15 people, but I’m not happy to say it. We got numbers for funding, but 15 people spent the night outside last night in the snow and rain,” Auterio said.
Auterio said that team spirit  made it easier to get through the night.
“We had a good chemistry of talking. When you’re doing it during the day, that’s the one thing that keeps you going,” Auterio said.

Students’ learning does not correlate with the education level or experience of their teachers, Graduate School of Education professor Thomas J. Kane said Thursday in a panel discussion at the School of Education. Nevertheless,  current systems of teacher evaluation focus almost exclusively on those two factors, according to Kane.
Instead, Kane recommended a system which would utilize students’ evaluations of teachers, students’ standardized test scores, and professional evaluations of videotaped lessons as alternative ways to judge and reward teachers.
Kane published a study earlier this month that found student evaluations of teachers were the most consistent measure of teacher effectiveness.
Another important measure is the value-added statistic, a metric that compares students’ standardized test scores before and after one year in the teacher’s classroom.
The study found that an average student with a teacher in the 25th percentile ends the year almost a full school year behind a peer with a teacher in the 75th percentile.
“The [study] is one of the most important education studies that’s ever been conducted,” said School of Education Dean Kathleen McCartney, who offered the introductory remarks.
However, Kane said his recommended methods have been met with criticism.
“The question we should be asking is, ‘Is the predictive power of this better than the information we’re acting on now?’” he said. “Don’t make perfect the enemy of good.”
Mitchell D. Chester, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education, joined Kane on the panel at the School of Education on Thursday.
Chester said he has incorporated elements of Kane’s study in a new teacher evaluation system.
He said that in 25 districts across the state, including in under-performing schools of Massachusetts’ biggest cities, schools have begun implementing the new system.
Speaking about the New England Patriots quarterback, Kane said, “Tom Brady is going to spend four to six hours every day between now and a week from Sunday watching himself on video tape and thinking about each decision that he made.”
He continued, “We don’t do any of that with teachers. It’s crazy.”

In Occupy Harvard’s latest attempt to maintain visibility on campus, approximately 40 students, University employees, and locals accelerated the movement’s next phase, known as Occupy 2.0, with a march around Harvard Yard on Wednesday.
“It’s a reinvention of Occupy, moving onto the next stage where we try to get more people to think about the issues,” said Jennifer A. Sheehy-Skeffington, a graduate student and Occupy Harvard proponent.
Earlier this month, University administrators removed the last remnants of the movement’s once bustling camp. Protesters had descended upon the Yard and assembled a tent city in front of the John Harvard statue in November, a move that caused University administrators to restrict and monitor access to the Yard, to the chagrin of many students and visitors.
Sheehy-Skeffington explained that the protesters plan to organize more events such as Wednesday’s in an effort to gain broader support from the Harvard and Cambridge communities. Occupy 2.0 also hopes to organize events such as teach-ins in the near future.
The Bread and Puppet Theater, a political puppet troupe, joined Occupy Harvard’s march and presented a three-part show on the national Occupy movement’s history.
“It was a spectacular event, which basically brought a smile to the face of everyone and brought in a lot of people,” said Giuliana Chamedes, a Harvard teaching assistant in history and literature. “It was part of the goals of 2.0, an event to illustrate the goals of Occupy movements around the world in a fun and informative way.”
According to movement members, Occupy Harvard, now stripped of its physical manifestation, will push for greater transparency from the Harvard administration and seek to make connections with the broader community.
“2.0 is about moving beyond the occupation and focusing on action,” Occupy supporter and Student Labor Action Movement member Gabriel H. Bayard ’15 said. “It’s about being more flexible yet still maintaining a presence on campus.”
Chamedes said, “Even though the encampment has been dismantled, Occupy Harvard is here to stay.”
According to Chamedes, Occupy 2.0 is particularly concerned with the layoffs some University Library workers face. After the march, Occupy protestors joined a library workers’ rally in a show of solidarity. Last Thursday, Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton said that the library system will decrease its workforce as part of its ongoing reorganization, an announcement that led to the protest on Wednesday.
“While it’s not an Occupy Harvard campaign, No Layoffs is really a coalition campaign to protect Harvard library workers,” Bayard said.
Occupy Harvard members said that they will continue to collaborate with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and student groups such as SLAM to petition against library cuts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED Jan. 28 at 4:05 p.m.
Yale quarterback Patrick Witt, who attracted national attention when he faced a decision between playing in the Nov. 19 Harvard-Yale football game and attending an interview for a Rhodes Scholarship, reportedly did not have a choice at all.
According to the New York Times, Witt’s candidacy for the prestigious scholarship was suspended prior to the interview date due to allegations of sexual assault against the student. The Rhodes Trust received word “through unofficial channels” that an anonymous female at Yale had accused the quarterback of sexual assault without filing a formal complaint, the Times reported.
According to the Times, the foundation asked Yale President Richard C. Levin and other officials whether Witt still had their endorsement. Before Yale made a formal decision, Witt announced his intention to play in The Game and withdraw his application for the scholarship, the Times reported.
Witt could not be reached for comment. His agent, Mark F. Magazu, II, said that Witt’s Rhodes application was never put on hold. “We can definitively show that the candidacy was valid and bona fide until the very end when he withdrew,” Magazu said.
In a statement released Friday on behalf of Witt, Magazu confirmed a timeline of events similar to that reported by the Times but said that the conflict with the football game, not the assault complaint, caused Witt to withdraw his application for the Rhodes.
 In the release, he said, “As the decision process unfolded, Patrick became aware that an anonymous source had contacted the Rhodes Trust with false information purporting to reference an informal—and confidential—complaint within the University. In light of this, and given the short period of time between this occurrence and the potential final interview, the Rhodes Trust asked for an additional letter of reference for Patrick from Yale. By that time, however, Patrick had already informed the Athletic Department officials that he intended to withdraw his candidacy due to the inability to reschedule his final interview.”
Many questions remain about what happened in the week before the Bulldogs took the field—with Witt as a starter—and were dominated by Harvard, 45-7. It is unclear how much Witt, Yale officials, or the Rhodes Trust knew about the assault allegations at any point.
According to the Times, Witt has already finished his coursework. Though he is working on his senior essay, he is not enrolled at Yale and is instead preparing in California for the upcoming NFL draft.
Witt is still listed on the Yale College Online Facebook, according to the Yale Daily News.
A three-year starter for the Bulldogs, Witt transferred to Yale from the University of Nebraska after the 2008 season—in part because he wanted to escape the attention that came with being a football player on a Big 12 campus, The Boston Globe wrote at the time.
But Witt found himself in the spotlight again when he revealed that his final interview for the Rhodes Scholarship coincided with the 2011 iteration of The Game. After Witt announced his intention to compete against Harvard rather than for the scholarship, national media outlets championed him as the consummate team player.
Witt, who is attempting to find a spot in the NFL, now faces a different kind of scrutiny.
Before the allegations, character was often cited by commentators as one of Witt’s strengths, according to Eric Galko, director of scouting for a website which discusses prospective NFL draft picks. Galko said that Witt was ranked the 23rd best quarterback in this year’s class. Other websites have him ranked as highly as 17th.
The recent news, Galko said to The Crimson, could be a “huge detriment” to his draft potential.
“NFL teams have whole security teams to look into stuff like this,” Galko said.

Academy Award Winning Actor Cuba Gooding Jr. and Star Wars producer Rick McCallum discussed the motivations and difficulties in executing their recently released movie “Red Tails” at the Institute of Politics Friday.
The movie is based on the true story of the Tuskeegee airmen, a group of African-American fighter pilots who changed the course of WWII. Gooding and McCallum said they were motivated to do the film because they felt it was important to bring attention to the story of the Tuskeegee airmen, because of their role in the war effort and the racial discrimination they faced.
“In America, 90 percent of kids under 20 have no idea of who the Tuskeegee airmen were. I remember the first time I read that script—supposedly having finished my education—and not knowing anything about the Tuskeegee airmen,” Gooding said. “A lot of kids who don’t get wonderful educations get their educations through cinema. It’s about time to celebrate the contribution that we as African Americans have made to America.”
While Red Tails opened at the box office at number two, McCallum said that it was difficult for him and executive producer George Lucas to secure funding for the film, primarily because there were no white actors in leading roles.
“It has to do with the fact that [the major studios] don’t inherently believe that you can have a film with an all-black cast,” he said. “They just don’t know how to market it.”
Gooding and McCallum emphasized the potential for this film to open up the market for other serious, African-American films.
“If this film does well, other writers and directors will be able to bring their stories to the screen,” Gooding said.
McCallum joked that if the film had a Twilight-esque opening weekend, “we’ll never see another white person in a movie again.”
But Gooding also added that he felt the film’s message goes beyond racial struggle. “Everyone keeps saying ‘black airmen,’ but it’s also a film about airmen. It’s about being American.”
Real-life Tuskeegee airman and Yale Law School graduate Colonel Enoch “Woody” Woodhouse also attended the event. At the end of the talk, Woodhouse presented Gooding with a red tie similar to those worn by the Tuskeegee airmen, noting that the tie was “red, not crimson.”
Alexis J. Smith ’15, who attended the event, said that she found the panel “inspirational.”
“The clips they showed of the movie were very empowering,” she said.
Jeffrey G. Edwards ’15 was impressed with the level of dedication from the people involved in making the movie.
“It’s great to see how much they cared about such an important story,” he said.
The panel was moderated by Director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute and Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and was co-sponsored by the Black Policy Conference, the Black Student’s Association and the Black Men’s Forum.

The Experiment Fund, a new seed-stage investment fund, officially launched Friday with the hopes of providing budding entrepreneurs with support and capital to build their startups.
During the event, which took place in a packed Maxwell Dworkin lecture hall, the founders introduced the fund and explained the importance of having a strong entrepreneurial spirit on campus and the need for a more extensive support network to help students succeed.
Co-founder Patrick S. Chung ’96 said that the Experiment Fund will fill a void that has existed for many years at Harvard with “support, capital, and expertise that have not existed on this campus ever before.”
W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, also a co-founder of the fund, elaborated on the idea, saying that “the fund wants to be helpful” and support groups like HSA and HackHarvard.
In an email, Van Vuuren clarified the difference between the Experiment Fund and other sources of funding entrepreneurs may seek.
“We are not an incubator or a grant giving organization,” he wrote. “We ultimately invest and help them grow with seed capital, consistent guidance, and unparalleled access to experts.”
Harry Weller, the third co-founder of the fund and a general partner at the large global venture capital firm NEA, said that the purpose of the fund was to “take the very best company builders and expose them to the best innovators.”
But the launch was not only about those providing funding. Nicholas B. Krasney ’09 and Ho A. Tuan ’09, the creators of Tivli, also took the stage to demonstrate how funding and advising could help a small product develop and grow. Tivli, a real-time television service for the web, received funding from NEA and with it became a popular staple among Harvard students. It paved the way for the development of projects like the Experiment Fund.
When asked about what kind of projects the Experiment Fund would like to support, Tuan said that it is “interested in things that will fundamentally change industries.” He described individuals involved in such projects as “being crazy in a lot of ways.”
Yet Krasney also suggested that present-day entrepreneurs are not perceived by peers to be as unconventional as their predecessors.
“A few years ago, starting a company wasn’t as acceptable as it is today,” he said.
Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Cherry A. Murray, who introduced the speakers, noted a possible benefit of the increased Cambridge-based support and funding. Referring to famous Harvard dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark E. Zuckerberg, she said that the Experiment Fund will allow students to pursue their business ventures and still “get a Harvard degree.”
According to Murray, the Experiment Fund and the venture capital firms associated with it would also benefit from being involved in the next big website, idea, or startup.
“It’s a win-win,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After his triple-double in his first game with the D-League Erie Bayhawks, Jeremy Lin '10 was once again recalled to the injury-plagued New York Knicks. 
And unlike previous poor performances in a Knicks jersey, this time Lin made a stronger case for staying up in the NBA. 
Although it came in the last six minutes of a Jan. 24 New York blowout of the Charlotte Bobcats, Lin registered eight points, doled out four assists, and grabbed two rebounds. He also blocked a shot by Charlotte center Bismack Biyombo, who has a five-inch height advantage on the Harvard grad.
Despite the strong numbers, Lin still struggled with fouls and turnovers, aspects of his game he will need to improve for Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni to give him more playing time. The point guard had three fouls and a turnover in his six minutes of play.
But D’Antoni might have no choice in sending Lin back down to the Bayhawks this week, as the former Leverett House resident has been complaining of a swollen ankle.  D’Antoni has previously stated that he knows Lin doesn’t factor strongly into the Knicks game plan currently but likes giving players like Lin time down in the D-League.
As for now, we at The Back Page just hope Lin’s ankle heals up so he can break other ankles.

2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After we crowned Andrew Campbell as the top male athlete of 2011, we now turn our attention to the women’s side. First up, golf’s Bonnie Hu v. lacrosse’s Jennifer VanderMeulen and field hockey’s Cynthia Tassopoulos v. two-sport athlete Mel Baskind.
Check back soon to find out the winners on the women's side of the bracket.
Bonnie Hu v. Jennifer VanderMeulen
 
In 2011, VanderMeulen and Hu established themselves as some of the best of all-time in their respective sports. On the green, Hu averaged a 75.55—the lowest score in Harvard history—and earned a spot at the NCAA regionals, where she finished 41st. VanderMeulen picked up where she left off after a dominant rookie campaign in 2010, leading the Ivy League in scoring and earning a spot on the All-Ivy First Team for the second straight year.
But while Hu, a Crimson business board member, impressed early on in her rookie campaign, she underperformed toward the end of the season, missing the top-11 and All-Ivy honors at the Ancient Eight championships despite helping the Crimson to a second-place finish. VanderMeulen has scored in every game of her college career so far and helped Harvard to its best conference finish in 17 years.
WINNER: Jennifer VanderMeulen 
Cynthia Tassopoulos v. Mel Baskind
Both Tassopoulos and Baskind propelled their respective teams to new heights this year. The women’s field hockey team recorded five more wins in 2011 than 2010, and a lot of that can be attributed to Tassopoulos' play in goal. And while other Ivy League goalkeepers with less impressive resumes picked up higher league honors, Tassopoulos arguably ranked as the best in the Ancient Eight. 
But while Tassopoulos had a career year in her sport, Baskind can look back at 2011 for two stellar campaigns, as she picked up individual and team honors between her two sports. Many top athletes would have difficulty improving on a soccer season that ended with an All-Ivy selection and a near Ivy League title.  But after her stellar junior lacrosse season, the two-sport captain did just that, taking the women’s soccer team all the way to the summit, winning the Ancient Eight crown outright and earning a unanimous Ivy League Player of the Year selection in the process.
Without Tassopoulos, one team might have fared much worse.  Without Baskind, two teams would have been without their fearless leader.  In the end, that gives Baskind the edge.
WINNER: Mel Baskind

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard women’s basketball team already played its first Ivy League game of the year against Dartmouth on Jan. 14, this weekend marks the official opening weekend of Ancient Eight play. For the Crimson (8-7, 1-0 Ivy), who face Yale (9-7, 1-1) on Friday and Brown on Sunday (10-6, 1-1), it couldn’t come any faster.
“We’ve been anticipating this basically all year since we got here in September, so our excitement levels are definitely up,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “There’s been a lot of waiting time, so we all just want to get it going.”
Especially for this year’s Harvard lineup, ranked second in the league thus far, every game is critical if the squad wants to stay within striking distance of Princeton, a team already 3-0 in Ivy play.
After coming off of a sluggish start against North Dakota on Jan. 17 and a near comeback that resulted in a 60-57 win for the Fighting Sioux, the Crimson is ready to tackle the Ivy season with more energy than ever before.
“Our consistency is something we’ve lacked a little bit throughout the entire year, and it comes from consistency on defense, especially,” Berry said. “Just keeping the intensity high for all 40 minutes, whether it’s getting all the loose balls or going up to the rebounds, we need to stay consistent and keep that energy high.”
Unlike Dartmouth, who came into its matchup with Harvard riding a 10-game losing streak, Yale arrives at Lavietes Pavilion on the heels of a tough double-header versus Brown last weekend. In the first contest, the Bulldogs soundly beat the Bears, 75-65, before losing later in the day, 60-55.
Ranked second and third, respectively, in this year’s Ivy League preseason poll, Harvard and Yale promise to showcase an athletically and emotionally tough game. The Crimson brings to the court a desire for payback after losing both games to Yale last year, 73-70 and 78-65. It was the second time since 1985 and the first time since 1993 that the Bulldogs had swept the Crimson.
“You always have this innate rivalry between Yale, whether on campus or through the basketball programs, but personally losing to them twice last year was a huge disappointment,” Berry said. “Getting back at them this year is another chance for us to not only take down one of our biggest rivals but also take down a team we don’t have the best history with.”
But Harvard’s retribution will first have to face Yale freshman guard Sarah Halejian, an underestimated offensive threat who has held the Ivy League Rookie of the Week title for the past three weeks with 8.9 points per game.
Brown, too, has an Ivy League Player of the Week who the Crimson will have to handle: sophomore guard Lauren Clarke, who in the past two games has made six-of-nine three-pointers and every free throw attempt.
“Brown has been playing tremendously this year, and I think they’re going to pose a challenge for us,” Berry said. “I think they’re going to come out tough. If we beat them [and Yale] it’d be a great first weekend of Ivies.”
To challenge both squads, Harvard will turn to its top three players this season—Berry, junior forward Victoria Lippert, and sophomore guard Christine Clark—as well as the depth of its bench that includes newly healed sophomores Missy Mullins and Elise Gordon.
Berry, who has recorded 12.7 points per game, is on target to push past Crimson legend Emily Tay on Harvard’s career scoring list. With 1,262 points so far, Berry needs one more to move up to 9th overall.
“It’s unreal because when I was a freshman, [Tay] was the golden child,” Berry said. “She could do everything and anything, score any way, so it’s unreal. Looking through the list of great alumni, that I’m even considered an equal…maybe after my career I’ll look back and say ‘Wow, you did some cool things,’ but as of right now I just try to keep that as far as possible and focus on our team goal.”
This weekend’s team goal focuses on defense, rebounding, and continuing the Crimson’s streak of victory at home, having won seven of the past eight Ivy contests at Lavietes.
“We’re working a lot more on team communication and playing as a team, having team defense,” Clark said. “The whole team concept we’ve really tried to strengthen.”
“That’s how you win in the Ivy League—everyone is so tough,” Berry added. “We can score points. That’s never a problem for us. But if we can really buckle down on defense and rebounding, consistent for 40 minutes, I think that’s what will get us over the edge and get us a championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last two times the No. 23 Harvard men’s basketball team has stepped foot in Payne Whitney Gymnasium in New Haven, the result has been, well, pain. A lot of it.
First, there was the heartbreaking 70-69 loss to Yale last Feb. 26, when junior guard Brandyn Curry’s last-second layup attempt rattled around the rim and out.
But that was nothing compared to the scene two weeks later, when the Crimson met Princeton in the Ivy League playoff on the Bulldogs’ neutral home court. Again, the game came down to the buzzer, and you know what happens next.
If Harvard had won either of those two contests, it would have gone dancing for the first time since the Truman presidency. Instead, here we are 66 years later, with the Crimson still striving for that elusive taste of March Madness.
But now, Harvard is in a better position than ever before to achieve that goal. The Crimson’s historic—by its standards—14-2 run through its non-conference schedule, highlighted by a championship in the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament over Thanksgiving, placed it in the Top 25 for the first time in program history on Dec. 5.
Harvard has remained ranked in six of the seven weeks since, receiving a barrage of national media attention while positioning itself for an at-large bid if it is unable to win the Ancient Eight.
But the Crimson wants nothing to do with that safety blanket. Instead, after splitting with the Tigers last season, Harvard is determined to win its first outright Ivy title in program history.
And while the Crimson is certainly it the favorite to do so, its road to the top will not be easy. The Ivy League’s 14-game regular season schedule is like nothing else seen in all of college basketball. Because the Ancient Eight does not have a postseason tournament—the only Division I conference not to do so—it is the league’s regular season champion who gets the NCAA automatic bid, making every game that much more important.
As Harvard learned last season, there’s no room for error. Every basket can be the difference between the chance to nearly upset a future Final Four team on national TV—as Princeton received—and getting left out of the party despite a Top-35 RPI, instead being miserably underseeded and sent to the middle of Oklahoma for the NIT—as befell the Crimson.
HARVARD (16-2, 2-0 Ivy) at YALE (12-4, 2-0)
The men’s hockey game between these two schools will be the one nationally televised tonight, but it's the basketball contest that holds far more meaning. In fact, it’s probably the biggest game remaining on the Ivy League schedule.
The Bulldogs are the only team with a legitimate shot of challenging Harvard for the 2011-2012 Ivy crown. Other than a bad loss at Quinnipiac, Yale’s only defeats this season have come from the hands of BCS-conference teams (Seton Hall, Wake Forest, and Florida). Junior guard Austin Morgan has given Harvard enormous trouble in the past, and the Bulldogs possess the type of size the Crimson can at times struggle with, highlighted by senior center Greg Mangano.
It’s understood that Yalies are accustomed to making bold proclamations (“Iraq has nuclear weapons” comes to mind), but Mangano, a 6’10 center who can shoot the three, surprised everyone when he declared for the NBA draft after his junior season. He eventually came to his senses, returning to school after a stint playing for Team U.S.A. at the World University Games in China. And this year, Mangano has indeed proven himself to have NBA-level talent, leading the conference with 19.4 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game.
The contest’s key matchup will be between Mangano and Crimson co-captain Keith Wright, whom Mangano ripped on Twitter after Wright was named last season’s Ivy League Player of the Year. Mangano thus will certainly have a chip on his shoulder tonight, while Wright—whose numbers have dipped in the Crimson’s slow-paced, team-oriented offense this season—will be out to back up his award.
This game will almost definitely be close, and what should be a rowdy Yale student section—much like many others Harvard has encountered in opposing gyms this season—will be hungry to see the Bulldogs upset a Top 25 team and its biggest rival.
But this is a more experienced Crimson squad than last year’s, one that has proven it knows how to win tight road games and one that fully understands the importance of emerging from New Haven with a victory after its heartbreak there last season.
It certainly won’t be easy, but just like the U.S. News and World Report rankings and most everything else, I’m taking the Crimson to come out slightly ahead.
Pick: Harvard 68, Yale 65
DARTMOUTH (4-14, 0-2) AT BROWN (6-13, 0-2)
Perhaps Brown should hire Billy Bob Thornton, because this season, it’s been all bad news for the Bears. First, top recruit Rafael Maia was deemed ineligible by the NCAA in November. Soon thereafter, forward Tucker Halpern was lost for the season thanks to a bad case of mononucleosis, a crippling blow to a team that should have been on the rise this year.
Dartmouth, meanwhile, gave the Crimson a run for its money in the squads’ two games this season—even leading by seven in the second half of the teams’ Jan. 7 contest at Lavietes Pavilion—but eventually reminded everyone why the Big Green will be the league’s bottom dweller once again.
This game should generate as little interest as Rob Schneider’s new CBS sitcom, so let’s move on.
Pick: Brown 64, Dartmouth 57
HARVARD AT BROWN
The Bears, to their credit, gave the Crimson as much trouble as anyone last year. Brown held a 22-point halftime lead on Feb. 12 at Lavietes Pavilion before being outscored 54-25 in the second half of Harvard’s win, a major turning point in the Crimson’s season. Two weeks later, the Bears led by 11 at the break in Providence before again being dominated, 44-27, in the second.
Sophomore guard Sean McGonagill, the reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year, can be an elite scorer—as evidenced by his 39-point outing against Columbia last season—while Toledo transfer Stephen Albrecht and former Macaulay Culkin doppelganger Andrew McCarthy average double digits as well. But the Crimson has too many weapons of its own for the Bears to compete.
Pick: Harvard 73, Brown 60
COLUMBIA (12-7, 1-1) AT CORNELL (6-11, 1-2)
Much like Brown, both these teams were brutally hit by the injury bug early in their seasons, when Columbia guard Noruwa Agho—the conference’s leading scorer last year—and talented Cornell forward Errick Peck were both lost to season-ending knee injuries.
The result was two teams with little chance of competing for anything in the 2011-2012 season. In Ithaca, Big Red senior guard Chris Wroblewski was left to tearfully sit around and read the Cornell Basketball Blog, recalling the good 'ol days when he was achieving greatness with Ryan, Jeff, and Lou. Things have been better in N.Y.C., where the Lions finished with a winning record in non-conference play thanks in large part to the play of junior guard Brian Barbour.
Freshman Shonn Miller has provided hope for Cornell’s future and is the clear frontrunner for the league’s Rookie of the Year in 2012, but success is still a long way away for both these teams.
Pick: Cornell 67, Columbia 62
DARTMOUTH AT YALE
I’m on a word count and running out of room, so let’s just sum this up by saying that to think this game will be close would be about as inaccurate as a Tom Williams resume.
Pick: Yale 74, Dartmouth 58
PRINCETON (10-8, 1-1) at PENN (10-9, 2-0)
Following two great seasons, the Tigers have suffered an expected return to the middle of the Ivy pack after the departures of Sydney Johnson, Dan Mavraides, and Kareem Maddox. Penn, meanwhile, once again looks poised to not live up to its talent level, losing multiple winnable games early on.
Ian Hummer has blossomed into an elite big man for Princeton, averaging 17.3 points and 7.8 rebounds per game. In Philly, Zack Rosen is giving Mangano a great race for Player of the Year—hopefully Greg’s not too mean if Rosen wins—averaging 18.3 points and becoming the Quakers all-time assists leader in the process.
Rosen and fellow senior Tyler Bernardini will be leaving everything on the court in a last-chance effort to reach the Big Dance this season, but for now, this game looks like a battle for third place.
Pick: Penn 73, Princeton 66

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s something to be said about a conference of well-matched opponents. After all, it makes competition that much more exciting for the players and nail-biting for the fans.
But with five draws in its last seven ECAC contests, Harvard men’s hockey is looking to break free from the pack with outright wins in a pair of conference matchups this weekend.
The Crimson (4-6-8, 3-4-6) will take on Yale (8-9-2, 5-6-1) Friday evening at Bright Hockey Center and then follow up with another home match against Brown (8-8-3, 5-5-2) on Saturday.
All three teams are members of the ECAC, a conference in which third through 10th place are currently separated by only three points. With the Bulldogs and the Bears both travelling to face Dartmouth as well, this weekend is guaranteed to be critical in shaking up conference standings.
To add to the excitement, Harvard’s Friday night game against Yale is being televised on NBC Sports Network.
“I think it will be a cool experience to play on TV because it’s something that most people haven’t done before,” freshman goaltender Steve Michalek said. “But it won’t affect the way we play.”
Although struggling just below the .500 mark in conference play, Harvard is coming off a weekend that included two overtime ties against nationally-ranked opponents.
The Crimson saw its one-goal lead slip away versus then-No. 18 Colgate last Friday, resulting in a 2-2 draw, but then came back from a 2-1 deficit of its own to tie No. 9 Cornell the following evening.
Junior forward Marshall Everson stepped up in the matches, netting a power-play score and assisting on senior Alex Killorn’s game-tying goal against the Big Red.
Both Everson and Killorn, the team’s point leader, along with other Harvard offensive contributors, including juniors Danny Biega and Alex Fallstrom, will need to take advantage of scoring opportunities against Yale’s junior goaltender Jeff Malcolm, who boasts a .913 save percentage and has manned the net in all eight of the team’s wins this season.
But although the Bulldogs also possess the country’s sixth-best penalty kill at 87.5 percent, the Crimson owns the country’s No. 1 power play at 33 percent. In fact, Harvard has scored 30 of its 54 goals in man-up situations, failing to record a power-play score in only one matchup this season.
Meanwhile, Brown has been able to convert on barely 15 percent of its man-up opportunities. Despite those scoring struggles, the Bears are tied with the Crimson for sixth place in the ECAC thanks to earlier wins over Cornell and Union.
This weekend’s matchup between Brown and Harvard will be the 159th meeting in a series that dates back to 1898, making it the oldest rivalry in collegiate hockey.
This year the teams are battling to break out of the stagnant ECAC standings, and although one would think that being at Bright Hockey Center may give an edge to the Crimson, the road team has won each of the last eight games between the two squads.
Harvard’s defense will have to contend with the Bears’ points leader, captain Jack Maclellan. The senior forward is responsible for nearly a fifth of the team’s goals and was recently named a Hobey Baker Award candidate for the second time.
Fortunately for the Crimson, Michalek has posted impressive performances, and he has proven himself as an anchor for the Harvard defense despite being new to collegiate play.
This weekend will be a test for the Crimson to see if they can put together the rookie’s skills in net and the veterans’ play up front to come out with the team’s first win in nearly seven weeks.
“I think we’re all pretty optimistic about this weekend.” Michalek said. “We played a couple of games against good teams last weekend, and we’re looking to carry that momentum into this one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dominating Ancient Eight football in 2011, senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz continues to receive national attention, as the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year was recently selected to participate in the Players All-Star Classic on Feb. 4 in Little Rock, Ark. Add it to the list of accolades for the Harvard MVP and member of six national All-America teams.
The postseason game will serve as a means of exposure for NFL draft prospects. According to the All-Star Classic website, over 60 players who participated in a similar contest last season went on to careers in the NFL.
Ortiz capped off his Crimson career in style. Highlighted by two sacks and 3.5 tackles for loss in an Ivy League title-clinching performance against Penn, he registered 10 of the Crimson’s 28 sacks and 15 tackles for losses over the course of his senior campaign.
Ortiz is the Ivy League’s lone representative in the 4 p.m. EST game. He is one of 11 defensive tackles.
The game will be televised on Comcast/Charter Sport Southeast (CSS) and Cox Sports Television (CST).

Remember the good old days when you asked people to school dances, like prom and homecoming? Well, the time has come again (for freshmen at least). With only a week left, pull out all the stops and "go big or go home" with these ten foolproof ways to get that guy or girl you've been eyeing.
1. The Treasure Hunt: Send him on a quest for a particular book in the Widener stacks. Place a note inside the book that says, "Mind if I check you out? Come to formal with me!"
 2. "Music is the Soundtrack of Our Lives": Add some music to your date-to-be's life by serenading her. Sing "A Whole New World" from Aladdin so that on Feb. 3 you can be "freewheeling through an endless diamond sky" at the Night Under the Stars-themed Freshman Formal.
3. For a More Academic Approach: Find out a class she is in and talk to the professor before class. Ask to add a slide to the end of the lecture presentation that asks your date to formal (It could work if the professor thinks that "young love" is cute, but beware: if it doesn't work, you'll never be able to take that class).
4. Facebook Official: If you like public proposals, why not try Facebook? Post a poem that waxes eloquent about your desired date on the Harvard Class of 2015 wall.
5. Get Creative: Decorate your date's door with blue paper and stars and wait for him to come back from class. Then, let the special guy know that you wished upon a star to take him to formal.
6. Keepin' It Classy on the Ice: Take your desired date to Harvard Skate and while you're having fun skating, have the worker at the ice-rink ask her out on your behalf over the loudspeakers.
7. Procrastinators' Delight: Use the various foods in Annenberg to your advantage. Spell out "formal?" on a plate with beans or Sriracha Chili Sauce and surprise him during dinner. How appetizing.
8. Be a YouTube Star: Record your very own song, like "Take a chance/it's time to dance…" Then post the video on YouTube and send the link to her friends!
9. The 99% Approach: Set up a tarp in the yard with a sign that says, "Occupy my heart. Freshman Formal?"
10. For the Lazy People Out There: A simple text might suffice. "Feb. 3… You. Me. Dancing? =D".

Claire Danes has come and gone, but there's still time to get the rundown on Jason Segel. Here's all you need to know about the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' 2012 Man of the Year:
1. He's a freak. Segel's first notable role was that of stoner Nick Andopolis in Judd Apatow's 1999 TV series "Freaks and Geeks."
2. You can call him Marshall. Fans may know him best as the lovable Marshall Eriksen on "How I Met Your Mother."
3. He's a hot commodity in Hollywood. Having already starred in films like "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and "The Muppets," Segel will be appearing in "The Five-Year Engagement" and Judd Apatow's "This is 40" in 2012.
 
4. He's musically inclined. Check out "Dracula's Lament," "You Just Got Slapped," and "Wonky-Eyed Girl."
5. He has a room full of puppets. A lover of the Muppets, Segel recently told New York Magazine, "My house is packed with puppets. Like, everywhere…I have one room that's sort of dedicated to puppets." Which is why…
6. He can't get a date. "It's why I'm still single."
7. He's not afraid to let it all hang out. In "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Segel goes full frontal in a scene in which his character is dumped. (Segel later stated that the scene was based on his own "Naked Breakup.")
8. He recently hosted SNL. Check out the episode here.
9. He's coming to Cambridge. Segel will be accepting his Pudding Pot award on Friday, Feb. 3, in Farkas Hall.
