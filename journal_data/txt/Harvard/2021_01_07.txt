After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twice’s dazzling renditions of their hit singles “More & More” and “I Can’t Stop Me” at the 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards set the stage for an unexpected finale: the previously-unheard track “Cry for Me.” After their performance drew widespread praise online, the group officially released the song on December 18. With catchy melodies whose constant motion mirrors the lyrics’ ambivalence toward a difficult relationship, Twice’s surprise gift will surely bring tears of joy to fans’ eyes.
For the nine members of Twice — Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu — “Cry for Me” represents a remarkable willingness to explore new musical concepts. Emerging from a stately chorale of synths, Nayeon’s opening lines immediately create a different atmosphere from the carefree cheer that defined many of Twice’s early releases. “I know there’s no point trying to change you,” she begins, a blunt admission whose confidence sharpens as the underlying harmonies shift from minor to major and Mina brings the verse to an end over an intensifying beat.
Following the light but resolute tone of alternating lines from Dahyun and Momo, Jeongyeon’s powerful voice carries the track to its soaring first chorus, where Jihyo invokes the title in a burst of energy: “I want you to cry, cry for me / Just like I cried, cry for me.” The chorus takes a huge risk by combining two contrasting melodic motifs, but their development from the same chord progression provides both cohesion and refreshing variety.
The second verse offsets the chorus’ bold assurance. “I don’t know but I just can’t seem to hate you / Always defending you in front of my friends / Made a fool of myself,” Sana begins, with the music’s narrowing intervals and more frequent pauses highlighting the lyrics’ uncertainty. “Why do you keep smiling at me?” Chaeyoung continues. “Just one tear is all it takes.”
For the rest of the song, Nayeon’s occasional harmonizing embellishes but never overpowers her groupmates’ voices. Along with Mina and Tzuyu, she lends the bridge a measured, tentative character that only amplifies the impact of the final chorus. After a turbulent musical and emotional journey, the faint echo of Chaeyoung’s last line is as surprising a statement as “Cry for Me” itself.

When Lindsey Radice isn’t working 12 hour days as a nurse, she’s writing music as PYNKIE — an indie rocker known for her signature starry-eyed sound. From March to June, Radice was on the front lines of the pandemic response in New Jersey while simultaneously working on her latest album “#37.” The album is Radice’s second as PYNKIE and is inspired by ‘90s alternative. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Radice about her new album, working as a nurse during COVID-19, and the artists that most excite her.
The Harvard Crimson: In addition to making music, you're also a nurse. I'm sure that life has been pretty crazy for you this year. How have you been doing?
Lindsey Radice: It was crazy for like two months, maybe three months, a little bit of March, April, May, some of June. My unit that I usually work for is called ortho/neuro, and it's for people after certain surgeries like, hip, knee, spine, brain, sometimes. Bone and nervous system stuff. So when COVID started, we had to convert my unit into an extension of the ICU. I'm not ICU-certified, so I didn't work there.
It was crazy. It was different then what I'm used to, and we had to wear all this crazy equipment. And you know, it felt risky and harder. One of my patients died. A lot of them had to be rushed off the unit to the ICU because the oxygen levels just randomly dropped so low that it was an emergency. It was unpredictable. But yeah, that's it really. Now it's back to normal since like, June-ish. We went back to our unit. But you know, business as usual.
THC: When you're not at work, what has your quarantine routine been like?
LR: Quarantine is cool because a lot of times I'm a social butterfly, and I go out a lot. Like, hang out with people. And that's not really too great for creativity. That's why it takes me so long. So during quarantine, I couldn't really go out so much and couldn't really see people. Being shut inside, I could make demos and it gave me more time to create until I started making stuff with my boyfriend who I was staying with and am living with. We started making stuff together, separate from my PYNKIE stuff. He calls himself Social Media. But anyway, so yeah, we were making stuff together. I was coming up with some demo ideas or whatever comes next with PYNKIE. It was just a good time to be able to sit down.
THC: Besides having more time to record and stuff, how did you feel like quarantine affected your songwriting?
LR: I get more inspired when things around me are different or weird. Or if I go to a new place, new people — things like that always inspired me to want to make a song. So even if I don't make things about COVID or about quarantine, it's like that weird situation is inspiring.
THC: Was your latest album something that you were working on prior to COVID? Or something that came about during quarantine?
LR: Yeah, that's something I've been working on since, like, 2019. I've been working on it for a while, but it was delayed by quarantine and by a lot of other things. So I started things over a lot with the album, and I scrapped a lot of things I didn't like. But yeah, I didn't make any of those songs during quarantine. That's all whatever comes next.
THC: So, it's called #37. Could you speak on the significance of the title?
LR: Yeah, so it's because of my mom's first husband. She's married a couple times, but her first husband was before I was born when she had my two older sisters. He died. And they were really young, like 19, early 20s — they got married after high school. His high school football number was 37. Her and my sisters, my two older sisters, would find the number and see it everywhere. And it just rubbed off on me. Especially when I was making the album, I would see it. That's why I like it.
THC: Musically, could you speak on the inspirations that influenced this project? Like who you've been listening to that inspired you?
LR: Yeah, I don't really think of other artists when I'm making songs. That's not how I get inspired, usually, but subconsciously, definitely. I hear some things happening because I listened to a lot of Liz Phair. And I also listen to Soccer Mommy. I like alternative '90s stuff — I listen to Sonic Youth. One of my favorite albums is a song called “Copacetic” by Velocity Girl. It's just a weird album that probably not a lot of people know about, but it was on Sub Pop Records back in the '90s. It was so good.
THC: Who would be your dream collaborator? If you could work with anyone?
LR: I would die if I worked with Liz Phair. Or Soccer Mommy. Yeah, and Okay Kaya who I just spoke about I would absolutely love to even just talk to her. Those are the first ones that come to mind.
THC: What’s next for PYNKIE? Another solo project after this album?
LR: I want to do a new album, obviously, but I take forever to finish things. I think it'll be more of a different kind of feel, like maybe not real drums, but maybe a drum beat with like, acoustic guitar and weirdness. And, I don't know, maybe a more stripped-down feel back to my roots kind of thing. I definitely plan on another album in the next year hopefully.

With “The Food Villain,” The Alchemist delivers an effortlessly laid-back album filled with concise production and fun references to his rapper friends. A decidedly lighthearted departure from his collaborative efforts, the album’s unconventional Sunday release coincided with his 43rd birthday.
The album is the rapper-producer’s second solo outing of this year, but he has kept busy throughout 2020. Alchemist is primarily known for working with other artists, beginning his career as a close partner of foundational NYC rap duo Mobb Deep in the ’90s. With his signature throwback sound and reliance on samples, he has helped to shape modern rap for more than 20 years. Just looking at the past year, Alchemist released an album with Detroit MC Boldy James in February and Conway the Machine in March. In May, he teamed up with Freddie Gibbs to create a full length project. Alchemist also has credits on recent projects from Action Bronson and Westside Gunn.
Compared to his hard-hitting collaborations, “The Food Villain” is short and sweet. With 16 tracks and a run time of 25 minutes, each song is just over a minute long. All but two are instrumentals. The two vocal tracks on the album are delivered by Action Bronson and Big Body Bes, continuing the trend from Alchemist’s last solo outing that featured just one rap song with Westside Gunn. Without much rapping, the album is a low stakes beat pack that is a genuinely relaxing listen.
The lack of lyrical content allows Alchemist to have fun with his sampling. Where the vocal samples on his collaborations often come from classic gangster movies and TV shows, his new album showcases more humorous clips. The project prominently features soundbites from the Viceland food show “F*ck That’s Delicious,” which stars Alchemist and rappers Action Bronson, Meyhem Lauren, and Big Body Bes. The first track on the project, “Alan,” has a quote from Bronson flippantly talking about Alchemist: “He’s a villain. He’s a villainous person.” Each song is named for a quote from the show, like track six “Cheese is Overrated” and track 14 “This Isn’t Good.” The eleventh track, “Skeptical about Goat,” contains a soundbite from Meyhem Lauren: “I like Al, but I would trade his friendship for a good oyster.” Expertly woven into the fabric of each beat, the snippets are quite funny whenever they pop up.
Humor notwithstanding, Alchemist maintains the high quality beat-making that established his brand. The album certainly isn’t even close to his best work, but for such a relaxed project, it’s leagues above almost any other current producer. On “A Villainous Person” Alchemist brings in low-end piano and swinging drums for a similar sound to his joint projects with Boldy James. The melodic trumpet on “Lamb Sauce” is perfectly layered over the top of melodic piano, giving the beat an eerie lilt that could be looped endlessly. “Afterschool” and “Cigarette Drum Machine” feature longline melodies that make for very easy and enjoyable listening. Each beat is neatly packaged and doesn’t overstay its welcome. The album flows consistently from beat to beat with no stalls or low points.
The two vocal tracks featuring Action Bronson and Big Body Bes are incredibly satisfying. On “I Hate Everything,” Bronson raps over a gaudy piano loop that perfectly compliments his flow. Only a minute in length, the track feels like an interlude off of “Lamb over Rice,” the 2019 collab album from Bronson and Alchemist. On the track, Bronson’s lyricism matches the light hearted tone and food theme of the rest of the project: “Three Michelin Stars not impressed / I hate everything.” The song with Big Body Bes “Islamic Excellence” showcases a slow, lush beat populated with multiple layers of saxophone, piano, and drums. The beat allows Bes to use his spoken word flow with full bravado and style: “I love pain / I love dark / I love hurt / I love bleed.” The track is one of the few solo Bes tracks in existence, perhaps an early taste of his long awaited debut album “Body Language.”
“The Food Villain” is a solid addition to The Alchemist’s nearly flawless discography. The food theme and humor in his sampling makes the album a more cohesive project than many of his other instrumental albums. Even on such a low-stakes album, Alchemist easily continues to outpace other producers that attempt to mimic his sound, thanks to his superior layering and veteran instinct for melody. All in all, the album makes one hell of a birthday present to himself.

King Princess is no stranger to pairing infectious melodies with heartbreak. Her newest track, “Only Time Makes It Human” — the singer’s first release since the deluxe version of “Cheap Queen” debuted in February — exists as a shining testament to this fact.
In “Only Time Makes It Human,” King Princess sings candidly about the pain of unrequited love while simultaneously begging her readers to dance along to the ’80s pop-inspired tune. Through her lyrics, King Princess unapologetically explores and unpacks her own conflicting emotions about the circumstance. “I wanna know about letting go / Cutting all ties could be beautiful, babe,” she sings about the allure of getting some distance from a loved one before immediately changing her mind: “I know you told me you'd never call / It pisses me off how you never call (Never call).”
The same whiplash King Princess feels in her intentions, listeners feel in the track. Despite its vulnerable subject matter, “Only Time Makes It Human” is an undeniably upbeat song. Deep, thumping bass lines and sharp snare hits in the song's verses contrast with shimmering guitar playing and velvety harmonies in the intro and chorus to create a dynamic fabric of sound.
The contrast in the song’s two sections — the full, sparkling musicality of the chorus and the minimalistic beats of the verses — provides a mirror to King Princess’s own drivers and emotions. The unrequited love in question both destroys her (““And it sucks that I think about her / 'Cause thinking 'bout her leaves me lonely”) and motivates her (“And it's not that I wanna suffer / But thinking of her keeps me going”). Despite the outward contradictions, however, both emotions are true, much like the distinct sounds in the track, which complement each other to create something honest and real.
Unfortunately, King princess still doesn’t seem to have had enough time to be fully human yet. The track’s music video features a digitally rendered King Princess slouching around an aestheticized ’90s-style apartment as she admires the real-life version of her in screens and reflections. All washed in light blue and pastel pink, the video mimics the bright musical landscape of the track itself, creating a whole new world in which King Princess can explore the space between the real-her (the lyrics) and the synthetic one (the music).
In the video, the song’s chorus is accompanied by an emotionless, 3D King Princess surrounded by screens that feature her real-life counterpart in the bouts of catharsis. Just like the synthetic quality of the video doesn’t allow for any emotional release from the animated King Princess, neither does the act of writing music itself allow for an opportunity to let go for the artist. “Whoo, and I'll keep selling all my problems / And she'll be the one who buys 'em / Whoo, all of her love became an album / And I'm still the one who's crying,” King Princess sings, committing herself to repeat the same act that she claims doesn’t work to solve her pain.
By the end of the track, King Princess seemingly has yet to decide what she wants moving forward. “Who she was / When she was my girl,” she sings over and over again in the song’s bridge, choosing to focus on the relationship’s past rather than a potential future without it. This, perhaps, is the most human part of the song. She doesn’t claim to have gotten over her emotions nor found a panacea, but goes on anyway creating music and sharing the deepest parts of herself.

Perhaps the best thing an AC/DC song can sound like is, well, an AC/DC song. Or, at least, that’s what one would gather from listening to the rock group’s latest single, “Shot In The Dark.”
Written sometime before the passing of the rock and roll band’s co-founder and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young in 2017, the track was released on Oct. 7 in anticipation of the band’s upcoming album, “Power Up.” The first single off the album, “Shot In The Dark” is pure, unbridled AC/DC — signifying a major comeback for the Australian band after their  2016 hiatus.
The track begins with co-founder Angus Young’s sludgy, bluesy guitar playing as it leads the way for Brian Johnson’s iconic metal-tinged vocals and Phil Rudd’s sharp, violent drumming. Immediately, the powerful combination of hard rock riffs and bluesy bass lines makes clear that “Shot In The Dark” is primed to join the ranks of AC/DC classics. In fact, the track debuted at number five on Billboard’s mainstream rock charts on Oct. 17, making it the first song to chart so highly with its debut in over a decade.
At a time of change and general strangeness, “Shot In The Dark” reliably brings listeners back to a time when things were simpler: the mid ‘80s. “Blasting on the radio, breaking on the TV show / Send it out on all the wires / And if I didn't know any better, your mission is to party / Till the broad daylight,” Johnson sings of his entourage’s late-night antics, his voice raging over a heavy mix of crashing cymbals, thumping bass lines, and gritty power chord guitars.
Where the track’s lyrics fail in terms of relatability to the current, they make up for in nostalgia points. With “Shot In The Dark,” AC/DC immerses listeners in the height of ’80s debauchery and rock mythology, where rockstars would spend the nights partying without a care (and superfans would spend their days pissing off their parents by playing AC/DC’s music too loud in their basement). Young’s soaring guitar shredding at the song’s bridge provides the final ingredient to complete the modern classic.
More and more artists are turning to their own versions of quarantine-ready music, like Taylor Swift’s stripped-back “Folklore” or Fiona Apple’s musically expansive “Fetch the Bolt Cutters.” AC/DC, however, breaks from that narrative. Instead, they choose to stick to what they know best, and with it provide a deeply needed sense of continuity within the greater sphere of rock and roll legend.

Demi Lovato has returned to the stage in 2020: After performing at the Grammy’s in January, she’s released a total of five singles so far this year. This time, she’s back with a crystal-clear message for President Trump in her newest release.
Lovato released “Commander in Chief” in October, just a few weeks ahead of the presidential election. The track is a politically-charged, aching ballad that takes a two-pronged approach to responding to the many crises the US currently faces — both an open letter to President Trump and a rallying cry for American voters.
Lovato has never been one to shy away from discussing difficult topics in her music. Most of her recent singles prior to “Commander in Chief” draw from her personal experiences and struggles. “Anyone” is an harrowingly candid admission of hardship and hopelessness; “I Love Me” and “Still Have Me” deal with self-image, self-love, and healing; “OK Not to Be OK,” as its title suggests, grapples with mental health and offers its listeners validation and reassurance. “Commander in Chief,” however, trades Lovato’s usual highly personal introspection for a perspective that emphasizes the power of the collective. As Lovato takes aim at the Trump administration’s attacks on human dignities and ambivalence towards inequality and suffering, she reassures the President that “our” fight is far from over. She sings, “Won’t give up, stand our ground / We’ll be in the streets while you’re bunkering down / Loud and proud, best believe / We’ll still take a knee while you’re / Commander in chief.”
The track’s slow, somber ambience is reminiscent of that of a breakup song. Lovato blends muted organ tones with a gentle piano for a melancholic yet unassuming sound. “Commander in Chief” may not be Lovato’s most complex piece, but it’s still powerful in its simplicity. The track’s vocals are similarly subdued: Opting for a softer, more pensive delivery, Lovato hesitates to use the full force of her vocals. She doesn’t sing with the same bravado that she does in “Still Have Me,” for example, but this choice is noteworthy in and of itself.
Although Lovato’s delicate, despondent tone sometimes feels at odds with the song’s ultimate message of resilience and resistance, her expressive vocals are pleading, effectively conveying the song’s emotional nuances. Lovato isn’t angry; she doesn’t belt. Above all else, she sounds tired: Like so many Americans, Lovato is weary of the Trump administration. In the second verse, she’s joined on the refrain by a chorus of voices that remain with her throughout the piece. Both soothing and soulful, the track’s melodic choral accompaniment again shows that there’s power in community.
Lovato and her background chorus sing directly to President Trump, addressing numerous current events in a series of clever, evocative lines. She told CNN in a recent interview, “There's been so many times that I've wanted to write the President a letter or sit down with him and ask him these questions… and then I thought… one way that I could do that is writing a song and releasing it for the whole world to hear and then he has to answer those questions to everyone and not just me.” Indeed, Lovato asks questions that weigh on the minds of so many: “Do you even know the truth? / We're in a state of crisis, people are dyin'/ While you line your pockets deep.” She also draws reference to the 2020 California wildfires, further critiquing Trump’s inaction: “Shuttin’ down systems for personal gain / Fightin’ fires with flyers and prayin’ for rain.” But perhaps the track’s most resonant lyric is its chorus’ conclusion: “Commander in Chief, how does it feel to still / Be able to breathe?”
In this line, Lovato brings together the US’ two pandemics — COVID-19 and racism — and highlights Trump’s contemptible disregard for both. While the President is still “able to breathe,” so many have lost their lives to the coronavirus and to systemic oppression and police brutality: A slogan closely associated with the Black Lives Matter Movement, the phrase “I Can’t Breathe” was one of the last spoken by Eric Garner, George Floyd, and countless other Black individuals killed at the hands of police.
Both timely and vivid, “Commander and Chief” is a viable entry into the genre of protest music. Of course, Lovato’s epistolary approach to engaging musically with politics is nothing new; many elements of “Commander in Chief” remain strikingly similar to “Dear Mr. President,” P!nk’s 2006 pop-rock open letter to then-president George W. Bush, for example. Nevertheless, the track’s lyrics are both thoughtful and critical and its emphasis on civic engagement is more important than ever. As the song urged, Americans voted in historically high numbers in the 2020 election. In the election’s wake, it’s time for the second part of her challenge — for President Trump to answer for his actions.

Despite stay-at-home orders and COVID-19 restrictions, Harvard senior Joy Nesbitt had a busy summer. A joint concentrator in Social Anthropology and Music, Nesbitt spent her days directing two virtual Harvard productions (“R+J: An Ultramodern Fantasia” and “God of Carnage”), participating as a mentee in Alicia Keys’ non-profit organization She Is The Music, releasing songs inspired by current events, and polishing her most recent album, “Atlas Rising,” out next month. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Nesbitt to discuss her journey to becoming a singer-songwriter and director, her latest musical and directorial projects, and how her identity as a Black woman shapes her work and encourages her to explore the intersection of social justice and art.
The Harvard Crimson: What first got you into music and directing?
Joy B. Nesbitt: My parents were always playing music for me, and I think they didn't realize how much it was indoctrinating me and making me feel connected to storytelling in the form of music and complete agency over that storytelling. And so as a young kid a lot of the time you'd only really get to sing in a musical because that's how children work. And so I started acting in Dallas, and after a while it became this confab of both music and theater at the same time. And I realized that I really don't like when people tell me what to do, so I started directing! … I find it really empowering to push a story out and use it as a means of connecting to others, and so music and directing kind of jumped into the same boat for me.
THC: Would you say that most of your creative process begins with a feeling and experience you had?
JBN: It always starts with an emotion. I recently did “God of Carnage” earlier this summer, and that show is filled with anxiety and rage and also deep, deep comedy, which are all feelings that I feel like converge and have converged throughout the summer with COVID and all the shit that's been going on. It's been focused generally on making sure that energy and that emotion is depicted properly.
THC: You had a really busy summer. Not only did you direct, but you were also a songwriting mentee in the She Is The Music Connect Together Mentorship Program. She Is The Music is a non-profit organization seeking to increase “the number of women working in music.” What is the value in amplifying female creators' voices?
JBN: I think the value in amplifying female creators' voices is [that] women have an experience that is extremely intersectional. It's important to get the storylines and the experiences of women who have varying different identities that are coalesced upon womanhood, and I think that there's something palpable and important in that intersection right there. When you hear things like “Mississippi Goddam,” that song by Nina Simone has both the experience of being Black and a woman in America at that very moment. And I think if we didn't have those experiences, music would be and wouldn't have a lot of the representation necessary for us all to survive.
THC: Would you say that your experiences as a Black woman are central to your songwriting process?
JBN: Definitely. I just feel like in my music and especially with this album, all of the music is informed by the fact that I personally felt affected by the things that have been happening this summer and I also empathize with those who were at the front lines, most of whom were Black women. And I felt like if I didn't unpack those things for myself, then it would have been even more of an oppressive period of my life.
THC: How would you respond to people who critique the intersection of social justice, activism, and art?
JBN: I think I would say, ‘Where do you get off?’ I think that the thing is [social justice] movements are motivated and captured by art and if we didn't have things like — this is so pretentious, I hate it — Dadaism, right, if we didn’t have [Marcel] Duchamp signing a urinal and saying it's art, would we have art? Will we have the feelings and the emotions at all right now? That anger that people derived from seeing that piece of art moved art movements, it moved people to protest, it moved people to try to upend civil governments in a way that matters. And even more so if we look at, for example, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s song “WAP,” that song — as crass as it is, it’s dope, I like it — but that song, that anger that people felt about being either sexually repressed or being sexually exposed, has created a conversation that is important that we should be having at this moment. And so if we didn't have art, the movement would not have an extra voice to unpack things. It wouldn't make any sense.
THC: What did you wish to accomplish through writing your newest album “Atlas Rising”?
JBN: I definitely stumbled into writing the album, which is funny. I started off writing “Echo,” which is one of the singles that I put out, and I wanted to write that song because I had had a conversation with my father about how he was feeling the same anxiety during the summer that he had felt at as a young man in 1968, just in watching the news. I was really moved by that story, and so I wrote “Echo” as a bit of a homage to him, but also as a means of thinking about inheritance and how we inherit the experiences and the issues that we're seeing today and how we can use that as both hope — we've made it so far and we can keep going — and we can also use it as just kind of a crazy thought to think about the things that were issues a while ago are still issues now and that's a problem and we need to fix that. And so after writing that, I was feeling a lot more feelings and I felt like it was important to write out a complete thought in the form of an album of where are we at right now, and where am I at in terms of growing up in a space where a lot of structures that were tried and true in the U.S. are being torn down. And so I hope that if people hear it, they're hearing that journey that I experienced and they're also questioning whether or not they have also had those thoughts or whether if they've never had those thoughts, are they thoughts that are important to them at all?
THC: Do you ever consider the possibility of there being a group of people who won't understand your story because they don't share your identity as a Black woman?
JBN: I definitely consider that. I mean I would hope that they can connect with the core emotion that I'm expressing in the music and they don't have to be the same as somebody to empathize, but if someone doesn't understand that's totally their prerogative. I mean, I think that what’s interesting about music is that, despite the fact that you may not understand the words, you can still groove, right? But of course it's more meaningful if I hear somebody like Beyonce giving me “Lemonade,” and I feel like that music is connected to my identity and my heart. I should hope that people can connect to that and can empathize, but if they don't, that's fine.
THC: Who has been your greatest inspiration and if you could tell them one thing right now, what would it be?
JBN: I'm really inspired by my grandmother. Everything that she does is motivated by love. And I think that the work that I do is inspired by that focus of ‘I love theater’ or ‘I love that so-and-so is in this production and so I want to make this production as healthy as possible.’ Or, ‘I love my dad so I want to write this song about him.’ I think I'm most inspired by those kinds of conversations and I'm most inspired by the way that she moves through space. If I were to speak to her about it, I think I would just thank her for instilling me with that sense of grounding and tell her that the work that I do is all for her and all for people like her.
Nesbitt’s album “Atlas Rising” is slated for release on February 19, 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zaosong Zheng, a former researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, was sentenced on Wednesday for lying to federal agents in connection with his attempt to take cancer research to China.
U.S. District Court Judge Denise J. Casper sentenced Zheng to time served — approximately 87 days — and three years of supervised release, as well as ordering his removal from the United States.
Zheng’s lawyers wrote in a Tuesday sentencing memo that Zheng has tickets to return to China Wednesday and has agreed to not return to the U.S. for at least 10 years.
Zheng — a 31-year-old who arrived in the United States from China in 2018 — pleaded guilty to lying to customs officials last month. On December 10, 2019, Zheng was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport after customs officials found vials of biological material in a sock packed in his suitcase. Beth Israel fired Zheng following his arrest.
Customs officials had flagged Zheng as high-risk for smuggling biological material; while searching his luggage, they found the vials, allegedly containing material from a Beth Israel laboratory. During the search, Zheng repeatedly denied carrying the research materials, according to an affidavit. Later, he said the vials had “nothing to do with his research” and that a friend had provided him with the vials.
Eventually, Zheng confessed to stealing the material from his lab and said he planned to take it to his own laboratory in China in order to publish research in his name.
As part of his December plea deal, prosecutors agreed to drop the charge alleging Zheng attempted to smuggle goods out of the country. Federal statute allows sentencing of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 for the remaining false statements charge.
Norman S. Zalkind, one of Zheng’s attorneys, said he viewed Wednesday’s sentencing as “partly a position the government is taking about Chinese scientists at this time” and contested the value of the biological material with which Zheng was caught.
“The only thing that [Zheng] did wrong was not tell the truth to custom agents at the airport and nothing else,” Zalkind said. “The government has agreed to that, but they keep saying that he stole something.”
“I think, if he was an American citizen, I don’t think any of the punishment would have happened,” Zalkind added.
David Duncan, one of Zheng’s other attorneys, pointed out in an email that Zheng took DNA expression vectors from the laboratory, which he wrote “can be made inexpensively by someone with limited biomedical training.”
His attorneys wrote in the sentencing memo that Zheng has not been convicted of either stealing or smuggling the materials.
“The government, in detention proceedings, made much of the allegation that the biological materials in Dr. Zheng’s suitcase were ‘stolen’ from the lab he worked in,” they wrote. “In its Sentencing Memorandum, the government now agrees that the materials have ‘little value’ and are easily replicated – indeed they suggest that Dr. Zheng made them.”
“He was never charged with theft of anything, and he denies that he had any purpose in taking this material with him other than to continue the research he was conducting as part of the Beth Israel/[Deaconess] lab he was employed by,” they added.
Zheng’s arrest formed part of a recent crackdown on intellectual property theft, which also has included the arrest of former Harvard Chemistry chair Charles M. Lieber on allegations he lied to federal authorities about his research affiliations with China. Lieber has pleaded not guilty to the charges and intends to bring the case to trial.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Design will no longer refer to one of its houses as the Philip Johnson Thesis House in response to an open letter criticizing its namesake’s white supremacist views, Dean Sarah M. Whiting wrote in a letter last month.
Though the house did not have an official name, it was often called the Philip Johnson Thesis House or Thesis House because it was the thesis project of architect Philip C. Johnson ’27 when he attended the GSD in the 1940s. The building, which is owned by the GSD, will now be formally referred to by its physical address: 9 Ash St.
Whiting’s statement said removing the name was just one step in addressing Johnson’s legacy and other figures who contributed to what she called the “white supremacy of architecture.”
“[Johnson’s] racism, his fascism, and his strenuous support of white supremacy have absolutely no place in design,” she wrote in the Dec. 5 letter.
The high-profile open letter that Whiting was responding to, dated Nov. 27, was written by the Johnson Study Group — a collective of prominent architects and designers — and called on the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the GSD, and other public-facing non-profits to excise Johnson’s name from public spaces and honorifics.
“There is a role for Johnson’s architectural work in archives and historic preservation,” the Johnson Study Group wrote. “However, naming titles and spaces inevitably suggests that the honoree is a model for curators, administrators, students and others who participate in these institutions.”
A prominent architect and curator, Johnson attended the College and later studied at the GSD. He worked as the first head of architecture and design at MoMA. His buildings include Manhattan’s Seagram Building and Lipstick Building, as well as a personal residence made entirely from glass — the “Glass House” — in Connecticut. He died in 2005.
But Johnson’s legacy has also been characterized by his widely documented white supremacist views. The Johnson Study Group’s letter noted that he attempted to form a fascist party, circulated Nazi publications, and did not feature a single work by a Black designer or architect during his five-decade tenure at MoMA.
Contemporary artist Xaviera Simmons lauded the GSD's “swift response,” but said it was only the first in a series of actions she hoped the school would take.
“It starts with bold moves like taking names off. It starts with supporting reparations for descendants of slavery. It starts with acknowledging the land theft of this country,” Simmons said.
Whiting’s statement claimed that removing Johnson’s name would be the first of many steps, as Simmons hoped.
“We do not pretend to think our work, as a school, ends here,” Whiting wrote. “At the GSD, we are committed to doing our part to bring much-needed, long-overdue change to the field, to a fundamental reorientation toward inclusion.”
Katherine “Kate” Orff, a landscape architect and MacArthur fellow who graduated from the GSD in 1997, signed the letter in support of the Johnson Study Group. In an email to The Crimson, she noted that anti-Semitism and racism have rarely been subjects of discussion amongst architects and designers.
“Everyone was so focused on glass and light and proportion that the literal Nazisim right in front of us was unseen,” Orff wrote. “I think people read the letter and think, ‘it is about time!’”
Orff added that in her field of design, legacies of colonialism and elitism still remain. More work is needed to promote inclusion, she wrote.
“If we want to forge new paths in design culture that are more shared, more collective, purposeful and more civic-minded, then we need to keep reassessing the legacy of figures like Johnson,” she wrote.
Design School professor Toshiko Mori, who had recommended in August 2020 that the GSD divest the house at 9 Ash St. to fund a new social justice program, applauded Whiting’s decision in an email.
“The renaming of the property proposed by Dean Whiting is a brilliant interim solution that directs us to carefully start to evaluate the School’s associations, actions and legacies pertaining to white supremacist and racist issues embedded within its history,” she wrote.
Despite the GSD decision, Johnson’s name remains on a MoMA exhibition gallery and in their title for the chief curator of architecture and design.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three Harvard political organizations condemned the riots at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. and called on national political leaders to do the same in a joint statement Wednesday evening.
The Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and the Harvard Undergraduates for Bipartisan Solutions all signed the statement.
A mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol Wednesday afternoon while Congress was counting electoral votes to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the November 2020 presidential election.
“Dissent is fundamental to democracy,” the statement reads. “But threatening the safety of members of Congress, journalists, staffers, Capitol employees, and all other bystanders is not dissent.”
“Representatives of the American people cannot be silent about the continuous attempts to discredit our electoral process. The words and actions of elected officials must reflect reality. After dozens of court cases and recounts, Congress must uphold its Constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 election,” the statement reads.
Jack A. White III ’23, the president of the Harvard Undergraduates for Bipartisan Solutions, said writing the statement was “a wonderful team effort” that gave the clubs the opportunity to collaborate, rather than focus on political differences.
“Everything that's going on right now, you can't really find anybody that agrees with it," White said. "I think it truly was the moment where we could bring this idea of, 'okay, where can we work together as campus parties, as opposed to opposing each other.'"
The Harvard Democrats also released an individual statement demanding Trump’s impeachment.
In the statement, the Democrats cited Trump’s failure to denounce the riots at the Capitol, claiming that he had “fully abandoned his oath of office.”
“The President of the United States has instigated and encouraged an insurrection that culminated with the occupation of the U.S. Capitol. Since he began his campaign for president, Donald Trump has spread violence-inducing misinformation and conspiracy theories, overreaching his authority to secure his position in power—no matter the cost to the American people and our democracy,” the statement reads. “It is now time for Republican elected officials to respond to President Trump’s subversion, and uphold their oaths to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
The Harvard Institute of Politics executive board also released a statement Wednesday evening, writing that the siege underscored “the urgent need to reimagine our civic life as student leaders.”
“The Institute of Politics is a virtual and physical space that strives to educate students on the importance of civic engagement, public service, and the role of political activism to better our world,” the statement reads. "We believe that now more than ever, the mission and the lessons we learn together could not be more applicable."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Cooperative Society announced in late December that its flagship Harvard Square store, located at 1400 Massachusetts Ave., will temporarily close for renovations, with plans to reopen in April.
With the flagship store closed, all books and other merchandise have been relocated from the Massachusetts Avenue Coop building to the store's Palmer Street location.
Coop President Jeremiah P. Murphy Jr. ’73 explained that the planning process for the renovations started about a year ago, but it was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. A reduction in foot traffic during the pandemic made closing the building the best option to allow for greater efficiency in the renovation process.
“At the time, we were planning on opening sometime in early May in time for Harvard commencement,” Murphy said. “Now, obviously, it looks like the commencement is not going to be physical, it’s going to be remote, but, still, I think it’s important to be open in time for the commencement.”
Murphy added that the goal for renovating the building is to provide a better shopping environment for Coop patrons and to better support social distancing guidelines amid the pandemic.
“Our plan is to make it a much better customer member experience when it's finished in terms of the air conditioning,” Murphy said. “It's actually going to be able to allow us to probably do some things that we would need to do as a retailer anyway for dealing with the pandemic in terms of spacing, crowded aisles, as well as contactless doors and things like that.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that the renovations would boost business for other Harvard Square retailers.
“It's helpful actually, you know, to have all the construction workers because many of them drink coffee and many need lunch,” Jillson said. “They can certainly get their coffee and buy lunch and support the local businesses.”
“We welcome the construction, we welcome the workers, and we hope that they come hungry,” she added.
Emily M. Qiu ’24, a Coop patron, wrote in an email to The Crimson that she will continue to frequent the Coop despite the renovations.
“Personally, as long as I know where the COOP is being relocated to and it's still easily accessible, I'll probably still visit every once in a while just like I did before,” she wrote. “I usually like to look at merch in the COOP, and I feel like they have a really large selection to choose from, so I think many people would still continue to go.”
Christie Choi ’24, another Coop shopper, said the renovations might discourage shoppers from going to Coop stores.
“The Palmer Street store is going to be more densely packed,” she said. “With social distancing guidelines, the Palmer Street store might either become very crowded, or there might be long lines outside the store.”
Still, she said the renovations have not personally affected her or her shopping habits.
“I don’t think that the Coop renovations will make it harder for me to access school supplies, merch, or textbooks,” she said. “I hope they keep the spiral staircases though.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard faculty reacted with shock and frustration — but often little surprise — to the storming of the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob Wednesday that disrupted the counting of electoral votes.
Chaos erupted in Washington, D.C. Wednesday afternoon when rioters breached the Capitol, forcing the Senate to be cleared out and Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers to be evacuated to secure locations. Amid the riots, a woman was shot and killed, and several explosives were discovered around Capitol Hill.
Police managed to clear the mob from the Capitol by early evening, and lawmakers resumed the vote count around 8 p.m.
In an email, Government professor Daniel P. Carpenter described Wednesday’s events as “an attack on the legislative foundations of our democratic republic.”
“We are distinguished from monarchies and autocracies by the fact that we observe lawful transitions of power guided by elections,” Carpenter wrote. “The Capitol has been cleared of the mob, but that lawful transition of power was disrupted today by the very incumbent officeholder who stands to be ousted by popular sovereignty and by lawful procedures.”
In an email, Law School professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 wrote he couldn’t “think of” a precedent for the insurrection.
Still, Government professor Steven R. Levitsky — who authored the book “How Democracies Die” — said the violence that occurred Wednesday was a predictable conclusion to Donald J. Trump’s presidency.
“This is what happens when not just Trump, but much of the Republican Party leadership, in a polarized political setting, spends four years lying to its base — working its base into a frenzy telling its base that the other side are traitors, that the other side are trying to destroy the country, that the other side stole the election,” Levitsky said.
“If you spend four years mobilizing the base into outrage, you’re very likely to get this sort of violent mobilization,” he added.
African and African American Studies and Government professor Jennifer L. Hochschild said the insurrection in Washington, D.C. could also be partially attributed to societal anxiety “that’s erupting in all kinds of weird ways.”
“There’s economic anxiety, there’s racial anxiety. There’s probably gender. Most of these people were men — 30-ish-year old white men who either don’t have a job or are worried about their jobs,” Hochschild said.
Government professor Daniel F. Ziblatt, who co-authored “How Democracies Die” with Levitsky, said Republican voters are also anxious about a reduction in their ranks: many are “rural, white, and Christian Americans, who are a declining segment of the electorate, but who are over-represented in the Republican Party and in our political system,” he said.
“So, out of a certain kind of desperation, there’s a fomenting of this fear,” he said.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 wrote in an email that the storming of the Capitol “must not be allowed to stand as a precedent for the future.”
“Trump won election as a demagogue and he goes out as one,” Mansfield wrote. “But the future problem is more with his supporters than with him. Republicans will have to educate them in how to lose.”
Levitsky held Republicans’ accommodations of Trump’s behavior — several GOP lawmakers hoped to use the ceremonial vote count to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s election victory — responsible for Wednesday’s complications to the electoral certification process, inside and outside of the Capitol building.
“Trump deserves a lot of blame for this,” he said. “But he wouldn't have been President of the United States, he wouldn't have stayed President of the United States, and he wouldn't have taken his little post election adventure beyond November 5, had it not been for the enabling of the Republican Party.”
Government lecturer Maxine Isaacs said the violent scene at the Capitol was in part due to Trump’s incompetence as well as to his incitement.
“Here’s all these people breaking into the Capitol, sitting with their feet up on the speaker’s desk, sitting in the speaker’s chair, and he’s watching television,” she said.
“When he finally came out at the end of the day, he said, ‘I love you, but go home’ – he was totally ineffective,” she said. “I mean, even if he wanted to encourage them it wasn’t really encouragement.”
Ziblatt added that the situation could have been worse.
“This is not a political leader who has a master plan to carry out the implementation of a coup where the military will come,” Ziblatt said. “So he’s working from a very weak position, for which we can be thankful.”
Ziblatt also said that a “fracture” could emerge between the “Trumpist” and more moderate wings of the Republican Party, and that such a split could present its own dangers to American democracy.
“In my own studies of conservative parties and conservative movements throughout history, a danger is when instead of the mainstream party encompassing these radical elements and keeping them under control, they lose control of them,” he said. “And then you have a large segment of the electorate and some politicians who represent that segment of the electorate who are entirely disconnected from any moderating influence.”
Hochschild said Wednesday’s events and the weeks to follow could potentially chart the Republican Party’s course for the future, including a dissolution similar to that of the Whig Party in the 1850s.
“It’s possible that that’s what we’re in the middle of here with the Republican Party — today, last Saturday, God only knows what will happen over the next two weeks — will drive the genuinely conservative Republicans away from the increasingly small, but radicalized Trumpist supporters,” Hochschild said, referring to a call Trump made last Saturday asking Georgia officials to subvert the election by finding votes for him. “But I’m not sure that they’ll disappear when Trump disappears — so the Republican Party may be just breaking up.”
American History professor Jill M. Lepore wrote in an email she believes a transition of power might take place before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
“I do not think Trump’s presidency will endure until Biden’s inauguration,” Lepore wrote.
Twelve Harvard affiliates, including Levitsky and Hochschild, had co-signed an open letter Wednesday demanding the immediate removal of Trump from office through the impeachment process or the invocation of the 25th Amendment. Dartmouth professor Brendan Nyhan started the letter and more than 800 fellow political scientists had signed as of 11:30 p.m.
“Our profession seeks to understand politics, not engage in it, but we share a commitment to democratic values. The President’s actions threaten American democracy,” the letter reads. “He has rejected the peaceful transfer of power, encouraged state legislators to overturn election results in their states, pressured a state official to change election results, and now incited a violent mob that shut down the counting of electoral votes and stormed the U.S. Capitol.”
Government professor Ryan D. Enos said he signed on to the letter since he saw Wednesday’s riots as “a very clear sign that our democracy is under threat.”
“It’s possible that a real dark Pandora's box has been opened in American democracy, and that we will not get out of the situation without something radical happening,” Enos said. “And that radical could be something violent like we witnessed today, or it could be something where we really change people’s lives for the better.”
Harvard Kennedy School professor Arthur I. Applbaum wrote in an email that “what this means is up to us.” He called on the Republican Party to censure Trump for inciting mob violence, for civilian police to clear the Capitol grounds, and for Congress to resume the electoral vote count.
“Congress is a legislative body, not a building, and it must reconvene at once in a secure and preferably magisterial location to take up the work of certifying Joe Biden's election to the presidency publicly,” wrote Applbaum, a professor of democratic values and political leadership. “If the congressional coup plotters have not been shamed by today’s events into dropping their mendacious stunt, then they should be outvoted in both chambers expeditiously, with an incisive rebuttal from one member of each party.”
“If much of this happens, then what today means for American democracy is that we stared into the abyss and pulled back,” Applbaum added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates living in Washington, D.C. said they felt shock, frustration, and worry as a mob waving Trump flags violently stormed the Capitol building during the Electoral College vote certification process on Wednesday.
The mob forced members of Congress to evacuate and halted the certification process. The demonstrators gathered to support President Donald J. Trump along with a faction of congressional Republicans that aimed to contest the election results based on debunked claims of voter fraud.
Several students living in D.C. reported staying indoors despite the historical significance of the moment to avoid the ongoing demonstrations during the vote certification process.
“Although it was in a sense something of history in the making, it wasn't necessarily a history we wanted to be too close to, so we stayed put at home,” Kira L. Medish ’21 said. “But I think for a number of reasons, we were all sitting there for many hours, just watching it. It's kind of like being in a state of shock. You can't really take your eyes away from the screen.”
Despite the frequency of protests in D.C., College students living in the area said that the violence of the riot Wednesday afternoon shocked them.
“I kind of expected this to be one of the smaller rallies,” Afia S. Tyus ’20-’21 said. “The Trump rallies generally get overcrowded by counter-protests, and this is kind of the first that has really gained traction. So this was honestly shocking.”
Many students said that they were “upset,” “angry,” and “disappointed” as the riot went on.
“Somebody [walked] with a Confederate flag through the Capitol building. That is just so deeply wrong,” Sophia “Rocket” Claman ’21, who is a Crimson Blog editor, said. “This was just an attempt to thwart democracy and refuse to accept election results, and it was a seditious act, and it was spurred on by the President of the United States.”
“It's embarrassing. And it's really disappointing and frustrating, and it has made me really, really angry,” she added.
Andrew S. Jing ’24 said seeing people flood the floors of the House and Senate was “surreal,” given the stringent security measures that visitors to the Capitol must adhere to during regular tours of the building.
Jing added that, as a D.C. native, seeing the demonstrations on the Capitol Hill was “really hard.”
“It's really hard to imagine if you're not from D.C., but the one thing that I've learned this year is that when the news is close to home, it becomes extremely visceral, and it's in your backyard,” Jing said.
A concern among D.C. residents is that many violent demonstrators do not realize the impact their actions have on the surrounding neighborhoods, according to Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22. She said the racially-charged rhetoric invoked in these riots have created an unsafe environment for Black families.
“These riots show how so many people view D.C. as a political playground in that they see it as a place they can come and express their frustrations, overwhelmingly Trump supporters,” O’Sullivan said. “A lot of people don't see D.C. as a place where people live and have homes and families.”
“As a Black American living in D.C., it's scary seeing a city that at least, at one point, had a majority Black population now has people raising Confederate flags and hanging up nooses,” she said. “If anything, I hope this highlights a need for D.C. statehood and autonomy because the D.C. mayor and government could not enact anything without congressional approval.”
As the rioters descended on the Capitol, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser requested a full deployment of the D.C. National Guard, which had to be approved by the Pentagon because D.C. is not a state.
Some Harvard students also reported disparities in the police response to Wednesday’s insurrection compared to the Black Lives Matter protests last summer.
Naomi P. Davy ’22 said she noticed heavy security personnel during her time protesting for racial justice in D.C.
“I participated in the BLM protests over the summer and I know there was a lot of security there. I saw a military tank down at 16th Street,” Davy said. “Yet now I’m watching cops run away from protestors, which is really upsetting because what they’re doing can be akin to treason or sedition.”
“The most glaring thing about this is the blatant double standard but as a Black woman this is to be expected, there's just more evidence to it these days,” she added. “It should be a message to the rest of America that something is wrong when there's less security and outrage for this than protests that say Black lives matter.”
Tyus agreed that the police response was “very different.”
“There is no way in hell a Black Lives Matter protest would ever have gotten this far. People would have been dead in the streets, and we would have seen it recorded, we would have seen it on screen,” she said.
Though Trump released a video on Twitter late in the afternoon telling demonstrators to "go home now,” Ben R. Schroeder ’24 said Trump’s response felt “underhanded.”
“He told his supporters to go home in the tone of someone who is contractually obligated to do so, like a sibling who was made to apologize by their parents, and spent most of the video complimenting the rioters,” Schroeder said.
He said that many Trump supporters likely interpreted the comments as validating their beliefs.
“What happened is the result of four years of the empowerment of these people and their beliefs,” he added.
Some students also commented on what the riot could mean for the protocols surrounding the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20.
“I think having so many people be so successful today in the riots means that people will hop in their cars from other states, from as far as they want to come,” Tyus said. “I assume that now, in light of everything that has happened today, that [the] inauguration will be even smaller.”
Schroeder said he believed the riots would not affect the legitimacy of Biden’s transfer of power, but expressed concerns about what such demonstrations meant for American democracy at large.
“I am 100 percent confident Biden will be inaugurated on January 20th,” he said. “I have worries about future transitions where it's about the faith the American public has in these institutions that are meant to aid in the peaceful transition of power.”
“I worry what that will mean for the future of our democracy,” Schroeder added.
