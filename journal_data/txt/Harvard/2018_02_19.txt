After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Directed by Jessi D. Hill, and performed by award-winning slam poet Kit Yan, “Queer Heartache,” attempted to explore the difficulties faced by the queer community on Feb. 9. Although the excessively long and poorly executed introduction nearly thwarted the entire performance from achieving its goals, Yan himself brought an artistic and emotional performance to the stage that was incredibly tangible.
As the background pop music faded and the lights dimmed, poet and artist Black Venus leaped on stage and strode to the microphone. Black Venus visibly beamed when opening the show, ready to share their experiences as a queer black person. Yet, their initial charisma soon wore off. They paused between recitations of their poetry to plug their website and social media handles, as well as old uninventive jokes in an attempt to connect with the audience. Their performance tried too hard to impress. Though the ideas still kept their overall strength, Black Venus’ distracting jokes detracted from the poetry’s impact.
Continuing the show’s introduction, poet Justice Ameer entered the stage and joked with the audience. Her poetry focused on her experience as a black trans woman. As she performed, she did not seem to use the rhythm or speed of her speech to influence her presentation. She began to lose credibility when she mocked the notion that humans believe themselves responsible for climate change. The concepts behind her work—though honorable—blatantly opposed scientific fact and distracted from her account of living as a queer person. After messing up the opening line to her final poem, she jokingly stepped back, saying “I’m gonna start this again.” When she did begin, it was in a completely different voice that made the poem feel acted and planned, rather than authentic. Disregarding this slip-up, she managed to establish a poignant, powerful, and introspective persona throughout.
The final opening act was by Chrysanthemum Tran, a queer and transgender Vietnamese American, who somehow managed to interweave sweat jokes with stories of gritty experiences. Tran’s performance was solid, her deep voice balanced with a rhythm and direction which more than made up for the lack thereof in the previous performances. After a few short poems, Tran invited Ameer back on stage to present a final piece. The two spoke in unison, finished each other’s sentences, and matched each other’s hand motions in perfect synchronization. Though these pieces were each executed with admirable technical accuracy, they seemed rather purposeless. The unison speech created a  haunting feeling that seemed slapped on, as it did not complement the verses well. Altogether, the remaining effects simply added a new spin, which did little to enhance the meaning behind the poems themselves. However, overall, Tran and Ameer’s individual performances completed each other both technically and emotionally, which lead to a generally satisfying performance.
After over an hour of introductory material and intermission, the stage lit up as Kit Yan spun around, mischievously smiled, and launched into his monologue. Yan flowed through story after story, pausing long enough to let his words make an impact, beginning with his childhood. As he spoke, he seemed to be rediscovering his own stories. Yan never resorted to yelling out his ideas, nor did he attempt to convince the audience that his point of view was necessarily right. He simply told his story and let the audience listen.
During his performance, he made several physical convulsions as he spoke. Whenever he reacted, it seemed as though he were truly experiencing moments of his life all over again. The words poured out both audibly and physically. By his incredibly visceral performance, one would not be able to guess that he had performed this routine countless times before.
Though he often interlaced his stories with light-hearted comedy, Yan also reached into darker depths. Recalling his father’s death, he began to physically choke in order to act out his father’s last moments. By reliving the scene himself, he brought to the stage an unparalleled power.
Yan created an environment on the stage where he was merely an intermediary for the audience to experience the life of an Asian-American, queer man. He did not merely perform or present poems—he brought the depths of his life, his heart, and his emotions to life.
Yan’s recitations singlehandedly rescued a show that otherwise lacked a significant display of artistic performance. His deep connection with the words he spoke resonated throughout the venue and in his audience’s hearts.

Chandler Klang Smith’s first published novel, “The Sky is Yours,” defies description. Striding confidently across genres—post-apocalyptic thriller, science-fictional critique of a consumerist zeitgeist, spiritual musing—Smith has crafted a singular piece of fiction. The author switches between points of view to expand the world and advance the narrative, which provide the reader glimpses of the past as the future unfolds before them. Time is almost a character in this story, a presence unseen but always felt. Set in what seems to be New York City several hundred years in the future, “The Sky is Yours” does not follow the traditional narrative arc expected of its ilk. Beginning in typical science fiction style, the story quickly expands into other forms, evolving into a chimaera of genre. The greatest difference between “The Sky is Yours” and other books which attempt to tackle the same topics—consumerism, coming-of-age, and the ugliness of the human experience—is in its ultimate focus. Though the narration follows an array of interesting and complicated characters—some more sympathetic than others—the underlying story is clearly that of the city itself.
The focus on the city is well-deserved. Ravaged by the excesses of late capitalism and the two beasts which circle above it—constantly setting fires to a city which long ago exhausted its capacity to fight them—the city seems to be a lumbering dinosaur crumpling under its own weight. The middle class has been hewn out by both of these forces, leaving only the incredibly wealthy and the destitute. Both mad in their own way, these communities inevitably clash. Everything in the story emphasizes the age of the city, like the city-block sized homes of the upper-upper class built up to mythical proportions. Every word hums with the weight of time. The origins of the city as a simple grouping of people have been lost, as the city takes on its own identity. There is a distinct sense that the characters whose adventure unfolds over the pages of the novel are utterly insignificant outside their relationship to the built environment in which they exist. It is a humbling thing.
The conflict between the two remaining socioeconomic groups disturbs the two main characters’ comfortable lives. There’s reality star Duncan Humphrey Ripple V, the scion of the metropolis’ last dynasty, a zillionaire teenager on the cusp of adulthood who’s been spoiled beyond repair. There is his bride-to-be, Baroness Swan Lenore Dahlberg, who suffers from a strange condition which causes her to keep growing teeth. This ailment is perhaps one of the novel’s many metaphoric nods towards the central critique of consumption and the gnawing, insatiable hunger of greed. Not everyone in this story lives in city-block sized mansions. Their comfortable lives of privilege and hedonism are disrupted by Abby—a feral girl who saves Duncan after he crash lands on her man-made island of garbage on which she has lived completely alone all her life—and Eisenhower Sharkey, a maker and purveyor of a psychedelic mixture of moss-like plants, drugs, and flavorings called “chaw.“ Sharkey’s ability to predict where the dragons will strike next gives him an almost mythical status among the denizens of Torchtown, a penal colony set up in the poor districts of the city before the dragons arrived.
Each character plays a role in the world Smith has crafted. Though they shift and grow over the course of the novel, their core inadequacies and flaws remain. It’s a refreshing, if somewhat unsettling, perspective on the strange mixture of flexibility and rigidity which characterizes the human spirit. These characters, at times, seem less like people than mythical figures, archetypes playing out some cosmic narrative, another entry in the history of the city. Singular and memorable, yet still utterly insignificant in the face of the concrete city, each character reminds the reader that something is deeply wrong in this imagined future.
The narrative, though at times difficult to follow, is a pleasure to read. Smith paints a highly detailed, if disturbing, caricature of a potential future with witty prose and impressive style. Time takes on an ephemeral quality, the incredible age of the city making years and decades seem to blend together and mix with the present. “The Sky is Yours” captures perfectly a sense of what it means to be young in a world which is incomprehensibly old. There is an ever-present wrongness to the city which is the result of a truly skillful wielding of storytelling technique and a carefully calculated flow which keeps the reader off-balance. This transforms the novel from narrative to experience.
It is in the mixing of things—of genre, of classes, of fantasy, and of gritty imagined-reality—that Smith’s work shines. It is not a particularly incredible post-apocalyptic narrative. It is not a great work of science fiction. It is not an amazing coming-of-age story. But it is a highly competent and enjoyable mixture of all of them and then some.

Since the Marvel Cinematic Universe began with “Iron Man” in 2008, the franchise has enjoyed an incredible run at the box office, amassing over $13.5 billion with 18 movies, and more in the works. Popular among fans and generally accepted by critics, Marvel has fared much better than its rival DC Comics, who have struggled to regain the spirit of “The Dark Knight” trilogy with the exception of last year’s release of “Wonder Woman.” Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” is widely thought to be the best comic book movie of all time, especially for Heath Ledger’s timeless performance as the Joker. How does “Black Panther” compare to the Gotham hero? Simply put, “Black Panther” is right up there with “The Dark Knight” as the best comic book film ever.
First introduced in “Captain America: Civil War,” Black Panther is the alter ego of T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the prince of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Beneath its third-world country guise, Wakanda is a highly advanced society supported by the strongest metal known to man, vibranium. The city mixes traditional African culture with gorgeous, high-tech architecture and style—it’s no wonder they hide themselves to preclude the risks of exploitation by the rest of the world.
Most single-hero comic book movies follow a similar style: origin story, some villain who vows to destroy the hero, a massive fight scene, and the resolution that ends in the hero’s triumph. “Black Panther” reinvents these plot points, recontextualizing them in a metaphor for black suppression. There are villains—Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) and Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) are both fantastic—but the real problem lies in the question of Wakanda’s responsibility to protect both Africans and black Americans around the world. It’s a problem that doesn’t have a clear solution at first, making the film a cathartic journey of not only protecting Wakanda from the threat of Killmonger, but a moral question of whether a highly advanced, black African nation should lend a hand in protecting black individuals outside of their home.
Boseman is clearly the leader of the cast, assuming the role of T’Challa with poise and strong, subtle power. Like all great leaders, his moral compass serves as guide to the rest of the characters. At the end of the film, Boseman, dressed all in black, stands against the fence of basketball court in Oakland. The shot composition makes him look larger than life—Boseman stands with complete confidence. His stance parallels the end of “The Dark Knight Rises” when Bruce Wayne donates his mansion to the orphans of Gotham. But while Wayne fades away, T’Challa remains present, a symbol of active heroism.
T’Challa is joined by his amusing sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) who makes his weapons, his love interest Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o), army general Okoye (Danai Gurira), best friend W’kabi (Daniel Kaluuya), and his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett). Each of these characters have significant roles and no one is shut out of the action. Nyong’o, Wright, and Gurira particularly stand out for their ability to combine laugh-out-loud humor with some amazing action sequences. Rounding out the cast are CIA agent Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman) and the elder Zuri (Forest Whitaker), who plays a very similar role here as he does in “Rogue One.”
“Black Panther” is able to succeed in large part due to Ryan Coogler being at the helm of the film. Coogler, writer and director of both “Fruitvale Station” and “Creed,” has solidified himself in Hollywood as an established filmmaker. His director of photography, Rachel Morrison, shines, displaying some incredible scenes of Wakandan landscape that are comparable to Peter Jackson’s shots of Middle Earth in “Lord of the Rings.” Morrison’s talent is well known—she recently became the first woman to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Cinematography for her work on “Mudbound.” Ludwig Göransson’s score emphasizes the more emotional parts of the movie while Kendrick Lamar’s studio-produced soundtrack is art in its own right, adding another powerful layer to “Black Panther.”
The only major problem with the film comes during its prime action scene near the end. The scene is necessary, but for a couple minutes the entire soul of the movie is lost. Superhero movies tend to showcase action scenes that seem too choreographed: Everything is shot a little too well and the timing is a little too perfect. Toward its finale, “Black Panther” falls into this trope. At one point a crash of rhinos rise from the ground, a confusing moment that may cause eyes to roll. While on the whole the scene is cliché, a few memorable moments borrow iconic imagery from other big action movies. Martin Freeman’s CIA Agent flies in a “Star Wars”-like ship above the planet, gunning down enemy transports, while T’Challa and Killmonger fight on a bridge above a deep abyss, reminiscent of epic lightsaber duels. The film jumps back to life with intense screenwriting, when Killmonger exclaims to T’Challa, “Bury me in the ocean with my ancestors who jumped from ships, because they knew death was better than bondage.”
“Black Panther,” like “Wonder Woman,” is long overdue in terms of minority representation in superhero movies. The film, like last year’s “Get Out,” challenges the old, white Hollywood that has dominated the film business for far too long. Moreover, “Black Panther” does it superbly, bringing together an incredible ensemble of black entertainers who come together to make one of the best comic book movies of all time.

On Feb. 16, the Handel and Haydn Society performed all six of Johann Sebastian Bach's “Brandenburg Concertos” at Memorial Hall's Sanders Theater. Founded in Boston in 1815, the orchestra brought an incredibly charismatic and artistic performance to the stage, while maintaining respect for the source material.
The small group was composed of string, wind, brass, and percussion instruments. They began with Bach’s “Brandenburg Concerto No. 1 in F Major,” projecting their warm and rich sound across the hall effortlessly and drawing the audience in with each sweep of the bow. The sound brought listeners to a different time. Recreating the intimacy of a Baroque era concert in a venue as large as Sanders Theater was a challenge that the group met with impressive ease.For their next number, “Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 in D Major,” the group rearranged to feature flutist. Christopher Krueger, violinist Aisslinn Nosky, and harpsichord player Ian Watson. The trio was also supported by a small string ensemble. Despite the eclectic mix of instruments, the trio performed smoothly as a single unit of sound. Each artistic intent was perfectly matched. The string ensemble that supported the trio also accompanied them energetically, buoying the soloists up with their own lines. During many of the performances, the violinists stood on opposite sides of the stage while the rest of the orchestra remained in the center such that the violins resembled two arms of a single human body. This arrangement helped to distinguish the different parts and made their melodies and harmonies much clearer. When they played in unison, the orchestra united even the most diverging parts.In the third concerto, Aisslinn Nosky’s performance shone with her vitality and musicianship. Leading the group, Nosky fiddled along with dance-like movements, all the while playing with incredible sophistication. She grinned at both the ensemble and the audience as she played. Her charisma was infectious, pulling the audience in further as her notes continued to bounce off every inch of the hall. As the melody passed to different instruments, Nosky danced out of the way, giving the spotlight to others. The members of the group listened to each other with sensitivity, discerning individual voices. They also manipulated their tones to give each line a purpose: Long held bass notes in the background were active and deliberate, drawn from the string to bolster the melodic line floating above. During “Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major,” trumpet player John Thiessen’s solo transcended the orchestra, sounding more like an oboe than a trumpet.  An anguished cry left a haunting feeling pervading across the concert hall as an oboe-like piercing tone replaced the hearty, typical sound of a brass instrument. This voice was surprising but ultimately pleasing.
Nosky’s virtuosic violin solo highlighted the first movement of “Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 in B-flat Major.” She brought robust and powerful emotion to the score. Again, the performance emulated the atmosphere of an intimate house concert rather than a massive hall. The transition from phrase to phrase invited the audience along in the story that the players wove. The group reserved Bach’s “Brandenburg Concerto No. 4 in G Major” for the final performance of the night. An ethereal recorder solo established a mournful atmosphere. When the orchestra whirled directly from the “Andante” to the “Presto” sections of the piece, the group provided yet another captivating performance. The duet between violin and recorder leaped in every direction possible, the duo performing with ease and excitement. Though the pair played together as a single entity, they stressed the differences in sound between their instruments, a decision that came as unusually delightful.
More than 200 years after its creation, the Handel and Haydn Society continues to breathe life into its Baroque and classical repertoire. Their mesmerizing rendition of Bach's “Brandenburg Concertos” brought a depth and excitement to the stage that is not easily replicated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Modern China is to the American right what modern France is to American left—a fantasy. The love is gilded in the politically-correct hatred, fear, and targeting of China, as Stephen K. Bannon characterized the country in Michael Wolff’s “Fire and Fury” as “the real enemy,” its people as “the most rational people in the world, until they’re not,” and its government as having “taken total advantage of [the United States].” And I say this appearance is love because rhetoric on China is by nature defeatist—China seems both too old and too big to fail. To target China, as Bannon does, is to target nothing, as the country counters all expectations, holding an economy that thrives inexplicably on investment over innovation—a model of growth Trump would wish was applicable to the United States. There is no wall to build. China is where the second Eiffel tower resides without consent of the original. An ethnostate so insular Google has its own knockoff. The home of a president and a billion countrymen who embrace traditionalism as a brother. While Bannon wanted to evolve former President Barack Obama’s “pivot to Asia” to cultural, trade, and diplomatic war, Trump recently announced tariffs on Chinese solar panels, predicted to significantly increase the cost of going green. American liberals mourn the loss of our country; news outlets tentatively crown China as our inevitable successor. We seem unable to hurt China without hurting ourselves.
But, as reflected in most intersections of policy and culture, an awkward dichotomy exists: Despite political friction, the connection between China and the American right has never been more public. China grows as the United States halts, representing both threat and opportunity for escapism. The New York Times published a widely-cited op-ed entitled “The Alt-Right’s Asian Fetish”, reconciling apparent contradiction between the racist ideology and Asian girlfriends of many major alt-right figures with an excessive buy-in to racial stereotypes, such as the model minority and exotification. In response to the NYT piece, other Asian-American writers stated that Lim’s analysis was incomplete, conveniently leaving out women’s agency. The truth, they argued, citing interviews with major alt-right figures including Vietnamese-American Tila Tequila, was more sinister—Asian countries represented the ethnostate and isolationism alt-righters desired for America. Its women were seen as products of seeming utopias, which was, for the women, a relief from the left’s characterization as political novices. The Atlantic cited a forum user in an article entitled “Why China Loves Trump,” who stated that today’s Democratic Party reminded him of the Cultural Revolution. Chinese opinion exists outside the realm of American respectability, as Trumpism—in strange but convincing logics—is equated to communism and Trump’s billionaire status is seen as commonplace. All of which works to place Asian-Americans, of whom 79 percent voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, in an awkward position. The irony asserts itself here: Very few administrations have centered on anti-China rhetoric the way Trump’s has, and very few electorates have loved Asia so much.
As the American child of Chinese immigrants, I have never loved China. There was simply no incentive to do so. On a local level, China seemed “uncool.” I had never used, or wished to use, my Chineseness as a form of social capital. On a larger level, my parents stayed in America to leave China. I was too close to a large something to claim to know, let alone love, it. On an even larger level, America’s categorization of China was always grotesque, both too neoconservative and neoliberal, too communist and capitalist, too different and radically boring. American messaging about China was in contention. The results: inconclusive. Conversations on China veered too existentially because China challenged the myth of our exceptionalism through its exoticism, communism, and radicalism. The parents on TV watched TV, ate turkey, and did drugs with college friends; my parents survived the Tiananmen Square massacre.
The current categorization of China by figures of the American right as economically parasitic and Asia as socially ideal is a continuation of America’s ambivalence, though both extremes are enlarged. Perspectives on China’s potential rise to power is, instead, a litmus test on how should America be, especially because China’s growth may be simply its process of development, an application of declining marginal productivity. Economist Paul R. Krugman stated Chinese people consume too little to maintain economic health; vice chairman of Citigroup Peter R. Orszag stated that China may be near its Lewis point, at the brink of significant economic challenges. China’s soft power is weak; few countries run to its aid when it is not armed with an economic bat.
Bannon’s rhetoric may perhaps best be seen as strategic play. By targeting an enemy as large as China with threats as grand as economic warfare, he appeals to Trump’s hawkish electorate without consigning himself to action, perhaps knowing full well the fallibility of his plan. The puzzle is less interesting for the alt-right that Bannon himself calls “losers”; its praise of Asia is simple investment in the incorrect view of homogeneity as success.
China best represents to the American right both its dream and its apocalypse. Asia is, of course, growing, but its growth is not threatening by nature. Freud’s death instinct is perhaps the best explanation of the right’s insistence on China’s growth as an important future factor in America’s demise. By articulating its death, the collective finds its drive to survive.

Students trickle into the Barker Center Café for their latté of choice and a “Fern’s Problem Solver” sandwich. With its eclectic wood furniture and warm lighting, the space promises the most bang for your BoardPlus (in terms of ambiance). Every English concentrator you know raves about it. Daily.
Despite its current art-centric programming and beatnik spirit, the Barker Center for the Humanities’ ornate fireplaces and elaborate antler chandelier provide a glimpse at its storied past. This saga began when the Barker Center was not the humanities mecca it is today, but rather the Harvard Union—a new social club on campus.
“Never in all its history, it is said, have Harvard men been united as they are at the present time,” reads a 1902 New York Times article. The Harvard Union, barely two years into its existence, seemed well on its way to cure the social ills that formed the impetus for its conception as a clubhouse where all Harvard men, regardless of social class, could meet “on equal footing.” Featuring smoke-filled dining and common spaces, a library, and a billiards room (with the option of professional coaching), the Quincy Street clubhouse was open to all Harvard students for a $10 yearly membership fee.
In 1895, writing for The Harvard Graduates’ Magazine, historian W.R. Thayer ’81 first proposed the construction of a university club based on models at Cambridge and Oxford. Thayer cited the growing student population of the University as the cause of a social shift in 1877 during which “‘Society’ and ‘non-society’ men were pitted against each other” in a series of student elections. This discontent extended to the growing number of men, excluded from final clubs and other elite groups, who formed a myriad of smaller social organizations.  Thayer believed these groups, including the mysteriously named “Mermaid” literary club, threatened overall unity.
One writer for The Harvard Advocate in 1895 penned an article calling for an improved dining establishment but doubting the Union’s potential as a social club, claiming that “There are too many social clubs at Harvard already and the greater part of them tend directly to develop snobbishness and exclusiveness,” he wrote.
After considerable debate, Thayer’s vision for The Union came to fruition with a $150,000 donation from Major Henry L. Higginson, the founder of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Higginson proclaimed his egalitarian hope to create a club where “pride for wealth, pride of poverty, and pride of class would find no place.” As reported in The Crimson, the Union building was constructed equidistant from the elite “Gold Coast” student dorms and those in the yard.
Quoted in the Boston Herald at the announcement of the Union, Governor Roger Wolcott “emphasized the effect which such association would have in the breaking down of prejudice and obliteration of animosity.”
The University and Higginson’s attempts at “social reform through architecture” proved a fraught experiment in the early 20th century as membership in the Union began to decline while Harvard final clubs maintained social dominance. The building, though, also provided space for student extracurricular clubs. Its basement housed the offices of The Crimson, then led by FDR, despite concerns over the “editorial integrity” of the space and potential for conflict of interest.
The establishment of the University’s housing system in the 1930s, a precursor to today’s setup, dealt the final blow to the Union, after which Harvard converted the space into a freshman activity and dining center. The building that Henry James had referred to as a “great, grave, noble hall,” became a center of freshman debauchery. As reported in Harvard Magazine, underclassmen threw butter at the ceiling chandelier (narrowly missing an antler ceiling chandelier, a rumored gift from Teddy Roosevelt) to see if it would stick.
With its new freshmen focus, the Union building became a social hub in its own right featuring banquets, lecture series, dances, and the publication of the now-defunct freshman magazine, The Yardling.
According to meeting minutes from the late 1950s, Freshman Union topics of discussion including “beer throwing” at the annual “Smoker” dinner, warranting the committees’ recommendation that “[...] the supply of beer either be cut down comparably or be cut off earlier when things start looking explosive.” Other contentious discussions included whether or not “Bermuda” shorts would be permitted in the space.
After a $23-million-dollar renovation in 1996 and the designation of Annenberg as the freshman dining hall, The Union became the Barker Center for the Humanities. As reported by Harvard Magazine, debate over the building’s use reignited after the formation of the Committee to Save the Great Hall of the Freshman Union. A member of the group, H.A. Crosby Forbes ’50, decried the renovation and considered it “an act comparable to homicide.”
While the space never became the democratic social center that its founders envisioned—and exclusivity in social life remains a point of campus discussion—the Barker Center has carved out its own distinctive space at Harvard. The Barker Café dabbled once again with egalitarianism with a free coffee program, brought to an abrupt end in 2009. Perhaps with BGLTQ open mic events in the Café and its commitment to providing a space conducive to artistic expression, the Barker Center of today promotes an ideal of inclusivity that goes beyond that of its predecessors.
“Yea, this is the House of Fellowship/Binder of bonds that ne’er shall slip,” read Charles Warren, class of 1889, at the dedication of the space in 1901. “Symbol of Harvard Loyal, House of Good Fellowship—Welcome to thee!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team was able to clinch a spot in the second annual Ivy League Tournament by topping Yale, 64-49, on Saturday night in a nationally televised game at Lavietes Pavilion. The win was the fifth straight for the Crimson and allowed it to keep pace Penn—its opponent next next Saturday night in Philadelphia—for the top spot in the conference.
Much like in its last battle with the Bulldogs, Harvard (14-11, 9-1 Ivy League) came out fast and rode a strong first half to victory. However, unlike in the first meeting, Yale (12-14, 5-5) was never able to get within striking distance after the break. The guests trimmed their halftime deficit from 20 to 9 but the Crimson had enough answers on the offensive end to keep the 1,636 fans in attendance at relative ease.
Four Harvard players were in double figures and the team shot a blistering 46.3 percent from the field, its third-highest mark in a home game this season. Meanwhile, the Bulldogs, which entered the contest leading the Ivy League in field goal percentage, scored just 49 points to mark their fewest in a game this year.
STARTING FAST, TAKE TWO
In the teams’ first meeting, Harvard came out of the starting blocks on fire. For a club that was struggling mightily on the offensive end at the time, the opening half against Yale was arguably the best basketball that the Crimson had played up to that point in the season. Harvard made 11 of its first 18 field goals that night and junior guard Corey Johnson was outscoring the Bulldogs on his own for much of the first half.
For as dominant as it looked in New Haven three weekends ago, the Crimson outdid itself on Saturday night. Sophomore forward Chris Lewis started the scoring party by scoring the first eight points for Harvard and 10 of its first 14—the sophomore was already in double-figures just 6:10 into the contest.
“I think we’re all at our best when we’re playing base, with our defense initiating our offense getting down the court,” sophomore guard Christian Juzang said. “Lew did a great job of spreading the lane, opening it up for wings, wings did the same thing opening it up for Lew and when we get into that transition defense into our secondary offense, it flows really nice and rhythm shots come out of it.”
However, it was after Lewis recorded his tenth point that the Crimson’s runaway train departed the station. The hosts went on a 17-0 run over the next eight-plus minutes to put the game largely out of reach before it arrived at its midpoint. It was difficult to tell during the stretch whether it was the Harvard offense or its defense that was more dominant since the two ends of the floor played so seamlessly into one another during the run.
“It’s not all just one-sided it is how you get there,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We were energized and playing pretty well. We were in a good rhythm and had momentum and they didn’t. Sometimes that can snowball in the opposite direction for them. You can miss shots and now we are defending and energized even more where we are getting stops and run-outs to play offense on the other end.”
All told, the Crimson went 7-of-12 from the field over the span while also forcing misses on all eight of Yale’s field goal attempts and causing four turnovers.
WHO NEEDS THE THREES?
Perhaps what was most impressive on the offensive end during the 17-0 run was the ball movement from Harvard, which led to easy baskets possession after possession. Of the 17 points scored during the stretch, the Crimson only attempted two three-point field goals (making one) but 12 points came in the paint off of layups and dunks, and two were via the free throw line.
After living and dying by the three earlier in conference play—Harvard averaged 25.3 three-point attempts in its first six Ancient Eight games—the Crimson has been more successful in recent games at getting easier baskets by playing through Lewis and its frontcourt. Harvard has averaged just 16.75 three-pointers per game over its last four contests, which has resulted in a two-point field goal percentage of 49 percent in those games.
“We want to have great balance,” Amaker said. “That’s the key for our team. We talk a lot about bench and balance. Our bench was tremendous. We never want to be one-dimensional offensively. We wanted people to maybe react to how we are playing and then we feel like if that is how they are doing this, we have the other portions of our offensive game to kick in.”
Opposing coaches have employed different strategies on how to guard Lewis. Penn coach Steve Donahue refused to double-team the Harvard sophomore and paid for it as Lewis posted a career-high 25 points in a nine-point Crimson win. Yale head man James Jones opted for the same tactic in the first half and was rewarded by watching his team allow 24 points in the paint.
“We got in in there, and Chris delivered,” Amaker said. “That changes things, when you are trying to guard a big guy like that, what are you going to do. Do you play off on other guys? Do you double down? He caused them to change some things. That’s hopefully what we can do to different teams by having a tremendous post up player like Chris Lewis.”
Once Yale began doubling down in the paint, Harvard’s field goal percentage dropped—it shot just 38.5 percent in the second half—but the Crimson was still able to corral five offensive rebounds and keep the Bulldogs at arm’s length despite not shooting the lights out. Perhaps the only way to slow down Lewis and Harvard is by getting the big man into foul trouble on the other end.
