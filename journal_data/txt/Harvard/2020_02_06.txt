After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Move over, “Infinity War.” The century’s new most ambitious crossover just came to town. You might even say it arrived on the old town road.
That’s right! During one of Super Bowl LIV’s many commercial breaks, Lil Nas X’s irreverent, genre-defying, chart-topping hit made an unforgettable appearance in an advertisement for, of all things, Doritos. Of course, it was a completely historically accurate rendering of Western saloon fare. The chip manufacturer, all too eager to emphasize its longstanding ties to the Wild West, titled the clip “The Cool Ranch.”
The minute-long video features Lil Nas X and actor Sam Elliott, with cowboy boots and wide-brimmed hats that put Woody from “Toy Story” to shame, in an outrageously exaggerated dance-off. The prize, both to everyone’s and no one’s surprise, is a bag of Cool Ranch Doritos, its cobalt blue packaging a striking splash of color in the endless desert.
If suddenly hearing last summer’s unofficial anthem in the midst of winter wasn’t enough of a shock, viewers can also witness Elliott’s distinctive mustache ripple in (mildly threatening) anticipation as the song begins to play.
After several exchanges of increasingly elaborate footwork, Elliott concedes defeat with a tip of his hat as Lil Nas X emerges the victor of the Herculean struggle. He rides off into the desert, bag of Cool Ranch Doritos in hand: literally savoring his victory.
In a seeming violation of the scientific laws governing the creation of matter, another bright blue bag of Doritos remains where the first had stood before Lil Nas X claimed it as his prize. This crossover won’t let something as trivial and mundane as physics get in its way.
Just as the saga appears to reach its end, a third character enters the suspense-riddled scene: Billy Ray Cyrus. As he leisurely strums a guitar, he leaves the audience with three fateful words, spoken with incredible conviction: “I ain’t dancin’.”

Facebook, Twitter, and My Chemical Romance have one thing in common: They all got their big break in 2006. The resemblance stops there, though. While the years — no, decades — to come will surely see the ascendancy of plenty more apps with minimalist logos in various shades of blue, will they ever witness the singular cultural phenomenon of MCR’s rock opera “The Black Parade”? Will any artist ever manage to replicate the unlikely but timeless appeal of five men in marching band uniforms singing about death?
Obviously not. It’s no wonder, then, that the band’s 2013 breakup devastated fans — many of whom, doubtless, shelved their industrial quantities of black eyeliner and left “The Black Parade” for dead. But the most faithful held out hope, waiting patiently for their heroes’ inevitable return.
Of course it was inevitable. Who would expect any less from a band that named their farewell compilation album “May Death Never Stop You”? True to their word, MCR announced their first U.S. tour in over nine years on Jan. 29. Frontman Gerard Way and his bandmates are back from the barren grave of their seven-year hiatus, and they’re here to stay — at least until Oct. 11, the tour’s last stop in Las Vegas.
Tickets went on sale to the general public on Jan. 31 at noon. As you watch them trickle into the hands (claws? pincers?) of lightning-fast resale robots, enjoy this selection of tunes from the album that redefined glam-rock glory: “The Black Parade.”
“The End.”
Set to the ominously slowing beat of a heart rate monitor, the opener to “The Black Parade” establishes the album’s macabre tone by packing enough chilling existentialism to rival the best of Sartre.
“Welcome to the Black Parade”
Featuring the haunting piano intro that stole the hearts of music critics, Tumblr girls, and just about everyone in between, this ambitious rock anthem encompasses all of the album’s surreal, morbid allure in five unforgettable minutes.
“I Don’t Love You”
Relentlessly cynical and melancholy, this track destroys just about every romance trope in the book, making it instantly relatable to anyone whose love life is less than perfect.
“Cancer”
This piano ballad is nothing short of a lyrical masterpiece, heartbreaking in its stark fragility. When Gerard Way sings the line “’Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you,” an ordinary V-I cadence transforms into a moment of extraordinary tenderness and catharsis.
“Famous Last Words”
In the face of track after track about death and dying, the album’s conclusion is a forceful affirmation of life and resilience. Take the first lines of the chorus as proof: “I am not afraid to keep on living / I am not afraid to walk this world alone.”

Reflecting on the greatest comedy films of the last decade reminds us why we go to the cinema in the first place. We go to feel, to be moved, and perhaps that’s what makes comedies special: Audiences not only forget their problems with laughs but, while they are suspended in an illusory state, filmmakers may tackle poignant, often difficult, themes in a more palatable manner. The 2010s were rife with witty political satires and haunting black comedies — here are the very best of them.
(See: Part 1: Science Fiction, Part 2: Fantasy, and Part 3: Superheroes)
Honorable Mention: “The Disaster Artist” (2017), dir. James Franco
“I did not hit her, it’s not true! It’s bullshit, I did not hit her! I did not! Oh, hi Mark!”
10. “Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” (2019), dir. Quentin Tarantino
“Once Upon a Time… In Hollywood” brings 60’s tinseltown fare to life with magnetic production design and unexpectedly restrained direction from Tarantino. The film features much of the acclaimed writer-director’s trademark style: He coaxes powerful performances from his actors, produces a killer finale that indulges in so much comedic violence it will send your ribs packed home in a take-out box, and, once again, douses his film with shots of women’s feet.
9. “Lady Bird” (2017), dir. Greta Gerwig
Greta Gerwig is a master of words, and her screenplay for “Lady Bird” proves as much — she has the ability to package dialogue in ways that preserve spontaneity. It’s a beautifully acted, irresistibly earnest, and moving depiction of a mother-daughter relationship. For her directorial efforts, Gerwig also became just the fifth female director to be recognized for a nomination at the Academy Awards.
8. “The Favourite” (2018), dir. Yorgos Lanthamos
Quirky, imaginative, and incredibly unique, Lanthamos’ “The Favourite” is a period piece like never seen or done before. With stunning production design, costumes, and innovative cinematography (achieved through distorted lenses), “The Favourite” is founded in beautiful production values, but it also features razor sharp wit, over-the-top characters, and impeccable timing. Lanthamos’ film uses black comedy to get audiences on board with an under-represented period in history and an unpredictable parable of power.
7. “Jojo Rabbit” (2019), dir. Taika Waititi
Ever wondered what World War II would look like through the eyes of a 10 year old Nazi fanatic with Adolf Hitler as an imaginary best friend? Or how a movie preaching tolerance and dealing with death, growing up, and unfair circumstances is handled by the director of the bombastic “Thor: Ragnarok”? Surprisingly, “Jojo Rabbit” manages to swing for all the risks and hit the mark. It’s somber, heartfelt, boasts an intimate score, and, most importantly, uses the ridiculous scenarios in the film to frame extremely effective comedy.
6. “The Death of Stalin” (2017) dir. Armando Iannuci
Laughable incompetence and unashamedly lobbying for political favoritism are front and center in Iannuci’s absurdist Soviet Union satire, “The Death of Stalin.” Iannuci’s film is gifted with a witty screenplay and pitch-perfect casting, which headlines Steve Buscemi as the bubbly Nikita Khrushchev, Simon Russel Beale as the manipulative Lavrentiy Beria, and Jeffrey Tambor as the mumbling Georgy Malenkov.
5. “The Big Short” (2015), dir. Adam McKay
McKay’s foray into more serious comedy after previously helming “Anchorman” and “Talladega Nights” was exactly what the writer-director needed. From characters routinely breaking the fourth wall to celebrity cameos explaining technical financial terms to blindingly fast editing that reels audiences in hook line and sinker, “The Big Short” is a comedy that feels effortlessly entertaining. Add to it an all-star cast, a powerful conclusion, and a poignant meditation on timely themes, and McKay’s comedy lingers long after the laughs subside.
4. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” (2014), dir. Wes Anderson
One should know what to expect from a Wes Anderson film at this point: deadpan humor, saturated colors, and lots of symmetry. But all those tropes line up perfectly in “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” a crime-comedy about a hotel concierge and his bell-boy protégé on a desperate quest to prove the concierge’s innocence when he's accused of murder. It might not wield the intelligent introspection on the level of some picks on this list, but “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is exactly what it sets out to be — sublime and fantastical Wes Anderson entertainment.
3. “Birdman” (2014), dir. Alejandro González Iñárritu
Before Sam Mendes made one-take films cool in 2019, Alejandro González Iñárritu made them cool in 2014 with “Birdman.” “Birdman” is so uncannily referential to the life of its central star, Michael Keaton, it could have easily been a biopic — an actor decides to risk it all to be re-embraced into the art world after making a name for himself in superhero films. It also stars Edward Norton in a supporting role as an actor so in love with his own artistic sensibilities he pulls a coup d'état (essentially Edward Norton). “Birdman” is beautifully shot and edited, backed by a rhythmic hypnotic score, and stuffed full of satirical black comedy.
2. “The Wolf of Wall Street” (2013), dir. Martin Scorsese
Excessive itself at 180 minutes, “The Wolf of Wall Street” is a film about excess, plunging into the vices of greed and avarice afoot in the world’s financial capital. “The Wolf of Wall Street” finds director Martin Scorsese revisiting familiar themes, but this time to surprisingly comedic effect. Terence Winter’s screenplay, adapted from the memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort, can easily be branded as a “Goodfellas” wannabe, but “The Wolf of Wall Street” redeems itself as so much more through its comedy, which transpires naturally from the ludicrous scenarios on Wall Street. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are excellent together on screen, both screaming their way to Academy Award nominations.
1. “Parasite” (2019), dir. Bong Joon-ho
Tying together political satire, thriller, and social commentary — sometimes all at once — “Parasite” is unpredictable, captivating, and the epitome of what storytelling should mean and what cinema should strive to be. Bong Joon-ho is in complete control in this beautifully edited, streamlined masterpiece of a film that uses clever production design, an incredible ensemble cast, and a screenplay that just keeps you guessing. The beauty of “Parasite” lies in how it uses all its crafts to leave audiences feeling vulnerable, and it’s in that vulnerability that Bong Joon-ho lands his killer message.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a January 24 ruling, a Middlesex Superior Court judge lifted Cambridge’s two-year moratorium on certain cannabis sales permits. The moratorium, passed by the Cambridge City Council in September 2019, gave historically marginalized groups — including women, minorities, and those who have been impacted by the war on drugs — a two-year window to be the sole operators of recreational marijuana shops in the city.
Though the moratorium was creative and well-intentioned, it was a complete failure in reality. Not only was it unconstitutional as argued by the judge, but it was also based on economic fallacies and misconceptions of the cannabis market. The Cambridge City Council showed either apathy or ignorance for standard economic theory when crafting the policy. The resulting moratorium helped no marginalized groups and effectively banned the sale of recreational cannabis in Cambridge.
Despite its short-lived nature, the deficiencies of the moratorium are indisputable. Not one recreational marijuana dispensary is open in Cambridge even though 71.3 percent of Cambridge voters supported full marijuana legalization during the 2016 Massachusetts referendum. The moratorium added restrictions on permits — stunting supply in an already over-regulated sector. In other towns, many medical marijuana dispensaries applied for and received permits to sell recreationally. The moratorium prevented Cambridge’s existing medical marijuana dispensaries from pursuing this natural transition. As a result, Cambridge has no recreational dispensaries while weed shops have popped up in surrounding Massachusetts towns.
Though the moratorium effectively constituted a ban on cannabis sales in Cambridge, the intentions of the policymakers were noble. The City Council was trying to address serious issues in the legal cannabis market. White, upper-class entrepreneurs dominate the market in many states. Black people, who suffered disproportionately as a result of the war on drugs, have not reaped the benefits of legalization. Only 1 percent of dispensaries nationwide are owned by black people.
The moratorium righteously attempted to help the victims of the war on drugs reap the benefits of legalization. So, why haven’t minorities utilized the head start?
While the moratorium effectively prevented white males from joining the market, it did not address the underlying issues that have kept minorities out of the legal cannabis industry. Federal banking regulations prevent many cannabis enterprises from receiving loans and opening bank accounts. As a result, it is very difficult to open a weed dispensary without significant liquid capital, which most aspiring small business owners, especially minorities, do not possess. Members of minority groups in Cambridge most likely had difficulty financing their recreational marijuana companies and, as a result, could not benefit from the banishment of competition.
Essentially, the moratorium did not address the fundamental issues of access to capital that have prevented low- and middle-income Americans from accessing the market. Competition was not the fundamental problem in the market, so its absence did not help aspiring small business owners. Though the moratorium did not directly hurt aspiring minority business owners, it did hurt owners of medical marijuana dispensaries and Cambridge consumers.
So, the moratorium failed. Now, what can be done to help both Cambridge’s consumers and historically marginalized groups?
The first necessary step is the deregulation of the cannabis market. Ideally, the striking down of the moratorium should allow for an influx in competition. However, city officials such as Quinton Zondervan have indicated support to appeal the ruling and use other options to “get in the way” of existing medical marijuana dispensaries seeking permits to sell recreationally. These efforts to further delay the implementation of recreational cannabis sales must be strongly resisted. Four years after its popular legalization, cannabis should finally be sold recreationally in Cambridge.
But, what about the historically marginalized people that will likely be left in this free-market framework? The moratorium failed because it did not address the underlying financial barriers preventing middle-class minorities from entering the legal marijuana market. New policies providing tax breaks, subsidies, and access to low-interest loans would alleviate many financial impediments without creating massive market distortions.
Minorities do not need a head start to enter the cannabis market. In fact, structural issues prevent the historically marginalized from capitalizing on head starts. Policymakers should focus on providing owners of weed shops access to loans and the banking system. Allaying the obstructions of banking regulations is the only way to change an industry that has essentially become a white, upper-class marijuana hegemony.
The Cambridge City Council should continue to propose creative policy solutions to complex social issues. However, they should also ensure that future proposals are effective and viable. In this case, the City Council must do a closer analysis of the economic complexities of the cannabis industry to create a policy that gives Cantabrigians access to safe, legal marijuana and grants historically marginalized people the opportunity to open their own profitable businesses.

CommonWealth Kitchen, a Dorchester nonprofit, is bringing local food businesses into Harvard kitchens. The nonprofit rents out kitchen space to local food start-ups, many of which are minority-owned, and then connects them with large operations in need of food — including hospitals, offices, and, universities.
Last summer, Harvard and other local universities partnered with CommonWealth to purchase products from these start-ups. Though it is more expensive for the University to buy food products from these small vendors as opposed to large wholesalers, the appeal of local food seems to outweigh this cost.
We appreciate the positive effects of Harvard’s initiative to support local vendors and give back to the surrounding community. Given its large wealth and influence, as well as its sometimes pernicious effects on the surrounding neighborhoods, we have repeatedly asked that Harvard give back more to the greater Cambridge and Boston community. Sourcing food from these local businesses is an important method of support, and we are also happy to see the increased diversity in food options that the deal seems poised to yield. As many of the small food startups in question are minority-owned and have culinary styles that might be unknown to a lot of students, we also hope that HUDS will display information on the origins of these local products, if possible.
But beyond these hopes, it is vitally important that Harvard itself absorb the extra cost associated with buying local food rather than passing it onto students. Tuition is already a serious strain on many students and their families, and in improving food options Harvard must not worsen this financial burden. Particularly for middle-income students not on financial aid who would bear the full weight of the cost increase, we are apprehensive about the effect of these new purchases.
Also, it is important that this outsourcing does not disadvantage existing HUDS workers. The last HUDS strike is still in recent memory, so we are very aware of their struggles. If the increased cost of local food procurement adversely affects HUDS workers, that offers another reason for caution. We believe that Harvard should absolutely expand the variety of food options and work with local businesses. But in doing so it cannot pass on the costs of that decision to students and employees.
In addition, as Harvard thinks about expanding food options in a way that takes into account a diversity of backgrounds, we also hope that it thinks about offering more inclusive meals for those with dietary restrictions — including vegan, vegetarian, Halal, and Kosher options, to name just a few — into the daily menu. Students with these restrictions deserve the same quality of food as everyone else, and we hope the University seizes on this newfound relationship with local food suppliers to ensure they get it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, as I was seeing Morocco with a few friends, we decided to get away from the coastal cities and visit the full interior of the country. Luckily, we found a driver online who was willing to take us. The deal? For several hundred U.S. dollars, he agreed to drive us more than 22 hours across three days, from the country’s coast to the southern border — and then back. The full drive traversed mountain ranges, limestone canyons, and the world’s largest non-polar desert. The terrain was insane; a one-way trip inland lasted roughly 12 hours, if you didn’t take too long for lunch.
In between naps and gazes out the window, I couldn’t help but think of the remarkable nature of this transaction. Here was a man we had never met before. Yet, he drove us — at times, more than 10 hours a day — across an entire country. He was a citizen who’d never been beyond his nation’s borders, and we were three college students from another continent. The one thing we knew we had in common? A single price upon which we agreed.
Smith famously wrote that “it is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.” As so many on campus and elsewhere castigate the free market, characterizing it as greedy and immoral, we would do well to remember Smith’s favorable view of transactions.
The word “transaction” unfortunately possesses a negative connotation. After all, Dean Khurana tells incoming freshman classes to strive for “transformative,” not “transactional” experiences in college. Certainly, friendships should not be transactional. But for many of the things that we have in our lives, a transaction was at work (and happily so). As you know already, such trades helped you to procure the phone you’re using, the clothes you’re wearing, the Ubers you ride in, and the food that you eat.
Smith’s great insight — which holds true today — is that when everybody is pursuing their own self-interest, the unintended consequence is that both people’s needs and desires are fulfilled. The market revolves around one defining mechanism: if there is profit to be made, sellers are willing to move mountains to make it.
Take the commonly cited — and controversial — example of prices after a hurricane. Let’s say that right as a storm rolls through, flooding hits many nearby grocery stores that sell paper towels. Because of the suddenly limited supply, remaining stores are able to charge much higher prices, so the cost of paper towels skyrockets from $1 to $25. At first glance, the act of profiting so handsomely from a disaster seems greedy and unjust. So why shouldn’t we establish a law to say that paper towel prices cannot rise in natural disasters?
Such controls were common in the 1970s under presidents Nixon through Carter; the price of gas was limited to an artificially low price by well-meaning politicians. But the results spoke for themselves. In this situation, if there were four individuals who needed gas, the one who got it was simply the first one to arrive at the station. Because the price was so low, the first person in line could fill up their entire tank, leaving no gas for the other three. Price controls encouraged overconsumption when supply was low. The lesson here is that naturally high prices serve the unintended purpose of encouraging lower consumption.
The same goes for the paper towels in our hurricane example. With a higher price, households now will likely buy only one paper towel roll instead of their usual four; in return, many more households are able to have a roll. This is a far more equitable distribution than if the first few people were able to buy all the paper towels, leaving everyone else with none.
In turn, paper towel sellers elsewhere naturally act like the market’s version of FEMA; as they see the higher prices in this area, they’ll ship more paper towels in, trying to capitalize. And the supply will keep on increasing until the price comes down to its normal level.
Let’s say instead the government tries to impose both a price and a quantity control: every household can only buy one roll, but at an affordable price. The problem? There is no extra profit to be made, and paper towel sellers from elsewhere don’t have the incentive to come in and provide more, leaving the supply low.
Lastly, if we're worried about the individuals in the area whose incomes are too low, the government should subsidize the individuals, so they can be guaranteed a $25 paper towel. But the answer should be to make markets more free, not to reduce their effectiveness; if the government puts a ceiling on the price, no matter how well-meaning it is, the poorest individuals cannot be guaranteed even one roll. Few would consider this more moral or fair than the market outcome.
It’s popular today to complain about capitalism, and the complaints undoubtedly are made with good intentions. But noble intentions here do not mean good consequences. There is an unintended beauty to free enterprise, and we’ve become so accustomed that we tend to ignore it. So we denounce the free markets, self-interest, and the business world. After all, it’s easy to tear something down. It’s much harder to remember exactly what is at stake of being lost.

The words, typewritten and lowercase, stare up from a wrinkled page. They seem purposefully crooked, and the whole collection of misaligned paragraphs is bordered by lines of blurry sheet music, followed by a tilted “table of contents.” It’s as if each component were cut out, arranged, and glued together, a personal scrapbook of drawings and prose — certainly not the conventional image of an acclaimed publication with thousands of printed copies and international reach.
But for the small booklet, both descriptions hold true. Cindy Crabb’s “Doris” series — an autobiographical feminist zine of the 1990s — was famous enough to be anthologized in paperback. Now, it’s also the pride and joy of the Harvard Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, a part of its 29-box zine collection.
Zines — short for “magazine” — are a type of publication often defined by being small-circulation, self-published, and inexpensive. They can center on cooking, bikes, menstruation, and anything in between. Many zines, including the ones in Schlesinger, are primarily by, about, and for women — possibly because the zine format typically lends itself to the kinds of self-expression unfit for mainstream publications.
That unique quality is what drew the Schlesinger Library to zines in the first place. A 2007 talk by graphic novel scholar Hillary Chute “convinced us that we should be collecting these more seriously,” says Marylene P. Altieri, a Curator of Books and Printed Materials at Schlesinger. “They were a really important avenue for women’s and girls’ voices to be heard in a completely unfiltered way, not going through any kind of editorial or censoring process.”
The Schlesinger collection’s ultimate goal is “to preserve these voices,” Altieri adds. “These people are not in your main books and periodicals...So if researchers of the future want to find out anything about them, they need collections like this.”
Such a focus on preservation is immediately apparent upon visiting Schlesinger. Per library rules, the zines must be brought out of off-site storage and can only be viewed in the library’s reading room, one box at a time. Manila folders separate each zine, many of which are sealed off in plastic bags.
A ten minute walk away from the Schlesinger, at the Democracy Center on Mt. Auburn St., lies yet another zine collection. Here the public can browse at will, unsupervised, taking zines out of the cardboard holders that line its shelves and retiring to a worn couch to read. It occupies only one room; the wood-panelled walls and organized clutter create a distinct impression of coziness.
“It’s kind of funny, because we’re sort of punky and radical in a way, but we’re also just like the most wholesome thing ever,” says Gabrielle Lapoli, co-librarian of the Papercut Zine Library. “It’s [run by] people who want to take their free time to enter data into a database, to make sure that people can find the things that they want.”
Papercut Zine Library began just over ten years ago as a personal collection and gradually evolved into its present display of over 16,000 zines. The library is entirely volunteer-run. Its current focus is cataloging, with the hope that it can return to its previous function as a lending library.
As the only zine library in Boston, Papercut attracts an array of visitors and zine donors: Much of its collection comes from people who send in zines from across the country and globe. In fact, when Schlesinger decided that they wanted to begin collecting zines, Altieri and other curators paid a visit to Papercut. “We went over there, just to look at: What is a zine? How many different kinds are there? How should we go about doing this?” Altieri says.
Years later, shared themes unite the two zine collections. Papercut’s selection is more expansive, but the bulk of its zines are in its “Feminism” and “Health and Sex” sections — much like Schlesinger.
Still, Papercut remains markedly less formal. At Schlesinger, you study zines; at Papercut, you read them. Sitting in Schlesinger’s sterile, white-walled reading room, there’s a dissonance between the environment and the zines’ anti-establishment nature.
In a zine called “Adventures in Menstruating,” the introduction reads, “One day, maybe this zine will be found next to (instead of) “Cosmo” on the newsstands, but for now it’s not exactly mainstream.” Another laments the punk scene’s hesitancy to discuss race and racism in its discourse and asks, “What are we left with?” — to which the zine offers itself as the only solution. Both are disillusioned by dominant media, but simultaneously desire to “one day” be a part of it, to force it to recognize them.
Maybe zines, then, are not simply representative of counterculture for counterculture’s sake. Rather, when the perspectives within them are dismissed by “culture,” the zine format presents a means to protest that erasure. Their presence in the Schlesinger and Papercut libraries alike serves as a testament to the success of such an endeavor — giving zines the privilege of place within public spheres and institutional memory.

As I pull the mask over my face and peer through the black steel mesh, I can’t help but smile. I am standing in the middle of a remodeled industrial warehouse with 14 other women, ranging from middle school students to working professionals. With our leggings, graphic tees, and mismatched socks, we could’ve gathered for a yoga class — if it weren’t for the three-foot-long swords we held.
We are wide-eyed and fidgety as we wait in anticipation of our first lesson in Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA). We’ve gathered on a Saturday afternoon for “Give a Girl a Sword!”, an introduction to sword fighting workshop for women hosted by the Boston Armizare at the Athena School of Arms. Over the next four hours, instructors Christina R. Twombly and Jackie D. Doyle lead us in footwork, cutting, and thrusting drills, and then guide us step-by-step through a fighting sequence.
Rarely have I wielded so much as a large kitchen knife, and the heavy — albeit blunt — sword feels awkward in my hands. My movements start out uncertain, unbalanced. I instinctively flinch when my partner strikes my mask’s steel netting, inches from my eye.
“Don’t be afraid to hit harder,” Twombly tells me. I swing again.
***
As Twombly and Doyle explain, the Boston Armizare studies and recreates the teachings of Fiore dei Liberi, a 14th century knight and fencing master whose manual Flower of Battle depicts a variety of fighting techniques. Although there have been famous female warriors throughout history — Joan of Arc, Boudica, Ching Shih — sword fighting has been, and remains, a male-dominated sport.
When Twombly first looked up “sword fighting” on a whim and joined the Boston Armizare, she was the only woman in the club. She was determined to bring her hobby to a wider audience, however, and set out to show other women that they, too, can enjoy martial arts.
“You see it all the time in the media, just men wielding swords, and that’s fine,” she says. “And little boys grow up and they’re like, ‘I want to be a knight,’ and that’s cool. But then when girls do it, it’s like, ‘Oh, no, you want to be a princess.’” Twombly, who is now rated 9th in the nation for women’s longsword, rolls her eyes.
The Give a Girl a Sword campaign was created by Esphinges, the first female international HEMA network. Last year, Twombly proposed the workshop to her club, and she was given control of its instruction and design.
“This is going to be for women; it’s going to be taught by women,” says Mike J. O’Brien, president of the Boston Armizare. “It’s inclusive to all women. So cis women, trans women, non-binary identifying people — we wanted this to be very open and a safe space for them to come and try something new.”
Twombly also addresses the economic barrier to entry for her hobby: “Equipment costs a lot of money, because it’s pretty specialized,” she says. In order to increase HEMA’s accessibility, she has made this workshop free of charge.
***
This is the third Give a Girl a Sword event hosted by the Boston Armizare, and, according to Twombly, each event has garnered more interest than the last. All 15 spots in the workshop were filled within seconds of the RSVP opening online — set just one minute past midnight. Twombly partly attributes the surge in interest to popular media like Game of Thrones and Wonder Woman, “where we see women being badass.”
Indeed, it is pretty damn cool when my motions become smoother and I grow more confident performing the sequence of attack and defense. I feel the energy flowing up through my arms, ending in the satisfying, powerful contact of sword on sword. By the end of the workshop, our nervous giggles have been replaced by the clacking of blades echoing off the walls.
As we take off our gloves and put on our shoes to head home, Twombly explains to me the meaning behind her workshop’s unofficial motto, “Fight like a girl!”
“The original term was used as a derogative, to mean ‘badly’ or ‘weakly’ or what have you,” she explains. “Now we can kind of turn that around on its head,” Twombly says. “Now we’re like, yeah, we’re proud of that. We fight like girls. Yes we do.”

Alexa, what’s the forecast for today? Hey Google, how far is the nearest gas station? Siri, what’s the score of the Super Bowl?
While the deadpan replies and nightmarish “Black Mirror” portrayals of artificial intelligence might frighten, artificial intelligence assistants have gradually become an unremarkable part of many people’s lives.
Perceptive Automata, a Boston-based startup founded in 2015, aims to make the presence of autonomous vehicles on our roads as mundane as asking Siri to tell a joke. But the stakes may be higher than the ones chipper AI assistants present: while Siri’s occasional misinterpretation of a simple command might result in an inconvenient manual Google search, a self-driving car’s mistake could result in a fatal accident.
In 2004, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), a research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense, hosted a research competition for American “fully autonomous ground vehicles.” On the off-road desert track of the first “DARPA Grand Challenge,” not a single car completed the specified course, thwarted by environmental features of the terrain like rocks and embankments, as well as faulty navigation and sensing technology.
Still these failures didn’t discourage investment in self-driving cars: Hundreds of startups and corporations from Uber to Google dove into developing autonomous car technologies as the fields of AI and machine learning exploded.
The next year, the second DARPA Grand Challenge hosted more vehicles and boasted a higher course-completion rate, with five vehicles completing a course similar to the previous year’s.
However, the pedestrian-free route of the Grand Challenge poses a stark contrast with the busy streets of a city like Cambridge. So while there have been great strides in the “bottom-up” strategy of developing autonomous cars that accomplish fundamental tasks like avoiding trees, recognizing signs, stopping for people, and sharing the road with other forms of transportation, the industry is still riddled with accidents. According to data from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, there have been 104 on-road collision reports involving self-driving cars since 2014. (California is the only state that requires companies to report details about their testing, out of five states total which allow this testing on normal streets.)
Even the mechanisms to prevent fatalities can unexpectedly impede the effectiveness of these vehicles. For example, the emergency stop capability of an autonomous car can backfire, explains Sam Anthony, the Chief Technology Officer of Perceptive Automata. The cars are designed to err on the side of caution, which “means that self-driving cars will be incredibly easy to troll,” Anthony wrote in a Slate opinion piece. Merely “[s]ticking a foot out in the road or waving a piece of cloth around” could be enough to make a driverless car halt, risking a rear-end collision.
Perceptive Automata takes a novel approach to circumvent this shortcoming of overly-cautious driverless technology with artificial intelligence that reflects human thought processes. By analyzing everything from posture and shoulder tension to how someone is holding their coffee cup or phone, “[we’re] getting at the underlying dimensions of what’s inside someone’s head as it relates to driving,” Anthony explains. The AI then uses these variables to judge the extent to which the car’s system meets the “intent” and “awareness” options. Only then will the car determine whether to continue or slow to a stop.
So while vehicles cannot interact with pedestrians as we do behind the wheel — a self-driving car cannot glare or give a gentle nod — Perceptive Automata “modules” study the details of pedestrian behavior to analyze whether someone wants to cross the road before one has driven past them or knows that the car is there.
Anthony credits the growth of Perceptive Automata to both his wide range of collaborators and the research he conducted at Harvard Vision Sciences Laboratory, a psychology research lab that seeks “to understand the cognitive and computational basis of visual intelligence.”
Already, the automobile community has welcomed the small startup of around 25 employees, with a recent partnership with Toyota AI Ventures in a demonstration at the 2020 Consumer Electronics Show held earlier this month and ongoing distribution deals with Dependable Highway Express Inc., a large trucking company, and Volvo Trucks North America.
As autonomous driving companies put the finishing touches on the basic functionalities of their vehicles, Anthony explains that Perceptive Automata’s greatest challenge is perfectly timing their AI module’s release to coincide with the release of these self-driving cars. Then those modules can be used as “add-ons” for these systems to create a smoother and safer ride, with the ultimate goal of “making autonomous vehicles boring. I want to drive such that I don’t think about their driving,” Anthony says of driverless cars.
When these vehicles can function as “good citizens of the road,” Anthony believes that people will use and interact with them comfortably. By playing the “human” driver that can read and understand millions of physical signals in a split second, these vehicles could play roles in our daily lives larger than just assistants like Alexa or Siri.
Anthony is optimistic about the future of driverless cars, viewing Perceptive Automata’s work as the last stretch to ensuring safe and autonomous vehicle-populated roads. While these streets of the future won’t be our reality tomorrow, Anthony uses a popular saying in the computer science world to describe his outlook: “The first 90% of the work takes 90% of the time, and the last 10% of the work takes 90% of the time.”

I follow the flyers to the Arts Wing on the second floor of the Smith Campus Center, a low-ceilinged, seldom-trafficked space. I’m looking for the opening reception for the first-ever Smith Campus Center Staff Arts Show, an exhibition featuring over 50 pieces of artwork by more than 30 Harvard staff members.
The space, rectangular and painted white, is itself a blank canvas, primed for the colors and textures of artwork on its walls: a quilted self-portrait, a watercolor diver leaping off a springboard, a photograph of the sun-dappled space beneath the Harvard Stadium bleachers, geometry-inspired wooden furniture. Artists and art enthusiasts alike mill about, chatting, laughing, and occasionally dipping into the catered spread on a folding table in the back.
The show’s goals are threefold: to showcase the staff’s artistic talent, to foster inclusion and belonging, and to build community. The vision statement reads: “We want to provide the opportunity to show our ‘whole selves’ — the artistic, creative sides that may not otherwise be a part of our work at Harvard.” For many participants, their artistic pursuits long predate their campus jobs.
Karen M. Larsen, a staff assistant at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, used to work full-time selling quilts at high-end craft fairs, a passion she inherited from her mother. At the show, she displays one such quilt, a portrait of her younger self surrounded by waves of color and punctuated by delicate embroidery. Her inspirations are varied: Van Gogh’s brushstrokes, abstract use of fabric and color, and what she described as an “Amish” aesthetic.
Jack P. Staid, an administrator at Harvard University Health Services, has been taking piano lessons since age six and pursuing composition since high school. He performs three original piano compositions throughout the show, each filled with rich and vibrant chords.
Both Larsen and Staid see their jobs on campus as complementary, and even beneficial, to their artistic pursuits. For Larsen, the switch to a nine-to-five has provided the stability and financial security to pursue art in her free time, and Staid enjoys using Harvard’s practice rooms. Both mention the opportunity to take Extension School classes as a major perk of the job, with Larsen taking a photography course and Staid planning to enroll in an urban design course.
“We want a way to show [that] the ‘work self’ is not the only one that defines us,” says Emily Ronald, a committee member and participating artist, who echoes the show’s commitment to create a space for peoples’ “whole selves.” Or, as fellow organizer Camille R. Gladieux explains more bluntly, “we want to be celebrated beyond our capitalistic production.”
The celebration is also intended to extend beyond just the staff community. Art show participant Brianne Sullivan, a Harvard administrative assistant, says the show is partly inspired by a longer-established art show for staff of the Harvard Art Museums. But whereas the museum staff show is held in the Harvard Art Museums basement and open to Harvard ID access only — “people couldn’t even bring their spouses,” Sullivan explains — the Smith Center show seeks to create dialogue between all parties on campus, by virtue of its more central location and its status as free and open to the public.
Leon C. Welch, an HUHS employee of 33 years and an avid knitter, hopes the show will foster more meaningful interaction between staff, students, and faculty. He says there is, at times, a general sense that Harvard students are “privileged” and “spoiled,” but he is a firm believer in the uniting power of art. He hopes faculty and students will see a new side of the staff through the show and will be able to recognize the “things that come from their heart, that they do without pay.” Welch proudly shows me two cabled hats: one black and one lavender with a pom-pom on top. The lavender, he explains, is for a worker at Saloniki Greek and the black one for a worker at Tatte Bakery.
The opening reception is lively, but aside from two student photographers covering the event, I seem to be the only student in attendance. Most of the attendees appear to be fellow staff members, admiring their colleagues’ work. If there are faculty members present, they are not immediately visible to me. Of all the visions for the show, “establishing a space where the staff can share their creative endeavors with each other” seems to be the most successful.
Nonetheless, the sense of community is strong, and even though I’m not a staff member, I feel welcomed. Larsen shakes my hand and thanks me sincerely. Welch tells me I’ve changed his opinion on Harvard students and wishes me the best of luck.
On my way out, I pass a wall-sized sheet of paper open to artwork from anyone. So far, this “Collaborative Art Wall” is mostly blank, but a few drawings jump out: a llama with glasses, a colorful gnome, and a wonderfully nonsensical poem. To the left, beside a box of markers, a sign: “Art is for everyone.”

About a century before the recent strike by Harvard graduate student workers, Harvard students played a different role in local labor organizing efforts — serving as volunteer strikebreakers.
In February 1912, dozens of Harvard undergraduates were absent from their mid-year exams. Rather than spend their afternoons in lecture halls being hushed by proctors they were galavanting down Essex St. in central Cambridge on horseback to disrupt the Lawrence Textile Mill Strike with the university’s explicit permission.
The striking workers were protesting child labor and wage reduction. As the strike — which was backed by the Industrial Workers of the World — went on, protesters became increasingly violent. In response, the mayor of Lawrence, Michael A. Scanlon, requested militia from surrounding towns, drawing in Harvard students alongside civilians. A 1974 article in The Crimson reported one “aristocratic Boston observer” saying the students “rather enjoyed going down there and having their fling at those people.” Participating students automatically received C marks on the exams they missed.
Harvard students again undercut the aims of a strike during the Boston Police Department strike of 1919. While law enforcement struck for fair wages, decreased working hours, and habitable station houses, over 150 Harvard undergraduates enrolled as replacement police officers.
For four years before the strike, the Boston Police Department’s nascent trade union had unsuccessfully sought recognition and reported grievances to the mayor and police commissioner. Maintaining that they had exhausted all other modes of negotiation, Boston police officers organized under an American Federation of Labor charter in August 1919 and went on strike in early September. Within a few days, looting and other petty crimes increased in several neighborhoods across the city.
Alarmed by reports of civil disorder, Harvard students flocked to Boston’s Chamber of Commerce building to quell unrest. The Boston Herald reported “carloads” of young men pouring into the city: The roughly 50 Harvard students who enrolled individually were joined by Harvard’s 125-person football team. One teammate remembers Harvard football coach Bob Fisher dismissing them, saying “to hell with football if men are needed to protect Boston.” In a matter of hours, almost 200 college students took to Boston’s streets armed with night sticks and revolvers.
Harvard’s administration itself demanded student involvement. Responding to a telegram inquiring about the college’s role in the strike, then-Harvard President Abbot Lawrence Lowell invoked the school’s “traditions of public service...in times of crisis,” urging all able students to “prepare themselves for such service as the governor of the commonwealth may call upon them to render.”
A committee of three acting deans and two college seniors opened an all-night recruiting office in University Hall, posting calls for volunteers on bulletin boards around campus. According to several students, the committee tacked notes addressed, “To All Harvard Men” on every student’s door. The notice included President Lowell’s message invoking public service and an appeal to any man who could provide a “motor car or motorcycle with or without sidecar to report at once to University Hall.”
Though glorified, strikebreaking came at a dangerous cost, and the violence perpetrated by strikebreakers did not go unanswered. During the 1919 New England Telephone Operator’s strike, working class defendants of the strikers mauled several students from Harvard, MIT, Brown, and Tufts, beating some unconscious and knocking their teeth out.
According to University of Oklahoma professor Steven H. Norwood’s research on student strikebreaking, being a strikebreaker was seen as a reaffirmation of one’s “manhood.” Conversely, women's colleges of the time were incredibly restrictive in allowing students to leave campus, especially due to the danger and violence strikebreaking entailed. Many women’s colleges would often even support the pro-labor argument –– notably Vassar, Wellesley, Barnard, and Bryn Mawr, all of which had students travel to New York to support the striking women garment workers. In fact, Radcliffe stood against Harvard in support of the strikers in 1912.
In reality, the College’s official position condemned strikebreaking. So when one disapproving Harvard College alumnus called University Hall to ask when Harvard had “become a training ground for strikebreakers,” the committee insisted that students were not merely trying to disrupt the striking police officers’ efforts. “It is not as strike-breakers that the undergraduates are offering their services,” the committee maintained. “They are enrolling solely to protect life and property.”

Suraj Yengde grew up in a room similar in size to his office at the Harvard Kennedy School, about 100 square feet. But while the office is his own, he shared his childhood room with five others. His desk sits where a raised bed would have — he gestures above, below, and to the sides of the wooden desk, pointing to where each family member would have slept. Then, he sketches loose rectangles into the air with his fingers: Instead of the smooth white walls of his current office, decorated with large, framed portraits of Angela Davis, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and B.R. Ambedkar — a hero of Yengde’s credited with beginning the Dalit Buddhist movement to advocate for Dalit rights and helped write the Indian constitution — his home was made of unmortared brick topped by a corrugated metal roof, with sand perpetually blowing into the room through its cracks.
Yengde, himself a member of India’s Dalit, or “untouchable” caste, is a postdoctoral fellow at the Kennedy School. His research and activism focus on the caste structures that produce Dalit oppression, as well as Black Studies and migration in the Global South.
Most of India’s over 200 million Dalits face segregation, extreme poverty, and prejudice — products of a caste hierarchy that, Yengde says, not only physically traps Dalits, but also circumscribes their ambitions. Attending college, let alone studying abroad, were almost unthinkable to most Dalits living in Nanded, India, where Yengde grew up: According to census data, only two percent of Dalits in India have a college degree. Though Harvard has over 600 Indian international students and scholars, Yengde knows of only three others of his caste.
Yengde has spent his entire life doing what he at one time believed to be unimaginable — attending college in India, studying in England, pursuing a PhD in South Africa, and coming to Harvard in 2016 to finish his dissertation.
“You don’t even dream of this shit,” he says. “You dream what is in your limits.”
While Yengde’s journey is extraordinary, he says the caste-based oppression he has encountered is typical. He grew up in what he called a “slum,” where open sewer-lines were the norm; across India, more than 20 percent of Dalits lack access to clean drinking water. When he ran for student union in college, lackies working for a rival candidate kidnapped him and physically harassed his family (despite this, he won three years in a row); tens of thousands of anti-Dalit crimes, many of them violent, are reported each year. At the University of Mumbai, students and professors ignored, belittled, and infantilized Yengde, even artificially lowering his grades to prevent him from being top of his class. (He ranked third, marks high enough to earn the scholarship that allowed him to study in England.)
Yengde’s drive to push the limits set by his caste, to pursue an education, and to fight for global liberation, was in part inspired by his father, who was a member of the Dalit Panthers — a political organization styled after the Black Panther Party. Size is not the only thing Yengde’s childhood home and Harvard office have in common — books are another constant. Today hundreds of books by Amiri Baraka, Ambedkar, Audre Lorde, and others fill his many shelves; as a child, his father, who had a ninth grade education, shoved a plank into the brick wall and piled it with his own collection, with authors including Tolstoy and Einstein, influences that have stayed with Yengde throughout his life. It was his father who urged him to pursue a law degree.
During his final year of college, Yengde began looking abroad. “I decided that the education system was not nourishing my intellectual hunger,” he says. His vision encompassed the globe, whereas everyone around him wanted “to be the king of a small palace.”
Caste, again, stood in his way. Yengde had little money, and nobody in his community knew anyone who had been abroad. He travelled alone to a city six hours away to seek help and information, knocking door-to-door before finally learning about a scholarship for Dalit students to study abroad. Lack of education, resources, and knowledge make such scholarships and similar affirmative action programs inaccessible to most Dalits. In 2003, only 1.5 percent of Indians in the U.S. were of the Dalit caste or other lower castes, and today over 90 percent of Indians abroad are from the upper castes.
“One of my quests is that Harvard makes the concentrated effort to get more students from the community I come from, because that will be an actual investment into correcting certain historical measures,” Yengde says.
I first met Yengde in Harvard Square on a rainy night, where he was setting up for a 24-hour protest against India’s Citizenship Amendment Act. He emphasized the law’s discriminatory effect on Dalits. As Yengde has traveled across the globe for his education and activism, he’s often found himself to be the only Dalit. “It has been quite a good and bad, but lonely, life,” Yengde says. “But it’s for a purpose.”
“What [the protest] tells to the people across the world is that within the Harvard institution there is a sensitivity,” he told me. “That there is fighting for the human, civil, political rights of the people who don’t have that.”
When Yengde left India, his caste categorization followed him. In England, Indian students of higher castes beat him up. During his first three years at Harvard, he generally avoided socializing with other Indian students, some of whom have heckled and slighted him.
Even the very names of other Indian students can be haunting: “My experience has been of trauma,” he says. “The last names that people have, I have had horrible experiences with them growing up, because they were the masters — these were the landlords, these were the supervisors, these were the managers.” The burden is on the bearers of “hegemonic names,” Yengde says, to earn his trust.
Despite this isolation, Yengde says he has also found incredible support at Harvard, especially from Black students, scholars, and activists. “My colleagues around, they really understand my value,” he exclaims, leaning back and spreading his arms wide. “Isn’t it amazing — that someone actually realizes what you bring to the table?”
Divinity School Professor Cornel R. West, along with Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of History, Race, and Public Policy at HKS, have been key mentors.
“Suraj is the towering young Dalit intellectual of his generation,” West says. “He’s brilliant, he’s courageous, and engaged in the struggle for freedom.”
Yengde is working on five book projects with two future ideas in mind, writes a column for one of India’s prominent English-language newspapers, intends to co-teach two classes — one with West and one with Muhammad — and engages tirelessly in the movement for Dalit rights and global justice.
“Desperation creates energy, in your mind, in your brain, in your heart, in your body,” Yengde says. “You know it, it works like an electric current with you, until you achieve what you aim to achieve.”

Harvard researchers shook the scientific world to its core on Jan. 22 when they proved that stress makes hair turn gray. On the heels of their groundbreaking discovery, the researchers have published a series of equally revolutionary papers:
The Sun Rises Every Morning and Sets Every Evening
Persons Age 5+
INTRODUCTION:
For millions and millions of years, the sun has risen and set each day. Our lab, however, decided to finally remove the ambiguity of this process through controlled experiments and calculated methodology. We are confident that we will reshape the field of astronomy with this publication.
METHODS:
Using advanced meteorological technology, we calculated the exact time the sun would rise each morning and set each evening. With our newly developed algorithm that factors in age, race, gender, shoe size, and favorite hand sanitizer scent, we selected one representative of the entire human population each day for one year (the duration of the study). This representative was tasked each morning and evening to ensure the sun did what we hypothesized would happen, based on millennia of data.
CONCLUSION:
It did.
Riding a Scooter Through Harvard Square Causes Pedestrians to Hate You
Pedestri N. and Pendergrass D.
INTRODUCTION:
Pedestrians in the Square have been plagued by riders of Razor scooters for years. With the introduction of motorized scooters in Cambridge, reports of disgruntled passersby being shunted aside or rudely forced to step off the sidewalk have spiked. Our team was interested in analyzing the current public opinion regarding those who ride scooters; we ultimately hope to confirm that the general biases against scooters are not unfounded.
METHODS:
Data was collected from a randomly selected sample of scooter riders (SR); N=156. The control group consisted of pedestrians; N=112. Responses were sorted by type of scooter (Razor kick scooter, Razor electric scooter, Lime, Bird). Members of the SRs group self-reported the number of times they experienced adverse behavior (AB) from a pedestrian: being cursed at, bumped, given dirty looks, or shoved off the scooter which was then hijacked by a stranger.
RESULTS:
Our analysis shows that riding a scooter results in an average 31200.04 percent increase in ABs from pedestrians. The control group reported only two instances of AB, both of which occurred when a Bird scooter rider yelled at them to “Get the fuck out of my way!” Each SR reported at least one instance of AB; the maximum was 27, for a total of 624. Bird scooter users reported the highest frequency of ABs.
CONCLUSION:
Riding a scooter makes people hate you.
Living in the Quad Makes You Stronger
Cabot T., Currier A.B., Pforzheimer C.
INTRODUCTION:
Many believe students living in the quad have on average a two standard deviation greater mass of leg muscle than students living in River Houses. Our team sought to investigate the physical differences exhibited by students who have lived in the quad for one year or longer, ultimately hoping to verify or debunk the advantages touted by quadlings.
METHODS:
A sample of six students was randomly selected from each river house within the strata of juniors and seniors. 18 students were then randomly selected from each quad house. A student from each river house was paired with a student from one of the three quad houses (54 pairs total). Each pair engaged in a squat hold competition to determine which house was superior. Wins and losses were tallied for later data analysis.
RESULTS:
Out of the 54 matches, river houses lost 48 and won five, resulting in a 9.26 percent win rate for the river compared to an 88.9 percent win rate for the quad. (Note: The final match was a tie, as a Bird scooter rider crashed into a pair as they were walking to the match, rendering both combatants incapacitated. This instance was scrubbed from our data analysis). Our analysis of the matches indicated greater leg strength in quadlings as well as a penchant for smack-talk, which one student credited to “dealing with bullshit about the quad for the last two years.”
CONCLUSION:
Living in the quad makes your legs buff and your roasts more devastating.
Public response has been overwhelmingly positive, with surveyed individuals declaring their endless gratitude for these scientists’ dedication to confirming previously unproven phenomena.
The world eagerly waits for the publication of their latest project: “Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is Not an Actual Rock.”

There’s a sort of primal satisfaction that comes from eating a chicken foot — biting around for the knuckle, pinching off a joint with your incisors, sucking ferociously at what little cartilage, skin, and sauce can exist on a centimeter-long segment of chicken toe. I have no way of knowing how satisfied the Paleolithic man felt lounging by the fire after his dinner of freshly slain mammoth, but, as I admire the mound of chicken bones on my plate, I feel that I’ve come pretty close.
Of course, some would disagree: those who would prefer a drumstick or the sterile civility of a chicken nugget to the jagged realism of the chicken foot. These are the people who cut the crust off their sandwiches, who don’t like onions on their burgers, who call themselves sushi lovers but only ever order the California roll. I know, because I went to high school with these people.
Despite being one of three Chinese kids at my high school, growing up, I never really thought about race. I didn’t get called a chink or have my lunch money stolen or anything like that — the Hydroflasks plastered with Bernie 2016 stickers that littered my high school cafeteria precluded such behavior. The only time the cultural rift manifested was when I — like countless immigrant kids before me — brought lunch to school. Even the staunchest of my white liberal peers couldn’t resist commenting.
“What is that?”
“That looks disgusting.”
“Are you going to eat that?” (No, I was actually going to blend it up and make a face mask.)
My friends were even more direct. In four years of after-school homework sessions, sleepovers, and birthday parties, never once had they come over to my house for dinner. The most common (and most eloquently worded) reason: “Hell no, your mom’s gonna make chicken feet or some shit.” If I were more oblivious, I wouldn’t have cared. Chicken feet isn’t exactly my family’s typical dinner, and not everyone is a hardcore hunter-gatherer like me.
But it was never about the chicken feet.
It was about their conception of Chinese food, of Chinese culture. The shady Chinese restaurants and “poisonous” MSG. The dirty Chinatowns impossibly “rife” with coronavirus. The squalid, authoritarian, communist police state on the other side of the Pacific with surveillance cameras on every corner and portraits of Xi Jinping in every living room. The depictions of China that color the collective American imagination and — despite what CNN or Fox News or the New York Times say — were far from the truth, far from the China that I knew.
Of course, I couldn’t expect them to know all that. My friends didn’t grow up watching Chinese cartoons and never ran up and down the snack aisles of 99 Ranch Market. Nonetheless, it still bothered me.
I studied abroad this past summer in Beijing — a polluted, aggressive, energetic, wondrous city that actually does have surveillance cameras on every corner, but also just as many restaurants. With me were a few other students, all Chinese-American, who, as one does when the dining hall serves the same thing every day, ate out whenever we could. We ate Japanese food made by Korean people and Pakistani food made by Chinese people and lots of Chinese food made by Chinese people. (Those who say America is the immigrant capital of the world have yet to visit a night market in Beijing.)
One night, we ate at a dim sum restaurant and someone suggested we order chicken feet. For the first time in my life, I heard not one, not two, but an entire table of nineteen and twenty year-olds proclaim, “I love chicken feet!”
I felt validation, pride — I had found my people.
Not two seconds passed before someone then asked: “But have you tried duck intestine?”
Then someone else: “Yes, that’s so good, but once I had pig brain!”
“Not as good as pig blood though.”
“What about fried crickets?”
“Snake soup?”
“Sheep penis?”
It was like this culinary cold war, a pissing contest for who’d eaten the weirdest animal appendage. I was hurt, not just because I had lost the war (my mom was never able to find frozen sheep penis at the grocery store, not even at Whole Foods), but because we were fighting it in the first place. What were we trying to prove? And to whom? Why?
Most of the Chinese-Americans at that table were second generation. This means that we are, fundamentally, American; we watch The Office and like ice in our drinks and use Instagram far more often than WeChat.
It also means that our parents were the first to immigrate to the United States. They carried with them the thousands of years of culture from their ancestors — the history, the values, the food — but they faced challenges much more pressing than cafeteria taunting. They had to survive, to adapt to this odd country where people say exactly what they’re thinking and eat rice with a spoon and don’t take off their shoes indoors. Our parents still face that struggle; my mom, to this day, never feels confident enough to go to the doctor alone.
We, as Chinese-Americans, are the Avatar, the bridge between the two worlds — it’s right there in the name. We dress and talk like Americans, but we also grew up in our parents’ house and, often, in China. This is cool, sometimes — at middle school multicultural fairs or in personal essay-writing classes. But more than often, it sucks — when we don’t get a pop culture reference or when we’re passed over for a job promotion or when we can’t have conversations with our grandparents.
Balancing two identities is hard, and people cope by picking a side, or trying to. Some choose to talk to their parents in English and drink coffee instead of tea. Others study abroad in Beijing and tell everyone about all the sheep and pig appendages they’ve eaten.
I still don’t know the answers to these questions — questions of which side is better or what the “right” way to be Chinese-American is. Neither does the Internet (I’ve checked). We are left, then, with just our feelings. The feeling of self-consciousness when we bring leftovers to school or of shame at ordering food in broken Chinese. The feeling of being too Chinese to be American and too American to be Chinese.
The feeling of biting into a chicken foot, however — of the sweet-savory-spicy taste that fills your mouth and the sticky-chewy texture that messes with your tongue — makes it all just a little bit better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard University Health Services advised some students who recently returned to campus from China to “maintain social distance” of at least six feet from others amid a growing global coronavirus outbreak, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
Chinese officials have reported 28,018 cases of coronavirus to date and cases have been confirmed in 24 other countries. On Feb. 2, the U.S. State Department issued its highest level of travel advisory for China — suggesting that Americans “Do Not Travel” to the country. There are now 12 confirmed cases in the United States, including one student attending the University of Massachusetts, Boston. As of Wednesday evening, that remains the lone reported case of coronavirus in the state.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 and HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen sent an email to all Harvard affiliates on Sunday with a health form for those who returned from China after Jan. 18 or are currently in China to fill out in order to receive further guidance from HUHS.
On Tuesday, HUHS updated its website and advised those who have returned from China since Jan. 19 to fill out the form.
The email obtained by The Crimson, sent to a student who filled out the form and indicated they did not show any telltale symptoms of the virus, states that the student should nonetheless avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth, which “accelerates the spread of infections.”
The email also advised maintaining a six-foot “social distance” as often as possible in the 14 days following departure from China, as well as washing hands “often” and not sharing various utensils and toiletries. It also advised reaching out to HUHS if any symptoms of the coronavirus — including a cough, fever, and shortness of breath — develop.
The email states that HUHS will continue to monitor the outbreak and that advice is based on all currently available information, even for those unlikely to contract or spread coronavirus.
“While you may be at low risk of carrying the infection, we advise this out of an abundance of caution,” the email reads.

Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced that a pair of professors will head the Chemistry department at a faculty meeting Tuesday after erstwhile chair Charles M. Lieber was placed on administrative leave last week after being charged in federal court with failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
Chemistry professors Theodore A. Betley and Daniel Kahne will serve as interim co-chairs of the department in Lieber's place.
At Tuesday’s meeting, Gay addressed the federal charges against Lieber and introduced Betley and Kahne’s new roles.
“The charges brought by the U.S. government against Professor Lieber are extremely serious; he has been placed on administrative leave,” she said. “Professors Dan Kahne and Ted Betley have agreed to co-chair CCB for the rest of this academic year, and for this I am deeply grateful.”
In a statement provided by Harvard spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs wrote the search for a new chair for the department had been ongoing prior to Lieber’s administrative leave.
“This was Prof. Lieber’s final year as CCB chair, and our office was in the process of considering potential successors,” Stubbs wrote. “Both Professors Kahne and Betley are held in very high regard by their colleagues, and both were strongly recommended for the Chair role.”
Stubbs said that the many responsibilities of the new department chair motivated the appointment of two co-chairs, instead of one.
Stubbs cited the “urgency” of providing support to current students, including postdoctoral positions, continuing the work of Lieber’s research group, and ongoing demands of a “large and complex department” as reasons for the double appointment.
Betley, who has taught at Harvard since 2007, leads the Betley Research Group at Harvard, which focuses on synthetic inorganic chemistry. Betley was named a top innovator under 35 by the MIT Technology Review in 2008 and received the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2013.
Kahne, a professor in the department since 2004, studies antibiotic resistance and co-teaches the popular introductory biology course, Life Sciences 1A: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences.” He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences last May and won the Gordon Hammes Lectureship Award in July.
Multiple professors said they are pleased with the selection of Kahne and Betley as co-chairs of the department.
“I think the appointment of Dan and Ted is fantastic — they both are highly committed to the department,” said Brian Liau, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology.
Betley and Kahne did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’s Graduate Student Council discussed advocacy projects, career development, and the aftermath of the graduate student union strike at its first open meeting of the semester Wednesday evening.
Speaking to assembled council members in Lehman Hall’s graduate student lounge, the council’s president, Germanic Languages and Literatures Ph.D. candidate Zachary M. Hayworth, opened with an overview of the GSC’s mission and responsibilities. He then informed students of overarching themes the council had set for the months of February and March.
For February’s theme of diversity and inclusion, the council invited Director of Student Services and GSAS Title IX Coordinator Danielle Farrell to present resources available to help graduate students seek recourse for academic concerns, workplace issues, and other matters.
Farrell emphasized that students considering reaching out to her office for help should feel confident their concerns will be kept private if they so choose.
“We really center on agency,” Farrell said. “A lot of times when people are saying, ‘are you confidential?’ or, ‘is this going to go anywhere?’ most students are really wondering, ‘are you going to tell my advisor or my department?' Like, no.”
The council then proceeded to discuss its March theme of career development. Hayworth informed attendees of multiple services that Harvard provides to further students’ career pursuits, including through the Office of Career Services.
“There’s an increasing number of ways for students to take an active role in addressing issues of mental health,” Hayworth said. “The GSC’s bigger mission is to put power into the hands of graduate students, to create the GSAS that they want to see.”
Germanic Languages and Literatures Ph.D. candidate Hans M. Pech, who serves as a liaison between the GSC and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, updated the council on recent developments in the negotiations between University administrators and the union.
In January 2020, federal mediators began working to conciliate the two parties, which for 17 months have been bargaining over HGSU-UAW’s first contract. Though the union’s three-week-long strike ended on Jan. 1, the two sides remain at odds over three key issues: healthcare, compensation, and procedures to adjudicate sexual harassment and discrimination complaints.
Later, Hayworth stressed the distinction between the GSC and HGSU-UAW’s roles in graduate student life and responsibilities to GSAS students, highlighting the limited overlap in each groups’ membership as well as slight differences in goals.
“But I think also it’s important for the GSC to keep waving the banner of the union,” Hayworth said.
“We’re not a platform for the union, definitely not. But we provide one venue for the union to disseminate its mission and goals,” he added.
Correction: Feb. 6, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted GSAS Title IX Coordinator Danielle Farrell as saying that her office centers "on secrecy." In fact, she said her office centers "on agency."

The Defending Digital Democracy project — a Harvard Kennedy School initiative that aims to prevent election-related cyber attacks — held seminars last fall with the Iowa Democratic and Republican parties to prepare for potential threats to this year’s caucuses.
Among the dreaded scenarios they discussed were problems with the systems used to report results, according to Republican Party of Iowa spokesperson Aaron Britt, who attended the seminars.
Britt said the seminars attempted to prepare caucus officials for a potential “worst-case scenario.”
“There were cybersecurity experts, national security experts, election security experts to sort of run through different scenarios with us and help us prepare for what a worst-case-scenario might look like on caucus night,” Britt said. “Based on that, they sort of helped us develop messaging strategies and response strategies for any potential catastrophe that might take place.”
That nightmare appeared to become a reality Monday night, as Democratic caucus results were delayed due to problems with the app that the party used to report the outcomes. Roughly eight percent of Democratic precincts are yet to be reported as of Wednesday evening, and the race is still considered too close to call by the Associated Press.
In a statement released on Tuesday, the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs — the HKS center that houses the initiative — said the Defending Digital Democracy Project held “a bipartisan cyber security tabletop exercise” in November to help the parties prepare for cyber threats ahead of Monday’s caucuses.
“The table top exercise simulated cyber and misinformation threats the parties could face prior to, during and after the caucuses,” the statement read.
The Defending Digital Democracy project has held cybersecurity preparedness exercises with election officials from 44 states, according to the statement.
The statement also clarified the project had no role in developing or testing the app used during the caucuses.
“It was not a technical exercise, and the technologies used on Caucus Night were not used or tested during the exercise,” the statement read. “Members of the D3P team, including Eric Rosenbach and Robby Mook, were not involved in vetting, approving or testing specific technologies used by the parties on Caucus Night at any time before, during or after this exercise.”
Eric B. Rosenbach, the co-director of the Belfer Center, and Robert E. Mook, Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign manager in 2016, helped to start the Defending Digital Democracy Project.
Iowa Democrats used an app developed by Shadow Inc. — a company founded by ex-Clinton campaign staffers — to have precincts report their results this year. In a press conference Tuesday, Iowa Democratic Party chairman Troy Price blamed a “a coding error” for the delay in the results.
In a statement posted on Shadow Inc.’s website, the company’s CEO, Gerard Niemira, acknowledged the failures in the process used to relay the Democratic caucus results.
“We sincerely regret the delay in the reporting of the results of last night's Iowa caucuses and the uncertainty it has caused to the candidates, their campaigns, and Democratic caucus-goers,” Niemira’s statement read. “As the Iowa Democratic Party has confirmed, the underlying data and collection process via Shadow's mobile caucus app was sound and accurate, but our process to transmit that caucus results data generated via the app to the IDP was not.”
The state’s Republican Party — which used a different app than the Democrats to tabulate their caucus results — had no reporting problems.
“Our reporting system worked flawlessly,” Britt said. “We never had an issue on caucus night.”
The GOP race in Iowa was virtually uncontested. President Donald J. Trump received 97 percent of the state’s Republican delegates.
Harvard Government Professor Jon C. Rogowski, who was in Iowa for the caucuses, said that the party’s failure to release timely results this year could lead to it losing its status as the first in the nation to vote.
“This very well could lead to Iowa losing its place as the first state to participate in the primary process,” Rogowski wrote in an email. “A number of other proposals have been floated over the years, including a nationwide primary, or choosing another state that may be more demographically representative.”
Iowa, which receives disproportionate attention from presidential candidates, has an electorate vastly less diverse than that of the broader Democratic electorate. While more than 9 in 10 Iowa caucus-goers on Monday were white, according to entrance polls, that figure is closer to 60 percent for the party as a whole.
As of Wednesday evening, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 held a narrow lead in Iowa over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) with 92 percent of precincts reporting.

Meet Mather, an app designed to connect Mather House residents, launched this past week in conjunction with several house-wide events to celebrate the app’s release.
The week consisted of both a "speed friending" and a coffee-and-conversation event to encourage Mather students to forge new friendships with each other. Since its release last week, Meet Mather has attracted more than 100 users.
David Jud, a tutor in Mather House, first had the idea to create the Meet Mather app as a final project for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science,” a class he took as a Ph.D. student. After finishing the course, Jud developed the Meet Mather app with the assistance of Mather student Thomas J. Wagg ’20 and Harvard University Information Technology over the course of a year and a half.
Jud said the inspiration for the app stemmed from a struggle shared between both Mather students and tutors to remember each other’s names.
“We have 400 students in the house, and even the best tutors only know 50-60 names,” Jud said. “Also, students said over and over again that they had seen this and that person in the dining hall, but thought it would be awkward to introduce themselves. I thought it would be a lot less awkward if they knew each other’s names.”
The app is comprised of a photo directory of all Matherites and games designed to help users learn each other’s names. Users earn points by matching residents’ names to their photos. The points are then tallied to rank Mather residents on a leaderboard.
In addition, each Meet Mather profile includes up to three fun fact questions, a list of their current classes, class year, and concentration information to allow students to make connections over shared interests.
Mather House Resident Dean Luke A. Leafgren said he believes Meet Mather will help to strengthen the house’s community.
“Meet Mather is one way to try to help students match faces with names and learn a few things about their neighbors, with the goal of making it easier to strike up a conversation and feel at home in this space.”
Wagg said that students should join the app as an avenue of meeting interesting people that populate campus.
“As a senior, I look around my dining hall and think, ‘I have no absolute idea who most of these people are, but these are some of the most interesting people in the world,’” Wagg said. “The Meet Mather app is the perfect way to find and connect with these people.”

A team of researchers from Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, McMaster University, and University of Pittsburgh discovered a new material that can exhibit chemical and mechanical responses to light — paving the way for computing to be executed with only beams of light rather than hard materials.
At the heart of the team’s work is a unique type of hydrogel, according to a recent paper the team published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Hydrogels are non-linear optical materials, a class of materials that change when they interact with light.
Interaction with light alters how the light propagates through the material, according to SEAS graduate student Amos Meeks, a co-author of the paper.
Anna C. Balazs, a professor of engineering at the University of Pittsburgh and another co-author of the study, said the hydrogel’s exposure to light or heat triggers a chemical reaction that causes the material to shrink. The collapse of material condenses the polymer and forces the light to become highly localized, rather than dispersed. When the light disappears, the hydrogel is able to return to its original state.
The unique feature of the group’s newly created hydrogel is its ability to couple several different responses at once, particularly the response to a light stimulus that ultimately causes the material to contract and alter the dispersion of light, according to Balazs.
“The optics is talking to the chemistry, which is talking to mechanical response, which in turn feeds back on the optics,” Balazs said. “Creating those kinds of feedback loops is very novel.”
Balazs said that the idea of a feedback loop could pave the way for the creation of materials with new features in the future.
“The integration of acting on different responses to give you one performance is stunning, and that’s the real advance here,” Balazs said. “What it really allows you to do is create materials that can maintain their state and are self-regulating. In response to a stimulus they can modulate their internal properties so they can deal with that stimulus.”
Kalaichelvi Saravanamuttu, an associate professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at McMaster and a co-author of the study, noted that the findings also contribute towards an emerging field called “materials that compute” — soft constructs that are responsive and designed with local computational ability.
“The paper presents a creative platform to generate soft adaptive constructs that could perform computational operations with visible light beams - without the need for external processors or electronic components” Saravanamuttu wrote in an emailed statement.
She added that the team’s work is distinct from other optical computing approaches.

“It is important to make a distinction between this work and other approaches to optical computing that examine ways to replace electronic functions in a digital computer with photon-based counterparts.”
Meeks said there are still many questions that need to be answered before this type of material could be applied or put to use.
“This is kind of the first demonstration of this phenomenon at all in these types of materials,” he said. “There’s a lot of questions that would still need to be answered before there’s any kind of application.”

On Super Bowl Sunday, the Harvard men’s and women’s tennis teams were far from focused on the primetime event later in the day. On their minds was the goal to rattle off more victories and keep the momentum going into later crucial matchups. And the focus paid off, as the Crimson teams dominated their competition in quick fashion.
WOMEN’S TENNIS
Harvard (3-1, 0-0 Ivy League) faced off against the women of UMass-Amherst in a Sunday morning contest and earned a clean 4-0 sweep. The match started off with two wins on the doubles court, with a duo of senior captain Natasha Gonzalez and sophomore Rachel Lim winning their matchup 6-4, and the pairing of two first-years, Kayla Leschly and Mihaela Marculescu, also defeating another UMass duo 6-0.
“We’ve been trying out some new teams and we put in some first-years which is exciting,” said Gonzalez of the doubles pairings. “Definitely going to keep working on [our doubles play], but it’s really exciting to see all of the success.”
The success kept coming on the singles court, where senior captain Lexi Milunovich rapidly took down her opponent in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. Gonzalez followed up with a victory, but it was freshman Sophia Ho who eventually secured the Crimson triumph, winning against her opponent, 6-2, 6-0.
“Our team is very young, so it’s nice to see everyone stepping up. It obviously bodes well for future years as well,” Gonzalez said.
The captain also noted that, because of the experience gained from the fall matches and the time the team has spent together off the court since the start of the school year, the squad has grown very close, making it much easier to stay focused and keep rattling off victories.
“We’re still taking everything match-by-match, and everyone has certain little things in their game that they’re working on improving,” Gonzalez said.
Next up for the Harvard women is the ECAC tournament in New York City, where they look to continue their hot streak coming in as the number one seed.
MEN’S TENNIS
The Crimson men (6-0, 0-0 Ivy League) entered Sunday with an abundance of momentum but faced one of their biggest threats yet to their undefeated streak with a home double-header. But even with the extended playing time, Harvard refused to slow down.
Earlier Sunday afternoon, the Crimson men faced off against the Rice University Owls. After dropping doubles in the previous two matches against BYU and Minnesota, Harvard was keen on securing the early point against the Owls. The duo of first-years Henry von der Schulenberg and junior Robert Wrzesinski defeated a Rice duo in a decisive 6-4 win, and first-year Ronan Jachuck and sophomore Brian Shi helped to secure the point on the first court with a 6-2 win.
“We’ve been trying to be more aggressive at the net and take more chances,” said freshman Alan Yim in regards to doubles play. “I think we’ve also been getting more comfortable with our partners. We’ve been rusty on a few skills, but after this week of practice, our work is starting to show on the court. Seeing anyone up on a court, especially after winning the doubles point, is a huge confidence booster and takes a lot of pressure off guys.”
The Harvard men continued their dominance through singles play, sweeping every single matchup en route to a 7-0 win, after Jachucks 6-3, 6-2 win to clinch the match.
“The older guys have been really good mentors to us freshmen. They’ve brought a really high level of energy to practice so that when we go into matches, we’re ready,” Yim said.
Later on in the day, the Crimson faced off against Bryant University. Even with only a modest amount of time between the matches, the Harvard men came out firing.
“We only had an hour break [in between matches], so we just relaxed, had some food, laughed a bit and then went back out on the court to warm-up again,” von der Schulenberg said. “It’s a short break, but it helps to stay focused. Having too long a break can put you off.”
Once again, the Crimson secured the doubles point, this time with a duo of von der Schulenberg and senior captain Logan Weber winning by a score of 6-0, and another pairing of sophomore Steven Sun and sophomore Harris Walker securing the point with a win by a score of 6-2.
Starting off singles play, von der Schulenberg scored the second point for Harvard, finishing with a statement 6-0, 6-1 win, followed by Walker and Jachuck shortly shutting the door on the match with 6-2, 6-0 and 6-2, 6-1 wins, respectively.
“At the start of the season, we wanted to take things match-by-match,” von der Schulenberg said. “But now we’re more motivated and ready to go to Nashville [for the next match] and then the week after we have our ECACs, which has been one of our season goals to win.”
The Crimson look to keep it rolling in the coming weeks, and if the future matches are anything like the past few matches, it is hard to imagine the team slowing down anytime soon.

Walking through the doors of the MAC and Hemenway can feel empowering and welcoming. “Empowering” in the sense that you can head back to your room after your “workout” (aka snapchatting mirror selfies in your workout clothing), and “welcoming” in the sense that these two gyms are sure to embrace you by enveloping your body in sweaty air — a literal warm hug. But sometimes, or most of the time, if we’re being real, our experiences at the MAC and Hem can feel like a battle with fellow gym-goers over the limited space and few machines. It’s like you need to build up strength and endurance to go in the first place. So, to make the gym experience more enjoyable for us all, let’s stick to the following guidelines:
1. Recognize that there’s limited space. Yes, maybe at home your gym allows for you to sprawl out and even make your own obstacle course, but that is a luxury that doesn’t exist within the walls of the MAC or Hem. So instead of monopolizing the 10-square-feet designated for 50 people, go grab a mat like everybody else and stay in your lane.
2. Sharing is caring. And if you didn’t realize, that small area for floor-work wasn’t meant for your own personal training space. If we join you in that area, don’t tell us to move over. You should.
3. Jump rope with caution. How is it possible that we even need to bring this up? Small spaces, lots of people, and jump ropes are a recipe for disaster.
4. Please clean up after yourself. There are wipes and spray for a reason. Just because you might enjoy working out in the literal midst of others’ sweat does not mean that everyone else does. And also, that spray smells really good. Like grape candy. Yum.
5. There are only three Pelotons. Having any number of Pelotons is a luxury, no doubt, so we don’t want to complain. But there are only three of them. So after you are done with your 60-minute Hip-Hop remix ride with arms and intervals, please don’t sit on the bike texting (or snapchatting...we see you taking those selfies!) because there’s a line waiting behind you.
6. Don’t look at us while we’re doing weights. It’s awkward for us. It’s awkward for you. Don’t do it. Look away.
7. We’re not competing. Harvard is already a pretty intense place, so let’s make the gym a competition-free zone. As mentioned above, stop looking over at that guy from math class who is doing some heavy chest pressing. You are your own competition.
