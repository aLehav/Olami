After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Chapter of academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa has been celebrating academic excellence since it admitted four juniors in 1781. Its alumni include such notables as Walter Lippmann, class of 1910, Henry A. Kissinger ’50, Ben S. Bernanke ’74, and John H. Updike ’54. Last Thursday, the Harvard chapter of PBK announced the names of this year’s “Junior 24.” While about 10 percent of each graduating class is ultimately inducted, every year the 48 juniors with the highest grade point averages are invited to apply for early admissionto the prestigious academic honor society. Of those 48 students, two dozen are inducted as juniors. In selecting the “Junior 24,” PBK is known to look for rigorous, diverse coursework as well as outstanding academic performance.To be named a member of this tiny group at such a competitive school is naturally a tremendous accomplishment, and these two-dozen students merit congratulation for their academic and intellectual achievements.
It’s common knowledge that Harvard students care hugely, inordinately in the eyes of some, about their grades. For many of us, the difference between an A and an A-minus or, God forbid, an A-minus and B-plus can mean the difference between a strong sense of accomplishment and extreme disappointment. Much of this outsize emphasis on grades stems, no doubt, from the highly competitive and driven personality types that helped most students gain admission to a school like Harvard in the first place. This sense of drive is then clearly compounded by the brutally competitive application processes at top medical and law schools.
An unfortunate side effect of this pressure to maintain extraordinarily high grade point averages is the temptation to err on the side of less challenging course loads. In an ideal world, all college students would challenge themselves to the fullest of their capabilities, determined that they squeeze as much knowledge and intellectual advancement out of these four years as possible. Yet the focus on achieving top grades, not to mention the odd bout of laziness felt by many undergraduates, places subtle pressure on students’ shoulders to take the easier fourth class or the risk-free Gen Ed. This amounts to a clear moral hazard: the temptation to do well by staying within our comfort zones, and perhaps even occasionally stooping below them.
In the case of the Junior 24, however, such moral hazard does not come into play. Even if one started out freshman year with the sole intent of securing a spot in this prestigious group, it is very likely that one would succeed. The standard of academic accomplishment is so high—“all As with maybe two A-minuses” in the words of Harvard PBK President Logan S. McCarty ’96—that it cannot reasonably be achieved by gaming the system. What’s more, PBK takes into account the diversity and types of classes taken by applicants. As a result, inclusion in the Junior 24 comes almost certainly as a result of extreme ability and rigorous engagement, as opposed to clever curriculum planning.
For others, the GPA system and the competitiveness of post-college applications and positions no doubt create a distorted incentive structure. Not that this means we could or should abandon how we recognize academic achievement. For all of the GPA’s faults there seems to be no ready replacement, and it should still serve as a good indicator of a student’s academic achievement. It is important, rather, to recognize that the ultimate prize of a Harvard education is intellectual growth, not an impressive three-digit number. Clearly, PBK’s annual Junior 24 exhibit precisely the academic passion that we ought to celebrate at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past four years, I have been a member a non-profit organization dedicated to fighting mesothelioma, a rare cancer that my father passed away from. As a member, I travel every June to Capitol Hill with an advocacy group to lobby for increased mesothelioma funding and awareness. With the semester coming to a close and summer fast approaching, I have begun to look forward to this annual summer activity. Alongside this anticipation, however, comes an all-too-familiar frustration that this summer will be just like the last, and that members of Congress will remain largely unreceptive to my requests.
Based on personal experience, although many senators and congressmenon the Hill are open to listening to an advocacy group for the allotted fifteen-minute time slot, it is impossible to ensure that theywill retain the information presented to them, or that the promises they make will in fact come to fruition.Even if the group is fortunate enough to actually meet with the senators or congressmendirectly, instead of the usual inattentive representative, there is still a slim chance of instigating action.
This is not to say that all lobbying efforts prove unsuccessful or that advocates like myself will always wind up talking to representativeswho care more about what is being served in the cafeteria than their constituents’ issues. It is to say, rather, that there seem to be vital flaws in our political system that severely limit many advocacy efforts.
The real issue with the system, and perhaps the issue responsible for the recurrent glazed look in the representatives’ eyes, is that the policies of politicians are not often subject to change. Too often they are decided ahead of time by strict adherence to the party line or the behind-the-scenes quid pro quo of the cloakroom.Seeing as it is exceedingly difficult for advocacy groups to altera politician’s stance, it is instead necessary to rely on more subtle tactics. This system can, in fact, be manipulated so long as advocacy groups implement a strategy. Their aim must be to emphasize their personal afflictions as a result of their cause, while at the same time remaining succinct and polished in their delivery.
Judging from my previousendeavors, the most effective lobbying tactic is to connect with a representative or politician on a personal level. Simply put, sympathy sells. In a world filled with staunch political figures, one often forgets that politicians possess emotions that, when appealed to, can incite greater change than a presentation of statistics or data. For example, when asked back in 2011 why he supported the mandatory administration of a cervical cancer vaccine to sixth-grade girls in Texas, Governor Rick Perry answered, “I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had Stage 4 cervical cancer.”Despite the controversyraised by this issue and Perry’s later decision to rescind the mandate, the governor’s actions served as proof of the effectiveness of persuasive lobbying tactics.
Relying on the sympathy card alone, however, does not ensure that one’s issues are placed at the forefront of a politician’s agenda. The constant recitation of my personal experience with family loss due to mesothelioma, for instance,did not immediately result in increased funding or a ban on asbestos, its cause. Concision and professionalism are also key. If politicians are only human, then they are undoubtedly influenced by the conduct and physical appearance of a lobbyist or advocacy group. It is imperative, therefore, to dispel the herd of activists clad in their organization’s paraphernalia in favor of a select few polished lobbyists who are dressed professionally and relay their stories with concision.
In essence, although the central aim of advocacy efforts is to cause political change, one must first conform to this sphere in order to have any influence on it. Just as the politicians’ lack of policy flexibility is deliberate (in many cases, it is necessaryin order to succeed in getting reelected), the efficacy of an advocacy group must lie in a deliberatestrategy of personalization, concision, and professionalism. When all is said and done, one must play by the rules in order to change them.
Even with lobbying tactics firmly established, however, there is still reason to question the value of advocacy and lobbying as a whole. As a process heavily reliant on strategy, advocacy runs the risk of having itstacticscome to nought. Despite whatever unpromising odds a lobbying group may face, there exists great promise in their ability to induce change. Even an advocacy group such as mine, whichlobbies for a cancer whose rarity has resulted in a diminutive amount of public knowledge, can never predict when our efforts will be met with receptivity and optimism. One visit may be all it takes to achieve a desired response. As a result, our presence on Capitol Hill has never diminished, and will never diminish, until our demands are met to the fullest extent. For while sympathy, concision, and professionalism are vital components of the lobbying process, perseverance is the fundamental element of an effective advocacy campaign.

To the editor:
Last week, in the article “Sex and Sexism,” Emily Unger and Rachel Zax made disparaging attacks on True Love Revolution. In short, they claim that TLR seeks to “demean and disparage women.” However, their op-ed completely distorts TLR’s positions and message. Furthermore, their criticisms of our poster campaign and our approach to dialogue on campus are equally unfounded.
Contrary to the allegations of sexism, at the heart and opening statement of TLR’s platform is “the inherent dignity of every human.” Our platform also clearly states that the differences between men and women “do not evidence the superiority of one sex over the other.”  Yet the authors seem to believe that we contribute to a “troubling national attitude that misunderstands and demeans women and sexuality.” Unger and Zax have badly misinterpreted our message to create a double standard that we feel would be harmful to both men and women. Instead of making a case for their own views on women and sexuality, they have resorted to misrepresenting positions contrary to their own. As stated in our platform, sexual integrity is important for “both the parties involved and to their relationship.” True Love Revolution exists to promote this very message.  To suggest that we promote premarital abstinence for women only is either a dishonest or a careless twisting of our beliefs and mission.
The authors also protest our use of a statistic in a recent poster campaign: “Women who had their first sexual encounter prior to their first marriage have been shown to be about 34 percent more likely to experience marital dissolution.” They call us “intellectually dishonest” for presenting a “misleading statistic,” claiming that our statistic unfairly conflates correlation and causation and that “a randomized, controlled study would be the only way to demonstrate such causality.” However, observational studies can be used to argue for causal outcomes. The racial education gap and education policies such as Teach for America, for instance, are based upon observational studies. Scholars can’t randomly assign children different education outcomes at birth, the same way that scholars cannot randomly assign all people different sexual decisions. In such studies (in our case, a survey that questioned women), scholars control for differences among populations and samples, examine their data, and make an argument based on their results.  In this case, those results make clear that successful marriages tend to follow lifestyles of sexual integrity. While Unger and Zax sought to expose our “poor understanding of statistics,” they instead revealed their own poor understanding of our argument.
Finally, Unger and Zax call into question our commitment to honest, intellectual dialogue in making the case for premarital abstinence and sexual integrity. Yet since True Love Revolution’s inception, we have written many articles, participated in debates, and invited speakers to campus to promote discourse on these contentious issues. For example, today we are honored to host Dr. Jennifer Roback Morse, president and founder of the Ruth Institute, who will be discussing her book “Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hookup World.”  We invite Unger, Zax, and anyone else with an interest in discussing these issues to attend Dr. Morse’s presentation today, Thursday, March 29, 2012 from 6:00-7:30 PM in Harvard Hall 202.
Sincerely,
Luciana E. Milano ’14
President, True Love Revolution

Matthew Vines ’12 was undoubtedly the smartest kid in my Social Studies 10 section. Every week he tackled the material with energy and verve, and effortlessly raised the interest level of everyone else in the room. Then, halfway through the year long tutorial, Vines took a leave of absence. On a brief return to Harvard the following semester, Vines implied that he had been suffering from depression, and said that he had decided to take time off to do some necessary “reading.”
Last week, I discovered what that “reading” was.
“I am gay,” Vines said to a Methodist church in his native Wichita, Kansas earlier this month, in an hour-long speech later posted to YouTube. And “according to the traditional interpretation of Scripture, as a Christian, I am uniquely excluded from [the] possibility for love, for companionship, and for family.”
For the past two years, Vines has dedicated his life solely to studying traditional Christian exegesis, in order to create a reasonable interpretation of the Bible’s stance on homosexuality that could replace the austere orthodox one espoused by his community. And the devotion and intellectual honesty he evoked in his quest should serve as a paragon for anyone who seeks to effectuate change in the religious (or political) sphere.
Vines came to grips with his sexual orientation during his sophomore year of college. He found numerous allies at Harvard, but felt consistently rebuffed by the fact that many of them came from such different cultural and religious backgrounds than he did. One LGBT tutor, for example, responded to his plight by bemoaning the burden that religion often placed on its gay adherents. “Her attitude was basically ‘Matthew, religion isn’t worth it,’” Vines said. “And I was just like, ‘well, okay, but that’s not really helpful.’”
Vines returned home to Kansas after that semester and stayed there. He decided that he couldn’t complete his undergraduate degree until he discovered a way to square his sexual orientation with his faith. This ended up being harder than expected, since he was at a loss to find a comprehensive, cogent, single piece or argument that he felt did justice to the issue. “There were so many books written on this topic, there are so many websites,” Vines said, but virtually all of them “cu[t] corners in order to reach their desired conclusion.” Most of the genuine scholarship on this issue, Vines discovered, was inaccessible to the vast majority of Christians, and most of the popular literature wouldn’t persuade a mainstream conservative Christian—and, most importantly, persuade Matthew Vines.
So ever since March 2010, Vines has devoted his life to researching this topic. This involved reading myriad scholarly articles, teaching himself basic Greek, and even returning to Harvard briefly to study Latin. Only after thousands of hours of study did Vines finally feel comfortable enough to present his findings. “I really want to reclaim the Bible,” Vines told me, “and not have to do it in a way that’s manipulative of the text. And fortunately…I think that my arguments and my interpretations are actually more accurate historically and Biblically” than the traditional ones.
You can decide that for yourself—as a non-Christian, I have no stake in this issue. But I do have a stake in how religious debates are conducted in this country.
Far too often, public discourse on controversial religious issues devolves into shouting matches between skeptics and staunch traditionalists. When debating religious conservatives about contraception, abortion, and gay marriage, opponents typically frame the dispute as one between those who care about “equality and compassion,” versus those who prefer to hold “outdated” views on antiquated texts that bear no relevance for the modern day. Such a self-righteous position may flatter skeptics’ sense of superiority, but it has little chance of persuading the unconverted and affecting actual religious reform. Indeed, such attacks tend to lead to retrenchment by religious institutions that interpret these accusations as assaults by liberal society on their moral character, and then circle the wagons to protect their purity.
Having grown up in Wichita, Vines knew that. And as a deeply devout Christian, he refused to accept a Biblical interpretation that in some way “cut corners” in its approach simply for the sake of politics. LGBT advocates often “completely knock the Bible all together, or Christianity altogether,” Vines said. “That is so counterproductive to the goal here. Why on earth, when you’re dialoguing with people, would you take something extremely sacred to them” and degrade it?
This basic understanding permeates Vines’s speech, and is precisely what makes it so beautiful. It’s filled with reverence for those who adhere to the tradition—Vines among them—and attempts to make an argument within the framework that they hold dear. In the long run, Vines’s speech will probably create far more change on the ground than unconvincing apologetics or anti-Christian diatribes.
So take the time to watch this video (there’s a screening on campus this Saturday). Even if you’re not a Christian, even if you’re not very religious, and even if you disagree with Vines’s findings, his work serves as a beacon to those who seek a popular discourse on religion that is grounded in erudition, thoughtfulness, and dignity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard welcomed the Army Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps back to campus Wednesday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Army’s new office in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. The event marks another step in Harvard’s continuing effort to reestablish the University’s relationship with the armed forces after four decades in which the University did not formally recognize ROTC.
During the ceremony, Harvard’s Director of Army SROTC Lieutenant Colonel Timothy J. Hall announced that the Army will offer SROTC classes for freshmen on Harvard’s campus in the fall. Despite the University’s recognition of Naval ROTC last year, cadets in that program still must travel to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to take courses.
In recent years, the University refused to recognize ROTC because it said that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the policy that banned gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens from serving openly in the military—violated Harvard’s anti-discrimination policy.
“It’s my sincere hope that the last 13 months will be remembered as a time of dramatic and welcome change at Harvard, an era of renewal characterized by expanded opportunity,” said University President Drew G. Faust.
Speakers and attendees at the ceremony highlighted the significance of the rekindling of Harvard’s relationship with the armed forces and the importance of serving in the military as a form of public service.
“Harvard is proud to count among its alumni heroic solider-scholars who have combined thought and action in times of war and times of peace,” Faust said. “May the students who visit this space be inspired as those in our past have been by the highest ideals of the United States of America.”
Hall said he plans to expand Army SROTC’s presence on Harvard’s campus beyond the new space in the SOCH. In addition to the new classes in the fall, physical training will begin on Harvard’s campus this semester.
Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said that Harvard’s distance from MIT had in the past deterred some students who might have been interested in ROTC.
“The two-mile trek to MIT for our students was a distance not only physical but also metaphorical,” she said. “I believe today we create a space for our future civic leaders to form relationships with our future military leaders, deepening the perspective for all concerned.”
William J. K. Scopa ’15 said that the new offerings could spur more students to join SROTC.
“I’ve always wanted to be in the military. I am drawn to public service,” Scopa said. “Harvard students are a lot like that, and as they learn more about the program, they may be interested in joining.”
An assortment of senior Harvard administrators attended the event, alongside a cadre of cadets at the College and other military personnel.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that his office would look for applicants interested in ROTC during the admissions process.
Hall said that future participation in SROTC depends in part on the enthusiasm of students already enrolled in the program.
“We want people who will make the commitment,” Hall said. “We’ll reach out, but frankly, our best advocates are our students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Lucerito L. Ortiz ’10 was in high school, she never believed attending Harvard was a remote possibility. “I applied as a dare,” she reminisces.
“It was like, ‘Yeah right, Harvard,’” she recounts, sitting at her desk in the admissions office of Harvard College.
Across the country, students who might be Harvard material in the eyes of the admissions office remain unaware that Harvard could be an option for them. Some believe the Ivy League is for the rich. Others have only seen students from their high schools go on to college in their home state. For many, the image they envision as the typical Harvard student does not look like them.
The admissions office has drastically cut back on its spending on recruiting in recent years. Officers no longer put on information sessions in high schools.  Gone are the glossy viewbooks. But at least one goal has outweighed the office’s post-financial-crisis interest in saving money on recruiting.
The Office of Admissions still strives to ensure that when every talented high school student looks in the mirror, he or she sees a potential Harvard applicant.
Many students’ concerns about storied institutions like Harvard spring from anxieties or false impressions tied to race and ethnicity. To attract outstanding students from backgrounds that are underrepresented at Harvard, the College actively reaches out to minority students through the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program.
The effort, which has survived unscathed while many similar initiatives withered in the harsh financial climate of recent years, repays Harvard’s ongoing support with impressive results. Every year, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the UMRP contacts 75 to 90 percent of the minority students who eventually end up at Harvard. The program enjoys a high success rate as it aims to convince students of color that they would indeed look right in crimson.
MINORITY REPORT
UMRP is staffed by a paid team of student coordinators who encourage minority students from across the nation to apply to Harvard.
The process starts in the summer, when the admissions office receives a list from the College Board of rising seniors who identified themselves as minority students on the PSAT and agreed to be contacted by colleges. UMRP employees send introductory emails to these students to pique their interest in applying to Harvard.
Ortiz, who is now the assistant director of UMRP, declined to state the scores these students must attain to receive an email from Harvard. “We tend to target students who we feel can fall in an academic range that would be feasible, that would make them feasible and competitive applicants for Harvard,” she said.
The admissions office sends another email to these students in the fall to remind them of the early action application deadline.
During the summer and fall, UMRP staffers often act as long-distance guidance counselors. High school students who have been targeted by minority recruits can call the office to ask for assistance with their application process.
“Their concerns are not very different from everyone else’s: concerns about transitioning, about community, about extracurriculars, academic transitions, all those things,” Ortiz said.
But having a dedicated phone line for responding to those questions is helpful for the students on UMRP’s list. “The program’s purpose is to act as a support network for students who may not find these resources or this information elsewhere,” Ortiz said.
And in the first year since 2006 that Harvard offered two application options, early and regular, this support might have been especially welcome. The early admissions program was scrapped six years ago partly on the grounds that underrepresented groups, both racial and socioeconomic, tend not to have as much access to advisers who can help them prepare college applications in time for a Nov. 1 deadline.
Ortiz said that the UMRP also seeks to spread awareness about attending college in general for students who might not otherwise consider it. “For us, it’s not just about raising awareness about accessibility and affordability at Harvard. It’s also letting students know that other places like Harvard have similar programs,” she said.
BRINGING HARVARD HOME
Although budget cuts have mostly taken the admissions officers who once traveled to high schools off the roads, current students at the College serve as recruiters through the UMRP. Each year, the program picks roughly 10 to 12 students to travel to about 15 high schools near their hometowns during January break.
“I think it’s very powerful when students go back to their own neighborhoods,” Ortiz said. She said that a current student at the College who is from the region can often be a more compelling representative than an admissions officer or alumnus. “Harvard still carries a stereotype as an elite institution that’s only for extremely wealthy people or crazy geniuses.... The idea of having students staff the office is to break down those stereotypes and let them know that there are people of all different backgrounds of all different kinds of experiences.”
The students recruited by UMRP often attend high schools that lack robust college counseling programs. Though she said her office maps these recruiters’ itineraries based on the students’ own origins, not a set list of destinations, the UMRP typically sends students to major urban hubs such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles each year.
“We like to target schools that are not necessarily normally targeted by a lot of colleges or universities,” Ortiz said. However, she said that it is difficult to send students to very rural areas where schools are sparsely located.
UMRP Coordinator Ronnye C. Rutledge ’12 made a recruiting trip to her home state of Indiana during her freshman year. “It was for me an opportunity that I wished had been offered when I was a senior applying to Harvard,” she said. “One of the most fulfilling things about this job is breaking down a lot of these misconceptions.”
The face of Harvard is more varied than many imagine. Minorities including blacks, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans make up 40.6 percent of the current freshman class.
SPENDING ON SUPPORT
All these efforts, whether in Cambridge over the summer or on the road over winter break, cost money. The College has supported minority recruiting with undiminished funding.
According to Ortiz, the program’s budget has not been cut even while other initiatives have seen funding slashed. “It’s a priority. We want to make sure we provide the support that students need to be able to go through this process and possibly go here,” she said.
Fitzsimmons voiced the importance of the program in strengthening the overall class. “We work very hard to get the best pool we possibly can,” he said. “If you want to have a great student body, you really have to do this. You really have to reach out.”
Ortiz said that students would be tangibly affected were the UMRP to shrink. “When you start cutting programming, the first students and the students that most get hurt are low-income and minority students that don’t always have the support systems, the support networks, and the counseling to be able to navigate a very complex and complicated process,”  she said.
That support extends even after students receive their acceptance letters. In the spring, the UMRP shifts its focus to increasing the yield of minority students accepted to the College by reaching out to admitted students. Cultural organizations help the UMRP call accepted minority students at phone-a-thons and host them during Visitas, the College’s April visiting program for admitted students.
“A lot of the members want to make sure that Latino prefrosh get Latino hosts,” said Herbert B. Castillo ’14, the president of Fuerza Latina.
Ortiz explained the rationale behind this ethnicity-based housing: “We just try to make sure that students know that there are places here where they can fit in.”

People are not enjoying sex as much as they could be, Occidental College sociology professor Lisa Wade said at her talk “Sex Machines vs. Sex Objects: How Stereotypes Subvert Sexual Pleasure” on Wednesday.
Wade argued that sexual values imposed by mass media create “gendered sexual roles” that undermine the natural pleasure of intercourse.
The Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response invited Wade to speak as part of Harvard’s inaugural Sex Week.
“Sex sells,” said Wade as she showed scantily-clad, seductive women on advertisements for everything from socks to hearing aids to organ donation.
These ads, she said, sell specific versions of sex that are different for men and women.
She said men are taught certain rules: Have sex, have it with as many women as possible, and follow the “script.”
“You flirt with a woman, grab for butt first, then boobs, then you start going under the clothes,” said Wade, describing this script. “Men are given this role, told to act out this role, and if they don’t follow it, then they are considered different.”
Women, on the other hand, are more often objectified than empowered.
Women “learn that being the object of men’s desire is the most important role we have,” said Wade as she showed a promiscuous photograph of female Czech Parliament members. “Even if a woman is talented in some other way, she still needs to capitalize on her attractiveness.”
But being sexy is different from being sexual, Wade said. She summed up masculine sexuality with the sentiment “I want” and feminine sexuality with the sentiment “I want to be wanted.”
Women may be anxious about their entire bodies during sex, Wade said, while men are typically self-conscious about just one part—the penis.
“We have really rigid demands for the penis,” said Wade, drawing laughter from the crowd.
The penis not only has to be large, she said, but it also has to produce a perfectly hard and long-lasting erection at any time. Furthermore, she said, “their ejaculation should reach outer space.”
But Wade said that 25 percent of college-age men have trouble getting an erection, and average sexual intercourse lasts three to seven minutes.
In addition, she said that women are so preoccupied with how their bodies look during sex that it detracts from their pleasure and that three quarters of women do not have orgasms during sex.
“Women who have sex with women orgasm 83 percent of the time, but only a third of that with men,” said Wade, eliciting a gasp from the audience. “Seventy-two percent of women fake orgasm, and even more so if in love, because they don’t want to disappoint him.”
Attendee Lynne S. Peskoe ’14 said she enjoyed the talk. “It was really informative and well-done in terms of not being preachy.”
Roberto A. Perez ’15 won a mini-vibrator in a raffle at the end of the event. He said he plans to “use it as a massager.”
Wade ended with a few words of advice: “Men, remember that you are more than a penis. Women, don’t equate sexiness with attractiveness. Everyone: broaden your view of what is sexy. Most importantly, talk to one another—it can open up another dimension of sex.”

Journalist Anthony Shadid’s courage, precision, and empathy for his subjects made him one of the most prominent and well-respected Middle East correspondents of his generation, colleagues said Tuesday at a memorial event at the Harvard Bookstore. Shadid died in February in Syria after suffering an asthma attack while reporting in the Middle East for The New York Times.
Shadid—a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist—worked as a foreign correspondent for the Associated Press, The Boston Globe, and The Washington Post. While reporting from the West Bank in 2002, he was shot in the shoulder.
Charles M. Sennott, the executive editor and vice president of GlobalPost, recalled that the journalist maintained his calm and professionalism even while injured.
“What amazed me on the telephone with Anthony, and he’s in terrible pain and sedated, was that every fact was lined up. Everything was precise,” Sennott said.
Noting that Shadid refused to be transferred from his hospital in Ramallah to a better facility out of fear that his Palestinian translator would be abandoned and imprisoned, Sennott said, “He was careful, but fearless.”
Philip F. Bennett ’81, the managing editor of Frontline who served as Shadid’s editor at The Washington Post, recalled a conversation with Shadid on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq in March 2003. During the call, Shadid told Bennett he was going to remain in country even as the Post withdrew its correspondents from Baghdad.
“The louder the event, the quieter the writing. The more tumultuous the event, the calmer his voice would be,” Bennett said.
He recalled that Shadid told him, “I realize you might have to fire me, but I’m not leaving.”
Bennett said that Shadid’s focus on each individual as an integral part of the broader picture of current affairs was one of his greatest strengths as a journalist.
“What Anthony did in Iraq and elsewhere was he moved people from the margins of the story to the center of the story. He did something we all aspire to as journalists—he turned the ‘other’ into ‘us,’” Bennett said.
Shadid’s empathy for his subjects and his deep cultural, historical, and political knowledge of the region was due in part to his own musings on his identity as an American of Lebanese descent, said Susan D. Chira ’80, assistant managing editor for news at The New York Times and a former Crimson president.
For family friend Nayla Daly, who said she remembered Shadid as kind and down-to-earth, hearing from her friend’s colleagues from the field at the Harvard Book Store event was especially moving.
“It’s just amazing to see the power of journalism behind him,” she said.
“I think he has brought such a different face to what the Middle East is,” she continued. “It’s what American journalism needed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“It is so good to be back home,” said Geoffrey Canada, a leader in education and a 1975 graduate of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, to an auditorium of students and community members on Wednesday.
Canada was the recipient this year’s Medal for Education Impact, the highest honor given by the Ed School.
During his lecture following the award presentation, Canada inspired laughs from Ed School students as he joked about the campus and his other experiences while he pursuing a master’s degree.
“I don’t usually talk about this part of my career. In many ways, there have been powerful forces shaping my own career, and a lot of those forces came from here,” Canada said.
Canada recalled his relationship with Bruce P. Baker ’57, his professor for a behavior modification class whom he credited with teaching him that every child is capable of learning and demonstrating the importance of building strong educational leaders.
“To see someone who can say ‘Watch me do it,’ it forever changed me. I never doubted it again,” Canada said.
After graduating from the Ed School, Canada worked at Robert White School in Boston while working to apply scientific data to education.
He later founded the Harlem Children’s Zone, a nonprofit organization that strives to provide educational resources, social services, and other forms of support to low-income children and families.
“I love Geoff. He’s someone who has actually done it,” said Robert Kegan, a professor at the Ed School who once taught Canada.
Canada warned audience members that they may face challenges in their attempts to reform educational institutions. He said that the public tends to demonize people who try to innovate.
He shared stories of obstacles he has faced during his career in education reform, from speaking with White House officials to teaching in an all-white classroom at the Robert White School at a time when the school was segregated.
“It was nice to hear such an influential leader say that and knowing that he had to weather that,” said Julie K. Dlugokecki, a master’s student at the Ed School.
Canada called for a generation of advocates to hold educators accountable and to get “rid of lousy teachers,” an idea that has sparked controversy in the field. He closed his address by reciting a poem about accountability he had written and memorized, entitled, “Don’t Blame Me.”
The Medal for Education Impact honors an educator who advances the Ed School’s mission to improvement student opportunity, achievement, and success, said Dean of the Ed School Kathleen McCarthy.
“He is one of the best friends children could have,” McCarthy said of Canada.

Harvard professors and Allston residents have expressed support for the construction of an arts and culture center or performing arts space near Barry’s Corner since community members revived discussion about the creation of such a center at a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting last week.
While University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 did not say whether the University plans to pursue the development of such a center, he expressed excitement about the expansion of arts in Allston.
Mentioning arts-related institutions already popping up on Harvard-owned property in Allston, Garber said, “An arts community is growing.... That can be a nucleus for all kinds of activities that people find exciting.”
In a 2007 planning document, Harvard proposed the construction of an arts and cultural center in Allston.
“A strong arts and culture presence will enliven the campus and provide public activities for Allston residents and the greater public,” the plan stated.
But financial constraints forced the University to postpone this project along with the development of the planned $1 billion dollar Science Complex and the creation of a “main street” environment on Western Ave. in Allston.
Visual and Environmental Studies Manager of Academic Programs Paula Soares spoke enthusiastically about the potential creation of more space for the arts.
“We have good space now,” she said.  “But space is just something that there’s never enough of.”
VES professor Giuliana Bruno emphasized the value of creating more art spaces which are accessible to the public.
“It’s crucial for Harvard art spaces to interact with people outside of the Harvard community,” she said.
Allston residents on the Task Force said they are eager for the University to resume planning an arts and culture site. They asserted that the current University plans for the Barry’s Corner area do not measure up to past visions of development.
“Harvard spent years talking to us about how arts and culture were a keystone of their expansion into Allston,” said Harry E. Mattison. “What they’re suggesting now for Barry’s Corner is not that attractive, especially when they were discussing arts or performance space before.”
The 2007 document proposed that the University move parts of the Harvard museum system to the site currently occupied by the Charlesview Apartments or establish new performance buildings in the Barry’s Corner area, which sits on the corner of Western Ave. and North Harvard St.
Paul Berkeley seconded Mattison’s sentiment. Berkeley said that Harvard should no longer focus on filling its lots with commercial properties and should instead “start thinking about bigger and better things.”
“We’ve got enough restaurants, bars, and pizza places—we’ve got to go outside of that,” he said.  “This is a neighborhood of working-class people who would really appreciate access to an art space or a performance space.”
Brent C. Whelan ’73 said that an art and culture center would be an ideal way for Harvard to demonstrate its commitment to Allston’s residents.
“The idea is for Barry’s Corner to be a place that is shared by University people and community people,” Whelan said.  “Arts and the performing arts would really serve both constituencies.”
Kevin Casey, Harvard associate vice president for public affairs and communication, said that the University was pleased to receive feedback from Allston residents.
“[We] will take those thoughts and concerns into account as Harvard advances site assessment and academic planning,” Casey wrote in an email after last Tuesday’s meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three doctors from Brigham and Women’s Hospital spoke Wednesday night on how they balanced their medical careers and personal lives.
The panel, hosted by the Harvard College Kidney Disease Screening and Awareness Program, included three colleagues in the hospital’s renal division—Jennifer E. Flythe, Connie M. Rhee, and Emily S. Robinson.
Despite the challenges they have faced, the panelists assured the audience of nearly 40 students that it is possible to navigate intense medical training programs while building a family.
“Even when you have families or other complications, you just do it,” Flythe said.
The panelists took questions for more than an hour and offered anecdotes about their own experiences in medical school and residency. The doctors discussed the decisions they were forced to make during their careers when their training conflicted with family plans.
“It can be very difficult [with a spouse] to match two careers,” said Flythe.
The students in attendance shared similar concerns as they consider careers in the medical field.
“I think it’s good that we had this panel to bring in doctors at different stages in their careers to hear about not only their work, but also how their family life comes into play as well,” said neurobiology concentrator Christine L. Shrock ’13.
Some students attended looking specifically to hear the perspectives of women in the medical field.
“I wanted to see how other women have balanced having a spouse and kids while pursuing a career,” said Marjorie N. Odegard ’13.
The panelists also discussed their paths to the renal division at Brigham and Women’s.
“As you move further along in your training, your options open up in terms of where you attend,” said Rhee.
All three doctors spent their residencies at different hospitals, but their mutual interest in kidney disease lead them to Brigham and Women’s.
Mari E. Tanaka ’13, the panel’s moderator, emphasized the importance of informing students about kidney disease. In addition to hosting events such as the advising panel, the Kidney Disease Screening and Awarness Program which sponsored the event also provides free health screenings and organizes community-based education programs on chronic kidney disease.

The Faculty of Arts Sciences launched its “Great Teachers” video series Wednesday, a project which highlights pedagogy in video clips that showcase the teaching methods of prominent professors across the University.
“What we want to capture in this series and bring to the world is the excitement of intellectual inquiry in Harvard’s classrooms,” said Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds.
The videos, which range from a few minutes to more than an hour in length, include interviews with featured professors, their students, and their colleagues. In some cases, the videos also include full-length samples of the faculty members’ undergraduate lectures.
“We hope these videos will illustrate for viewers the type of exciting and important conversations that happen here every day between our faculty and students,” said FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
The initial videos produced by the project—which was created in concert with Harvard’s 375th anniversary—features four faculty members: physics and history of science professor Peter L. Galison ’77, physics professor Lisa Randall ’84, music professor Thomas F. Kelly, and law professor Jonathan L. Zittrain.
Smith said that the program aims to feature two additional professors before the semester’s end and six more each semester in the years to come.
“People outside of Harvard sometimes don’t know how much effort goes into teaching here and how important teaching is here,” said Galison, whose course Science of the Physical Universe 17: “The Einstein Revolution,” is one of the lectures featured in the first batch of videos. “One of the goals is to show that—the variety and depth of teaching.”
Although the new video series is primarily directed at audiences outside of Harvard, including prospective students, Galison said that he hopes the new series will become a “shared resource” for Harvard faculty to gain exposure to the teaching of their colleagues.
“I hope they’ll be useful for us, to see how we variously approach teaching,” Galison said.
Created in collaboration with the Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, the video series is part of a broader effort by FAS to bring high-quality teaching to the forefront of the school’s mission.
Last October, FAS received a $40 million grant from Law School alumni Gustave M. and Rita E. Hauser to fund the Harvard Initiative on Learning and Teaching, which officially kicked off at a University-wide symposium in February,
In addition, Smith has cited teaching and learning as one of the school’s main priorities in the upcoming capital campaign.

The Undergraduate Council will host a school-wide dance party at Northwest Labs Friday night featuring mash-up artist 5 & A Dime and resident DJ of the club Royale Boston, DJ Breeazy.
The event, called Electric Labs, will be the first campus-wide event hosted by the Council since last April’s Lights Out party in Annenberg.
“This is new ground for the UC,” said Spenser R. Goodman ’14, chair of the UC’s Social Programs Committee. “After the College Events Board broke off from the UC in 2006, the UC is finally starting to dabble in events of this kind again.”
Representatives said that the event, with an expected attendance of 1,200 students, will make this lab and classroom building unrecognizable. To create a nightclub vibe, event organizers plan to use lasers, strobe lights, LED effect lights, and LED wash lights provided by Christian E. Chauvet ’12, whose family owns the light manufacturing company Chauvet Lighting.
“When students walk in, they won’t be able to recognize it,” said UC Social Programs Committee Vice Chair Francisco Triana ’13.
Mash-up artist 5 & A Dime, who will be performing at the event, will also be bringing an LED curtain for a light show. He and his opening act, DJ Breeazy, are known for their unique sound and high-energy performances.
“[5 & A Dime] was stoked to hear that he was going to perform in a lab,” said 5 & A Dime manager Maxwell H. Zotz. “He’s great when he performs live. He really gets into it, and he dances harder than anyone else.”
With several surprises lined up, representatives said that Northwest Labs will be an appropriate venue to host  the party. Upperclassmen will have access to the shuttle that regularly travels from the Quad to the Northwest Labs, and the UC has also a chartered a special bus service to run between Boylston Gate and Northwest Labs for the night.
“We’re going big on this event, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the place was packed,” Goodman said. “We don’t want to turn people away, so it’ll be important to get there early and on time.”
The UC will also be giving out sunglasses to the first 200 people in line and free glow sticks to everyone who attends.
“We’ve done everything to make this event as crazy as possible,” Triana said. “So get ready to party.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 29, 2012, at 6:22 p.m.
An all-time low 5.9 percent of applicants received offers to join Harvard College’s Class of 2016 on Thursday. This marks the sixth consecutive year that Harvard’s admission rate has fallen.
At 5 p.m., 1,260 students received notifications of their acceptance by email. In total, including the 772 students admitted in December in the early action acceptance round, a total of 2,032 initial offers, more than 100 fewer than last year, were extended to applicants. The admit rate for those considered under regular decision, including the 2,838 early action candidates who were deferred to the original round, was 3.8 percent.
This year’s accepted students were selected from an applicant pool of 34,302, down 1.9 percent from last year.
The percentage of black, Latino, and Native American students accepted to the class decreased slightly, while Asian Americans and Native Hawaiians were accepted at slightly higher rates.
Black students make up 10.2 percent of the accepted students, and 11.2 percent are Latino—down from last year’s 11.8 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively.
Ten percent of the accepted students hail from foreign countries.
More than 60 percent of students accepted this year will benefit from a record financial aid budget of $172 million; families receiving aid will pay an average of $12,000 of the total cost of Harvard undergraduate education, which next year will rise to nearly $55,000. Under the recently modified guidelines of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, students from families that earn less than $65,000 will attend Harvard at no cost.
“It’s a big commitment, and it’s aimed right at the people that need the money the most,” said Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
Last year, even with a slightly larger applicant pool, the acceptance rate was a bit higher, at 6.2 percent.
Fitzsimmons said in a press release that the return of early action admissions, discontinued at Harvard in 2006 and revived for the Class of 2016, made it more difficult for the admissions office to predict the number of students who will ultimately matriculate. Thus, officers were conservative in the number of students they accepted.
Furthermore, good press might spur accepted students to choose Harvard in higher-than-usual numbers. “There’s been some very, very good publicity about Harvard this year,” Fitzsimmons said.
“Not simply the Harvard basketball team and ‘Linsanity,’ but that’s certainly out there,” he added.
Harvard placed an unspecified number of students on the waitlist, and these students will receive notice of their status later in the spring. Fitzsimmons said that the office expects to admit more waitlisted students than usual this time around, since it was cautious in its initial offers.
With the emails sent and the letters in the mail, Fitzsimmons said the admissions office will now turn its focus to reaching out to admitted students.
“The most important thing is that students get to the right match,” Fitzsimmons said.
Admissions officers will send personal notes and make phone calls to admitted students, and alumni will host events for admitted students across the country and internationally.
All students, whether they were accepted in the early or regular cycle, must respond to their offers of admission by May 1.
Admission rates at some other Ivy League schools decreased as well this year. Yale’s admission rate was 6.8 percent, down from 7.4 percent last year, and Princeton’s dropped to 7.9 percent from last year’s record-low 8.5 percent.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 29, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard’s admissions rate dropped for the seventh consecutive year in 2012 for the Class of 2016. In fact, 2012 marked the sixth straight year in which the rate had fallen.

After a home run in the first inning against Holy Cross (11-10), the Harvard baseball team would not relinquish the lead. The Crimson defeated the Crusaders, 7-6, on Fitton Field Wednesday evening and improved its record to 2-16.
It was a welcome win for Harvard, which has lost 10 of its last 11 games by either one or two runs.
“It feels great,” senior pitcher Brent Suter said. “It kind of felt like these games were kind of the same story, where we got a lead and they’d come crawling back. But today we were able to stop it and come away with a W.”
It was senior designated hitter Marcus Way’s first home run of the season that gave Harvard the early edge, and it was exactly the type of start that the Crimson needed heading into the contest.
“Marcus has missed, I think, all but four games this whole year, so it was nice getting him back, nice for him to make a statement like that,” junior captain Andrew Ferreira said. “It definitely boosted the team’s confidence right away.”
After gaining a 1-0 lead, Harvard continued to add on the runs.
The Crimson scored four in the fourth inning, which began with a double down the left-field line by senior second baseman Jeff Reynolds. Reynolds eventually scored off of a single by sophomore left fielder Jack Colton. Freshman right fielder Zach Boden helped add another run, batting a single to give him an RBI.
The final two runs of the inning were batted in by junior first baseman Robert Wineski.
With two on and two out, Wineski laced a stand-up double down the left-field line, clearing the bases and extending Harvard’s lead, 5-0.
Harvard tacked on another two runs in the fifth inning. Reynolds, recording his second double of the day, made it to home plate off of a single by sophomore shortstop Carlton Bailey.
Bailey’s classmate Steven Dill, a catcher, also scored on a passed ball by his counterpart behind the plate, Stephen Wadsworth. The Crimson led, 7-0, at the end of the fifth.
The bottom of the same frame saw a resurgence from Holy Cross. With freshman Tanner Anderson on the mound for the Crimson, the Crusaders recorded six-straight hits and four unearned runs to get back into the game.
Anderson was the fifth of 10 total Harvard pitchers on the day, the win going to sophomore starter Baron Davis (1-1).
While the sixth inning saw no runners round the bases, the seventh was dangerous for Harvard.
With the bases loaded and two outs, Ferriera stepped out of the bullpen to get the Crimson out of a sticky situation. The Crusaders were able to score one run from an error by Wineski, but that was all Ferriera would allow. He went lights out for the rest of the inning, striking out two-consecutive batters and keeping the Crimson’s lead at two.
“I felt pretty good,” Ferriera said. “I just knew if I threw the ball over the plate, my defense was going to make plays for me. I wasn’t really too nervous—I was just trying to step up for my team.”
After a scoreless eighth frame for both teams, Harvard also went three-and-out in the top of the ninth.
But the pressure rose in the bottom of the final inning.
With Holy Cross’s Evan Ocello on base after hitting a single, Mike Ahmed made it to first from a throwing error by junior pitcher Joey Novak, advancing his teammate to second. A sacrifice bunt by Alex Maldonado put both Ocello and Ahmed in scoring position. Capitalizing on the situation, Chris Sintetos hit a single that sent Ocello home.
With one out in the ninth and Harvard winning, 7-6, Suter came to the mound to replace Novak.
“Honestly, I kind of told Coach to go with another guy instead of me at first because I was feeling a little stiff today,” Suter said. “The nerves were definitely going, but I knew we wanted this win really badly, so I just went out there and said, ‘Put the fear aside; let’s just get in the zone and see what happens.’ Fortunately, good things happened.”
Suter struck out the first batter he faced, and the game ended soon afterwards, when Sintetos was caught off the bag and tagged out in a pickle.
The win is crucial for the Crimson to gain momentum to carry into its opening Ivy League games this weekend.
“It definitely feels good and gets the momentum going into the weekend,” said Suter. “It’s a good feeling now, but we know we’re going to have to recharge and get out there again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When most people think of the Ivy League, they entertain thoughts of SAT prep classes and impossibly low admissions rates. Others may think of the Ivy League’s impressive list of alumni.
But for a small group of gamblers in Las Vegas, the Ivy League offers a chance to make a few bucks on Friday night during the college basketball season since the Ivy League is one of the only basketball conferences in the NCAA that plays on that day.
The Ancient Eight has retained this format since its inception in 1956 so that students miss as little class time as possible.
Many schools play basketball on Thursday nights, and an even greater number play on Saturdays. These are the nights when the 30 plus sports books in the most populous city in Nevada—where gambling on sports is legal, unlike in most states—receive the most bets. The teams that attract this large gambling traffic usually have Friday nights off, which leaves the three or four Ivy League games as the only college sports options for bettors.
Still, the Ivy League does not receive much attention in Las Vegas. One explanation is the increasing number of NBA games on Friday nights. But for the most part, the general public is simply uninterested in what transpires in Ancient Eight basketball, says to Jay Kornegay, the vice president of race and sports book operations at the Las Vegas Hotel and Casino Superbook.
As a result, only a small group of gamblers test their luck on the lines for Ancient Eight basketball.
“I don’t think a casual bettor is coming in to bet on a Harvard game,” says Sean Van Patten, oddsmaker at the Las Vegas Sports Consultants. “It’s probably more professionals: wiseguy-type action rather than Joe Schmoes. The same guy betting on the Heat vs. Knicks isn’t going to bet on a Harvard basketball game.”
“The casual sports watcher betting on $10 parlays probably isn’t going to have Harvard and Princeton on their ticket,” he adds.
It is unclear just how much money these “wise guys” are placing on Ivy League hoops. Kornegay estimates that it could be anywhere from $500 to $5,000, depending on the sports book, though the average is somewhere around $1,000.
Some sports books limit the money that can be placed on these games because of the lack of public money to balance the bet.
The professionals that Van Patten alludes to, unlike many gamblers in Las Vegas, do not place their bets on a whimsical hunch. Instead, they do detailed research to increase their chances of winning. Since Ivy League basketball is not as well publicized as other conferences, these bettors scour the net for information. Some go as far as reading college newspapers like The Crimson, according to a 2009 New York Times article.
“There is so much information on the web; you can look up anything,” Kornegay says. “Whether it’s Kentucky or Harvard, that’s where [the information is], and those guys will do their homework.”
“The average Joes…form their opinion based on [a team’s] national ranking or whether they saw it on TV or saw it in some sort of national coverage,” Kornegay adds. “A sharper player is going to dig a little deeper. They might look at who the team is playing, possible matchups, look at their front line, if they had two days rest, if their starters are 100 percent.  That’s the type of homework they do, and that homework is on the web.”
As Harvard basketball has found success in recent years, information on the once lowly program has become far more accessible. And with the team’s—and the league’s—rise, the perception of both is changing. That, in turn, is affecting bettors’ interest in the conference.
“The more coverage you get, whether it’s on ESPN or the web or major TV networks, is always going to [be reflected] at the betting windows,” Korengay explains. “It all depends on getting recognition nationally. The more you get, the more bets are going to be on those teams. Whether it’s Harvard or another team, the more successful teams in the Ivy League, the better.”
Right now, the Harvard basketball program is receiving plenty of national attention. The team has been mentioned more times on ESPN’s “SportsCenter” this year than at any point in recent memory. A number of factors contribute to this phenomenon, including a top-25 ranking for part of the season as well as an NCAA berth. The “LINsanity” coverage has also garnered more interest for Harvard at the sports books.
This increased media coverage of the Harvard basketball team has resulted in what Kornegay describes as a “minimal” spike in public betting on Ivy League games. Television might prolong this rise because it will allow casual gamblers to form an opinion on, and thus perhaps vest interest in, Ancient Eight games.
Van Patten agrees that television coverage plays a critical role in generating gambling interest.
“A game being on TV is always going to affect the handle on the sport,” Van Patten says. “People like to bet on what they can watch. They might not have a huge opinion on the game…but they might bet on the game just because it’s on TV and they can sit and root for it.”
Pretty soon, the gambling public may further invade the realm of Ivy League betting, a territory currently dominated by a small group of more serious bettors. If Harvard continues to play at a top-25 level, the Crimson will play more games on television in front of a national audience.
This past year, for example, Harvard played its first showcased game on ESPN2, on Dec. 8, when the team lost to the University of Connecticut on Dec. 8.  What’s more, the Crimson’s games against Boston College on Dec. 29 and Princeton on Feb. 11 were televised on ESPN3. A part of this spike in coverage can be attributed to the 2009 election of Robin Harris as head of the Ivy League athletic conference. In her brief tenure, Harris has spearheaded an effort to put more Ivy League games on television.
It is not unprecedented for the public perceptions of a conference to change in Vegas. According to Kornegay, George Mason University and Virginia Commonwealth University have altered how casual bettors view the Colonial Athletic Conference.
In 2006, George Mason advanced to the Final Four as a No.11 seed. The team’s success prompted national interest in the little-known Colonial Athletic Conference. Five years later, Virginia Commonwealth, also an 11 seed, made a run of its own to the Final Four.
Even though neither team won its Final Four game, both collected respect for the league.  Consequently, according to Kornegay, more gamblers are placing bets on the CAA because they are more familiar with the conference.
Harvard could make a similar impact on the Ivy League if it can make a deep run in the tournament and play at a consistent level.
If that happens, then more people might think of placing a Friday night bet when they hear the words “Ivy League.”

After a rough start to a season that launched with high expectations, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team appears to be turning a corner.
The Crimson (4-4, 1-2 Ivy) put together its first winning streak of the 2012 season, downing Stanford, 10-4, Wednesday afternoon at Harvard Stadium for its second straight victory.
Harvard, which saw another standout performance from rookie goalkeeper Kelly Weiss (eight saves, four goals allowed), dominated from start to finish, taking an early 3-0 lead before going up by as many as nine in the second half. And if it hadn’t been for three Cardinal (2-6) goals in the final four minutes of play with the game’s outcome already well decided, it would have been the Crimson’s most dominant defensive performance since blanking Boston University, 11-0, in 2002.
“Another good defensive effort,” said Harvard coach Lisa Miller, whose squad has held its opponent to single digits for the fourth straight game. “[The defense] limited the shots on Kelly, and when the shots did come, Kelly made saves.”
Weiss, who has started in net for the Crimson since day one, finished with more saves than goals allowed for the third straight game. Weiss entered Wednesday’s contest ranked 24th in the nation in save percentage.
“She’s been a huge bonus,” Miller said. “She has all the things that you want from a goalkeeper that’s capable of taking you into [the] championships.”
“She’s been playing huge,” added junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault, who finished with one goal and three draw controls. “She’s really helping our defense and coming up with saves in times of need.”
On offense the Crimson was led by junior attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen who finished with a season-high four goals. After leading the Ivy League in scoring in both her freshman and sophomore seasons, VanderMeulen has struggled finding the back of the net in 2012, scoring just seven goals in the Crimson’s first seven games.
But on Wednesday, the VanderMeulen of old returned, scoring a game-high four times on five shots.
Five other Harvard players found the back of the net, taking advantage of Stanford keeper Lyndsey Munoz, who stopped just three of the 13 shots she faced.
VanderMeulen gave the Crimson an early lead, capitalizing on a free-position shot 2:45 into play. Tetreault posted her 12th goal of the year less than two minutes later, and VanderMeulen followed with her second score to put the Crimson ahead, 3-0, less than five minutes into play.
“We played really well in spurts,” Miller said. “I thought we got off to a really quick start.”
Harvard’s lead only grew from there. After 20 minutes of scoreless play, junior attacker Micaela Cyr tacked on the Crimson’s fourth score. The junior broke free from her defender and cut to the front of the net where she received a pass from sophomore Jenn Leffew and flung the ball past Munoz.
Leffew added one more score before the end of the period, taking a pass from co-captain Melanie Baskind behind the cage and curling around the goal before firing the ball into the net.
Leffew’s score, her third of the year, put the Crimson ahead, 5-0, heading into the break. Baskind connected with Leffew again less than four minutes into the second frame, this time finding the sophomore open in front of the net. Leffew took the pass and finished to give Harvard a 6-0 lead.
Baskind added a score of her own less than two minutes later, spinning off her defender and firing a shot into the corner of the net.
After nearly 40 minutes of play, Hannah Farr brought an end to the Cardinal shutout. Farr got free in front of the Crimson net and snuck one past Weiss to pull Stanford within six, 7-1.
But Harvard’s defense clamped down over the next 15 minutes of play, holding the visitors scoreless during that time.
“We’re a very athletic team, and defense is all about helping,” Tetreault said. “If we understand the system and we’re helping, we’re going to play good defense.”
With the Crimson in control defensively, sophomore Chelsey Newman scored and VanderMeulen added to more to give Harvard a 10-1 lead with 14:27 to play.
The Cardinal tacked on three scores in the final 4:01 to pull within six, 10-4.

Dear Harvard community,
On behalf of our basketball program, I want to sincerely thank you once again for the incredible support that you gave to our team this year, for helping us to win our 2nd Ivy League Championship and our first NCAA Tournament appearance of the modern era! To the band, cheer teams, faculty, staff and all members of the Harvard community, THANK YOU!
A very special THANK YOU to our students—who are truly an integral part of our team! They continue to fight for our team in a classy manner that is truly representative of this great institution. I continue to be very proud of what you do—and how you do it.
We had another historic year in many ways, but we were especially proud of our record at home—11-1—in Lavietes Pavilion. And we have you to thank for it once again! We couldn’t have done it without you.
Congratulations!! Thank you!! And Go Crimson!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The awards keep pouring in for Harvard men's basketball coach Tommy Amaker.
Last week, Amaker was named the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Coach of the Year for District 13, which composes New England.  That distinction came just days after he was tabbed as the United States Basketball Writers Association of America (USBWA) District I Coach of the Year.
Amaker is also a nominee for two prestigious coaching awards that will be announced this weekend. He is one of 21 finalists for the Ben Jobe Award, given annually to the top minority coach in Division I men’s basketball and is also one of 21 finalists for the Hugh Durham Award, presented each year to the top mid-major coach in Division I.
Both honors will be announced Friday at the CollegeInsider.com awards banquet in New Orleans, La. on the eve of the Final Four.
Amaker insisted this week that the honors were a reflection of the job done by those around him.
“[They’re] a direct result of our staff and certainly of the play of our players,” Amaker said. “We use those things as group acknowledgements, and I think our staff has done a tremendous job during their entire time here, and this past season in particular, and I was proud of our group.”
“It’s nice sometimes those [honors] can come our way—not my way, but our way,” he added. “That’s the result of what these kids have done on the floor.”
After leading Harvard to a 26-5 record, an appearance in the Top 25, and its first NCAA tournament berth in 66 years this season, Amaker’s name has again been linked to major-conference jobs, just as it was last year.
But the award-laden coach again insisted this week that he had no plans to leave Lavietes Pavilion anytime soon.
“As I’ve said before, we’re very happy here, and I’m hopeful that we’ll be at Harvard for many, many years to come,” Amaker said. “I’m not pursuing anything. We’re getting ready for next year, we’re getting ready for recruiting, and as I said, my heart’s at Harvard, and I hope to be here for a long time.”

Harvard often faces the challenge of becoming overly accustomed to praise, regularly occupying the top few spaces of worldwide university rankings. However, a recent article in the Huffington Post shows that ranking high is not always a good thing, at least according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE).
Results from a study by the FIRE name Harvard as one of the "12 Worst Colleges for Free Speech In 2012". Based on the University's actions over the past year, the FIRE has found multiple faults in the university's support of free speech. Their reasons include Harvard's freshman pledge, which they believe limits academic freedom, the prevention of Yale students from designing Game Day shirts with the names of famous drop-outs Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, and the effective dismissal of former summer school instructor Subramanian Swamy. Swamy wrote an inflammatory op-ed in 2011 that called for, among many things, the destruction of Indian mosques and the prohibition of conversion from Hinduism.
If you're interested in discussing free speech at Harvard in more detail, Sunday April 1 marks the beginning of Free Speech Week, a national event pioneered by the student group Students For Liberty. The Harvard Libertarian Forum invites all Harvard students to the Science Center Plaza each day next week. Paper and pens will be available for students to make uncensored, unadulterated and untamed statements about the world. These messages will then be showcased on a wall, which will be erected for the occasion.
Other schools listed in the top 12 include Yale, Johns Hopkins, Tufts and Brandeis.

Which has more brand recognition: Coca-Cola or Harvard?

According to professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68, "There have been times when people did more talking about Harvard than Coke as a brand."
This week, FM's scrutiny explores an evolving Harvard brand composed of varying attributes, some of which still reflect qualities at odds with what the University experience has become for many students. Don't have time to read the full article? Check out the video instead!
