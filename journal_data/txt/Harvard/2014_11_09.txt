After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 9, 2014, at 10:02 p.m.
Yale faculty voted “overwhelmingly” Thursday to bring Harvard’s most popular undergraduate course, Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” to New Haven in the fall of 2015, according to Yale Computer Science Department Chair Joan Feigenbaum ’81.
The course proposal was already approved on Oct. 16 by Yale’s Course of Study Committee for a three-year trial period, but the vote at the monthly faculty meeting officially completes the approval process on Yale’s end.
“There was a lively discussion of the need to expand the instructional-support role of undergraduates but no real opposition,” Feigenbaum wrote in an email, explaining that the course would need to develop its own on-the ground instructional staff, who would hold office hours and sections.
Now, according to  Feigenbaum, Harvard faculty must approve of the “joint Harvard-Yale CS50” in order to move forward with its implementation.
“I'm very optimistic that Harvard will approve the joint course as well,” Feigenbaum wrote in an email Thursday.
Harvard CS50 Professor David J. Malan ’99 did not respond to request for comment on the development, but said through a spokesperson earlier this week that he has considered offering  CS50 jointly at both Harvard and Yale and "expect[s] [to] know more by December."
Malan emailed Feigenbaum over the summer proposing an idea for a “joint Harvard-Yale CS50,” course, which Feigenbaum said would consist of Malan’s lectures streamed to Yale and would be led by an on-the-ground instructor and Yale support staff.
Prior to the faculty’s vote, Yale had already tapped a professor, Brian Scassellati, to teach the course in New Haven, according to Feigenbaum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Midway through the second half, the Harvard women’s soccer team took a series of corner kicks. The Crimson failed to convert its first two crosses into the box and the score remained locked, 1-1. On the third corner, Harvard decided to switch its strategy.
Co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby sent a soft pass to sophomore forward Midge Purce, who dribbled towards Columbia’s goal. Purce was taken down just outside the box, setting up a free kick for senior Bethany Kanten. Kanten returned to the Crimson’s original strategy by sending a high cross into the box.
But this time, Purce connected. Her header sailed into the back of the net, giving Harvard its second goal of the game and its second consecutive Ivy title.
Just like this goal, nothing came easy for the Crimson (10-4-2, 5-1-1 Ivy) in its must-win contest against the Lions (7-4-6, 2-3-2).
“It was a battle,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “It was not pretty. It was exactly what you would expect a championship game to be like. Columbia’s a really good team and we had to give everything we had. But we pulled it off, and I think it’s a testament to our mentality and our grit.”
Although Harvard dominated possession in the first half, the team could not find its rhythm. The Crimson struggled to connect passes or generate any serious threats to the Lions’ defense. Columbia’s goalkeeper easily handled Harvard’s first three shots on goal. This was familiar territory for the Crimson offense, which had a .124 shot percentage this season.
“We practiced finishing all week,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “But it still didn’t exactly show up in the game. And yet they fought through a day that wasn’t their A-plus.”
Nearing the 30-minute mark of the first half, the Crimson broke through. Junior forward Emily Mosbacher sent a cross to Purce who one-touched it into far right pocket of the net to give Harvard a 1-0 advantage.
This goal seemed decisive, since the Crimson had only dropped one nonconference contest and no league games when it scored at least one goal.
But Harvard surrendered its lead with two-and-a-half minutes left in the first half. Lions’ senior forward Colleen Rizzo headed the ball to teammate Erin Falk off a Columbia free kick from 40 yards out. Despite a handful of Crimson defenders, the Lions’ senior midfielder managed to tip the ball into the back of the net to even the score.
“We were fortunate to be 1-1 at half,” Leone said. “We were playing okay, but not at the pace we needed to play at. So we wanted to just come out with a better attitude and a better focus in the second half, and that’s what we did.”
Columbia carried the momentum from its late equalizer into the second half. The Lions took three corners in the first five minutes of the period. But Columbia could not manage a shot on goal in these opening moments—or in the rest of the half.
The Lions’ defense entered the game as the 11th best in the nation for goals against. Columbia allowed just nine goals in its first 16 games and held all but two of its previous opponents to a goal or fewer. But in this battle, Harvard’s defense came out on top. The Crimson allowed the Lions just two shots in the contest.
After Columbia failed to capitalize on its three corners, it appeared that Harvard would do the same. But the third corner came together for the Crimson. The Lions’ foul on Purce, one of Columbia’s nine in the second half, set up Purce’s second goal of the afternoon and eighth of the season.
And in this half, Harvard refused to squander its advantage. Although Columbia threatened again with just over two minutes left in the period, sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack came out of net to intercept the Lions’ late drive and preserve the Crimson lead.
For the Harvard seniors, this Ivy title was their third in four years.
“It really stacks them up against the best that Harvard’s ever had,” Leone said. “To win three Ivy Championships is quite an accomplishment. I couldn’t be prouder of that class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the Ivy League-best Harvard defense has enjoyed considerable success keeping its opponents off the scoreboard, the unit had yet to record any points itself entering Saturday’s game against Columbia.
That no longer remained the case by the conclusion of the contest at Harvard Stadium. The Crimson’s 45-0 rout of the Lions was fueled by three interceptions returned for touchdowns and a total of six forced turnovers.
Two of those pick-sixes were converted by senior linebacker Connor Sheehan. The first came early in the game, when a pass from Columbia quarterback Trevor McDonagh caromed directly into Sheehan’s hands. The result was a 48-yard interception return and the linebacker’s first collegiate touchdown.
“The first one, [junior linebacker] Eric Medes had a great hit on the receiver, [and] the ball popped up,” Sheehan said. “If I didn’t make the play, that’s just bad on me.”
While Medes received an assist on the first pick-six, Sheehan deserved all the credit for his second. Jumping a short route in the third quarter, Sheehan snatched McDonagh’s pass out of the air and proceeded to weave his way through a horde of Lions nearly 60 yards for the score.
Sheehan was not the only Harvard (8-0, 5-0 Ivy) linebacker to find the end zone against Columbia (0-8, 0-5). An errant first quarter McDonagh pass fell into the arms of the crashing junior linebacker Matt Koran, who dashed 34 yards untouched to give Harvard a 14-0 lead.
But defensive contributions were not limited to the three interception returns, which marked a single-game school record. The Harvard defense recovered a fumble that set up a short touchdown, forced another fourth-quarter fumble, and notched one more interception. At the end of the game, the turnover margin was six—not including a blocked punt midway through the second quarter.
“We come out with intensity, the speed we have, and we just let it show on the field,” junior defensive back Asante Gibson said. “We just come out and do what we’re coached to do.”
SECOND-STRING STARTERS
With Harvard in firm control of the game by the third quarter, a number of starters took seats on the bench to give other players opportunities to make contributions.
No one shined in the second half as much as freshman running back Semar Smith. Despite receiving carries in four games this season, Smith had not yet found the end zone. That changed early in the second half, when the freshman took a handoff and forced his way through the line for a three-yard score.
With the assistance of clearout blocking from the offensive line, Smith dominated the next offensive series, gaining a total of 73 yards on three consecutive carries. The freshman finished with 114 rushing yards on just 11 touches.
Sophomore quarterback Joseph Viviano III also demonstrated his playmaking abilities in his first action all year as he stepped in for junior Scott Hosch. On a third-down keeper, Viviano made his way to the sideline and scampered for a gain of 53 yards. The sophomore lost a fumble, however, later in the drive.
IN COMMAND OF COLUMBIA
Saturday’s home victory marked the third consecutive game in which the Crimson recorded a shutout against Columbia. The scores from 2012 to 2014 all denote the blowouts that the games were: 69-0, 34-0, and 45-0.
“It just shows a lot about the maturation of our defense,” said senior defensive tackle Obum Obukwelu. “It means a lot to make sure they haven’t scored a point on us in three years.”
While Harvard has had no trouble lighting up the scoreboard against the Lions—the Crimson has averaged nearly 490 yards per game in the last three meetings—the high offensive output has been rendered unnecessary due to staunch defensive performances.
The Harvard defense has shown up to play all year long, allowing just a conference-best 9.4 points per game. But it has shined particularly well against Columbia.
“The effort, the chemistry, and obviously the execution and production has been just tremendous,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I mean, statistically remarkable…. But when you play great defense, as I always say to our guys, you’re in every game.”
