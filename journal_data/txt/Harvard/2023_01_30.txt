After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On January 19, after around a week of student and alumni advocacy and widespread media attention, Harvard Kennedy School’s Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf acknowledged that he had “made an error in [his] decision not to appoint [Kenneth Roth] as a Fellow at [the] Carr Center for Human Rights.” Again and again, I heard sighs of relief at how academic freedom had been saved at Harvard.
Rosy as the reversal sounded, the accompanying sighs highlighted an expected but disappointing reality: Harvard students are often content to advocate for politically neutral academic freedom, but many stay silent when it comes to confronting the brutal oppression of Palestinians.
It seems a couple points were absent from Dean Elmendorf’s announcement. At no point did he address the elephant in the room: what scholars like Cornel R. West ’74 have alleged as Harvard’s complicity in silencing voices that call for Palestinian freedom.
While I welcome the reversal, let’s be clear: What is essentially a tactical decision deserves little praise. I’m sure Dean Elmendorf wouldn’t have wanted some reaction like a fired-up student body holding placards in the Kennedy School lobby; God forbid a public scandal besmirch Harvard’s gleaming reputation. Instead, it would be much easier to give Roth a fellowship, apologize for the temporary doubt cast upon HKS’s sacred mission, and hope that everything would be swept under the rug by the time we arrived back for our first week of classes.
But Roth’s allegation that Elmendorf denied his fellowship on the basis of Human Rights Watch’s “anti-Israel bias” under his leadership cannot be swept under the rug. What “bias” really appears to mean is that Roth doesn’t cower down to the deeply-rooted racism against Palestinians I believe is present throughout United States foreign policy and the Kennedy School itself.
To be precise, Roth isn’t afraid to call Israel what Amnesty International agrees it is: an apartheid regime.
I’d wager that Roth’s courage in calling out Israel’s apartheid regime is despised by some at the Kennedy School. It’s much easier to keep discussing stability in the world in conversations I believe functionally mislead and dehumanize people, treating Palestinians like chess-pieces to be disposed of where America’s interests deem fit. At the end of the day, what’s a little collateral damage to keep Uncle Sam on top?
In his announcement of the reversal, Dean Elmendorf said his initial decision “inadvertently cast doubt on the mission of the School.” So it’s worth reexamining what, exactly, this mission represents. The Kennedy School claims to “improve public policy and leadership so people can live in societies that are more safe, free, just, and sustainably prosperous.” What definition of safe, free, and just makes it permissible to turn a blind eye to what even Israeli historians and journalists have labeled ethnic cleansing?
Perhaps they mean free from accountability. Or free to unleash relentless violence against Palestinians under the guise of stability. Perhaps it is the same brand of freedom that justifies U.S.-backed interventions, regime changes, and crimes against humanity across the Global South. Get the beers and hotdogs out — Henry Kissinger is bringing you freedom!
Similarly, HKS’s track record of offering positions should make us skeptical of the sincerity of its mission statement.
HKS has proudly lended its name to Amos Yadlin, a former general in the Israeli Air Force who participated in the brutal war on Lebanon in 1982. Yadlin is known to be an architect of the Israeli military's policy on “targeted killings” — killings of Israeli government-designated terrorists without trial that have resulted in scores of civilian deaths. The U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has declared these civilian killings unlawful and suggested they may violate the Geneva Convention, but HKS is happy to provide Yadlin with a platform to teach about national security.
Yadlin is only one of several questionable characters. As Harvard students, we cannot continue to let our University welcome agents of colonial violence while denying those who reject U.S.-backed Israeli apartheid.
HKS reversed the initial decision in Roth’s case, but it happened only after wide public criticism due to Roth’s global platform and stature. If this was how Harvard treated a renowned figure, what is happening to the voices of Palestinian supporters with less extensive platforms?
What Roth’s situation made blatantly clear is this: Pressure works. I find it unlikely, to say the least, that Dean Elmendorf woke up one day, in the midst of a public relations storm targeted at him, and discovered his moral conscience. It is far more plausible that he reversed the decision because of the immense backlash from student organizing groups, faculty members, and news outlets.
But if we really care about freedom for Palestinians, appointing Kenneth Roth is the bare minimum. We must start to apply pressure and amplify Palestianians’ demands for justice.
We cannot be satisfied with hollow apology emails. We cannot be satisfied with mere verbal commitments to anti-racism; we must demand divestment from companies complicit in Israel’s human rights violations against Palestinians, and a University environment that treats Palestinian freedom as central to human rights. To call for accountability means to go beyond echoing the politically neutral call for free speech and ask ourselves difficult questions: In silencing Kenneth Roth, what was Harvard trying to shield its students from? And in reinstating his fellowship without addressing its own considerable bias, who does Harvard continue to silence?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meet our fictional protagonist, Kelly. She helps start a magazine, an Asian one. (She’s Chinese-American).
She plans its launch party, catering Korean fried chicken and Kung Fu Tea, the twin monopolies on Asian™ culture. Disclaimer: She had a paper to write — otherwise, she would’ve hand-folded dumplings as taught by her ancestors.
***
My stomach turned when I read yet another novel with the Chinese Cultural Revolution as its backdrop. When I watched Turning Red, the Disney movie with the strict-Chinese-mother versus rebellious-daughter trope. And when I wrote a story about intergenerational trauma based on my (Chinese-American) family.
Because I thought, “Uh-oh, another one.”
Hear me out. If we only tell certain narratives, those may be the only things people think define the Asian diaspora — for example, in the case of the Chinese-American community, parental expectations and hauntings of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, perhaps we should strive to tell stories like the film “Everything, Everywhere All at Once” which “takes apart” and “wackily reassembles” Asian stereotypes (and just earned 11 Oscar nominations).
After stewing over whether this revelation was self-loathing of my identity or next-level-woke, I decided it was both.
We make room for countless romances in Paris, so why can’t there be multiple stories about Chinese-parent trauma? Why can’t Michelle Yeoh – who just took home a Golden Globe for her performance in “Everything, Everywhere All at Once” — keep playing strong-wise women in her films, like Owen Wilson playing awkward-endearing men in his gazillion rom-coms? Telling a story that overlaps with another, shouldn’t make it any less valuable. It says, I am here, and this is my story: as one of this eclectic yet shared we.
Moreover, expecting marginalized storytellers to chart new frontiers may unjustly burden them – echoing how minorities in the public eye are often asked to speak for their “people.” For instance, Indian-American actress-producer-writer Mindy Kaling, across her works, has received criticism for leaning into South Asian stereotypes – from rom-com “Never Have I Ever” to Scooby-Doo prequel “Velma.” But as one of the few high-visibility South Asian women in Hollywood, Kaling has been, perhaps unfairly, a “lightning rod” for such criticism.
Ideally, we all can have our stories heard, simply because we want to tell them: without the duty to forge equity under our fingertips.
***
Kelly runs into her roommates on her way to the party. She mentions the magazine and the importance of diverse stories. One roommate says iLoveCrazyRichAsians. They nervous-giggle, and congratulate her on her Asian Achievement.
***
So, diverse stories can’t all be perfect. But it’s still a first step that “Crazy Rich Asians” was the first major film with an all-Asian cast in 25 years, and that Asian-diasporic writers are getting book deals. Right?
Sure. But (surprise-surprise) that isn’t enough. As a kid, I was happy to encounter any characters who looked like me, from ditzy London Tipton on Disney’s “The Suite Life” to (the maybe-racistly named) Cho Chang in the “Harry Potter” series. But, I first realized I could truly be in a story when I met Frank Zhang of the “Heroes of Olympus” series: a relatably awkward kid whose Chinese lineage granted him extraordinary powers. And indeed, research indicates the need for authentic storytelling, since positive portrayals of characters with our identity correlate with increased feelings of belonging and self-esteem.
In addition to the lack of such storytelling, our current “diverse” narratives still aren’t diverse enough. For instance, Disney’s “Raya and the Last Dragon” had a mostly east-Asian cast while muddling the individuality of Southeast-Asian countries into the fictional land of Kumandra. Popular series (‘To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before”, “Never Have I Ever”) feature Asian-American gals with white guy love interests – implicitly limiting the potential range of Asian love stories, and alluding to the historical fetishization of Asian women by white men. And there’s heavy upper-caste presence within Indian representation on screen — not to mention how many articles discuss Asian achievements, referring to only those of east-Asian descent.
In short, we need visibility of Asian stories that encompass: in theme, genre, and the term Asian itself. But I don’t want to overlook current efforts to do so: from Kaya Press, an imprint unconstrained by stereotypically Asian topics, to Randall Park’s film “Shortcomings,” with Asian characters simply “going through life stuff.”
Still, the keyword is visibility (as exemplified by how I had to do some digging to find those examples). True progress requires traditional decision makers to prioritize the reach of diverse creators to wider audiences. A lofty prospect for media institutions, considering how all minority groups are underrepresented in screenwriting and directing in Hollywood, and how 85% of those at the Big Five publishing houses are white.
No matter how many nuanced narratives we create or seek, we only truly move the needle if the Gatekeepers do it with us. (Or better yet, if we become the Gatekeepers and rip the gate off its hinges.)
***
After the party, Kelly is tired. She wants to have a laugh watching “Never Have I Ever,” acknowledge its glorification of Indian cliches, and discover vastly more stories.
But, she doesn’t want everyone to think that all Chinese kids have a family temple, love bubble tea and boybands, and morph into animals like the Turning Red protagonist. Her, and Frank Zhang’s stomachs, might turn at that.
(Well, she does love taro milk-tea and had a K-pop phase, and Frank’s superpower is animal shape-shifting. But that’s besides the point. Since they can overlap and tell their unique stories with pride.)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Undergraduate Association officers said at their weekly meeting Saturday that the body does not review most receipts for spending from grants and stipends — instead, officers “selectively audit” purchase records.
HUA officers clashed over the way the body monitors how funding is spent by clubs and students during a vote for a proposal to provide academic stipends for textbook purchases. The proposed stipend — which aims to provide 180 students with $50 each toward textbooks — would rely on an honor system to ensure funds are used exclusively for textbooks and other academic purchases.
Though the initiative passed 8-2, some officers raised concerns over the stipend’s structure.
“If I participate in this program and I win the lottery, and I get my $50 and then I buy a book for $10 and I submit my receipt, what happens to the other $40?” asked HUA Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24, who voted against the proposal.
HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 said it would be up to recipients to “use their morals and discretion” to spend the stipend on “academic-related purposes.”
He added that students unable to provide proof of purchase would not be barred from participating in the program, as the HUA is “not here as a receipt police.”
“The truth is, the receipt collection process isn’t to be punitive,” Johnson said. “It’s just as we do with club funding to say, selectively audit and make sure people are doing it. And so I could foresee a situation where someone said, like, ‘Hey, I bought these with cash. I don’t have a receipt.’ And I think that’s fine.”
The HUA received $450,000 to allocate to clubs during the 2022-2023 academic year, but officers do not typically monitor the spending of clubs that are approved for funding, according to Johnson.
“With club funding, we don’t review every receipt. We can’t,” Johnson said.
Under the textbook stipend program, HUA officers would allocate the money based on applicants’ self-indicated financial aid status without considering the amount each particular student needs for textbooks.
When Estabine suggested reimbursing students up to $50 after they provide documentation of spending on textbooks, Johnson shared concerns over potential delays to the program due to the manual review process.
Johnson justified the plan’s urgency, claiming the HUA needs to spend its remaining budget before the end of the term to avoid a surplus.
Unlike the now-dissolved Undergraduate Council, budget surpluses are not carried over into the next term, but instead returned to the Dean of Students Office. A failure to spend the entire allotted budget will result in budget cuts to the HUA in future years, officers said during the meeting.
“We’re running out of time,” Johnson said. “[The Academic] Team has over $11,000 left, and that money has to be spent by the end of the academic year.”
The UC faced accusations around verifying proper grant spending by student organizations, with a 2019 Harvard Open Data Project article alleging that more than $100,000 of grant money was spent improperly or undocumented.
Still, a 2022 financial audit by Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services was unable to find “evidence of any financial irregularities,” citing unavailable or inconclusive financial records.

Dozens of Harvard students mourned the death of Tyre D. Nichols — the 29-year-old Black skateboarder and photographer who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers following a traffic stop — in a vigil in front of Memorial Church on a drizzly Sunday evening.
The vigil came days after the Memphis Police Department released graphic body camera and surveillance footage of officers beating Nichols, which sparked nationwide fury over police brutality. In the video clips, officers beat Nichols and threaten violence, while he appears to lie on the ground.
Around two weeks after Nichols’ death, the five officers involved in his arrest were fired. Last Thursday, all five were indicted on charges of second-degree murder. The Memphis Police Department also disbanded the controversial SCORPION Unit to which the former officers belonged.
During Sunday’s vigil, organized by members of Harvard’s Black Student Association, several speakers expressed intense grief over Nichols’ death and fiercely critiqued the American policing system.
Rothsaida Sylvaince ’24, the president of the Black Students Association, told the somber crowd she was “disappointed, tired, angry, and upset.”
“Every time I sit here, and I think about what this unjust police system does to us, does to Black people, the way that it sheds our blood without a care or thought, the way that the police system exercises and abuses its power to subjugate Black people in this country, in a way that’s been done for hundreds of years, I’m angry,” Sylvaince said.
“And I don’t want to keep coming here, having to mourn the light and love of our people,” she added.
Ricardo R. “Ricky” Razon ’25, the vice president of the Generational African American Students Association, spoke in remembrance of Nichols, whose “life was taken from him far too soon at the hands of the shameful and cowardly Memphis Police Department.”
“Tyre Nichols was the father to a young Black boy who was four years old,” he said. “His family shares that he loved to skateboard in his free time and was an avid photographer who enjoyed watching the sunset every night.”
“All of which are things he can no longer do, because he has been taken from us,” Razon added.
In a speech, GAASA Treasurer Michaela K. Glavin ’25 called on the audience to “pause to mourn.”
“We need to feel the sadness, feel the pain, feel the anger that comes with losing a life. We know that the police do not care about our lives,” Glavin said. “If we get so desensitized to the point that we stop feeling loss, we are stripped of the love that makes up the very fabric of what it means to be Black in America.”
In an interview after the vigil, Allison M. Hunter ’26 called on Harvard to publicly acknowledge Nichols’ death, saying the situation could not be treated as “business as usual.”
“The sky is crying, like today,” Hunter said, referencing the sparse raindrops falling over Harvard Yard, “because of how much we’re going through and the injustices that are possible.”
“We need a break,” she added. “We need a place to cry and a place to be Black unapologetically.”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment. The Memphis Police Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The videos’ release — and the fatal police shooting of University of Massachusetts Boston student Sayed Faisal in Cambridge earlier this month — spurred a protest and march in the Boston Common on Saturday. Saturday’s protest was organized by the Boston chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation.
More than 150 protesters — including a handful of Harvard undergraduates — rallied across the street from the Massachusetts State House before marching through downtown Boston, singing “Which Side Are You On?” and chanting “Justice for Tyre” and “No good cops in a racist system.”
Speakers and protesters reiterated demands that the Cambridge Police Department release the names of the officers involved in Faisal’s death, as well as the unredacted police report.
In a statement, CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick said all relevant police reports and the names of responding officers, including the one who shot Faisal, would be released following an inquest led by Middlesex County District Attorney Marian T. Ryan.
Ben B. Roberts ’23, who attended the protest, said he found Nichols’ and Faisal’s deaths “horrifying,” but that he was inspired by the protest’s turnout.
“It’s pretty inspiring to be in crowds like that and to know there’s lots of other people out there who don’t think this is acceptable, who want to do something, who want to change something,” Roberts said. “It makes you feel like you’re part of something, not just angry on your own.”
Jason “Kojo” Acheampong ’26, another attendee of Saturday’s protest, said students “live in a bubble” on campus and urged other students to not become “desensitized” to people being killed by police.
“This is what happened in America today,” he added. “This is the function of police.”

A team of Harvard researchers received a grant from the Vranos Family Foundation for a five-year project seeking to find new methods to treat neurodegenerative diseases, according to a December press release.
The researchers on the project include Harvard Medical School professors Zak Kohane and Chirag Patel, Psychology and Neuroscience professor Randy L. Buckner, and Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professors Paola Arlotta and Lee Rubin. The team will conduct both laboratory experiments and computational analyses to determine how the effects of brain aging can be halted or reversed.
The project grew out of earlier experiments by Rubin and other scientists that surgically joined younger and older mice. The experiments suggested that certain blood factors from younger mice, when infused into old mice, had rejuvenating effects on many tissues in old mice, including the brain.
“Most people, when they want to treat a disease, like Alzheimer's disease, are hoping to slow the rate of deterioration — that would be what you would really dream of doing,” Rubin said. “But these experiments in mice suggest that you can do more than slow the deterioration, you can actually reverse the directionality of the changes, so that you can regrow some of the things that you lost as a consequence of aging.”
The team plans to compare key blood factors related to youth to develop treatments for complications associated with the aging brain, such as Alzheimer’s and loss of cognitive ability.
“One of the big goals in the program is to try to do a sufficient number of experiments and bring in a sufficient number of computational people to try to compare all of the factors that have an effect on the brain — to see whether we can identify key processes they all affect,” Rubin said. “Then we try to develop a therapeutic that just goes directly after that process.”
Though the team’s research focuses on the science of aging, Rubin also emphasized the importance of taking into account the existing inequities in healthcare and the accessibility of potential aging treatments.
“Aging isn’t just a science problem — it’s a societal problem,” he said. “We’re the scientists in this, but I think we also have to be very mindful that we won’t be really successful unless we can think of a way of coming up with a treatment that works and hopefully is affordable.”
“We're really kind of banding together to see if we could discover an effective therapy and actually bring it to the clinic,” Rubin added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beloved Cambridge nightclub ManRay reopened to partygoers last Wednesday, almost 20 years after it shut down.
Located on 40 Prospect St. in Central Square, the alternative nightclub serves as a self-avowed sanctuary for counterculture groups, goths, LGBTQ+ people, and more. Its new space boasts a brand new dance floor, as well as lighting and sound systems.
In its early days, ManRay functioned as an underground club with “artsy intentions,” according to Chris Ewen, former resident DJ.
“We catered to different crowds of people on different nights, and it evolved through time and it became a home for LGBTQ+ people and fetish underground,” Ewen said.
“We became a home for lots of really cool subcultures,” he added.
Inclusivity formed a central component of ManRay’s original purpose, according to Ewen.
“It was understood that you would find like-minded people and you wouldn’t be harassed while you were there,” he added.
Despite closing its doors in 2005, ManRay’s loyal patrons didn’t disappear. According to hostess and promoter Xtine Santackas, ManRay would host Twitch and Zoom parties throughout the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns.
“It was part of the feeling of memory that we certainly weren’t going to let go of,” Santackas said. “We did our best to nurture that even though the doors were shut.”
In 2021, ManRay took over ImprovBoston’s former space in Central Square. Reopening during a global pandemic, however, was no small feat, Ewen said.
Contractor difficulties and supply chain shortages were just some of the issues the nightclub faced, according to Santackas.
“It was a nightmare,” bartender Terri Niedzwiecki added.
When ManRay reopened its doors earlier this month, however, “the cheer could be heard from Central Square to Porter Square,” Santackas said.
“It’s a really strong community that goes there,” Niedzwiecki said, “And opening night, it was like all everyone kept saying was, ‘I'm home now.’”
In the future, ManRay plans on working with a rotation of artists, go-go dancers, and new DJ’s, hoping to make their mark on the alternative scene, according to Santackas.
ManRay intends to keep its original vibe, but bring in “different perspectives on what nightlife is today and try to keep it fresh and exciting,” Ewen said.
Ewen added he believes spaces dedicated to subculture groups and marginalized identities are still as vital as they were in 2005.
“It would be nice to think that you can be a trans person or a drag queen, or just wear all black, and go into a space and not be looked at funny,” Ewen said.
“There still needs to be viable and safe spaces,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of activists and Cambridge residents gathered Sunday for a rally at Somerville High School and a march to the Cambridge Police Department headquarters to protest the police killing of Sayed Faisal earlier this month.
The fatal shooting of Faisal — who was a 20-year student at the University of Massachusetts Boston — by Cambridge Police on Jan. 4 has sparked outrage, including several rallies, a tense community meeting, and the storming of a recent City Council meeting by protesters. The killing is currently under investigation by the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office.
The demonstration began at Somerville High School, where Faisal graduated in 2020, with protesters chanting “Justice for Faisal,” listening to speeches from organizers, and singing “We Shall Not Be Moved.” Protesters then participated in a nearly two-mile march to the CPD police station, where organizers delivered a set of demands to city officials.
The demands — addressed to Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, and Police Commissioner Christine A. Elow — included calls to release the names of the officers involved in Faisal’s death, and terminate and prosecute them. Protesters also demanded police demilitarization, funding for an alternative emergency response team, and reallocation of police funding towards community safety initiatives.
The names of the officers involved as well as the unredacted police report will be released following the completion of the district attorney’s investigation.
Matthew Kennedy, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation, said that he was “heartbroken” and “angry” after the killing of Faisal.
“A murder like this can’t happen again,” he said. “Cambridge needs to fully fund an alternative emergency response program separate from the police department.”
After delivering demands to the police department, organizers entered the station and asked to speak to Elow.
“They’re calling to see if Police Commissioner Christine Elow is here and if she’s brave enough to actually face her own community,” said Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Suhail P. Purkar.
While Elow did not address protesters, the organizers left written demands at the station with the hope that they are delivered to Elow.
CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote in an emailed statement that the department “will always support residents exercising their 1st amendment right to peacefully protest, demand action, and results.” Warnick added that CPD filed a report after the protest alleging that demonstrators “tagged” a memorial honoring fallen officers.
Several of Faisal’s teachers from his time at Somerville High School were present at the rally. Maria Khwaja, who taught Faisal his senior year, said that he was “so full of this beautiful, gentle light.”
“It’s my job to save these lives. That’s my job. Not kill them,” she added. “They’re not threatening. Even if they were threatening — I’ve never found a child threatening — but even if they were, it’s still my job to save them.”
Sara Halawa, an organizer with Safe Schools Somerville, also talked about Faisal’s involvement as a student at Somerville High School.
“He immediately got involved in every community organization that we have set up for immigrant youth,” Halawa said.
“This was someone who worked hard, who participated in the community,” she added. “This should not have happened.”
Some protesters also referred to the recent killing of Tyre Nichols by Memphis Police earlier this month, noting that the investigation moved faster than in Faisal’s case. The five officers involved in Nichols’ killing have been terminated by the department and charged with second-degree murder.
“That’s exactly what we need,” Purkar said. “We need for them to be fired immediately. We need for them to be in jail — not tomorrow, not next week, not in February 2024. Right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Institute of Politics announced Kenneth Roth will speak at a Feb. 8 JFK Jr. Forum, roughly a month after reports emerged alleging Roth was blocked from a fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr Center for Human Rights over his criticism of Israel.
At next Wednesday’s forum, Roth will discuss major changes to the landscape of human rights work, his experience leading Human Rights Watch, and “the future of human rights,” the IOP announced Sunday.
This announcement comes 10 days after Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf — who often sits in the front row at the IOP’s JFK Jr. Forums — reversed his veto on Roth’s fellowship appointment. Elmendorf’s decision to block Roth’s fellowship drew widespread backlash from student groups and faculty members, with more than 1,000 students signing an open letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling for Elmendorf’s resignation.
Roth wrote in a statement to The Crimson that he plans to address the controversy surrounding Elmendorf’s initial decision to block his appointment.
“I’m glad finally to have the opportunity belatedly to start my fellowship at the Kennedy School,” he wrote. “My focus isn’t the Dean’s initial veto of my fellowship because of my criticism of Israel, but that is the gorilla in the room that I undoubtedly will have to address as well.”
During the forum, Mathias Risse, the director of the Carr Center, will deliver remarks and introduce Roth. Risse, who informed Roth his fellowship had been vetoed, previously wrote that explaining the decision “was one of the lowest moments in my professional life,” according to an email Risse sent to Carr Center affiliates.
The event will be moderated by outgoing Carr Center Executive Director Sushma Raman, who currently serves as the president and CEO of the Heising-Simons Foundation. Raman is set to step down as executive director on Feb. 10, with her decision to leave announced soon after the Kennedy School came under scrutiny for Elmendorf’s veto of Roth’s fellowship. She did not say whether her resignation was related to the fellowship decision.
Only Harvard ID holders can register to attend the forum in person, according to the IOP’s website. Registration for virtual attendance is not required, and the event will be streamed live via IOP social media pages.
Correction: January 31, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Sushma Raman had departed her role as executive director of the Carr Center. In fact, though Raman’s departure was announced on Jan. 11, she will continue as executive director until Feb. 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds gathered at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute for a two-day conference about abortion rights and legislation in the United States on Thursday evening and Friday.
The conference, hosted just days after the 50th anniversary of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade, discussed how the issue of abortion has been impacted by the initial ruling and its reversal last summer in the Court’s ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. The ruling in Dobbs, which overturned the Roe decision in a 6-3 vote, eliminated constitutional protections for abortion.
The conference launched Thursday evening with a conversation featuring pro-abortion and anti-abortion activists. Programming on Friday heavily featured academic speakers and focused on four topics related to abortion: international contexts, the impacts of race and class, abortion’s role in American public life, and the future of abortion.
Harvard Radcliffe Institute Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin opened the conference on Friday with a speech explaining the historical background of the abortion debate and the theme of the conference.
“As I have written in my own work about law and social change, Supreme Court opinions are never divorced from the broader cultural and social context,” Brown-Nagin said. “Rather, these decisions will shape and reflect national debates about controversial issues.”
Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a professor of history at Calvin University, spoke about the historical context behind abortion in the U.S. during a Friday panel.
“Initially in this country, most abortions were procured by young, poor, and unmarried women. After 1840, we see a rise of medical abortions among middle and upper classes,” Du Mez said. “Male doctors led efforts to criminalize abortion. They argued that life began at conception.”
Daniel K. Williams, a history professor at the University of West Georgia, highlighted the significance of evangelical Christians on the historical development of the abortion debate and their views on Roe v. Wade.
“By the end of the 1970s, a growing number of evangelicals began to view Roe as the symbol of both secularization and the sexual revolution, and therefore the symbol of all the moral evils they opposed,” Williams said.
Josie Pinto, co-founder of the Reproductive Freedom Fund of New Hampshire, said they attended the event to expand their knowledge of the academic conversations surrounding abortion.
“I’m thinking a lot about how we can bridge people that work with patients accessing abortion every day and then people who are more studying it in a very theoretical, legal-type space,” Pinto said.
“I was really just excited to hear what people in a more academic space had to say because I work on the frontlines of this work,” they added.
Columbia professor Beverly Winikoff ’66 — who helped develop the abortion pill — said the speakers could have further discussed how changes in abortion law influenced the development of medical technology, noting that Roe ushered in a new wave of medical innovation.
“Not many people have made reference to the fact that the abortion pill was made during the age of Roe, because of Roe, and because of the acceptance that some people will have abortions and they need to have different technology than they’ve had in the past,” Winikoff said.
Jane Kamensky, a history professor at Harvard and the director of the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, highlighted the importance of having difficult conversations “about what is arguably the most difficult single issue in American life at every level — from the pregnant body, to the household, to the statehouse, and Congress, and the Supreme Court.”
“Talking is harder than trolling,” Kamensky said. “Talking is harder than racking up snaps and props and likes in our echo chambers.”
“But talking across as well as within our hidden tribes is, at its core, the work of democracy and of the civil renewal that we need so badly in the United States,” Kamensky added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Harvard’s Pforzheimer House faculty deans Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant set to step down after 10 years, residents reflected on their tenure and expressed hopes for successors who uphold a supportive house culture.
Harrington and Durant received praise from students for establishing new traditions and welcoming students at house events. As a part of their time as deans, the pair introduced Camp Pfoho, a day-long retreat for the house’s incoming sophomores. Students praised the event, which is unique to Pfoho, for fostering a tight-knit house.
Manas Kulkarni ’25 found Harrington to be a welcoming dean.
“She was a big part of why the new sophomores felt extremely welcome into Pfoho,” he said.
Allison Y. Oh ’25 said the pair was “always involved” and frequently socialized with students in the dining hall.
“I’m really sad to see them go,” Oh said. “They’re always involved. They’re always like in the dhall, talking to us and they always host all these events and do stuff for the house.”
Harrington, ​​a professor and director of undergraduate studies in the History of Science Department, and Durant, the director of the MIT Museum and an MIT adjunct professor, said they discovered a passion for supporting students in the residential setting after teaching and traveling with Harvard Summer School.
“We realized that we enjoy the close-quarters care for students we were teaching,” Harrington said in an interview.
Harrington said living with students is a source of “deep satisfaction” akin to “looking after your kids.”
The search for a new pair of faculty deans can take many months and involves consultation with administrators and residents.
Students, faculty, and staff are first given the opportunity to nominate tenured faculty to the role, though faculty can also self-nominate. From there, a search committee makes a list of priorities, and the Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana selects a few pairs of candidates, who interview with current students, house staff, and College officials. Khurana then consults with the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the University president before offering the position to a pair.
“Our toughest interview was with Pfoho students,” Harrington said. “Much tougher than the faculty deans, even much tougher than with the dean of the College who eventually appointed us.”
Jane J. Oh ’24 said she hopes for faculty deans that prioritize collaboration with students and across other houses, especially those in the Quad.
“From what I hear, pre-Covid times, the Quad community was very tight-knit, and I would love to see it get back to where it was before Covid,” she said.
Some said they are looking for faculty deans who will boost house spirit.
“I’m just looking for someone who’s really passionate about house spirit and getting to know the people here,” Allison Oh said.
John Stratton “Strat” Tolmie IV ’25 said Pfoho’s small population and location in the Quad mean strong faculty deans are “especially important” for the house.
“Pfoho being in the Quad, we also lose a lot of people to the river, to transfers,” Tolmie said. “We have a really nice community here, and I hope it stays that way.”
Others were more ambivalent about their house’s next leaders.
“For a large part of the student population, it really doesn’t matter who they are as long as they let us do our own thing,” Kulkarni said.
“As long as they don’t make any drastic changes, that’s fine,” Miguel Fernandez ’25 said.
The deans said those who can integrate themselves into the preexisting house environment while bringing their own unique personality and traditions are best fit for the role.
“It does take particular kinds of people — I think it’s very clear — to come in, so I would like and I hope that they really care about the place and that they really enjoy it,” Durant said. “In a way, it isn’t just a job, so you can’t really look at it quite like that.”
Still, Harrington said there is “no single way” to be a faculty dean.
“Everyone brings their own personality and style,” Harrington said. “What I hope is that the new faculty deans embrace this community that’s here and bring their own personality and passions into that community.”
While Harrington and Durant may be preparing to leave their formal roles at Pfoho, they said they will take with them the memories of their time at the house.
“They talk about the house system being transformative for students,” Harrington said. “I think it’s transformative for faculty deans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 10 Harvard men’s ice hockey team has battled inconsistency throughout its 2022-2023 campaign, with periods of brilliance and resilience late in games occasionally overshadowed by sloppy play and penalties that force the team to chase the game. However, after an up-and-down Friday night overtime victory over the Colgate Raiders, the Crimson responded with their most complete victory of the season on Saturday in a 6-2 domination of the archrival Cornell Big Red, a critical stepping stone as Harvard enters the most challenging stretch of its campaign.
“I think we've played well in spurts. Unfortunately, for the most part, those spurts have been at the end of the game as we've been chasing it,” head coach Ted Donato said on Saturday night. “I thought we started the game on time, and they had their moments where they pinned us in our zone…but I thought it was a really good effort all the way across the board.”
For the team’s senior leadership, the achievement of a season sweep and a 4-1-1 career record over a bitter rival was especially meaningful.
“They're obviously a huge rival of ours and someone that whenever they're on our calendar, it's kind of a marquee matchup,” senior defenseman and captain Henry Thrun said. “We go 2-0 against them this year, 2-0 last year, and then freshman year we had a loss and a tie, so for us to wrap up the regular season against them 4-1-1, I think that’s pretty solid and something that’s a big momentum swing for our group.”
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 2
Right from the opening puck drop, both teams sought to set the tone defensively, only combining for four shots on goal in the first eight minutes of play. However, after Cornell forward Ben Berard narrowly missed a goal with a rocket off the crossbar, the teams began to generate offense at lightning speed. Just seconds after Berard’s near miss, junior forward Sean Farrell broke out of the defensive zone on a breakaway, but Cornell goaltender Ian Shane stuck with him and shut the play down. The Big Red pushed back immediately, however, with several strong shifts in the offensive zone, and with seven minutes remaining in the first period, Cornell forward Ondrej Psenicka deflected a shot from the point past senior goaltender Mitchell Gibson, giving the visitors a 1-0 lead.
However, the Crimson answered Cornell’s opening tally just over two minutes later, as Farrell’s shot from the point pinballed around the front of the net until it found sophomore forward Matthew Coronato, who deflected the puck past Shane to tie the game at 1-1. Berard’s line continued to drive play late in the period, but Gibson made a series of saves under duress to keep the game tied entering the first intermission.
“I think it was probably our resilience tonight,” said senior forward and captain John Farinacci when asked about a key to the victory. “I think they had a lot of moments in the game where they were pushing…I think just pushing through those tough moments when they have the puck for a while and they're keeping possession and getting the pucks out when we needed to and flipping the ends of the ice was a key part.”
The game’s offensive fervor continued early in the second period, as Thrun put the Crimson in front 2-1 only 36 seconds into the period, shifting to his left along the blue line to shake free of his defender before firing a wrist shot through Shane. Harvard kept the pressure on after Thrun’s tally, and less than three minutes later, Coronato lit the lamp for a second time when he finished off a well-executed 2-on-1 with Farrell, giving the Crimson a 3-1 lead. Harvard tacked on its third goal of the period three and a half minutes later on the power play, as Farinacci poked home a loose puck in the crease for his first goal of the campaign, extending the advantage to 4-1.
However, with just under seven minutes remaining in the second frame, the Big Red got back into the contest thanks to a great individual effort from defenseman Sam Malinski. The Cornell captain scored on a wrist shot from the circle while being slashed by Farrell, cutting the Cornell deficit to 4-2 and giving the Big Red a power play immediately afterwards. Despite Cornell capturing some momentum, the Harvard penalty kill was rock solid, shutting down the Big Red power play unit, and the bitter rivals ended the second period with the Crimson in front 4-2.
“​​Once we were able to get the lead, we were able to play the game that we wanted, which was more up and down the ice and use our speed to possess the puck down low,” Donato said.
Facing a two-goal deficit, Cornell attempted to push the pace on offense at the outset of the third period. Berard’s line had a series of good chances on their early shifts of the period, and Berard himself snuck past the Harvard defense at the blue line to create a partial breakaway, but the forward was unable to capitalize. Gibson later denied an excellent netfront deflection by Berard, and sophomore defenseman Jack Bar made an excellent play on the backcheck to break up a developing Cornell odd-man rush. After withstanding the Big Red’s surge, Harvard went on the counter-attack in the middle stages of the third period. After surging through the neutral zone on the rush, first-year forward Joe Miller sent a perfect pass to junior forward Alex Laferriere in the high slot, who fired a rocket over Shane’s shoulder to push the Crimson lead to 5-2. Senior defenseman Ryan Siedem added an empty-net goal in the final minute of action, giving Harvard a 6-2 victory and earning the Crimson a season sweep of Cornell.
HARVARD 5, COLGATE 4 (OT)
Harvard opened the weekend with an overtime thriller against ECAC opponent Colgate. The nationally unranked Raiders came to Bright-Landry following their win last week against No. 3 Quinnipiac, and brought the same aggression to their match up with the Crimson.
“I thought Colgate played a really smart, hard road game and we chased the game most of the night: down two to nothing, come back and then down again for two,” Coach Donato reflected. “I give our guys a lot of credit for staying with it. Ultimately, the win is a real team builder.”
In an action-packed first period, each team generated a plethora of offensive chances. Colgate struck first seven minutes into the period, as Raiders forward Alex Young created space along the right wing off the rush and got the puck past junior goaltender Derek Mullahy Colgate tacked on another goal five minutes later, as they won a defensive zone faceoff and created a rush opportunity, which forward Ross Mitton finished off to give the Raiders a 2-0 lead. However, Harvard responded less than 30 seconds later, as Laferriere fired a hard wrist shot from the right-wing circle off the post and past Colgate goaltender Carter Gylander, cutting the Crimson deficit to 2-1.
The teams continued to raise the intensity level in the remainder of the first period with a number of after-the-whistle battles, and after Mullahy stopped a scoring chance from point blank range with about four minutes left in the first, the teams gathered again in a netfront scrum. Harvard soon responded to the intensity, and with just over a minute remaining in the period, Laferriere tallied his second goal of the night when he cleaned up a rebound from Miller during a chaotic scramble in front of the net.
Despite the Crimson’s strong finish to the first period, the second period belonged to Colgate, as the Raiders outshot Harvard 14-10. After just under five minutes of action, Raiders forward Ryan McGuire put Colgate in front when Mullahy failed to control a rebound, allowing the Raiders to pounce on the loose puck and take a 3-2 lead. Less than a minute later, the Raiders recorded another. Forward Colton Young fought through traffic in the right-wing corner before feeding a wide-open Alex Young, who made no mistake on his rocket from the right faceoff circle, extending the Colgate advantage to 4-2. The Crimson failed to generate much offense for the rest of the period, save for their final two shifts, and Harvard headed to the locker room facing a two goal deficit for the second time in the game.
Despite the poor second period showing, the Crimson came to life quickly to start the third frame. On an early power play, Harvard was unable to find the net despite putting six shots on Gylander, but the Crimson cut the deficit to 4-3 only 14 seconds later. After a pass by the Colgate defense deflected off of Miller’s skate and into the slot, sophomore forward Zakary Karpa fired a perfectly placed wrist shot past Gylander to trim the deficit to one.
After killing off a tripping penalty to senior forward Austin Wong shortly after Karpa’s goal, the Crimson continued to dominate puck possession until an interference penalty to first-year defenseman Mason Langenbrunner halfway through the period. Harvard’s top-10 ranked penalty kill unit was up to the task, keeping Colgate out of the net and maintaining the Crimson’s chance at a comeback win.
With 2:14 remaining in regulation, Donato called a timeout and brought Mullahy to the bench in favor of a sixth attacker. After the Crimson failed to generate any chances for the first minute of 6-on-5 play, Coronato found Thrun stationed at the point, and the captain ripped a one-timer through traffic and into the net, tying the game at 4-4 with 40 seconds to play. Neither side created any chances in the remainder of regulation, sending the game to overtime.
“We know we got a lot of great players in our room and on our team,” commented Coronato on the momentum shift coming into the third. “We always have a lot of confidence that we can come back and make some plays and score some goals. Coach does a great job motivating us and we did a good job sticking with it.”
In the extra session, Thrun and Coronato combined again to produce the game-winning goal. After Thrun broke up a Colgate rush at the defensive blue line, Coronato sprung loose down the right wing and fired a laser off the crossbar and past Gylander, securing a 5-4 victory for Harvard.
“I think it's just a benefit of playing with great players,” said Coronato of the game-winning goal. “You get put in good spots and just try to do what I can when I get my chance to score.”
The Crimson will be at home at Bright-Landry Hockey Center again next weekend, taking on the No. 3 Quinnipiac Bobcats on Friday at 7:00pm, before facing off with the Boston College Eagles in the first round of the Beanpot Tournament at 5:00pm at T.D. Garden on Monday, February 6th.

There are many strange facts that live rent-free in my brain. One of these facts is that mouse droppings very closely resemble black sesame seeds. This information isn’t relevant just yet. Just remember it for later. Onto the story now:
Last Saturday, I climbed mountains, crossed the seven seas, swam across the Charles River, and finally returned to Cambridge. I exaggerate. It was a six-hour plane ride from California. I rewatched “Ratatouille.” I thought about my classes and felt ~stress~. I took a nap. I watched the Buzz Lightyear movie for the first time. It was an intense and poignant space odyssey with themes of friendship and self-discovery.
Anyway, as the last suitemate to return to Harvard from winter break, I knew my arrival on campus was important. Long-awaited, even. The second I exited the elevator and turned my key in the suite door, all the balance in the world would be restored. I’m not self-absorbed. I’m just secure in my friends’ love for me. And for what it’s worth, I love them too. (Rare wholesome moment, I know).
But little did I know there was another guest waiting to greet me when I walked into my room. I missed my room on campus — the obnoxious fairy lights, many CVS wall photos, and wildly impractical but very soft target shag rug in the middle of the floor.
And while I was lying down on said rug and trying to feel the joy of returning to campus, I noticed something peeking out from under my heater.
No, fear not, it wasn’t a rat. It was actually a huge ass rat.
I’m kidding. It was just a mouse trap.
I’m not often at eye level with the floor, so I wondered. How long has this mousetrap been here? It could have been two months, two weeks, or even just two days. Was it precautionary or the aftermath of a visit from an uninvited guest? And if it was the aftermath of a rodent sighting, why does Harvard think a single mousetrap is going to successfully keep a smart mouse away?
And then I began to spiral. What if this mousetrap really did catch a mouse or rat who was venturing into my room for some warmth? And what if the mouse had a family? Having just watched “Ratatouille,” I was particularly sympathetic to the rodent cause. It’s cold out there. Winter in Cambridge is hard for humans. It’s probably even harder for little animals without homes and Canada Goose coats.
Yet as my sympathy for the rodents of Cambridge began to manifest in the form of tears, I received confirmation from my suitemates that there had, in fact, been a mouse-sighting in two of their rooms earlier that week.
The tears were immediately sucked back into my eyes. I realized, in that moment, that mice are much cuter in my imagination than they are in real life. I reminded myself that in their barrage of live-action remakes of animated classics, there is a good reason why Disney skipped right over live-action Ratatouille.
I felt a compelling need to inspect my room for signs of Stuart Little. My snack drawer, which had been mostly cleaned out before break, was unharmed. The single pack of FlyBy Oreos in the drawer was still whole, wrapper included. And it’s hard to not eat a pack of Oreos when you find one. So with reasonable confidence, I came to the conclusion that Stuart’s exploration of our suite did not include my room.
So I brushed my teeth and changed into my pajamas. I had washed my sheets right before leaving for break, and I would fall asleep comforted by the lingering scent of Tide pod. I peeled my blanket back, ready to climb into my bed, and
BLACK SESAME SEEDS. EVERYWHERE.
BLACK. 
SESAME.
SEEDS. 
And given that we do not have a kitchen, a spice rack, or any reason for keeping sesame seeds in our suite, it can be reasonably inferred that the sesame seeds were definitely NOT sesame seeds.
If you haven’t put the pieces together yet: Yes, friends. Distressingly enough, Stuart slept peacefully like Goldilocks and then SHIT in my bed.
It’s been a week and a sheet wash since this encounter. And while I appreciate the validation that my bed is comfortable, I continue to feel DEEPLY VIOLATED by the thought of Stuart going potty and then shimmying around under my covers.
There have since been a few sightings of a small brown blurry running through our suite. And while I hope he steers clear of my mouse trap and lives a long and happy life, I will continue to sleep with one eye open, in case Stuart decides to make my bed his toilet again. Especially when I am in it.
The End.

At around 9:30 a.m., performers from the Boston Chinese Free Masons Athletic Club started shuffling outside the martial arts center in preparation for the parade.
Models of traditional Chinese weapons including the Dao, or broadsword, and Shuangshou Ji, or double-handed halberd, are often used during lion dance performances.
The parade began at the intersection of Beech St. and Harrison Ave. Each of the eight lion dance troupes performed in front of the crowd, then filed out in different directions to perform at each storefront in Chinatown.
The color of the lions signify their age and character: imperial yellow lions, or lau pei lions, are considered the eldest and represent liveliness and wisdom.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 delivered an address to the crowd, wishing everyone a prosperous Lunar New Year and encouraging spectators to visit local shops and restaurants after the parade.
During the performances, lions gobbled up and spit out heads of lettuce and accepted red envelopes. This practice of cai qing — plucking the greens — is thought to bring good luck and fortune.


Child lion dancers — who performed alongside older dancers — were donned in red or black lion costumes, which signify the youthful and more combative lion cubs.

During the parade, many spectators lined up in front of local eateries, including the Ho Yuen Bakery.
The lion dance troupes stopped in front of each store in Chinatown, bowing three times for respect and then entering the store to metaphorically bring good luck and business in the new year.
From 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Boston’s Chinatown neighborhood was filled with a cacophony of drums, firecrackers, dancing, and good spirits.
