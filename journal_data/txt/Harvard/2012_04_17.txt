After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unexpected guest showed up to a panel discussion on April 12 about the rich history of jazz’s preeminent recording label, Blue Note Records. Celebrated saxophonist and jazz composer Joe Lovano joined Ingrid Monson, Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music, Michael Heller, a PhD Candidate in the Department of Music, and lead discographer of Blue Note Records, Michael Cuscuna for the event.  Lovano was every bit the eccentric musician—sporting a beret and tea shades—as he attempted to bow out of the impromptu invitation to join the panel. “I don’t want to crowd the space,”  he said. The three discussants eagerly called him up, with Heller insisting, “You’re part of the history!”  To which Cuscuna laughingly shot back, “Yeah, you’re that old.”
In the historical context, however, both Cuscuna and Lovano are relative newcomers to Blue Note Records. The label was officially founded in 1939, when jazz-obsessed German immigrant Alfred Lion and photographer Francis Wolff decided to create a label with the purpose of recording of “hot jazz” and swing. The pure creative force of the burgeoning genre inspired Lion. “Hot jazz...is expression and communication, a musical and social manifestation—and Blue Note Records [is] concerned with identifying its impulse,” he wrote in the label’s first brochure.
Harvard’s Office for the Arts has attempted to capture the spirit of Lion’s pioneering enthusiasm with a sprawling yearlong tribute, “Blue Note Records: Then and Now.” The panel discussion was part of the week-long finale to the homage. In addition to the discussion, the OFA worked with the local Brattle Theater to screen the documentary, “Blue Note: A Story of Modern Jazz,” and curated a small exhibition of Wolff’s black and white portraits from Blue Note’s early days in the Holyoke Center.
The culmination of the celebration occurred on Saturday in Sanders Theater with “Blue Note Records: It Must Schwing!” a concert that featured performances from Lovano and fellow Blue Note recording artist, Greg Osby.  In this final week, The OFA built upon their yearlong homage, diving fully into the rich past of Blue Note in an attempt to connect its vivid history with the present jazz scene.
During the panel discussion, Cuscuna was disarmingly casual as he spoke about Blue Note’s astounding collection of artists. In its early days, the label produced albums by giants in the genre, men who redefined the scene, including Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock, Miles Davis, and Harvey Nickels.  After its heyday, however, Blue Notes came on hard times and might have disappeared altogether if not for Charlie Lourie and Cuscuna, who began the painstaking process of reissuing old pieces and releasing unheard sessions from Blue Note’s vaults.
The process of issuing unheard sessions was at once exhilarating and grueling for Cuscuna. He described the first time he was allowed into Blue Note’s vault. “[It] was both the greatest and the worst day of my life...the whole room was shelving, all dedicated to unissued Blue Note tapes. What I had to do was listen to an entire session, start to finish...and little by little piece together who was on it...[it was] really grueling detective work.”
The integrity of the artist is, and has always been, the cornerstone of Blue Note Records’ philosophy.  During Saturday’s concert in Sanders Theater, Tom Everett, the director of Harvard’s “Monday Jazz Band” described the relationship between Blue Note and its artists. “[They] took artists and encouraged them to do their thing, not to be told what to do...they took a great risk—for the music.”
Indeed, the unique relationship between Blue Note Records and its artists was most clearly revealed by the choice to dedicate Saturday’s concert to the memory of Sam Rivers, a Blue Note recording artist and producer who passed away in December of last year. Cuscuna and Lovano alike spoke warmly of Rivers during the concert. “There was nobody like him—he was an unstoppable creative force. He could exhaust you and seduce you at the same time,” Cuscuna said.
Ultimately, the spirit of Rivers and others like him are at the heart of Blue Note’s legacy. Harvard College and the Office for the Arts at Harvard devoted a year to the celebration of the pioneering record label, honoring the unique sounds of hot jazz and boogie-woogie and the Blue Note artists who defined and then redefined those genres. In the final week, the artists and discographers themselves arrived on campus to sing the praises of the recording company, bringing the sounds of the early days of Blue Note into the present scene as they played and spoke alongside Harvard student groups the Sunday and Monday Jazz Bands, respectively. In the ever-evolving world of popular jazz, Blue Note retains a respect and admiration for the raw art. As Cuscuna said of his reissuing work for Blue Note’s earliest sessions, “I was smart enough to leave [the music] alone. People said, ‘you did a great job on this.’ Well, all I did was not destroy it.”

A shadow that takes over a man’s life, monsters lurching across the stage, theological allusions—these are components of bad horror films. However, when they are applied to the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of the new work “Monstrous Doubles: Two New Plays,” these seemingly kitschy themes actually facilitate discussions of existence and fantasy. The show combines two one-act pieces: “The House of Shadows”—written and directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson staff writer—and “[] Monster”—written by Daniel J. Giles ’13 and directed by Giles and Mariel N. Pettee ’14. The infectious energy of the cast, coupled with their impressive use of physical acting techniques, brings to light the grotesque side of human nature. This visual exploration of both plays themes raises questions of what it means to be an individual in modern society.
“The House of Shadows” follows the life of a struggling writer, billed in the play as the Learned Man (Peter K. Bestoso ’14), who longs to be remembered, both as a writer but also as a human being. He claims that a former lover was the only thing that made him feel alive. His shadow (Bryan D. Kauder ’14) acts as a physical manifestation of the writer’s hopes and dreams so can experience life in a way that the agoraphobic writer cannot. “[] Monster”—based off of Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein”— combines drama and dance to explore how the dichotomy of monstrosity and humanity can be embodied in the same person.
“The House of Shadows” is heavily influenced by the work and life stories of both Danish writer Hans Christian Anderson and American playwright Charles Mee. Anderson’s short story “The Shadow”—which provided McTaggart’s play with its name—deals with issues of belonging and loss of innocence, and this dualism is brilliantly embodied by McTaggart’s direction. The Shadow is caught by a desperate desire to experience life independently from the Learned Man, but does not know how to do this. Just like a shadow, Kauder mimics Bestoso’s actions, in one scene moving perfectly in sync with his fellow actor. As the play progresses, he breaks free from Bestoso and begins to move of his own accord. McTaggart’s decision to visually demonstrate the link between the two characters was made all the more effective in the scene in which this connection is severed and the Shadow becomes a full-fledged person.
Kauder brilliantly embodied both the new powers and limitations his character experiences when becoming human. His gestures conveyed both the power and fear that comes with forming your own independent existence. When he finally breaks free of his reliance on the Man, Kauder reveals the inner turmoil his character is struggling with through movements as subtle as the twinge of his jaw.
The two halves of “Monstrous Doubles” are connected by an audio recording of a thunderstorm that plays both at the end of “The House of Shadows” and the beginning of “[] Monster.” The characters in the second show are almost as wild as the thunderstorm that precedes them. The actors move convincingly like animals, crawling on the floor and snarling as if infected with rabies. The energy in the cast is astounding. Every swoon and pounce is perfectly in time with the soundtrack, and each movement is synchronized with the music, and each expression filled with emotional intensity. The actors play off of one another as if the entire cast was one organic entity. They complement each other’s movements, matching the sensual ebb and flow of each other’s actions. Moments that usually would seem banal become charged with sexual energy, to the point that even the actors grabbing each other’s scalps is made erotic.
All the actors do a phenomenal job, but Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13—who, like the entire cast of “[] Monster” plays a character named “[]”—is especially impressive, playing a savage creature as well as a child with a lisp. Interspersed with leapfrogging and imaginative prose, the references to innocence are again an appropriate echo of the previous play—in which the Learned Man bemoans the fact that he has lost the carefree nature of his youth—although now in an entirely different context. While in “Shadows,” the graceful lines have a twinge of sorrow to them, in “Monster” all pain is overwhelmed by the beauty of the dancing and physical acting. Even unbearably violent scenes were gorgeously done, the frequent retching and strangling noises adding to a sense of the grotesque nature of humanity.
Between leading a blind man to walk and referencing scripture with lines like, “You may be my creator but I am your master,” there was indubitably an undertone of religious allusion in “Monsters” and “Shadows.” Both deal with elements of power and self-worth, of existence and what it means to be real if not validated by others. While each show takes a very different spin on these questions of existence, both are extremely passionate and powerful new productions that illuminate existential aspects of humanity.

“All that pink you’re wearing…is that even legal?” asked Vivienne Kensington, a condescending Harvard Law School student, and a character in “Legally Blonde; The Musical.” The Law School and its stereotypically drab student body would prove to be no match for the effervescent and stylish Elle Woods, the main character in the show. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s rendition of the popular Harvard tale—which was directed and choreographed by Haley L. Bennett ’13 and Alex M. Willis ’14—provided a farcical view one of the country’s most prestigious academic institutions. The production, which ran from April 12 to April 15, boasted a strong cast that, through the actors’ energetic performances, poked fun both at Harvard’s status and at the stereotypical “dumb blonde.” This self-awareness factored heavily into the production’s overall success, despite a number of technical setbacks during the show.
“Legally Blonde: The Musical” follows vapid sorority girl Elle Woods (Lily R. Glimcher ’14) as she journeys from the steps of UCLA’s Delta Nu house to the hallowed halls of Harvard Law School to win back her one true love, Warner Huntington III (Adam J. Conner ’14, a Crimson business editor). With the help of her friends, Paulette (Amy K. Sparrow ’15) and Emmett (Anise Molina ’14), Woods soon finds that she has what it takes to win a murder trial and succeed in one of the nation’s best law schools. “What, like it’s hard?” says Woods nonchalantly when reminded of the difficulty of gaining admission to Harvard.
The ensemble as a whole was nothing short of excellent. The cast’s strong vocals enhanced the already engaging script, and bright, airy songs set the tone for the show. The portrayal of Woods’ law professor by Eric Padilla ’14 was particularly impressive: he was able to convincingly imitate the demeanor of a morally reprehensible and egomaniacal lawyer while still delivering one of the best vocal performances in the production. Padilla, Sparrow, and Molina gave distinctly inspired performances—so much so that they overshadowed Glimcher—the lead—for most of the show. But it was the collective strength of the cast that made the production flourish. In addition to stellar vocal numbers, the cast also succeeded in translating the humor in the musical from the script page to the main stage. The combination of perfect comedic timing and an element of self-deprecation—think Harvardians in tweed jackets with English accents—provided a whole slew of jokes that brought the house down.
The show also boasted a tremendous amount of energy, which was due in part to Bennett and Willis’s choreography. Musical numbers like “What You Want” and “Whipped Into Shape” required a large number of actors to complete a complex series of steps in unison—a challenge that the cast not only executed, but knocked out of the park. In “Whipped Into Shape,” jailbirds and exercise junkies performed an intense workout routine and jumped ropes with militaristic precision. The perfect execution of this choreography added to the fun of the production and ratcheted up the energy to the musical without making the action seem too chaotic. Not all of the energy came from the dancing: the show also includes real dogs in the production. Dakota Allen (Woods’ dog Bruiser) and Molly Yum (Paulette’s dog Rufus) never ceased to excite as they ran across the stage and dutifully play their parts as attentive and cute canine companions.
Though the cast gave a rousing performance, an element of this achievement was lost due to microphone issues and sometimes clumsy transitions between scenes. It was difficult to hear some of the dialogue between Woods and Huntington in the beginning of the production, so elements of the not-so-tragic breakup of the two were completely lost. On more than one occasion, one of the walls of the set crashed against something on stage during a scene change—mishaps that, although they did not interfere with the action on stage, did prove to be distracting.
“Legally Blonde: The Musical” was a fun and funny reboot of the movie with the same name. An excellent cast, adorable dogs, and well-coordinated jump rope routines allowed the HRDC’s production to bring Woods’ sparkle and shine back to Harvard, and liven up her journey toward becoming, as she says,  “someone serious, someone lawyerly—someone who wears black when nobody’s dead!”

Hair
April 26-27, 7:30 p.m.,
April 27-28, 2:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Ex
Directed by
Katherine L. Price ’14
Produced by Simon A. De Carvalho ’14
and David C. Manella ’14
Sex, drugs, and protest music are coming to Harvard. In the upcoming production of the rock musical “Hair”—which explores the cultural, sexual, and political revolutions of the sixties—an inventive cast and crew updates the show’s original political message for a modern audience. It centers on a group of hippies living in New York during the height of the Vietnam War who are resisting the draft in the midst of personal, societal, and familial pressures.
The importance of this show to our current political climate is palpable. “We chose to do this show last semester, the day the Occupy tents went up in the yard,” says producer David C. Manella ’14. Manella says that the show will not only deal with social movements from the 1960s, but also with issues  that are relevant to a modern day audience. For example, cast members will hold picket signs about Proposition 8 and the Trayvon Martin case in the protest scenes.
The production will also draw heavily on the work of Diane Paulus ’88, the current Artistic Director of the American Repertory Theater who, before her tenure at the A.R.T., directed the Tony Award Winning revival of “Hair” in 2009. She met with the group to discuss her approach to the play. “She talked to us a lot about eye contact,” says actor Mark J. Mauriello ’15. For her, eye contact is a crucial technique that connects the action onstage to the audience. “You should show your appreciation to other people in the world, and be open to receiving things from other people; and basically take part in a bigger collective experience,” he says.
Director Katherine L. Price ’14 emphasizes the importance of the space of the Loeb Ex itself in highlighting both the political message of the show and this productions emphasis on audience involvement. This is because the intimate nature of the theater allows the cast members to interact with the audience without the sort of restrictions usually found in a more traditionally designed space, such as a clear distinction between the stage and the seats. “I really wanted to focus on audience interaction.... A lot of the numbers are really focused on being in the audience, which is really cool and not doable in any other space on campus,” said Price.
The interactive nature of the production is a technical choice that will compound the musical’s historical and modern message, but these decisions might also affect the audience in surprising ways. “If you come to the show, we will sit on you,” says Mauriello.

“No man ever believes that the Bible means what it says,” George Bernard Shaw once said. “He is always convinced that it says what he means.” These varied interpretations inevitably lead to conflict, both emotional and political; one need look no further than the rivalling Biblical claims over ownership of Jerusalem. In “Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City,” Canadian cartoonist and author Guy Delisle successfully portrays the political woes of Israel with a wise and well-researched perspective, built upon his own experiences in the city. In his fifth graphic novel and memoir, he enlivens Israel beyond its ever-present place on a newsstand. Through the concise visual imagery, the powerful perspective of an outsider, and the narrative that attempts to honestly reflect the quotidian struggles of those impacted by the Arab-Israel conflict, Delisle’s latest travelogue is an eye-opening glimpse into a conflict more famous for its headlines than its human dimension.
Delisle, the husband of a travelling member of Doctors Without Borders, spends his free time documenting his adventures in exotic and politically treacherous locales. His cartoons include the light humor that enlivens day-to-day happenings—including memorizing various religious holidays and grocery store schedules—and darker moments that portray the ever-present danger that surrounds him in Israel. Delisle has already written about Pyongyang, Burma, and Shenzhen in previous graphic novels, and his experience in this unique travelogue style serves him well as he attempts to navigate the political and ethnic tensions of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Combining elements of a memoir with a graphic novel is a relatively recent method of writing within the traditionally entertainment-oriented medium of comics. “Jerusalem: Chronicles” is drawn in a style reminiscent of the “Spy vs. Spy” comic strips; it includes elaborate backdrops, and its attention to significant detail places the reader in unfamiliar territory that is softened by a fellow tourist’s highly observant eye. The graphic novel streamlines narrative detail, thanks to the intersection of visual and textual imagery—here, a picture often is worth several lines of descriptive detail. Delisle never textually describes the blandly consistent Israeli desert, which reappears in every travel scene between Gaza and the West Bank. Instead, his illustrations allow the reader’s attention to dwell on the dialogue that progresses the narration. Ultimately, this dialogue, in conjunction with Delisle’s amateur reporting on the current conflict between Israel and Palestine, enhances the tension as the conflict spills over into everyday lives. A Christmas bombing in Gaza prevents families from peacefully celebrating the holiday; security checkpoints are mandatory upon entering locations as innocuous as a shopping mall—incidents like these form a snapshot of the jarring interruption this conflict has on the lives of those even tangentially involved.
Whereas most would think of comics as the purview of kids and subscribers of Sunday newspapers, Delisle’s work is clearly directed at a more grown-up audience, due to language, subject matter, and comedic subtlety. Between days of menial wandering and housekeeping, Delisle witnessed key moments in the development of Palestinian territory. The novel follows a chronological pattern: Chapters are demarcated by month of the year, August to July, and further subdivided into episodes of major events therein. This structure helps to facilitate a continuous narrative, a necessary aspect in conveying such ambiguous events. Things follow chronologically, rather than in a contrived conceptualization, which forms an honest reflection of Delisle’s disorienting experiences in a foreign land.
Though Delisle takes an innovative approach in describing his adventure, predictable travel-guide elements do appear in the work—yet their effect is more helpful than clichéd. He inserts a variety of clarifying maps, which prove indispensable to making sense of such a convoluted political landscape. These maps often reflect the sometimes arbitrary boundaries claimed and drawn between multiple ethnic groups all vying for control of various areas of Israel. Delisle, himself a tourist in a foreign land, contextualizes his evolving perception and experience in his temporary home as he tries, repeatedly and with varying degrees of success, to overcome bureaucratic boundaries in his attempts to visit contested religious locations. “I swear, when you see the spectacle religion puts on around here, you don’t feel like being a believer,” Delisle says with exasperation as he tries to circumvent yet another restriction in place due to fighting.
The novel’s greatest triumph results from its outsider perspective in a land of endemic distrust. Delisle, along with a variety of foreigners all working to promote Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, tries to live neutrally amongst Muslims, Christians, Jews, and politically opinionated atheists, each trying to establish their control of the Holy Land. Delisle’s initial ignorance and frequent confusion reflect the baffling intricacies of Gazan citizenship and military mobilization, not to mention borders and their international legitimacy. Yet the limited scope of Delisle’s perspective begs further research on the part of the intrigued reader. In “Jerusalem,” he provides a multifaceted experience that is both informative and entertaining as he tries to make sense of a murky and complex situation. In trying to stay neutral and fairly portray modern Israel, he aligns himself—perhaps unwittingly—with the reader in a modern crusade for truth.

Nothing breaks fraternal bonds more than stabbing your brother in the back and leaving him out to dry—literally.  But what happens if he refuses to die? Fratricide is at the center of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Cain and Cain,” a new work written and directed by Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13. The play—which is running at the Loeb Ex through April 21—illustrates the strained ties between two brothers, Chad and Michael, as they both come to terms with the consequences of the unequal love they received from their mother. Through innovative set design and striking acting, “Cain and Cain” weaves together themes of family, love, and death and alludes to the biblical story of the brothers Cain and Abel.
The play follows the struggle of younger brother Michael (Benjamin J. Lorenz ’14) in his attempts to gain the affection of his mother (Darcy C. Donelan ’14.) Despite these efforts, their mother continues to make her overwhelming preference for Chad (Daniel W. Erickson ’14) clear. Out of spite, Michael poisons Chad, stabs him with their mother’s knife, and then carries his body to the top of a cliff. However, Chad refuses to die and instead continues to make Michael’s life miserable. After the disappearance of his brother, Michael still cannot win his mother’s affection, as she honors Chad’s memory by caring for dogs that bear his name.
Vogelman wrote a complicated script that not only brings together multiple themes but also uses several literary devices. The storyline features neither a clear protagonist nor a linear plot. The play’s focus continually shifts from the Michael to the mother to Chad to all three together. Vogelman’s script makes great use of soliloquies that, through their poetic quality, adds a level of depth to the characters and challenges preconceived notions of good and evil. For example, in one self-reflexive moment Chad admits that through killing him, Michael was able to do for him what Chad would never have the courage to do for himself. Suddenly murder become an act that frees Chad from his overbearing mother, and labeling one brother as ‘good’ and the other ‘bad’ becomes much less straightforward. Through these soliloquies Vogelman adds depth to the story by showcasing different individual sentiments and the consequences of the interplay of these emotions.
The familial themes at the heart of “Cain and Cain” are brought to life through the physicality of the acting, and the actors’ different intonations of voice compliment their personal stake in the storyline. For example, Lorenz’s pleading and defeated tone represents his continued failure to gain the love of his mother, Erickson employs a sure and almost mocking sonority that reflects a life of being favored, and Donelanswitches her voice—which ranges from sweet and caressing to biting and exasperated—to make her favoritism clear. Even the way the characters carry themselves helps tell the story. Chad moves nonchalantly and with a sense of self-assuredness. It is as if his every step reveals his knowledge of his mother’s favoritism. Michael is often found hunched or with his head hung, attempting to evade his mother’s rebukes. And the mother shuffles from place to place as if on edge, caught between equally intense love and hatred for her sons.
Depth is also added by the innovative set design of the stage. Audience members are seated in the center of the set, so that the action of the play encircles them. In this way, the audience members are literally submerged in the story. Each backdrop—such as a kitchen table or a cabbage patch—is set up around the audience, and as a result the action flows seamlessly from scene to scene. This design increases the pace of the play as the story unfolds around the audience with no breaks between the action. It allows the audience to take in the “Cain and Cain” in its entirety, in a way disabling the onlookers from becoming mentally removed by totally immersing them in the action.
“Cain and Cain” plays with its biblical namesake through unique uses of literary and visual media. The religious allusions dictate the actions of each character, with even the monologues becoming more like confessionals. And through Vogelman’s use of soliloquies, the lines of good and bad become blurred as each character cannot help but admit his or her own sins. By allowing for depth to be translated through the script, acting, and set, “Cain and Cain” presents a well-crafted modern exploration into the complications of brotherhood.

George Pocheptsov, world-renown artist and full-time student, is not just the child prodigy that some wish to be—he is a child preserved in a professional’s body. His paintings are striking illustrations of fairytale scenes done too exquisitely to be found in any children’s book.
His work has been exhibited in prestigious museums, the United Nations, and even the living rooms of United States Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Hillary Clinton. His appeal is huge and his fame legendary. He learned to draw before he could talk, and was discovered by age six. Pocheptsov has since continued to perfect his rare gift.
Although his artwork has undergone bouts of change and development over the years, his whimsical artistic spirit has gone uncorrupted and unhampered, making it a cause for ceaseless creativity. Pocheptsov gives life and form to the richly cultivated landscape of his inner dream-world, populated with oddly-shaped figures, mystical creatures, colorful characters, and boundless heart using acrylics of myriad colors and self-invented “sculptured canvases” of different angles.. His paintings, whether depicting an endemic Adam and Eve paradise (“Unicorn Garden”), a children’s charity goal (“Carousel”), a political message (“Celebration of Hope”), or a masterful classical revival (“Primavera”), have a common eye-popping dynamism and a unique drama to them. In describing his own evolution as an artist, Pocheptsov says, “I see in my earlier paintings a lack of color balance and gradients. Now I am working for more complex figures, intricate detail, and a fluid motion of color,” which means, above all, “no white space.” Yet, however much he experiments with mixing new paints and sketching more studies (up to dozens for the same painting), he will not compromise on two scores: “Every artwork has to have a story and an intuition behind them,” says Popcheptsov.
Unlike the Surrealists and Expressionists, Picasso and Chagall, Pocheptsov strives to make the unfamiliar familiar by tapping into people’s underlying recognition of imaginative forms. “Creativity is a wonderful thing,” Pocheptsov said, “especially if you can express it so that someone else can understand it. The way you do it is by taking the realistic components from life that they can relate to.” The youthful creator has a generous faith in people’s capacity to appreciate art, even if they cannot all be artists. “Everybody loves surreal colors, blossoming characters, [and] playful diversion.... My painting is a portal that people can go into and imagine.” In this sense, he is not only an artist, but a humanitarian as well. Pocheptsov’s foundation has donated over five million dollars to charities by auctioning off his work.
The young artist has remained faithful to the child within him in spite of his fame. He found that the key to success lies in this type of free creative expression. He admits that his imaginative fire would have probably died out had his early success not fanned the flame. But he has had the courage to stay the course of his individual artistic direction, eschewing all aid from those who think they know better. Pocheptsov was completely self-taught. Although he visits museums regularly, enjoys learning new art forms, and admires the masters, he does not rely on their influence or instruction. “There is no scholarly literature behind what I do,” he said. “It is just there, and that is why people appreciate it.” That is not to say that there is not method to his talent.
In many ways, being his own boss is difficult. “You have to constantly push the frontier further and further until you can come up with something that is completely different,” he said. And if he occasionally falls behind on a commission, it is only because he takes on so many at once. Sometimes he will be working on over 20 paintings at a time, putting projects on hold and resuming them whenever he is inspired again. “That’s how humans are meant to think: in spurts. Most people ignore bouts of inspiration because they are too caught up in deadlines,” he says. His unique artistic process gives people a taste of what life would be like in the wild of the unconscious.
This approach sounds fine on the surface, but does it hold up in practice, especially in the Harvard jungle? Pocheptsov has advice for re-imagining this arena, as well. Instead of measuring peers in a straight competitive lineup, one can situate them spatially—as in a painting—where each object has its logical, separate place in the whole. In this vein, he sees Harvard’s academic departments as complete entities in their own right, which he likes to participate in at his pleasure. The result of such thinking yields a hybrid species more exotic than the creatures in his paintings: part professional artist, part statistics concentrator, part polo player, George Pocheptsov is all-embracing.

Ghost Box Orchestra’s recording studio is an abandoned freemason lodge. The space is dimly lit, and the walls are covered in intricate hieroglyphic designs and colorful molding. The huge space holds, among other things, an eclectic collection of instruments, a worn-down couch, stacks of unmarked boxes, and a half bottle of Listerine mouthwash. The only thing resembling a typical studio is the large constructed box in the middle of the space, which holds the paradoxically modern and high-tech control room. This box is not only wildly unexpected but also a little eerie, which is perfect for a band that named itself after a ghost hunting show on television.
“When Chris and I went out looking at studios, we went around to a bunch of places, and when we were here, two feet in the door, it was like, ‘This is it,’” says Jeremy Lassetter, of the band’s guitarists. Lassetter and fellow guitarist Christopher Johnson show me how they usually set up the studio, and Lassetter plays a few notes on a pink toy keyboard. “We haven’t used this yet,” he says jokingly. However, given the Lassetter and Johnson’s daring musical sensibilities, it wouldn’t be surprising if they did use something so unconventional.
This five-man band, consisting of Lassetter, Johnson, keyboardist Nazli Green, drummer Martin Rex, and bassist Dennis Noble, formed in 2008. Since then, they have steadily risen in the Boston music scene, with their innovative instrumentals and psychedelic beats. This past year, GBO was named one of Boston’s 12 Best New Bands by the Boston Phoenix. Lassetter, originally from Texas, and Johnson, from Utah, had been producing independent music and playing with various bands for several years prior to moving to Boston. “I was playing with anybody I could play with,” says Johnson about his pre-GBO musical career. A conceptually ambitious guitarist, he was immediately impressed with Lassetter’s work when the two met in Boston. “I listened to [Lassetter’s] stuff and was like, ‘Oh this is cool, I could definitely play with this stuff.’ It’s minimal in a way that gives me a lot of room.”
Ghost Box Orchestra’s music possesses few vocal melodies, and instead relies on the musicians’ dense layering of guitars, drums, keyboard, and bass. The band deftly mixes this standard setup with a range of miscellaneous instruments to create an amalgam of sound that is influenced by space rock, krautrock, spaghetti western, and other genres of psychedelic rock. “‘What if we had an orchestra setup that was all channeling bits and pieces of different sounds?’” says Lassetter about his conception of GBO. “That’s what I wanted to do with music.”
Sitting with the guitarists, I can hear pieces of their new track being played and edited in the control room by their producer. Although it is muffled, the track possesses a constancy and energy that is both laid-back and uplifting. “It’s gotten louder and spacier,” says Lassetter about the evolution of the band’s sound. “Everything I did for demos was all acoustic guitars and really clean electric guitars. And with the five people together we realized that this is going to get loud real quick, and we just went with it.”
Hanging out with Johnson and Lassetter, it is clear that they have a strong bond as bandmates. “It just feels better when everyone’s playing together, and there’s not like that ‘James Brown type’ in the group,” says Johnson. Recounting memories of Psychfest Music Festival in Austin, Texas, and an open-air show in Louisiana, Lassetter and Johnson sometimes have more of a conversation with each other than they do with me. Throughout the session, the two bounce musical ideas off of each other, often referencing memories or inside band jokes.
Just before we enter into the control room to get a better listen of the new tracks, we discuss the band’s aspirations. Because it is influenced by so many genres, GBO has the freedom to manipulate and innovate its sound. “I think that it would be interesting to swing us a little more away from the western front and focus a little more on the eastern,” says Johnson. “You know, without doing too much of either, implementing more groove, more polyrhythmic stuff. I’d like to see it get a little quicker and a little more ass-shaking without being dance-y.” Lassetter nods in agreement.
The control room is full of professional recording equipment. It’s about ten degrees warmer in here than it was outside. Lassetter, Johnson, and I sit back on a couch and watch the band’s producer move around a bunch of levers to mix the music. “We’re just going to be flies on the wall,” says Lassetter. For the next 20 minutes or so, we sit in relative silence, taking in the music. It’s repetitive without being boring, ethereal and slightly unnatural, and wholly infectious. It’s clear that the band has come a long way from Lassetter’s acoustic guitar demos.
Listening to the recording gives me good sense of Ghost Box Orchestra’s musical identity; the band hits all ranges of sound, from loud, crashing drums to mellow bass to the occasional chime and tambourine. They take pride in their adventurous textures and will continue to experiment as they progress in the Boston music scene. As Johnson puts it, they’re “turning up the bump.”

Spiritualized frontman Jason Pierce provides perhaps the finest example of the musical benefits of using drugs. Ever since his first band, Spacemen 3, declared itself to be “taking drugs to make music to take drugs to,” Pierce has searched for a sound that embodies chemically-abetted transcendence. Despite its adverse health effects—Pierce was recently diagnosed with long-term liver disease—this quest has conceptually and musically unified all of Spiritualized’s diverse work, which draws on genres from gospel to classic rock. As the band’s latest album makes clear, however, bland baroque pop doesn’t fit within this mission. Though Pierce remains capable of a rousing guitar rave up despite his recent illness, “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” is dominated by sluggish ballads that make the album a torpid and disjointed affair.
Some of the tracks on “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” are impeccable. Songs like the eight-minute “So Long You Pretty Thing,” which ends the album with a suitably mind-melting outro, exemplify what Spiritualized does best: entrancing repetition, heartfelt vocals, and orchestral flourishes. Such qualities are also evident in the lengthy “Heading for the Top” and the second half of the nine-minute single “Hey Jane.” Together, these two and a half songs constitute a solid 20 minutes of majestic psychedelic rock; unfortunately, those 20 minutes only make up a third of the record.
The rest of the album is given over to unremarkable, indistinguishable ballads. Until now, Pierce always managed to couple his balladeer tendencies with superb songwriting; 2008’s “Soul on Fire” was a stellar example of his ability to write a great song even without using multiple distortion pedals or a 50-piece orchestra. The languid tracks on “Sweet Heart Sweet Light,” by contrast, feature bland instrumentation that invigorates neither the boring melodies nor stunning dearth of hooks.
What ultimately sinks these ballads, however, is their inability to provide any musical justification for the record’s truly egregious lyrics, which treat subjects such as death and mortality in a shallow and insipid manner.  Without a compelling musical backdrop, Jason Pierce’s haggard and fading voice is forced to stand on its own. He lacks the necessary gravitas to successfully deliver lyrics as inane as “Sometimes I wish that I was dead,” or “Sometimes your world’s so full of pain,” both of which are from the horrid “Little Girl.” Though the thematic darkness stems from Pierce’s life-threatening health struggles, the lyrics are so poorly written and performed that they evoke pity rather than sympathy.
The more extravagant tracks do a much better job of handling this lyrical problem. “Heading for the Top,” for instance, ends with a fading chant of “Don’t let the damage show,” which would sound melodramatic if it weren’t backed up by a darkly fascinating wall of sound. Unfortunately, Pierce makes no effort to bring the two types of songs on “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” together, which creates an uneasy dichotomy. This duality is exemplified by the first single “Hey Jane,” which begins quietly and abruptly shifts into a chugging guitar excursion into cosmic infinity. Instead of smoothly integrating the two parts, Pierce fades out the first section and includes a few seconds of silence before starting the second.
Such misguided choices make it seem like Pierce isn’t quite sure what he wants out of this record, which is perhaps the most troubling thing one can say about a Spiritualized album. Though Pierce has worked with a multitude of different genres, he has always carried out his musical experiments with confidence. In contrast, “Sweet Heart Sweet Light” is defined by shaky certainty. Perhaps this is still music to take drugs too, but only because it’s so weak otherwise.

Author, editor, and Harvard alumnus Chad D. Harbach ’97 wrote his debut novel, “The Art of Fielding,” about a talented baseball player at a Division III school. He develops a psychological block preventing him from playing, but as Harbach noted in his talk at Yenching Auditorium last Monday, however, “It’s not all about baseball.” This pronouncement turned out to be an apt forecast of the rest of the talk, which was organized by Benjamin T. Hand ’12 of the Mahindra Humanities Center’s Undergraduate Committee and moderated by Madeleine M. Schwartz ’12 and Mark J. Chiusano ’12, both Crimson editors. Topics during the talk ranged from sports culture to the writing process to the joys of Melville and the influence of great books. During the hour-long event, Harbach spoke with humor and surprising candor, given his recent rise to fame.
“Most sports novels are pretty bad,” Harbach said, before explaining why he chose to make his first book about sports—and stick with it through the 11-year writing process. He acknowledged the similarities between the block his character faced and the struggles of a writer: “If you are a writer, you are going through this sort of thing every day, but in baseball it happens in this very public way. You can see the player’s thought process laid bare.” This is just one of the similarities between athletes and artists, according to Harbach. “I went about the book thinking of good athletes as artists,” he said. “In a way I think that sports have become a preeminent art in our culture.”
Harbach is not only a novelist, but also an editor and writer at the literary magazine n+1, which he helped found in 2004 alongside a crop of other Harvard graduates. He writes about topics that range from sports gossip to politics in the magazine and has recently developed a writing interest in ecology and climate change. This apparent flexibility is an important reason why “The Art of Fielding” traverses more ground than just baseball. “If you are writing only about what happens in the game,” he said, “then that is just sports porn.” He wanted the novel to examine richer material than the playing field alone. “There is a whole spectrum of possible relationships between [the characters], from antagonistic and competitive relations to profound friendship to sexual relations. So the book is about how you move across this spectrum.”
Hand characterized Harbach’s book as “a great American novel about baseball and about life in America.” During the discussion, the book drew comparison to “Moby Dick,” whose author, Herman Melville, was an inspiration for the protagonist of “The Art of Fielding.” Harbach first encountered Melville in a seminar he took as an undergraduate. According to Harbach, “Moby Dick” guided “The Art of Fielding” through its singular focus on the relationship between “dudes.” Harbach attempted to pay homage to the influence and themes of Melville but took his writing down a different route, as well. “Moby Dick is the quintessential American novel, but in the book I make it comic in a certain way,” Harbach said. “You do not want to write a story and be constantly reminding people there is a better story they could be reading.”
Harbach also shed light on the process of becoming a writer after college, a topic that, based on the questions asked during the talk, was of great interest for much of the audience. “I never took a writing class when I was here,” he said. “Writing fiction just seemed like something no one could tell me that I could not do.” Nevertheless, it was not an easy process: “Very early on I had to teach myself how to write a book,” he said. “When I was an undergrad, I was not writing fiction. I felt overwhelmed enough by classes. There were maybe two writing workshops, and I felt like they were for people of a much loftier literary status than me.” This was one of the key points of the talk, said Hand: “It was a good lesson for those who might be interested in writing but do not feel that they have had the proper instruction here. He showed it is something you can pursue even if you were not comfortable doing it as an undergraduate.”
Chiusano mentioned that there is a planned HBO series based on the book. “It is interesting that it would not be a movie, that it would be a part of this new trend,” he said. Harbach sheepishly expressed a lack of knowledge about TV shows but pointed out the similarities between long novels and a series: “What has always appealed to me about the novel is that you spend a lot of hours reading this book and you have this durable experience. I think TV can replicate parts of that which a movie cannot.” He hasn’t visualized much beyond the first steps of the series, however; when asked who his dream cast would include, Harbach laughed and invited the audience to make suggestions.
Harbach’s talk remained consistently engaging because he let the discussion reflect his own life, in which many things are important and nothing is overwhelmingly paramount. Though his novel is about baseball and he admitted to feeling guilty about the amount of time he devotes to sports fandom, he also discussed the pros and cons of the fact that many writers in the last century have been educated by or have taught in a Master of Fine Arts program. He made it clear that baseball was one of his projects but not his entire interest. Through his opinionated humor and animated advice, Harbach proved that, in artistic wealth, it pays to be a polymath.

It is often said that great artists suffer for their work. Few artists can attest to that claim as well as Iraqi-born Wafaa Bilal, who lived for one year with a camera surgically implanted into the back of his head. This camera streamed images non-stop to the internet. This performance—cleverly titled “the 3rdi”—was a commentary on the prevalence of surveillance and monotony in modern life.
On Thursday, April 12, Bilal joined Beau Bothwell, doctoral candidate in Music at Columbia University, and Alberto Pepe Gentile, information scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in the Carpenter Center’s Sert Gallery for a lively panel discussion about the body as a site of artistic expression. The event was part of the Carpenter Center’s Bring Your Own: Voices of the Contemporary series, which has brought dozens of emerging artists, thinkers, curators, and innovators into conversation with one another.
Bilal, who now works as a professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, creates art that is strongly influenced by his Iraqi identity.  He left Iraq in 1991 to escape oppression under the Saddam Hussein regime. “I consider myself existing in two places,” said Bilal, speaking of his turbulent past. “One is a comfort zone and one is a conflict zone. As an artist, there is always a desire to bridge these two places.”
In 2007, following the death of his brother in Iraq during the US occupation, Bilal created a controversial performance installation entitled “Domestic Tension.” The installation acted as a bridge between those experiencing the conflict and those who simply observed it. “This project tried to connect my viewers to the conflict zone using mobile devices with a very clear objective; that is, to engage, but not to create a didactic encounter,” Bilal said.
For a month, Bilal lived within range of a loaded paintball gun in a Chicago gallery. The gun was connected to the internet, and online participants could aim and shoot it as they wished. Bilal uploaded daily video diaries recorded within this self-imposed “warzone.” He also let users chat with each other on the site. “The body is a central element,” he said. “I played with the idea of being vulnerable and induced that vulnerability in my viewers as well. That connects them on a different level other than a cerebral one.”
Thirty-one days and 65,000 paint bullets later, the gallery was completely destroyed. Bilal recalled the smell of the fish-oil-based paint and the sight of yellow pigment all over the walls. The project brought forth an unexpected reaction from the public: people donated money to buy paintballs, came to the gallery to keep Bilal company, and even formed an online “Virtual Human Shield” in which users logged on and aimed the gun away from the artist.
In a related project, Bilal had the cities of Iraq tattooed on his back and then overlaid them with thousands of dots representing Iraqi and American casualties. These dots were tattooed in invisible ink. Under UV light, Bilal’s back becomes a map of the human cost of the war. “I think that [this masochism] comes from the idea that the body has its own language,” Bilal said. “There is a long history of performance artists using their bodies. It’s not that I want to hurt myself or that I like the pain but that I want to connect my viewers to larger issues.”
Gentile provided another perspective on the idea of bodies as forms of artistic identity. He focused on the spatial organization in airports. The layout of the airport encourages movement and shopping; benches are designed to make it impossible to lay down, and gates are announced at the last possible moments. According to Gentile, airports are just like prisons. Passengers are essentially tagged with  information about their destination and identity, and the task of the airport is to match their flesh bodies against their digital bodies. “Airport passengers are constantly watched and managed, which increases [their] alienation and disembodiment,” Gentile said. He adds that airports are also a site of class stratification because they are divided into admiral’s clubs and first class lounges that separate those who can afford to pay more from the majority who fly economy.
Gentile cited pat-down exams, strip searches, and full body scans as evidence that airport security has “reached a point of…dehumanization.” He told a story of a woman passing through airport security, cupcake in hand, who was compelled to relinquish her sugary snack on the grounds that it contained an unacceptable quantity of gel-based frosting. “The cupcake, which is a symbol of modernity, becomes the threat that we are so concerned about,” he said.
The three panelists all touched on issues of the body in relation to modernity; the absurdity of airport security policy creates a sharp contrast with the brutal reality in Iraq that inspired Bilal’s work. Together, they highlighted the significance of the body as valuable tool for artistic expression.

Ron Rash’s new novel is set in the most American of settings: Appalachia. It employs the rustic prose register of the peculiarly American tradition of the Bible Belt. This North-Carolina, World-War-I period piece of doomed love is, at its core, an attempt to write a Thomas Hardy novel with an added layer of war drama. Mordant descriptions of the rural landscape, characters whose grim lives are briefly lit up by the arrival of enigmatic strangers, and the persistence and futility of hope—these are the hallmarks of Hardy’s great novels, and these compelling aspects are all present in “The Cove.” Yet while Hardy’s deterministic tragedies are genuinely moving, “The Cove,” despite some fine moments, is let down by its plodding narrative, unconvincing characters, and inconsistent writing. It ultimately descends into melodrama and clumsy political allegory.
Laurel Shelton, the novel’s female protagonist and the inhabitant of the eponymous cove, is a character with an obvious precedent—Eustacia Vye, the heroine of Hardy’s “The Return of the Native.” Like Eustacia, Laurel is a mysterious, dark-haired beauty who lives in a secluded place with a single male relative—her brother Hank, maimed in a French battlefield—and is suspected by the petty, gossiping residents of the neighboring town to be a witch. It is early 1918, and Laurel is “waiting for her life to begin.” The cove that she and her brother Hank inhabit is widely regarded as cursed, and she herself is scarred by an ugly birthmark that whispering voices in the town characterize as a sign of the devil. She is orphaned and ostracized, and the arrival of a stranger—just like “Native”—seemingly emancipates Laurel from this bored loneliness.
Laurel’s stranger is Walter—allegedly a New Yorker, struck mute by a childhood disease, and the masterful player of a beautiful silver flute. She meets him by saving his life after he is stung by wasps. Only days later, they are in love, but without due process: their romance does not develop; it merely happens. A romance involving a character incapable of speech ought to be fertile ground, but in Rash’s hands it is weak and unconvincing—and, most surprisingly, characterized by pages of cringe-inducing dialogue. An especially mawkish example is Laurel’s injunction that Walter should not bring his flute with him when they move to New York, for they shall already have “enough prettiness” in their lives.
After a few days of unmitigated happiness, Laurel learns a secret that ought to transform her understanding of Walter’s character. This secret is clearly intended to be a momentous plot twist, but its impact is simultaneously crippled both by the fact that, far from being a twist, it is entirely predictable, and by Laurel’s reaction to her realization. Walter’s unmasking reveals that he has propagated a massive deceit on Laurel. Yet she is blissfully unconcerned, and their romance continues. This absurd set of events insults the intelligence of the reader. Laurel’s stunned realization of a fact painfully obvious from chapters before devalues any claim she might have had to be a compelling and credible character.
The counterpoint to Laurel’s and Walter’s romance is the activity of Chauncey Feith, an unscrupulous, cowardly, and ambitious young man who conceals his own unwillingness to enlist in World War I by serving as a zealous Army recruiter. Feith is a pantomime villain, entirely without remorse or kindness. In a meandering set of passages, he persecutes a local professor simply for speaking German. Despite the inordinate number of pages dedicated to him, Feith is less character than plot device. He plays a crucial role in the novel’s denouement, and also serves to illustrate Rash’s evident concerns with the 21st century politics of warmongering and the war on terror. “We are arresting them all,” Feith declares at one point. “What’s the truth and what ain’t we can sort out later.” His cavalier attitude to justice mimics modern rhetoric used to justify, for instance, the prison camp on Guantanamo Bay.
Rash was a poet before he was a novelist, and at its best, his prose resonates with the lyrical tone of Appalachia. A particularly fine example is his description of Feith’s worries: “The coming day’s responsibilities were like cockleburs prickling away sleep.” At other times, however, the prose overreaches, particularly in Rash’s peculiar fondness for using nouns as verbs. Thus the priest who officiates Laurel’s mother’s funeral is said to have “bibled her mother’s funeral,”and Laurel argues that teaching Walter how to read and write “might confidence him more.” The dialogue’s approximation of early 20th century Appalachian speech is also wildly uneven; it reaches a particular low when Laurel declares her love by telling Walter: “I have feelings for you, heart feelings,” phrasing that appears both clumsy and anachronistic.
The novel’s fatal weaknesses are in its plot and narrative construction. Rash spends chapter after chapter sketching the geographical setting, and in particular the dark atmosphere of the cove, as well as a series of flashbacks to Laurel’s days with her favorite schoolteacher. These vignettes are not merely irrelevant; they are also soporific. This abundance of irrelevant detail, however beautifully written, stands in marked contrast to the breezy manner in which Rash narrates the key events, such as Laurel and Walter’s romance or the horrific tragedy that ends the book. His tendency to spend much more time on matters of minor narrative relevance than those that have the potential to grip the reader renders the tragedy more farcical than moving. Feith’s final crime, which is devoid of context and utterly without explanation, is ultimately a joke, rather than a powerful tragic ending. The contrast with Hardy, whom Rash seeks to emulate in terms of setting, theme, and mood, is unflattering. “The Cove” is a deeply felt tribute to its North Carolina setting, but fails both as a romance and as a World War I thriller.

From the outset, “Bully” is upfront with its audience that the film is going to be far from a pleasant viewing experience. Its opening credits are set to Scala’s cover of “Teenage Dirtbag,” a relatively unsubtle choice of non-diegetic music that encapsulates the film’s central thesis: adolescents can be real shitheads. From there, director Lee Hirsch proceeds to provide numerous, effective case studies that support this point. Yet “Bully” feels like it addresses only half of the equation. For all of the documentary’s efficacy in demonstrating how horrible the bullying problem in the United States is, Hirsch does little to further the conversation aside from essentially arguing the obvious point that, hey everybody, bullying is a bad thing.
The center of “Bully” is Alex Libby, a 12 year old experiencing the worst that middle school has to offer. At the bus stop, another child, unprovoked, threatens to break his Adam’s apple. On the bus, he is punched, pushed out of his seat, and strangled. One kid threatens Alex, claiming, “I will fucking end you and shove a broomstick up your ass.” When Alex reluctantly describes these events, his father has to explicitly inform Alex that these kids are doing more than simply “messing around.” It’s an important scene, highlighting the confusing grey area that separates child’s play from bullying. Likewise, Alex unknowingly demonstrates bullying’s vicious cycle when he says, “They push me so far that I want to become the bully.”
The film also highlights stronger, more assertive personalities than Alex’s resolve of non-aggression. As a negative demonstration of how children respond to bullying, Hirsch chronicles the ongoing rehabilitative struggles of Ja’Meya Jackson, a girl who—having been pushed too far—brought her mother’s gun with her on the bus, but was disarmed before she could do any real physical harm. “It feels like everyone just turned against me,” she says. Jackson, despite these actions, comes across as a sympathetic character, as someone who made an extremely poor decision based on unbearable pressure from her peers.
There is also Kelby Johnson, a 16 year old from “bible belt Oklahoma” who has become a pariah along with her family ever since she came out as queer. She is undeniably the most optimistic of the children in the film, claiming that “If I leave, they win,” and nonchalantly laughing while describing an incident in which some other teens intentionally hit her head-on with their car. She has an almost impossibly strong resolve and impressive optimism that lends a nice balance to the film’s more depressing moments.
This leads us to the families of Tyler Long and Ty Smalley. Tyler, fed up with being bullied, committed suicide at the age of 17, and in one of the film’s many vignettes, his mother Tina describes how his body was discovered, pointing out the holes in the closet wall where they removed the shelf that Tyler hung himself from. Smalley’s story is equally tragic, having taken his own life at just 11 years old. As his father Kirk Smalley remarks at an anti-bullying rally, “I will fight bullying forever, because my son will be 11 years old forever.”
However, while Hirsch effectively portrays the immediate aftermath of a suicide with footage of Smalley’s funeral as well as a school board meeting to discuss bullying five weeks after Long’s death, one gets the sense that he could have gotten such footage only by having pounced on these stories immediately after hearing about them in the news. It creates a slightly gross feel of exploitation, undermining some genuinely distressing shots, such as one of an 11-year-old boy crying over his best friend’s open casket.
The culpability of the school system also lends itself to some particularly anger-inducing sequences. In one instance, an assistant principal, Kim Lockwood, asks a victim to shake hands with his bully as a method of reconciliation and then criticizes the victim for not really meaning his handshake. In another scene, Alex Libby’s parents go to talk to Lockwood about how unsafe the bus ride is, to a misdirected response--talking about her own grandchild--and empty promises. Claiming to have ridden that particular bus route, she asserts that, “Those kids are as good as gold.” Both scenes are outrageous, offensive instances of victim-blaming that demonstrate how bullies put on a nice facade when administrators are present.
The issue with “Bully” is that for all of its power in presenting the horrid tactics that bullies use and their victims’ suffering, it does little to present any options of how to resolve the problem. Hirsch seems so preoccupied in depicting the problems that he does little to outline any solutions. Both Tyler Long’s and Ty Smalley’s parents have set up initiatives to reduce bullying, but Hirsch glosses over these until the very end. It is understandable that Hirsch wants to make clear that current efforts against bullying are not enough, but in shooting for some sort of Brechtian lack of catharsis, “Bully” ends up feeling lazy when it comes to a real discussion of how to put an end to bullying other than through greater awareness.
The recent controversy surrounding “Bully” and its initial ‘R’ rating by the MPAA has centered on the film’s ability to start a conversation. How are children supposed to discuss and eradicate bullying when they aren’t even allowed to see their own peers in action? In this sense, “Bully” is a success: it presents how awful bullying is on its victims and those around the victim. But by starting a conversation and then placing the onus on the viewer to do something, “Bully” feels like a shirking of responsibility. It’s almost as if the film is simply saying, “Bullying is awful, now you deal with the rest.”

When Scott Schultz was five years old, his great-grandfather claimed he had bought Scott a horse and was raising it in the basement. For a year, Schultz said, every visit was the same: little Scotty would beg to see his horse, and his great-grandfather would promise to show it to him next time—the horse was too small and needed rest. Finally, at a New Year’s party, Schultz’s great-grandfather could keep up the ruse no longer. The horse, he explained, was gone—sold to march at the front of the Orange Bowl Parade! Schultz was devastated. “At that point, I was on the dark side of a sugar high, and it was time to go home,” he said.
As Schultz finished his story, over 440 people sat rapt with attention in Brookline’s Coolidge Corner Theater. Schultz was a contestant at the BigMouthOff, the final round in a season of competitive story slams organized by massmouth, a nonprofit group dedicated to promoting storytelling throughout Massachusetts. Each of the 15 contestants had several minutes to relate an experience from life, and the stories they told ranged from comical to confessional. According to these contestants, live storytelling thrives on the direct connection it forges between the storyteller and the audience.
massmouth’s mission is to revive storytelling in the modern world. “Stories promote a healthy, strong, and connected community,” massmouth co-founder Andrea Lovett said during the event. The BigMouthOff contestants had won previous massmouth slams, which were held across the Greater Boston area this season, or had been chosen to advance by audience members. As at the previous slams this season, BigMouthOff contestants were evaluated on the structural efficacy of their stories, the expressiveness of their performances, and the relevance of their stories to one of a series of themes. Each theme—“cupid” or “gifts,” for example—had been the central theme of a previous slam this season.
According to Schultz, the storytelling community encourages more direct audience engagement than comes with simply reading a story. “I thought it would be just fun to write a story and read it,” he said of the beginning of his storytelling career. Schultz brought his story to the Story Space, a storytelling room held at the Out of the Blue Gallery near Central Square. “I started reading the story, and they’re like, ‘Dude, this is a storytelling room. Put down the paper!’ So I’m like, ‘All right,’ and I just started telling the story.” After he told his story, Schultz was approached by Ben Cunningham, last year’s BigMouthOff champion, and encouraged to compete in a massmouth slam at Doyle’s Cafe in Jamaica Plain, which Schultz ended up winning.
Jannelle Codianni, who came in second place in the finals on Wednesday night, told the story of her unlikely marriage, which blossomed out of a mainly physical relationship with a man to whom she expected not to get attached—since she at the time was only interested in women. Codianni first decided to tell this story as a surprise Valentine’s Day gift for her husband, she said. Without telling him where they were going, she took him to the cupid-themed slam, got up, and told the story of how they fell in love.
For Codianni, there’s a transformative moment that occurs when an audience identifies with a story and its teller. “My goal was always to take a small thing that had happened to me and try to, like, blow it up so that other people would be able to see themselves in that story on some level,” she said. “And I think that [it] changes the world...when we see ourselves in other people. I think that [it] really does [make an] actual difference.”
Several of the presenters also emphasized the therapeutic nature of telling deeply personal stories. Regi Carpenter, who won first prize at the BigMouthOff, gave a wrenching account of the nervous breakdown she suffered as a teenager. Touching on different events of her childhood and adolescence, Carpenter presented a harrowing story of domestic violence and psychological shock. “It’s probably the big untold story of my life…. I had been working on it and working on it, and I just thought, ‘I’m just going to do it. It’s time to do it,’” Carpenter said. “Untold stories have way too much power. Once you tell them…then [they don’t] have power over you. You get to craft them and shape them and work them as art.... Art has always saved me.”
For massmouth participants, said BigMouthOff finalist Abhishek Shah, listening to each other’s stories means more than competition. It also has the dual benefit of helping the storytellers hone their craft and linking them on an emotional level. “Just by observing other people as well and listening to their stories, it makes me stay connected, and it makes me stay motivated,” Shah said.

Jason Mraz has fallen in love. Or so he claims on his new album, “Love is a Four Letter Word,” in which the theme of love is runs through all 12 tracks. Recording a whole album with one unifying theme is a new concept for the singer-songwriter, whose albums are usually broad in their subject matter. In past releases, Mraz has blended diverse genres with a lyrical style that is frequently tongue-in-cheek, sometimes piercingly honest, and always loaded with personality. But in trying to write a concept album, Mraz unfortunately settles for uninteresting cliché, resulting in a collection of love songs with no heart.
The most disappointing part of “Love” is that Mraz seems to have lost his desire to experiment, sonically or conceptually. On 2005’s “Mr. A-Z,” he dabbled in opera, psychedelic rock, and rap, and wrote songs about airplanes and the moon. Even when Mraz missed the mark, it was refreshing to hear a singer-songwriter exploring in a genre that too often gets caught up in treacly affectations and innocuous platitudes. With “Love,” however, he has abandoned his sense of adventure.
Previously, Mraz’s words and affect were sometimes so silly they bordered on the ridiculous. However, he allowed his lyrics to go down easily by throwing in a healthy spoonful of self-awareness—even his biggest eye-rollers, like “Geek in the Pink,” were accompanied with an obvious enough wink that the listener knew he was having fun in spite of himself. On “Love,” Mraz scarcely bats an eyelash as he tosses out lines like, “With my hand behind you, I will catch you if you fall / I’m just gonna love you like the woman I love.” The groaners on the album—and they are everywhere—are accompanied by none of the irony that made his previous indulgences tolerable.
It also does Mraz no favors that he says absolutely nothing unique about love. The target of his affections is bland and faceless. We are told on “I Won’t Give Up” that looking into his lover’s eyes is like “Watching the night sky / Or a beautiful sunrise,” and on “The Woman I Love,” he alludes to her maybe having some problems. But this is the extent of the complexity he gives to her: the songs on the album could be written about any girl.
Though normally this would simply broaden the songs’ appeal, given Mraz’s new stylistic sterilization it feels more like a cheap marketing ploy. His songwriting, which used to be on the whole frank and straightforward, now feels pedestrian, underwhelming, and contrived. “Ticket lines and places to dine / Taking baths and drinking wine,” he sings on “In Your Hands.” Or, alternatively, on “Living in the Moment,” he sings with a grinning earnestness that is so forced that it almost feels ironic: “I’m living in the moment / Living my life / Easy and breezy / With peace in my mind.”
However, the album is not a complete wash. For one, Mraz’s voice, his best asset, is in top form. On “Frank D. Fixer,” for instance, his voice goes from mellow and soothing to exciting and energetic as he belts out pitch-perfect notes and glissandos that span his register.
And “5/6,” the album’s best track, sees Mraz playing with a compound time signature with satisfying results. His most compelling lines also appear in this song: “Don’t dress up your children like dolls from your past / or they’ll run from you madly, they’ll never look back.” The old Jason Mraz,  with his thoughtful songwriting and proclivity for musical experimentation, is in here somewhere.
However, these moderate successes only highlight the glaring failures of the album. There is no shortage of interesting ways to write music about well trodden topics, but Mraz appears largely uninterested in exploring any of them. Despite its subject matter, “Love is a Four Letter Word” is surprisingly hard to love.

“Oh, wow. There are a lot of people here.”
On a stage covered in white Christmas lights, Nanna Hilmarsdóttir, female vocalist and one sixth of Of Monsters and Men, seemed genuinely surprised at the turnout. The band’s show at the Boston House of Blues had been moved there from the Brighton Music Hall, which had sold out. The group sold out the House of Blues as well.
Her surprise is warranted. A year ago, the Icelandic band was scarcely known outside of its home country; now the group is selling out venues all over the United States and Canada. Expectations ran high for the group’s first North American tour: its challenge was to wrest the explosive energy of their debut album “My Head Is an Animal” into an exciting live show. On Saturday, Apr. 7, OMAM left nothing to be desired. Its live show was a resounding affirmation of the promises of their charming and powerful debut album.
The group’s sound is at once familiar and refreshing. Most tracks start off with simple guitar strumming and hushed vocals before swelling and blossoming into catchy, exhilarating sing-alongs, complete with whole-band “la-la-la” choruses and shouts of “Hey!” that sound more like animalistic barks than indie-rock placeholders. The band’s unique brand of folk has drawn deserved comparisons to Arcade Fire, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Mumford & Sons. The band’s fantastical, often melancholy lyrics and foot-stomping arrangements have catapulted it to worldwide success in a very short amount of time.
The group found domestic success in 2010 by winning Músíktilraunir, an Icelandic music competition. It first started turning foreign heads in August 2011, when American radio stations began playing its debut single, the horn-driven romp “Little Talks.” As the group gained momentum abroad, things began to move fast; OMAM were signed to Universal and released an EP in December 2011. On Apr. 3 of this year, they released their full-length LP, “My Head Is an Animal,” in the United States. Since then, it has sold over 55,000 copies, reaching number 6 on the Billboard 200.
It was in the middle of this dizzying ride that OMAM walked onto the stage to a full house at the House of Blues. The band set up linearly across the stage, so that it was possible to see what every band member was doing all the time. During the few slow songs that involved only one or two people, the rest of the band looked unsure of what to do with themselves. But the setup’s purpose was clear during the louder songs, which made up the bulk of the set list. OMAM’s sizeable six-person roster—plus a seventh touring keyboardist/trumpeter—filled up the front of the stage. On songs like “King and Lionheart” and the unreleased closer “Beneath my Bed,” the entire ensemble was rocking out, and the group’s energy was more than infectious. The band had the entire audience cheering, jumping, and clapping along.
When the band started playing “Little Talks,” the audience went wild, matching each “Hey!” from the band and dancing energetically. This song seemed to be the main draw for most of the audience, and for good reason—the rest of the songs they performed had been released only four days before the concert. Those songs were still being digested; “Little Talks,” with its double-time kick drum and elegant male-female vocal exchange, felt like a classic in comparison.
OMAM’s success has been driven not only by its energy but also by its thoughtfullness and emotional depth. This depth manifested itself in the delicate exchanges between Hilmarsdóttir and male vocalist Ragnar Þórhallson. In several songs, like “Little Talks,” Hilmarsdóttir voiced anxieties and  Þórhallson relieved them. In most, Þórhallson’s forceful tenor simply provided a textural counterpoint to Hilmarsdóttir’s atmospheric croon.
Throughout the concert, OMAM never once seemed disconnected from the people responsible for its success. Hilmarsdóttir said “Thank you so much!” after what seemed like every song. During “Sloom,” drummer Arnar Hilmarsson left his perch behind the kit and got the audience clapping along. And before “Lakehouse,” guitarist Brynjar Leifsson threw a custom-knit monster hand into the crowd—with the stipulation that whoever caught it had to give it to the person next to them.
“We are far from home / But we’re so happy,” Of Monsters and Men sang on second number “From Finner.” The band members were indeed quite far from home, but they never once seemed out of their element—and their happiness was contagious.

Matthew A. Aucoin ’12 wrote his first opera before he was a teenager. The 2012 recipient of the Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts, an award given by the advisory board of the Office for the Arts at Harvard to the senior who demonstrates the most overall “artistic talent and achievement,” Aucoin has since had his operas staged at Harvard and in New York. On Friday, he will see the premiere of his newest opera—“Hart Crane,” about the poet of the same name—for which he wrote both the score and the libretto.
Aucoin, an English concentrator in Kirkland House, writes poetry and conducts in addition to composing. He is the music director of the Dunster House Opera and assistant conductor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra. His poetry has been published in the campus literary magazines the Harvard Advocate and the Gamut.
The Harvard Crimson: What drew you to opera?
Matthew A. Aucoin: I caught the “opera bug” almost so long ago that I can’t remember—I was about seven or eight. I had already been playing piano, and I was already writing stories for fun, so it seemed like the most natural fusion of the two arts that I already loved. I think that, from the start, the possibilities of opera seemed limitless; it seemed like it was a broader canvas, a fuller canvas, to create a world on than any other form of art that I could think of.
THC: What about Hart Crane struck you as good material for an opera?
MAA: Pretty much everything.… I find him incredibly compelling as a figure. He was an openly gay poet in the 1920s who fled from his home in Ohio at about 16 to create this life for himself. He committed suicide at 32, and the saddest thing is that we don’t have all the great poems he would have written. Most poets are not anywhere near mature by the time they’re 32. He certainly wasn’t, so he’s a great example of lost potential. I met with a great literary critic who’s a big fan of Crane, and when I told him I was writing an opera about him, he said, “My dear boy, Crane is already an opera—you don’t need to do that.”
THC: Do you find Crane’s work especially musical?
MAA: In a way, all poetry treats language as riding a musical line—not as pure music, but following music…. But for Crane, the music comes first.… The way that he constructs images is to evoke the experience of seeing [an image] rather than the image itself. So instead of saying that there are masts in Brooklyn Harbor, he says something like “gongs in white surplices,” which is a really hard image to see until you imagine that the sail is seen through a haze, which is like a gong sound expanding towards you.… After a while, it makes a certain kind of sense.
THC: What inspired you to branch out from playing music to composing and conducting?
MAA: Actually, it was the other way around. I composed first. I originally wanted to learn piano just so I could compose on something. I always played piano pretty seriously.… After a few lucky encounters with some really great mentors, it seemed like conducting was a natural way to bring together all the things that I already loved to do.
THC: Has your experience in each art form enhanced your work with the others?
MAA: I find that the alternation between contemplative activity and the physical activity of performing is a self-energizing alternation. I find that I do both things better in a given day if I balance the time that I spend between them. Last summer, when I was at the Spoleto Festival in Italy, I would have every morning to explore the Umbrian countryside and just write, think, and compose for five hours every day. And by about lunchtime, I was ready for a break, and that break ended up being conducting and coaching. It uses a totally different region of the brain to do the same activity, which is making music.
THC: In both poetry and music, do you write for yourself, or do you write for others?
MAA: I think I write because it’s a physical need, first of all. When you begin a poem or a piece, you begin it because you feel like something really wants to be born, and you realize that you’re never going to understand what that thing is until it’s made physical. And as for things that I write about, recently…my poems often deal with music, explicitly or implicitly. I think I want to explore in language what the experience of music is.
THC: So for you, music and poetry are very intertwined?
MAA: Yeah—I think that the experience of writing a poem is a musical experience, and I think that learning a score has a lot to do with reading a poem really deeply.

“I thought it was going to last. I thought that we had changed the world forever and that people were going to suddenly start trusting each other and that we were all going to be one,” Peter R. Simon said of his experience of the ’60s and ’70s. “And I think why I got so depressed at 9/11 was because it all went up in smoke and ashes.”
Simon, a photographer, has spent time living on a hippie commune and documented concerts by musicians including Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead. The Occupy movement has somewhat renewed his hope for this generation, he said in an interview at Boston’s Yes.Oui.Si. art exhibition space. “Feeling like there was a real trust and a bond amongst total strangers—that feeling did come back a little bit with Occupy. Not as much, but I did get that feeling again,” Simon said. Photographs of the Occupy movement—the subject of Simon’s most recent work—and of ’60s protests and free love share the Yes.Oui.Si. gallery with sculptures and jewelry created by Simon’s wife, Ronni S. Simon. The joint exhibit runs until April 28.
Occupy’s tent cities are a far cry from Martha’s Vineyard, where Peter and Ronni live and run their gallery, the Simon Gallery. “Our lives have never taken a linear path. I’ve never had a nine-to-five job, and Peter hasn’t either,” Ronni said in an interview at Yes.Oui.Si. A former potter who sold her creations on the streets of Greenwich Village, Ronni decided to apply the crocheting skills that she learned as a young child from her mother to another art form: jewelry. “Because I’m self-taught, I crochet my jewelry,” she said, herself wearing some of her own pearl and silver wir pieces.
The gallery also features her sculptures, more recent artistic endeavors. While with jewelry she has to consider how a piece will fit on a buyer’s wrist or how an earring will dangle, Ronni explained that with her sculpture she has freedom to create art unbounded by logistical constraints. “It is liberating as an artist to just deal with form and not function,” she said.
Peter was a curious seven-year-old when his father first taught him how to develop and print film. “When he died, it was very clear that I was the one to carry on the legacy of his darkroom equipment and cameras,” Peter said. A photojournalism major at Boston University in the ’60s, Peter was drawn toward hippie culture and then rock and roll. He began working with publications such as the Atlantic Monthly and Rolling Stone. The gallery includes many photos from those years: the Grateful Dead jamming at San Francisco’s Kezar Stadium; Bob Dylan onstage at a piano in front of masses of long-haired, attentive believers; and Led Zeppelin on a hotel balcony along Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. Peter said became more interested in reggae in the mid-1970s, and on one wall of the gallery hangs a 1976 photograph of Bob Marley leaning against a car with a joint in his hand.
However, once Peter and Ronni had a child, Peter had to focus on more practical and commercial photography in order to support a family, he said. Though he laid aside his alternative lifestyle photography to settle down in Martha’s Vineyard, he recently got swept up in the Occupy movement. “The only thing that has turned me on in terms of photo documentation the way it did in the ’60s and ’70s has been the Occupy movement,” he said.
One wall of the gallery is devoted to black-and-white photos of hippie communes, a bright picture of a 1968 tent city, and a 1968 photograph of men and women marching through water with hands raised in peace signs. On another wall hang photographs of a different tent city and a man holding up his fingers in a peace sign, but these photographs are in color and are labeled “NYC 2011.” In his captions, Peter references the parallel he sees between the Occupy movement and his experience of the anti-war movement and ’60s culture: a photograph of a man holding “Mean People Suck” stickers is entitled “One Love,” and another reads “Give Peace Another Chance.”
Yes.Oui.Si., founded in February of 2011 as a “multi-sensory exhibition space” for young artists, features visual arts as well as music performances. However, founding partner and Director Miguel S. de Braganza sees the Simons’ work as an unusual addition to the gallery. “We show emerging artists from the area,” de Braganza said. “This show is a different direction for us.”
In such a setting, Peter’s statement about the present generation caring about the future rings true. “There’s been apathy for 30 years or so, but now [social consciousness] is coming back with Occupy,” he said. “I think things are going to change.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Film critic David D’Arcy is incredulous. “Are you trying…I’m not sure you’re doing this, but do you want me to try to identify something that’s actually earnest in one of Whit’s films?” a bewildered D’Arcy asks me. Critic Anthony Lane of The New Yorker takes a similar stance toward “Damsels in Distress,” the latest movie from filmmaker John Whitney (Whit) Stillman ’73. “Even the distress of the title could, and probably should, be taken as a straight-faced joke,” Lane wrote in a review. In Stillman’s world, Lane claims, “Beauty is not truth, nor truth beauty; both are cradled in quotation marks.” Lane and D’Arcy could have broken a sweat straining to keep their eyebrows raised through all 97 minutes of “Damsels.”
But their distant, ironized reading of Stillman’s works has more serious consequences. Understood properly, Stillman’s four movies—beginning with “Metropolitan” in 1990, then “Barcelona” in 1994, “The Last Days of Disco” in 1998, and finally “Damsels,” which opens in Boston this Friday—make a claim for the utopian value of social communities. The group of young friends at the center of each movie is painfully self-conscious about a critical dilemma: How does one grow into a successful adult without becoming impossibly boring or unhappy? These groups of self-styled UHBs (“Upper Haute Bourgeoisie,” characteristic Stillman-speak from “Metropolitan”) can make fools of themselves in their attempts to mature. However, a cult following has developed around Stillman’s films based on his young characters’ serious attitudes about growing up together.
“It was impossible not to know who Whit Stillman was at the time his films were released,” says director of the Harvard Film Archive Haden Guest. “They were so rapturously received; they were such touchstone films for American independent films of the late 20th century. They brought a new energy and sophistication into screen comedy.” Stillman is the clear artistic predecessor for contemporary giants like Noah Baumbach and Wes Anderson. Getting to the truth of his movies is necessary, then, to understanding some of the best contemporary films. But, more importantly, truly understanding his work has the potential to save Stillman from an ill-fitting critical mischaracterization.
PASSING THE ACID TEST
Stillman has floppy gray hair and a quick walk that belies his 60 years. But the bounce in his step should be no surprise: Stillman is a man on the move, publicizing his first new movie in 14 years as his artistic legacy remains in flux. On a publicity tour for “Damsels,” Stillman spent a weekend in February talking about his major films at the HFA. Clad in baggy green corduroys and a Ralph Lauren tweed jacket, he also stopped by for an interview at The Crimson, where he was an editor as an undergraduate. Stillman talked about his time at Harvard, his memories from visiting New York when he was young, his late start at directing movies, and the meaning of his work.
Stillman arrived at Harvard as a freshman in 1969 at the height of student political radicalism. He recalls attending some of the monthly demonstrations. At one of the more violent mobilizations, he watched students burn the Out of Town News in the center of Harvard Square and trash J. Press. Stillman’s dissatisfaction with this kind of political activism extended to the Harvard social scene. “The time I was here was a grim time, ’69 to ’73. It was really kind of bleak,” he said at the HFA. “There was no social life, no dancing.”
Fred Boynton (played by archetypal Stillman actor Chris Eigeman) in “Barcelona” provides a counterintuitive reading of “The Graduate” that seems emblematic of Stillman’s attitude toward the ’60s: “Katharine Ross has just married this cool, tall, blond, popular guy, the make-out king of his fraternity, and this obnoxious Dustin Hoffman character shows up at the church, starts pounding on the glass, acting like a total asshole.” This famous scene in the canonical ’60s film is typically understood to show Hoffman, a reflective, searching hero, stealing the girl from his bland and conservative rival. The comic value of Fred’s attitude is that there is some truth to the opposite interpretation that Ross’ fiancé is a desirable guy and that Hoffman’s character is being incredibly selfish. The dramatic attempts at moral or spiritual transcendence typical of a certain ’60s attitude transform under Stillman’s lens.
Stillman took time off from school to learn Spanish in Mexico, and when he came back he took a job at Tommy’s Value—then a lunch counter—and joined the Fly Club. He said he found his voice on The Crimson only briefly, through columns written by a fictional outsider named “Alexis de Tokeville” who examined Harvard culture. By junior year, Stillman says, he had shaken off his depression and found himself at home at the College.
That was due in part to Stillman’s discovery of his academic sensibility. “A huge influence was professor Walter Jackson Bate and his course The Age of [Samuel] Johnson,” Stillman says. “We read The Spectator paper, Joseph Addison, his character Sir Roger de Coverley, and it led to a lifelong interest in that sort of literature.” Stillman translated this highly mannered 18th century literary style into the hyper-rational conversations of his fictional characters.
But his inspiration for the way his characters speak also comes from his experience growing up. Though Stillman is not from New York City, he often spent time there in high school and college. He remembers going to dances at Chapin, one of New York’s elite private schools, and asking girls what they thought about Harry Truman in order to strike up conversation. “I really dined out on that,” Stillman recalls in our interview. The deb ball social scene from “Metropolitan” comes from Stillman’s own experience meeting graduate students from Columbia University at deb parties. “They were sort of effete, decadent, literary grad student types who gravitated to that social milieu and really made it charming…. [The parties] attracted lots of odd birds and rare birds.”
Stillman did not begin work on “Metropolitan” until he was in his 30s. Between graduation and his first film, Stillman says he identified to some extent with one of his most depressing and funny characters, the almost young, almost middle-aged man in the restaurant J.G. Melon in “Metropolitan.” When asked whether his entire preppy class is “doomed to failure,” the man replies, “Doomed? That would be far easier. No, simply failure without being doomed.” He calls the “acid test” of success or failure “whether you take any pleasure in responding to the question, ‘What do you do?’” The man’s reaction to the test: “I can’t bear it.”
But Stillman did eventually find a satisfying answer to that acid test in filmmaking. After Stillman struggled to raise money for “Metropolitan,” in which his mother made a substantial investment, the movie grossed almost 10 times its budget. Stillman also received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. That film and “The Last Days of Disco” have both gained entry into the Criterion Collection as Stillman has found his films supported by a small international following.  D’Arcy, a fan of Stillman’s work, compares his fanbase to that of an Apple product or type of wine; it’s something, he says, “that wasn’t rooted in any particular geographic place but was rooted in a sensibility.” Though Stillman’s commercial success has been moderate, his impact on a certain subculture has been tremendous.
DISCO UTOPIA
Stillman’s films have a beautifully manicured comic exterior, but what has made them so important is their sensitive treatment of social connection. “The utopian aspect of these films is the idea of these communities,” Stillman says in our interview. “I felt that there wasn’t enough fabric and texture in American society, institutions that bring people together. A lot of people like to be critical of institutions that bring people together…. I am in favor of institutions that bring people together.” “Utopia” is a big word, and its strangeness to real life and inaccessibility to Stillman’s characters is enacted by the comedy of his films. But the real possibility of utopia also makes Stillman’s movies matter.
Part of the comedy of this utopia comes in the way that Stillman’s films create a fictional space for civility that, from reality’s point of view, looks comedic. In the first scene of “Metropolitan,” a few college students on their way out of a New York debutante ball get in a discussion about who has claim over a taxi. “No, we’ll share it, I insist,” says Eigeman’s character Nick Smith. “That way there will be no ill feeling.” This consideration for a stranger over a taxi ride is preposterously far from the reality of New York cab-hailing practices. Smith and his friends, without second thought, then invite the stranger—Tom Townshend—to an after party with them.
The first shot of the party is a discussion between a beautiful girl and the bespectacled Charlie Black (played by Taylor Nichols, the only major actor to appear in every Stillman movie) about a proof of God. “What it shows is a kind of belief is innate in all of us,” says an academic and tuxedoed Black about his proof. The girls at the party have heard of Townshend as a political radical who looks down on things like deb balls, and they ask him what exactly his beliefs are. “I’m a committed socialist, but I’m not a Marxist,” he says. “I favor the socialist model developed by the 19th century French social critic Charles Fourier.”
Stillman has effectively recast the Enlightenment salon among adolescent deb ball preps. Like with any other salon, there is some belief shared among all the participants that rational debate can lead to some greater truth—that each individual at the party is committed to a common task of mutual learning. This idea lends the scene its comic self-seriousness. References like Fourier then seem utterly pretentious. But what is important about the scene is actually that pretense is completely absent—the kids are on a sincere quest to become the kind of adults they could respect. They want to understand their own position in the world.
"The Last Days of Disco,” which features many of the same actors, could concern the same exact group of people eight years later. A circle of friends forms around the once-famous New York nightclub Studio 54. In one scene, the characters all compare their intellectual readings of “Lady and the Tramp.” There is the same disconnect between their believable setting and their unbelievable behavior within that setting. “The idea of a disco where people go to have intellectual conversations—that’s a utopia, that doesn’t exist,” Guest says. Stillman’s films make us laugh at these idealistic depictions of human behavior, but they also make us wonder what life would be like if our friends really were this sincere. Or, even, if everyone were.
Ultimately, Stillman’s characters are denied the utopia they wanted in the beginning of each film in favor of a different image of social harmony. In “Metropolitan,” the clique that Townshend stumbled into—The Sally Fowler Rat Pack—dissolves, but a desperate sequence alone with Charlie leads to his reunion with Audrey, the girl whose love he has mistakenly spurned. In “The Last Days of Disco,” the disco age ends and the main characters, in the final scene, all walk their separate ways. “To me, these communities are tinged with a twilight quality,” says Guest. The film’s end credits, however, qualify as Stillman’s most obvious expression of utopia: all ethnicities and classes of pedestrian on a subway train and platform spontaneously break into dance to The O’Jays’ “Love Train.” “This is Whit Stillman’s fascination with and love of disco,” Guest says. “It’s a shared and ardently sincere ritual. It can liberate people, bring people together, it can forge or create a community, however fleeting it might be.”
 “DAMSEL” DREAM
The fantasy that ended “The Last Days of Disco” opened a new path to Stillman, who says he has been working on “transcending naturalism” ever since. In the rough cut Stillman showed of “Damsels” at the HFA, friends go on a search for the lost protagonist using lacrosse sticks as if they were metal detectors on the beach; a frat boy struggles to name basic colors; and tap dance is used at the campus Suicide Prevention Center as a serious possible remedy for suicidal depression. For D’Arcy and Lane, this fantasy and the seemingly serious conversation surrounding it typifies Stillman’s pervasive irony.
Actress Greta Gerwig’s Violet, the outsized personality whose type was given to the characters played by Chris Eigeman in the past Stillman films and Kate Beckinsale in “The Last Days of Disco,” has a refreshingly perverse attitude toward all sorts of things. “I love clichés and hackneyed expressions of every kind,” she declares at one point; “I’d like to thank you for this chastisement,” she comments after being justly insulted; and, after a breakdown that follows being dumped by her boyfriend, she finds the answer to her crisis in a bar of hotel soap: “The scent and the soap is what gives me hope.”
"I tend to think that a lot of these conversations that seem a lot more refined than the frat boys’ are just as pointless and just as absurd as what the frat boys do,” says D’Arcy. “It amounts to just as little.” The absurdity that connects Violet’s and the frat boys’ behavior, then, serves as a clue: the reflective, intellectual mode of understanding the world is just as pointless as the most dumb and thoughtless orientation. With this view into Stillman’s world, we are incapable of finding any deeper meaning or richer truth. “The films are all about futility, about finding out that things are not as good as you thought they might be,” says D’Arcy. “Think of a very polished and gentle New Yorker cartoon that’s wrapped around cynicism...that’s wrapped around a very gentlemanly skepticism about anything.”
That means that though Stillman’s characters are on a quest to find integrity and joy, they are inevitably destined for the mediocrity prescribed by the depressed metropolitan in J.G. Melon. The viewer, then, sees each character from an alienating distance. In his New Yorker review, Lane writes that the charm of “Damsels” “springs from the principle that characters’ feelings exist not so much to be indulged as to be guyed and sported with, or swapped like clothes and shoes. The more intense the feeling, the more that principle obtains.” Lane uses Violet’s embrace of tap dance and soap as solutions to depression as paradigmatic examples of this cavalier attitude toward serious issues.
Stillman’s own statements about the utopian aspect of his films cast serious doubt on Lane’s and D’Arcy’s reading. But D’Arcy’s and Lane’s central mistake is that they seem to assume that Stillman’s absurdity reveals some distaste for reality—how, they think, could a bar of soap really mend a broken heart? Stillman’s representation of conviction in soap would then function to reveal the absurdity of any conviction.
In fact, the absurdity of Violet’s discovery of the soap is an idealization, not a mockery, of reality. When she hands the bar to two construction workers in a diner, they sniff it and smile—they understand its potential significance. Violet’s friends also appreciate the scent once she shows the soap to them. In Violet’s joy at finding her soap, “Damsels” shows how seriousness of purpose can be infused with a lightness of being. By that reasoning, the cynicism that Lane detects in Violet’s use of tap as an anti-depressant completely misses the point of the gesture: Even if tap could never actually solve depression, wouldn’t the world be wonderful if it could?
Utopias do not concern a critique of what is; they concern an imagined world outside of reality that constructs new possibilities for human order. “Damsels” is a dream Stillman has been having for 14 years about a world in which being normal and clean and enjoying dance can lead unerringly to fulfillment. The new film—his most absurd—is the clearest expression of Stillman’s utopian impulse.
STILLMAN’S SOAPBOX
“In all three films—it’s true in ‘Damsels’ too—it’s so funny because no one is ever kidding,” says Stillman devotee Amanda W. Hameline ’12. “The humor comes because no one is ever making a joke.” Stillman’s greatest achievement has been this ability to make pure reason so ridiculous and so admirable at once. His small groups of friends discuss Disney movies like they are funerals, but that also means that they really listen to what everyone is saying about everything. They are rarely sarcastic and never indifferent. A Stillman-styled utopia is not realizable in its full form on earth—and maybe we should be happy that there are people who don’t love hotel soap, or even who don’t shower every single day. It’s bizarre that someone could see utopia in a bar of soap—and therein lies the value of Stillman’s work.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent TV interview, travel show host Anthony Bourdain shared his tips on finding “local flavors” when traveling abroad, suggesting that “drinking with the locals” is always a good way to start. While it is irrelevant whether Bourdain himself, someone known to travel extensively, is a true “global citizen,” it is interesting that the famous host epitomizes a common view of the values of travel and an understanding of other cultures.
Although being a global citizen implies extensive travel and some familiarity with foreign languages and conspicuous aspects of cultures such as food and drink, the concept should really be defined by one’s ability to engage with and adopt different perspectives meaningfully when viewing the world. This cannot be achieved without a thorough and serious engagement, both academic and otherwise, with foreign languages and cultures in a genuine context. Just as travel alone is not enough, I think that reading the Economist cover to cover every week is likewise neither necessary nor sufficient to make a global citizen. One must truly immerse oneself in a different culture in an intellectual and humble manner in order to gain the knowledge and perspective necessary to alter one’s worldview positively and fundamentally.
To this end, there is a need for Harvard to go beyond its existing measures to create global citizens on campus and to adopt further measures to challenge us in our engagement with other perspectives. For example, even though Harvard offers a broad range of foreign language and culture classes, students often decide which ones to learn about based on reasoning that detracts from the value of engaging with other perspectives. For example, the Chinese department at Harvard sees ever-increasing student interest in elementary Chinese courses because of the perceived usefulness of an understanding of the language and culture as China becomes a dominant economic power in the world. With such a pragmatic attitude in undertaking the intellectual endeavor of studying a foreign language and culture, it is easy for students to lose interest altogether in time or acquire knowledge without gaining new perspectives along the way. Even students with relative proficiency in a foreign language who opt to work abroad often take jobs that allow or encourage them either to ignore the vast majority of people in their new places of residence or to engage with them only in culturally homogenized or purely business-related contexts. As a case in point, I worked for an American businessman in Shanghai in the summer of 2010 who, despite speaking relatively fluent Mandarin, made it abundantly clear to me and other Chinese interns that he had no interest in learning about Chinese history and culture beyond the “cultural” knowledge (such as drinking manners in a business meeting) that is advantageous to him as a businessman in China. He thinks and does business in a way that is characteristically American and humors the Chinese way of thinking around him only to serve the practical needs of his business.
In other words, I think the primary issue in global citizenship is not necessarily one of culture, or even language, but one of perspective. It is about understanding—beyond superficial and rather meaningless “understanding” that the Germans are “serious” and the Japanese “polite”—why different people think and act the way that they do. Having lived, studied, and worked in four countries during my time at Harvard, I think that genuine understanding of a culture and language fluency really present perspectives that are not accessible otherwise. It is a meaningful thing to learn from the strengths and values of the developing world, just as it is important and humbling to understand the differences that make certain developed countries excel in areas where America fails.
As such, Harvard should acknowledge that two semesters of a foreign language or a score of 600 on an SAT Subject Test are insufficient requirements for undergraduates. A language citation or proof of true fluency in a language other than English should be necessary. A semester abroad should also be considered mandatory.  If this happens, the structure of study abroad must shift from one of Harvard or American comradeship to one of self-reliance, intellectual engagement, and true immersion. Perhaps most importantly, I think that Harvard should provide greater support for students wishing to work abroad. In the current system, most students who wish to do meaningful work abroad outside the scope of multinational banks and consulting firms find little support and often have to accept unfulfilling jobs as a “sacrificial” first step in their attempts to become true global citizens.
In her Class Day address in 2010, former CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour urged graduates to go abroad to both learn from other people and cultures and to share their own values with others. She said that only by being “fully informed, fully aware, and fully on board” could we both derive and impart the maximum benefit to and from our home countries and the places we choose to work in and visit. Harvard would do well to heed this advice as it considers what future students need and what the world needs from future graduates.

Next month, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will vote on a proposal to introduce two new engineering concentrations to the curriculum. If approved, electrical and mechanical will join biomedical as the only specialized engineering programs at Harvard.
Some have raised concerns about the effect that two new concentrations, each requiring 20 half courses, will have on students’ freedom to explore different areas of interest. A few faculty members also allege that departments that teach more practical skills, like engineering, should not be expanded. These fears could not be more unfounded—the expansion of SEAS is a positive development that will only complement the diverse options offered by the Program in General Education. Further, the belief that the study of a practical field is anti-intellectual or detrimental to a liberal arts education is fallacious; engineering is as intellectually rigorous a field as any other at Harvard, and deserves expansion.
Students only stand to gain from more options. Academia is not a zero-sum game in which the expansion of a field can only occur at the expense of another. Enabling students to choose from a larger pool of academic options will only enrich the educational experience at Harvard. The Gen Ed program already provides a wealth of academic options and diverse courses that make a liberal arts education special—expanding the engineering department only furthers these goals.
At some institutions, students are compelled to commit to a field of study prior to matriculation. Harvard fortunately has no such requirement. This allows students to dabble in different fields prior to declaring a concentration. While the timetable for this will be understandably constrained for engineering concentrators, students will still retain the ability to explore different fields before choosing a long-term academic path.
It is worth noting that SEAS has been committed to growing the engineering program for a while. We are glad to see SEAS taking concrete steps to actualize its plans to expand Harvard’s engineering program.
While electrical and mechanical engineering may not fit into the conventional conception of a liberal arts program, the notion that such programs are tainted by even the slightest trace of practicality is fundamentally flawed. Practicality is not tantamount to pre-professionalism, a distinction many seem to forget when considering engineering.  The purist paranoia at times exhibited by some faculty does a disservice to liberal education as a whole. Education is continually evolving—Harvard stands to lose by remaining anchored to the past.

Yesterday’s appointment of Dr. Jim Yong Kim as World Bank president marks a remarkable departure from the past. Not only is Dr. Kim the first person of Asian descent to become president of the World Bank (he immigrated to the United States from South Korea at the age of 5) but unlike his predecessors who have been bankers, politicians, or technocrats, Dr. Kim has dedicated his life’s work to international development. He is the first to have in-the-field development experience as a physician and public health expert. As President Obama declared, “It’s time for a development professional to lead the world's largest development agency.” As students dedicated to international development, we could not agree more.
Since its birth in the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference, the World Bank has favored conservative “free-market” policies with detrimental, unintended consequences for the poor. For instance, the countries that accepted structural adjustment loans—loans that were tied to strict neo-liberal reforms—guided by the World Bank were often forced to siphon money away from their health sector to avoid defaulting on their debt, ultimately resulting in further dependency on loans and further accumulation of debt. We applaud President Obama’s nomination and the bank board’s appointment of Dr. Kim as representing an important shift away from the neoliberal orthodoxy of the Washington Consensus.
Dr. Kim’s ideology reflects the World Bank’s broader mission of economic growth, while still recognizing the problematic ramifications of past World Bank policies. What makes Dr. Kim a profound thinker can be found in his seminal work, "Limited Good, Limited Vision." Dr. Kim was the first to fight back against the pervasive notion of “limited good,” which argues that funding more expensive development programs detracts from equally necessary, less-expensive initiatives. Dr. Kim urged the development community to move from “theories of limited good to theories and actions that are based on an understanding of the scale and importance of the problem.” Unlike his predecessors, who focus primarily on the cost-effectiveness of programs, Dr. Kim recognizes the underlying economic and moral imperatives of the World Bank to focus on equalizing efforts that invest in human beings. His vision of inclusive growth promotes long-term prosperity coupled with attempts to build equity and scale up community development successes.
Dr. Kim’s philosophies have been shaped by years of in-the-field experience, another reason that he is such an inspired choice for the World Bank presidency. As co-founder of Partners in Health, which delivers health care in resource poor settings, Dr. Kim has worked directly with the most marginalized populations of Haiti, Peru, Rwanda, Lesotho, and the United States. The geographic breadth of his work, ranging from capital cities to villages, demonstrates precisely the practical exposure to development that the World Bank president ought to wield. In his op-ed, Kim said, “I have confronted the forces that keep more than one billion people trapped in poverty.” He continued, “I want to hear from developing countries, as well as those that provide a big share of the resources to development, about how we can together build a more inclusive, responsive, and open World Bank.” Indeed, Dr. Kim’s practical experience as a physician to the global poor has shaped his vision of inclusivity and openness.
Dr. Kim’s determination to make the World Bank more inclusive reflects his leadership capacity. Despite his humility, Dr. Kim has proven that he is not afraid to challenge the status quo, an attribute that couldn’t be of greater importance in the realm of development economics, where models and orthodoxy often outweigh practical, scalable solutions. Dr. Kim fought against conventional wisdom that argued that PIH’s work was not cost-effective, in fact showing that health is the fundamental pillar to economic growth. When appointed advisor to the director-general of the World Health Organization, and later, director of the WHO’s HIV/AIDS department, Dr. Kim led the “3 by 5” initiative, designed to put 3 million people living with AIDS in developing nations on treatment by 2005.  Launched in 2003, the program reached its goal in 2007, demonstrating that individuals deemed untreatable could actually be treated effectively. Finally, Dr. Kim’s numerous positions within institutions of higher learning demonstrate his capacity for leadership. In 2009, Kim left his post at Harvard to become president of Dartmouth College, where he proved to be an astute leader, particularly in successfully handling the university’s budget crisis.
As members of the Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition, which had the honor of having Dr. Kim as an advisor, we look to Dr. Kim as a visionary. When Dr. Kim co-taught Anthropology 1825: Case Studies in Global Health, he emphasized the importance of evidence-based rationality and intellectual rigor coupled with genuine compassion and inclusivity. We would be shocked if his critical eye does not create a noticeable change in the World Bank. Dr. Kim’s track record has demonstrated his ability to focus on the outcomes of development, rather than becoming trapped in the bureaucratic machinery of the processes behind it. We hope that Dr. Kim will lead and innovate with the fervor that we have always admired, bringing sustainable, equitable development to the communities that the World Bank has always claimed to serve.

Last week marked the tenth anniversary of a bombing at a 2002 Passover dinner in Israel, at which a Hamas suicide bomber murdered 30 Israelis and injured another 160. My grandparents and I had a table reserved at that dinner. If we weren’t ten minutes late, I probably wouldn’t be writing these words. So last week, when Jews all over the world celebrated liberation by tasting bitter herbs, I remembered the bitter taste of my disillusionment growing up in Israel.
Three years prior to the attack, in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv, the seeds of that disillusionment were planted. I was only fourteen, and, for the first time, part of something much greater than myself. The masses surrounding me were dancing in the streets. They were members of a large majority of Israelis who had elected the leftist Labor party that campaigned on peace. Change was right around the corner. We felt so empowered. We were the “peace generation,” and it was especially symbolic that we celebrated in the square that commemorated Rabin, who was assassinated by an extremist Jew for pursuing peace bravely. My forehead was covered with sweat, my T-shirt with election campaign stickers. “The peace camp has won!” the crowd shouted, and I felt like I truly belonged.
The following morning, the “peace generation” left the square and went home. And then the suicide bombings began. The wave of optimism we rode led us into one of Israel’s most difficult hours. During the Second Intifada, malls were not safe anymore. Buses were not safe anymore. Life was not safe anymore. The terrorists that detonated these bombs were blind to race, religion, or age. Their targets were not soldiers, but civilians. And during the 2002 Passover massacre, I was the target. That night, we watched news broadcasts instead of celebrating the holiday, and my generation of hope suddenly felt the bitter sting of betrayal.
Soon, the day came when the members of the “peace generation” were forced to wake up early and go to a big, bleak military base, where mothers cried, fathers waved goodbye awkwardly, and sons and daughters tried on uniforms that were too big for them. My day came too. In 2005, I was deployed to Gaza to participate in “The Disengagement” campaign, a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian territory. Our mission was mentally excruciating—to evacuate Israeli families from their own homes. And yet, part of me hoped that a gesture as dramatic as this on behalf of the Israeli government would start to pave the road toward a resolution, if not peace. But when Hamas used these evacuated homes as bases for launching rockets on Israeli cities, I again experienced a taste that was by this point all too familiar. Once again, I felt the bitterness of disillusionment.
When I came to Harvard, I hoped that I could leave this sense of disillusionment in Israel. The intellectual bubble I found on campus seemed like the ideal place to experience the same optimism that my “peace generation” had yearned for in Israel. When I joined the organizing team of the Harvard Israel Conference, which opens this Thursday, I realized that I wasn’t alone. Like Harvard’s German, Indian, and Arab students, who had organized similar conferences, we hoped to introduce the Harvard campus to all aspects of our community, including the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Our conference does not ignore the reality of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as some have blatantly and unjustly claimed. On the contrary, we devote half of our panel discussions and the concluding keynote speech to addressing the conflict and innovative peace initiatives. One piece in the Crimson last week even warned against our conference because at Harvard, “we are sometimes told that even war criminals must be given a place at the table.” This dangerous insinuation attempts to harm the legitimacy of the conference’s speakers, many of whom have devoted their lives to the pursuit of peace, including a former American Middle-East envoy, or the founder of a venture capital fund that targets the Palestinian IT sector. Additionally, we have launched a campus-wide peace innovation competition, challenging students from all walks of life to rethink the peace process, something we can only do at a place like Harvard.
Would-be critics of the conference ought to take a look at the program before dismissing it as an event that “offers merely more of the same.” I wonder if those who vandalized our posters last week had ever stopped for a moment to think about our message. Whenever I go home, I struggle to convince members of my generation, who have long become cynical about the possibility of peace, that we can and must reintroduce peace to the region. Yet some critics of the Israel Conference, who cynically attempt to put the entire blame for the perpetuation of this conflict on Israel, force me to question this myself. But I refuse to be disillusioned again. If at Harvard we can’t embrace these rare opportunities to think outside the box, where else will we? For the sake of both parties in this conflict, disillusionment cannot be an option.

Temperatures approaching 90 degrees did not deter dedicated Harvard marathoners, who raced the 26.2 miles from Hopkington, Mass., to downtown Boston on the hottest April 16 in recorded Boston history. Harvard students and faculty, some participating for the first time and others well-versed in the event, stepped up to the starting line at 9 a.m.
While some were focused on beating personal goals, others were simply trying to cross the finish line in the extremely hot weather.
Daniel E. Lieberman ’86, a professor of Human Evolutionary Biology who has done extensive research on running, ran his second Boston Marathon on Monday, finishing in 4 hours and 19 minutes, his slowest time ever.
“It was brutal conditions for a marathon,” Lieberman said. “Any marathon is challenging, but today’s was especially challenging.”
Lieberman said that he felt the heat  had a significant impact on the race.
“I saw a lot of people in medical tents and I saw a woman collapse at the end,” he said. “If it hadn’t been for all the people on the side with ice and water, I wouldn’t have made it.”
Along with handing out ice and water, the crowd sprayed contestants with water hoses and splashed runners with cold liquids.
Stephanie Choi ’13 ran her fifth marathon—and her third Boston Marathon—in four hours and three seconds. She said that she “definitely ran slower” because of the heat.
“My time was around 30 minutes slower,” she said. “A lot of people around me were puking or needed medical help, so I was just glad that I finished.”
However, not all runners felt the heat was a major obstacle.  William L. Fletcher Jr. ’12, who ran his first marathon on Monday, said the heat did not really bother him, although he did “take advantage of some ice.”
For Fletcher, the marathon was about more than just personal achievement. His marathon efforts raised $5,000 for the South Boston Boys and Girls Club. Fletcher said a major factor in his decision to run was the feeling of the clock ticking on his time at Harvard.
“It was really something I wanted to do before I graduated,” Fletcher said.
Fletcher, who ran the marathon in just over four hours, said that he enjoyed the entire race despite the intense heat and noted that he was especially encouraged by the energy of the crowd.
“It felt good the whole way through and felt great at the finish, but the best part was all the fans and everyone cheering you on the whole way even if they didn’t know your name,” Fletcher said. “It was really inspiring and motivational.”
Ali E. Evans ’13, who ran the race in about four and a half hours and reached his personal goal, echoed Fletcher’s sentiments about the “super supportive” crowd.
Evans, who took up running to fill the void left when he quit Harvard football, emphasized the benefits he said that he attained from training for and running in the marathon.
“I think running a marathon­—it’s not for everyone—but it’s a great experience to get you a lot of discipline, to overcome challenges,” Evans said.

Bo Guagua, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School entangled in an international controversy surrounding the political downfall of his father, former Communist Party Leader Bo Xilai, left his Cambridge apartment with uniformed officials last week, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Details surrounding his departure remain murky in The Journal’s coverage, which suggested that he departed with a private security detail. The Daily Telegraph reported that he was escorted from the apartment by government officials, possibly from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
The Telegraph also reported that Bo Guagua was driven away from his two-bedroom apartment on Mass. Ave. in a dark SUV last Thursday, accompanied by a friend. Some reports speculated that this incident may be connected to a plan for Bo Guagua to seek asylum in the U.S. from persecution in China.
“He did not look frightened, but he seemed anxious to go with them,” a source told The Telegraph of Bo Guagua’s demeanor. “He had clearly been expecting it.”
Bo Guagua, who was due to receive a Masters in Public Policy next month, has remained largely removed from the public eye. Bo Guagua’s last clear public communication followed his father’s removal from his position as party leader last month.
“My personal desire is to focus on my studies and be left out of the political intrigues,” he wrote in an email to The Times of London last month.
Following his departure, Bo Guagua’s enrollment status remains unclear. HKS declined to provide information regarding Bo Guagua’s enrollment to The Crimson, and Bo Guagua could not be reached for comment.
Officials in China removed the elder Bo from his position as party secretary of China’s Chongqing municipality in March and then ousted him from the Politburo—China’s most influential political body—the following month.
The reasons for his rapid downfall are not entirely clear, but include allegations of corruption and overextension of power.
There has also been a great deal of publicity surrounding Bo Guagua’s connections with the late Neil Heywood, a British businessman who lived in China until his death last fall. Bo Guagua’s mother, Gu Kailai, was arrested for Heywood’s murder earlier this month.
Heywood is thought to have served as a mentor to Bo Guagua by helping him gain admission to Harrow—a prestigious English secondary school—and Oxford University.
Chinese authorities said that the family’s relationship with Heywood soured following “a conflict over economic interests,” according to a report in The Daily Mail.
While he was a student in England, Bo Guagua’s behavior came under scrutiny as reporters examined rumors of his father’s corruption.
Many questioned how the family could afford to underwrite the private education and the glamorous social life of their son, who was well known for throwing lavish parties and driving a red Ferrari in Beijing.

When Matt returns home to a small town near the Mexican border, he leaves behind more than just his textbooks and blockmates. He leaves behind his identity.
Back home, Matt is no longer a staunch liberal, an advocate for immigrant rights, or a leader in the Latino community.
But mostly, he is no longer gay.
To be “out” in his close-knit, religious community, Matt says, is a choice that could have potentially dangerous consequences.
Matt—whose name, like that of each student featured in this story, has been changed to protect his privacy—is only one of many LGBTQ students at Harvard who remain predominantly in the closet at home, even though they are fully out at school.
Though some of these students say they have experienced anxiety and depression as a result of their decision, they also say that they have found a welcoming and supportive environment while at Harvard and hope to some day reconcile their sexual identity and their home life.
THE HOME FRONT
For these students, a number of potential conflicts, ranging from personal religious beliefs to family dynamics, have complicated the process of sharing their sexual orientations with their communities at home.
Matt says people who have come out in his community are often bullied, ostracized, and unwittingly become the “talk the town.” Though a few members of his extended family are gay, Matt says they’re often considered “low functioning” or “deadbeats.”
“It makes me think that if I were to come out, that it would challenge the notions of that, but I’d still rather not at this time,” he adds.
Deeply religious, Matt says that growing up he felt that God hated him. He struggled to reconcile his sexuality with his religious beliefs and the negative perceptions of gay people in his family and community during high school. He kept his relationships with other men a secret, dated people exclusively from other towns, and only confided in a few close friends.
As a result of the secrecy and suppression during his high school years, Matt says going to Harvard was very liberating.
“Here I can say whatever I want about race, sexuality, and gender, and the worst I’m going to get labeled is that one crazy kid with all those opinions,” Matt says. “If I talk about these things at home, I get labeled things like faggot.”
Like Matt, Erica had trouble reconciling her devotion to Christianity and her sexuality until her sophomore year at Harvard. Though she comes from New York City, Erica says her struggle to accept her sexuality was made even more challenging by the contradiction it creates with her religious convictions.
As a senior, however, she says she has come to terms with her identity.
“I think, retrospectively, I am extremely grateful I am gay because otherwise I wouldn’t have had that kind of focal point to really grapple with my faith,” she adds.
Erica says she started realizing she liked women in high school, but was too busy academically to pursue relationships. When she started college, she identified as bisexual and explored relationships with both men and women.
“I’m not sure if I ever made that active switch, like ‘No I’m not bisexual anymore; I’m a lesbian,’” Erica says. “But it came to the point where I was just not interested in guys anymore.”
Though her parents are not religious, Erica says she is still not comfortable discussing her sexuality with them yet. She and her mom are very close, but Erica says she is unable to talk to her mom about her relationships or the way she has struggled to reconcile her sexuality and her religion.
She adds that she was unsure of how to even broach the subject with her parents.
Conversations, as a result, are limited mostly to school and work.
“I feel like I’ve been so honest with my mom about so many different things, but this is that one hole that she doesn’t really know about,” Erica says.
HOME SWEET HARVARD?
For many students, Harvard fosters a more welcoming environment for them to come out as LGBTQ.
Upon arriving at Harvard freshman year, Erica says she immediately befriended the queer community. Since many of her friends came out, Erica says she never felt discriminated against.
“It could be that I’m oblivious, but Harvard is so accepting,” Erica said.
David says he has encountered a similar dynamic while at Harvard.
He arrived at Harvard still unsure of his sexuality. Once he realized he was gay, a diverse student body and open-minded friends presented a comfortable space for him to come out.
“Had I been at another school, I don’t know if I would be in the same boat right now,” David says. “I still think I’d be just trucking along and suppressing that part of my life.”
A variety of established resources exist at Harvard intended to help students navigate the process of coming out, both at school and at home. For example, CONTACT Peer Counseling’s November event “Out for the Holidays” attracted 60 students, according to the co-directors of the group.
Still, most students agree that the experience of coming out during college is universal and not one specific to Harvard. Though students have found their peers to be accepting and supportive, many have found the resources for students struggling with their identity to be lackluster.
Allison, a current junior, says she sought out advice from CONTACT Peer Counseling, but found their emphasis on feelings rather than solutions unsatisfying.
Similarly, Matt visited Mental Health Services in hopes of finding a clinician who could help him resolve his identity issues. Instead, he says he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and his feelings of depression persisted.
While he adds that there are a few clinicians who specialize in LGBTQ issues, they were often high in demand and appointments were difficult to schedule.
Moreover, some students say that the queer community isn’t always a refuge for those coming out at college.
One of the reasons Matt says he chose to come out was because he realized there was a lack of resources at Harvard for the Latino, LGBTQ community. For Matt, the College was a very “white gay” place.
Realizing this dearth in student life, Matt says he became a more vocal and public figure for LGBTQ issues within the Latino community.
Likewise, both Allison and David did not find solace within the queer organizations. As athletes at Harvard, the two agree that LGBTQ student groups did not necessarily cater to that section of the student body.
Though both are now openly out, they also say that they do not want their sexuality to be a defining characteristic for them or determine the type of groups they participate in on campus.
“I want to be the guy who is gay, not the gay guy,” David says.
THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE HOME
From a small town in the South, Allison says it is unlikely she will ever return to live in her hometown or tell her friends at home that she is gay.
However, she has confided in her parents. While both her mom and dad are liberal, “being accepting of homosexuality in general versus having it happen to your own child is very different,” Allison says.
She says her mother especially had a difficult time processing the news, but has come around since Allison first came out and the two can now discuss Allison’s relationships at school.
“Me being gay and me being a successful Harvard graduate was not compatible in their eyes,” Allison says. “But I think I’ve done a lot to convince them otherwise.”
David also says that it is unlikely that he will ever move back to his hometown. But he still struggles with if, and when, he should tell his Asian immigrant parents, with whom he is very close.
David says he fears disappointing or embarrassing them.
“I grew up hearing things about my wife and kids,” David says. “They’re very traditional in the sense of the stereotypical family values.”
Though going home is a similar source of anxiety for Matt, he says it’s one he feels like he has to confront. While he has always wanted to return home after graduation to fix some of his hometown’s social problems, he says he is not ready to necessarily become a social pariah.
“Home is the place I love and grew up in, but it’s also the place that I hate,” Matt says.
Even at Harvard, Erica says she still fears that her parents will somehow find out about her sexuality. Because Erica comes from a tight-knit immigrant community, she says she has consciously decided to not maintain many friendships with members of her own ethnicity.
“People talk a lot, and for whatever reason parents find out what their kids are doing in college,” she says.
Nevertheless, during this past year Erica says she has been “feeling an itch” to come out to her parents, and may even tell them during the time between when she graduates next month and when she starts medical school in a year. “Maybe this year is the year.”

The Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to officially endorse the Fair Harvard Fund, an initiative that aims to establish a Social Choice Fund to assure that alumni donations go to investments approved by certain environmental, social, and governmental criteria.
The UC’s legislation pledged to help Responsible Investment at Harvard—the student group that launched the Fair Harvard Fund—communicate with the administration and publicize the initiative.
Students who spearheaded the fund’s creation said they hope that with the help of the UC, the Harvard Management Company will agree to take over the Fair Harvard Fund by August 1. The fund has received more that $6,000 of donations since it was launched three weeks ago. The donations are temporarily being held in escrow at Cambridge Savings Bank.
“This is a flagship initiative that has gained a lot of support on campus,” said former UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12, referring to the more than 90 students who sponsored the legislation. “Additional support from the UC would help with pushing this initiative further forward.”
UC President Danny P. Bicknell ’13 said he will send out information later this week in conjunction with Responsible Investment at Harvard detailing the fund’s future.
Students said that they see this is a first step in pushing for more responsible investment practices at Harvard.
“With the Fair Harvard Fund, there is an emphasis on making a social impact as opposed to just making returns,” said Sam F. Wohns ’14, a member of Responsible Investment at Harvard. “It’s a way for donors to feel good about giving back to Harvard instead of worrying where their money is going.”

University Professor Stephen J. Greenblatt was awarded the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction on Monday for his book, “The Swerve: How the World Became Modern.”
Greenblatt’s work traces the ideas explored by Roman philosopher Lucretius in his epic poem “On the Nature of Things.” Greenblatt said the work is “the only major surviving philosophical exposition of the theory that the world was made out of atoms.” After being forgotten for centuries, the poem was rediscovered in 1417. In “The Swerve,” Greenblatt argues that its discovery transformed the fields of academia, art, religion, and philosophy forever.
The Pulitzer board described Greenblatt’s book in its citation as “a provocative book arguing that an obscure work of philosophy, discovered nearly 600 years ago, changed the course of history by anticipating the science and sensibilities of today.”
Greenblatt was inspired to write “The Swerve” after stumbling upon a copy of Lucretius’s work in a bin of used books during his undergraduate years at Yale. He purchased the poem for 10 cents, drawn to it, he said, by the cover rather than by the content.
When he actually read the poem that summer, he was intrigued. He would return to it many years later when writing his award-winning book.
Greenblatt said winning the Pulitzer Prize filled him with “astonishment and wonder.” He said he found out Monday—the day the 2012 Pulitzer winners were announced—after receiving a call from an AP photographer who wanted to take his photo.
“I didn’t know I was even being considered,” Greenblatt said.
“The Swerve” previously won the 2011 National Book Award for nonfiction. Pulitzer Prizes are awarded annually in 21 categories for success in the areas of journalism, literature, and musical composition. Each prize is accompanied by a cash award of $10,000.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Quincy House Resident Dean Judith F. Chapman sent out an email to the Quincy community this past Thursday requesting that students refrain from calling the Harvard University Police Department with noise complaints.
Chapman’s email came in response to concerns from two Quincy residents who had seen their registered parties shut down in the past several weeks by HUPD for noise complaints before 2 a.m., which is the required end time for a weekend room party.
Writing that she sees party registration as “a temporary, *reasonable* noise permit,” Chapman urged Quincy residents who were bothered by loud party music to first contact the party hosts to resolve the issue.
She instructed students to reach out to the on-call tutor rather than HUPD if they are uncomfortable reaching out to the party hosts, or if they feel that the noise level is “unreasonable and unhealthy.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Chapman said she thought the students who called HUPD to complain about their neighbor’s party noise represent a small percentage of the House population.
“I think we have a couple of people in the House who expect that they
should be able to study in their room on weekend nights,” Chapman said. “I have empathy for them, but I think if you live in a college dorm it’s reasonable to expect to not be able to sleep before 2
a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.”
Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell, who declined to comment on the situation in Quincy, said she expects Adams residents to reach out to loud neighbors before calling HUPD.
However, Howell said she “would never want to discourage people from calling HUPD,” and believed it would be appropriate to call the police about “chronic noises” coming from an unidentifiable source.
Both Chapman and Howell said that HUPD “rarely” shuts down parties in their Houses.
Quincy House resident Jeremy Patashnik ’12, who has had two parties shut down in his room by HUPD this semester, did not reach out to Chapman directly but spoke with one of the student hosts who had complained to the resident dean.
Patashnik said he thinks that when students cause House parties to be shut down unnecessarily, they interfere with efforts to create alternative social spaces to final clubs.
“One noise complaint from one individual doesn’t outweigh the fact that fifty or sixty people are having a good time,” he said.
Patashnik said that he and his roommates had not received any complaints from his neighbors or the on-call tutor before HUPD shut down their parties in response to a noise complaint call.
Quincy House Committee Co-Chair Catherine G. Katz ’13 said that while she sympathizes with students who are sensitive to noise levels in their hallways, she doesn’t think they should direct their calls immediately to HUPD.
Quincy’s room party registration form suggests that party hosts alert their neighbors in advance about an upcoming party, and provide a phone number they can call “before filing a complaint with HUPD.”
HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano could not be reached for comment.

Jincey Lumpkin, known to some as the “lesbian Hugh Hefner” and the founder of Juicy Pink Box—a lifestyle brand that creates, among other things, erotic videos of lesbian fantasies—argued for a more comprehensive understanding of sexual consent at a lecture on Monday night.
Lumpkin said that much of what separates her brand of videos from the rest of the industry is her commitment to producing content that is exciting without promoting morally questionable relationships.
“There are a lot of inappropriate relationships portrayed in porn today, like fathers and daughters,” she said. “I just don’t think people should be encouraging inappropriate relationships.”
She said that part of her strong feelings against such relationships stem from her own sexual abuse as a child at the hands of her father.  She said that often, porn portrays sexual actors persisting despite requests to stop.
“There are a lot of depictions of characters going on despite when someone says ‘no.’ That is not okay. If someone says no, then you stop,” she said. “No one wants to get raped.”
Lumpkin went onto say that sexual acts, whether depicted on screen or in real life, should only be pursued when people give informed consent, which she emphasized “is not just saying yes.”
“In order to give informed consent, the individual must have adequate reasoning faculties and be in possession of all relevant facts at the time consent is given,” Lumpkin said.
Lumpkin also discussed her reasons for founding Juicy Pink Box, saying that much of her motivation for founding the company emerged from what she perceived as a dearth of realistic lesbian porn.
“I wanted to create something that was not mainstream, but to create something that was arousing to me, but was still beautiful,” she said.
Students who attended the event appreciated Lumpkin’s frank discussion about what qualifies as consent.
“I think she did a great job of discussing the more difficult aspects of consent, which is an important topic that is not really discussed here,” said Arthur D. Kaynor ’12, a co-director of Peer Contact Counseling, one of the co-sponsors of the event.
Abby P. Sun ’13 echoed Kaynor’s sentiment.
“I think it is really important to understand that it is unequivocally not okay to have sex without consent,” Sun said. “I thought she did a great job of getting that message across.”
The lecture was part of Harvard’s annual “Take Back the Night” initiative, which sponsors a number of speakers and events throughout the month of April, discussing the connections between such topics as sexual assault, rape, race, porn, and pop culture, among others. The primary purpose of “Take Back the Night” is to educate college students about sexual assault and sexual health.

Yesterday the MLB came together for Jackie Robinson Day. Players, coaches, and managers all wore number 42 (which was officially retired from the league in 1997) and Rachel Robinson, Jackie’s widow, was honored in Yankee stadium before the team’s game against the Angels. And as America’s favorite pastime celebrated one of its best players, the country also celebrated a man who bravely broke racial lines for the love of his sport.
When President Ronald Regan posthumously awarded Jackie Robinson with the Presidential Award of Freedom, he praised him for striking “a mighty blow for equality, freedom and the American way of life.” And even today Robinson is still celebrated as a hero in the civil rights movement.
But when Robinson came to Harvard on Monday, April 24, 1950, he did not come to discuss race relations or the still-applicable “Separate but Equal” standard. No, Robinson came to talk about what he did. He came to talk about baseball.
Robinson came to speak about his success in college sports, his decision to pursue baseball at the professional level, and his tips for bolstering the faltering Harvard team. A Crimson article about the event also promised that Robinson would “give some hints to college baseball stars with big league aspirations.”
In 1972, when Robinson died, that The Crimson ran another piece on Robinson, describing his life achievements on and off the field. And in 1997, the paper described him as the man “who broke the color barrier.”
But those lucky 100 Harvard students who heard him talk in Emerson Hall back in 1950 were not just there to see the MLB’s first black baseball player. According to a Crimson article, they “turned out to get a look at the National League's batting champion and most valuable player.”
And while the fall of the MLB’s color barrier should never be forgotten, neither should the roar of the crowd when Robinson stole home in the opening game of the 1955 World Series against the New York Yankees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the final horn of the season sounds for a senior athlete, what lies ahead? Does the ball keep bouncing or do the gym shoes finally get hung up?
For three Crimson seniors whose successful college basketball careers have come to a close, new opportunities on the court sit just on the horizon.
Brogan Berry, co-captain of the women’s basketball team, led the Crimson to three NIT berths in four years, while both men’s basketball co-captains, Keith Wright and Oliver McNally helped transform Harvard into back-to-back Ivy champions after decades of futility.
But does this type of success at the college level translate into professional basketball? The three soon-to-graduate seniors are excited to find out.
OLIVE THE LIGHTS
For McNally, long-term aspirations to play at the next level are finally in sight.
“It’s always been a dream of mine to play professional basketball,” said the co-captain, who is currently looking for an agent.
In learning the ins and outs of planning a professional basketball career, McNally has turned to his coaching staff for advice.
“Every single one of our coaches makes themselves extremely available,” McNally said. “Coach Amaker and I have developed a great relationship, and he’s been totally available to help me out and discuss the process.”
As McNally searches for a team, he has his sights set on Western Europe, Ireland in particular.
“I’ve always wanted to go to Ireland,” McNally said. “I’m Irish and its something that I’ve always hoped to do.”
The prospect of playing professionally overseas promises more than simply top-notch basketball for McNally. The 6’3” guard hopes that heading to Europe will be a learning experience and provide an opportunity to see the world.
“I’m really looking forward to continue playing and being able to use [basketball] as a tool to live abroad and learn a new language while still competing at a high level,” McNally said.
Beyond basketball, McNally is open to many future career possibilities and said that his experiences at Harvard have prepared him for whatever he does.
“The responsibility I’ve had being a captain over the past two years and being on a team where you learn to give a little on your end and work with other people is something that’s very useful…whether it’s business, basketball, or whatever,” McNally said.
But it’s not business that’s on McNally’s mind at the moment.
“The one thing that I’m confident about is that I’m going to go play basketball next year,” McNally said.
BERRY NICE
Fellow senior Brogan Berry has similar aspirations, as she sets her sights on playing professionally overseas as well.
“Ideally I’d like to either play in Spain or France, but I’ll play anywhere that I have a good, safe situation for my first year,” Berry said.
Berry has also spent a lot of time since her senior season ended learning what it takes to logistically attain a professional contract. In addition to her coaches, Berry has reached out to alumni who have taken the same path to professional hoops in Europe. Like McNally, Berry is also looking to sign with an agent soon.
On her end, Berry plans to send out films and ink a contract by summer so that she will be playing by early fall.
When her basketball career does ultimately come to a close, Berry already has a plan in mind.
“When I come back, I’d like to go to a city hopefully, I really enjoy Chicago,” Berry said. “I’d really like to get involved with a franchise of some sport. There’s definitely a lot of sports and industry in Chicago, so I’d love to get my foot in the door there.”
WRIGHT ON TRACK
As Keith Wright considers plans for his career, he shares similar ambitions with McNally and Berry to play at the next level. But Wright—who was named to the Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 Watch List—isn’t looking across the pond.
“I have plans of continuing my basketball career,” Wright said. “Hopefully it’s here in the States playing in the best league in the world, the NBA.”
As the 6’8” forward looks to take the next step in his career, he’s turned to family to help guide him along.
“My mom is definitely an important piece,” Wright said. “I also have family members that know about the process.”
In addition to Wright’s family ties, Harvard’s most famous basketball alumnus, Jeremy Lin ’10, has also sent along some advice.
“Jeremy Lin has also been talking to me a little bit,” Wright said. “He has been giving me advice on the whole agent process as well as the Portsmouth Invitational, which I played in this weekend.”
For Wright, his plans after a professional basketball career bring him back to school.
“After the ball is done bouncing, I plan on going back to school to become a couples therapist,” Wright said. “Helping people is something that I have always loved doing.”
A LASTING LEGACY
Senior Andrew Van Nest, the only other player to spend four years with Wright and McNally on the Harvard men’s basketball team, commended his long-time teammates.
“Our class started off with seven and now it’s down to three,” Van Nest said. “I’m glad that two of us are going to continue to play at a really high level, and honestly as high as they want to go.”
“Keith in his nation-wide success, and Oliver with his leadership, it definitely suits them both to keep going,” Van Nest continued.
Regardless of the future professional endeavors, Brogan, McNally, and Wright have all witnessed history in a Crimson uniform.
For Berry, that meant leading Harvard to a 73-71 win over Hofstra in the first round of the NIT, the first-ever Ivy League win the tournament.
And accomplishments achieved during McNally and Wright’s tenure have permanently altered the face of Harvard basketball and perhaps Crimson athletics.
“Keith, Oliver, and I always talked about the change in the fan base,” Van Nest said. “We went from playing home games where you could see all the openings in the seats to our senior year, where tickets were going on eBay, where there wasn’t an open spot in the house. It was a night-and-day experience from our freshman year.”
“I think it’s only getting started,” McNally added. “We’ve got a lot of good guys coming back, and Coach Amaker is going to keep bringing in good players.”
The seniors acknowledge that they’ve also learned a lot in their years as Harvard basketball players.
“Your coaches and teammates will be family for the rest of your life,” Berry commented.
But for now, though the trio of seniors has left the confines of Lavietes Pavilion for good, the focus on basketball remains intense.
“I am still worrying about basketball. I am still working out,” Wright said. “There is a lot that I have to do in order to get ready for the level I want to play at.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team competed in three regattas on Saturday and Sunday. It brought home a regional championship in the New England Dinghy Championship, placed third out of eight schools in the Savin Hill Invitational, and 10th of 18 in the 72nd Oberg Trophy.
NEW ENGLAND DINGHY CHAMPIONSHIP
The Crimson snagged the New England Championship this weekend, as it sailed to a first place victory over the best teams in the region. The victory qualified the team for the national semifinals, which will be held at Navy next month.
Harvard needed to place in the top eight of the field of 18 to make it to the semifinals. After the first day of the two-day regatta, Harvard was in third, with only a small margin separating the top 10 teams.
“On Sunday morning, we were basically still just hoping to qualify,” said senior Emily Lambert, who skippered the B division boat.
But on Sunday, as the Crimson ranked among the top five in more than half of the second day’s races, it became clear that they were going to clinch a spot in the semifinals, and the team started to look toward the possibility of winning the championship.
“At the end, the points got pretty close,” Lambert said. “But we were able to hold on until the end and walk away with the victory.”
Harvard led much of the early part of the regatta, as the A and B boats finished third and second in the first round, respectively, but dropped to second behind Dartmouth after the B division’s 11th place finish in the second round. Harvard quickly came back, with A and B boats finishing second and third, respectively, in the next round to regain the lead. It held onto first place and went into the sixth round with 51 points—eight ahead of eventual fifth place finishers Boston College—but then hit a rough patch.
The Crimson dropped as low as eighth in the rankings after a series of weak performances in the next four races, including a last-place finish for the B division, but quickly followed it up as, in the last three races of the day, the top boat came in third, seventh, and fifth, while the B boat finished in fifth, second, and tenth.
In the 14th round, the A division team grabbed a second-place finish, as the B boat topped that division, landing Harvard back in first place.
From then on, it was the Crimson’s regatta to lose. And though Roger Williams did pull within five points after the 16th race, Harvard did not again cede the lead.
The A boat came in fourth, four points ahead of the team from MIT, while the B division team earned sixth place.
Sophomore Sarah Pierson, who crewed the A division boat, recognized the home field advantage that came with sailing on the Charles River.
“We definitely knew we had an advantage because we were used to the conditions on the river,” Pierson said. “There was a lot of pressure because only the top eight teams qualify for national semifinals, so we just needed to make sure we sailed consistently well.”
Like Pierson, Lambert was focused primarily on making it to the semifinals.
“It’s exciting to win,” Lambert said. “But in the larger picture, we were really just focusing on nationals.”
Senior Brendan Kopp, who skippered the A division boat, credited the B division team with a huge boost for the Crimson team.
“Everyone sailed incredibly well,” Kopp said. “In particular, Emily Lambert and [freshman] Brian Drumm sailed awesome in B Division. They were killing it. It was really nice to look up in between our races and see Emily and Brian in the front of the pack almost every time. They were really carrying our team.”
Kopp also lauded the team’s land division for their work in the meet. Kopp said in a text message that the land division, which gives boats a necessary tune up between sets—like a pit crew in NASCAR—“was awesome this weekend.”
SAVIN HILL INVITATIONAL
Harvard sophomores Morgan Russom, Isabel Ruane, Caitlin Watson, and Jacquelyn Cooley competed across town in the Savin Hill Invitational, hosted by Boston College, bringing the Crimson a third place finish. The B division pair, Watson and Cooley, came in third, giving Harvard the edge over fourth place Roger Williams. Russom and Ruane manned the A division boat and captured a fifth-place finish.
72ND OBERG TROPHY
Meanwhile, sophomores Ames Lyman and Luke O’Connor and freshmen Mary Katherine Finlayson and Rebecca Frankel faced off in the 72nd Oberg Trophy. The Crimson came in 11th overall, with Lyman and Finlayson from the A division finishing 12th and O’Connor and Frankel taking eighth in the B division.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yale pitcher Chelsey Dunham could be forgiven if she was a little nervous in the first inning of game two of Sunday’s doubleheader against the Harvard softball team. Two batters into the game, her team had already committed an error, allowing a Crimson runner into scoring position—and Harvard sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange was stepping into the batter’s box. Lange had already recorded eight hits off Bulldogs pitchers in the weekend’s previous three games, including two off of Dunham in the first three innings of Saturday’s first contest.
And as Lange demonstrated with a double to right center, there was good reason to worry. The extra-base hit scored the first run of what would be a 9-2 victory, which secured a four-game sweep for the Crimson over their arch rivals.
The double capped a prolific weekend at the plate for Lange, in which she went a combined 10-of-14 with four doubles and nine RBI, helping the Crimson outscore the Bulldogs, 49-6, over the course of the four-game set, which included three run-rule shortened victories.
Lange’s big weekend was the encore to a week in which she batted .615 and slugged .923, earning Ivy Player of the Week honors for the second time this season. Her ten-game hitting streak was snapped in a loss at Rhode Island on April 10, but Lange has now hit safely in 14 of her last 15 contests.
Though she has been in particularly fine form lately, Lange has terrorized opposing pitchers all season. She currently ranks in the top five in the Ivy League in batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage, and leads the conference in RBI.
“I’m seeing the ball well and just in the zone,” Lange said. “As long as we all can collectively stay in a good spot, we will be in good shape for the rest of the season and the Ivy Championships.”
While Lange’s success this season hasn’t been a surprise given her strong freshman campaign, in which she garnered Ivy League and ECAC Rookie of the Year honors, coach Jenny Allard said that Lange’s approach to hitting has matured, as she is now more patient at the plate.
“People know she’s a strong hitter, so they are being careful,” Allard said. “Early in the season, mid-season, she was starting to reach and swing at pitches out of the zone. Now she’s become more patient and waiting for pitches to get in her zone. She’s taking more walks, and we have Stephanie Regan behind her, so we’ve got a clutch hitter behind her if they walk her.”
Lange attributed some of her success to the overall strength of the Crimson offense, which, as a team, leads the Ivy League in batting average (by a sizable 32 points), on base percentage, hits, and runs scored. In conference play, Harvard has outscored its opponents by an average of 6.3 runs per game.
“If I end up getting on base through a walk, whoever is up behind me will step up and get the job done,” Lange said. “I don’t feel the pressure to have to be the one because there is someone behind me who can do the job. We definitely try to pass the bat and keep the hits coming one hit after the other.”
That offense has been the catalyst to Harvard’s success all season. With a record of 24-10, including a league-best 11-1 against Ancient Eight competition, the Crimson has been the class of the Ivy League.
“This weekend, it felt like nobody could stop us from scoring and [Lange] was a big part of that,” captain Rachel Brown said.  “Two years ago, there were games where we couldn’t buy a run. This year, especially this weekend, it feels like we are able to score on command, and she’s a huge factor in that ability.”
Scoring on command certainly seems like a good description of Harvard’s offense in conference play, as the Crimson has been held to no fewer than four runs against Ivy opponents. And with help from Lange’s big bat, Harvard has positioned itself for a run at its second consecutive Ivy League Championship, making a few more pitchers anxious in the process.
“I think that every team sees her as a threat,” Brown said. “If she’s up with runners on, sometimes you can see the pitchers are pitching very carefully to her because they’d rather walk her than take the risk. And frankly, sometimes that is the better option.”

Sunday, Flyby wandered Harvard Square and the surrounding area, asking people to divulge their secrets (identities kept completely anonymous, of course). Between the wealth of confused faces and people who just walked away, we got some interesting stories:
1. Token Tourist (wearing a Harvard sweatshirt, holding a very large camera, and standing in front of the John Harvard statue).
Flyby:  Hi, I'm a reporter for the Harvard Crimson. Can I ask you a question?
TT: You...go to Harvard?
Flyby: Yeah.
TT: Sure.
Flyby: Can you tell me a secret?
TT: What?
Flyby: A secret. Tell me something that no one knows—I won't tell anyone it's you.
TT: Okay…
Flyby: Come on. Just one thing. I won't tell anyone.
TT: Well, I guess. [Whispers into Flyby's ear]. I have a dead body in my basement.
Flyby: Really? No you don't.
TT: [shakes head]. No, I don't. But wouldn't that be great for your article?
2. Person Taking Advantage of the Sun (sitting in Harvard Yard on a blanket, wearing shorts and flip-flops).
Flyby: Hi, I'm a reporter for The Harvard Crimson. Tell me a secret.
PTAOTS: So that you can put it in the paper? No.
Flyby: I won't reveal your identity.
PTAOTS: You promise? [Smiles].
Flyby: Of course I do.
PTAOTS: Okay. You ready?
Flyby: Yeah.
PTAOTS: I don't go here.
Flyby: What?
PTAOTS: I go to Wellesley. I just come to Harvard for the parties.
Flyby: So it actually happens.
PTAOTS: Of course it does [laughs]. My friends and I come on Saturday afternoons, do work in Harvard Yard, and find a party to go to in the evening.
Flyby: But it's Sunday afternoon now.
PTAOTS: Yeah.
Flyby: I take it Saturday night got a little carried away?
PTAOTS: Yeah…
3. Student Walking by the River (wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt, carrying a blue backpack, trying to text message while walking).
Flyby: Hi, I'm a reporter for The Crimson. Do you have a secret that you want to tell me?
SWBTR: What? No.
Flyby: Come on. I'm writing a story about secrets, and I need one more. I won't tell people who you are.
SWBTR: Well, I guess. What kind of secret?
Flyby: Anything really. Preferably something interesting.
SWBTR: Okay. I went in the steam tunnels once.
Flyby: Harvard's steam tunnels?
SWBTR: No, Yale's—yes of course Harvard's steam tunnels.
Flyby: Wow. Okay. How were they?
SWBTR: They were awesome. I went almost a quarter mile underground.
Flyby: Did you break in?
SWBTR: Yeah, I went right through the basement of—

Location, location, location. In possibly one of the best spots on campus, the dorm room of freshmen Andres Gonzalez, Joey J. Kim, Samuel T. Kim, and Erik C. Schluntz is only a minute away from Annenberg and the Science Center. In their Holworthy suite, the four roommates have an expansive black-and-white themed common room with brick walls and two spacious double bedrooms that overlook the Science Center.
"Our tastes all complemented each other. We all agreed that a classy room would be best," Samuel Kim said.
They have tried to give the room a homey-vibe by fixing up and adding their own touches to old pieces of furniture. The four repainted an old table, which now complements their color scheme. From the glass chessboard to the collection of CS50 balls to their bamboo plant named "Tom," objects throughout the room let their personalities shine through.
The newly covered couch is also a focal point in the room, creating an environment to both study and socialize. "The white board is another factor that makes this a social study space," Samuel Kim said. Great for physics homework, the white board makes trips to Lamont unnecessary.
But the highlight of the room is the fire escape, which doubles as a private balcony. Not many freshmen can claim to have balconies, and the residents of this Holworthy suite know that theirs is a praise-worthy feature. "It is the nicest room ever," Schluntz said.
Overall, the room's size and unique factors along with the effort that the four have put into its decoration set it apart from a typical dorm. "We take a lot of pride in our room. We try to make it as nice as possible," Samuel Kim said.
With some tips from the residents, you too can turn your dorm room into the ultimate comfortable space.
Tips:
1. Maximize space. "Some people comment on how we've stacked up bookshelves, which I think is pretty helpful," Samuel Kim said.
2. "Just clean. We clean once a week," Schluntz said.
3. "Keep it classy,' Samuel Kim concluded.

After internal rumblings of poll tampering, Winthrop withdrew today from its alliance with Adams, leaving the Plympton St. residence without allies in its war against Currier, Pfoho, Mather, and Cabot.
As reported by Flyby on Monday, a poll was sent out to Winthrop residents to determine whether the House should ally with Adams. According to Winthrop HoCo Co-Chair Lauren E. Tiedemann '13, 100 Winthrop residents completed the poll and just around 60 percent voted in favor of allying. Winthrop residents, however, expressed doubt about the veracity of the poll result in emails sent over the House list, THROPTALK.
In a message sent to Winthrop at 11:15 a.m. this morning, Tiedemann assured the House that the poll was evaluated fairly, yet nonetheless announced Winthrop's retreat from the war. The email exlained, "This entire war was meant to be an entertaining joke; I feel like many have lost sight of this. Therefore, Winthrop will no longer be at war or allied with any houses."
This certainly is a change of pace, considering that earlier this week Winthrop not only pledged alliance to Adams but also declared war on Lowell House, making demands regarding access to Lowell's infamous back gate.
Tiedemann expressed regret at the way in which the war has been handled. "I wish I had never gotten involved but as HoCo chair I had to. If we hadn't done anything people would complain about how we don't do enough," Tiedemann said.
With this as the latest news, it is clear that the war is getting serious. Stay tuned for updates.
