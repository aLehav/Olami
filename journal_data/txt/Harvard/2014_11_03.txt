After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s planned changes to employee health benefits for 2015 are a painful example of a flawed process leading to bad policy ideas. Although the new plans won’t affect members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers when they are implemented in January, HUCTW leaders have studied the changes carefully because we are concerned about the whole Harvard health care system and its impact on all of our co-workers—faculty and staff, union and non-union.
The factual basis and policy rationale for the changes are unnecessarily mysterious. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 has said the new plans were recommended by the University Benefits Committee. But thousands of deeply affected Harvard employees don’t know who is on the UBC, because a full list of Committee members has not been made public. Few in the community had any idea that this kind of change was being considered. If details of the UBC’s research and analysis have been documented, no one except Committee members and senior administrators has seen them.
More broadly, Harvard’s Human Resources administration seems strangely reluctant to share basic information. How much does the University pay for our health care, how has the cost changed in recent years, and what have been the effects of other plan changes meant to control costs? We have no idea, and many in the employee community are baffled as to why administrators won’t share the data.
The particulars of the plan changes are somewhat complicated, with new deductibles and co-insurance that are unfamiliar to most staff and faculty who are enrolled in Harvard’s popular HMO plans. But the consequences are straightforward. Any employee (or covered family member) who needs treatment more serious than a routine annual exam will pay significantly more out-of-pocket. Harvard will pay for a smaller share of our health care, and employees will pay more. The impact will be most severe on lower-paid employees, and the greatest burden will fall on our co-workers with families or chronic health problems. With each employee now at risk for as much as $4,500 per year in new health-related expenses, it’s no wonder faculty and non-union staff are voicing growing concerns about potentially destructive effects.
The strategy of shifting costs onto employees through higher deductibles and co-insurance is more of an HR fad than an academically tested solution. In fact, there is some suggestion in the health economics literature that increased cost-shifting onto patients may lead to higher total costs in the long-term, as employees decide not to seek beneficial care and get sicker.
There are better ways to control the cost of health benefits by helping employees to be healthier and by supporting informed decisions about where and how to receive care. In September, HUCTW issued a report that lays out “Seven Good Ideas for Bending the Health Care Cost Curve,” with the potential to reduce Harvard’s medical spending by up to $6 million per year. The ideas came from Union leaders’ discussions with Harvard faculty members about their research into strategies that improve health outcomes, rather than simply pushing a greater share of the cost onto patients.
The cost of health care is a big problem, a complicated issue, and an area of keenly shared interest between Harvard and all of its employees. Because it is so important, we need a very different approach to policy-making with more transparency and more engagement. University administrators should share information about health care spending fully and regularly, so that energetic, committed staff and faculty can engage in a search for innovative and progressive solutions. We do our best work when we take on challenges as a community, honestly and inclusively. Harvard’s health plan changes for 2015 are poorly aligned with employee needs and with the most hopeful strategies emerging in faculty research. The complex and urgent nature of the health care problem demands that we do better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A great deal of ink has been spent on the upcoming governor’s race between Charlie Baker and Martha Coakley, but this coming election in Massachusetts also offers voters a chance to decide several key ballot measures. One of the more contentious is Question 1, a referendum petition that seeks to overturn last year’s legislative vote that linking state gas taxes to inflation.
Question 1 looks to repeal last year’s decision—in other words, a “yes” vote will unlink gas taxes from inflation; a “no” vote will keep the status quo.
Proponents of Question 1 cite the concern that a linked gas tax will lead to a state of “taxation without representation”—a loaded claim for residents of Massachusetts. However, this argument does not stand the test of reason. Future changes to the gas tax will not be arbitrary. Tying the taxes to inflation makes sense, as inflation accounts for the rise of residents’ incomes, spending, and even other taxes. Income taxes, for example, depend upon a percentage of one’s income, and thus increase year-to-year based on how inflation affects one’s income.
The yearly change will also correlate with changes in maintenance costs, which the tax is supposed to fund. Statistics from the Federal Highway Administration show that over half the bridges in Massachusetts are structurally deficient, for example. Before the gas tax was linked to inflation last year, it had remained steady for 21 years. Thus, for over two decades, while the cost of road maintenance steadily increased, the tax revenue that was meant to support such maintenance was kept static.
Of course, linking the gas tax to inflation does not fix all of Massachusetts’s infrastructure woes. Concern has been raised that, as Mass. residents opt for newer hybrid and fuel-efficient cars, the state’s income from the gas tax will still not match maintenance costs. Further, since the tax is proportioned per gallon, it will weigh more heavily upon those who own older, cheaper, and less fuel-efficient cars—in other words, there is potential that the tax will disproportionately affect those with lower incomes.
But that is an argument for augmenting the gas tax with infrastructure spending, as well as working to support lower-income residents and mitigate any disproportionate effects. It is not an argument against inflation-indexing. A common-sense “no” on Question 1 will make Massachusetts a safer state.
Two less controversial petitions are worth highlighting, too. Question 2 seeks to heighten incentives for recycling by expanding the “deposit” on recyclable beverage containers to bottled water, juice, and sports drinks. The “deposit” is added to the cost of the beverage, but is returned if the consumer returns the bottles for recycling. Voting “yes” will further encourage Massachusetts residents to recycle, and unclaimed deposits will go toward funding environmental programs within the state.
If passed, Question 4 will require all Massachusetts employers with eleven or more employees to provide paid sick leave based on the number of hours employees work. Not only will such a provision lower the risk of disease transmission between customers and sick employees, it is also humane. Workers should not be force to choose between holding a job and caring for themselves or for a child when they are ill. While this regulation might have a slight negative effect on businesses, it is a cost that business-owners should bear.

As a wide-eyed freshman, trying to contain my twitching excitement for the next brilliant and formational four years of my life, I came to Harvard ready to participate in, as Dean Khurana put it, “the pursuit of connecting with people who are different from you and learning from them.”
As a part of the amazing and extremely diverse class Harvard had assembled, I was about to interact with a fantastic group of peers to challenge the views I formed from my Jewish, upper-middle class, suburban household with Russian-Polish ancestry. It was thrilling.
But two years later, as a junior, I sat on the couch of my dorm room with a couple of familiar faces: two young men raised in Jewish, upper-middle class, suburban households with Russian-Polish ancestry, who happen to be my two (and only two) roommates.
It only hit me a few weeks ago that, even though grade inflation has made it almost impossible to do so, I was failing Harvard. Every administrator from the beginning told me to seek out people different from myself. Despite all that, here I was, sitting on a couch in a room apparently covered in mirrors. Where did I go wrong?
I didn’t mean for that to happen. I go to Hillel events very rarely. When I do, it’s for the food. The clothing I wear, exclusively from Target, doesn’t seem to scream upper-middle class. And the only non-DNA methods of identifying people as a mix of Russian and Polish blood would make the Jew in me very nervous.
The notion of “self-segregating” is common on campus. There are many groups here that bring members together based on their shared athletic and academic interests, parents’ education, geographic background, race, sexual orientation and a number of other factors. These groups form for a variety of reasons. And, often, they form lasting friendships.
As with most phenomena, there seems to be a normal but powerful social psychological force at work here. Studies have shown that people tend to befriend people similar to themselves, in terms of race, personal beliefs, and a host of other factors.
To fight this trend, there’s an obvious solution. We could actively seek out other people of different backgrounds to make sure we build friend groups with a solid level of diversity. Sometimes, it seems the administration’s rhetoric suggests this tactic.
But that strategy has one flaw: In practice, it’s extremely weird.
Let’s think of one particularly cringe-worthy example. According to one estimate, in the 2010-2011 school year, about 45 percent of Harvard students came from families that earn more than $200,000 a year. Only about four percent came from families in the bottom quintile of U.S. incomes. Those figures obviously speak to a broader problem of socioeconomic diversity at Harvard. But, for now, it begs the question: Should the plurality of richer kids actively try to find members of a small minority of poorer kids and befriend them just because their family earns less money? It felt awkward just writing that question. In practice, it would be brutal. And, if one generalized this example, students would be walking around with clipboards, making sure they balance and keep track of their friends with people of different academic, ethnic, athletic or other types of backgrounds.
The natural reaction to such an image is discomfort or disgust. And there’s good reason for that: Such a practice ignores individuality. Ideally, we want to be friends with a person because we like that person, not their academic interests, religious beliefs, wealth of their parents, or color of their skin. In actively pursuing friends because of aspects of backgrounds, we diminish the individuals in the foreground. And that makes the “me” in me very nervous.
Thankfully, there is a middle road. Whether in class or in the House, it’s hard to walk a few steps without finding someone with a fundamentally different background or set of beliefs. Through a natural interest in interacting with others as individuals, it’s easy to be exposed to Harvard’s great diversity in the process.
So that leaves us with the question: is it wrong to “self-segregate?” Is it wrong that somehow, through some mystical social psychological force, I ended up living in a room covered in mirrors, with two young men who come from Jewish, upper middle class suburban homes with Russian-Polish ancestry? Not really. Because, even though we share in familial stories and social contexts, we are diverse. One of us is a science major, the other a social science major, the other a humanities major. We have different personalities. And I’m smarter and better-looking than the other two.
More than that though, we are fundamentally different people. Sure, it may not be the ideal level of “diversity” for which the college advocates. But the “clipboard-style” path to that “diversity ideal” is a strange and scary road. To talk about diversity in such a way is actually to diminish the diversity we see in one another. This is true at Harvard especially—a community of people who stood out as individuals in their home communities to gain admission.
For now, in an unideal world, it’s best to strive for another ideal: to think of groups that share a common trait as a group of diverse individuals, who may or may not share so much more.
Here, or anywhere else really, there are no rooms covered in mirrors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am angry and Asian and this, apparently, is a problem.
I should be a model minority, but I am not. I’m supposed to be successful in school, go on to a higher-paying job, and prove that in America race matters little.
Conservative pundit Bill O’Reilly, for example, denies white privilege because, apparently, Asian-Americans have it all. His ideas trouble for more reasons than I can count. Because I’m not a math concentrator, let’s stick with three.
The most glaring problem with this myth is its Ameri-centricism. The model minority myth makes a generalization about a specific race and applies it to all members of said race. However, the so-called facts that fuel this myth (such as the percentage of academically successful Asian-Americas) are facts solely related to the experience of Asian-identifying persons within the United States. “Hello!” I want to say. “I’m Asian but I’m not from the States!” But I should shut up, because Asians—all Asians; they all look so similar anyway—are quiet.
Second, the myth works to contrast the Asian-American experience from the experience of other racial minorities in America. Of course, each person’s experience is different and should be respected as such. However, by pitting Asian-Americans against African-Americans (as O’Reilly does), people attempt to divert attention away from the real problem—the privileged status of whites in America. This is a pretty classic ploy: divide the underdogs so they don’t realize who their real enemy is.
Third, it relies on the assumption that only overt displays of racism “count” as racism. If Asian-Americans are so successful—even more successful than whites—then why don’t I see more Asian and Asian-American faces in politics? In academia? Why are the Asian actors I see always nerds or martial art fighters? Why is it that I have to be asked where I am “originally” from? Why was I forced to look up to Keanu Reaves as a naive, half-Asian babe?
The flip side—the little sister, if you will—of the model minority myth is the assumption that all Asians are demure. And indeed women are the focus of this prejudice. It is a sexual fetishization, as well as a social one. Just as Asian girls will supposedly put up with job discrimination and sexism and racists jokes (“My little dumpling”), Asian girls will also let you have your way in bed.
After last month’s emails, I was disappointed that Harvard administrators were slow to take the racial hate speech seriously. Part of me wonders if the response was motivated by the notion that Asian-Americans are not a “real” minority—that they have assimilated into mainstream (read: white) American culture.
Perhaps university administrators felt comfortable remaining silent because they couldn’t imagine Asian and Asian-American students on campus voicing outrage in any meaningful way. After all, students of Arab descent are scary because they are all fanatical Islamists, and Latino students are scary because they all sell drugs and black students are scary because black people are scary. Right? But Asians are just nice, baffled tourists with 2400 SAT scores and bad English. Except the Chinese. They’re stealing our jobs.
I’m a little worried Harvard won on this one. It’s been a few weeks, and I’m still fuzzy on who called me “slit-eyes” and why. But what really makes me think that Harvard—and perpetuators of “model minority myth” at large—won is the fact that I saw so little anger. Yes, there was a great piece in Manifesta Magazine written by members of the Asian and Asian-American community at Harvard—but some of the most vocal outrage came from Harvard’s black community, in the form of social media posts. (Thanks!)
It would be unfair, even counterproductive, of me to put the blame on students. This isn’t a problem with people; it’s a problem with a system.
Minority groups aren’t simply restricted in terms of where they live or what they do for a living. We’re not simply restricted in terms of options—we’re restricted in terms of consequences. If Asian and Asian-Americans respond to attacks sans outrage, we seem to be perpetuating the myth that we are demure, we will be quiet. Not so good.
But if we act angry and outraged, we are deemed as being too aggressive—dare I say it, uppity. This is what groups demanding justice for Michael Brown found when they protested outside Busch Stadium found earlier this October. Neither of these options are ideal, and they’re pretty much impossible to balance. You’re either quiet, demure, proving the stereotype—or angry, hot-headed, and headed to prison.
If you aren’t white in America, you can’t even own the outcomes of your actions.

The race for governor of Massachusetts has come down to the wire. Attorney General Martha Coakley and businessman and former state cabinet official Charlie Baker are locked in a dead heat. With Election Day this Tuesday, however, the time has come to make a choice—a choice between two visions, and two very different sets of experiences, for Massachusetts.
Contrary to what Republicans and the Baker campaign might have you believe, Coakley and Baker have clear differences in ideology and priorities. In Martha Coakley, the people have a fighter, an advocate for ordinary Massachusetts families. In Charlie Baker, they have a bureaucrat, a man with a mixed record of public administration. As leader of the AG attorney general’s office, Coakley took Wall Street to task for subprime mortgages and won a string of multi-million dollar settlements for homeowners; Coakley led attorneys general across the nation by filing the first state suit against the Defense of Marriage Act—no longer law thanks to her efforts; and Coakley forced major changes in health care costs through investigations of health care companies gaming the system.
In contrast, Charlie Baker’s track record as an administrator—his chief calling card—leaves much to be desired. While serving under Republican governors William Weld and Paul Cellucci, Baker was chief officer in financing the Big Dig. His plan, and the dramatic cost overruns of the project, left the state transportation system underfunded by $1 billion a year. Throughout the project, he and the Republican administration refused to consider raising taxes, choosing to borrow and neglect other transportation priorities instead.
If Baker is put in charge of financing the state, any budget shortcomings will be met by cutting state programs rather than by raising taxes, as his management of the Big Dig project indicates, and as his actions as Undersecretary of Health and Human Services in the early 1990s suggest. Faced with a budget shortfall or an economic crisis, one can only assume that Baker would cut government programs integral to helping the most vulnerable members of society. By doing so, he would renege on promises made before his tenure, ignoring social responsibility under the guise of fiscal responsibility.
Many Baker supporters argue we need a Republican governor to check our blue-state tendencies. We had an example of this logic at play during the 2000s in California. California elected a moderate Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who served from 2003 to 2011, to solve their massive budget problem. But what were the results?
The Republican government, at least consistent in its anti-tax stance, decided to gouge funding for social services for years. By the end of Schwarzenegger’s term in 2011, $955 million had been cut from the criminal justice system, $510 million from the state’s welfare program (CalWORKS), $121 million from child welfare and foster care, $1.4 billion from Medicaid, $846 million dollars directly out of worker compensation, $2 billion from the CalState and UC systems, and $5.8 billion from K-12 education. In the end, it took a Democratic governor in Jerry Brown working with the Democratic legislature to clean up the mess.
The people of Massachusetts deserve better than Charlie Baker and Republican governance. We need Martha Coakley. Coakley will invest in our citizens. It’s Coakley who has campaigned on ensuring early childhood education for all children, setting them up for success later in life; it’s Coakley who has advocated for significant and much-needed infrastructure improvements across the state to not only create jobs, but also better connect workers and businesses; and it’s Coakley who seeks to economically empower communities across the state (not just Boston) by creating state-local-industry partnerships for revitalization and innovation.
Martha Coakley represents our Massachusetts values of fairness and opportunity. She deserves your vote this Tuesday.

UPDATED: November 3, 2014, at 2:42 p.m.
Undoubtedly, Republican Charlie Baker ’79 has run a stronger campaign for governor this November than he did in 2010. He has pitched himself as a moderate Republican with experience as an effective manager, and he has proposed a raft of ideas and reforms that are more specific and targeted than those proposed by his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Martha Coakley. Yet this election is about more than the candidates themselves. In some ways, it is a referendum Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78’s administration, under whose leadership Massachusetts’ economy and education system have surged to among the best in the country. Despite her failings as a candidate, Coakley is more likely to support and extend Governor Patrick’s successes.
Martha Coakley's ability to connect to the public has been an ongoing problem. Although she has made great progress since her infamously lackluster campaign for Senate four years ago, she still has work to do. She should also make clear once in office that she will govern the Commonwealth as an executive and a representative of all Massachusetts residents, not merely as a bureaucrat. Coakley would also do well to emulate Baker’s managerial mindset and focus on specific policy initiatives.
Baker’s progressive stances on social issues distract from his fiscal conservatism. In his failed 2010 campaign for governor he took a pledge to not raise taxes under any circumstances. His interest in cutting benefits to welfare recipients is worrying, given that homelessness is also a growing problem in the Commonwealth. And the role that many supporters might foresee for him—a sort of foil to an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature—is likely overblown. Working together with Republicans and conservative Democrats, Baker’s general unwillingness to raise taxes and his desire to cut income taxes to five percent would likely undercut important government functions, especially public transportation, job creation initiatives, and Governor Patrick’s generally successful efforts to better fund public schools.
Coakley has been a reliable advocate for children and families, and as Attorney General she has served as an effective champion for victims of domestic violence. She will continue Governor Patrick’s push to make Massachusetts a national leader in alternative energy production. Coakley will also lead the state’s schools to continued success by expanding high quality pre-K to all children, funding student support counselors, and increasing access to community colleges.
Martha Coakley is an unremarkable candidate. But she stands for a solid platform of reforms and policies designed to extend the successes of the Patrick administration. Of the several imperfect candidates on Tuesday’s ballot, Coakley is the Bay State’s best option for its next four years.
CLARIFICATION: November 3, 2014
An earlier version of this article did not denote Charlie Baker as a Harvard College graduate. He is a member of the Class of 1979.

Christopher H. Wiggins, chief data scientist at The New York Times, shared what it means to be a data scientist with a full audience at a seminar organized by the Institute for Applied Computational Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences on Friday afternoon.
Wiggins addressed common misconceptions about the scope of the job of a data scientist before explaining what his job entails: analyzing the data that The New York Times collects from it users when they visit its website to “try to understand user experience.”
He said the role of a data scientist is especially important in an age in which the journalism industry is adjusting to fast-paced changes to its business model, driven in part by a decline in advertising revenue for print media.
“Since 2006, 70 percent of advertising revenue in the U.S. evaporated. It’s been an extremely turbulent time in journalism,” he said. “Basically every company in journalism has become a startup: a company in search of a scalable business model.”
By making use of machine learning—the science of getting computers to “learn” how to act without being programmed explicitly—data scientists try to measure and better understand the behavior of various users, Wiggins said. This allows the newspaper to uncover a “genome” of subscribers, he said, gleaning information about their future loyalty to the newspaper.
In addition to serving as the chief data scientist at The New York Times, Wiggins is an associate professor of applied mathematics at Columbia University.
Wiggins said that a good data scientist needs interpersonal skills because the ability to communicate ideas is crucial to getting any job done. Moreover, a data scientist should strive to build models that are “both predictive and interpretable” and constantly engage in critical thinking, he said.
Audience members said they found the lecture informative.
“It was interesting to learn how a print media company that has turned to an experiment in digital media wants to learn more about its users and how they can better serve them,” said Justin Ellis, a staff member at the Nieman Journalism Lab.
Swami Kumaresan, a professional who works in the startup industry, agreed.
“There’s this big gap between the business world and the academic world,” he said. “It’s interesting to listen to someone like him who has one foot in both worlds.”

UPDATED: November 4, 2014, at 3:00 p.m.
More than 500 revelers in colorful costumes and face paint gathered at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on Saturday to celebrate the Day of the Dead. The afternoon event featured traditional Mexican music and cuisine served by local restaurants.
The atmosphere at the Day of the Dead festivities was anything but macabre. As one of the most important holidays in Mexico, the two-day celebration commemorates the deceased, who are traditionally said to return to earth and visit their loved ones.
In line with centuries-old customs, the Peabody Museum was decorated with an offertory altar, skeletons, sugar skulls, and papel picado, or decorative paper craft.
J. Rodrigo Leal ’16 and Diego H. Huerta ’15 obtained tickets to the event through their class, Societies of the World 30: “Moctezuma’s Mexico: Then and Now.”
“We’re Mexican-American students, so this is a way that we get to take part in the festivities and celebrate here in Boston,” Leal said. He added that the decorations, including papel picado and calaveras—sugar molded to look like human skulls—were very similar to those of previous Day of the Dead events he had attended.
Like many others, Leal and Huerta had their faces painted.
“We learned in class that during Day of the Dead, by painting yourself as a sort of a calavera—a skeleton or a skull—you enter this liminal space between life and death, so we’re kind of representing the spirits that are participating in this event and becoming part of the atmosphere,” Leal said.
Tickets were required for entrance to the event.
Attendee Sandra Canas, who had attended the museum’s Day of the Dead celebration in the past, said she felt this year’s iteration was less lively than in previous years.
“It’s great that the museum does this. I’ve been coming for the past four years,” Canas said. “It used to be free. This place was so crowded that you couldn’t even walk. It was all you can eat and all you can drink…. I can see that it’s not the same.”
Mirna Orellana, another attendee, agreed. “It’s more slow and subdued,” she said.

In light of a recent Harvard Political Review op-ed criticizing the structure of the Institute of Politics and its definition of politics, more than 40 IOP-affiliated students gathered in the Winthrop House Tonkens Room on Friday to share reactions to the piece and ideas about the future of the institution.
Students who attended the event—which was moderated by IOP committee chair Jenny Choi ’16, who penned the HPR op-ed—expressed a range of views, with some advocating for a remodeling of the staff-student interaction at the IOP to give more weight to student input and others maintaining that the IOP’s structure should remain unchanged.
In the op-ed that sparked the event, Choi, also the current co-chair of the IOP’s Fellows and Study Groups committee, explained her decision not to run in the IOP student elections that begin Nov. 16.
“I write this article...in order to share the realization that’s helped me come to terms with why I no longer want to run: the IOP is not a student organization,” Choi wrote, citing limitations on student fundraising and the requirement that IOP staff must approve any “significant” ideas generated by student leaders at a student board retreat.
Procedures at the IOP such as a system of pre-approving line items on some subgroups’ budgets, she added, are “a symbol for the spirit of complacency that dominates the place.”
At Friday’s conversation, Inesha N. Premaratne ’16, a former chair of the IOP’s Women’s Initiative in Leadership program, said she disagreed with Choi. The level of involvement of IOP staff members does not directly interfere with students’ suggestions for changes within the organization, she said.
“I saw resistance to some ideas, but it was not from the staff,” Premaratne said, adding that the paid staff of the IOP help the institution run more efficiently.
“[The staff] pick up the ball when we drop it,” she said.
Ellen T. Robo ’16, a member of the Institute’s Harvard Public Opinion Project, cited the different timetables for student and staff members of the IOP as a potential source of tension.
“Across education institutions...students can be outlived by staff members. We’re only here for four years; we’re only really involved for two or three. It’s easy [for IOP staff] to outlive our time at college,” she said, adding that improved communication about the respective roles of student and staff members would benefit both sides.
In an interview after the forum, Choi said that despite the focus of the conversation on the relationship between staff and undergraduate leaders in the IOP, the focus of her op-ed was more directed toward “outsiders”—students at the College who are not involved with the IOP.
“I think the primary issue is how the IOP is defining what is politics and what is public service,” Choi said. “Maybe the underlying issue there is the student-staff dynamic, and maybe a tangible action item is working on that issue. But the umbrella goal, which might be hazy, is to really reflect on the way that we have set up politics and public service to be defined at Harvard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council leaders maintained a critical tone toward Harvard administrators in the weekly UC meeting Sunday, voicing frustration that Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has not yet scheduled a meeting with UC leadership to discuss student concerns.
Representatives also took a rare move at their meeting by striking down, in an overwhelming majority vote, legislation that would have automatically placed a referendum question on section size on this month's election ballot.
UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, largely reading from a prepared statement, explained to the Council that he has been in contact with Smith’s office for four weeks, but has been unable to arrange a meeting.
Mentioning the Council’s push for more funding and their continued criticism of a recent decision to remove difficulty ratings from the Q Guide, Mayopoulos said, “there is no good news on either of these topics.”
Mayopoulos, along with UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, alleged that Smith has delayed the pace of conversations regarding the UC’s budget as well as the Q Guide change.
“Students are part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. We deserve to meet with the Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In reality, this is the only way that we can move these issues forward,” Mayopoulos said after the meeting.
Goffard echoed a similar tone, saying that both University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana agreed to meet with the UC more quickly than Smith’s office.
“Maybe [Smith] does not see this as much of a priority as we do and maybe as, for example, Dean Khurana would,” Goffard said.
Smith was not available for comment by press time.
The Council also debated whether to automatically include a referendum question on the UC’s ballot that would have polled students on whether they endorsed capping discussion and lab section sizes to 12 students.
A referendum may be placed on the ballot in two ways—any student or group may gather 670 signatures or the Council may, by a two-thirds vote, automatically push the question to the ballot. Representatives agreed on the content of the question, but debated how it should be placed on the ballot.
UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 voiced his approval of the question’s placement on the ballot, but argued that the Harvard Teaching Campaign, a group of graduate students spearheading the initiative, should have to garner the requisite signatures.
“I think that they should have to prove that their question deserves to be on the ballot by garnering 670 signatures,” Biebelberg said.
Meanwhile, UC Education Committee Chair Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 argued that because the Council endorsed the section size cap last year and because the Teaching Campaign may not be well-equipped to gather undergraduate signatures, the Council should place the question on the ballot.
“It makes complete sense for the Undergraduate Council to propose this referendum,” Goyal said.
Nearly two-thirds of representatives voted against the measure, a relatively uncommon move for a Council that has typically tabled, rather than voted down, legislation.
Goyal said that he and other representatives will assist the Teaching Campaign in gathering signatures, but may bring legislation back to the Council next Sunday, depending on their progress.
The Council also voted in favor of placing a question concerning Q Guide difficulty ratings on the ballot, citing a lack of organized student activism on the matter.
Finally, representatives passed changes to legislation passed last semester mandating that House committees submit itemized budgets in order to receive Council funding. HoCos must now submit budgets once a semester and use a standardized format.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking through a cold drizzle on Saturday morning, Albert B. Corvah ’18 made his way down Cambridge St., knocking on doors and reminding residents to vote during his last weekend campaigning for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha M. Coakley.
Corvah, an intern for the Coakley campaign and a member of the Harvard College Democrats, was one of many students who spent the past few days on the campaign trail.
“Here in Cambridge it’s mainly Democrats, but not all of them are going to vote,” Corvah said. “So we have to squeeze those voters out as much as we can.”
As Tuesday’s elections approach, Harvard undergraduates have been campaigning for both major parties, braving cold weather and jaded voters. Though Harvard’s campus and the state of Massachusetts are traditionally liberal, College Democrats and Republicans said they believed their last-minute campaigning could have an important impact on election night outcomes.
With a full slate of events, including a trip to New Hampshire last weekend to campaign for Republicans, the Harvard Republican Club has had an active campaign season according to President Devi R. Nair ’16.
Nair said that her club has focused on areas of Massachusetts—including Salem, Billerica, Lynnfield, and Peabody—where the outcome of Tuesday’s election is “more of a tossup.”
“We’ve been trying to hit persuasion voters and independents, so those are districts that have kind of gone back and forth,” Nair said. “The initiative really falls on the younger generation to go out and make sure and see that that change is happening.”
According to Jacob R. Carrel ’16, vice president of the Harvard College Democrats, the group has tried to “support as many Democrats as we can.” To that end, the Democrats spent the weekend campaigning for Maine gubernatorial candidate Mike Michaud and phone banking for Coakley.
Both groups are optimistic about the prospects of their parties in the Massachusetts gubernatorial race.
For Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, campaigning for Republican gubernatorial candidate Charles D. Baker ’79 has been exciting, particularly in contrast to Republican campaigns in his home state of California.
“Being a Republican in California is a lot like being a fish out of water, there’s not a lot of effective campaigning to do,” Kansarinia said. “[Charlie Baker is] a model of a Republican candidate.”
Ross C. Svenson ’15, campaigns director for the Harvard College Democrats, argued that Coakley has grown on many voters with her record defending minorities, such LGBTQ individuals.
“I think people have seen, as the campaign has gone on and as they’ve heard more about her, how impressive she is,” he said.
However, he said he has noticed increased enthusiasm from Republicans on campus due to Baker’s lead in the polls.
“I think the Republicans are definitely a little giddier than normal,” Svenson said.
Massachusetts voters will go to the polls Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Education will move forward with a new training program for graduating seniors from the College interested in entering the teaching profession after receiving a $10 million gift supporting the initiative last week, Dean of the School of Education James E. Ryan wrote in an email to GSE faculty on Friday.
The Harvard Teachers Fellow Program, as the initiative will be called, aims to attract students who might otherwise pursue Teach for America and prepare them for a career in education. The first round of fellows will come from the Class of 2016, Ryan wrote in his email, which was provided to The Crimson by GSE senior lecturer Katherine K. Merseth, who is heavily involved in the program. The initial class will include about 40 College students.
The program was presented as a possibility to the faculty earlier this fall, but Ryan said then that it would not be launched until the school raised at least $10 million for the program. The gift, one of the largest gifts in the history of GSE, was provided by two anonymous Harvard graduates. Combined with another gift and support from University President Drew G. Faust, the program now has raised $14.5 million toward an ultimate total of $20 million, Ryan wrote in the email.
The new initiative is one of several other projects coming out of the GSE aimed at exposing undergraduates to the field of education, including an Education Studies secondary field and an Institute of Education modelled after the Institute of Politics, Merseth told Fifteen Minutes Magazine earlier this year. Both programs have yet to be publicly detailed.
The Teachers Fellow Program arose from efforts by Merseth and fellow GSD instructor Jon R. Star, as well as the GSE Teacher Education Committee.
Last year, more than 275 Harvard College seniors, or about one in five, applied for Teach For America, according to a brief on the program provided by Merseth. Teach For America, a nationwide program that recruits college graduates to teach in low-income communities for at least two years, has come under fire recently amid accusations that it undermines the public school system, among other complaints.
Merseth called the new program an alternative to TFA, of which she is a vocal critic. “We intend it to be this great way to get into teaching, but to do it right,” Merseth told Fifteen Minutes.
Harvard seniors interested in the program will apply in the fall semester and enroll in courses in the program that spring. Following graduation, the fellows will take additional courses and teach full time at the Cambridge-Harvard Summer Academy.
After the summer, GSE will arrange for each fellow to be placed in clusters at districts and charter schools, during which time they would receive further training from GSE.
Following their first year in the classroom, the fellows would take a second summer of course work, allowing them to finish a master’s degree and initial teacher licensure. During the next two years of teaching, the fellows would continue to receive training.
Ryan noted in his email to faculty that a formal announcement and press release would be issued in the coming days.

Surveyors are actively evaluating Lowell, Eliot, and Kirkland Houses to determine which of the neo-Georgian residence halls will follow Winthrop House in undergoing a complete renovation, likely to begin in 2017.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, Eliot and Kirkland, which share a kitchen, are being considered in tandem.
“While there have been no further decisions made, Lowell or Eliot/Kirkland are currently under consideration for the next project,” Cowenhoven wrote in an email. “Eliot/Kirkland will not be a single project, but their shared kitchen creates the need for close collaboration in planning and execution.”
Robert Sammonds, Lowell House’s building manager, said that several surveyors have been examining Lowell House since the summer. He also said that he has heard rumors that Lowell House will be next in the Renewal pipeline, but cautioned that those rumors are unconfirmed.
Eliot House Co-Master Gail A. O’Keefe likewise confirmed that “exploratory work” was done in her House this summer.
All three Houses under review were among the seven original residential Houses established at the College in the early 1930s. Eliot, Kirkland, and Lowell house roughly 439, 361, and 379 students, respectively, according to Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94. Those students will be displaced to various swing spaces during the Renewal process.
Adams House, which includes several separate residential buildings that date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, remains the only one of the seven original Houses not yet renovated or openly under review for renewal. University President Drew G. Faust said in February that House Renewal will concentrate on the River Houses before moving to the Quad.
Whichever House is ultimately selected will become the fifth project in the University’s more than $1 billion House Renewal effort. Quincy House’s Stone Hall and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall have already undergone renovation, while Dunster is currently being renovated.
There is a yearlong break in the renewal process scheduled to follow the completion of the Dunster renewal process next fall.
Cowenhoven added that, once Dunster House is fully renovated, “a strategic assessment of the three completed House Renewal projects will be conducted before the full renewal of Winthrop begins immediately following Commencement 2016.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After many months of construction, the puck finally dropped for the Harvard men’s ice hockey team at the newly renovated Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday night, as the squad kicked off its 2014-2015 campaign against Dartmouth.
Seeking to make some renovations of its own this season, the Crimson battled its way back from one-goal deficits on two separate occasions in the opener, skating to a 3-3 draw with the Big Green.
“It was a really good college hockey game,” Dartmouth coach Bob Gaudet said. ”[It was] really a good, fast-paced, hard, physical game for an opening game for both teams.”
Harvard (0-0-1, 0-0-1 ECAC) drew even with the Big Green (0-0-1, 0-0-1) for the final time with just over ten minutes remaining in regulation, courtesy of junior defenseman Patrick McNally.
Initiating the threat, McNally first ripped a shot from the blueline that knocked the stick out of the hands of diving Dartmouth winger Jack Barre.
In response, senior forward Tommy O’Regan quickly corralled the loose puck and sent it back to McNally. Taking advantage of Barre’s absence, the junior blasted his second opportunity past the glove of Big Green goalkeeper James Kruger to level the score.
McNally’s goal was his second of the game, as the defenseman also gave the Crimson its first lead at the 6:10 mark of the second period. Looking like the McNally who recorded six goals during his rookie campaign, the junior deftly made his way up the ice alone, eluded two Dartmouth skaters, and fired a wrist shot into the upper left corner of the net to put his side on top, 2-1.
“[McNally] is a game-changer,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “He’s at times our best forward, but he also seems to get back as well…. He enjoys being involved in the offense with the puck, and not only joining it but leading it.”
Dartmouth provided an answer just 1:27 later when alternate captain Eric Robinson ripped a shot past Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek off the draw. The Big Green would then add another with just over a minute remaining in the period, proving that Saturday was a great night to be a McNally.
Catching the Harvard defense napping, Dartmouth forward Brandon McNally weaved through defenders to join the Big Green attack before rocketing one home glove-side. The Saugus, Mass., native also had an assist in the game.
Last season, the Crimson split the season series with Dartmouth. In its one victory, however, Harvard lacked the services of then-freshman forward Alex Kerfoot, who sat out with a shoulder injury. Now entering his second season, Kerfoot said that he is finally healthy, which looked to be the case against the Big Green.
Following Dartmouth’s first goal 10:53 into the first period, the Crimson provided an immediate response after an attack from junior forward Jimmy Vesey produced a face-off in the zone.
Running a set play on the draw, junior captain Kyle Criscuolo smacked the puck in the direction of Vesey, whose shot was deflected into the air by Kruger. But after a failed clearance by Big Green defenseman River Rymsha, Kerfoot capitalized to put Harvard on the scoreboard.
“Kerfoot was tough to get a hold of out there,” Donato said. “He was quick and elusive and making plays. We’re excited [about] where we think that line [featuring Vesey and Criscuolo] can get to.”
Prior to its first goal of the season—coming just 14 seconds after Dartmouth’s—the Crimson had struggled to get anything going on the offensive end. Scrambling to solve the Big Green defense in the early stages of the contest, Harvard failed to register a shot on goal in the first 11 minutes.
“First game of the season, there’s always a [few] butterflies in everyone’s stomach,” Vesey said. “I think it took both teams a little bit to settle in tonight, but once you get the first couple shifts out of the way, it’s just another game.”
Once the Crimson put its first puck in the net, the offense found its rhythm. Harvard finished the contest with 37 shots on goal—a mark that the Crimson reached just twice last season.
“[This] is a group that is out to prove a point,” Donato said. “I think we have the potential to be an exciting team, and tonight was a good start.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four down, three to go.
In a battle of the two undefeated teams in the Ivy League, Harvard (7-0, 4-0 Ivy) came to Memorial Field and outlasted the Big Green (5-2, 3-1) in a defensive struggle to escape victorious, 23-12.
With the win in Hanover, N.H., the Crimson now holds sole possession of the top spot in the conference for the first time since 2011.
Crucial to Harvard’s success was its plus-two turnover margin. The Crimson’s defense forced four fumbles—recovering two—and picked off Dartmouth’s backup quarterback, Alex Park.
“On the season, believe it or not, we’re minus on the turnover margin, something that’s very rare for a Harvard team,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “That’s something we needed to turn around, and that’s something that was a key statistic for this game.”
Late in the first half, Dartmouth was down by a score and was looking to even the game when quarterback Dalyn Williams connected with wideout Victor Williams for a first down. But cornerback Chris Evans collided with Williams after the catch, popping the ball out, and senior defensive tackle Ryan Delisle fell on top of it to give Harvard possession deep in Big Green territory.
A few runs by junior running back Paul Stanton later, and the Crimson made the game a two-possession contest.
“You can’t make [mistakes] against a team like that,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “Three turnovers, one kind of late in the game, but the first one hurt us, put us in a real bad situation defensively…. That shakes you a little bit.”
A last-ditch Big Green comeback attempt whilst down nine points ended in a controversial turnover. A pass to receiver Bo Patterson put Dartmouth in the Harvard zone for the first time since its opening drive of the half, but when Patterson hit the turf, the ball popped out, and Harvard captain Norman Hayes emerged from the scuffle with it. After a lengthy discussion, the referees ruled it a turnover, much to Teevens’s dismay.
The Big Green would not put any more points on the board after its first drive of the second half, when it managed to tally a field goal, as the ensuing drive ended with a Park pick by junior cornerback Jordan Becerra.
The Crimson’s defensive front was dominant all game, limiting Dartmouth’s rushing attack to just 94 yards on 28 carries and pressuring both quarterbacks throughout the contest.
“Right now we’re playing a really special kind of defense, a defense we haven’t seen since probably the ’97 team,” Murphy said.
TROUBLE UNDER CENTER
After senior quarterback Conner Hempel was sidelined for the majority of the season thus far from a back injury, likely the last thing he wanted to do was watch junior playcaller Scott Hosch take his place in the most important game of the season to date for the Crimson.
But following a quarterback draw play late in the first quarter, Hempel got up and held his shoulder gingerly, and Hosch took over under center for the rest of the half. Other than the field goal that came after a turnover deep in Dartmouth territory, the stalled Crimson offense did not score again before halftime.
Hempel began warming up after halftime, and after the Crimson’s opening second half drive ended in a Hosch interception, the senior returned to finish the game.
“I asked [Hempel], about three times, eyeball-to-eyeball, ‘Are you sure you’re okay? We’re not going to put you in if you’re hurting,’” Murphy said. “I’m not saying that Conner Hempel wouldn’t fib to me, but as long as the doctors said he was fine and he said he was okay that made the decision easy.”
Though the Crimson only managed to tack on another field goal with Hempel’s return, the three points proved key, as the drive made the game a two-possession contest with six minutes left. Hempel’s longest pass came on this drive, when the senior found classmate Ty Hamblin near the sideline for 21 yards.
“[Hempel] just does a great job with his feet,” Teevens said. “He went out for a little bit, [and] I wish he took a little bit more time off. He’s the type of guy that gels an offense.”
Dartmouth had similar struggles when Williams had to leave the game with an eye injury. Park came in at the start of the fourth quarter and closed the game for the Big Green.
A STANT-UP GUY
With the uncertainty at quarterback, Stanton became key in helping the Crimson extend drives. Averaging 7.5 yards per carry, the junior certainly did that.
Stanton tallied 180 yards on the day, a career high for him. His previous record came last year against Dartmouth with 145 yards. Behind a stout offensive line that provided Hempel with time in the pocket and with typical red zone back Andrew Casten out with injury, Stanton also powered into the end zone twice.
“[Stanton is] powerful, he’s explosive, he’ll kind of stand behind those big guys…and he’ll exploit a hole really quickly,” Teevens said. “He’s really powerful. You’ll see him in a pile, and the pile moves, and you’ve got big guys falling off of him.”

Although the Harvard women’s rugby team fell short of its second consecutive Ivy League title, the squad did do enough to outperform its fourth-place seeding at the Ivy League Championships this weekend. After losing to Brown (8-0, 7-0 Ivy) in the semifinals on Saturday, the Crimson (4-4, 4-3) battled back to defeat Princeton (3-4) and earn a third-place finish.
HARVARD 22, PRINCETON 15
Crimson co-captain Kaleigh Henry broke out of a scrum inside the 10 and scored a try to break a 5-5 tie and give Harvard its first lead of the tournament. The Crimson never looked back, building a 22-10 lead over the Tigers in the first half and holding on to take the game, 22-15.
“We knew that we could take the things we didn’t bring out on the field during the Brown game and put all of our effort into this game,” co-captain Brooke Kantor said. “Princeton beat us before in the regular season, so to come out here and to demonstrate to them that we are the team with better skills and more teamwork I think sends a message.”
The Tigers jumped to an early 5-0 lead over Harvard with a try in the first three minutes of the game. But the Crimson responded with 17 unanswered points on the try by Henry and a pair of tries by sophomore inside center Claire Collins.
After Princeton responded with a try of its own, Harvard junior co-captain Hope Schwartz, who is also a Crimson sports editor, scored a try that gave the Crimson a 12-point lead going into halftime.
In Harvard’s regular season contest against Princeton, the Crimson surrendered 19 second-half points, which cost the team its lead and the game. In this one, Harvard held the Tigers to just one second-half try, and defended its 22-15 lead through the final whistle.
BROWN 27, HARVARD 5
The Crimson scored its only try in the final moments of the game to match the Bears’ second-half scoring total. But a 22-0 deficit in the first half doomed the Crimson and its chances of winning back-to-back championships.
“The team fought with more ferocity and courage than I’ve seen them fight all season long,” Harvard coach Sue Parker said. “We were just out-gunned by a team that was substantially bigger than we were.”
Although the Crimson set the pace for the first 10 minutes of the game, the team failed to score. At the 20-minute mark, a penalty called against Schwartz put the already size-disadvantaged Harvard at a player disadvantage as well.
Brown capitalized. Bears’ junior outside center Saskia Morgan used her speed to break the scoreless tie. A successful conversion by sophomore fly-half Sofia Rudin gave Brown a 7-0 advantage.
The Crimson also lost its regular season match with the Bears when it was outnumbered. After an injury late in the second half put Harvard at a player disadvantage, the Crimson surrendered two tries and the lead in the final 10 minutes of play.
Brown continued to dominate the rest of the first half. Senior prop Elisa Miles carried the ball downfield and set up junior wing Jasmine McAdams for a try. Within 10 minutes, the Bears pushed the scrum into the try zone to take a 17-0 lead.
In the final minutes of the first half, Brown struck again. Sophomore inside center Oksana Goretaya made a run and passed the ball to Morgan, who scored her second try of the day to give the Bears a decisive 22-0 lead going into halftime.
Morgan powered Brown’s offense, scoring three tries in the game. Morgan added another three tries in the Ivy Championship game to lead the Bears to a 42-5 victory over Dartmouth.
Morgan continued to cause problems for Harvard at the start of the second half, racing her way to her third try of the contest and the Bears’ largest lead of the afternoon, 27-0.
In the final drive of the game, the Crimson willed its way onto the scoreboard with a try by Collins, her first of three in the tournament.
“With the exception of the 20 minutes in the first half, 10 of which we were down a player, the game was completely even,” Parker said. “With the exception of those 20 minutes, it was absolutely our best performance of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The whistle blew in the Harvard-Dartmouth women’s soccer game and Big Green players immediately began jumping, embracing, and swarming in from the sidelines. It looked like Dartmouth had just won the Ivy League Championship. They hadn't.
But they had ended the Crimson’s unbeaten Ivy streak, which stretched back to the last time Harvard traveled to Hanover, N.H., to face the Big Green. The Crimson fell by the same score on that day in 2012, 2-0.
Despite the loss, Harvard (9-4-2, 4-1-1 Ivy) still clings to a one-point lead over Dartmouth (7-4-4, 3-0-3 Ivy) in the Ivy League standings. The Crimson return home next weekend for its final contest against fourth-place Columbia with its second consecutive Ivy title on the line.
“We were aware of how long it had been since we’d lost an Ivy League game and...it put a lot of unnecessary pressure on us,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “Rather than being disappointed about the loss, we’re trying to take this as a positive and a weight off our shoulders. It’s good for us to have this experience behind us.”
Harvard showed offensive momentum early in the game, taking three shots in the first 16 minutes.
But the Big Green struck first. Crimson senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba charged out of the net to interrupt Dartmouth’s drive, but junior forward Corey Delaney got an extra touch on the ball and maneuvered around Emba to set up an open-net goal and a 1-0 lead for the Big Green.
“In these Ivy League games, you are always trying to get that first one because it changes the complexion of the game and what the other team has to do,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “So scoring first, they were able to get a lot of numbers behind the ball, and it made it more difficult for us to get through them.”
The Crimson was in position for an equalizer six minutes later. A series of crisp passes and a strong cross into the box set up senior defender Erika Garcia, but her shot sailed just over the crossbar.
With less than fifteen minutes left in the half, Harvard and Dartmouth exchanged a pair of shots and saves.
Although the Crimson outshot the Big Green, 7-4, in the first half, Dartmouth put all four of its shots on goal, while Harvard managed just two on target.
The Big Green came out fighting in the second half. After squandering an opportunity with a loose ball in the box on its first drive of the half, Dartmouth maintained its offensive pressure. Less than five minutes into the half, Delaney sped past the Crimson defense and powered a shot to the far right post outside of Emba’s reach to score her second goal of the game.
With just over 18 minutes left in the half, Delaney took a shot identical to to her second goal. But this time, a diving Emba managed to get her outstretched fingertips on it and deflect it out of bounds.
Although Harvard remained within striking distance and started playing with a sense of urgency down the stretch, the Crimson could not find the back of the net. Harvard struggled to keep its shots on target, and the Big Green’s senior goalkeeper Tatiana Saunders, a first team All-Ivy selection in 2013, easily handled the three Crimson shots on net.
Dartmouth’s defense has dominated the Ivy League, surrendering just three goals in conference play this season.
Part of that defensive success has resulted from the Big Green’s aggressive style of play. Dartmouth fouled Harvard nine times in the game, while the Crimson did not foul once.
“I think the number of fouls often reflect a teams’ defending tendencies,” Margolius said. “We were solid in our individual defending all over the field so we never needed to foul them. We also put them under a lot of stress in the final third of the field, forcing them to foul us in dangerous areas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­The reigning Ivy League Player of the Year continues to amass the preseason hardware.
On Friday, senior wing Wesley Saunders was named among the top 50 players in the nation by ESPN’s new #CBBrank. The article polled 35 ESPN experts from across various platforms to get a one through 10 ranking of the top players in college basketball. Players are ranked according to their mean score.
Saunders clocked in at No. 46 with a mean score of 6.88, fractions of a point ahead of Kaleb “Zeus” Tarczewski, the Arizona center who demolished the Crimson front line two years ago in the teams’ third-round NCAA Tournament matchup.
“He’s our best player,” senior center Kenyatta Smith said Wednesday. “He has to be someone that comes with his energy every night and is ready to put the team on his back when need be.”
Saunders led the team in scoring last year with 14.2 points a game, adding 4.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists a contest while routinely guarding the opposing team’s best player.
The article described Saunders as “one of those guys who always looks sleepy at tipoff” but that “once he gets going … Saunders can hurt you anywhere inside the arc.”
“He’s our best player, but he’s an under control guy,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He needs to be our hardest worker, [and] we have given him that role. When he does that, he’s different, and we’re different.”
Amaker went on to note that depending on how things shake out, Saunders is in the conversation to be one of the better players to ever play at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The clock was winding down, with less than two minutes remaining in the game. The Harvard men’s water polo team had possession with an extra-man advantage in a tie game. Co-captain Max Murphy received a cross pass from junior attacker Blake Lee, fired a shot before the shot clock ran out, and got the ball past St. Francis goalie Aleksandar Gavric.
Murphy’s first goal of the game gave his team the late and narrow lead that would allow the Crimson to take the game to overtime.
Though the team would ultimately fall to St. Francis, Harvard (19-7, 7-4 CWPA) had many more scoring moments like these during their conference games in New York against St. Francis, Fordham, and Iona, taking two of three.
“We played with heart and hustle for each and every minute of all three games, never giving up easy goals and executing our offensive game-plan with confidence and poise,” Murphy said.
HARVARD 11, FORDHAM 7
The Crimson bounced back from its loss against St. Francis to defeat Fordham (13-15, 4-8), 11-7. The team brought its defensive skills to the Bronx, where it snapped the Rams’ two-game winning streak on Sunday.
Harvard dominated the entire game, scoring most of its goals in the first half. Lee led the offense with five goals, four of which occurred in a span of less than 20 minutes. Freshman utility Colin Chiapello added three goals in the final minutes of the game to secure the win.
“I am proud of this team, and especially our younger players, for stepping up in the face of adversity,” said Murphy. “We have been mired with injuries for the entire season...but even with few substitutes we were able to achieve success.”
HARVARD 11, IONA 9
The Crimson rounded off its regular season with an 11-9 win against Iona (6-16, 5-7). Both teams entered the game coming off a win, and it was a close contest from the start.
Lee again had a productive first half, contributing three goals that kept Harvard in the game as the two teams traded leads constantly. The half ended with each team scoring six goals apiece.
Defense played a bigger role going into the third quarter, with both teams scoring only two goals each. Murphy stepped up once again in the final minutes of his last regular season game for the Crimson, leading his team to a win.
“We've been pretty focused on the defensive end, and I was happy to see it pay off,” junior goalie Colin Woolway said. “We really wanted to win that game since the game at Iona was our only regular season loss last year, and it was nice to avenge that loss.”
ST. FRANCIS 19, HARVARD 16
The Crimson fell to the Terriers (11-9, 9-1) by a score of 19-16 on Saturday in Brooklyn. The first game of the team’s road trip was an evenly matched one, with both teams’ defense playing important roles. St. Francis took an early lead—scoring 4 and conceding only 2 goals in the first eight minutes—and held on to the advantage for the first half of the game.
Lee and sophomore 2-meter defender Dan Stevens led the attack in the third quarter, giving Harvard its first lead of the game, which it was able to maintain going into the fourth quarter.
Late in the fourth quarter, Murphy put the Crimson up by one, but a foul resulting in a man advantage for its opponent allowed the Terriers to tie the game and send it into overtime.
Harvard took the early lead in overtime, but was unable to answer four goals put up by St. Francis.
Following the two wins, the team looks next to the CWPA Northern Championship at MIT on November 8 and the CWPA Eastern Championship on November 21.
“We will be seeing some of the same conference rivals we've been playing all year,” added Murphy.” “We know how to beat each team and we know that we can. Our focus for the next few weeks will be to maintain intensity for every defensive possession and to stay healthy.”

Heads up, Harvard students: the fall semester is rapidly coming to a close. You’ve probably noticed some of the warning signs: the chill in the air, the changing leaves, the harried look on your classmate’s faces, the faint odor of your roommate after he or she has spent three straight days in Lamont…
But instead of freaking out about your midterms, take a second think about what the nine-week mark signifies.
For Freshman:
You’ve been in college for nine weeks. Nine weeks. You’re like... a real college student now. It’s about time you start looking ahead to Thanksgiving break, when you can show off all your new college student knowledge to your friends back home. You have to make sure everyone knows you’re a partier now! The mid-semester mark should remind you to enjoy freshman year. When else will you have unlimited access to Annenberg and such close proximity to most of your classes? You’re already a quarter of the way through the year!
For Sophomores:
In case you hadn’t heard, November 12th is the deadline for you to pick your concentration. No pressure or anything, but that means you only have two and a half weeks to figure out your passion/life path. Not only that, but being halfway through this semester means you’re almost halfway through the year, which means you’re almost halfway done with college...so many life decisions! So little time!
For Juniors:
Middle of the fall semester means only one thing: it’s almost almost time to start applying to summer internships! If you really want a leg up on the competition, you’d better start padding your resume now. Just think of how great you’ll feel telling your friends/relatives/random strangers about all the finance and consulting internships you have lined up. Remember, the overeager, uber-competitive bird always gets the worm—especially when the “worm” is unpaid.
For Seniors:
You will officially be done as a Harvard student in about 6 months. That statement probably fills you with overwhelming joy or overwhelming sadness, or some weird mix of the two. Either way, embrace it and enjoy your last few months as a college student. Continue sleeping through your gen ed sections (“mandatory” section is for freshman and pre-meds, obviously) and celebrating Thirsty Any-Night-of-the-Week. You do you, Class of 2015.

Good morning, Harvard! It’s Monday, the greatest day of the week! It’s the day when we all lament how little work we accomplished this past weekend to dance in ridiculous costumes alongside other people in equally ridiculous costumes. Here are some things we did instead of doing our homework/papers/studying for midterms/all other academic obligations:
1) Party (obviously): Just tell yourself going out three times this weekend was acceptable because it was Halloweekend and we got to feel as if we’re like every other school (jk they go out every night).
2) Meticulously analyze pictures of ourselves from this weekend: Maybe you spent 30 minutes editing a picture to make it your prof pic, only to realize you’re saving it until it’s a good time to rack in those Facebook likes (social media validation, what up).
3) Ask everyone what they were for Halloween/share with everyone what you were for Halloween: Let’s be real, it’s going to be one of these listed here: bunny, cat, sailor, hippie, or some obscure reference only you yourself will appreciate.
IN THE ATMOSPHEREAfter the monstrosity that was yesterday's weather, today is going to be significantly better! There will be a high of 57 degrees and a zero percent chance of precipitation (tbt to the snow…#toosoon?).
IN THE D-HALLS
Lunch:Chicken Breast with Tomato Basil SalsaPork Sausage Sub with Peppers and OnionsLentil Chili with Corn
Dinner:Coconut Curry ChickenMultigrain Penne with Basil Pesto and ShrimpTofu, Broccoli and Walnut Stir Fry
ON FLYBY1) Name Sleuthing 101: Clever ways to finding out someone’s name, including stalking them at Starbucks either when they’re ordering their drink or when the barista calls out their decaf soy double-cupped half-syrup chai latte.
2) Reality Check: Penn Newspaper Initiates #beatharvard Campaign: Dear Daily Pennsylvanian, how dare you try to answer “Why is Penn better than Harvard?”
3) Your Dorm Room is Terrifying: Things scarier than those scary movies you binged on during Halloween weekend, such as laundry (omg).
IN THE NEWS1) Days Before Election, Students Brave Snow and Hit the Trail: "Walking through a cold drizzle on Saturday morning, Albert B. Corvah ’18 made his way down Cambridge St., knocking on doors and reminding residents to vote during his last weekend campaigning for Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Martha M. Coakley."
2) Ed School To Launch Teacher Fellows Program for College Seniors: "The Graduate School of Education will move forward with a new training program for graduating seniors from the College interested in entering the teaching profession after receiving a $10 million gift supporting the initiative last week, Dean of the School of Education James E. Ryan wrote in an email to GSE faculty on Friday."
3) UC Voices Frustration at Smith, Nixes Automatic Section Size Question: "Undergraduate Council leaders maintained a critical tone toward Harvard administrators in the weekly UC meeting Sunday, voicing frustration that Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith has not yet scheduled a meeting with UC leadership to discuss student concerns."
4) Following Op-Ed, Town Hall Focuses on IOP Structure: “In light of a recent Harvard Political Review op-ed criticizing the structure of the Institute of Politics and its definition of politics, more than 40 IOP-affiliated students gathered in the Winthrop House Tonkens Room on Friday to share reactions to the piece and ideas about the future of the institution.”

Nothing complements the fall spirit and curbs cravings for the sweet, nourishing comfort of home quite like food. If you, however, are living on a budget, juggling a heavy course load, and/or a danger to yourself and others in the kitchen (aka: a college student), it can seem like there is an insurmountable barrier between you and autumnal, edible bliss. So put down that HUDS blondie brownie (although we can’t guarantee fewer calories) and try these super fast, super affordable recipes that you would have to be a Yale student to mess up:
Candy Apples: Simple, classic, elegant. First, head to the closest dining hall and figure out how many apples you can steal in one fell swoop. It doesn’t even matter if you end up using them all. The important thing here is not how many you need, but rather how many you can get on your person at one time. This is also the most challenging step, seeing as pretty much all you do after that is dunk the contraband fruit in melted caramel and eat it off a stick awkwardly while trying not to make eye contact with anyone. To increase the difficulty level, steal some sprinkles (only feature at select dining halls), double points if you can do so without putting them in any sort of tupperware or bag, and throw them on there too.
S’mores Nachos: Smores? Good! Nachos? Bueno! S’mores Nachos? Amazing! While not the most alluring presentation-wise, these multicultural masterpieces step up the kitchen game because you may need more than just a microwave (if that exceeds your abilities, it’ll probably taste the same if you just put it in the microwave instead of a skillet anyway. Also, please seek some supervision before utilizing any appliances, and while you’re at it, also ask that person to teach you how to tie your shoes). Gather your typical s’more ingredients, layer them however you please, and just heat the crap out of them until it forms a gooey mess. Science: sloppiness varies proportionally to deliciousness.
Pumpkin Spice Mousse: This wouldn't be a fall recipe list without some pumpkin spice. All you have to do is sit your yoga pant-clad butt on your rightful throne of Basic Land, mix together some whipped cream cheese (cinnamon brown sugar flavored is best), normal whipped cream, and pumpkin pie filling. To be honest, though, unless you are just too committed to the basic life to make your own decisions, chocolate mousse is a thousand times better.
Candy Corn Bark: Do you have that one friend who always shames you while you enjoy a dessert by saying things like, “oh, it’s just so sweet” or “it’s too rich for me,” subsequently forcing you to pretend you weren’t going to each much more of it? If so, do not let that person anywhere near this treat. The basic premise here is to take sugar in the form of cookies (oreos), cover them in more sugar (melted white chocolate), and then top it off with the most embarrassingly sugary thing ever invented (candy corn). This saccharine abomination may seem uncalled for, but it’s a sure fire way to transport you back to your childhood, or at least to induce a sugar high worthy of making you run around until you vomit, just like you did when you were six years old.
