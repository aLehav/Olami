After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:
We appreciate The Crimson’s coverage of conflict-of-interest policy at Harvard Medical School. As the dialogue on this important topic continues, we hope that discussions will focus on the need for broad, structural change in academic medicine, not specific physicians. We regret that some articles—in particular the November 14, 2008, piece, “Harvard Medical School Students Push to Codify Conflict of Interest Polices”—have placed unwarranted emphasis on individuals as opposed to the systemic issue at hand. In this letter, we wish to clarify Dr. Paul Richardson’s role in our course as described by The Crimson and also the process that led to the implementation of a formal HMS policy requiring faculty disclosure of conflicts of interest. 
As mentioned by The Crimson, first-year medical students have weekly “clinics” during which physicians present patients to provide clinical context to basic science. During one such clinic, Dr. Julian Adams—the lead developer of the drug bortezomib—described the drug’s scientific discovery and clinical development. Dr. Richardson then interviewed a patient who was being successfully treated with bortezomib-based therapy, providing a very human perspective to the presentation. The discussion of the patient’s experience with both the disease and treatment was inspirational and relevant to our course material. 
Very importantly, Dr. Richardson broke no HMS policy during his presentation. There was no existing policy mandating disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, and there is absolutely no indication that he supports anything but transparency. In no way do we question Dr. Richardson’s character or his commitment to his patients or to us as students. The context of the presentation simply made students aware that no formal conflict-of-interest disclosure policy existed.
Following the clinic session, students worked with our course director and dean of medical education to create formal rules on lecturer disclosure. The following week, the HMS Curriculum Committee created new policies requiring lecturers to disclose conflicts of interest when they are relevant to the lecture material. This process demonstrates how collaboration between faculty, students, and administration can lead to swift institutional changes.
The quotations from David Tian and Shamsher Samra (HMS ’12) in The Crimson’s coverage were taken out of context. We want to be clear that they were not meant to describe our otherwise very positive interactions with Dr. Richardson and faculty members during the creation of the lecturer disclosure policy. Rather, these quotes described the challenges of advocating for policy changes on conflict of interest beyond the lecture disclosure policy, a topic that also has no bearing on Dr. Richardson.
As The Crimson recently noted, HMS has announced the formation of a committee to update its conflict-of-interest policies. We believe that such an approach correctly focuses on system-wide issues and not on individual doctors. We look forward to working with this committee to bring our institutional policies in line with those of our peer institutions and with the recommendations of the Association of American Medical Colleges.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:

We are deeply troubled by the administration’s recently announced decision not to offer January term programming and to require students who wish to remain in Harvard housing to submit an application demonstrating a “need to be on campus.” Foremost, we’re concerned that requiring students to justify their presence on campus will subject students to real hardship. It will be easy enough for athletes, international students, and thesis writers to present their cases; it will be considerably harder for students who have no readily identifiable reason to be on campus, but very real reasons not to be home. Many students will relish the chance to hang out at home for a month, but others are not so lucky. Some students come from troubled homes; others are estranged from parents and relatives. And others have simply agreed with their families that going to college means leaving home for good. It’s unrealistic to expect all students in such circumstances to be able to come up with jobs and places to live for three weeks in the middle of January. Is there a provision in the new system to accommodate those who can’t? If so, will such students be required to list the details of their personal lives on an application to demonstrate their need? How will they even know to apply? 
On a personal level, we’re also worried by Dean Hammonds’s refusal to say whether some Houses will be closed over January. Asking students and tutors who remain on campus to relocate for a month involves a slew of complicated adjustments. Will students in the Houses to remain open be required to pack up and store their belongings before winter break to enable J-term students to move in? Will tutors —the vast majority of whom live at Harvard year-round, with school and work commitments that require them to remain at Harvard during January—also be required to relocate? 
At other schools, J-terms are successful because they give students the chance to pursue on-campus experiences that depart from their normal academic routines. Such opportunities free students to explore different interests and to get to know different sides of their college community. As proposed, Harvard’s J-term will do precisely the opposite. By restricting student access to housing for three weeks in January, Harvard may save money, but it will exact a high cost by disrupting students’ lives and diminishing their college experiences. We urge the administration to reconsider its plan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the new administration took office, Republicans have been seemingly bereft of ideas for fixing the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi may not have been as nurturing of bipartisanship as some would have wanted in finalizing the stimulus bill in the House, but the final product included enough tax breaks to warrant support from a significant portion of the Republican caucus. That only three Republicans between the House and Senate voted in favor of the bill only made them seem like obstructionists in the eyes of the American people. 
And the futile House vote orchestrated by Minority Leader John Boehner to institute a spending freeze was one of the least constructive routes the Republicans could have chosen, exasperating even a ranking, albeit independent-minded member of the conservative commentariat. This episode only illustrated how, lacking leadership and a clear direction, the Grand Old Party remains wedded to “principles” with no practical application to the crisis we’re in, a parade of political stunts accompanied by the hyperpartisan pronouncements of Rush Limbaugh and that curious crew holding forth on Fox News. 
But wait. Hold the presses. One of those political stunts might actually have merit. “Merit” as in public policy merit, but merit also because it presents a political opportunity for Obama. There’s an idea being circulated by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum, and even gracing the airwaves of “El Rushbo,” that could be the first truly bipartisan achievement of the Obama era: a payroll-tax holiday. Some proponents suggest a year or two (more like a payroll-tax sabbatical), but, at a cost of $100 billion per month, we’re probably talking more in the nature of one of those European holidays—i.e., a month or two. 
Payroll taxes are the roughly 15 percent that gets taken out of each paycheck to cover the costs of entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and, depending on the state, unemployment and disability insurance. The employee pays roughly half of that 15 percent, and employers cover the rest. The payroll tax is regressive in that there is a ceiling on how much of your income gets taxed. In 2009, payroll taxes will only be levied on the first $106,800 earned, meaning that a millionaire will pay a far smaller percentage of income in payroll taxes than someone who earns $40,000. As it concerns Social Security, this is premised on the notion that you’re paying into your own personal account, not funding the benefits of those less or more fortunate than yourself. 
The deeply regressive nature of payroll-taxes has prompted one commentator on the left to propose something far more dramatic than even a payroll-tax sabbatical. Hendrik Hertzberg in The New Yorker has suggested scratching the payroll tax altogether and instead levying a tax on carbon to fund Social Security and Medicare. We would be eliminating a tax on something we wish to encourage, job creation, thereby giving the fruits of their labor to lower-  and middle-class workers, while taxing pollution, which we want to discourage. (It should be noted that such a proposal has zero prospects for being considered in the short term, as it completely upends the fundamental premises of the current entitlement system, but perhaps as we get further down the line with entitlement spending and more comfortable with the idea of a means-tested system, it might get a more serious look.) 
Paul Krugman, the devil’s advocate on the left, tells us that we need more stimulus. Now is exactly the time when we should want to suspend regressive taxes and put money back in the hands of low- and middle-income families to spur household consumption. While economists can argue about the relative effectiveness of government spending as opposed to tax cuts in stimulating the economy (Krugman would presumably find a reason not to like this idea), who can deny that there would be a positive jolt to consumer spending from something as dramatic as a complete suspension of payroll taxes, even for a relatively short period of time? The February stimulus bill contains something along these lines, the Making Work Pay tax credit, which will mail out a refundable tax credit of up to $400 in both 2009 and 2010. But an actual hiatus on payroll taxes would mean bigger paychecks in the much shorter term.
And the politics would work pretty well, also. Because it solely benefits workers making $106,800 or less, it should be a no-brainer for congressional Democrats. Yet Obama could very conspicuously present it as a Republican idea. Would the Republicans run from it on the pretext that we are now too covered in red ink for it to be “fiscally responsible”? Or will they pose for those smiling photographs with Obama that will do little for their own political standing and make Obama seem even more above the partisan fray? Either way, Obama will emerge in a politically stronger position.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Harvard students are so well trained to question their established modes of thinking, here’s something to chew on. Although we may spend more hours per day studying at Lamont than sleeping, books can’t teach us everything. Reading, writing, and struggling through problem sets help us to think critically, but they’re not enough—students need more than just texts to analyze or numbers to crunch.
That’s where study-abroad programs come in. Study-abroad programs provide precisely the practical applications and new environments a completely bookish education lacks; in terms of personal development, the gains are immeasurable. And, yet, Harvard’s record in this area is sadly lacking—an ironic fact given its supposed commitment to preparing students for a multicultural world. Now more than ever, Harvard must do more to publicize study-abroad options and remove academic hurdles in order to encourage more of its students to study overseas.
Studying abroad, be it in Paris or Paraguay, provides students with invaluable tools in this increasingly global world. In most cases, it enhances language skills; in all cases, it enables contact with alternative opinions and worldviews, allowing one to understand from the outside how other countries view our own. These factors allow a student to see America, Harvard, and his or her own life in a new way.
Unfortunately, in comparison to that of other schools, the number of Harvard students who study abroad is abysmally low. Though Harvard’s statistics have improved over the past few years, we still have a long way to go to catch up with other academic institutions. 
As of 2007, Harvard was sending fewer than 15 percent of its students abroad. In comparison, Dartmouth sends the most students abroad during the academic year, with 39 percent of its student population going overseas. Brown comes in second with a 35 percent study-abroad rate, and UPenn gets third place with 30 percent. If prizes were awarded, Harvard would barely get a participation sticker, let alone a place on the medal podium.
That’s a shame, especially since actively encouraging study abroad doesn’t take an institutional revamp. Many of the resources are already in place at Harvard, through institutions like the Office of International Programs, but are simply underpublicized. 
These offices should emphasize more actively the importance of semester or yearlong study-abroad programs by organizing talks, publicizing pertinent information and deadlines, and working closely with departments. Students who have been abroad already should be invited more frequently to speak to others about their experiences and how those experiences have allowed them to appreciate and take advantage of all that Harvard has to offer at home.
Academically, red tape also prevents many students who might otherwise test-drive an international experience from ever even considering study abroad. Harvard should strip away these administrative roadblocks and make academic requirements more flexible so that students have more freedom to leave. 
Currently, it is difficult within any concentration for students to go away during the school year—History and Literature and Social Studies students who go abroad during the spring semester, for instance, are required to write their junior papers while also doing study-abroad coursework in other countries. Students planning to study abroad must take the initiative to track down all of their academic advisors, develop a course of study that precludes courses that do not count for Harvard credit, and constantly check the Office of International Programs website for updated deadlines, as dates are not well advertised. If the process were streamlined and encouraged as an enriching part of the academic experience itself, more students might be inclined to venture outside of New England.
Harvard prides itself on the opportunities it provides its students, and that should include the chance to go and learn in any part of the world. While there is much to be said for academic rigor, the challenges of living in a new place, learning new languages, and seeing the world in a new light pushes students to learn and grow outside of the classroom. At the end of the day, there is more to an education than combing through dusty tomes. Indeed, to widen our horizons, we may have to look beyond Widener—beyond even Harvard—to the rich, fascinating world outside of our gates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Did you know that factory chicken farms—they keep the chickens calm by making them wear red contact lenses?” I muttered, pushing my salad around the plate. Here I was, face to face with an eminent professor of the English language, and I found myself missing Gchat. Gchat would give me time to Google his reference to some Florentine poet I’d never heard of. It would even allow me to take a break from talking to watch “David after Dentist.” But, now, trapped in the actual world where remarks were not merely lines of text to be answered or ignored at will, I stared helplessly into my salad, hoping some form of witty discourse would manifest itself on the kale with cranberry dressing. Somewhere faintly behind me I heard the Lowell bells tolling the death knell of the art of conversation. 
People have been complaining about the demise of conversation at Harvard for decades. In 1935, Professor Andre Morize offered an explanation for why conversation wasn’t as good as it used to be: “People go to teas, and stand up all through them. You can’t talk well standing up.” Somehow, the problem seems more real now.
Increasingly, talking is something people do when other things are going on. Our generation doesn’t converse—we comment. We hand down our authoritative pronouncements through means of communication that don’t require us to defend our positions. No one has debates on Twitter. YouTube is covered in comments that would be better expressed—and better spelled—via a simple thumbs-up or down. Face-to-face conversation, too, has slipped more and more into commentary. People talk to pass the time, share information, and entertain each other. 
On the surface, this seems fine. After all, this is the heyday of the chronic oversharer. Everyone talks all the time, regardless of whether anyone listens. We Tweet, we Facebook, we Gchat, we blog, we text. We share every thought, significant or un, from the moment we switch on our iPhones in the morning to the instant we sit down face to face with an actual person. The difference between face-to-face conversation and any other medium of communication is simple: No distractions are permitted. Fran Lebowitz once remarked that “the opposite of talking isn’t listening. The opposite of talking is waiting.” Given our intense generational ADD, this has become something of a hurdle. Unlike actual conversation, texts, Gchats, Tweets, wallposts, and e-mails are things you can simply wander off and ignore with total impunity. Our generation likes that. We don’t want to be trapped listening to you explain fiscal policy when we could be watching a video of a cat running into a wall.
Yet the ability to leave these “conversations” whenever we want has another, more sinister dimension. Whenever someone disagrees with that intelligent comment we posted on Huffington Post, we can simply browse away. The idea of persuasive speech, conversation with a point to it that advances one viewpoint over another, is increasingly remote. No one argues anymore, or, if they do, it’s about things like who deserves to pick up that peanut on the common-room floor. The upshot of modern communication methods is that you get to choose whom you talk to, and people tend to pick only those who agree with them. 
In previous eras, an ability to defend your opinions in conversation was essential to your intellectual survival. Now, discussion tends to sound something like this comment I found on an online forum: “THAT WHAT’S WRONG WITH KIDS THESE DAYS.THEY SEE ALL THIS SEX ON T.V AND LEARN FROM IT.IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE SEX ON EVERY CHANNEL.EVEN CARTOONS ARE SEX AND FOUL LANGUAGE.KIDS ON CARTOONS ARE TAKING OFF THERE CLOTHES. WE TELL ARE KIDS NOT TO DO SOMETHING.BUT WHEN THEY WATCH T.V. THEY SAY HOW COME ON T.V THEIR DOING.” As we become adults and move into the world, this prospect becomes frightening. 
Allowing us to escape the duty of keeping the conversational ball rolling in the face of contention, the Internet and new communication technologies have had the paradoxical effect of allowing us to connect with millions of people—who all share our opinions. We want more of the same. Instead of risking blind dates with friends of friends, we find mates online who match our interests and values. Netflix suggests movies for us like those that we’ve already seen. Pandora constructs radio stations for us out of music we already know we will like. Farewell difference! People who try to engage in debate on online forums are branded as trolls and dismissed. More often than not, this is merited. But trolls and non-trolls alike suffer from the lack of discussion. As our conversation becomes more and more purposeless and self-referential and less and less about persuasion and fleshing out ideas through dialogue, we risk losing depth of thought for good. If we want to escape this dire fate, one thing is clear: We need to talk.

Anyone visiting Prague, Warsaw, or Budapest in recent weeks would have found beautiful old cities in a rather depressed mood. Despite the arrival of spring, the political and economic news across the region is gloomy at best. Eastern Europe’s emerging economies have been some of the worst hit by the current economic crisis—making unemployment rise, threatening their ability to roll over foreign debt, and toppling governments. As a recent International Monetary Fund paper proposes, the best way forward may be a European answer to an Eastern European problem: early adoption of the euro. 
Of course, not all Eastern European economies are the same. If we consider the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary, it becomes clear that the last has taken much more debt from foreign markets—in a way that may have been problematic even without a global economic crisis. But, in the current scenario, investors that had previously been attracted to the generous interest rates of the region have fled as fast as possible. And very few remain, making it very hard for these countries to roll over debt or put in place counter-cyclical measures to ease the effects of the global crisis. In a way, it has been like the Tequila Effect in Mexico or the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s, in which confidence crises presented potentially catastrophic problems without a clear way out for governments that did not command trust from international markets. 
Ultimately, as the G20 recognized, the largest irony is that the countries worst hit by the current crisis are not the places in which it originated. But, across Eastern Europe, few people have time to be ponder such facts. The Polish zloty has lost a third of its value against the euro in just a few months, but that has not made its exports more competitive, since they have plunged along with global economic trade. The Czech Republic, arguably one of the most respectable governments in the region, has seen its prime minister resign right in the middle of its European Union presidency—what was a time to shine internationally has become a time for embarrassment as the Parliament looks for a new coalition leader. 
And, yet, when it comes to chaotic situations, Hungary has seen the worst: The stark depreciation of the florint in international markets means that over half of the mortgages in the country (denominated in euros, just like everything aimed to tourists in Budapest) have become unpayable. Macroeconomically, the state has faced a similar constraint: Therefore, the World Bank, the EU, and—most notably—the IMF have agreed to provide funding to avoid disaster. On Thursday, it was announced the country would receive over $25 billion of international bailout funds to last through the year. As David Hechlam, a director of the rating agency Fitch, commented: “They could probably get access to the markets, but the price they would have to pay would be very high”—given the situation, prohibitively high.
This is where the euro should come in. Europe’s currency is a true financial miracle—when it was created just over a decade ago, everyone thought it would fail. Milton Friedman famously predicted it would be a disaster, and the Bank of England had stress scenarios that foresaw a similar end to the monetary experiment. Yet, over ten years later and despite the fact that it was created with a political rather than economic agenda, the currency remains alive and arguably very strong. As with most things in life, adopting it involves a trade-off. A country gives up monetary freedom (to devalue, for instance) in exchange for increased trade with the rest of Europe, coordinated monetary policy, and a confidence seal in terms of foreign indebtedness. Basically, through the European Central Bank, countries less reputable than Germany get access to German interest-rate levels in regular market conditions.
The Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland are all scheduled to go ahead with a rather long process of monetary convergence in order to join the euro, overseen by the ECB. But, as it turns out, the current crisis renders impossible many of the conditions implicit in the plan, particularly when it comes to fiscal balance (which everyone is throwing by the wayside) and indebtedness (which has been a problem for a long time in the region). The problem is significant because, if things continue deteriorating, it may pull the region farther and farther away from Europe, in a way that could hurt these countries in the long run. And given the many problems they are now facing, the trade-off inherent in the adoption of the euro makes a lot of sense.
The key, as in most monetary matters, is long-term credibility. But for Europe, it is also about honoring standing promises. After all, the EU was part of the “value proposition” offered by the West after the communist grip on the region collapsed. It has arguably brought strengthened institutions, representative democracy, and better respect for human rights. Even though these countries may not be technically ready for the euro just yet, the ECB should push for its adoption in order to further integrate nations like Hungary and Poland. Only Europe can deliver them from a potentially catastrophic confidence crisis that would set them back years, if not decades.

The arts seemed to be enjoying a great year at Harvard. Last November, President Drew G. Faust announced the formation of a Task Force on the Arts that issued a report calling on Harvard to make the arts a more “integral part of the cognitive life of the University.” Among its recommendations were proposals for increasing the presence of arts practice in the curriculum and increasing student access to arts-practice courses. A quick glance at the studio art course offerings of the VES department underscores the serious need for such changes. But, with the imminent departure of Nancy Mitchnick, one of only two painting instructors in the department, the university appears to be moving in the wrong direction.Undergraduates already have a dismayingly small number of studio art courses to choose from, even fewer of which focus specifically on painting. Moreover, studio courses are generally limited to 12 students, and, given the limited number of courses, priority must be given to VES concentrators. This situation makes it very difficult for non-VES concentrators to have the experience of taking a studio art course during their time at Harvard. Both VES concentrators who pursue serious work in visual art and non-VES concentrators who desire to take an art class simply for enjoyment purposes find themselves with a dearth of options.Yet, instead of expanding painting offerings in the curriculum, Harvard is allowing beloved painting instructor Mitchnick to depart as soon as her visiting lecturer contract expires. In a recent Crimson article on the future of the VES painting program, both VES concentrators and department members expressed concern that this development marks a trend of the department’s shifting emphasis in a conceptual direction—essentially moving from art practice to art theory.Such a shift away from technical skills education is troubling given that practicing art is integral to thinking about art.A comprehensive education in any field is supposed to give students the tools to explore issues that interest them in their subject of choice. Just about every concentration requires students to master certain basic skills, whether it is through tutorials, survey courses, prerequisites, or something similar, in order to move on to more advanced and often more conceptual material. Painting courses such as Mitchnick’s provide that kind of base for students who want to concentrate in art. In keeping with the Task Force on the Arts’s recommendations, Harvard should take care to reaffirm its commitment to strengthening rather than weakening the quality and breadth of arts-practice programs in its current effort to improve art education at the university.

Sushi grade octopus will no longer be a T ride away come May 10, when the Japanese grocer Kotobukiya will be forced out of its lease in Porter Square, according to the store’s assistant manager.
The grocer sells a variety of authentic Japanese food items, cookware, and magazines in the Porter Square Exchange Mall, part of Lesley University. The space is shared by a variety of small Asian eateries, such as Cafe Mami, Sapporo Ramen, and Tampopo.
Its last day will be May 10, according to assistant manager Hideki Hiromoto.
Hirimoto said Kotobukiya had been fighting for a 5-year lease, but Lesley’s last offer had been for two years, said Lesley spokesperson Bill E. Doncaster.
After several lease extensions of four to five months, Lesley decided it would not renew the grocery’s lease in order to make space for its cramped bookstore, according to Kotobukiya manager Nori Ikegami.
“It was a little too sudden. [For the] last two years, [Lesley] gave us four months, five months, and all of a sudden, it was cut off,” Hiromoto said. “It was shocking.”
Cambridge’s other Japanese market, Yoshinoya in Central Square, closed in 2007. While other Asian groceries in the city still sell Japanese products, none carry Japanese food exclusively.
Doncaster said that Lesley is negotiating a stronger lease for Blue Fin and Kotobukiya Sushi Bar, both Japanese restaurants in the Porter Square Exchange Mall with the same owners as Kotobukiya.
An employee at Kotobukiya is planning on opening another Japanese grocery in Medford with a different name, according to Hiromoto.
Several fellow Porter Square Exchange Mall store owners expressed concern that the grocery’s closing would hurt their own business.
“It’s going to very inconvenient for us,” said Sapporo Ramen employee Ori Tanaka. “We’re probably going to lose customers. Many people go to Kotobukiya to shop and [then] dine in here.”
Yasu Itoh, owner of Japanese restaurant Tampopo and a long time friend of Kotobukiya’s owner, echoed Tanaka’s concern. But he said he had five years left on his lease and so was not concerned for his restaurant’s security.
Kaoru Takasaki ’10, president of the Harvard Japan Society, said the store has supplied not only familiar snacks but also the ingredients for the society’s sushi and dessert making workshops.
“A lot of the ingredients for [our workshops] can only be found in Japanese grocery stores,” she said. “It’ll make things more difficult for us as an organization...It’s very disappointing.”

Visiting professor Jonathan N. Lipman ’69 spoke to a room of 30 students last night in the Lowell Junior Common Room about the striking diversity of Islam in China, as part of the ongoing Eighteenth Annual Islam Awareness Week. Organized by the Harvard Islamic Society (HIS), the week consists of five days of events—from April 6 to April 10­—that aim to inform the Harvard community about the practices, beliefs, and cultures of Muslims on campus.According to HIS president Na’eel A. Cajee ’10, the annual Islam Awareness Week seeks to raise awareness among the student body not only about specific beliefs and practices associated with Islam but also about the multiculturalism to be found among Islamic peoples.“They say that the religion itself can be likened to a clear river,” Cajee said. “When it flows over China, it looks Chinese; when it flows over Africa, it looks African.”Lipman’s talk, titled “Spotlight on: Chinese Muslims” and jointly organized with the Chinese Students Association, stressed similar points. He described the diversity of Chinese Muslims, who vary from practicing Turkic-speaking Uyghurs in the west to non-practicing Chinese-speaking descendents of Muslims in the east.“I wanted to mess with [audience members’] minds,” he said in an interview after the event. “The idea that ‘Muslim’ and ‘Chinese’ are whole homogenous black-box categories—that you are either Chinese or Muslim—is just not reality.” Lipman, also a history professor at Mount Holyoke, said he was careful to distinguish culture, ethnicity, and religion in his speech. Different aspects of a person’s identity can be reconciled in many different ways, he added.“You carry your ethnicity on your ID card,” he said. “You carry your religion in your heart.” Lipman also touched on the politics of Islam in China. He mentioned that the government’s statistical categorization of Muslims could reductively split the Muslim population into forced groups, an effect harmful to the ummah—or sacred sense of unity—of the Islamic community there. He also said that the translation of Islamic concepts into Chinese, a language with no monotheistic verbiage, poses a particular challenge.Several students, who did not attend the speech, said they felt well-informed about Islam already and found Harvard to be a religiously tolerant environment. Similarly, Professor David G. Mitten, faculty advisor to HIS, said that Harvard students and administration have upheld an actively sympathetic relationship with the Islamic community.“I don’t know of any cases where individuals have been victims of prejudice or discrimination,” he said.But he added that this does not make the awareness week unnecessary, as he credited it with helping improve the relationship.

Twenty-four juniors have been elected to Alpha Iota of Massachusetts, Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa.The undergraduate honor society, whose stated goal is to encourage “scholarship, friendship, and cultural interests,” admits students based on factors such as the variety of their course loads and the depth of their intellectual endeavors. The application process includes submitting two letters of recommendation, which the society recommends be written by faculty members at the University.The inducted students said that they were very pleased with their prestigious achievement.“I’m extremely honored, and at the same time humbled. I feel extremely lucky and blessed,” said Andrew Q. Le ’10. He added that he takes a broad course load because he is both an economics concentrator and a pre-medical student.Stephanie H. Lo ’10 said that she partly attributed her election to her natural inclination to test her own academic limits.“If you’re passionate about the classes that you enroll in and you’re willing to challenge yourself, Phi Beta Kappa may naturally follow,” Lo said. She added that the election committee may have been impressed by the multi-faceted academic interests reflected by her course load, which includes economics, biology, and high-level mathematics classes.Jeffrey D. Nanney ’10 said that he credited his achievement in large part to his teachers.“I really attribute a lot of it to having conscientious professors who really went out of their way for me,” he said. “You don’t even turn in your resume, so the balance falls a lot on them.”Vikram R. Modi ’10, an applied mathematics concentrator, said that while he is very pleased to join the honor society, PBK should not be viewed as an end goal.“I don’t see it as something to work towards,” Modi said. “I see it as a reflection of what you would have done anyway.”The twenty-four students inductees into Phi Beta Kappa are Zachary R. Abel, Zachary C. Arnold, Jeremy N. Aron-Dine, Daniel M. Bear, Malcolm G. Campbell, Brian S. Chen, Timothy H. Hsieh, Wenna Jia, Eric T. Lander, Andrew Q. Le, Christopher T. Lim, Stephanie H. Lo, Mary Anne Marks, Vikram R. Modi, Colin J. Motley, Jeffrey D. Nanney, Hamida B. Owusu, Palmer Rampell, Anthony C. Speare, Dennis L. Sun, Yi Sun, Julia Ye, Chelsea Y. Zhang, and John C. Zhou.

In response to an announcement from Harvard deans this week outlining plans for next year’s “January Term,” the Undergraduate Council’s Student Affairs Committee voted on Tuesday to recommend a policy paper advocating greater student access to January housing.
The policy paper—co-sponsored by UC president Andrea R. Flores ’10—recommends that students spending at least 20 hours a week on “structured, scheduled activity” be eligible for campus housing during the period.
Monday’s announcement stated that there would be no academic programming for the January period and that housing would be limited to students who could demonstrate a “need to be on campus.”
Council leadership received the finalized January decision by e-mail less than an hour before the student body did, giving the UC essentially no time to respond, according to a Council member who requested that their name not be used to preserve their relationships on and off the Council.
The UC’s policy paper, which was in the works prior to the announcement, will now serve as the Council’s effort to influence policy and potentially as its official position on the issue.
With the major budget cuts and freezes at Harvard, few students said they were surprised that the College would not want to spend more money on January programming. But some students said they had hoped the administration would allow students to stay on campus over break to participate in activities organized by student groups, such as the Institute of Politics. 
If housing is provided during January “students will plan things—just as we plan great things in term time,” said Mary K. B. Cox ’10, president of the IOP’s Student Advisory Committee.
But Monday’s announcement cast doubt on that possibility. 
College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an e-mail to the student body, “[F]rom January 10 through January 22, only students with a recognized and pre-approved need to be on campus will be permitted to return to college housing.” 
The e-mail further stated that, “Students who need to be on campus may potentially include varsity athletes, international students, thesis writers, students conducting lab-based research, and others who cannot reasonably accomplish their work in another location.”
But the e-mail left uncertain how “need” will be assessed, and defining the standard is one of the main tasks of the UC’s policy paper.
“We recommend that the College’s philosophy in housing students during January 2010 not be focused on if students absolutely need to be on campus, but rather on if students will benefit from being on campus for a certain activity,” the paper stated. The document will be submitted to a vote of the entire Council on Sunday, 
Jon T. Staff ’10, the UC’s former SAC chair, said that considering the outcome, the Council was “probably not proactive enough” in the decision-making process for the J-term. 
Tamar Holoshitz ’10, the current SAC chair, defended the UC and said it was difficult for the Council to make substantive suggestions without knowledge of the University’s budget.
Administrators had shown “quite a bit of ambiguity,” she said, because they had not heard from the Finance office what would be possible for J-term when they initially spoke with UC representatives.
Both Holoshitz and Flores said they did not fault the UC or the deans for communication problems, which they said were more systemic in nature.
“There should have been more of a formal structure put in place to research ideas and feasibility for next year’s J-term,” Holoshitz said.
Transparency of the decision-making process would have facilitated UC involvement, Flores said.
“The problem is more of the system than either the decision makers or the UC,” she added.

A former Harvard Medical School professor has been disciplined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for falsifying as much as half of the data he used for a Harvard study on sleep apnea in morbidly obese patients.
As part of a voluntary settlement agreement with Health and Human Services, Robert B. Fogel will not be allowed to serve the U.S. Public Health Service in any advisory capacity for three years. All research affiliated with Fogel funded through the Public Health Service during this period will be subject to supervision.
The fabricated data was published in the journal SLEEP in 2003. That publication retracted the article last week, citing a notification from the HMS Dean for Faculty and Research Integrity stating that data in the article was fabricated and falsified. The other co-authors of the tainted study were not involved in the fabrication, according to the journal’s retraction.
Fogel was the former co-director of the Fellowship in Sleep Medicine at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and a former associate professor of medicine at the Medical School, according to the Federal Register’s log of the case.
The ruling on Fogel’s guilt was precipitated by his initial oral admission to his mentor, clinical professor of medicine David P. White, in the fall of 2006.
White said that before the project was completed, Fogel went to work for the pharmaceutical giant, Merck. During that time, White said he tried to get Fogel to write up his findings from the study for a year, but the information was not forthcoming. Finally, White said, Fogel called him to say that he had fabricated some of the data in the study.White realized that some of Fogel’s data had been published in an earlier cross-sectional study published in the journal SLEEP, and Fogel confirmed that the fabricated research was included in the published report.After that, White said, there was a massive investigation to make sure that other data produced by Fogel had not been fabricated.Fogel falsified data so that it would “better conform to his hypothesis,” according to the Register, which was released April 2. He also fabricated approximately 20 percent of the “anatomic data that were supposedly obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) images” in the study.White said that though he is not entirely sure what drove Fogel to fabricate data, he suspects that he felt pressured by the imperative to publish.“He wanted the data to come out to meet the hypothesis,” White said. “It wasn’t coming out that way, so he made it come out that way.”White said that an investigation on the infraction at Harvard moved glacially, taking two to three years.“It’s very sad that it happened and it does cause a lot of consternation and anguish,” White said. “I hope I never have to deal with it again.”Kevin C. Myron, a spokesperson for Brigham and Women’s Hospital, wrote in an e-mailed statement that Fogel left the hospital in 2004, and the hospital supports the investigation’s findings.David J. Cameron, a Medical School spokesman, declined to comment on the investigation.—Staff writer Laura G. Mirviss can be reached at lmirviss@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard Business School has begun reevaluating its practices after drawing fire for the high-profile role its graduates have played in an unprecedented financial crisis that some allege stemmed from recklessness or negligence.
The case study—being written by a task force formed in November by HBS Dean Jay O. Light to research the implications of the financial crisis for HBS—will analyze the School’s performance in preparing students during the lead up to the financial crisis.
HBS Deputy Dean for Academic Affairs W. Carl Kester said that the case aims to examine every facet of life and education at the school.
“There will be a certain amount of what we’re doing well or not well,” Kester said. “It will really be something that cuts across our lives here.”
The faculty will use the case findings to discuss implications for curriculum and methods of attracting students at a faculty meeting next month, according to Paul M. Healy, an HBS professor and co-chair of the task force. 
Healy declined to comment on the task force’s findings so far, saying that the case is unfinished.
Kester said that the school has used cases to analyze its performance in the past and that it has a culture of reexamining itself.
“If you were a fly on the wall in one of our meetings, you might not think you were at one of the world’s best business schools because we’re always asking ‘What’s wrong?’” he said.
Media critics have increasingly pointed to Harvard Business School—the alma mater of former Merrill Lynch chief executive John A. Thain, recently ousted General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner, and Bush administration Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox—as the source of the irresponsible activity that bred the crisis.  
Last month, Philip D. Broughton, a HBS alumnus, wrote an article for London’s Sunday Times entitled “Harvard’s masters of the apocalypse.” Harvard Business Review has published several blog posts on this issue, including one titled, “Are MBAs the Problem?”
In 2001, the Business School reworked its curriculum after the Enron scandal to include a required, full-credit course on corporate accountability. According to Kester, current students also frequently debate ethical dilemmas in other classes.
“The people who are being criticized graduated between 20 and 30 years ago,” Kester said.
Students said they generally agreed that they are being adequately prepared for the challenges of the business world, said Patrick S. Chun ’04, co-president-elect of the HBS Student Association. He said he believed the problem was marketing.
“Maybe HBS hasn’t been as proactive as it could be in casting the vision of the MBA as a modern need for businesspeople,” Chun said. “We need to show what we’re learning from this experience.”

A former Ghanaian presidential candidate criticized African leadership for contributing to the problems ravaging the continent at an intimate talk on African political change and its challenges at the Kennedy School last night.
Papa Kwesi Nduom, the 2008 presidential candidate for Ghana’s Convention People’s Party and the closest challenger to the representatives from Ghana’s two entrenched political parties, sent a series of pointed messages about political reform to an audience of about 20 that included many African students.
“It is appropriate that we recognize that we Africans have been made poor by bad leadership, across the continent,” Nduom said. 
“And not because we have not known what needs to be done,” he added. “Africa has no good reason to be the poorest of continents in this world.”
Nduom is the latest in a series of guest speakers invited to the Harvard Kennedy School as part of the University’s “Africa Week”—seven days of events jointly coordinated by African student associations at the College, Law School, Kennedy School, Business School, and the School of Education.
Nduom’s experience in Ghanaian politics was “very relevant” to many African students studying away from their home countries, said Julia M. Mensah, who identified herself as a Kennedy School student serving as co-chair of the Africa Caucus there.
“A lot of people want to go back and create some kind of change,” said Mensah, a Ghanaian native, adding that she was curious how Nduom’s message could be adapted to garner as much popularity with Ghanaian citizens at home as abroad. 
After a brief history of Ghana’s political system following the country’s liberation from Britain in 1951, Nduom discussed the difficulties of campaigning in Ghana’s latest elections. Challenges ranged from lack of funding, to the questionable tactics of opposing parties, to the poverty endemic in many Ghanaian regions, he said.
“It is difficult to pay attention to a [political] message when you’re hungry,” Nduom said. He proceeded to detail how the poverty in certain areas changed the way he campaigned there, forcing him to put campaign money towards feeding supporters, transporting them to and from rallies, and producing and giving away T-shirts.
Audience members were enthusiastic about Nduom’s appraisal of Ghanaian leadership and the country’s need for political reform.
“I had not followed Ghanian politics, [but] I found it refreshing,” said Kennedy School alum Serah Makka. “I’m so excited by him. He seems crisp and clear in his thinking.”

Friday’s announcement that The Boston Globe will be shut down in early May if unions don’t agree to cost-cutting measures hasn’t fazed many members of the Harvard community. Talk about the shutdown began after executives at The New York Times Co.—The Globe’s parent company—threatened to close the Boston newspaper if The Globe’s unions did not agree to a decrease in pay and the end of company contributions to pensions, which would total $20 million.The announcement comes as newspapers across the country have announced cutbacks, buyout programs, and closures in response to plummeting print advertising revenue.But many students said they did not think they would be affected if The Globe were shuttered.“I don’t read The Boston Globe at all,” said Tara Tai ’10. “If I read the news, it’s online, and it’s from The New York Times or CNN.”“I think it would be sad,” said Alexandra N. Alves ’11, “but I don’t think it would affect me personally.”Other students said they do rely on The Globe for their daily news.Benjamin L. Brinkopf ’11 toured The Boston Globe facilities as part of the Through The Gates program freshman year. Now, he says he gets his news through The Wall Street Journal, CNN, and The Globe.But Harvard students, many of whom hail from outside the Boston area, largely expressed apathy at the prospect of losing the paper. Anthony C. Speare ’10 said he reads The Salt Lake Tribune when at home in Utah but doesn’t read The Globe.“I don’t identify with Boston in any sense,” he said.Several Cambridge residents affiliated with Harvard also said the newspaper’s passing would affect them little.Maria I. Paiva, a HUDS employee who lives in Somerville, said that while she sympathizes with the workers whose jobs are on the line, The Globe is not on her daily reading list. Workers at local newsstands and convenience stores said they would not expect a large impact on sales were The Globe to close. Radwan Kheireddine of C’est Bon Convenience said he expects any loss in business to be temporary.“In the beginning, we’ll hurt a little bit,” he said. “But we’ll adjust.”

In many Harvard classes, students benefit from the chance to drop a dismal midterm or wayward problem set. Unfortunately for Crimson baseball, there is no such provision for a single devastating inning. Harvard (7-20, 5-3 Ivy League) allowed six runs in the second against Bryant University (24-9) in an 8-2 defeat yesterday during an otherwise even contest in Smithfield, R.I.The Crimson could not muster much of an offensive charge against Bulldogs senior starter Dan Lozeau, who strung together an effective 5.2 innings, yielding two earned runs on seven hits.“We had a few opportunities that we didn’t capitalize on,” captain Harry Douglas said. “We didn’t take advantage of a couple times when we had runners in scoring position,”Sophomore Dillon O’Neill had the best day at the plate for Harvard, going 3-for-4 after replacing sophomore Sam Franklin in center field. Sophomore catcher Tyler Albright also collected a pair of hits. But the main threat for the Crimson in the mid-week tuneup proved to be senior slugger Tom Stack-Babich, who continued to torment opposing pitching with a solo shot to right field in the sixth.The Harvard bats were silent early, however, as the visitors found themselves in a big hole. Bryant tagged freshman starter Will Keuper with six runs on eight hits in the second frame, including three doubles. The lefty avoided walking any Bulldog batter, but simply suffered a hit parade at the hands of a talented lineup that has bested prominent programs such as Virginia Tech and Boston College.Bryant senior Pat McKenna and junior Nick Campbell led the way for the Bulldogs with two RBIs each with three and four hits, respectively.Although Keuper struggled early on, the squad recovered due to stellar bullpen work from young Crimson arms. Freshman Conner Hulse posted the best outing of the day, after relieving Keuper to finish the second. The hurler Harvard coach Joe Walsh has called “a bulldog” worked 2.1 scoreless innings, allowing only two hits while striking out three and walking none.“Today was the first time I really felt comfortable on the mound all year,” Hulse said. “I felt like I had all of my stuff, so I was pretty excited about [my effort].”Hulse’s teammates also took note of the performance, as Douglas praised the rookie’s ability to mix pitches.“Conner’s a good pitcher, so whenever he’s in the game we’re feeling pretty confident,” Douglas said. “He was throwing strikes and his breaking stuff was really good today, in addition to the fastball.”Freshmen Jonah Klees and Marcus Way, along with sophomore Dan Berardo, also saw time on the mound for Harvard, as the visitors held a potent Bryant offense to only two runs for the remainder of the contest.With the Bulldogs bats in check, the Crimson began to show life in the fifth inning. Junior first baseman Dan Zailskas opened the frame with a base hit, followed by O’Neill and senior second baseman Taylor Meehan loading the bases with singles.With the sacks filled and no outs, Harvard looked to cut into the 6-0 deficit, but an untimely double play halted the rally. Although the Crimson plated Zailskas, it would earn only one more run in the contest, courtesy of Stack-Babich’s longball.“We definitely should have put up a lot more runs,” Hulse said. “Recently we’ve hit the ball really well, but right at [opposing] fielders.”Without its typical run support, Harvard could not take advantage of a few quality showings on the mound. In addition to Hulse, Berardo continued to look strong with a third consecutive scoreless outing—this time allowing two harmless hits over an inning of work. The Crimson will look for the sophomore to put together a longer stretch of shutout ball as a starter.The southpaw Klees also threw effectively over two innings—limiting Bryant to just a run while fanning three batters—but Harvard knows that such efforts will prove more important during a four-game weekend slate against Yale.The Crimson hosts its Ivy League foe for consecutive double headers on Saturday and Sunday—significant games in the tight Rolfe Division.“We’re looking forward to [the matchup],” Douglas said. “Obviously there’s a rivalry there and it’s always competitive. We just want to come out hard this weekend.”—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any international athlete who arrives at Harvard knows that there are a lot of changes to deal with. There’s the distance from home, new foods, a new academic environment, and for some, fellow classmates who say, “O.M.G. I love your accent!”But for freshman tennis star and proud Aussie Holly Cao, the No. 4 singles player on the Crimson women’s tennis team, the biggest challenge came in the form of white fluff.“I mean I’ve never seen snow before I came [to Harvard],” Cao explained. “I’m from Sydney, and it’s always warm, always sunny. I came here and I see all of this snow, all of this rain, all of this, this weather.”Despite the weather, Cao has been taking Harvard by storm, winning her fourth consecutive match in the No. 4 singles spot last Saturday when the team beat Cornell in Ithaca, N.Y. Cao, along with the other freshmen on the team, has provided depth and sparked the Crimson to a much-improved 9-7 overall and 2-0 Ivy record this season.“Holly is really a warm, caring, and fun, easy-going young woman,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “She’s a great student as well as a super fierce competitor.” After starting tennis at the age of six, when she first realized that she was “quite good at it,” Cao rose in the Australian junior ranks, becoming the No. 1 junior Australian player in 2006. One of Cao’s crowning moments came that same year, when she played for the third time at the junior Australian Open at Melborune Park and raised her ranking to No. 699 in the world. “That was really awesome because I played for three years straight at Melbourne Park,” Cao said. “We were playing the second week and we would have meals where all the professionals ate, and we saw them on a daily basis. Crowds were cheering us, it was really cool.”At Harvard, Cao has continued this success with a record of 10-3 overall this year. In her 10 victories, Cao has taken down some big names including the Big Red’s former No. 1/No. 2 singles player, Sinziana Chis. Cao also won her 16-person flight in the William and Mary Invitational Tournament in September.“I’m a pretty calm player,” Cao remarked. “I don’t let my emotions overpower me. I tend to think logistically on the court, but I like to hit a lot of winners.”Despite this success, Cao’s freshman year has hardly been easy, with the weather turning out to be the least of her problems.The biggest hurdle Cao faced was overcoming a fractured kneecap from a biking accident and an injured wrist that kept her out for the majority of last semester. “I’m all better now,” Cao said with a hint of relief. “It’s good to be back on the court. I’m trying to improve with each match I play.” Add her injuries to the fact that over 10,000 miles separate her from warm Sydney and her family that she has yet to see this year, and it’s surprising that Cao seems to manage everything so well. “I think she’s overcome a lot of adversity and she’s done a really great job,” sophomore Sam Rosekrans said last Saturday. “I feel like it was hard for all of the freshmen the first couple of weeks of school, to adjust to a new environment,” Green said. “It was probably particularly hard for Holly to come from Australia, but as the weeks went on and the months went on she started getting more comfortable with life in the U.S.”Yet being so far from home has helped Cao find a new family in her teammates, a welcome experience after being a singles player all her life.“For all junior tennis players it’s a very individual sport—it’s a very selfish sport. You just want yourself to win and you don’t care about any other,” Cao said. “But here in college it’s more of a team sport. We want the others on the team to do just as well as we do. That’s the biggest transition going from an individual mindset to wanting the whole team to do really well.”Cao has learned how to deal with being an international athlete at Harvard with the help of captain Laura Peterzan and freshman Louise Laciny, who both come from England“We come from all parts of the world and different states in the U.S.,” Cao said. “They’ve been very helpful, because it’s hard when you are so far away from home.”With the help of her teammates, Cao has refused to let any obstacle get the better of her, and has continued to show the success that prompted Tennis Australia to call her “one of Australia’s best young players.” But Cao is not focused on this praise. Instead, she is just focusing on this weekend, when the Crimson takes on Princeton. “I am so excited, because I think it’s going to be a tough match, a long match, but we are prepared,” Cao said excitedly. “We’ve been working really hard for the Ivy League season. Hopefully, we will come away with the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring has officially begun, at least in my book. It happened a day late this year, in the moment that first Josh Beckett fastball hit the leather of Jason Varitek’s glove. And yes, I was that girl in section not-so-discreetly refreshing Gameday.
My name is Kate, and I’m a Red Sox-aholic. 
The period from October to April is a dark one for us Bostonians, especially when Tom Brady busts his knee in the first quarter of the season. But this year, between glowering at Mark Teixeira and religiously following the blogs from spring training, I finally found an appropriate distraction.
It involves a smaller diamond, a big yellow ball, and some underhand pitching. Yes, covering the Harvard softball team has become my antidote to the Pre-BoSox Blues.
Everybody knew the Crimson would be good this season. Returning eight of nine position starters from a team that made it to the Ivy League Championship Series will give you a little bit of preseason notoriety. 
But the funny thing is, it’s not the veterans who have powered the team to a solid 19-9 record and second place in the Ivy League North entering divisional play this weekend. 
What’s most exciting about Harvard’s squad is the incredible performance of rookie hurler Rachel Brown. 
Brown hasn’t just plugged the hole the Crimson had in the circle this season after the departure of ace Shelly Madick ’08. More than halfway through the season, she’s carrying the team, and is well on her way to one of the finest rookie seasons Harvard has seen in recent history—in any sport.
From day one, Brown has pitched like the seasoned ace of the staff, to the tune of a 1.22 ERA and an 11-3 record with three saves, 11 complete games, and 146 strikeouts in 97.2 innings pitched. 
This past weekend, in a crucial pair of Ancient Eight doubleheaders, Brown pitched an astounding 20.1 out of the team’s 28 innings, nabbing two saves and two tough-luck losses.


Her one concession after Sunday’s set? “Yeah, I’m pretty dead right now.”
Brown takes control of the game like few Ivy League pitchers can, mainly because of her impressive ability to induce strikeouts. Just 17 appearances into her Crimson career, she already ranks seventh in career strikeouts and 10th in career saves. 
Most remarkable? Once she reaches the 100-inning minimum to get on the career list, she will be first in Harvard history with 10.46 strikeouts/7 innings pitched—nearly three strikeouts ahead of current leader Chelsea Thoke ’01. If Brown keeps up this pace, she could finish her career with close to 1000 strikeouts, which would absolutely shatter Thoke’s record of 557.
If the season ended today, Brown would rank first in the single-season record books in opponent batting average (.173), walks allowed/7 innings pitched (0.26), and strikeouts/7 innings pitched, as well as second in ERA. In short, she’s well on her way to arguably the greatest season ever produced by a Crimson pitcher. 
And she’s just getting started.
Unsurprisingly, she’s already been honored twice as Ivy League Pitcher of the Week and twice as Rookie of the Week. She also made the League Honor Roll in the one week she didn’t take home an award.  
Compare this performance to that of Harvard’s recent female Ivy Rookies of the Year and it’s clear just how notable Brown’s season has been.
Soccer’s Melanie Baskind, volleyball’s Anne Carroll Ingersoll, and basketball’s Brogan Berry were all honored by the league for their performances this year.
Each turned in an impressive rookie season, but none of the three could definitively claim to be the best player on her team. And only Berry was asked to take on even close to the same role of controlling the game that Brown faces every time she steps into the circle. 
One missed pitch can cost you the game in softball, particularly when you don’t have the bats working behind you—a position Brown has found herself in all too often this year.
In her four Ivy League starts, the Crimson has scored just four runs, three of them coming against Penn. 
Last weekend against Cornell and Princeton, Harvard didn’t score a single run in either of Brown’s starts, saddling her with a pair of losses despite the fact that she allowed just four runs in two complete games (while striking out 17). 
If the Crimson plans to make a run at the Ivy Championship, it’s going to have to step up its offensive production and find a little bit more consistency at the plate.
With Yale coming to town this weekend for the beginning of Ivy League North divisional play, Harvard’s bats need to get hot—and soon. 
Veteran leadership was touted as the strength of this edition of the Crimson, and it’s time for those old pros to step up and start giving Brown the run support her performance deserves. She’s already proved she can pitch under pressure, but wouldn’t it be nice to let her have a little fun on the mound?
This weekend, my beloved Red Sox are making the trip to Los Angeles to take on the Angels. And while I’ll still undoubtedly pull up Gameday every night, by day I’ll be making the trek to a different diamond, anxious to see just how far a rookie ace can take her team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In virtually all sports, a shutout is an unsettling term. Most talented, winning teams aren’t on the losing end when this word is being uttered in game recaps. 
Harvard softball (19-10, 5-3 Ivy) got a wake-up call in Green Line territory on Thursday afternoon, losing in a shutout to Boston University (25-11). Not including yesterday, the Crimson has been shut out in its last five losses.
Although shutouts normally delineate a severely unbalanced game or ailing team, not only is Harvard having a good season, but they also have a winning record on the road (9-5). The problem yesterday evening was not the Terriers’ pitching—while pitcher Kelley Engman pitched an impressive full seven innings with only four hits, it was no Cy Young performance, as she had just two strikeouts.
“Offense, that’s our main focus,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “[Engman] was effective on the mound, but I think we could have hit the ball better.”
Harvard had just four hits in 25 at bats in the game, but ball contact is not reflected in hit statistics. In many cases, players would connect with the ball, but only produce an easy out inside the diamond. Meanwhile, BU was able to produce three runs with just one more hit than the Crimson, totaling five for the game.
In order to explain the pestering “0” in their loss column this season, Harvard players have looked inward. They believe that their offense was simply out of tune against the Terriers, and that this problem can be easily rectified.
“We’re hitting shots, we’re just hitting them right at people,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We just need to relax a little bit more in the box.”
“We needed to make adjustments and go with an aggressive mentality earlier in the game,” Allard said.
For any tardy fan who showed up at the top of the 6th inning yesterday, the game had no sign of a likely victor. Neither the scoreboard nor the stat sheet had much convincing evidence. BU had scored the game’s only run up to that point in the third inning, and both teams executed well defensively and on the mound. Neither the Terriers nor the Crimson were busting any stitches from the plate.
“We pitched well enough to win, we just have to give them some offense,” Vertovez said. “We’re all pressing really hard on ourselves. We need to do it with the bats.”
Harvard has given up five runs or less in each of its last sixteen games, and they’ve scored five runs or more in each of its last five wins. The Crimson defeated BU in both of their matchups last season. Needless to say, there is no curse, no losing streak, and no fundamental troubles with putting the bat on the ball. Without an identifiable, chronic difficulty, offensive problems seem to be inexplicable.  
“We’re in an offensive slump, and we need to pull ourselves out,” Allard said. “We’ve been changing up the lineup, doing more drills in practice, attacking and trying to improve. Working on our confidence.”
BU pulled further ahead late in the game by adding runs to its slim lead. After the Terriers scored twice in the sixth inning, giving them a 3-0 advantage, Harvard showed a late flicker, posing a threat in the final inning with consecutive singles. BU closed the game out moments later, as shortstop Melissa Dubay caught a rocket line drive off the bat of Crimson junior Melissa Schellberg and tossed the ball to Emily Roesch, who stomped on second base for a 6-4-3 double play.  
Harvard is confident that its performance will be strong in coming weeks. Perhaps context will ignite its offense this weekend, as Harvard faces Yale at home on both Saturday and Sunday.
“It’s Ivies, so this is when it really counts,” Vertovez said. “Come this weekend, we’re going to want to kill Yale.”
The Crimson is not welcoming any more visits from the dreaded, hollow integer. Harvard has a shot at redemption on April 30th, when the team once again faces BU in the regular season finale. Until then, the players must get into a new rhythm over the next seven games.
“Hitting is contagious,” Vertovez said. 
One hit, one run, one win at a time. One is far from zero.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Its tight-fisted grip on the Ivy League championship reduced to a finger-tip pinch, the Harvard men’s tennis team will face trying times this weekend.With its first home loss in the Ivies since 2005 and its Ancient Eight destiny out of its hands, the Crimson (9-8, 1-1 Ivy) will try to reclaim the initiative on the road with this weekend’s double-header against Princeton (9-8, 1-2 Ivy) and Penn (9-9, 0-3 Ivy).Following last weekend’s narrow defeat at the hands of Ivy League leaders and No. 57 Columbia, Harvard has zero margin for error as it looks to retain its highly-sought crown.“These [teams] are traditionally really strong rivals,” said Crimson coach David Fish ’72. “For many years, we’ve faced off against Princeton for the league title, and other years we’ve faced Penn for the league title. They both have a very proud tradition of tennis.”With two singles wins in two Ivy League dual matches, Harvard’s lineup leaders—senior co-captain Chris Clayton and sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans—will look to continue their impressive form at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. The co-captain, leading the team with an overall 16-9 record and No. 77 ranking in the nation, believes that hard work holds the key to the Crimson sustaining a competitive Ivy League defense.“We’ve been training pretty hard for this weekend,” Clayton said. “We’ve ran more this week than we did last week. I really think we’ve upped the intensity.”The Tigers enter the weekend’s action reeling from close losses against No. 60 Yale and Brown, with its solitary win in the Ivies coming in its season opener against Penn. However, Harvard knows it will need maximum concentration to win Friday’s clash. The Princeton team has climbed as high as No. 73 nationally this season and boasts the abilities of the 2008 Ivy League Player of the Year, senior Peter Capkovic.“[Capkovic] and [Clayton] have had battles, between a couple of the top players in the region, getting to the semi-finals of the regional championships,” Fish said. “It’s going to be tough.”Saturday’s match with Penn is equally far from straightforward. While the Quakers hold the unwelcomed label of Ivy League cellar-dwellers, it has also gone a perfect 6-0 in home matches this season, with two players—Phil Law and Jason Lin—recording 20 wins in singles play.Complicating matters, the Crimson faces an opponent desperate to avenge a Harvard loss from earlier in the season. In February’s ECAC Men’s Indoor Tennis Championship semi-finals, the Crimson prevailed over Penn in an extraordinary 4-3 victory—the deciding point settled by a thrilling third set tiebreaker at No. 1. Despite dropping the first set, Chijoff-Evans came from behind to beat Penn’s Hicam Laalej and secure a breathtaking 3-6, 7-6, 7-6 (9-7) win.“We saved match points against Penn in the ECAC Championships,” Fish said. “They’ve got the same lineup that they had then, so we’ve got a big battle there too.”In last season’s corresponding matchups, Harvard dismantled its opponents, dropping only one point over both fixtures. With so ruthless a display in two closely-fought games against Columbia and Cornell—the margin of victory a single point in both—the Crimson team of 2009 will aim for history to repeat itself.If only college tennis was that simple.“[Princeton and Penn] lost their opening matches, but when we come out, we always seem to have a target on our back,” Fish said. “So we always seem to make people play their best against us, and we try to see that as a sign of respect.”—Staff writer Allen J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew teams will finally get to break the ice this weekend with their first races of 2009 on the Charles River. 
Both squads will look to carry early season momentum into their home-opening contests after strong performances this past weekend at the San Diego Crew Classic for the heavies and in Princeton, N.J., and Philadelphia, Penn., for the lights.
The heavyweights will challenge Brown in a quest for its first dual cup of the season—the Stein Cup—on Saturday, while the lightweights take on Dartmouth and MIT for the Biglin Cup. 
Although the Crimson boats will match up against different opponents, both will enter this year’s contests with chips on their shoulders, having finished second in the races last season.
But Harvard’s heavyweights can take comfort in the 2009 race for the Stein, as the squad will compete in the familiar confines of Boston.
“It’s nice to have the luxury of rowing on a home course,” heavyweight captain Teddy Schreck said. “[Avoiding] the travel aspect is big. It’s really nice not to have to go somewhere and rowing on the Charles is what we’re used to.”
Despite the opportunity to row at home, the Crimson will have no easy task matching up with the Bears. 
Last year Harvard took four of five races in Providence, but dropped the varsity eight heat, relinquishing the cup to Brown. 
However, after a solid third place showing among a talented field in San Diego, the squad is brimming with confidence and has revenge in sight.
“Brown is big for us,” Schreck said. “They are traditionally a big rival in our conference and it is very competitive towards the end of the year. We had the opportunity to race them last week, so we have an idea of their relative speed.”
Indeed, the Crimson has already sent a message to the Bears, finishing two spots ahead of its rivals in San Diego.
This result, coupled with exceptional efforts in practice, has Harvard looking to put even more distance between itself and Brown tomorrow.
“From week to week the goal is just to…use practice to race better the following week,” Schreck said. “We’ve put in quite a bit of work, and [the upcoming race] will give us an opportunity to assert ourselves and show some speed.”
With a long road ahead until championship races in June, Harvard recognizes that this weekend’s race only marks a starting point. 
Although the squad has the advantage of familiarity with its opponent, the Crimson will focus on the broader goal of team improvement rather than results.
“We can only control what we can control and race as hard as we can,” Schreck explained. “[This race] sets the tone for the start of the season and gives wus an edge to carry through to the championship.”
For the fifth-ranked lightweights, Saturday’s race against Dartmouth and MIT represents a chance to continue the team’s spring dominance. 
By going 4-0 against Columbia, Cornell, Georgetown, and Penn less than a week ago, Harvard’s varsity eight will take to the river as favorites. 
Last weekend, the crew posted a blistering time of 6:22.2, nine seconds ahead of the Big Red, the defending national champion. Considering the quality of the Crimson’s first showing, it has high hopes that simply racing consistently will bring improvement over last year’s loss to the Big Green.
“I think the biggest thing we are hoping to do is just race the full 2000 meters and row as technically sound as we can,” senior Stephen Barchick said. “We had a great week last week as a team, but it’s a new week and we’ve got some good opponents.”
For it’s part, defending Biglin Cup champion Dartmouth will also enter Saturday’s race undefeated. The Big Green lightweights challenged Delaware in their spring opener, winning three of five races, including the varsity eight, who squeaked out a win over the Blue Hens by a margin of 0.2 seconds. 
The Engineers will have some ground to make up on both squads, as it finished third behind Georgetown and Yale last weekend in all three of its races. With MIT calling the Charles home, its boats may be able to close the gap, but the Crimson will likely find itself in more of a two-team race.
Regardless of the outcome for the Stein and Biglin cups, both squads appear ready to dig in for a competitive spring season. Like his heavyweight counterpart, Barchick expressed excitement at the chance to break in the Charles, even if spring warmth remains elusive.
“We love racing on our home course,” he said. “In terms of weather we’ll see how it goes, but we’ll just have to focus and row our own race.”

OMG BRANGELINA I JUST WANT TO TOUCH HIM SHE’S SO GORGEOUS OMG!!!  So sayeth FlyBy.
Sorry. So here's the deal: Actor James Haven came to the Kirkland Junior Common Room yesterday to accept a designation as the International Relations Council’s Harvard Global Health and AIDS Coalition's Senior Honorary Advisor for 2009.  Whatever that is.  FlyBy isn't sure either.  But there's more:  Haven's sister, actress Angelina Jolie, and her partner Brad Pitt were scheduled to attend the event so that they could  see good old Jimmy get his award.  Too bad they never showed. Figure out what happened (with more pics of Haven chilling at John Harvard’s) after the jump.
There was some disgust and disappointment on display in Kirkland JCR when it became evident that Brangelina would be flaking on the 80-odd assembled Harvard undergrads (and a few more looking in the windows). Word on the street is Angelina’s doing some filming out on Long Island, and couldn’t make it up for the event. So instead, the students patiently absorbed Haven’s words of worldly wisdom concerning positive action (yada yada), marveled at his erudite quotations from sources as varied as Mother Teresa and Frederick Douglass,  and eagerly clung to the hope that the star couple would make a delayed appearance.  They didn't.
No big deal.  By the end, Haven’s address was in fact energizing, focused on the need to bring responsibility and compassion to the problem of third-world underdevelopment.  Still, not all in attendance were appeased.
“You know what this is?” one listener asked, “Joey McGraw all over again…”
All in a day's work for Haven. FlyBy found the actor (excuse us, "International Relations Council Senior Honorary Advisor") deep in conversation with some event organizers after the event. (Photos by Bonnie J. Kavoussi)

Are you an Adamsian who's tired of seeing your House library overflowing with refugees?  A Winthropian who doesn't bother to learn the hours for your House library because chances are it's closed anyway?  If so, you're in luck: Harvard has other lovely study spaces.  You don't have to stay in your dimly lit walk-through to throw yourself into Foucalt or drill Latin verbs.  Although many reading rooms are open only during the day--unfortunate timing for procrastinators and FlyBy reporters--if you're the type who studies when the sun is still up, these locales are perfect for in between classes.  Here's a taste:

The George Edward Woodberry Poetry Room
The quiet poetry room, nestled next to the 24/7 Farnsworth Room on the top floor of Lamont, is the place to stumble on inspiration.  Poetry books and recordings surround the few tables in the spacious reading room, which overlooks Tercentenary Theatre.  The spire of Memorial Church stands tall against the blue sky.  If you get bored of writing that paper, you can put on your reading glasses, lean back on a blue couch, and toss open an anthology of Wallace Stevens or the latest issue of the Kenyon Review.  You can also go to the computer at the front of the room and contribute to the Woodberry Poetry Room Daily Poem, which was started to celebrate Lamont's 60th anniversary.  Anyone who walks into the room can add a line to the poem.  Too bad when your faithful blogger walked into the room, it had only this one line: "Each generation begins again the going there."  The title?  "Utopiaward."
No wonder no one else had added anything.  Three more of Harvard's finest under-used study spaces are listed after the jump.
The History Department Library
The History Department Library is nestled next to the department itself on the second floor of Robinson Hall.  It is a convenient place to escape to in between class--especially if you are a History concentrator who lives in the Quad.  The library is always quiet, with no more than two or three people studying there at a time.  The two-story library mimics the History concentration itself: piled with books and declaring it's legit--replete with book-ladders and a spiral staircase.

The Herbert Weir Smyth Classical Library
The Classics Department's library, tucked away on the third floor of Widener Library, requires more exclusive access than the History Department's.  You need to either be a Classics concentrator or taking a Classics course that requires access to Smyth for the readings (the best reason to take an ancient history seminar or Classics department course).  Or, if you are planning to do a secondary field and a foreign-language citation and just don't have the room in your schedule, you can try to pretend to be a concentrator when asking the department administrator for swipe access.
Smyth is a gorgeous place to study--surrounded by classical literary criticism, small statues, and the portraits of old white men.  Okay, the last are sort of intimidating.  Graduate students whip out their dusted hardcovers with the Greek original--and only the Greek original--of Homer, Herodotus, and Plato.  The Loeb editions--with Greek on one side and English on the other--are too childish for them.  Don't plan on looking at Facebook photos in this library.
Café, Lamont Library
Everyone knows about this one.  The café is a quiet, oft-neglected place to study* or engage in spirited intellectual conversation.  Indeed, by day it resembles a veritable coffeehouse--the type you would find in 18th-century Enlightenment Europe, where Diderot and Montaigne would discuss the great ideas over a newspaper and cup of coffee.  Yeah right.  More like sweaty undergrads crammed together eating all the food.  But whatever, it gets the job done.  You're probably reading this there now.

With next weekend's Yardfest approaching quickly, the College Events Board (CEB) seems to be receiving much less criticism than usual for its choice of artists--Sara Bareilles and electronic group Ratatat. Cue new advertising efforts: the most notable of which has been the "Ratatat Remix Challenge," intended to reward the creator of the best Sara Bareilles-Ratatat mashup (with what? It's unclear). Has the CEB stumbled upon the next Girl Talk? Read on.
FlyBy took the opportunity to listen to the four finalist mashups, with comments from this FlyBy writer below. The files for play can be found here:
"Love Song for Seventeen Crips"--Laurence Holland '09, a former Associate Managing Editor for The Crimson.
Though it gets off to a slow start with an unusual background, once  "Love Song for Seventeen Crips" moves to the Ratatat beat it evolves into a carefully crafted interweaving of electronics, piano, and the lyrics of Sara Bareilles' most prominent hit, "Love Song." Close attention to detail here.  Not bad.
"Thing You Wanna Hear"--Mike Polino '11 and Garrett Schabb '09
"Thing You Wanna Hear" changes gears multiple times. While the different strands are layered on top of each other with smooth transitions, Sara Bareilles' voice seems almost like an afterthought, and often her melodies do not mesh with the electronic background, creating unusual combinations of notes. A solid Ratatat mashup, but perhaps Bareilles has a song that would fit with it better than her best known.
"SaRatatat"--Michael Shen '12 and Maxwell Meyer '12
"SaRatatat" has a catchy start with a bouncy beat mixed in with "Love Song" that reappears again later in the mashup. The mid section features repetition of the line "I'm not gonna write you a love song," that gets a little bit...well...repetitive, despite the catch background. The mashup ends strongly with a Ratatat musical interlude. Overall a solid, catchy remix.
"Love Song (Obi Ekekezie Remix)"--Obi Ekekezie '12
This mashup seems mostly like a remix of "Love Song"--intended to turn it into a punchy dance song. Unlike the others, it plays the song in its entirety from start to finish while mixing in different electronic beats from Ratatat in the background. There's a brief, slower interlude in the middle before the original rythmn picks up again, which might interrupt the dance party but it also breaks the monotony. While it might be a less involved mashup, it's also a more realistic one.
This FlyBy writer's personal favorite? "Love Song (Obi Ekekezie Remix)." This is fun to listen to and could fit in very well with a party playlist. It works with the two music styles equally well and avoids any awkward moments or transitions.
Voting is open until tomorrow, so don't let FlyBy stop you.

This post was removed from the front page because it was based on inaccurate information. In fact, according to Jeff Solnet '12, who coordinates the Pizza and Politics program, the events have not been downgraded as this blog post stated. Popcorn and Politics had just been offered as an additional event.
It began with a simple goal: bringing together undergraduates and political paragons using a promised pizza dinner as irresistible bait. The dream begun, nearly two decades ago, was called “Pizza and Politics.” Drawing in past speakers like investment whiz Warren Beatty and award-winning producer Frederick Zollo, it was at one time a weekly-pegged program of the Institute of Politics.
But now, as the University’s financial belt ever-so-evidently tightens, it seems political enthusiasts may have reason to further tighten their belts as well: “Politics and Pizza” has been downgraded, at least temporarily, to “Popcorn and Politics,” according to students at the IOP.
That’s right. As a cost saving measure, the IOP will cut back on incentivizing student participation with ooey-gooey cheesy goodness. Instead, you’ll be left uncomfortably picking kernels out of your back molars or discreetly whispering to your neighbor “Am I clean?” while curling back your upper lip.
More on the IOP's culinary cutback, after the jump.

If all of this seems a little ridiculous to you, you’re not the only one. FlyBy has it from one IOP organizer that for her event earlier this semester, she was forced to run from the IOP to the Women’s Center and back to the IOP, scrambling betwixt various committees, to secure some scrappy slices.
Colleen Berryessa, a sophomore in Currier House and a participant in several IOP programs, told FlyBy of the change, “I really enjoyed the Pizza and Politics events, but now the smell of burnt popcorn constantly reminds me that it is gone.”

FlyBy was browsing the Web and found this.  Ahoy, there. Facebook has created a new quiz to test what Ivy League school we should go to?  Sort of like the sorting hat in facebook form, eh?  FlyBy was intrigued.
Written by a Harvard and a Columbia grad, this 10-question quiz says, "Whether you went to one, are going to one, want to go to one, or could have gone to one (but chose not)"--FlyBy: people DO that???--"find out which one Ivy League school is right for you." FlyBy decided to try out the quiz on its favorite guinea pigs, the prefosh. See if they deserved their placement, etc.  See how the little rascals did, after the jump.So, here's the deal: Three-fifths of the lab rats received the heartwarming confirmation that they do indeed belong here.  One of the remaining two, placed no doubt in a less desirable Ivy, even took the test again for good measure.   The results were reported to FlyBy:
 
Indeed.  Well, so be it.  But don't feel bad, freshmen.  This FlyBy blogger got Dartmouth.

EDITORS NOTE: This post was intended as an adaptation of an article originally published in the Harbus, the student newspaper of Harvard Business School. However, the initial post did not make the source of the idea clear or cite the Harbus prominently enough. FlyBy regrets the error. Please check out the original Harbus article here.
Although the Harvard dating scene pretty much ranges from minimum to awkward to nonexistent, it's no secret that many still view Harvard as a breeding ground for legacy babies. Many female prospectives get starry-eyed just thinking about Harvard. And no, they aren’t dreaming of 4-years of HUDS eating, Orgo midterms, or beautiful New England weather.  Instead, they're contemplating that ravishingly handsome Harvard boy who will whisk them away into a lifetime of I-Banking (insert financial crisis joke here), supported vacations in Monaco, stylish lofts on the Upper East side, a golden retriever, and 2.4 progeny, Harvard class of 2029. Because, really, where else will there ever be a gathering of so many future millionaires, politicians, lawyers and doctors eager to shed lifetimes of awkward social behavior and just get laid?
In order to help out our female readers on the prowl, FlyBy has broken down Harvard’s dating scene using Porter’s Five Forces. (For you uninitiated humanities concentrators out there, this is a rubric for industry analysis.  Very popular among MBAs and budding business people.)  Find out more on how to land a life long partner after the jump.
The Firms
From the bubbly freshman to the cultured senior, Harvard girls (er...firms) are intelligent, attractive, and successful. They have many things to offer to the consumer, including companionship to date events, help on Ec-10 problem sets, and a lifetime of love and happy times--or at least as many times as a future medical student/CEO/general savior of the world can offer to a partner.
Threat of Substitutes
EXTREMELY HIGH. The pool of non-Harvard females looking for Mr. Right in the form of a handsome, intelligent Harvard boy is extremely large, especially given the number of colleges in the Boston area. Cosmopolitan BU girls are right across the river, driven Babson females are a short shuttle ride away, and then there’s always Wellesley girls…enough said.
Threat of New Entrants
LOW. Because of the fluidity of the market, it is fairly easy for a non-active female firm to suddenly become very active and participate in the market. But declining acceptance rates into Harvard hinder entry for the vast majority of outside female firms.
Bargaining Power of Customers
HIGH. The undergraduate class is pretty evenly divided into males and females. However, because the female firms have less markets in the Boston-area where they can feasibly hope to hawk their wares, and because of the high threat of substitutes, the Harvard male retains high bargaining power.
Bargaining Power of Suppliers
LOW. To the average customer who is more interested in Miss. Right Now than Miss. Right, the supplier has minimum power in distinguishing her product. The high availability of competing female firms with similar products also undermines the bargaining power of suppliers.
Competitive Rivalry Within the Industry:
LOW.  Competing female firms often lack the necessary resources (namely, time) to sufficiently compete and enhance their marketing strategies. Although disputes between competing female firms over the loyalties of particular customers do arise, the competition to initially land a costumer is low and often unnecessary.
Conclusion: Although Harvard may not be the best market for these female firms, it is often the only viable market in terms of convenience. And because of the undesirable brand of the Harvard name when latched onto a female. That said, Harvard girls can still do well by distinguishing themselves from their competitors and fostering more loyalty. If all else fails, female firms can still expand into other similar markets. Hey, the Business School and Medical School aren’t too far away!
