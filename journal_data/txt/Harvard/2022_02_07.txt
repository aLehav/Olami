Actress Jennifer Garner was honored as the Hasty Pudding’s Woman of the Year on Saturday. The annual celebration returned to its traditional in-person format after being held virtually in 2021 due to Covid-19.
The ceremony began with a parade through Harvard Square, and was followed by a roast and press conference in Farkas Hall.
Garner led the parade standing in a Bentley convertible, flanked by two members of Hasty Pudding Theatricals, dressed in drag. The parade began in front of the Inn at Harvard and ended at Farkas Hall. During the procession, Garner waved to onlookers who lined the streets of Harvard Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Jan. 23, in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, English singer Damon Albarn said that Taylor Swift “doesn’t write her own songs.” His remark ignited immediate online controversy, eventually transforming into a viral debate over song-writing and ownership. Albarn, best known for his vocal and lyrical work in the aughts bands Blur and Gorillaz, further clarified in the same interview he thinks that Swift mainly co-writes and is therefore not as skilled with a pen as solo writers. He went on to say he considers himself a “traditionalist,” praising artists like “Billie Eilish and her brother” Finneas, who co-write their music, for their songwriting capabilities.
Swift has been fighting claims against her songwriting for most of her career — and this new occurrence suggests her battle is far from over. More than ten years ago, she wrote the entirety of her third album “Speak Now,” solo, at just 19 years old. So why, six genre-bending albums and two re-recordings later, is her lyrical mastery still being questioned?
Fans will continue to speculate about constant criticism and defend Swift, but at least one thing is clear: Swift will continue to stand up for herself. In response to Albarn’s interview, the mega pop star tweeted, “@DamonAlbarn I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this. I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don’t have to like my songs but it’s really fucked up to try and discredit my writing. WOW.”
Albarn responded with an apology to Swift on Twitter, writing, “I totally agree with you. i had a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait. I apologise unreservedly and unconditionally. The last thing I would want to do is discredit your songwriting. I hope you understand. - Damon.”
As the conflict spread online, Swift was not alone in defending herself, and a plethora of musicians, many of whom have previously co-wrote or co-produced music with her, spoke out in attestation to her craft. Jack Antonoff, lead singer of the band Bleachers and Swift’s longtime collaborator (and close friend), tweeted, “i’ve never met damon albarn and he’s never been to my studio but apparently he knows more than the rest of us about all those songs taylor writes and brings in.” Ryan Tedder, lead singer of the band OneRepublic and independent songwriter, went to Instagram to speak in support, writing “@taylorswift can write better songs by herself, without help, than 99.99% of living writers.” Venerated country music legend Dolly Parton also spoke to Swift’s talents, saying “she’s a great writer — with or without anybody.”
Online users were quick to detail the inaccuracies and inconsistencies of Albarn’s words: first, Swift does indeed write her own songs, with chart-topping hits like “Lover” and “Back to December” credited solely to Swift. Fans also pointed out the contradictory nature of dismissing Swift’s skill because she co-writes, but praising Eilish, whose brother Finneas co-writes much of her repertoire. And Albarn’s particular remark that Swift’s music is “endlessly upbeat” quickly spiraled into fans satirically showcasing her most deeply emotional ballads, and even ironically dancing to her most somber songs. The depth and breadth of Swift’s music is on full display in her 2020 masterpieces, folklore and evermore, whose poetic lyricism and profound themes garnered critical acclaim.
Albarn’s initial comments were neither the first time Swift’s songwriting capabilities are questioned, nor will they be the last. To some online writers, this phenomenon demonstrates elements of systemic sexism in the music industry.Victoria Richards wrote in The Independent, “while Albarn is busy trashing his reputation, and losing fans…Swift is only marking herself out as more of an icon.” Indeed, if anything Swift has made clear that her creative sensitivities are far from exhausted, as she just keeps putting out more music, proof that her pen has yet to run out of ink. Perhaps this is her greatest act of resistance to the many skeptics of her craft: the persistence and perseverance to just keep writing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Neil Young is no longer rockin’ with Spotify. In a since-deleted letter posted to his website on Jan. 24, Young urged his management team and record label to remove his content from the streaming platform immediately. The reason for this action? “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading fake information about vaccines — potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them,” he wrote.
Specifically, Young refers to “The Joe Rogan Experience,” a popular podcast that Spotify acquired exclusive rights to in 2020, saying: “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.” Evidently, Spotify chose Joe Rogan, and the company announced that they would begin removing Young’s catalog as of Jan. 26, 2022.
Young is not the first to criticize Spotify’s relationship with Rogan, and recent developments indicate that he will not be the last. The first major instance of public criticism occurred in Dec. 2021, when over 200 scientific and medical professionals signed a letter urging Spotify to “moderate misinformation on its platform.” The group cited instances where Rogan “discouraged vaccination in young people and children” and “promoted off-label use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19” during his podcast (use of ivermectin to treat the coronavirus has been strongly discouraged by the FDA). Additionally, Rogan hosted Dr. Robert Malone, a physician permanently suspended from Twitter in Dec. 2021 for spreading COVID misinformation. Dr. Malone used his appearance on the podcast to claim that Americans who choose to wear masks and get vaccinated are “hypnotized,” named this phenomenon “mass formation psychosis,” and then compared the pandemic-era United States to Nazi Germany. “The Joe Rogan Experience” is estimated to have over 11 million listeners per episode on Spotify, highlighting the wide influence of Rogan and his guests.
Since Young’s exit from the streaming platform, a growing list of stars, including Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren, punk rock band Failure, India Arie, and Young’s former bandmates from CSNY have also removed their content from Spotify. Many of these artists directly credited Young’s precedent for their decision, with Joni Mitchell writing she “stand[s] in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue” before condemning the “irresponsible people [who] are spreading lies” in a message posted to her official website.
The Spotify-Rogan controversy raises larger questions about the responsibility online platforms have to moderate content that is spread through them. In response to increased public criticism following Young’s departure from the platform, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek issued a statement on January 30th committing to the addition of content advisory messages to any podcast that discusses COVID-19, as well as asserting that Spotify provides trustworthy and up-to-date information about the pandemic through its COVID-19 Hub. Additionally, Ek insisted that Spotify will more strongly highlight its Platform Rules to Spotify creators to help them understand their “accountability” for the content they post. This statement suggests that Spotify will continue to regard itself as a platform, not a publisher, of opinions such as Joe Rogan’s, a stance that Ek reportedly doubled down on during a recent address to employees in Los Angeles.
As for Neil Young fans, listeners can still find his music on Amazon and Apple Music, the latter of which recently designated itself “The home of Neil Young” on Twitter.

The Internet has no lack of time-consuming fads and intriguing crazes, many of which come and go, but how long will this latest one, Wordle, last? The online game, which is simple in concept but slightly more challenging in practice, has captured the attention of millions of users a week. If you’ve been hearing questions along the lines of “Have you done the Wordle yet?” or statements like, “I have a green and a yellow” or exclamations such as “I got it in 2 tries!” and you’re lost: Just hop onto Wordle and see for yourself how you fare.
The internet’s latest and greatest pop culture obsession was actually a quarantine conception by Josh Wardle and, as documented by The New York Times, is the product of a love story. Wardle created the game as something his partner would enjoy and decided to share that simplicity and fun after seeing that game’s popularity among his family members. He said to The New York Times, “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun.”
It seems that the public is attracted to the game — as any Twitter feed will tell you — but why? How did this minigame capture the attention and focus of so many? Perhaps it’s to do with the site itself, that the straightforward website layout, lack of ads, and barebones objective make this a good little brain break. Or perhaps it’s that it provides a worthy challenge for eager minds. We like to prove competence in what we think we’d easily know, and when that doesn’t work out so well, the game provides users with just enough frustration to keep them coming for more and continuing to play the game. The limiting factor of one game a day is also a competitive component: People want to keep those winning streaks up.
They say “That imitation is the most sincere form of flattery,” and this rings true for Wordle. Since Wordle’s major spike in popularity and user traffic, various spin-offs have been created by enthusiastic Wordle fans. This writer has entertained the Taylor Swift version (Taylordle), the “lewd” varieties (Lewdle and Sweardle) and the “absurdly” hard version (Absurdle). And there is even a numerical Wordle (Primel and Nerdle) for those who are more quantitatively inclined, or maybe just guessing letters if you’re feeling that type of way (Letterle).
But the original also has an exciting future on the horizon. In recent news, The New York Times has added Wordle to its word game arsenal, paying somewhere above $1 million for the platform. Current players are concerned about what this means for the game. Will there be a paywall to overcome in the future? Will the original be lost to the average user forever in its original form? Only time will tell what The New York Times will do with Wordle. But for now, we know that the grey, yellow, and green tiles will continue to occupy screens once a day for many.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many Harvard students, navigating Cambridge and Boston comes down to one letter: the T. For navigating courses at Harvard, however, it often comes down to the Q, a database of student evaluations of prior courses and teaching staff.
In the often highly exclusive environment that is Harvard, the Q Guide democratizes access to knowledge about this institution and provides vital information from students’ own experiences on a widely accessible platform. This is especially relevant for students who arrive on campus without a network of peers — First-Generation, Low-Income students; students from underrepresented backgrounds; students not from preparatory high schools; and so on. Critically, the Q also allows for these students to share their experiences, to highlight the issues they face, and create a virtual network of peers.
At its best, the Q Guide is a campus-wide effort by students to look out for one another’s academic endeavors. At its worst, the Q Guide provides a platform where students weaponize anonymity and leave mean-spirited reviews that transform the Q into their personal hate mail pigeon. When some comments published in the Q Guide for all students to read condemn and only condemn, we question the extent to which they are useful. Such behavior conveys a disappointing lack of empathy for teaching staff, as if trying to exact retribution for a course that has personally “wronged” them.
Beyond unconstructive criticism, the credibility of Q Guide comments can be discounted by our implicit biases that color our judgments and subtly dictate the vocabulary we use in evaluating teaching staff. As a result, multiple Harvard faculty have expressed doubt in Q Guide reviews’ capacity to reflect instructors’ true teaching ability. Seth Robertson, a lecturer in Philosophy, explained: “White, male, cis, able-bodied instructors with regular voices get repeated as much more credible.” For instructors whose identities and appearances may not align with unspoken expectations of competency, Q Guide reviews can be guided by unjust preconceptions and run the risk of reinforcing harmful stereotypes that endanger the quality of scholarship and pedagogy at Harvard and beyond.
Professors and their teaching staff need feedback on how to better cater their courses to their students, and we should give it to them. Yet, the bottom line remains: Teaching staff — no matter their perception as the best or the worst in students’ minds — deserve to be treated with and spoken about with respect and dignity. Empathy should not be an ideal; it is the bare minimum. We must always remember that our words fall upon real people, whose professional careers and characters can be marred by unnecessarily harsh and insensitive reviews. By acknowledging this responsibility and the potential consequences, students, faculty, and employers alike should be mindful both in writing reviews and forming judgments based on them. Given the Q’s spacious room for error and uncertainty, a negative review should never be the irreversible verdict of an academic career.
Still, the Q, or some iteration of it, will always be in circulation by students seeking insight into courses. With that in mind, students should leave comments in earnest. Currently, the largely polarizing, either extremely positive or extremely negative comments on the Q, while sketching a vague contour of past experiences, do not truly reflect any course. Individual experiences are valuable cornerstones that help build our current understanding and later institutional memory of courses at Harvard, but to only express the overtly positive or negative prescribes an overwhelming absolutism: creating the illusion of a singularly possible learning experience that fails to capture an entire world of academic pursuits at Harvard. We ask that you exercise your power as a reviewer wisely: Just as you hope to find fair and useful comments on a course you’re interested in, others rely on your thoughtful, dependable feedback too.
Similarly, in your capacity as a reader of the Q Guide, we ask that you read it wisely, much like how you would (hopefully) read The Crimson: Carefully, with respect for both yourself and the writer as humans that can differ in experience and perspective, and with your own judgment. Aside from the Q, utilize Canvas sites, course syllabi, and external evaluations on teaching staff to formulate a better-informed characterization of a course.
So take this as our cue to you: If you care about the Q’s credibility and utility, then you must all take care and consideration into what you put into it — because that is exactly what you will get out of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The word “and” best characterizes my life. I have Indian-American cultural roots and I am a spirited New Yorker. I am a neuroscience enthusiast and a fervent journalist. A news junkie and an Adirondacks backpacker. A bold leader and a thoughtful team player. I am this and that, never one or the other.
Upon entering college this past fall, I was exposed to the “ands” that others cared passionately about — “ands” I never could have even imagined. My residential proctor enlightened me about her previous job as a traveling church singer and published writer during an advising meeting. My roommate and I ate mouthwatering waffles at Zinneken’s while she vividly described her athletic journey as a track and field hurdler in Canada and as an international sprint competitor in Kenya. My fellow health policy team member bewildered me with his keen infatuation for tomato soup and his simultaneous deep distaste for ketchup as we enjoyed a meal in Annenberg.
These newfound “ands” kept encouraging me to pause and reflect. For years, I had been satisfied and grown comfortable with which traits I attributed to myself. After stepping foot in Cambridge, however, I found myself yearning for new perspectives to inspire me to accumulate more “ands.”
In September, I auditioned for the Harvard Bhangra team on a whim, looking for a way to stay active while exploring a new technique of Indian dance. After two hours of navigating the various arm, leg, and facial movements, I truly attained an appreciation for the dance and its intricacies. Since then, sharing smiles and joy with my team members at our twice-a-week practices has been a hallmark of my Harvard experience. Through Bhangra, I discovered the value of genuine love within a group of individuals and how a tight-knit community enables more fulfilling successes all around. I began recognizing that the experiences I was tacking on to my “ands” facilitated a greater sense of both self and collective purpose.
Soon, however, I came to the difficult realization that not all “ands” originate from heartwarming circumstances.
My life took a drastic turn in November. I found out that my grandfather in India had lost complete respiratory function in his right lung and only had 60 percent function remaining in his left lung. The warm grin I had long seen on FaceTimes rapidly faded away as my grandfather spiraled into unconsciousness, unable to recognize his own grandchildren. Within mere weeks, he passed away.
Helplessness overwhelmed me.
Separated by 3,000 miles from my parents who had traveled to India on emergency grounds, I was left to secure individual strength alone while my academic and extracurricular commitments forged onward. Resiliency entered my toolkit of “ands.” During those arduous weeks, I spent meaningful time with friends, provided virtual support to my younger brother, and recognized that it was okay to ask for help.
I had always assumed that Harvard students were warriors who never struggled. Warriors who came to college from the ranks of valedictorians, world-class musicians, and Olympics-bound athletes with an indisputable upward trajectory.
From both personal and outside experience, I have come to find that this absolutely is not the case — and that is exactly how it should be.
Vulnerability is an essential component of growth. By allowing ourselves as Harvard students to take a pause and reflect on our losses, we procure the agency to better alleviate the struggles of others during their times of difficulty.
The painful weeks after losing my grandfather imparted to me the strength to be courageous both in times of internal battles and to never cease lending a helping hand to others. During the last two weeks of the fall semester, the “freshman plague,” more commonly known as the flu, invaded campus. My friends began succumbing in a domino-like fashion. In response, I headed to CVS and assembled packages with self-care products, chocolate, and cards that I filled with positive affirmations for a quick recovery. After some of my classmates began isolating themselves in their dorms to avoid spreading their illnesses, I emulated a part-time food delivery service, picking up meals at Annenberg and dropping them off at the doors of their dorms as they recovered in isolation.
These moments of help were simple, yet quite meaningful to me. The “and” of embodying an individual of confidence, loyalty, and unwavering support became the “and” I am the proudest of.
During my first semester living and breathing in the ever-evolving, vibrant, and diverse Harvard community, I am grateful to have tacked on so many more “ands” to my list. I am now a lover of Belgian waffles and a dining hall conversationalist. I am a confident Bhangra team dancer and a care package maker. Above all, I am a woman of resilience and I am an individual who people can always firmly trust and depend on.
I have come to believe that to be a person of “ands” involves galvanizing the communities and individuals around you to embrace challenges with an open heart and sincere love. Let us cherish the “ands” in the people around us, and let us strive to never be content with only the “ands” we carry now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I stepped onto Harvard’s campus as a first-year last semester on the backs of greats. I entered Harvard revering the legacies of scholars like W.E.B DuBois, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, and Cornel West, just to name a few, but that wasn’t the selling point for me. It wasn’t until I found out that one of my favorite scholars, Fred Moten, attended Harvard as an undergraduate that I really felt secure in my decision.
Now, as I have made it through my first semester at Harvard, none of their legacies bring me ease or satisfaction. The more I learn about Harvard, the more I realize that every student — past, present, and future — enters Harvard on the backs of slaves. Slaves who served as janitors, as kitchen maids, and as personal servants for the University and its students. Even University administrators and professors owned slaves, all of which has been documented in a publication about the legacy of slavery at Harvard.
As Frank Wilderson says, “Where there are Slaves it is unethical to be free.” No institution has been untouched by slavery and anti-Blackness in the U.S., and like anti-Blackness, Harvard also precedes the founding of the United States. Harvard was the first institution of higher learning in what is now known as the U.S., and because of this Harvard has played a large role in higher education in America. However, this influence has a dark side, as many of Harvard’s benefactors, students, and faculty were deeply involved in the slave trade.
While Harvard carves out spaces for Black scholarship through its African and African American Studies Department and its Legacy of Slavery Research Grants, its legacy of slavery continues to extend into the present. Harvard currently invests in prisons, refuses to give back photographs of slaves to their descendants, and disposseses indigenous populations worldwide by purchasing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of land in Brazil, Africa, and the United States. We also can see with the refusals of tenure for Professors Lorgia García Peña and Cornel West that Harvard’s legacy of slavery affects the present, as Black people are still seen as disposable and fungible by the University. This illuminates why it is impossible to see the legacy of Harvard as extricable from slavery. Slavery has always been and always will be a part of Harvard, and acknowledging this legacy brings up an ethical dilemma that calls into question the legitimacy of Harvard all together.
If Harvard — or any colonial institution — wanted to truly address the harms that they have perpetrated over the past 500 plus years, all they would have to do is “Return Turtle Island to the ‘Savage.’ Repair the demolished subjectivity of the Slave,” as Wilderson writes in his book Red, White, and Black. Harvard claims to want to address its legacy of slavery, but instead they use their money and resources to fight a court battle where Tamara Lanier is trying to get her ancestor’s daguerreotypes back from the University. And yes, Harvard gives $1500 grants to students to research about Harvard’s connection to slavery, but at the bare minimum that should be coupled with a pledge to give reparations to the descendants of slaves that were owned by the University, administrators, professors, or anyone else that worked or studied at Harvard.
A commitment to addressing the harms of slavery is a commitment to addressing the harms of anti-Blackness. There is no way to address the effects and legacies of slavery without addressing how slavery still seeps into our everyday lives, from our political institutions to even the ways that we study, learn, and interact with knowledge — especially at Harvard. If Harvard truly wanted to address its continuing legacy of slavery, Harvard’s educational practices, their investment strategies, and overall ways of existing as a University would be different. If Harvard truly rectified its harms of slavery, Harvard as we know it today would not exist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new Harvard Graduate School of Education class is developing a series of case studies as a part of the University's Initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, which began in 2019.
Students enrolled in “Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery: A Normative Case-Study Writing Initiative” — taught by HGSE professor Meira Levinson — are creating case studies and teaching guides that will focus on the “complicated and ambiguous ethical choices” departments and institutions face, according to the course description.
Levinson serves on the initiative's curriculum subcommittee, which is examining how educators and students can best approach their study of Harvard’s historical relationship with slavery.
“We all have learning to do, and we can't expect students to learn things if, as faculty and staff and alumni, we remain ignorant,” Levinson said. “The learning needs to be much more broad-based.”
HGSE student Catherine G. Huang was drawn to the topic of universities’ ties to slavery after her experience as an undergraduate at the University of Virginia during the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally, where white nationalist groups marched in Charlottesville.
"I think what's unique about this class is that it's not necessarily solution-oriented," Huang said. "It really leans into the uncertainty that generates new possibilities of action, because they don't know what exactly is the right thing to do just now."
Huang also said she values the complexity of the ethical dilemmas students discuss in the course, such as what universities can do with endowments obtained through unethical labor practices.
“What should we do with a university's endowment if that endowment was historically a direct profit of enslaved laborers’ work or forced labor, plantations, or things that they produced?” she said.
Huang said she hopes for broader intellectual participation from Harvard affiliates on the issues covered by the course, noting that  “only some people are doing the work” to grapple with the University’s historical connection to slavery right now.
“What I would like to see is that responsibility being shared and action being taken by larger and wider coalitions of Harvard affiliates,” she said.
Levinson said she intends for the case studies produced in the course to be used in and outside of the University, noting that none of the topics addressed in the course are unique to Harvard.
“We think that Harvard can learn from other universities and that other universities can learn from Harvard,” Levinson said. “We're all part of a much bigger conversation about the questions about universities’ responsibility.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow reiterated in a Thursday interview Harvard’s commitment to academic collaboration with foreign scholars following the federal conviction of Chemistry professor Charles M. Lieber.
Lieber was found guilty in December on six federal charges, including two counts of making false statements to government agencies and four related tax fraud offenses.
Bacow called the situation “unfortunate” but said he is “comfortable” with the University's policies on disclosing research collaborations and obtaining permission to use the Harvard name.
“We’ve always had policies requiring the use of the Harvard name,” he said. “These are policies which are well known to our faculty.”
Bacow also said it is important for Harvard affiliates to continue collaborating with foreign talent.
“It’s important that the United States continue to be open to scholars around the world,” he said. “I have tried to support the efforts of students and faculty to continue to gain entrance into this country from wherever they come from and will continue to do so.”
Bacow added that Harvard benefits from collaboration with foreign scholars, noting that some of the University’s brightest minds hail from China.
“As an institution, we have responsibilities to continue to protect our own intellectual property and we’ll do that, but I think it’s wrong to single out any particular group for scrutiny,” he said. “Some of the finest students and scholars we have in this University come from China and will continue to come from China.”
More than 2,300 Harvard students and scholars hailed from China during the 2019-2020 scholastic year – approximately 23 percent of the University’s international population, according to the Harvard International Office.
“Information flows in both directions,” Bacow said. “That’s the way scholarship is done, and it’s the way scholarship must continue to be done.”
Experts predict that Lieber’s conviction could provide momentum for the Department of Justice’s controversial China Initiative, which targets espionage. Harvard faculty said they were “shocked,” “saddened,” and concerned about future international collaborations following Lieber’s conviction. Some criticized the way prosecutors targeted Lieber, who is set to be sentenced at a later hearing.
Asked Thursday about Harvard programs that accept funding from firms in the fossil fuel industry — which have come under fire from student climate advocacy groups in recent months — Bacow defended the University's collaboration with industry, saying faculty members have the "right to engage and work with people from across the spectrum of industry, ideology, and different groups."
“I think it’s important, if we are going to influence and change the world, that we need to collaborate and work closely with those whose behavior we seek to change. And that requires us to engage with industry," he said. "And so we will continue to engage with industry in the hope of accelerating the transition to a decarbonized economy."
Still, the University’s climate plan continues to push Harvard’s operations and investments away from fossil fuel ties.
The Harvard Management Company is set to become carbon neutral in its internal operations during fiscal year 2022, according to a report released Thursday. HMC continues to work toward net-zero greenhouse gas emissions associated with the University’s endowment by 2050, a goal it set in April 2020.
The University announced in September it would allow its remaining indirect investments in fossil fuels to expire, but still does not have a timeline for total divestment. Bacow noted third parties manage the remaining investments, which Harvard has no control over.
Bacow was also asked about the following:
Search for New Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow
William F. Lee ’72 — the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body — is set to step down from his role in June, when he will be term limited off the board. Bacow said picking Lee’s successor is “a consultative process” involving every Corporation member.
“It’s not my decision, nor should it be my decision,” he said. “Bill Lee, the current Senior Fellow, is managing the process.”
Bacow added that he would stand behind any current member of the body as a potential candidate.
Omicron and Campus Life Amid Covid
Bacow defended the University’s move to transition away from requiring Covid-positive affiliates to move into school-provided isolation housing. In January, the school implemented an isolate-in-place model that allows undergraduates who test positive to stay in their rooms. He cited the high vaccination rate among Harvard affiliates and the school's limited isolation housing capacity.
“We felt that this was, in fact, the right way to go — and it’s proven to be the case,” he said.
Bacow added the University has “managed to contain” the virus on campus, noting the current positivity rate is below 1 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admissions experts welcomed the College Board’s move to shift the SAT to a virtual format, but described the change as an effort to stay relevant amid a rise in test-optional admissions policies.
The College Board announced last month that it would administer the SAT exclusively in a virtual format starting in 2024, following a pilot program last year. The move comes after just 1.5 million members of the class of 2021 took the SAT — a drop from the 2.2 million who took the test the year prior.
Harvard announced in December it would implement a test-optional policy through the Class of 2030 in light of Covid-19.
“‘In a largely test-optional world, the SAT is a lower-stakes test in college admissions,” Priscilla C. Rodriguez, vice president of College Readiness Assessments at the College Board, said in a press release. “Submitting a score is optional for every type of college, and we want the SAT to be the best possible option for students.”
Some admissions consultants said the decision is an effort by the College Board to maintain relevance as more colleges make standardized tests optional.
“The million dollar question — or the $2.2 million question — is, can the SAT come back to relevancy?” said Daniel L. Valenti ’09, a managing director for admissions consulting firm InGenius Prep.
“Their goal is to both have as many customers — as many students — take the test as possible, and also keep the test as accurate or as relevant or as predictive as possible,” Velanti added.
Katie Burns, a counselor at admissions consulting firm IvyWise, said the move was made in an attempt to keep up with an “increasingly digital” world.
Admissions consultant Steven R. Goodman said the College Board was motivated by its own interests.
“The College Board, surprise, surprise, does what’s good for the College Board,” Goodman said. “They're going to continue producing tests that they perceive to be something that they can distribute.”
Still, some admissions counselors praised the move as being beneficial for students.
Goodman said he welcomes any simplification to a process that disadvantages students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
“The admissions process is inherently skewed against those students, simply because the admissions process is so complex,” he said. “Anything that simplifies the process makes it easier for more students to apply and therefore reduces barriers.”
Burns said she hopes the shift to a virtual SAT will alleviate some of the stress in admissions processes that can be “the most anxiety most 17- and 18-year-olds experience in life."
Some experts also praised the SAT’s adoption of an adaptive testing model in which the test’s difficulty changes depending on the student’s performance in previous sections. Standardized tests like the GMAT and GRE have used adaptive testing for years.
Valenti called the test’s new adaptive approach “a positive change.”
“Using technology to pinpoint where somebody’s strengths and weaknesses are is typically helpful,” he said. “It can be more targeted that way as well.”
But Jay Rosner, executive director of the Princeton Review Foundation, said any change would be minimal.
“The test will produce results that are similar to the results that are always produced by the tests — by the SAT in particular,” he said.“The same disparities along the same lines.”
Consultants were mixed on the effect the virtual shift would have on admissions as a whole.
Burns said standardized testing, in some form, is here to stay.
“I don't know that most admissions offices will ever get away from having standardized testing be an option in how they evaluate applicants,” she said.
Rosner said the success of colleges’ move toward test-optional policies during the pandemic, however, spells bad news for the College Board.
“That's the nightmare of the College Board and ACT,” Rosner said. “It's one thing to think about test-optional in theory. It's another thing to experience it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After making it through two weeks of the semester without a major spike in Covid-19 cases, Harvard loosened its public health restrictions last Friday.
Dining halls are once again operating at full capacity, and undergraduate testing cadence was reduced to twice per week.
The changes come as Covid-19 cases are declining rapidly in the greater Boston area. In Cambridge, just nine new cases were reported on Saturday, compared to 449 one month prior.
Harvard’s Dean of Students Office announced the updates in an email to undergraduates on Friday. The changes bring the school’s dining and testing policies back in line with what they looked like last fall, prior to the arrival of the Omicron variant.
In addition to relaxed dining and testing policies, indoor events will again be allowed to have food and beverages if they follow other University health guidelines, such as providing space for social distancing and notifying attendees that food will be available.
But several other precautions remain in place. Non-sponsored informal gatherings remained capped at 10 people, and students who test positive will continue to isolate in place and conduct their own contact tracing.
Harvard changed its Covid-19 restrictions at the start of the spring term to adapt to the fast-spreading Omicron variant, which is highly transmissible but poses a reduced risk of severe illness to most young people. Many classes went remote for the first week of school, dining was grab-and-go for the first two weeks, and students were instructed to test three times per week up until the Friday announcement.
Over the past seven days, 209 Harvard affiliates tested positive for Covid-19, including 47 undergrads, per the University’s Covid-19 Dashboard. The positivity rate on campus has been steadily decreasing over the past month — from 5.07 percent during the first week of January to 0.60 percent last week.
The updates also come after some students have spoken out against continued Covid-19 restrictions in recent weeks.
Sophomore Rajiv M. Sastry ’24 said he thought the initial policies were a “wise choice,” for the first few days but needed to be loosened as the semester kicked off safely.
“Once it became clear that there was not going to be a significant spike in cases, I thought that the policies were a little bit heavy-handed,” he said. “And [they] especially disadvantaged kids who didn’t live in the river houses.”
Ben Meron ’23 said the dining hall reopenings provided a needed space to get to know housemates.
“It makes it a lot easier to socialize and have a community, especially in some houses where there’s not one central building. The dining hall really is the center of the community,” Meron said. “A lot of people agreed that at the beginning of the semester, it didn’t really feel like the semester really started.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MBTA officials and municipal policymakers are considering changing fare structures to increase access to public transportation services.
The MBTA proposed changes in late January to expand reduced-fare options for riders. Some of these proposals expand no-cost transfers to all riders, while others include a five-day unlimited pass on commuter rail and lower costs of one-day unlimited transfer passes available to all riders. For reduced-fare riders, the MBTA proposed seven-day and monthly unlimited passes.
Mayors across the state have introduced their own proposals, with some calling for the complete elimination of bus fares. On Jan. 27, Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui sent a letter calling on the MBTA to implement a fare-free bus service pilot with the possibility of transitioning it to a permanent program. Nearly 30 elected officials representing 15 neighboring towns and cities joined Siddiqui in signing the letter.
The letter calls for “a fair, equitable, and standardized process for implementing fare-free bus pilots, and potentially permanent fare-free service on specific MBTA bus routes.”
The City of Cambridge is also taking the initiative on expanding fare-free service. City Councilor Burhan Azeem wrote on Twitter last Thursday he will be chairing a working group piloting fare-free buses in the city.
The letter argued free bus fares will eliminate barriers to public transportation and that this will encourage people to leave their cars at home and opt for the bus, reducing emissions and improving traffic safety. Moreover, it argued riders need the incentive of free fares to return to buses post-pandemic, which experienced lower ridership in January.
Municipalities offered to compensate the MBTA in lieu of fares in the letter. The letter cited a previous fare-free bus program that made the popular bus route 28 free as evidence for the policy’s success.
“The Route 28 bus carried more than 12,000 daily riders before the pandemic,” the letter reads. “The pilot provided valuable insight into the effects that eliminating fares has on ridership, transit costs for residents, boarding times, and the experience of bus riders and drivers.”
The cited program included an initial $500,000 investment in the route to make ridership free.
Boston Mayor Michelle Wu ’07 included fare-free transit in her platform during her recent mayoral campaign. On her first day in office on Nov. 16, she asked the Boston City Council for funds to eliminate fares on three bus lines for two years.
The MBTA will hold public meetings on Feb. 10 and Feb. 17 to gather resident feedback on the proposed fare changes. Any changes to fares would go into effect July 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study led by Harvard School of Public Health researcher Aaron S. Bernstein found that the cost of preventing diseases transmitted from animals to humans is just 5 percent of the estimated value of lives lost from emerging infectious diseases.
Bernstein — the interim director of HSPH's Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment — and his team estimated the value of lives lost to all viral diseases transmitted from animals that resulted in 10 or more deaths since the 1918 flu pandemic.
“We chose to look at a century's worth of [diseases] to understand that these costs are not just one-offs. They're not, ‘We have a Covid pandemic and all of a sudden all those damages go away.’” Bernstein said. “We have ongoing losses every year, and diseases like HIV, which have persisted for decades now, have enormous aggregate tolls upon economies and lives.”
The study builds on a paper published last summer analyzing the financial cost of the Covid-19 pandemic compared to that of primary preventative measures.
The researchers used an estimated willingness to pay for life-saving measures to calculate the value of the loss of life. Depending on the country, the willingness to pay to prevent the loss of a life spans from $107,000 to $6.4 million. Applying this estimate, researchers found that the cost of deaths due to diseases from animals equals $350 billion to $21 trillion annually.
To mitigate these losses, the researchers suggest spending $20 billion on preventative measures, such as suppressing deforestation, surveying wildlife trade, and monitoring and suppressing wet markets.
The researchers said such prevention methods will have benefits beyond stopping new pandemics, such as biodiversity protection and carbon sequestration.
“The list of things that we've suggested are all things that we know how to do and have all sorts of other benefits,” Stuart L. Pimm, an author of the study and professor of conservation ecology at Duke University, said.
“It also has returns to the environment, has returns to local culture in indigenous communities, and it has returns to economic development,” Marcia C. Castro, an author of the study and professor of demography at the School of Public Health, added.
Bernstein also said these preventative measures can serve as “equity-promoting actions.”
“Vaccines benefit the wealthiest people first and the least wealthy people with the least access to health care last,” Bernstein said. “Primary prevention actions, on the other hand, benefit those most vulnerable first.”
Bernstein said it is imperative to take a preventative approach, rather than waiting to deal with the consequences of future diseases and pandemics.
“We simply cannot afford to take a post-spillover approach,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After notching three consecutive wins over Ivy League opponents, Harvard women’s basketball returned to Lavietes Pavilion this past weekend in triumphant fashion. On Friday night, the Crimson (12-9, 6-3 Ivy League) earned a hard-fought 77-73 victory over the Brown Bears (5-15, 0-8). The following night, Harvard treated its large home crowd to a 65-59 win over the Yale Bulldogs (13-8, 6-3), extending the Crimson’s winning streak to a season-best five games.
HARVARD 65, YALE 59
Harvard (12-9, 6-3 Ivy League) continued its winning ways after toppling conference rival Yale (13-8, 6-3), evening the season series at 1-1. First-year guard Harmoni Turner was the star of the contest, stuffing the statsheet with 25 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, and 4 steals. Her running mate, junior guard McKenzie Forbes, contributed 15 points, 8 boards, and 4 steals of her own to help lift the Crimson over the Bulldogs.
“The [team’s] chemistry is getting stronger,” Turner said. “Considering that we are the underdogs, we take that really personally. This is our home court and we wanted to defend [it].”
The first quarter of the pivotal Ivy League matchup proved to be a defensive battle, as Harvard was held scoreless for over three and a half minutes to open the game. The drought ended when Forbes converted an and-one layup to even the score at 3-3. The teams split free throws before Yale junior forward Camilla Emsbo took over, going on a personal 6-0 run, widening the Bulldogs’ lead to 10-4. Sophomore forward Lindsey Lawson converted the final basket of the quarter off of a Turner assist, cutting the deficit to 10-6.
Harvard came out in the second quarter on fire, going on a 13-2 run and holding Yale scoreless for over 5 minutes in the quarter to take its first lead of the game, 19-12. The Bulldogs fought back, reducing the Crimson’s advantage to 21-17. Harvard would have the last word of the quarter once more, as Forbes dropped a dime for senior guard Tess Sussman, who converted the layup. Harvard forced 15 turnovers in the opening 20 minutes and held Yale to 7-for-26 shooting, claiming a 23-17 lead at the half.
That advantage quickly evaporated, though. Harvard started the second half shooting 0-5 from the field, allowing Yale to go on an 8-1 run in the first two minutes of the 3rd quarter and go on top, 25-24. That would be the Bulldogs’ last lead of the game, however, as Forbes responded by muscling in a layup through contact and sending Yale’s Emsbo to the bench with three fouls. In the 6’5” forward’s absence, Harvard began attacking the paint and getting to the free throw line, extending its lead to seven before Yale sent their star back out onto the floor.
For Harvard head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, the stretches of poor shooting from the Crimson were indicative of an offense that was settling too early rather than keeping their opponents off balance by moving the ball, but she lauded the fast-paced, attacking style that sparked her team’s run in the second half.
“We weren’t running our offenses, so we just decided to run and gun,” Delaney-Smith said. “We did it to tire [Emsbo] out, and it worked.”
What offense Harvard did drum up in the second half largely came from the hands of the electrifying Turner. After the Bulldogs held her to six points in the first two quarters, the first-year got going after the break by drawing fouls (8 of her 25 points came from the charity stripe) and creating shots for herself in the midrange and from beyond the arc.
Turner’s performance, which matched her career high in points, was another positive chapter in a rookie season that already has Delaney-Smith describing her leading scorer as a “superstar.” The Texas native also led the team in assists (including a nifty no-look pass to junior guard Maggie McCarthy in the corner to close out the third quarter), evidence of the growth that Turner has exhibited all year long.
This growth has lifted up all members of the young team, and is a big part of the Crimson’s five-game winning streak that clearly has Harvard’s players enjoying themselves on the court. On Saturday, the squad exhibited confidence, smiling and laughing with each other deep into the fourth quarter and always seeming to have the game under control, never letting their lead fall below six for the entire fourth quarter.
Yale gave the home crowd a scare with just over a minute to go with a 3-pointer that brought the game within two possessions, but Turner came right back down and hit a dagger from NBA range to effectively seal the Bulldogs’ fate.
Entering the home stretch of the Ivy League season, Delaney-Smith praised Harvard’s defensive effort against their rivals. A night after being frustrated by inconsistent play on the defensive end, the 40th-year head coach was proud of her team for rising to meet a difficult assignment as an undersized team playing against bigs like Emsbo.
“The whole premise of what we were trying to do was not to be beat on the drive, because we have to double down [on their bigs] and scramble up,” she said. “And we were almost 100% effective at it. I couldn't ask us to do it any better than we did.”
The Crimson will hope to keep its defensive momentum going as they look ahead to the Ivy League tournament, which Harvard will host at Lavietes Pavilion on March 11-12. Conference leaders Princeton and Columbia have been formidable all season, but Delaney-Smith has seen enough to not put limits on her group’s potential.
“Having the tournament here is motivation to dig deep and make it,” Delaney-Smith said. “Then, anything can happen.”
HARVARD 77, BROWN 73
Harvard began Friday night’s matchup with Brown looking to replicate its convincing 89-58 road win against the Bears on Jan. 7. Although the Crimson raced out to a 21-9 lead through the middle of the first quarter, Brown’s two-three zone defense and Harvard’s shooting struggles from the perimeter produced a tight first quarter, with the Crimson holding a 24-19 lead.
Delaney-Smith noted that with Harvard now facing its conference opponents for the second time in the season, adjustments from both sides can lead to much different outcomes than the first matchup.
“I think the first game [against Brown] was an enigma,” Delaney-Smith said. “Half their team was missing, so the first game was not indicative [of their play] at all, and we crushed them in the first game. That's always a bad omen. I tried to warn everybody that wasn't the Brown team we're going to see tonight, and it wasn't. They were far better tonight.”
Central to Harvard’s early lead was Turner, who recorded eight of the team’s first 14 points and continually pushed the pace to generate open shots for her teammates. Turner leads Harvard in scoring at 15.5 points per game, and her 16-point, 11-rebound performance Friday against Brown represented another big step in her development at the college level.
“In terms of development, I have definitely trusted the process,” said Turner. “I had a rough start at the beginning of the season, and that was because I did not trust the process, I'm gonna just be brutally honest. But as soon as I started feeding into the system, and trusting my coaches and the team, then I think we definitely capitalized on that.”
After both teams traded baskets in a physical second quarter, the Crimson entered halftime holding onto a 41-36 lead. To energize Harvard’s offense in the second-half, Delaney-Smith placed junior guard McKenzie Forbes in the middle of the Bears’ two-three zone defense. Although Forbes, who averages 13.3 points per game this season, was held scoreless in the first-half, her shooting ability and offensive versatility allowed her to explode for 19 points in the final two quarters. After the game, Turner explained the importance of Forbes for this Harvard team.
“I think we definitely feed off each other very well,” said Turner. “Kenzie [Forbes], she was getting the shots in the beginning of the game, they just weren't falling. I think what made her keep going was her continuous shooting. And us as a team, we all have trust in each other.”
As the game approached the final buzzer, the Crimson grasped a 75-73 lead. Brown’s out-of-bounds play with 1 minute left, however, resulted in a turnover. After a three-point attempt from McCarthy rimmed out, Brown’s Kyla Jones raced up the court for a chance to win the game. Blanketing her on defense was Harvard junior guard Annie Stritzel, who ripped the ball from Jones with 11 seconds remaining. A pair of free throws from Forbes sealed the nail-biting 77-73 victory for the Crimson.
“Annie [Stritzel] is one of our best defenders,” Delaney-Smith said. “She switched on to [Jones], who was driving on us [all game]. And Annie did a great job. She picked her pocket and she forced her right, which is what we were supposed to be doing instead of letting her go left all night long.”
The Crimson will look to continue its string of success when the team returns to Lavietes Pavilion for a matchup with the Penn Quakers this Saturday, Feb. 12 at five p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Men’s Hockey (12-7-2) team was sheltered from Friday’s hail by the Bright-Landry Hockey Center’s roof, as they took on fellow Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) member and Ivy League competitor Dartmouth (3-15-3). The Crimson pulled out the win, 3-1, earning its fourth straight victory.
“It was a good game,” senior forward Jack Donato claimed proudly. “[We] usually throw the records out the window this time of year- they played hard and didn’t make it easy on us…we stuck with it and got what we needed.”
“I thought we did a lot of good things. I give Dartmouth a lot of credit…” head coach Ted Donato added. “[It’s the] time of year where games start to get really tight and competitive and defensive.”
The first period set the tone for a very competitive game. Both teams came out fast, with Harvard dominating the possession initially before the Big Green recalibrated to make the last 15 minutes of the first period a lot more aggressive.
Neither team recorded a score; however, both had power play opportunities. The Crimson’s senior captain and forward Casey Dornbach was charged with interference about 11 minutes in, while first-year forward Austin Wong drew a hooking penalty from Dartmouth’s Braiden Dorfman just past the ten-minute mark.
Harvard junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson recorded five saves from five Big Green shots on goal; Dartmouth’s masked man Clay Stevenson was credited with stopping all of the Crimson’s 11.
Harvard came out fast in the second period. Just over two minutes in, Jack Donato scored his third goal of the season, assisted by sophomore defenseman Jack Bar and first-year defenseman Kyle Aucoin. Donato deflected Bar’s slap shot, with the puck finding the net after slipping under the Stevenson’s pad.
About two minutes later, the Crimson had a power play opportunity after a hooking call on Dartmouth’s Sean Koehan. It capitalized on this opportunity, as first-year forward Matthew Coronato finished junior defenseman Ryan Siedem’s initial shot.
Seven minutes, 33 seconds into the period, Harvard’s Aucoin and first-year forward Tommy Lions were both sent to the box, for tripping and slashing, respectively. This gave the Big Green an opportunity at a 5-on-3. Despite Dartmouth not recording any shots on goal in the period before the penalty, Ian Pierce converted on the chance, scoring with just three seconds left in the power play to cut the Crimson’s lead to one.
“I think we can do a little better job staying out of the box,” Ted Donato expressed. “The five-on-three was completely avoidable. We took a retaliatory penalty and that usually does end up biting you.”
The remainder of the period consisted of Harvard controlling the puck, although they were unable to execute on two more power play opportunities. Gibson recorded four more saves.
The third period consisted of tough, competitive hockey. There was only one penalty, as senior Wyllum Deveaux was sent to the box for slashing about three minutes in, but the Crimson were easily able to kill the advantage.
Harvard outshot the Big Green 21-11 in the third; however, it was unable to score until only five seconds remained in the game and Dartmouth had pulled Stevenson from the posts. Junior forward Austin Wong finished the open goal; Jack Donato and junior defenseman Henry Thrun were credited with the assists.
“Get to the front of the net more,” said Jack Donato of his strategy, which has resulted in three points in the last four games.  “It's where a lot of the dirty goals are and D [defensemen] are doing a good job of getting pucks to the net.”
The Crimson will take on Boston University, who head coach Ted Donato called “maybe the hottest team in the country right now,” on Feb. 7 in the 69th annual Beanpot Tournament at TD Garden. Puck drop is currently scheduled for 5 p.m. and the game will be televised on NESN+.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Next Monday, the 7th, is the first Monday in the month of February. In the city of Boston, that means it's time for the Beanpot. The annual tournament brings the best out of Harvard, Northeastern, Boston College, and Boston University and crowns the best collegiate hockey team in the Boston area.
The 69th rendition of the event begins this Monday, with the Harvard Crimson taking on the Boston University Terriers at TD Garden at 5 p.m.
“I think in light of all of the difficulties last year to even have a chance to play in the Beanpot is something we’re grateful for,” Harvard head coach Ted Donato remarked. “It's a great opportunity to play against a team that's very talented and we have a lot of confidence in ourselves and worry about our game. And it should be a heck of a game.”
Headed into Monday, Harvard holds a 12-7-2 record and is on a four-game win streak. It has yet to face Boston University this year. The Terriers are 14-10-3, and have won eight of their last nine.
The Crimson will have its depth tested, facing No. 19 BU with two of its top point scorers, junior captain and forward Nick Abruzzese and sophomore forward Sean Farrell, away representing Team USA in Beijing.
The newly promoted first line of sophomore forward and Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) player of the month Alex Laferriere, junior forward John Farinacci, and first-year forward Alex Gaffney will look to step up and attack BU’s goalie Vinny Duplessis. Duplessis has been starting since Drew Commesso left to join Abruzzese and Farrell on Team USA’s roster.
In net for Harvard will likely be junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson, who has started 17 of the Crimson’s 21 games this season, posting a .911 save percentage. He, along with junior defenseman Henry Thrun, have led the Crimson’s defense to an NCAA 14th-highest penalty kill percentage this season, 85.7%.
The current senior class looks to savor their last Beanpot, after losing one to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“It should be pretty emotional,” senior forward Jack Donato claimed. “Our class has never been to a final so we’re going to have that on our minds but [we] just [need] to play the game the right way…we’re going to go in there and give it our best shot.”
If Harvard defeats BU on Monday, it will play the winner of the BC-Northeastern game (Monday, 8 p.m.) the following Monday to play for the Boston hockey crown, 7:30 p.m. at TD Garden. If it succumbs, it’ll face the loser of BC-Northeastern, for third place, 4:30 p.m. at TD.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team (2-4) fell to Purdue Fort Wayne (6-4) on Saturday, abruptly ending the team’s two-game win streak at the Malkin Athletic Center. Shouts and cheers from fans and players alike reverberated through the vaulted ceilings of the MAC’s top floor in the first match of the spring semester but ultimately resulted in a Harvard loss.
The Mastodons got off to a strong start in the first set — 6-2 — before the Crimson could stop the damage. Although Harvard managed to dig its way out of this early deficit, subsequent Mastodon runs proved too much to counteract. Although Purdue Fort Wayne took the first set 25-17, the Crimson’s competitive advantages, such as senior outside hitter Eric Li, were quick to warm up despite the team’s two-week hiatus. Li had 11 kills and seven digs overall.
“There’s always a mental and physical aspect to not playing in two weeks,” Li said. “It’s certainly there, though I thought we did a good job to minimize it. It was mainly our own mistakes getting to us in that first set, and [those] are things that, regardless of whether you haven’t played in one month or a few days, you always have to be ready for and be as sharp as you can.”
Service errors plagued both teams, as each side missed 18 serves over the course of the match.
Going into the second set, Harvard looked to pick up its energy and forget its previous mistakes. Nevertheless, the Mastodons continued their momentum by once again taking an early lead of 6-2. Three service errors and a couple kills gave Harvard its second lead of the match at 9-8; the other came at 2-1 in the first set.
“We [settled] in and had a new gear,” Li said. “[It was] the most energy we’ve played with this whole preseason.”
This energy came in the form of attacks from first-year outside and opposite hitters Logan Shepherd and Kade McGovern, who notched 10 and seven kills, respectively. Sophomore middle blocker Ethan McCrary also recorded seven kills. This offense was supported by first-year setter James Bardin, who had a career-high 37 assists on the night and has tallied 177 through his first six collegiate games.
“Coming out of a first set like that, the guys did really well to bounce back in the second,” senior captain Jason Shen said. “We talked a lot about ‘0-0,’ resetting — and the guys came out with energy.”
Shen led the defensive effort on Saturday, digging out 11 balls that otherwise would have been Mastodon kills.
Three-point runs from each team tipped the scales back and forth, but the Crimson managed to pull out two four-point runs, starting at 15-15, to take the second set 25-20.
“We had moments in the second set where we were playing really good volleyball,” Shen said. “We set out for ‘first pass, first set, first swing.’ That’s what we have to do against every team.”
Shen was drawing on lessons he and the rest of his team took from their previous five matches of the season, which began on Jan. 12. Harvard took the court for the first time in 683 days, replacing the frigid, snow-filled streets of Cambridge with sunny California to begin its season with three top-15 matchups.
The Crimson started its Golden State campaign at No. 15 UC Irvine (3-5), playing three competitive sets but falling to the Anteaters 25-19, 25-22, and 25-21. Harvard’s persistence was spearheaded by the team’s younger players, as sophomore blocker Ethan Smith and McGovern posted nine and eight kills, respectively. Bardin led the team with 26 assists in his first collegiate match. The team matched UC Irvine at 33 kills but fell short in aces and blocks, thus paving the way for the Anteaters to go on runs in otherwise deadlocked sets.
The team made its way down the coast to La Jolla to play No. 10 UC San Diego (3-3). The Crimson drew first blood, stunning the Tritons to win its first set of the season, 25-16. Senior outside hitter Campbell Schoenfeld and Li contributed 11 and seven kills, respectively, and McGovern continued his stellar start to collegiate volleyball with 11 more kills. Despite the early success, Harvard lost the next three sets 25-16, 25-20, and 25-23. In the loss, however, Bardin racked up 34 more assists, and Shen fulfilled his libero duties with a strong defensive performance of 12 digs. Shen’s contribution led the Crimson to out-dig UC San Diego 42 to 40, but Triton senior outside hitter Kyle McCauley and middle blocker Logan Clark each posted double-digit kills to give the Californians the edge in the last three sets.
Rounding out its west coast tour, Harvard went up against fifth-ranked Long Beach State (5-1), but the Sharks proved too much, running away with the match 25-18, 25-16, and 25-23. Schoenfeld was the only Crimson player to reach double-digit kills, and Bardin posted 20 more assists. Despite trading points early in each set, Harvard could not stop the onslaught from Long Beach hitters like Clarke Godbold and Spencer Olivier. The team would have to wait for its first win of the season on the east coast.
“Coming out of the west coast tour, it was great because we played a lot of really good teams and knew we could play at that high level of competition,” Shen said. “It showed us we can hold up against big dogs.”
The Crimson would not have to wait long for its first victory of the season, however, as it handily won the first two matches it played at the MAC. In its home debut, the team faced off against Queens University of Charlotte (4-3) and King University (1-6). Harvard easily defeated Queens, 25-20, 25-14, and 25-19 in its first match at home in 699 days and kept the momentum going against King, walloping the Tornado 25-16, 25-19, and 25-16. In all six sets, the Crimson came out firing, gaining early leads and never looking back. Schoenfeld tallied 22 kills over the weekend, many of which were assisted by Bardin, who had 30 assists in both games.
“Despite coming back and our conference maybe not being the same caliber as those West Coast teams, there are still good teams — teams that have beat West Coast teams,” Li said. “We have to take forward the mentality that we’re winning this conference because we can beat anyone.”
Returning to Saturday’s game against the Mastodons, a contest leveled at a set apiece, both teams fought hard to gain the advantage in the third. This task would prove difficult, as neither team had more than a one-point edge over the other until Harvard took a 12-10 lead. The Crimson opened the gap to 19-15 before Purdue Fort Wayne took a crucial timeout, stopping the slide. Harvard fought to gain a 24-22 advantage and two set points, but attack errrors from Li and Smith gave the Mastodons four straight points and the third set, 26-24.
The fourth set saw the Crimson reeling from the disappointing end to the previous one, with Purdue Fort Worth taking an early lead that soon faded at 14-14 as the home team recovered. Mastodon runs once again opened the gap, but this time Harvard did not have the chance to redeem itself, as the match ended with the Mastodons taking the fourth set, 25-20.
“I’m proud of the fact that we were able to battle in a bunch of big rallies that ended our way, but [there were also] a bunch of others that didn’t go our way,” Li said. We have to figure out how to convert those in the future.”
The loss to Purdue Fort Wayne marks a disappointing end to the Crimson’s preseason. The team begins its conference campaign at home next Friday against No. 5 Penn State (7-3, 2-0 EIVA). Despite this defeat, the senior leaders of the team remain optimistic moving forward.
“If we execute what we know how to do, we’ll be able to take [Penn State] down,” Shen said. “I’m excited to see our guys play to their potential on the court in match time, especially in the big moments. That’s going to let everyone have a lot of fun and win the matches we know we can win.”
“Throughout the preseason, the team was able to spend so much time with each other, on and off the court,” Li said. “That’s definitely going to continue as we go through the season, and that’s something I’m really excited about.”
Li also noted the growing pains of meshing a team of veterans like Shen and himself, who had not seen college play since 2020, with rookies such as Bardin, McGovern, and Shepherd, who had never donned Crimson uniforms until this year. The preseason was an opportunity to develop the trust and chemistry that is necessary for the team’s success.
“As we play more, as we see more of each other on the court, that trust is going to continue to build,” Li said. “I think that what’s going to take us the furthest is that we trust in our abilities, we trust in what we train and practice, and that’ll show through in the games.”

Love It: New Year, Completely Different Me — Stephany Gutierrez
After a much-needed break full of a whole lot of nothingness, there is nothing better than returning to campus full of new year’s resolutions and motivation to do everything you told yourself you would do last semester. The list of improvements that you swear will happen this semester is extensive — actually doing the assigned readings, attending section, exercising more than just walking to and from lectures. While this newfound motivation will soon be replaced with exhaustion, my planner (which is currently ~thriving~) and I are loving being on top of things. Of course, food from back home will be missed, but there is no denying that I missed Tatte and the late-night runs to Noch's. Getting back to campus also meant the unmatched excitement of meeting up with friends and catching up on winter flings and all the shows that we binged.
Returning in January also meant a change in weather for many of us, especially for snow first-timers like myself. Even though we had to layer up, the snowball fights and sled rides down Widener steps have been the perfect start. Fantasizing that you're in a winter wonderland while walking to class is also the best way to destress. Sure, the snow soon turns brown and ugly, but walking past piles of dirty snow is a humbling moment we all need. The start of this semester has been great, and here's to hoping that this will ring true for the rest of it.
Hate It: TAKE ME BACK HOMEEEEEEE — Raymond Wu
I’m going to be honest — fall semester kind of absolutely wrecked me. It drained me of almost all my motivation (and a significant portion of my bank account), and there was no better feeling than finally getting on that plane to go back home. When I got home, I was finally able to do all the things that I was too busy to do during the semester: watch a bunch of movies and TV shows that I’ve been meaning to watch for months; hang out with friends and family; and, of course, catch up on sleep.
In the middle of celebrating the new year with my family, I realized that Jan. 1 meant that, in just three weeks, I would be returning to campus. Don’t get me wrong — I was excited to see my friends and explore places around campus that I couldn’t explore during the fall, but a new semester meant I also had to think about my classes and *shudder* summer internships. Even typing the phrase gives me goosebumps — by the way, lemme know if you come across some good ones ;). The new semester also meant that I had to return to Cambridge in January, and since there was barely any snow throughout December, I knew that meant we were probably going to have a freezing and excessively snowy January (and, well, we did). Though I wish I was still languishing back home (with *not-wet* socks), the reality is that I have multiple psets I’m procrastinating on, so I must grit my teeth and trudge along. Harvard gods, please be kind to me!

It’s the spring semester! The sun is shining! The birds are singing! There’s ice literally everywhere! But at least not in your heart ;) That’s right baby, Datamatch season is here. As one of the only Harvard traditions that survived — and thrived — throughout the pandemic, it’s back again to bring us love, that perfect pset buddy, or free Berryline with your new best friend.
To get the scoop on all things Datamatch, we sat down with Supreme Cupids Melissa W. Kwan ’22 and Katherine Y. Zhu ’23, two true professionals on romance, humor, and ~top secret algorithms~. Whether you’re a seasoned veteran or still waiting to lose your Datamatch virginity, we’ve got your guide on returning fav features, new surprises, and why this kooky survey continues to be our personal favorite tradition<3
 The Basics
For our freshmen and jaded upperclassmen readers, here’s how Datamatch works in three easy steps:
1) Fill out a cute little quiz.
2) Get a list of algorithmically endorsed matches on Valentine’s Day.
3) Go on a date with free food, courtesy of Datamatch.
Basically, it’s your time to go on some adorable platonic OR romantic dates with other Harvard students! Plus, if you don’t have Valentine’s plans, it’s a great excuse to get free food with someone else who also doesn’t have plans ;) And who knows what will happen? In Zhu’s words, Datamatch is all about “genuine human connection,” and they’re here to help you find love, friendship, free food, or whatever you’re looking for this Valentine’s Day.
If you’re looking to throw a little spice into the algorithm this year, two fan favorite features are returning: Crush Roulette and Search Match.
Crush Roulette lets you tip the algorithm in favor of true love (or dastardly schemes). Put two people that you think are meant to be together in the Crush Roulette feature, and wait to “see if the algorithm is in your favor on February 14th,” as Zhu put it. However, putting two names in Crush Roulette is no guarantee that they’ll match, Kwan says, to avoid exposing who may or may not have put a name in the Roulette (and so you sneaky Harvard students can’t game the system!). As for how it affects the secret sauce of the algorithm, “You’ll get the most bump if you both mutually put each other as your Crush, but if a lot of people ship you two, then that will also provide a boost. Your best bet, though, is putting yourself with someone and them putting you,” according to Kwan. So believe in yourself and shoot your shot!
Want to know if your dhall crush has been thinking about you too? Search Match is similar to Crush Roulette, but less random. If you Search Match a user, and they Search Match you as well, you’ll receive a match. And if they don’t Search Match you back, they’ll never know that you did — keeping your scheming a secret forever!
What’s New?
Still not sold? Don’t worry, there’s plenty of new features to keep you on the edge of your seat. What if we told you that Datamatch could tell you why you’re single, and that the algorithm knows everything about you? Well, their new feature isn’t quite that good, but it’s pretty damn close.
This year, Datamatch is introducing a feature that will infer what your own red flags are based on your survey responses. In Kwan’s words, you can choose not to click on it, but “the more you know, the more you know.” If you’re not ready to know the truth, though, Kwan assured us that you can choose not to click that button, and live in sweet, sweet denial. Or, if you’re on the radical transparency wave, they’ll be shareable too — like your own cursed Spotify Wrapped. Though we can’t guarantee that the algorithm won’t roast you for being a guy whose name starts with J…
Exposing your deepest personal flaws isn’t the only new feature that Datamatch is offering this year. If you’re really feeling a connection with your Datamatch date, you can enter to win a free second date at a ~fancier~ location, like Judy’s Bay. We’re not saying free sushi will guarantee that you’ll end up together, but it certainly can’t hurt.
On a more serious note, Datamatch is upping its security features with a “Report User” function. If your match is sending chats that make you uncomfortable for any reason, you can report a match and they will be unceremoniously yeeted from your life.
The Blocklist is also returning this year, so users can choose up to 10 mortal enemies, ex-lovers, and section kids that are guaranteed to be excluded from their possible matches by the algorithm. Shoutout to Datamatch for securing both our love life AND our privacy.
Datamatch Tells Us How Love Works
So you’ve got all the cold hard facts about Datamatch, but how do you know when you’ve found *the one*? You know, the person who will actually match you back and whisk you away to the shared Jefe’s nachos of your dreams?* Let’s dive into the deepest mysteries of the human heart from the Supreme Cupids themselves.
*Flyby can provide no guarantees about finding you The One, but we can guarantee that actually matching with people is a good start…
The following interviews have been edited for clarity.
RLR: Are there any favorite Datamatch success stories?
KYZ: My personal favorite is always the one between Anna and Ryan. So, Ryan was Supreme Cupid for Datamatch 2020. But essentially, Ryan decided that he needed to put a time limit on himself for when he needed to find a girlfriend. Very romantic. He basically made a dinner reservation for Valentine’s Day with no idea who the other person would be and told himself, ‘This is my deadline.’ So, Anna was on the [Datamatch] team at the time, and they were already friends and she was kind of teasing him about this whole Valentine’s thing. And then, Datamatch comes out, and they both Search Matched each other. So they use the dinner reservation that Ryan made, and they’re still together!
PAJ: For all our freshmen out there, what’s the most ~romantic~ spot in the Yard to take your date?
MWK: In the Yard?
KYZ: I’d say the warm spot by Canaday.
MWK: Uh, I would say, like, one of the basements of a dorm. Maybe Thayer?
PAJ + RLR: Yikes…
KYZ: Hey, at least Thayer’s one of the nicer ones!
MWK: Yeah, I was not gonna say Canaday.
KYZ: And definitely not Matthews.
MWK: No, but I’d say this is strictly worse than anywhere else you could take them. Do not take your date to the Yard.
Tragic. And here we thought John Harvard’s foot was the start of every great love affair. :,(
RLR: Have you ever considered creating a Datamatch feature to help you find someone to help you complete the Three Traditions?
MWK: Oh, what do you mean by that?
RLR: So, there’s three traditions, and two of them are very independent —
PAJ: But they could be more fun with a friend!
RLR: Right. And the last one is, uh, more of a partner activity, one might say.
[prolonged silence as MWK and KYZ consider the legal ramifications]
KYZ: I don’t know if we would be, like, explicit about it. [laughs] Any possible consequences of completing that said third, uh, item, we are not liable for it. I guess all we can say is there are a lot of things you can do with your matches. There are also a lot of things you can do when you’re a senior and fill out Match 22 this year!
MWK: Yeah, there are formal date options, and informal date options…
KYZ: So, we are not suggesting anything…
MWK: No, not at all.
KYZ: But again, the world is your oyster.
Duly noted. We will keep petitioning for a DTFITS feature.
PAJ: For the students who have given up on love in this cold, brick-filled university, how do you convince them to sign up for Datamatch?
KYZ: You’ve got nothing to lose, just go for it.
MWK: If your expectations are super low, that’s actually when the results are gonna happen. So you should go in not expecting too much — just do it for fun, answer things that feel true to you, and then someone who actually has the same sense of humor as you might actually be your match.
KYZ: It’s free, the survey is really funny — we hope you laugh at it because we do so much when we write it — and even if you don’t end up getting something out of it in the end, there’s always free food!
MWK: We cannot emphasize this enough, click match even if you’re only semi-interested because then you can get free food, and we’re trying to give out more and more of that this year!
We don’t know about you, but this interview had us headed straight to the survey.
Well folks, this sure sounds like true love to us (at least, between us and the Supreme Cupids… second date soon?). The Datamatch survey is officially open NOW until Valentine’s Day, so don’t let this iconic Harvard tradition pass you by – Fill! It! Out! We’ll be manifesting free food, great matches, and a love life spicier than Pete Davidson’s for each of you this Datamatch season<3
