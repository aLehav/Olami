After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Anthropology Department called on University President Drew G. Faust and other Harvard administrators to protect undocumented students by designating Harvard a sanctuary campus and adopting a “zero-tolerance approach towards any form of hate.”
On Monday, Anthropology Department Chair Gary Urton sent an email on behalf of the department to Faust, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, University Provost Alan M. Garber, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Xiao-Li Meng, and Social Sciences Dean Claudine Gay. The email, which Urton said the entire department unanimously approved, lists seven actions the signatories believe Harvard should take to ensure the safety of undocumented students.
“We join the students, faculty, programs, and departments across the University in demanding a strong, affirmative, and unapologetic stance on this issue from our administration,” the email said.
In the wake of Donald Trump's election, the future of undocumented students has been a topic of concern among students, faculty, and administrators both at Harvard and nationwide. Last week, Harvard students circulated a petition calling for administrative action to protect undocumented students and later hosted a rally. Additionally, more than 350 faculty members signed a letter urging Faust to take action.
Though Faust has not yet responded to the Anthropology Department’s email, she was one of more than 100 college and university presidents to sign a letter, published Monday, in support of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects undocumented students. She also decried the “escalating numbers of cruel and frightening incidents” across the country in an email to Harvard affiliates after the election.
Paul Andrew, Harvard’s Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications, confirmed the University had received the Anthropology Department’s email and said a response is forthcoming.
In the email, the department called on administrators to designate Harvard a sanctuary campus, which would limit its cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The department also asked that Harvard institute a policy that prohibits campus police from inquiring about immigration status or enforcing immigration laws, and refuse to cooperate with any system of registration for a religion, race, or sexual orientation, like the Muslim registry proposed by the President-elect.
Shortly before the department sent the email Monday, Chief of Harvard University Police Francis D. Riley sent a message to Harvard affiliates addressing some of the department’s concerns. Riley affirmed that the police department does not ask about immigration status.
“It is not the jurisdiction, responsibility, or practice of the HUPD to police the immigration status of members of our community,” Riley wrote.
Urton said, despite Riley’s statement, the department still felt the need to distribute the email they had written and add their names to the list of supporters of undocumented students.
“Given the moment, given that we don’t know now what’s going to happen, but things look dark, it seemed important to be on the record as having stated that we support what we say in the letter,” Urton said in an interview.
In addition, the department wrote that the recent election offered “a stark reminder of our responsibility, as anthropologists and educators, to understand and address social inclusion and exclusion as processes mediated by institutions of power.”
“As anthropologists, our research, teaching and service are expressly oriented towards a cultivation of empathy, an examination and critique of inequality, and a commitment to ethics and justice,” the department wrote.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Urton said the department had not received a response from any of the recipients of the email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Lizabeth Cohen criticized Stephen K. Bannon, Donald Trump’s chief strategist, for comments he has made reflecting “racism, anti-Semitism, and more” in an open letter she signed with the presidents of six historically all-women colleges.
In the letter published Monday, the leaders of the academic institutions—Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, and the Radcliffe Institute, which are sometimes referred to as the Seven Sisters Colleges—focus on derogatory comments Bannon made in 2011 targeting graduates of the schools.
Cohen and the college presidents wrote that Bannon’s comments in the 2011 interview with Political Vindication Radio “disparaged lesbians, feminists, and the alumnae of the historic Seven Sisters Colleges” and condemned him for other remarks he’s made that “reflect other forms of bias, including racism, anti-Semitism and more.” 
“As the leaders of the Seven Sisters Colleges, we take deep exception to these comments and ask that you take a more expansive, informed and tolerant world view in your leadership role,” the signatories wrote.
In an interview Tuesday, Cohen said she worked on the letter in order “to say that this is not the kind of leadership that our country needs and deserves.”
Cohen is not the first Harvard affiliate to publicly speak out against Bannon. Last week, two graduates of Harvard Business School—where Bannon received his MBA in 1985—wrote a letter to the editor in the New York Times assailing Bannon as the leader of “ a movement that preaches white nationalism, racism, misogyny, and hatred.” That letter, which more than 1,000 current students and alumni of Harvard Business School have signed, also condemned his derogatory comments about graduates of the Seven Sisters colleges.
In the letter, which was posted on the Radcliffe Institute’s website, the signatories emphasize their respect and admiration for their students, who, they write, are “accomplished leaders in all spheres of public and professional life.”
“We are proud of our alumnae and students, who represent the spectrum of sexual orientation, race, class and religion as well as political party,” the authors wrote.
Cohen said that she was happy to work with the presidents of the other schools, even if Radcliffe is no longer a women’s college. Since being named Dean of the Radcliffe Institute in 2012, Cohen said she has had little to no contact with the other Seven Sisters Colleges.
“Radcliffe took a different direction [than the other colleges], but I was very pleased that they reached out to me because the attack was very much on all of our graduates and we are still in touch with Radcliffe graduates,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 40 percent of the Class of 2017’s newest inductees to the College’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa study within the division of Science.
Students studying within the Social Science division represented about 30 percent of inductees, compared to about 17 percent who study in the Arts and Humanities division. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences had the smallest representation, with 15 perecent.
In total, 48 seniors will be inducted into the oldest undergraduate honor society in the United States, joining the 24 students selected last spring.
Phi Beta Kappa annually honors students who have excelled in their academics while balancing a difficulty and diversity of coursework, selected based on transcripts and recommendations from Harvard advisers. The results were announced Monday to seniors in an email from Jeffrey Berg, Harvard’s assistant director of undergraduate research and fellowships.
Benjamin C. G. Lee ’17, a joint Astrophysics and Mathematics concentrator, described his interdisciplinary experience as one that “opened up doors” for him.
“This work is a nice balance of having some mathematical theory behind it, but also being physically grounded in applications toward astro, to work in both fields simultaneously,” Lee said.
Though SEAS saw the fewest PBK inductees, Applied Mathematics had the strongest representation among all concentrations, with five seniors receiving the honor. Christopher H. Rycroft, the department’s director of undergraduate studies, described the concentration’s requirement that students take 14 to 15 courses as “more stringent than most.”
“We do find that people who are drawn to our concentration are often those really willing to drive themselves with a harder course load,” Rycroft said.
Six of the inductees are joint concentrators, whose work combines two independent concentration fields that culminate in the writing of an interdisciplinary thesis. One senior’s studies even stretch across academic divisions.
Maille E. Radford ’17 is completing a joint degree in Chemistry and the History of Art and Architecture. She wrote that she has appreciated her advisers’ support throughout her unique academic experience.
“It has been a challenging endeavor and I could not have done so without their guidance and encouragement,” Radford wrote in an email.
Engineering Sciences concentrator Erin E. Walk ’17 said that she has tried to take classes outside of her primary field for throughout her college career.
“Every semester I’ve taken at least one class, usually two, that is outside of engineering,” Walk, who will receive a secondary in Government, said. “Taking these opportunities to pursue other interests and enjoy the liberal arts experience at Harvard... has been really important as well.”
Walk is one of 10 residents from Pforzheimer House—the House with the most honorees in the “Senior 48.” Eleven of the 12 Houses were represented, Cabot House being the exception. Among the inductees was one Dudley House affiliate.
Kate S. Hoffman ’17, a Social Studies concentrator who is also a Pforzheimer House resident, said she was surprised by the notification and was not expecting to be one of the inductees.
Hoffman said: “I forwarded my mom the email and said something good is happening this week.”
The students will be formally inducted at a ceremony on Dec. 5.
