After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Neil Portnow got more than he bargained for when he told women in the music industry to “step up” if they wanted recognition on the Grammy stage. Last year’s James Corden-helmed telecast was confusing enough on its own without the Recording Academy President’s shortsighted and sexist remarks. Thankfully, if the past year in music is any indication, this Sunday’s ceremony has a full-scale, women-led reckoning on its hands. Female artists old and new to the industry dominated charts and delighted critics in 2018, sending a message to Portnow, Grammy voters, and the American people that women in music aren’t just “stepping up.” They’ve been here and they’re taking over.
Album of the Year: Dirty Computer (Janelle Monáe)
From start to finish, Janelle Monáe’s futuristic fourth album is a masterpiece. It showcases her prowess as a multifaceted and mega-talented performer — who is just as comfortable rapping “If she the G.O.A.T. now, would anybody doubt it?” on “Django Jane” as she is whisper-singing the dream-pop chorus of “PYNK.” The album contains powerful odes to black womanhood (“Django Jane”), queerness (“Make Me Feel”), and radical self-love (“I Like That”), with infectious beats and mesmerizing melodies to boot. “Dirty Computer” cements Monáe’s genre-defying musical dominance, and the if the Grammy voters value high-quality sound with real substance you’ll see her take home the night’s biggest prize.
Best Pop Vocal Album: Sweetener (Ariana Grande) 
While Ariana Grande may be making headlines this week for a different album (her second of the past six months) her 2018 LP “Sweetener” is almost certain to receive some Grammy love on Sunday evening. The defiant single “No Tears Left to Cry” marked Grande’s fourth straight top 10 lead single, followed by the enchanting “God is a Woman.” In previous years, being nominated in a category alongside Taylor Swift has meant near-certain defeat — not even Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” was able to top “1989” for Album of the Year in 2016 — but victory is looking pretty unlikely for Swift’s “Reputation” this year. Grande’s voice truly shines on “Sweetener,” just as bright as the Grammy she’ll accept for it Sunday.
Best Rap Album: Invasion of Privacy (Cardi B) 
Cardi B said it best on “I Do”: “My little fifteen minutes lasting long as hell, huh?” Any person who questioned whether or not Cardi B had the staying power to follow her smash hit “Bodak Yellow” has since eaten their words. All 13 tracks on the Bronx-born artist’s debut album hit the Billboard 100, and rightfully so. “Invasion of Privacy” is an infectious collection of endlessly quotable songs about love, money, sex, and fame that is just as empowering as it is entertaining. From the idgaf attitude of “I Do” to the fed-up frustration of “Be Careful,” the tracks on “Invasion of Privacy” prove that Cardi B is a savvy performer whose “fifteen minutes” will garner her not just a hit album, but a certain future in the music industry and some Grammy Awards to boot.
Record of the Year: I Like It (Cardi B) 
Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past year or so, you’ve probably heard “I Like It” on the radio no less than thirty-seven times, and for good reason. Cardi B, Bad Bunny, and J Balvin’s Latin trap masterpiece was the artist’s history-making second Billboard No. 1. All three artists are confident and charismatic on their infectious, alternatingly English and Spanish verses, tied together by the chorus’s brilliant, looped sample of Pete Rodriguez’s “I Like It Like That.” Cardi raps on the track: “I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance.” While “Bodak Yellow” may not have taken a prize at last year’s ceremony, Cardi B is sure to be ready and willing to accept a trophy for “I Like It” on Sunday.
Song of the Year: The Joke (Brandi Carlile) 
If you haven’t heard Brandi Carlile’s achingly beautiful post-election anthem “The Joke,” now is the time to listen. The folk-rock singer is the most nominated woman at the Grammys this year, and her brilliantly raw and insightful 10-track album “By the Way, I Forgive You” nabbed nominations for Album of the Year and Best Americana Album, and its lead single picked up nominations in four different categories itself. Carlile’s voice crescendos on “The Joke” from soft, poetic verses to a heartbreaking, howling chorus. By the time she belts “And the joke’s on them” to close out the song when she performs on Sunday, there won’t be a dry eye in the house. For her to leave unawarded for the single would be crime.
Best Alternative Music Album: MASSEDUCTION (St. Vincent) 
St. Vincent is the ultimate performer, one of the few who could put out six albums in just over ten years, each one just as good as, if not better than, the last. “MASSEDUCTION” is the notoriously private alternative rocker’s most personal album yet. Her signature guitar, assisted by delightful electro-pop production, shines on the tracks “Los Ageless” and “Masseduction,” but St. Vincent proves herself again to be so much more than a one-trick pony. Her sorrowfully sweet piano ballad “New York” and the haunting farewell of “Slow Disco” draw attention to her softer side — which is front and center on her acoustic re-imagining and re-release of the same album dubbed “MassEducation." St. Vincent took home the top alternative prize for her self-titled album in 2015 and it’s hard to imagine her leaving Sunday’s ceremony without taking home another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“A transformational college experience… [is] rooted in the ideal of intellectual exploration, in the pursuit of connecting with people who are different from you and learning from them, and in the process of reflecting on what you've learned and deciding what kind of person you want to be.”
So spoke then-newly-appointed Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in Sept. 2014, as he sought to establish guiding principles upon which to base his coming deanship. But since proclaiming his mission as such, Khurana has continuously failed to uphold this promise of individual freedom to grow, to reflect, and most importantly, to decide. The sanctions policy regarding single-gender social organizations, which restricts the autonomy of students in choosing their associations, is evidence of just that.
Now, as Harvard struggles to define itself in a new social age, exemplified by the Stand Up to Harvard movement, the dissonance of Rakesh Khurana and his fellow administrators regarding the single-gender social group policy must come to an end. By moving to phase out social organizations which for centuries have had a formidable presence on Harvard's campus, the University strikes out against the very principles which it claims to herald.
No longer may sororities serve as safe spaces for the women within; no longer may a diversity of thought differing from the Cambridge norm prosper; no longer may bonds of camaraderie and friendship develop without the interfering hands of those fearful of personal freedoms.
To claim that single-gender organizations are wholly free of harm would be foolish. Yet the same issues which the University claims to address through the shuttering of these groups will exist regardless of these measures. Proponents of the phasing out of so-called discriminatory social clubs cite problems which prevail across society, seeking to pinpoint blame on these select institutions. Sexual assault is a real, threatening issue, but restricting all single-gender social organizations is not the solution. In reality, all-male final clubs and fraternities simply suffer from the same issues of assault as do all campuses nationwide. Forcing change does naught but eliminate the opportunity to address those problems head-on.
By punishing women seeking safe spaces in Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, or Kappa Kappa Gamma, Harvard makes evident discrepancy in and failure of reasoning. Can sexual assault be the justification for a forced closure of sororities? Alternatively, does a policy that forces the closure of female-only spaces really combat sexual assault?
The answer is no, and the notion that such a conclusion may be defended is ridiculous. This facade of progressiveness put forth by Khurana thus collapses when scrutinized more deeply. In reality, the policy doesn’t help women at all.
Finally, such radical action against those participating in organizations external from the University, restricting fellowship availability and forbidding club officership, runs counter to higher education's purpose: the free exploration of thought. By restricting students’ right to freedom of association, Harvard is limiting their ability to truly choose their transformative experience.
Where does it end? There's a fine line once individual freedoms begin to be suppressed. Why should Harvard, which claims to curate the highest caliber of students, dictate their lives outside campus?
In 2016, former University President Drew G. Faust declared to then-graduating seniors that "telling your own story, a fresh story, full of possibility and a new order of things, is the task of every generation, and the task before you," echoing promises of intellectual exploration by Khurana.
This promised liberty of choosing one’s own path is made hollow by such obstructions to individual actions. And the ability of students to craft their own narratives freely could only become more limited should Harvard act similarly in related situations. This abstraction of discrimination can be made applicable to any comping process, to any niche student group, to any non-fully-inclusive student gatherings. And that’s frightening.
Although the debate over single-gender social organizations may seem to have subsided, the actions of the University continue to threaten the individual freedoms of the student body and must be countered with an equally fair argument. To stand idly as the promises of higher education, of the enrichment of the mind and of thought, are violated, constitutes a disservice. Students must continue to speak out. And if Harvard is to remain at the forefront of higher education, the University must respond by changing the policy and choosing to uphold the underlying principles of Veritas abandoned by Khurana — of truth and student freedom of self-determination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have distinct memories from my childhood of resolutions to speak up in class and social settings. Most years, I failed. My shyness kept me tame as I got all my work done in silence. Each year I tried to increase my volume, but found myself closing back into myself when people talked over me, or even took credit for my work.
Gloria Anzaldúa speaks on her own experiences as people tried to stifle her voice as a lesbian Chicana. They tried to tame her wild tongue. The pressures around me did the same. I found it was too much effort to try to speak up. If I didn’t say anything, I couldn’t be ignored. My shyness stuck with me as part of my personality as I limited my words to close friends and need-based situations.
I knew I had things to share in my head, but it took me a while to arrive to the point where I could bring those thoughts out into the open. The impetus to do so presented itself in small instances, mainly in predominantly white classes in high school. I remember a white classmate claiming racism wasn’t prevalent because she didn’t see accounts in the news. That day I felt a need to speak up, even though my voice quaked the entire time. Because of instances like this, I found that if you put the tongue in places where it has to speak up for the identities of its owner, a duty to speak arises.
As the years went by, I found more need for my voice as I got involved in matters I cared about. I got involved in organizations at my school and in my community, building up knowledge and forming connections. It was in those spaces that I found I had unique experiences that needed to be shared. I learned that others were going through similar struggles.
Bit by bit, I took leadership positions that pushed me out of my comfort zone and surprised me. I spoke, and people listened. I found the things I had to say mattered. More importantly, I saw people who looked like me speaking up, teaching me that I, too, deserved to take up space.
As I trained my wild tongue, I learned that being ignored was only one of many responses to what I had to say. There was also praise and appreciation. But there was also criticism that stemmed from ignorance. I learned this after I came out as a proud undocumented and unafraid Latina in my high school graduation speech and presented my resilience alongside my struggles. I was bombarded by media sources trying to report on my story.
Through that experience, I learned that my voice carried power. I learned that my voice could be threatening. The negative comments that came from strangers and people I had grown up with sent the message, loud and clear, that they didn’t want me speaking. I had internalized my silence for so long as something that was wrong with me, not a result of various factors out of my control. I had to learn that my voice is tied to my humanity.
In the midst of the political tide that was taking over America, I felt the need for my voice more than ever because my humanity was being brought into question. I spoke out because I had to. I felt the urgency and got involved in new ways once I got to Harvard. I joined The Crimson because of this urgency. During my first editorial board meeting, we voted against making Harvard a sanctuary campus. The majority opinion felt like a direct attack after I introduced myself as the only undocumented student in the room. That day, I wrote my first dissent with two other students. Several more have followed since then.
Writing became a new way for me to share my voice that I hadn’t known in high school. I published more pieces and took on a column my sophomore spring. Writing became empowering and allowed me to share my voice openly.
But writing comes with its own set of difficulties when done in such a public setting. With writing comes a lot of vulnerability as you put yourself out there and open yourself up to criticism or negativity from the comments section. Writing also requires motivation to begin the process.
This past semester, I’ve found little motivation to write because of my mental health and another wave of imposter syndrome as I look to academia for my future path. Keeping in mind all the work I’ve done to train my tongue, here is the reason I am writing this column: Writing is scary, but it has also become a form of resistance. Spots at the table are not handed to me. I must keep pushing for my voice to be heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A partnership between Uber and emergency response-focused startup RapidSOS has led to the recent implementation of a “911 Assistance” feature on the popular ride-sharing app. This feature, included in the app’s new Safety Toolkit, enables users in Cambridge to contact police without exiting the app, giving emergency responders earlier warning in the event of any security issues.
We welcome this feature to make ride-sharing more secure for Cambridge residents and college students across the city, and we hope that it will serve as a deterrent for potential safety issues raised while using the app. The ability to establish a direct line of communication with Cambridge authorities during the course of an Uber ride is a vital move in the direction of greater safety. Both deterrence of crime and increased response time to a safety concern will make Cambridge a safer place.
We have previously encouraged the improvement of safety and the prioritization of user protection in ride-sharing applications, and we are heartened that Uber has incorporated such measures into its interface. This decision demonstrates the company’s commitment to improve user security.
While the “911 Assistance” feature represents solid progress on ensuring security for Uber riders, the infrastructure surrounding data privacy associated with the feature must be a top priority for its creators. The feature allows riders to share information such as location and trip details within the app, and such information may be exposed to potentially damaging leaks. Such a security breach would not be unprecedented, as Uber recently had to pay a $148 million settlement in the aftermath of a data breach that exposed the information of 57 million of its drivers and riders.
In that case, Uber’s approach to the incident — covering up the breach by paying off the hacker, which led to the firing of two employees a year later — was concerning to say the least, and does not bode well for the company’s behavior in the event of future breaches. In order for this feature to be effective, Uber must win riders’ trust enough for them to provide this sensitive data. That requires that they be diligent in working for better security, along with being transparent about and willing to take responsibility for any breaches that may arise.
The physical safety of users must certainly be a priority for Uber, but so should their safety on the web and the privacy of their data. One cannot be sacrificed for the other, and ride sharing companies have the obligation to ensure both realms of safety. Finally, if the implementation of this feature in Cambridge is successful, Uber and other local police departments should expand the feature both to different ride-sharing apps and to other cities so that as many people as possible can enjoy safer rides.

Correction: Feb. 11, 2019
A previous version of this staff editorial incorrectly stated that the "911 Assistance" feature automatically sends medical or emergency contact information to the emergency responders. In fact, only location and trip details are sent to authorities upon deployment of the Uber feature.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’ Office of Diversity and Minority Affairs recently hired two new Diversity and Inclusion Fellows, according to a press release Monday morning.
New fellows Xavier J. du Maine and Andrew N. Westover will join current fellow Alyssa M. Hernandez in the fellowship program created last spring in an effort to strengthen ties between the GSAS administration and its students. The inaugural fellows, Hernandez and Alfredo M. Valencia, have said they applied for the positions to create a more welcoming community within GSAS, specifically focusing on increasing representation of minority communities.
Following Hernandez and Valencia’s appointments, the school faced demand for a third BGLTQ-focused Fellow after BGLTQ@GSAS sent messages to administrators and posted on social media calling for more BGLTQ-oriented resources and support.
Du Maine and Westover said they hope to carry on their forerunners’ torch and expand the scope of the fellows’ mission at GSAS.
Du Maine, a Ph.D. student in biological and biomedical sciences who identifies as a student of color, is replacing Valencia’s position after Valencia stepped down at the close of last semester. Du Maine said that upon arriving at Harvard, his expectations for Harvard graduate student life flipped on their head: Rather than struggle with a challenging academic environment, du Maine immediately found himself face-to-face with isolation and emotional strain. As an underrepresented student, du Maine wrestled to find a community at GSAS, according to the press release.
Despite his difficulties with graduate student life, du Maine said his appointment offers him the chance to shape the culture at GSAS into something more welcoming.
“I applied to be a GSAS diversity and inclusion fellow because I want to help create a culture in which underrepresented students in GSAS can thrive and flourish in graduate school and not just survive,” du Maine said in the release. “Being a fellow allows me to serve, support, and advocate for underrepresented students in GSAS, which is an honor and a privilege.”
Westover’s appointment fulfills the office's promise to appoint a BGLTQ-focused Fellow. A Ph.D. student in education, Westover said he will work to “assess the needs of the LGBTQ community and provide a bridge between LGBTQ students, the revitalized LGBTQ@GSAS student group, and the administration,” according to the release.
Westover said he sought the fellowship as a strong believer in the necessity of communal support.
“I hope to learn more about the needs and desires of LGBTQ+ students across GSAS’s programs,” Westover said in the release. “We are already thinking about ways to establish stronger lines of communication and support.”
GSAS Dean Emma Dench, who recently announced the launch of a long-term initiative to improve advising at GSAS, also shared her thoughts on the Fellows’ role in shaping GSAS in the release.
“I am delighted that GSAS now has three diversity and inclusion fellows tasked with student outreach,” Dench said in the press release. “The connections they make and the information they gather will be crucial as we determine how best to enhance support for our diversity and inclusion efforts.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council elected 14 new representatives across eight upperclassmen houses in midterm elections held last week, according to UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20.
Thirty-four candidates ran for 14 open positions on the Council, but some students who won elections were write-in candidates on the ballot. The Council was not able to declare a winner in one contest, in Cabot House, because the election ended in a tie.
Nine students — excluding write-in candidates — originally ran for positions in seven houses. Only the Lowell House midterm election, which had two students running for one open position, was competitive.
Last week’s election — which lasted from Monday to Thursday and saw 154 students cast ballots — marked the lowest voter turnout in midterm elections in recent years. 371 undergraduates voted in the 2018 UC midterms, and 402 students cast votes in 2017.
Brandon M. Martinez ’20, a write-in candidate selected to represent Cabot House, said he feels a responsibility to serve after his election.
“Ultimately, I thought it was only right for me, one, to recognize that people thought I should step into the position and serve and not take that lightly, and two, that I could move with some of my ideas on through this semester,” he said.
Martinez was not the only write-in candidate chosen for the Council. Delaney E. Tevis ’19 and Humza I. Jilani ’21 tied in an election, and Tevis ultimately accepted a spot to represent Winthrop House.
JingJing Z. Zhu ’19, who also received two write-in votes in the Winthrop election, wrote in email that she did not intend to pursue a UC position.
“I do not intend on nor have I ever intended on pursuing a UC position,” Zhu wrote.
Samyra C. Miller ’21, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for UC vice president along with Daniel “Danny” K. Ragheb ’20 last year, secured a vacant seat to represent Lowell House. Though she did not win the vice presidency, she said she still “wanted to make change” in the UC.
“As an electoral representative, I really do hope to not only work with the current UC initiatives, but also push for better access to social spaces on campus,” Miller said.
Jakob L. Gilbert ’21 — an Eliot House representative who worked on Ragheb and Miller’s campaign last year — said he wants to change the perception of the UC he had encountered during the fall elections. Gilbert is one of the nine candidates elected who were not write-ins.
“I saw how it was generally accepted that the UC is not capable of much and the student body generally viewed the UC as a joke, and I thought that was pretty depressing,” Gilbert said.
Palaniappan wrote that she acknowledges “this is a common sentiment shared by individuals on our campus.”
“From my perspective as a member of the UC over the past three years, I have directly witnessed the impact of the UC on improving various elements of student life,” she wrote. “For me, the UC has felt like an effective body and outlet for representatives to advocate on behalf of students and create meaningful change.”
She wrote that the UC's restructuring is designed to "help the UC function in the most effective and representative way possible."
The election commission has yet to decide the date of the runoff election for the vacancy in Cabot House.
The newly elected Council members are as follows:
Adams House
Nicholas Beasley ’20
Allison S. Chang ’19
Daniel J. Inge ’20
Cabot House
Brandon M. Martinez ’20
Currier House
Christopher M. Fechisin ’21
Eliot House
Jakob L. Gilbert ’21
Leverett House
Kanishk A. Mittal ’20
Isaac A. Walker ’19
Lowell House
Samyra C. Miller ’21
Pforzheimer House
Clifford S. Courvoisier ’20
Athena W. Kan ’19
Winthrop House
Shivani R. Aggarwal ’21
Delaney E. Tevis '19
Correction: Feb. 20, 2019
Due to incorrect information given to The Crimson by UC Vice President Julia M. Huesa, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Delaney E. Tevis declined to participate in a runoff election, leaving a vacancy on the Council. In fact, Tevis accepted the seat, so a runoff election was not necessary. 
Correction: Feb. 20, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that JingJing Z. Zhu received one write-in vote and declined to take a spot to represent Winthrop House. In fact, Zhu received two write-in votes and never received an offer to represent Winthrop House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 45 alumni, students, and community members gathered inside the Phillips Brooks House parlor room on Saturday to discuss the polarization of the media during a roundtable event hosted by the Harvard Alumni for Global Women’s Empowerment.
Harvard GlobalWE, a shared interest group of the Harvard Alumni Association, raises awareness of issues concerning women’s rights and freedoms worldwide.
Sajida H. Shroff — the discussion facilitator and president of Harvard GlobalWE — said the annual event began last year in response to the #MeToo movement, a social movement in which women have shared their experiences in dealing with sexual harassment. This year’s theme focused on how women are reshaping a divided media.
“The goal, for today, was to get people to understand that you have to look beyond the surface of when you get some information and you have to think about where it’s coming from, who it’s coming from, why it’s coming from them,” Shroff said in an interview after the event.
The event’s guest speaker, Annafi Wahed, co-founded the Flip Side, which curates a daily newsletter for subscribers featuring articles from both left- and right-leaning sources. Wahed was joined by Allison L. Pillinger Choi ’06 and Angela Cho, both Flip Side board members. Shroff said in the interview that Harvard GlobalWE chose to feature the Flip Side because the company presents “both sides of an argument in a way that lets you then make the educated decision.”
Pillinger Choi said during the discussion that she experienced the effect of political polarization as a conservative undergraduate on Harvard’s campus.
“I learned very quickly that it was not good, not cool, to be right of center on campus,” Pillinger Choi said. “I laid low, I did not join the IOP, I did other things, but I think that that is part of the reason why… we are at this place we are today in the world.”
“I think I was part of the problem by not speaking out,” she added.
The roundtable conversation stressed the importance of considering the way media outlets may write stories to fit a desired framework. Wahed said this was particularly the case with women’s issues.
“First of all, women are 52 percent of the global population. When we talk about women's issues — healthcare is a women’s issue, affordable housing is a women’s issue, taxes are a women’s issue,” Wahed said. “The way we frame the issue matters.”
Pillinger Choi added that there is a “big opportunity for women to get involved” in the media, especially at the grassroots level.
Attendees said they enjoyed hearing about the importance of bipartisanship understanding in advancing political change.
“I found that it was very enriching to hear the bipartisan perspective and lean about how there are active steps that are being made to engage both sides of the spectrum and working towards a rich and fulfilling future, really,” Skye R. Regan, an attendee, said in an interview after the event.
Participants were given handouts from the speakers detailing statistics on media polarization and recommended resources to continue the conversation.
“I think directly after the talk, I was a little bit confused because ultimately each news organization has to make a profit they have to sort of like target people and advertise to them, but then ultimately I think the mission of Flip Side is moving in the right direction,” Sofia M. Zoullas ’19 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and administrators representing 35 colleges and universities from across the country convened at Harvard Kennedy School this past weekend to attend the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement hosted by the Institute of Politics.
The conference featured several speakers who have worked to increase voting and political mobilization among young people, including March for Our Lives organizers Edna Chavez, Ryan Deitsch, David Hogg, and Tyah Roberts, who were awarded the John F. Kennedy New Frontier Award at the conference on Friday.
The award honors “Americans under the age of 40 who are changing their communities and the country with their commitment to public service,” according to the John F. Kennedy Library website.
Chair of the National Campaign Committee Kenneth ‘Taylor” Whitsell ’21 said this year’s conference was aimed at looking at patterns and results from the 2018 election and possible applications for 2020.
“We have panels, town hall sessions, time for students to work on different projects related to voter engagement,” he said. “This year our main focus is figuring out what worked in 2018 on our campus, that involves the Harvard Votes challenge, how we’re tackling barriers to democracy across the nation, and steps we can take to ensure students turn out to vote in 2020.”
The IOP also partnered with When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement organization launched in July 2018 by Michelle Obama and six co-chairs: Chris Paul, Tom Hanks, Janelle Monae, Faith Hill, Tim Mcgraw, and Lin-Manuel Miranda.
When We All Vote CEO Kyle Lierman said in an interview at the conference that the organization looked at voting trends among historically underrepresented groups including African Americans, Latinx, and young Americans.
“They just don’t vote at the same rate as older Americans, so we put extra time and effort into making sure they knew how to register, knew the process of voting, and understood the value and importance of their vote,” Lierman said.
Members of National Campaign Committee and When We All Vote stressed the importance of maintaining energy and mobilization, even in off-years like 2019.
“One inspiration for the conference was thinking about how we engage voters all the time, not just in election years,” Whitsell said.
Throughout the weekend, When We All Vote led workshops on addressing barriers to voting on campus during the conference. One panel included Stevie Valles, executive director of Chicago Votes, and a group of students who had led initiatives to address structural barriers to voting, like gerrymandering and voter suppression on their campuses.
Lierman said the benefit of an intercollegiate conference is to highlight and exchange ideas of students across the country. He pointed to Northwestern University, where 97 percent of students are registered to vote and voter turnout reached over 64 percent in 2016.
“How can everyone else steal those ideas and plans that Northwestern did, and other campuses that have been doing a good job, and continue to organize more and more campuses to take those best practices and implement them across the country?” Lierman said.
Lierman said this exchange of insights is what attracted students from other schools to come to the conference.
“We came in looking for constructive ideas to help bolster our infrastructure in accomplishing these goals and learning about ways to reach higher and do better in our mission, and that’s exactly what we found,” Stephen A. Cromwell, a representative from the University of Oklahoma, said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted unanimously to alter its committee system at its general meeting Sunday, changing some of the organizational structures that have governed the body since its establishment.
The Council’s changes, enacted through one constitutional amendment and one change to the group’s bylaws, will reshape how the UC determines which members work on various issues.
The UC has historically comprised an executive board and six standing committees, each given a different set of responsibilities. UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20 proposed changes to the Council’s rules in order to dissolve the Student Life, Student Initiatives, and Student Relations committees. The newly established Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee; Social and Residential Life Committee; and communications team will take over most of the dissolved groups' responsibilities.
“A lot of these changes have to do with things that have never been changed in the Constitution since the UC was created in 1982,” Palaniappan said. “This is one of the biggest changes that we’ve ever seen on the UC, because it changes fundamentally how we are operating and what are the structures that we have in place to facilitate the work that we are doing.”
Palaniappan and Huesa proposed the changes in order to clarify the roles of each committee and to allow the UC to run more effectively, they said.
“Some of the committee titles have been overly broad, so we were really hoping to create committees that have defined names specific to the initiatives that we are seeking to work on,” Palaniappan said.
Under the new system, the Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee will oversee the UC’s work relating to physical and mental health, sexual violence prevention and response, student safety, and spiritual life. The Social and Residential Life Committee will strive to improve aspects of students’ experiences in dorms and the upperclassmen houses, and will oversee the Council’s work on social spaces, dining services, transportation, and storage, according to Palaniappan.
Sunday’s changes to the UC’s rules also established a group of communications directors who will serve on the communications team in addition to their primary roles on other committees. Previously, UC representatives on the Student Relations Committee — the communication team’s predecessor — typically did not hold other positions.
“If you were a Student Relations Committee member, you wouldn’t necessarily have to be a member of another committee, and that didn’t really make sense because we were supposed to be publicizing the work that other committees were doing,” Huesa said.
Many UC representatives said they hope the new committee structure will allow them to take on projects more effectively.
“I think having these committees that are entirely focused on exactly what students want to do is going to be a way for the UC to achieve a lot more good publicity and for us to do a lot more,” UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, a former sports chair of The Crimson, said.
Palaniappan and Huesa’s amendment retained the Finance, Education, and First-Year Class committees, though Dunster House Representative Gevin B. Reynolds ’19 proposed an amendment during Sunday’s meeting to rebrand the Education Committee as the Academic Life Committee. He said he believes the committee’s current name is too broad.
“The title ‘Education Committee’ encapsulates everything that goes into your experience here at Harvard,” Reynolds said. “Changing it to ‘Academic Life Committee’ is more narrow and more specific to what sets the committee apart from the other ones.”
The UC unanimously accepted Reynold’s amendment.
The Council will hold internal elections for the chairs of the Health, Safety, and Wellness Committee and the Social and Residential Life Committee in the coming weeks. Current representatives will be eligible to apply for the communications directors positions, and Palaniappan and Huesa will select five communications directors from the pool of applicants.
“We hope that this will be one of the most significant changes to the Council structure that will really allow a sustainable way for the Council to effectively run for decades,” Palaniappan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 50 Harvard students gathered outside the Charles Hotel Friday afternoon to demand the University create a formalized ethnic studies program.
The Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, which comprises affiliates across the University, organized the event, dubbed “The 47-Year Fight: Student Rally for Ethnic Studies.” Students specifically chose to congregate at noon to attract the attention of alumni and administrators — including University President Lawrence S. Bacow — attending the Alumni Leadership Conference luncheon which took place in the Charles Hotel at the same time.
Jeannie Park ’83, a Coalition member and president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, said she hoped that holding the event at the same time as the alumni conference would encourage alumni to help publicize the need for a formalized ethnic studies program.
“When I tell other alumni who aren’t paying as close attention, people are honestly stunned. 'Really? There’s no ethnic studies at Harvard?' It kind of blows their mind,” Park said. “It’s so important for the administration to hear from all constituencies, not just students, not just alumni, not just faculty.”
Prior to his speech at the conference and the start of the rally, Bacow paused outside the Charles Hotel to converse with students.
James L. Walkingstick ’21 opened the rally with a prayer in his traditional language of Cherokee to bless the cause.
Several students read passages from University and Crimson archives, including letters penned by activists dating back to 1985. They also read past Crimson articles about historical developments in the fight for a formalized ethnic studies program.
Speakers also shared personal stories about grappling with their ethnic identities and the mentorship they have received from Harvard faculty members who teach ethnic studies courses.
Sally Chen ’19 spoke about her thesis advisor, Assistant History Professor Genevieve A. Clutario, praising Clutario’s course HIST 1013: “Introduction to Asian American History” specifically.
“Asian-American Studies was like taking a breath for the first time,” Chen said.
Clutario, who researches Asian-American history from a transnational perspective, recently accepted a position at Wellesley College. Her impending departure, along with the University’s decision not to put Associate Professor of Education Natasha K. Warikoo up for tenure, attracted sharp criticism last week.
The Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, and the Coalition For A Diverse Harvard each penned letters to Bacow denouncing the imminent loss of Clutario and Warikoo, who constituted two of three Harvard professors who study Asian-American studies.
Rally participants pointed out that many of Harvard’s peer universities — including Stanford University and Yale University — have already established their own ethnic studies programs.
Harvard currently offers an Ethnicity, Migration, Rights secondary and an Ethnic Studies field of study within the History and Literature concentration. Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in an October interview that FAS is conducting searches for faculty specializing in ethnic studies and that she plans to meet with advocates this semester.
Chen said at the rally that Harvard must demonstrate its commitment to diverse curricula now, especially as the University faces a lawsuit alleging discrimination against Asian-American applicants to the College.
“It’s imperative that we defend diversity in admissions, but it’s not enough to worry about who the school admits,” said Chen, who was one of several students to testify in court on behalf of Harvard in October. “We have to ensure also that students are supported and well-equipped to thrive when they arrive on campus.”
Several rally attendees said the push for a formalized ethnic studies program had deep personal importance to them.
“Having ethnic studies symbolizes that our histories are important. They are valid, and they are worth learning,” Tajrean Rahman ’20 said in an interview.
“I feel that if our history, if it’s not learned by everybody, then who are we?” Walkingstick said in an interview. “It’s been erased for the past 400 years for Native Americans, and it’s going to continue to be underrepresented if Harvard’s not doing its part.”
As students chanted “Out of the Courtroom! Into the Class!” outside of the hotel, several alumni joined the group to show their support or just to listen.
“I’ve had deep ties to the university since I’ve been an undergrad — over 30 years. I remember even back then that this was an issue,” Douglas H. Chin ’88 said. “It surprises me that although we’ve made progress, we still don’t have an ethnic studies department.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tufts lecturer and Harvard Business School graduate Kaiser K. Fung, 45, was arrested for surreptitiously photographing a Harvard affiliate in the men’s locker room showers at Blodgett Pool last week.
At about 6 p.m. Tuesday, the alleged victim saw Fung “walking laps” around the open showering area of the locker room, behavior he described to Harvard University Police Department responders as “suspicious,” according to the incident report.
As the affiliate showered, Fung “stood under” a nearby shower and held a phone “pointing directly” at him, according to the report. Once Fung noticed the affiliate had seen him, the affiliate said Fung turned the phone away, and the affiliate could see the “screen of the phone was clearly on the camera’s feature.”
Andrea M. Lapointe, Harvard’s Assistant Director of Athletics, said the University is committed to safety in its athletics facilities and responded quickly to the incident.
“The safety of our members and guests is the number one priority at all of our recreational facilities. Upon learning of this incident at Blodgett Pool, per protocol the Harvard University Police Department was contacted immediately,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
While being questioned by HUPD officers, Fung misidentified himself and repeatedly apologized, but did not directly acknowledge he had photographed the affiliate. Fung told officers that “he likes to take pictures, but he hadn’t taken any pictures today,” according to the report.
“He kept stating that he was sorry and that he ‘wouldn’t do it again’,” the incident report reads. “Mr. Fung further stated, ‘I promise to delete everything’, while stating he was sorry over and over again.”
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment about the incident, citing HUPD’s policy not to discuss ongoing criminal trials.
Fung was placed under arrest for “photographing, videotaping, or electronically surveilling partially nude or nude person,” a violation of Chapter 272 Section 105 B of Massachusetts’ general laws, according to the incident report.
If found guilty, Fung could face up to two and a half years in prison, a fine of no more than $5,000, or both.
Fung did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Fung is a lecturer at the Gordon Institute, Tufts University’s engineering school. He previously taught courses at Columbia University and New York University.
At an arraignment Wednesday, Fung was released from police custody on personal recognizance to await trial. A hearing is scheduled for Mar. 28. Fung was issued a trespassing warning for all Harvard property as part of the terms of his release, according to the criminal docket.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Hasty Pudding Theatricals honored actor, director, and producer Milo Ventimiglia, the group’s 2019 Man of the Year, before the premiere of its newest production Friday evening.
The Man of the Year festivities included a celebratory roast of Ventimiglia and the presentation of the Pudding Pot — the award given to Man of the Year and Woman of the Year honorees — on the Farkas Hall Stage.
Each year, the Pudding bestows the title of Man of the Year and Woman of the Year on “performers who have made lasting and impressive contributions to the world of entertainment.” Bryce Dallas Howard, the 2019 Woman of the Year recipient, was honored with a parade and celebratory roast last week.
After a press conference, Ventimiglia attended the first performance of “France! France! Revolution,” the Pudding’s 2019 musical production.
That first performance marked a historic moment for the 171-year-old theater troupe. After more than 150 years of putting on shows with all-male casts, the Pudding announced last winter that it would start including female students in its productions come 2019. Women were previously limited the troupe's business, tech, and design boards.
Ventimiglia praised the Pudding in a press conference Friday for admitting women to its cast.
“It’s absolutely the right thing to do, it’s the greatest thing to do, because the heart of the artist isn’t only in one person, one type of person, one way of being — it’s really in all of us,” he said.
He said the Pudding made the correct choice to “really just stand up and say, ‘Hey we’re doing this regardless of tradition or history or anything.’”
Before the roast, Chairman of the Hasty Pudding Institute Andrew L. Farkas ’82 welcomed University President Lawrence S. Bacow, who attended the performance with his wife Adele. Bacow is the first University president to attend the premiere of a Pudding production.
Farkas said in his speech that Sunday’s performance would make history.
“First and foremost I want to acknowledge everything that you all have acknowledged, that we are going to enjoy for the very first time women in our cast,” he said. “Let me try that one more time — women in our cast!”
His comments about female cast members drew cheers from the audience.
Pudding producers Elizabeth C. Mann ’20 and Mariana C. Sanchez ’20 led the celebratory roast of Ventimiglia. Three of the six women cast in this year’s production also participated as characters in the roast.
Jokes ranged from comments on the actor’s early career roles to his status as the sexiest vegetarian alive, as determined by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
Before he received his award, members of the Pudding made him sing “Big Girls Don’t Cry” — an allusion to his role in Fergie’s music video for the song — and rap the entire theme song of “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.”
Ventimiglia said in the press conference that he feels “overwhelmed” and “a little speechless” to receive the award.
“I’m grateful and honored to be given this by the future of entertainment — really the future of the world,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Edward J. Markey (D-MA) answered questions about the “Green New Deal” — a plan he introduced in Congress with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14) to combat economic inequality and climate change — at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics Friday.
In a talk with Caroline B. Kennedy ‘80, who served as the United States Ambassador to Japan from 2013 to 2017, Markey discussed his proposal to transition the United States to a sustainable environment and equitable economy.
“What Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and I decided to do is we would put together a 10-year plan to mobilize this country to be able to deal with the issue and to call for a goal of 100 percent renewable clean energy,” Markey said.
The Green New Deal faces criticism from Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump, who mocked the proposal on Twitter Saturday. Markey said garnering nationwide support for the legislation will require a grassroots approach.
“Our goal is to create a national movement in every city and town across this country to pass the laws in the House and Senate signed by president Trump in 2019 and 2020,” Markey said. “If not, we’re going to turn this into a voting issue in the 2020 elections.”
Markey said he is confident opponents of the Green New Deal will be voted out of office in upcoming elections.
“Either they change the legislation — which is highly unlikely — or we change them, and they’re out of office,” he said.
When asked about the prospective role of nuclear energy in the Green New Deal, Markey said that though nuclear energy could meet environmental guidelines, it is unlikely to play a large role from an economic standpoint.
“If there is a fully competitive marketplace then I believe wind and solar efficiency — and geothermal — are going to win,” Markey said.
Among the audience were student representatives from colleges and universities across the country who were partaking in the IOP’s annual National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement conference.
“I hope everyone will go back to your campuses and share the Senator’s plan,” Kennedy said to the visiting students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard earned its second consecutive road split this weekend, falling to Columbia in disappointing fashion before outlasting Cornell the following night. Each game was defined by its first quarter. The Crimson was outscored 22-2 and shot 1-of-17 in a brutal opening stanza in Morningside Heights and then hit five threes in a dominant 25-13 opening period in Ithaca, N.Y.,.
HARVARD 68, CORNELL 61
After a tough loss to Columbia, Harvard (11-8, 4-2 Ivy) knew it would have to come out strong against a scrappy Cornell (7-10, 1-5) team if it wanted to remain within shouting distance of Ivy League leading Penn. And it did just that, turning the Big Red over six times in the first quarter and jumping out to an early 13-2 lead before using its sizable height advantage to wear down Cornell late.
“I think we just had the mindset of coming out really aggressive,” co-captain guard Madeline Raster said. “We went down 22-2 in the first quarter of the Columbia game so we felt like we had to make up for that by coming back really strong in the first quarter and playing really well in the Cornell game.”
As she so often has this season, junior guard Katie Benzan set the tone for the Crimson early, scoring eight of her team-high 20 points in the first quarter and spearheading a tremendous passing quarter in which Harvard assisted on eight of its nine baskets.
“We realized that if we want to reach our goal of an Ivy League championship then we have to take care of business against Cornell,” Benzan said. “We lost that opportunity to take care of business against Columbia and that was disappointing, frustrating, but our goals are still in reach so we left that disappointment behind and we just went out on the court against Cornell hungry for a win.”
After its quick start, the Crimson struggled to maintain its ball movement and the free-flowing offense that spurred the first quarter production. Harvard managed just five total assists and 43 points in the last three quarters and lost all three quarters to the hometown Big Red.
It appeared late in the game that — as it so often does — the nearly four hour bus ride from New York City had taken a toll on the Crimson. In the fourth quarter, Harvard shot just 3-of-14 and 1-of-8 from three point range. But the Crimson played well enough defensively to hold Cornell at arm’s length and led by at least eight points until just five seconds remained.
“Shooting better [against Cornell] definitely helped,” Benzan said, “but I think it was more of a mentality thing that we weren’t going to accept anything but a win that night and so we went out there and just threw the first punch and then kept throwing the punch and just never took our foot off the peddle. We were very relentless.”
Three Harvard starters, sophomore forward Jadyn Bush, junior forward Jeannie Boehm, and Raster, fouled out Saturday. But none of the three was in much foul trouble until the fourth quarter, when the game was all but decided. They entered the fourth with three, two, and two fouls respectively, and all three played their normal allotment of minutes for the Crimson.
Junior forward Laura Bagwell-Katalinich paced the Big Red with a career-high 25 points. Junior guard Samantha Widmann added 14 and was the only player in the game to play the full 40 minutes.
Also notable Saturday was that head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith chose to shuffle Harvard’s starting lineup in the aftermath of the disappointing defeat at Columbia. Senior guard Nani Redford, who had been one of the few bright spots for the Crimson on Friday, joined the lineup in place of co-captain Sydney Skinner, who played 15 minutes off the bench against Cornell.
COLUMBIA 75, HARVARD 65
Very rarely does a team lose a game in which it is as dominant on the boards as Harvard was against Columbia (6-13, 2-4) on Friday. The Crimson gobbled up 27 offensive rebounds and held the Lions to just eight, allowing Harvard to take 35 more shots than its opponents.
That is exactly what happened in Manhattan, though, as the Crimson fell behind early on and shot poorly enough (28%) to squander its rebounding dominance and the efforts of forwards Boehm and Bush, who both posted double-doubles and combined for 26 rebounds (16 of them offensive).
The shooting struggles Friday night were pervasive. Benzan, normally such a reliable shooter, scored just three points, making it her worst performance since the bloodbath at then-No. 1 Notre Dame that opened Harvard’s season. She combined with Raster and Skinner to shoot 6-of-38 from the field.
“They [Columbia] played a zone and they pressed us and they played really good defense,” Benzan said. “They made everyone’s shots difficult and they really strove to make everyone uncomfortable in what they usually do.”
The Crimson’s problems went beyond poor shooting. Harvard also got crushed at the free throw line, where it earned just seven free throw attempts on the night, of which it made three. Columbia, meanwhile, finished 24-of-27 from the line and set the tone early by going 9-of-9 from the charity stripe in the first quarter.
The Lions came into the weekend with three players averaging double-digit points per game. All three played very well against the Crimson, with sophomore guard Riley Casey leading the way with 23 points, freshman forward Sienna Durr contributing 22, and junior guard Janiya Clemmons adding 21.
“We just didn’t play our normal game and we have to focus more on coming back and playing great defense,” Raster said. “That’s something that’s key that we need to work on in terms of starting games strong. Just getting energy from our defense and not necessarily from our offense.”
After three straight road weekends in which Harvard went 3-2, the Crimson will finally return to Cambridge next week for its crucial homestand against conference favorites Penn and Princeton. Harvard will look to extend its eight game home winning streak in Ivy League play, a streak that extends back to the beginning of last year’s conference season.
“We love playing at home,” Benzan said, “and we feel that we play better at home with our home fans and all of that jazz so we are just very excited to be home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard entered the weekend riding a four-game unbeaten streak and playing its best hockey of the season. After cruising to victory against Union (4-24-2, 2-15-1 ECAC), the Crimson had to grind out a tight game against Rensselaer (12-13-5, 9-8-1) who, by at least one metric, has one of the best goalkeepers of all time. During the game against the Crimson, senior RPI goalie Lovisa Selander would set an NCAA Division I record 3,853 career saves.
By the end of the weekend, Harvard (10-11-3, 8-8-2) extended its unbeaten streak to six games, including five consecutive wins (5-0-1 since Jan. 26), to head into Tuesday’s Beanpot Championship to face the Boston University Terriers (16-6-7, 13-5-5 WHEA), who are running on a ten-game unbeaten streak of their own.
HARVARD 2, RENSSELAER 1
Harvard closed out pre-Beanpot Championship play with a grueling 2-1 win over Rensselaer that felt substantially closer than the 56-24 shot line. Considering freshman goalie Lindsay Reed and Selander both own a top-five save percentage in the country, though, the tight score made sense.
A late-season game against an ECAC team that sits just ahead of the Crimson in the conference standings meant coming out on top was an even higher priority than usual.
“This is a must-win game,” sophomore forward Becca Gilmore said. “We all knew RPI is ahead of us in the standings [and that] a win on Saturday would just go toward our goal in improving ourselves in the ECAC standings heading into playoffs.”
Harvard took to the ice against the Engineers with the same fire that has accompanied every game on the way to five consecutive wins. Ten minutes into the first, though, a penalty was called on the Crimson.
Down a player, Harvard battled fiercely, but offensive pressure from RPI brought a faceoff, a rebounding shot, a follow through, and a goal by the Engineers.
“Sometimes they’re going to get one, and they got one early on a powerplay,” Gilmore said. “You’ve just got to stay calm.”
After that initial goal, the Crimson’s defense buckled down. The score would remain 1-0 entering the second, but Harvard was on a net-peppering tear. Even the best goalies can only save so many.
“One thing we’ve emphasized, especially this past month, is just getting pucks to the net,” co-captain Kate Hallett said. “All shots are good shots, and the team has also been focused on having bodies in front of the net, screening their goalie, and looking for second chances on each shot.”
Seven minutes into the second, Gilmore found the puck on the RPI side of the ice.
“The puck was in the corner. Coach [Katey Stone] always says establish your lane, gain control of the puck,” Gilmore said. “Emma Buckles made a nice call for it, I slid it over to her, and the rest was just really good puck work by Buckles, and Jovo’s had the finishing touch lately, and just buried down.”
The score now knotted at one after sophomore forward Brooke Jovanovich’s fourth goal in three games, the Crimson refused to relax. Seven minutes later, Harvard struck again. An initial attempt rebounded and was quickly followed through by senior defender Kaitlin Tse, but Selander attempted to cover the puck.
Co-captain Lexie Laing was next to join in on the action. Suddenly, the puck squeezed out to the largely undefended backside of the net. Hallet was there for the shot, but it bounced off Selander’s skate. Another swipe by freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere, and the puck struck true.
The whole ordeal elapsed without a whistle-blow from the referee behind the net, but the Crimson’s dedication to ugly shots had paid off. By the time the puck found the net, at least four Engineers aside from Selander had passed through the crease, and more than ten seconds had elapsed since the initial shot.
The rest of the match saw more shots, solid defense, and no score change. Harvard’s relentless, determined play had worked.
“Not every goal is going to be really pretty,” Hallett said. “If we work harder than the other team in front of the net, ultimately we’re going to end up with more pucks in the net.”
HARVARD 5, UNION 1
The Crimson would show perhaps its most balanced scoring attack of the season against Union College, as 12 different players found the score sheet. Not only did Harvard score often, but the squad would find the back of the net early as well, netting three goals in the first and a fourth early in the second to the put game out of reach for the Dutchwomen.
“In the past, we have struggled to score, [but] in the last few games, everyone is on their game and burying pucks,” Gilmore said. “To have 12 different people score is definitely a confidence builder to show we have that depth…. That newly found confidence is going to be huge for us going forward.”
Capitalizing on the momentum of an exhilarating Beanpot semifinal win against No. 7/7 Boston College, the Crimson found the back of the net in the first half of the opening period as Della Rovere continued a knack for timely goals.
After receiving passes from junior forward Kat Hughes and freshman defender Maryna Macdonald, Della Rovere had earned a two-on-two rush. Despite the pass option to the slot, with Union junior goalie Kate Spooner off-angle, Della Rovere managed to sneak the puck inside the near post.
Wasting no time, the Crimson returned to the offensive. Sophomore defender Kate Glover centered the puck to Gilmore, who snapped a shot on net from between the faceoff dots. Spooner came up with the save and then another on the follow from Gilmore, but the third time was the charm for Harvard. Off the second Gilmore rebound, Jovanovich gained inside position before chipping a shot over Spooner’s pad for the 2-0 lead.
Continuing the scoring press, just over three minutes later, freshman defender Kyra Willoughby blasted a point shot wide. Collecting the carom off the end points, senior forward Bradley Fusco deftly slotted a backhand centering pass across the crease, which was deposited into the goal by freshman forward Anne Bloomer.
After closing the first with three goals in just over seven-minute, the Crimson quashed any hopes of a Union comeback with a short-handed tally from freshman forward Dominique Petrie. After the puck was pushed out into the neutral zone by Gilmore, Petrie grabbed the bouncing puck to spur herself on a breakaway, deking to the backhand side and sliding the puck five-hole.
Since coming together on the Feb. 1 matchup against Yale, the Harvard line that features Gilmore along with Petrie and Jovanovich has been on a tear. The combination has accounted for 21 points since the Yale game, with each player adding seven points apiece. Over the span, Gilmore seems to be the facilitator with seven assists, Jovanovich looks to be the finisher with five goals, and Petrie adds elements of both with three goals and four assists.
“We just had chemistry right off the bat,” said Gilmore. “I don’t think it matters whether it’s the Union defensemen, BC defensemen, or BU defensemen, or whatever. If you have chemistry, it’s going to click…. It’s so fun playing with Dom and Jovo, and I’m looking forward to what we can do Tuesday.”
Before the second intermission, sophomore forward Keely Moy would tip home a point shot from sophomore defender Sydney Sorkin to add a fifth for the Crimson. By the start of the third, Harvard’s scoring had come to an end, but the Dutchwomen would find the back of the net in the final frame with freshman forward Maia Martinez’s first career goal, setting the final at 5-1. In her fourth non-exhibition start of the season, junior goalie Beth Larcom contributed 22 saves with only one goal against. Despite the limited amount of starts, Larcom has now posted 108 saves on the 112 shots she’s faced. Freshman goalie Lindsay Reed, who has played the majority of the games, ranks top-five nationally in save percentage, giving Harvard one of the deepest goaltending cores in all of Division I.
Now, with just Tuesday’s Beanpot Championship at 8 p.m. at Bright-Landry Hockey Center and four ECAC games remaining, Harvard knows it must finish with urgency and tenacity.
“We know that each point right now matters,” Gilmore said. “It [was] a must-win on Friday, so I think there’s just a lot of energy and motivation just coming from the fact that we need these points. After the game on Tuesday [against Boston College], we played really well, so we just kind of took that energy and kept going.”

Game story to follow.
BOSTON, Mass. — The early game on the second Monday of February is the Beanpot contest no team wants to find itself in. After losing its semifinal last week, the Harvard men's hockey team (12-7-3, 9-5-2 ECAC) must take on Boston University (10-13-3, 8-7-2 Hockey East) in the tournament's consolation game.
But the No. 18/15 Crimson has more to play for than in a normal third-place matchup. A weekend conference win helped Harvard hang on to its ranked status, and a big victory tonight would go a long way for the Crimson's Pairwise standing. If the team wants to put itself in the best position possible to score a bid to the NCAA tournament, even the consolation game will be a must-win.

BOSTON, Mass. — The consolation game of Boston’s annual Beanpot Tournament usually struggles to inspire its participants. The majority of seats in TD Garden remain empty as two teams skate in a non-conference matchup for the undesired third place.
This year, however, the Harvard men’s hockey team did have something to play for — a silver lining to its disappointing semifinal defeat the week prior. Entering Monday night’s meeting with Boston University at 14th in the Pairwise rankings, the No. 18/15 Crimson was committed to improving its position on college hockey’s most telling scale.
Harvard (13-7-3, 9-5-2 ECAC) outplayed the Terriers (10-14-3, 8-7-2 Hockey East) to a 5-2 victory, walking away from the 2019 Beanpot with a third-place finish and keeping its at-large NCAA Tournament hopes alive.
“It can be a tough game to play in,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “However, as far as the Pairwise and the implications for your potential opportunities at the end of the season, it’s just as important as any other game…. I thought our guys came out, played a good, solid game.”
A pair of goals from junior forward Frédéric Grégoire, as well as two assists apiece for defensemen Reilly Walsh and John Marino, guided the Crimson to triumph.
During a stint of 4-on-4 hockey in the third period, Harvard broke out on an odd-man rush. Grégoire, receiving the puck from freshman defenseman Jack Rathbone, called his own number and ripped a wrist shot past the glove and right pad of rookie net-minder Vinnie Purpura. The center’s fifth of the season and second of the game would prove to be the deciding tally.
Grégoire’s first strike, also a wrist shot on the rush that somewhat surprised Purpura, established a 1-0 lead for his squad midway through the second frame. Grégoire’s two snipes on Monday continue a recent spell of strong play from the St. Lambert, Qué., native. In his last six games, he is averaging over a point per game (1.33) and has experienced success centering sophomore Jack Donato and co-captain Michael Floodstrand.
“What we may lack in marquee names up front, we have in depth,” coach Donato said. “That line has been really good…. Freddie has been excellent. He had a couple of good chances in the first two periods where we were really harping on him to shoot. It was nice to see him get a couple goals and be rewarded, because he does a lot of unselfish things.”
After Grégoire’s marksmanship broke open the score sheet, the Crimson found twine again four minutes before the period horn to assert a two-score advantage by the intermission.
Sophomore defenseman Reilly Walsh slid across the slot and, from his knees, zipped a pass through the net-front to a waiting Jack Badini. The forward made no mistake with the tap-in goal — Badini’s seventh of the campaign.
For Walsh, the highlight-reel helper marks the second such pass he has dished in the last week. In Friday’s 5-3 victory over No. 20 Union, Walsh set up freshman forward Casey Dornbach’s game-winning goal with a powerplay feed through an open seam. Walsh has pocketed five assists in his past three outings, including last Monday’s Beanpot semifinal loss to Boston College.
“I just made a move to the net, and I kind of fell,” Walsh recounted. “I heard Badini kind of yell, and so I just threw it across, and he made a good play to finish it. It was a nice play by all of us.”
Senior goaltender Michael Lackey (2 GA, .923 SV%) was building a shutout until early in the third period. BU junior Patrick Curry buried a puck from in close, and in doing so he reached the double-digit goal plateau for the first time in his career while spoiling Lackey’s clean sheet in the process. With the game in its final minutes and already out of reach for the Terriers, a wrist shot from junior Gabriel Chabot also snuck by Lackey.
Overall, though, Lackey was sturdy between the pipes on Monday night. The 24-save performance marks the 15th time in 22 starts this season that he has held the opponent to two scores or fewer. Lackey’s solid season (13-6-3, 2.17 GAA, .923 SV%) has been crucial to the Crimson’s surge back into the rankings and the NCAA Tournament conversation in 2019.
Harvard’s offensive point man, junior Adam Fox, achieved a significant milestone in the Beanpot consolation game, becoming the fourth defenseman in program history to reach the 100-point mark (20–80—100).
With the accomplishment, Fox joins the elite company of former Crimson standouts Mark Fusco ’83 (44–91—135), Mark Benning ’87 (9–102—111), and Randy Taylor ’87 (14–88—102). Fox, quite possibly the most talented offensive defenseman in college hockey, also becomes the first rearguard to reach the 100-point milestone in his junior season since 2011-2012, when now-Pittsburgh Penguins blue-liner Justin Schultz did so for Wisconsin.
“[Fox is] a tremendous player,” coach Donato said. “He makes others around him better. His poise with the puck, his patience, his playmaking ability — I can’t say enough. I’ve been very fortunate in my life to be around some great players…but I think what he’s accomplished so far in college is pretty special, and we’re happy that he’s on our team.”
Monday night’s Beanpot affair was a clash between two teams with very different motivations. For the Terriers, an inconsequential non-conference game against the Crimson failed to inspire the group, resulting in Harvard’s domination for the bulk of the first two periods. By the time BU honed its game to match the Crimson’s intensity, a comeback was improbable.
Coach Donato’s squad, on the other hand, rightfully approached Monday night as a chance to further its case for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Despite the early start time and eerie silence in the arena, Harvard took care of a formidable opponent — one whom it tied in early January.
With the loss, the Terriers suffer their first fourth-place finish in the Beanpot since 2014, when the Crimson likewise delivered a frustrating defeat in the consolation match.
“Harvard played a really good game,” said BU coach and former Harvard assistant Albie O’Connell. “I can’t say that about our club. We were more prepared in the practice yesterday…. You can’t play a Division-I hockey game and expect to win when you don’t show up.”

Once upon a time, college students relied on Yik Yak as the hub for anonymously posting their random musings and seeking validation from their peers. Though it was a fun platform for sharing inside jokes within universities, the location-based discussion platform shut down in 2017 due to increased complaints of discrimination and cyberbullying. However, it appears that its spirit has been reborn through Yard.chat, an anonymous message board whose creator has not yet been revealed. The platform serves as a helpful resource for sharing valuable tips, but it’s also a space for Harvard students to gratuitously talk about ~just Harvard~ things. Here are a few gems from the website:
Currently reigning as the most-upvoted post is unanimous praise for our dearly loved John from Annenberg. No matter what background we may come from, this is something we can all agree on.
What better way to use an anonymous discussion board than to shamelessly promote parties? The days of desperately asking “what’s the wave” and aimlessly walking around the Quad are over.
Some have used the platform to publicly vent their hot takes about HUDS menu options. Although passionate in intention, you’re probably better off just texting the HUDS number with your complaint. Keep fighting the good fight, though.
This is easily the best post on the platform. We don’t make the rules.
While similar to Yik Yak both in concept and in appearance, this platform differs in that it promises a better reboot with a more lighthearted culture. According to its FAQ, Yard.chat is “intended as a place to air opinions that normally are kept private and to share the personal stories which have no other outlet.” Note that the website establishes strict ground rules prohibiting bullying, direct references to people, and slurs.
Considering that this feature isn’t the first technological innovation to sprout from this year, we can probably anticipate seeing more crowded classrooms in Maxwell-Dworkin and a lot more laptops adorned with stickers from tech companies. The future is now, and it deserves an upvote.
