After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite months of contrary activism on campus, Yale has decided to retain the name of former U.S. Vice President and ardent defender of slavery John C. Calhoun for one of its residential colleges. We believe this is a mistake.
Even as a board that has historically been hesitant to support name changes, we see this situation differently. Calhoun was a politician known for little more than his strong defense of slavery’s existence and expansion through the constitutionally-questionable philosophy of nullification. When we opposed name changes in the past, we worried about the application of present-day morality to multifaceted figures from the past. But even by the standards of his own day, Calhoun is not a figure worth honoring.
We opposed the renaming of Harvard’s House masters because changing a title that the administration itself admitted had no direct relation to slavery makes little sense. We opposed the changing of the Law School’s seal, because of its similarly attenuated relationship to racial animus and the importance of reconciling the past with the present without erasing the troubling parts of our history.
In the case of Calhoun at Yale, however, we see an entirely different situation: Some figures from the past should remain there. Calhoun should certainly be remembered as a Yale alumnus and vice president of the United States who promoted deeply problematic ideas about slavery. But there is no positive part of his legacy we can point to in attempting to honor him.
At the same time this change was announced, Yale also made three other decisions about names on campus, naming two new residential colleges and replacing the title of “master” with “head of college.” The new colleges, named for Benjamin Franklin, a “personal role model” of the donor who provided the funds to construct the college, and Anna Pauline “Pauli” Murray, a civil rights activist and the first African American to receive a Doctor of Juridical Science degree from Yale Law School, will allow Yale to admit 200 more students each year.
The decision to retain Calhoun but change “master” is both confusing and inconsistent. It does not make sense to change a title with tenuous connection to slavery, but keep the name of a man who once argued on the floor of the Senate that slavery was “a positive good.”
Still, despite the unfortunate circumstances of these naming decisions, at least one deserves praise in its own right. Murray is more than deserving of the honor, and we commend Yale for celebrating her as a pioneer in racial and gender identity. While it’s important not to categorize people with labels they did not use, we are excited that Yale chose to honor someone who lived outside the norms of gender and sexual identity.
As we discuss these changes at Yale, it’s also important to remember that Harvard still plays a role in all of this: Murray was rejected from Harvard Law School simply due to her gender. This dubious connection underscores the undeniable value of elevating figures like Murray in our collective memories, and also the hard but necessary obligation to remember difficult periods of our history. With so many figures like Pauli Murray worth remembering, continuing to honor John C. Calhoun and pursuing contrived battles over titles like master will only set back real progress on inclusion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We spend almost nine months out of the year adhering to a strict, rigorous schedule mandated by the College. Early in the morning our alarms go off and off and off until we can no longer rationalize hitting the snooze button. Through the rain, fog, and unending mountains of snow, we slog to class every day and night in preparation for midterms, papers, and exams that we will forget in mere weeks.
And then, it all ends.
Structure goes from omnipresent to nonexistent quite literally overnight. After spending most of our lives in a schooling system that aggressively overschedules nearly ever hour of the day, we are suddenly given a week filled with more pressure than any other and little support to navigate it.
Walking into Lamont during reading week ranks one notch below cruel and unusual punishment. Each face carries the weight of an unknown trauma, imminent demise in the form of one too many blue books, and the silent but distant prayer that the sweet release of summer lies in waiting. As time goes on, the smell lingers and grows until it walks the halls like a demon guarding the unsuspecting souls it claimed. No happiness can enter that building and no victors ever leave.
But where can you go if not the library? How can you manage to work on papers, projects, presentations, and study for finals without falling down a rabbit hole of doom? Some try dining halls, a regular play for those seeking asylum from the madness of finals while still hoping to salvage their GPAs. Throughout most of the year, the dhall provides a home for all those looking to work in a non-soul-crushing environment, but even this oasis is compromised during these dark times.
A place that once housed joyous meals and heated debate now becomes the catacombs of our hopes and dreams. Empty chairs at empty tables fill the room with memories of what we have lost and nightmares of what we must face. The floor to ceiling windows that once showed immaculate displays of the river, the sun, and the stars give way to constant reminders of the overcast skies and rain we must endure until we have any chance at salvation.
Running out of options, we find the dorm room as the last beacon of hope for prevailing through it all. The room you dedicated an entire year to making your own, to making your home. The bed covered in sheets with your favorite sports team’s logo or childhood cartoon character. The workspace all your own, free from any of the distractions and mood altering stimuli of the outside world.
And even without the institutionally-imposed structure of the school year, you know now is the time to gird your loins and work. Today we begin anew and prepare for the wars to come as we hunker down into the workspace of our own making. Nothing can stop us from reaching our full potential.
Until you remember your friend’s Hulu password. One episode of "Empire" to free your mind will likely allow increased productivity. Honestly, if you don’t watch that one episode, you probably won’t be able to study at all. Watching a little "Empire" is basically in the syllabus for your gen ed. So you settle down with your computer, plug in your earbuds, and sit down for one—just one, you tell yourself—episode.
And then, you get a text from your friend back home: “LaMarcus Aldridge is pulling some vintage Duncan right now!!!1!” You know that if you tried to study now, you would spend the entire time thinking about the game. How can you be productive when all you can think about is LA pulling out the Duncan remix and draining a 15-footer turnaround in Serge Ibaka’s mouth? What if you miss Duncan giving the backboard one last sweet kiss as he banks in an 18-footer off glass right in the Slim Reaper’s mouth?! Studying will have to wait.
As the best game of the playoffs comes to a close, you look over to the clock only to realize it is one in the morning. The day has passed you by without any real work getting done. But if you stay up and try to work now, how will you get work done tomorrow? You will be tired all day and struggle to focus. In fact, the only smart play here would be getting a good night’s rest in preparation to take the next day by storm.
That makes sense, right? It doesn’t matter that this has happened yesterday too, right? Tomorrow will be a new day. The perpetual promise of tomorrow shall save us all from this lackluster, uninspired existence restoring our drive and capability. We shall rise and take on all that the world may offer with the unwavering determination we entered today with. Wait……… Good luck with the final in the morning!!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Basking in the praise of the national press for its efforts to make all-male final clubs go co-ed, Harvard has left out an important piece of the story: female final clubs. 
On top of the eight historically male clubs—each of which is over a century old—there are five female clubs, founded between 1991 and 2008. Harvard’s administration has engaged the male clubs’ leadership for over a year about the changing social landscape on campus, only bringing us, their female peers, into the conversation this past fall.
As graduate leaders of a women’s club, we support the idea of moving towards gender inclusivity. We are also committed to ensuring a safe and equitable social experience, not just for our members, but for women at Harvard.
But we are deeply worried about the way Harvard is going about this change.
In the past few months, the female clubs have tried to work with Harvard’s administration to ensure that both men’s and women’s clubs transition safely and that women do not become collateral damage in the transition. Harvard has given us no indication it understands these concerns.
If the male clubs unilaterally go co-ed—as the Spee and the Fox already have—new female members will be at a significant disadvantage vis-à-vis new male members. The leadership structures and alumni bases of these clubs are still all-male, and will remain predominantly so for the next few years, if not decades.
These new women members, selected by a pre-existing all-male membership, will lack the benefit of women in leadership positions, who could help develop a truly gender-inclusive culture. They will also lack a female alumnae base. We have concerns about whether such conditions will be safe and beneficial for women.
Additionally, because female clubs (unlike male clubs) lack what Harvard students have repeatedly expressed desire for—adequate social spaces—if all the clubs went co-ed, there is a distinct possibility female clubs will die out. The support systems, safe spaces, and alumnae networks the women’s clubs have been striving to build will disappear. That strikes us as a tremendous waste, and an ironic one, given Harvard’s stated goals.
Harvard has given little indication that it has considered whether the new reality it demands will in practice benefit women on campus. According to conversations we have had with members of the Spee and Fox, the administration has not even reached out to understand how each of these formerly male clubs has integrated, or how they plan to support their new female members.
Why has Harvard ignored these concerns? Because it is enacting this policy primarily as a form of damage control.
Harvard is facing a barrage of media attacks concerning its abysmal sexual assault statistics, as well as an ongoing federal investigation and at least one lawsuit alleging Title IX violations.
In all, circumstances are ripe for quick-fix solutions that could actually run counter to the substance of what Harvard seeks to accomplish: reducing sexual assault and creating true equity for women.
If Harvard wishes to support students of all genders, it must encourage all final clubs—both male and female—to arrive at a solution that safeguards female leadership and networks, and allow final clubs the time required to do so.
If the administration and the press continue only to push for hasty, symbolic victories, that’s all we’re likely to get.

Walter S. Isaacson ’74 has been President and CEO of the Aspen Institute since 2004. Isaacson, a native of New Orleans, graduated cum laude from Harvard College in 1974 and from Pembroke College, Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. Upon graduating from Oxford, Isaacson entered a career in journalism, becoming managing editor of TIME Magazine in 1996 and chairman and CEO of CNN in 2001. Isaacson has authored several best-selling books, including biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, and Steve Jobs. Isaacson has served on the Board of Overseers of Harvard since 2010.
Fifteen Minutes: As a result of the social media revolution, Americans now have the opportunity to see more dimensions of political candidates than ever before. Do you believe that these changes have improved or tarnished the overall democratic process?
Walter Isaacson: I think that a couple of decades ago, reporters were actually able to get a more intimate and closer look at candidates. They weren't shielded off by ropes and herded into pens. They were able to have long dinners and background conversations with the candidates. Now candidates are very guarded, and a smart person like Hillary Clinton seems always on guard about making what Michael Kinsley called the Washington definition of a gaffe, which is when you accidentally tell the truth about what you really think. So I think it's been a mixed blessing. What's been particularly good about social media is that it allows everybody to be both a reporter and a commentator rather than the old media way of a few gatekeepers controlling what got reported and said.
FM: Do you believe that the media is to blame for the political gridlock and polarization that has developed in the United States over the last decade?
WI: I think it's partly true. I think that both the technology and the approach of media tends to divide us as a nation into ideological camps more than it did in the past generation. It used to be that there'd be three nightly newscasts, three news magazines, and an anchor who would say "That's the way it is," and we would have a general sharing of information. There was a downside to that which is an elite media establishment got to decide what to tell people. But nowadays, you can get your political biases reinforced by going to some edge of the talk radio dial, some cable news show, or some corner of the blogosphere where you hear mainly people who have the same ideology as you do. So that's been one of a dozen factors that has caused a political polarization in this country and led to paralysis in government.
There are many other factors such as gerrymandering or the role of money in politics. But if you're trying to appeal to a broad center of the electorate, you realize that, as Benjamin Franklin said, "Compromisers may not make great heroes, but they do make great democracies." That compromise is a lubricant for getting things done. We have paralysis now because whether it's in the media or in the way our primary system chooses candidates, people get pilloried for being willing to compromise rather than praised.
FM: In recent years, there has been a lot of media attention surrounding hyper-political correctness and the need for “safe spaces” on college campuses. What are your thoughts on this trend?
WI: I don't think it's anything new. Whether it was the Puritan theologians at Harvard in the 17th century, or the period of the 1950s when there was McCarthyism, or when I went to college in the 1970s, there were a lot of battles over free speech. I think that President Faust along with President Summers have stood firmly and clearly in favor of the value of free speech.
The controversies now are real, but they seem more minor than the ones you had during the McCarthy era and the Civil Rights era and the Vietnam War era. That said, we have to make sure that a campus is a place where all viewpoints get heard, because one of the roles of a university is to expose people to a diversity of ideas, including ideas that may make them feel uncomfortable.
On the flip side, what some people decry as political correctness is partly just people being asked to be polite and not use language that may have been used in the locker rooms when I was a student and that people find demeaning. I think people who try to enforce political correctness and people who flap their arms too much about political correctness both need to be a little bit more sensitive to the rights and feelings of others.
I would think among the goals of a great university are to instill empathy, to teach the virtues of collaboration, and to prepare you for a world filled with diversity and the need to work well with others. The debates you see on campus now are actually healthy, because it shows people wrestling with these issues what they're going to face in the real world.
FM: On the topic of education, over the last decade, the arts and humanities have often taken a back seat to STEM fields at leading universities across country. At Harvard, you studied History and Literature. You’ve since become an important advocate for the humanities as well as a leader in the study of the technology and innovation. In your view, why should young people study the humanities in the 21st century?
WI: The greatest creativity has come from the people who are able to stand at the intersection of the humanities and the sciences, from Leonardo da Vinci to Steve Jobs. I'm looking across my room at a print of the Vitruvian Man, the famous Leonardo drawing of the man doing jumping jacks in the circle and square. That is an example and a symbol of art and science connecting. When you ask Steve Jobs what set him apart as the great genius of the personal computer age, he would say it was his ability to realize that beauty mattered, that design was key and that connecting a feel for the humanities with engineering set Apple apart from any other company.
In the past 50 years of the digital revolution, [innovation] has been largely driven by engineering breakthroughs. But now we're seeing a next phase in which innovation depends on human creativity, on having the imagination and the sense of humanities that can't be replicated merely in an algorithm or a machine. So that creativity, which will drive the next phase of the biotech and digital tech revolution, comes from having a feel for history, morality, art, and human sensibility. That comes from understanding the magic of the connection of the humanities to technology.
FM: Up until about a month ago, you were arguably the most famous member of the Harvard College class of 1974. Now America's eyes are on a different member, your friend and fellow D.C. resident, Judge Merrick B. Garland ’74. Tell me a little bit about your relationship with Judge Garland.
WI: First of all, I will not accept your premise that I was particularly famous… or as distinguished as Merrick. Merrick has always had a profound sense of moral purpose combined with open mindedness. He would be the perfect Supreme Court Justice. He is, I guess, the highest thing you can aspire to after a lot of learning: to process it into wisdom based on values. That's what Merrick has done in his life, unlike most of us, who have merely aspired to [that].
FM: Despite living in D.C., you've remained deeply involved with your hometown, New Orleans. Since Katrina, the city has faced myriad issues, and its recovery has been a slow process. What is your outlook for the future of the city?
WI: After Katrina, when we were trying to convince everybody to come back home and that we would be able to rebuild, Wynton Marsalis came down from New York on the bus of his band and gave a talk. He said there was nothing like a hurricane to remind you of the value of home, because what we call home forms the essence of who we are. The essence of New Orleans is a city that, for more than 300 years, has been a gumbo pot of diversity. French and Spanish and Americans and slaves and freed slaves and Creoles and Haitians and Vietnamese have come to a port city and mixed and mingled with all the friction that can cause.
But what New Orleans teaches us is that diversity promotes creativity. It leads to jazz. When the Spanish American War veterans honk their trumpets and bring their march tunes to a place where there are drummers in Congo Square and the French Opera House, and ragtime orchestras and slave spirituals and blues coming down from the plantations... That mix creates something new. It's true of the food; it's true of the mindset. If we are going to be successful in the 21st century, it is going to be those communities and countries that are comfortable with ethnic and racial and ideological diversity versus those that end up in sectarian civil wars. To that extent, New Orleans is not just home to me, but an example of what we're striving to create in order to be both a creative society and a civil society.
Six years ago, Harvard Business School embarked on one of the most ambitious case studies in its 108-year history. The case: gender inequality. The protagonist: itself.
Gender inequality in the business world has long been a topic of conversation and research among academics, but it was only a few short years ago that these issues came to a head at one of the world’s most influential business institutions.
A 2013 New York Times article revealed gender discrimination in the school’s classrooms, sexism female students faced at social gatherings, and, perhaps most glaring, numbers showing that female students were not performing as well as their male counterparts.
Biases were also apparent in the curriculum. In 2014, a mere nine to 10 percent of the case studies produced at the  Business School produced featured a female protagonist.
The imbalance has been longstanding among professors, too. Just six years earlier, in 2007, there was a “mass exodus” of female faculty—nine of 28 junior female faculty members left.
However, when Business School Dean Nitin Nohria took the helm in 2010, gender inequality was one problem he pledged to address. He, alongside University President Drew G. Faust, promised to rework gender relations at the school.
Since then, Nohria has committed to doubling the number of female protagonists in case studies by 2019. Just last year, the school launched the Gender Initiative, a research-based initiative that aims to promote the advancement of women in business.
The efforts seem to be bearing fruit. Both the achievement gap and satisfaction gap have been closed across male and female Business School students, according to Senior Associate Dean and chair of the MBA program Felix Oberholzer-Gee.
Faculty hiring, spearheaded by Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Planning and Recruiting Frances X. Frei, has seen improvements. But the school has a way to go before it sees gender equity in its highest level of professors.
CHANGES IN THE CLASSROOM
At the “50 Years of Women at Harvard Business School” gala event in 2014, hosted by the school’s Northern California association, Nohria announced a concrete goal in the mission for gender equality: double the number of female protagonists in the school’s case studies. Prior to this, only nine to 10 percent of the cases the Business School produced featured a woman protagonist, meaning that the case was written about a scenario in which the central decision-maker was a woman.
The discrepancy has been largely attributed to the fact that many of the cases deal with the highest levels of management, and thus draw from a field that is notoriously dominated by men.
Still, women made up 41 percent of the MBA class of 2015—a number far greater than the number of women protagonists about which they learned.
And it was not just the Business School’s student population that saw such discrepancies.
The Business School is the leader in case study production globally, producing more than 80 percent of the cases sold to business schools around the world. This global reach means the Business School’s influence extends far beyond its Allston campus.
Increasing female protagonists may seem like a small step in a large problem, but several people, both students and faculty, said it is “symbolic” for female students.
In terms of reaching the goal for female protagonists, Nohria said the Business School has “already made progress” and that “the slopes are all positive, and if you project the slopes out then I have great confidence that we will actually meet that goal.”
Other measures were taken in the classroom to foster an environment of gender equity, such as the installation of notetakers who track participation in each class to ensure participation is fairly graded, Frei said. The notetakers are in every course for first-year students and a number of second-year classes, per the professor’s request.  
Before, classes were conducted more informally—professors standing at the front of the class, students at their seats with name placards in front of them, and instructors ready to “cold call” on someone for an answer. Such teaching is the traditional method used in business schools.
However, professors typically would not consider what students said in class. Rather, after class, once they sat down to do the grading, professors would recall from memory how each of the students performed. Frei said often times, male students can be more assertive than female students, which in many cases, translates to a better participation grade when being scored by memory.
Additionally, Frei said the Business School added different class formats to the curriculum. Previously, she said the school used to only hold large discussions. Now, Frei says there are smaller, experimental discussions that “allows more people to do well.”
A GAP IN FACULTY
If the gaps between male and female students have begun to close, they remain wide in the Business School’s faculty.
Currently, there are only 21 full-time female professors, compared to the 81 male professors at the same level. Among associate and assistant professors, men still outnumber their female colleagues 45 to 32. Indeed, in the faculty as a whole, there are only 69 women to 209 men. 
Frei said she and her team, which normally hires 20 to 25 individuals each year, noticed that, unbeknownst to the school, the Business School had been hiring men at the assistant level at twice the rate of women.
“I don’t know what the right number is, if it should be 50-50 or what,” she said, “but this number certainly didn’t feel right.”
Frei began troubleshooting, and what she found was that men were accepting faculty positions at a significantly higher rate than women. In the past three years, however, Frei said her team has hired just as many women as men for the first time in the school’s history.
“Bringing over tenured women is extremely difficult. We have had much better success bringing over tenured men than tenured women, and I think we’ve been applying the same techniques,” Frei said. “Now, we’re looking at [hiring numbers] by the data and seeing that the same techniques applied to everyone is yielding a gap in our success rate. So we’re wondering ‘why?’ We’re in the early stages of that.”
Typically aimed at new assistant professors, these hiring techniques include broad advertising to a variety of institutions, an annual conference in which 15 to 20 prospective faculty are invited for an interview, and an in-depth campus visit for five to eight of the remaining interviewees.
While the Business School is making a concerted effort to attract more equal numbers of male and female faculty to the school, discrepancies in faculty experience remain.
“We have even bigger satisfaction gaps [among faculty], and we don’t know about the achievement,” Frei said. “We conspicuously don’t know about the achievement. It feels like no one has done the analysis.”
While achievement gaps among students are easier to observe through comparing GPAs of male and female students, Frei said achievement gaps are less clear among faculty.
Frei pointed to a 2012 University-wide faculty climate survey in which junior male faculty at the Business School reported being happier than their female counterparts.
For professor of manufacturing Janice H. Hammond—one of the 21 senior female faculty members—the fact that there are more than 20 women at the professor level is a victory. At the time she joined the Business School’s faculty in 1984, women comprised only seven percent of faculty.
“I’m thrilled every time another woman crosses that bar,” Hammond wrote in an email. “The growth has not been as rapid as I would have liked, and we have lost some outstanding women over the years, but the number in the pipeline has increased steadily.”
CROSS CAMPUS
In the year since its creation a project called the Gender Initiative has helped raise awareness of gender imbalance at the Business School through the program’s research that aims to promote the advancement of women in business.
The initiative, spearheaded by Senior Associate Dean for Culture and Community Robin J. Ely, gathers data that dispels common misconceptions about women in business and the workplace and provides this data to external companies and the school itself.
“So much of what people are saying about women and gender in the business world is simply not supported by the data,” Ely said. “We really want to help people understand the circumstances in which gender-based differences in performances occur.”
Angela C. Winkle, former co-president of the Business School’s Women’s Student Association, which works closely with Ely to disseminate Gender Initiative information, said she has seen an increased level of awareness surrounding gender issues at the school.
“I think you’ll see some professors who are very explicit and market the course saying it’s 50-50 male and female cases,” she said.
The WSA, which hosts events and speaker series throughout the year, does even more work behind the scenes.
According to newly elected WSA co-president Hillary B. Maxwell, the WSA’s academics committee seeks to bring female students together to foster discussion with like-minded students who “have a lot of prowess in specific topics like finance or investing.”
This committee, Maxwell said, organizes female-led activities such as review sessions before finals.
Recently, the Student Association, the Business School’s student governing body, elected for the first time in the school’s history two female co-presidents—Libby Z. Leffler and LaToya Marc.
Leffler and Marc have not yet mapped out their complete platform of initiatives, but they emphasized that an inclusive school environment is high on their list of priorities.
The gender initiative and Nohria's case study goals have made a notable impact on campus, some students and faculty said. Hammond has observed cultural shifts in the school since the 1980s and wrote she “often found it challenging” to be at HBS during that time, but that “she wanted to make it work.” Now, she said, the school is much more supportive of a diverse faculty and student body, there is consistent collaboration between men and women in research, and there are more women in leadership roles.
“The policies are important, but without the ongoing changes to the culture, I don’t think as many women could thrive here as they can today,” Hammond wrote. “It’s still not perfect, but we continue to make substantial progress.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reflecting on their first semester as leaders of the Undergraduate Council, UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 and UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 highlighted several new initiatives that they hope to institutionalize in the fall.
Rather and Banks, who ran for Council leadership last fall on a platform to “Open Harvard,” won the November presidential election with about 46 percent of first-choice votes. 
That platform became the basis for the UC’s “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” a $30,000 fund piloted this semester for new student initiatives that address “compelling interests” voted upon annually by the Council. This year’s compelling interests are mental health, race relations, sexual assault and harassment, and social spaces.
In an interview, Rather said much of the fund's success came from student leaders on campus finding creative ways of addressing the compelling interests. The UC allocated the entire fund this semester.
“Student leaders on this campus have stepped up, and they have raised the bar,” Rather said.
Earlier this semester, some leaders of student theater organizations took issue with a policy that included a provision that provided more funding to theater productions that addressed compelling interests. In response to concerns over the policy overall, UC leaders promised to improve communication about Council policies.
Recently, the Council allocated $3,000 from the fund to pre-Yardfest neighborhood block parties, which Banks praised as a valuable step towards providing open social spaces on campus.
“If that was our legacy alone, that would be something that I would be happy about,” Banks said. “That is something that has come out of the innovation of the student body.”
Rather said she hopes to work with the Office of Student Life to make the event a “permanent part of Yardfest.”
This semester, UC representatives approved every grant allocation under the fund recommended by Rather, Banks, Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, and Treasurer Samarth Gupta '18. But some raised concerns about the procedural aspects of the grant, noting that, unlike other pieces of legislation that the Council passes, the grant’s allocations do not go through one of the UC’s committees before being brought to the entire Council.
Rather said she and Banks will consider how to reform the grant’s legislative procedures, and suggested they may consider either the creation of a committee to evaluate grant requests or the appointment of a chair for the grant.
Rather and Banks said they plan to work with administrators to determine the future size of the fund, and hope it will be at least as large, if not larger, next year. This year, College administration funded half of the grant, while the other half came from the UC’s budget.
They also pointed out that, once the fall semester begins, they have limited time to put forward additional policy.
“We have around two months when we get back and then elections start,” Rather said. “That’s not a lot of time.”
Rather and Banks said they hope to use their remaining time to put forward new pilot programs, in addition to turn some of the existing initiatives from this semester—including the “Grant for an Open Harvard College” and the pre-Yardfest block parties—into “institutional frameworks.”
Banks also pointed to the recent Club 1636 event as an example of another social initiative that he would like to see continue.
“Shaiba and I have been working on this since we were co-chairs of the [Student Initiatives Committee], and now it’s really empowering to see something like this happen,” Banks said.
Rather and Banks also said they hoped students would continue to work to achieve their administration’s goals, even after new UC leaders are chosen.
“‘Open Harvard’ can’t end two months into next semester. If we’re successful, it’ll be something that people will be envisioning and redefining and restructuring,” Banks said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the beginning of the semester, the Office of International Education has used a new coffee chat program to reach out to students in Harvard’s 12 undergraduate Houses in the hopes of attracting more students to study abroad programs.
Nicole M. Garcia, assistant director at OIE, said the coffee chat program is geared toward both students who have returned from term-time study abroad and students who are interested in studying abroad.
Students who wish to participate in the program can reach out to student advisers at OIE and set up meetings in coffee shops in Harvard Square.
“For the return students, the idea is they come back and have to adjust to the pace of Harvard,” Garcia said. “So it’s an opportunity to recognize that they’ve had this wonderful opportunity and they’re coming back to enrich our communities.”
For students who are planning to study abroad, coffee chats can present an opportunity to spend one-on-one time with a student adviser, allowing them to ask personalized questions.
“I thought they were really helpful in understanding what each individual’s need is,” Kia C. Turner '16, a student adviser for OIE in Leverett, said. “Choosing an abroad experience should be really personalized based on what your academic interests are [and] why you want to go abroad.”
OIE has focused on reaching out to students in the Houses for the program. Each House has at least one student adviser who helps program outreach events and can serve as a resource for the students.
Brianna J. Suslovic '16, an OIE student adviser in Winthrop, said many students have approached her with questions about study abroad.
“Being visible in Winthrop House as someone students can go to with questions about study abroad is really fulfilling,” she said. “The way we are doing all of this outreach now makes a big difference.”
Turner said she has been able to direct outreach efforts in Leverett House through panel discussions, drop-in hours, and study breaks.
“The advisers do all kinds of programming in the Houses,” Garcia said. “There’s a timeline they follow from semester to semester in terms of what happens inside their House.”
Aside from the scheduled activities, she also noted that the advisers can come up with new ideas every year.
Kathryn R. Klingle ’17, a student adviser in Eliot, was able to host a “study abroad Stein Club” last fall funded by Eliot’s House Committee. Klingle also said she has been invited by Eliot’s advising team and tutors to table at career fairs.
For Turner, the most meaningful part about being a student adviser for OIE is helping students see the vast benefits of studying abroad.
“I think there is a feeling on campus that people don’t go abroad, they can’t go abroad, they shouldn’t because there’s amazing professors and people here,” she said. “But I found that I ended up loving this place even more than I did before I went.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences discussed what ideal General Education courses should look like in the new program at their final full meeting of the semester on Tuesday.
The chair of the Gen Ed standing committee Edward J. Hall, also chair of the Philosophy Department, presented a vision for courses and discussed opportunities and challenges for faculty teaching new Gen Ed courses.
“The key will be to work together—patiently and above all collaboratively—on building a slate of courses that target the broad aim of the program,” he said.
Hall outlined several characteristics he hopes to see in new Gen Ed courses. First, he said, such courses should be relevant to undergraduates by focusing on issues that impact their individual identities and conceptions of citizenship. He added that such “practical applicability” should be “understood in a non-utilitarian manner.”
Hall also said the Gen Ed course instructor’s academic focus should not define the central problem a class addresses and that ideal Gen Ed courses should “teach through” a discipline rather than “teach about” a discipline. In addition, he recognized that student and faculty interests do not necessarily always align and, therefore, professors teaching in Gen Ed should explicitly explain the choices made in the design of the course.
“The point is not to pander but rather to articulate, to explain, and thereby to engage,” Hall said.
Under the new program, which the Faculty approved in March, students will take four courses in new Gen Ed categories and fulfill three distribution requirements across FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. They also will complete a course that emphasizes quantitative skills. College administrators hope to launch the new program in the fall of 2018.
Government professor Danielle S. Allen, who is also director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, said she hopes professors will work with the center to develop courses in the new Gen Ed’s “Ethics and Civics” category.
“There’s a lot of curricular and pedagogic reform across the University having to do with ethics,” Allen said. “We’re just looking for six or so good souls looking to experiment with us.”
Also at Tuesday’s meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris gave an update on the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, convened in the 2012-2013 academic year to oversee smaller subcommittees tasked to review a variety of issues in undergraduate education.
Harris said some committee members are reevaluating the place of academic writing and public speaking at the College. Specifically, researchers within FAS and a group of outside experts under the direction of Les Perelman, a retired administrator and writing professor at MIT, are looking into the Expository Writing program. Perelman is known for working on the College Board’s 2014 decision to make the SAT writing section optional.
“We are looking at various ways in which we can heighten the focus on student writing,” Harris said. “There certainly always remains room for improvement.”
Harris also said the committee, working with faculty members and departments’ directors of undergraduate study, will consider discussing public speaking, advanced standing requirements, study abroad opportunities, and joint concentrations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 4 2016, at 1:29 p.m.
College administrators have made an ongoing effort to provide more support to help students studying abroad know what to expect regarding cultural norms and gender identity in the countries they are visiting.
Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, a student adviser for the Office of International Education in Winthrop, helped organize two panel events this semester focusing on identity-related issues abroad. The first was titled “Gender Abroad” and featured panelists who shared their experiences as women traveling in foreign countries.
About a dozen students and administrators gathered in the Fong Auditorium for a second event titled “Out Abroad” on April 12. The event, a collaborative effort among Global Support Services, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Office of International Education, featured six BGLTQ undergraduate panelists who had studied or worked abroad. The six panelists shared their experiences of being BGLTQ as they spent spring and summer semesters in foreign countries, sharing personal stories about relationships to cultural norms.
Suslovic spent her junior spring studying abroad in Madrid, Spain. She said she found that although most of her expectations about Spain were met regarding food, entertainment, and safety, she was surprised by a few experiences where her identity came to the forefront.
“It turns out some of the bigger things around gender and sexuality and race, I had a lot of assumptions going in that were incorrect,” Suslovic said. With regards to BGLTQ issues, she noted that Spain was generally progressive. However, she was also surprised to find that race would prove to be a more contentious issue.
“I think there were a couple incidents where my host mom would make really generalizing comments about all Asians, or all Africans,” Suslovic, who identifies as a biracial, said. “The idea of political correctness doesn’t really exist. And so because of that, occasionally my host mom would be watching the news and… would make very disparaging comments.”
When she was preparing for studying abroad in Spain, Suslovic said that she did not think about her identity as a potential point of concern.
“I think that in retrospect, it would be useful to have someone point me in the right direction,” she said.
For the past several years, administrators have made an ongoing effort to provide more resources for students going abroad.
Elizabeth E. Walsh, the program manager for strategic initiatives at Harvard Global Support Services, said she frequently meets with departments that plan to send Harvard personnel or students abroad to provide guidance and educational materials. She emphasized that she can be a resource for those who are unsure how to fit in safely within a culture vastly different from one’s own.
In speaking about her experiences working at GSS, Walsh mentioned that she recently received an email from a female student at Harvard Business School who was planning on traveling to Morocco in January. The female traveler expressed that at an informational meeting, she was advised to dress “conservatively” but did not know exactly what that meant.
Walsh, who came to Harvard in August after spending most of her career working in the United States Foreign Service, said she could easily relate.
“My very first trip to support a secretary overseas was [former Secretary of State Colin L.] Powell in Islamabad,” she said. “I was on that jump team and I was told the exact same thing… [but] that means something very different to someone who grew up in the U.S. than to someone in Pakistan so I obviously was not dressed appropriately.”
To answer the student’s question, Walsh said she put together a guide for dress in Morocco, which included pictures of appropriate outfits.
“I really wish someone had been specifically like ‘wear X, Y, Z,’” Walsh said, recalling her own experience traveling abroad. She said that her guide to dress, along with her other services to support students going abroad, emphasizes educating individuals about the cultural and legal implications of identifying as certain groups in other cultures.
“There is a wide spectrum of things and it really comes down to knowing your country, understanding its culture, and identifying spaces that are safe and how to move within those spaces,” Walsh said.

In June 1997, Allston residents were shocked by more than the overbearing summer heat. Facing Allstonians at a community meeting, Harvard was accused of “deception” as it took steps to become the neighborhood’s “landlord,” fielding concerns over the University’s six-year clandestine purchase of 52.6 acres of Allston neighborhood land.
Allston, which has housed Harvard Stadium since 1903 and Harvard Business School since 1927, took the stage as the next frontier for Harvard development. With the University’s new push from Cambridge to Boston, which has also housed Harvard Medical School since 1906 in Longwood, a new era of interaction between Harvard, the city, and its residents was born.
The Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city’s urban planning agency, was founded in 1957 to oversee the evolution of a changing city, its purview including eminent domain, and encouraging residential and commercial development. Today, the BRA classifies among its exhaustive list of responsibilities planning the future of Boston neighborhoods, expanding the tax base, encouraging sustainability, responding to population changes, and maintaining Boston’s unique character.
Harvard has sought BRA approval for each of its latest Allston projects, including a $1 billion new facility for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Continuum mixed residential and retail property, and the Life Lab, in a process that included neighborhood meetings for each new proposal.
In recent years, Harvard and the BRA have worked closely in the planning and execution stages of the University’s resolute march into Allston, often despite the protests of cramped residents. In 2007, The Crimson referred to the BRA as “the only entity with the ability to curtail Harvard’s activity.”
Backed by Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, the BRA is seeking a facelift after reforming its management structure, neighborhood planning, and community outreach.
Community members and city administrators are uncertain of how these changes will translate to a shift in BRA operation, its community relations, or the future of Harvard development.
Old Wounds
Almost two decades have passed since Harvard’s clandestine Allston land purchases were revealed, and though the BRA, Harvard, and Allston residents have collaborated on several development projects since, the old wounds have yet to fully heal.
“People recognize that the BRA is its own entity and plays a role in the development across the board,” said Jim Montgomery, an Allstonian and member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory board the BRA manages and composed primarily of Allston residents. “But I’m sure that some of the hard feelings and some of the bad feelings historically do go back to some of the early days of [the Allston] development.”
In 1997, Harvard officials were optimistic that once Allstonians felt the benefits of Harvard’s presence in their neighborhood, residents would warm to the University’s expansion across the river. After halting progress on Allston expansion through the 2000s—brought to a complete halt in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis—Harvard gained BRA approval for its Institutional Master Plan, a blueprint for Allston development, in 2013. The IMP includes a $43 million Allston community benefits package.
According to Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, each new Allston development has been planned with proportionate community benefits in mind.
Included in the package is a $5.35 million flexible fund for unspecified public improvements in Allston. Projects such as the Harvard Life Lab and Innovation Lab have been planned with community benefits in mind, the specifics of which have sometimes provided a point of conflict between Task Force members and University officials. At a rodent control meeting in early 2016, Allstonians lauded Harvard’s community gift of hundreds of rat-proof trash cans to combat the rodent problem.
Despite the benefits package, BRA review process, and series of community meetings, some Allstonians said they felt as if they were left to chase the bulldozers as Harvard and the BRA negotiated the terms of new Harvard development.
John A. Bruno, the interim chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said community concerns range from the logistical, criticizing long wait times for BRA projects, applications, and zoning appeals, and the cultural.
“I think there’s always been a question of transparency, meaning that, on occasion, there are local groups or associations that might approve of a project,” Bruno said, “And then ultimately the BRA makes the decision.”
Montgomery agreed that Allstonians have been concerned over what they conisder a lack of BRA transparency, with some calling BRA public processes a mere “rubber stamp” on deals negotiated primarily behind closed doors.
“I think that there are times where the community process seems to not prevail when maybe it should and then there’s no kind of real explanation other than the BRA has a different view,” Bruno said.
A New Coat of Paint 
When Walsh took office in January 2014, he was “not shy” about requiring the BRA to take a “very self-critical look at itself,” according to Nick Martin, the authority’’s director of communications. Walsh hoped to revise the BRA’s policies, procedures, and personnel, in addition to the way the body engaged with neighborhood residents, Martin said.
Over the course of 2014 and 2015, Walsh initiated two separate outside reviews of the BRA—the first a pro bono study performed by KPMG, a professional auditory company, the second a $420,000 operational review conducted by global consulting firm McKinsey & Company. According to Martin, McKinsey identified three main issues: the BRA did not do enough neighborhood planning, did not manage its real estate assets well, and had a poor agency management structure.
Based off of McKinsey’s recommendations, upper-level BRA employees constructed a more than 40 point action plan, Martin said, which the agency has begun to implement. In one recent reform, the BRA’s financial department switched from paper to digital records, enabling the agency to better collect revenue.
“[This is] really, in our minds, a cultural shift,” Martin said. “The agency operated one way for a very long time and we’re trying to basically open it up and be more clear and transparent and up-front and open about the decisions that we’re making.”
Now, the BRA hopes to “leverage these reforms” to improve its public image, Martin added. In March, the agency issued a formal request for an advising firm to help with its rebranding efforts. Martin characterized the upcoming reforms as an “external makeover,” noting that even the BRA’s name may change.
Some area residents said they were pleased with the BRA’s attempts at self-improvement. Montgomery said he felt the BRA “is certainly getting better” and that the agency is now “more open to suggestions.”
Bruno, the interim chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, agreed.
“This is a giant step in the right direction,” he said. “Somehow maybe the voices of skepticism throughout the community [are] now resonating within the city and [the city is] saying, ‘Okay, Okay, we hear you, we’re going to do something about it.’”
Others, however, said they remain skeptical. According to Greg Galer, the executive director of the Boston Preservation Alliance, many in the Boston area are unconvinced that “this is a new BRA,” though the agency has managed to partially increase its transparency.
Galer added that he does not believe the BRA has “gone far enough” or “demonstrated enough change” to warrant its current focus on re-branding.
“It’s almost like... putting a coat of paint over a building when you haven’t quite finished fixing all the wood yet,” Galer said. “You’re still anxious to show that the house is new and sell it, but you really haven’t done all the repairs and that coat of paint may not stick.”
The Million-Dollar Question
An improvement in the BRA’s public image may help to boost Harvard’s profile in the Allston area, some local residents said.
“In this neighborhood, certainly [Harvard and the BRA] are seen in the same lens, because it’s the same project,” Montgomery said. “The BRA is reviewing the same projects which are being sponsored by Harvard, for the most part.”
Bruno, however, firmly denied that the BRA’s image is tied to that of Harvard in Allston. The sole connection between the two as perceived by Allston residents, he said, is that some believe Harvard and the BRA continue to make deals behind closed doors, excluding the public.
“One could easily interpret that there’s private dialogue between the BRA and Harvard University,” he said. “What I’m always optimistic about is that we have a task force in place and we have community input... I think it’s important that we continue that kind of dialogue and that the BRA, in its effort to reform, gives us more of an active role in terms of what the community should look like and the reverse of that, that the BRA should let us know what they think the community should look like.”
Martin, the BRA representative, said the body’s priority, going forward, will be the communities it works with across the city and not institutions like Harvard. 
“I wouldn’t focus so narrowly on Harvard,” he said. “I think that the reforms that we’re doing are meant to engender a greater degree of trust and confidence... with anybody that we work with and all communities that we’re in, and we hope that the reforms that have been put in place and the ones that are yet to come really just improve the working relationship that we have with community members.”
Harvard Spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the “University takes seriously the regulatory and community process associated with receiving project approvals in the City of Boston” but declined to comment on the BRA’s ongoing reforms.
Putting aside concerns over public appearance, the issue remains: have the BRA’s recent reforms engendered actual change in the way the body will deal with developers like Harvard going forward?
“That,” as Galer said, “is the million-dollar question.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If one were to be asked what Harvard's College Dean, the interim Dean of Student Life, and the Director of University Health Services had in common, few would answer that all of them were rejects.
But that is exactly what each one of them said in videos and written statements posted online for the Bureau of Study Counsel’s “Reflections on Rejections” initiative. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s submission to a journal was denied, interim Dean of Student Life Thomas A. Dingman ’67 failed to write a History thesis, and University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira was rejected from several medical schools. 
The effort, a part of the the BSC’s ongoing Success-Failure Project, features a slate of professors, deans, staff members, and alumni.The idea for the project came out of a desire for students, faculty members, and administrators to think deeply about their definitions of success and failure, Ariel Phillips, an academic counselor at the BSC and co-coordinator of the project, said.
“Students were thinking about a path to success as very smooth, and defining success in narrow ways,” Phillips said. “Nobody was really asking, at least not when we were listening... how can I have a life that feels meaningful, as opposed to a life that’s sort of conventionally sanctioned as successful?”
Such an attitude toward success and failure, Phillips said, is not conducive to a life of risk-taking and exploration.
“When you’re trying to lead a life that’s smooth and not make any errors, you just try not to make many mistakes,” Phillips said. “You try to get the highest possible GPA you can, which I can appreciate, but in the the process we were feeling that there’s stuff that’s lost.”
In an effort to conduce discussion on the topic, the BSC collected accounts of rejection into a booklet published in 2013. Since then, the accounts of rejection have also taken the form of videos, some of them posted online as recently as fall of 2015.
“How we respond to a failure or rejection emerges in these pages as one of the most important skills we learn in our lives,” BSC Director Abigail Lipson wrote in her introduction to the 2013 booklet. “We learn to actively seek out the invaluable information and lessons to be gleaned from even a truly awful experience—rather than getting defensive or dejected or derailed.”
The accounts in the collection range from the academic to the professional to the personal. Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton, who is also a professor at the Divinity School, spoke on camera about what his rejections from graduate schools and from job opportunities taught him.
“Rejection is just part of the game of life,” Walton said in the video. “To win is, I would say, is to know how to suffer defeat. To know how to understand that you aren’t going to hit the mark, that you’re going to fall short. That is what gives us the emotional intelligence and the work ethic to get back up and try to do better.”

The number of students taking leaves of absence increased since 2010, from a low of 203 to a high of 242 last academic year, according to data provided by the College's Administrative Board.
The statistics reflect the number of students who successfully petitioned the Ad Board, the College's judicial body, for a leave of absence, and do not include students studying abroad or on leaves of absence mandated by administrators. 
According to Brett Flehinger, Associate Dean for Academic Integrity and Student Conduct, the College encourages students to consider the option of taking time off.
“We have a very wide-open leave policy with the goal that students will be able to come and go as they need to,” Flehinger said. “We want students to take leaves and we want them to use their eight semesters most effectively.”
Some students, like William F. Morris ’17-’18, said they were grateful they had made the decision to take time away from Harvard. Morris is currently taking the semester off and volunteering at a public defender’s office. He will intern at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Ga., this summer, advocating for mental health awareness.
“Taking time off has really given me a much better perspective on what I want to do at Harvard, what my goals are,” Morris said.
Most leaves are voluntary, with only rare cases of students being placed on leave by administrators. From the 2010-2011 academic year to 2014-2015, there were five students placed on leave, according to statistics from the Ad Board. Approximately 130 students have studied abroad each year since 2010-2011, although the number of students studying abroad spiked to 151 last year.
 “Virtually all the leaves are voluntary, sometimes they don’t feel as chosen by a student,” Flehinger said. “If I’m really happy to be here and I get a horrible case of mono and I simply can’t get out of bed for three weeks and now I’m so far behind, did I want to go on leave? No, but the College isn’t forcing me on leave, circumstance is.”
Luke R. Heine ’17, took time off during the fall and returned for spring semester, after realizing that he wanted to slow down, reflect on his college experience, and spend more time with his family.
“It’s phenomenal. I think in a lot of ways, it’s as if you leave a party, you open the door, you get some cool night air, and then you step back in.” Heine said. “When I’m 80, hopefully I get that old, and when I look back upon my life, those six months that I had with my family when we’re all in good health and I’m in my youth, I don’t think I’ll ever regret that.”
While some students who had taken leaves said they did not regret their decision, they acknowledged a stigma surrounding taking time off.
Morris said that stigma could stem from students' fears of looking weak or appearing unable to handle the pressure of Harvard, or from students not wanting to slow down their life plans.
“I think a lot of times people see Harvard as a stepping stone and it’s four years that they will use to get to the next step,” Morris said. “They might see taking time off as hindering them from getting to that step as quickly as possible.”
Flehinger said the College encourages students to take time off as a way of caring for themselves.
“Rather than struggle through a term, why not go somewhere where you can get healthier, and then come back and really learn and enjoy your time here?” Flehinger said.
Morris expressed interest in seeing the College help students who want to take time off and need funding. There is no financial aid for students taking time off, as financial aid applies only to current students.
“I would love to see the College... or a donor donate money to create a fund for people to take time off to work in the public sector or to work in academics,” Morris said. “I think the ideal situation would be to have people see Harvard as a five-year experience, four years in school, and one year to take time off, because I really do think it’s that valuable.”

Balloons and roughly 100 people filled the student lounge at Harvard Law School to commemorate graduating student activists and a year of continued race-related activism at the school in an informal commencement ceremony Tuesday evening.
The ceremony was held in the Caspersen Student Center lounge that activists have occupied since February and refer to as “Belinda Hall,” named after the slave of Isaac Royall Jr., whose 18th century donation helped establish the first law professorship at Harvard. The event featured spoken word and singing performances, a teaching presentation on structural racism, a slideshow, and speeches from students, clinical instructors, and staff members thanking activists for their work.
Race-related activism took off at the Law School in October, when students began calling on the school to change its controversial seal, which featured Royall’s family crest. The Reclaim Harvard Law movement emerged in the wake of a racially-charged incident of vandalism in November, and activists presented Law School Dean Martha L. Minow with a series of demands in December for better treatment of minorities at the school. They began occupying the student lounge in protest in February, sleeping overnight in shifts. In March, activists achieved a decisive victory when the Harvard Corporation approved a Law School committee’s recommendation to remove the seal, which has quickly disappeared from the school’s campus.
Activists continued to press for their remaining demands, however, and tensions escalated in the ensuing months as the lounge became the physical center of a debate over free speech at the Law School. That debate was complicated in April when activists discovered recording devices that had been illegally surveilling their conversations in the room. An investigation into the recorder is ongoing.
Second-year Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law member Aparna Gokhale said group members came up with the idea for a commencement ceremony several weeks ago during what they called a low point in their activism efforts.
“People were feeling pretty exhausted and burnt out from having done a lot of work over the semester and then facing a lot of opposition to what we’ve been working towards,” Gokhale said. “Commencement was a way to honor all the work they put in this year and over the last two years, and also a way for us to get positive energy into the space again, to remember why we started Belinda and what the ethos behind Belinda was.”
Third-year Law student and Reclaim Harvard Law member Rena T. Karefa-Johnson spoke about the support system she found among activists and the lessons in “radical love and resistance” she learned from the movement. Johnson recalled that during her first year at the Law School, she found that people were hesitant to speak publicly about race.
“To see what this room looks like right now is so crazy to me,” she said, looking around the crowded lounge.
To conclude the ceremony, first- and second-year Law students presented around 30 graduating third-years and Law School masters students with certificates and personal tributes. In an interview, Karefa-Johnson described the event as more meaningful for her than the Law School’s official commencement ceremony, which will take place on May 26.
“I think a lot of us have put more work into this work than into our school work, and in a lot of ways, it is more fulfilling for some of us who have really focused on [activism] throughout our time here to commence through this space,” Karefa-Johnson said.
Gokhale said the departure of the group’s senior members does not mark an end to Reclaim Harvard Law. The group will resume activism efforts in the fall, she said.

A player of any age can have the potential to lead a team.
At the recent CWPA Championships held at Blodgett Pool, both a rookie and an outgoing senior led the Harvard women’s water polo team to a sixth-place finish, stepping up for the team in the wake of a rash of injuries that left several other key players out of the pool.
The weekend tournament concluded a record-breaking season in which the No. 18 Crimson (24-10) won the most games in a season in its program history despite a season of trials and injuries.
Freshman attacker Kristen Hong recorded 12 goals, six assists, and four steals, while senior attacker Charlotte Hendrix recorded 10 goals, seven assists, and two steals over the weekend’s four games to pace the Harvard effort on the weekend. For their performances, the two were named The Crimson’s Co-Athletes of the Week.
“I really enjoyed playing on this team,” Hong said. “I love playing with the girls, and they’re such great teammates in and outside of the water.”
The team bond, not to mention the players’ physical endurance, was put to the test when core members were left unable to play for some cruical moments in the season. Junior 2-meter Melissa Balding, junior attacker Michelle Martinelli, junior attacker Zoe Osborne, and freshman utility Colby Stapleton did not play during the tournament.
“We lost a bunch of people to injuries right before the big tournament,” Hong said. “It was definitely a lot harder on all of us because we didn’t have any subs. I don’t think we did as well as we probably would have with a full squad. But considering the circumstances, we did very well.”
Even facing the tiring prospect of playing without multiple substitution field players, Hong and Hendrix managed to produce for Harvard under pressure.
Hendrix and Hong duplicated each other’s performance—twice—when they each scored four times in wins over George Washington (8-19) and Div III champion Connecticut College (15-9).
Hong’s 12 weekend tallies upped her team-leading season total to 80, setting a program record for goals in a season, breaking Hendrix’s total of 71 set in 2013. Hong also recorded season totals of 35 assists and a team-leading 45 steals to contribute on both ends of the pool.
The Orinda, Calif., native garnered five CWPA Div I/II Rookie of the Week honors and was named the team’s Rookie of the Year at the team’s recent awards banquet.
While Hong enjoyed a stellar freshman campaign, she attributed some of her success to Hendrix, who led the team in assists with 56, in addition to tallying 52 goals and 30 steals on the season.
“[Hendrix] has such great awareness in the pool,” Hong said. “I learned so much from her.”
Hendrix has enjoyed an illustrious career with the Crimson, finishing with more than 100 combined goals and assists in her each of her freshman, junior, and senior years to pace the team. Hendrix has also led the team in assists for the past two seasons and was an CWPA All-Division I/II Second Team member in 2015.
The strength of the duo’s performances is a testament to the strength of the team, even when depleted late in the year.
“This team, they came in from day one in September and started working,” said sixth-year head coach Ted Minnis. “They made it through all the ups and downs with the injuries and everything. We had seven girls there at the end [of the tournament], and they battled for the whole time. They had no quit in them.”
Sophomore goalie and team MVP Cleo Harrington provided the defense with brilliant performances all season long, and for her efforts, was named to both the 2016 CWPA Div I/II Championship All-Tournament First Team and All-Conference First Team.
In addition to the accolades bestowed on her younger teammates, senior captain Yoshi Andersen was named to the All-Tournament second team—a year removed from being named to both the tournament and conference first teams as a junior standout.
“I’m just really proud of them and I’m proud of the season,” Minnis said. “It was a fun year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down to the final inning of the 2016 regular season, Harvard softball faced elimination from playoff contention on Tuesday. If Dartmouth clung to its one-run lead, the Crimson would be heading home and the Big Green would move on to face South Division champion Princeton in the Championship Series.
However, Harvard (28-15, 16-4 Ivy) rallied for four runs in the top of the seventh and took the final game of the series from Dartmouth (27-15, 15-5) to win the Ivy League North Division by one game.
“I think it’s especially great for us to beat Dartmouth,” co-captain Morgan Groom said. “They’re our biggest rivals in the Ivy League for sure.”
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 5
Game two on Tuesday was the deciding factor for the North Division crown.
“There are so many things that can be on your mind in that situation, especially for us seniors trying with all of our might to extend our season to one more set of games,” co-captain Zoe Galindo said.
The Crimson faced a 5-4 deficit in the top of the seventh, but six hits later, Harvard found itself ahead, 8-5.
Sophomore Maddy Kaplan doubled to left and drove in Galindo and freshman Meagan Lantz to retake the lead.
The Big Green, down to its final out and trailing three runs, sent junior outfielder Lourlin Lara to the plate to try to spark a rally.
Lara sent a bounding ball to freshman shortstop Rhianna Rich, and Rich scooped it up, quickly transferred, and threw to junior first baseman Savannah Bradley on the run. Bradley stretched and held on to Rich’s throw, and the Crimson rushed the field, celebrating its sixth playoff berth since 2007.
Four Harvard hitters recorded multiple-hit games, and senior Haley Davis hit her sixth home run.
DARTMOUTH 7, HARVARD 6
Dartmouth briefly kept its playoff hopes alive with a win in the first game of Tuesday’s doubleheader.
“They have a very talented roster of hitters, and it was really tough to come up with a game plan for them, but I think the pitchers had really prepared for this all week,” Galindo said.
The Big Green put up four runs in the home half of the sixth to claim a one-run advantage. Senior Katie McEachern sparked the rally with an opposite-field homer to right.
Dartmouth senior starter Morgan McCalmon stayed in the circle to wrap the game up for the home team, setting down Harvard in order.
HARVARD 6, DARTMOUTH 5
The lead changed six times in the Crimson’s final home game of the year, but at the end of the day, a sixth inning home run off the bat of Rich put Harvard up for good.
Dartmouth threatened in the top of the seventh, recording two quick singles after a pop up for the first out of the inning. Sarah Smith had pitched four full innings of relief, so coach Jenny Allard made the call to the bullpen and brought in Groom.
Following a seven-inning performance in game one, the Lowell, Mich., native came on in relief for the final two outs. She struck out the first batter she faced and then induced a ground out to short to secure Harvard’s undefeated home record in 2016.
“We actually didn’t realize that until coach told us after the game, and that’s a huge accomplishment really,” Groom said. “One of our little mantras this year was to protect our house.”
HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 3
A three-run third inning spurred the Crimson on to victory in its first contest with the Big Green of the weekend series.
Despite being thrown out at third trying to stretch a double into a triple, Rich drove in two runners to break the 0-0 tie in the bottom of the third. Kaplan followed with a homer to right field, her second of the year.
At the conclusion of the regular season, Kaplan finished with a batting average of .446, best in the Ancient Eight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forced to watch their opponents celebrate on Senior Day, the Harvard baseball team was left to rue its missed opportunities as its season came to an abrupt end.
Despite Yale losing three games and opening the proverbial door, the Crimson (17-24, 9-11 Ivy) was unable to take advantage and force its way into postseason play, losing three out of four to Dartmouth (18-24, 11-9). The Big Green will travel to Yale on Saturday for a one-game playoff to determine who faces Princeton in the Ivy League Championship Series.
Even with a pair of home runs from sophomore outfielder Connor Quinn, Dartmouth won two close, low-scoring games on Saturday before rain postponed Sunday’s games to Tuesday,  in which Harvard split a pair of 3-1 contests.
“It was definitely tough,” freshman center fielder Ben Skinner said. “We were in the position where we had a chance to control our own destiny, so there’s no one one else to blame, we had it under our control.”
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson bats fell silent once again in Hanover, with three Dartmouth pitchers combining to hold the visitors to one unearned run. Senior second baseman Mitch Klug and Quinn picked up a pair of hits each in the losing effort.
Sophomore starter Ian Miller allowed two runs while striking out four in just three innings, with a combination of five Harvard relievers holding the visitors to just one run over the remaining five innings.
The damage, however, was done early, with runs in the third and fourth innings enough for the Big Green. After the Crimson cut the lead to one in the sixth, Dartmouth added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth before setting down Harvard in the top of the ninth.
HARVARD 3, DARTMOUTH 1
Behind yet another gem from freshman right-hander Kevin Stone, the Crimson picked up its only win of the series, its first in 15 games dating back to 2011-2012 against the Big Green, on Tuesday afternoon. The Connecticut native threw seven innings of one-run ball, with the offense scoring in the third, sixth, and seventh innings.
“I think it was just about getting comfortable,” Stone said, “Just knowing what I’m capable of doing in this league, that’s probably what got me back into my rhythm.”
Klug homered and collected three hits on the day, with the Dartmouth offense putting one across the plate in the bottom of the seventh and failing to mount a full comeback.
DARTMOUTH 2, HARVARD 1
The Big Green outlasted the Crimson in an old-fashioned pitching duel Saturday afternoon. Seniors Beau Sulser and Sean Poppen went head-to-head on Senior Day at O’Donnell Field, with the former doing just enough over seven innings to get the victory.
Poppen put in an impressive outing of his own, striking out four in six and a third innings of two-run balls, but once again the Harvard offense was out of sync. Quinn again rose to the occasion, going 3-for-3 with a consolation home run in the eighth inning, the team’s only run, but it was too little, too late.
A pair of RBI singles in the third and seventh innings were enough for Sulser, who struck out five in seven innings while allowing just one run.
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 1
Despite a record-setting outing from sophomore righty Nick Gruener, the Crimson offense could muster just one run in Saturday’s opening loss. Gruener threw his seventh complete game, the most complete games a Harvard pitcher has thrown in a season since the statistic was first recorded in 2001. The Florida native fanned five while allowing seven base runners in seven innings.
“Anytime you see your pitcher going out there and giving it his all, throwing well, you definitely want to back him up with some run support, but unfortunately we weren’t able to this weekend,” Skinner said.
The Big Green got on the board thanks to a single, wild pitch, and a pair of grounders in the first before tacking on two more in the top of the sixth. Quinn’s home run in the bottom of the seventh was mere consolation for a Crimson offense, which had just two runners in scoring position in the entire game.
