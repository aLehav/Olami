After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Democrats and unaffiliated liberals, the past four years have been a disappointing slog in which Republicans have controlled the political narrative on nearly every major issue.
Healthcare reform became Obamacare, replete with death panels. The debate over the debt ceiling became a criticism of the stimulus package. The recent decision to let states determine welfare work requirements, a proposal that almost sounds Republican, became the dismantling of the American work ethic.
In terms of communication, the Democrats have demonstrated a stunning and stupefying inability to defend themselves against an efficient, ruthless, and effective Republican machine.
These recent losses have created a sizable group of disillusioned Democrats and frustrated independents shocked and dismayed by the party’s incompetence. As a result, many members of the liberal base, from fervent party supporters to liberal centrists, have become politically apathetic.
This is why the Democratic Party could never create a movement parallel to the Tea Party. This is why the Democratic Party could not mobilize the support of the Occupy Movement. And this is why the Democratic Party received a political bludgeoning during the 2010 midterm elections.
If this ineptitude continued, the Democratic Party would cease to matter as a political entity.
Yet, the Democratic National Convention last week showed a party energized, eloquent, and finally ready to rebuff the rhetoric of the Republicans.
It started on Tuesday night with an inspired speech by Massachusetts governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 (Full disclosure: I am currently an intern in the Governor’s press office). In his address, Patrick called for “Democrats to stiffen [their] backbone and stand up for what [they] believe.”
Even better, he actually stated those beliefs in a way that directly countered recent Republican criticisms.
The disillusioned have waited four years for that speech, beginning with the speeches of a certain Presidential candidate whose rhetorical skill seemingly disappeared when he entered the oval office.
The articulation and defense of Democratic ideals then became a major theme of the convention.
President Bill Clinton almost restored the Democratic message singlehandedly, delivering a speech uniquely Clintonian in its length and more substantive on policy than any other in recent memory.
We can criticize the Democratic Party for its message, but we can no longer criticize it for not having one.
However, the restoration of Democratic rhetoric may not change the tone of a campaign marred by deliberately misleading advertisements and blatant distortions of basic facts.
After the Republican nomination of Paul Ryan for vice-president, many pundits proclaimed that the candidates would finally focus on the substantive issues. Unfortunately, that never happened.
Similarly, the re-alignment of Democratic messaging may create a choice between two coherent and substantive political philosophies. That would be a welcome change.
Yet, the public space has already reached a saturation point for political messaging. Between individual politicians, party platforms, and super-PAC advertisements, most people have heard all of the talking points and have either memorized or rejected them.
Hearing those talking points, however, does not necessarily equate to understanding the issues. This election cycle in particular has shown a flagrant disregard for accuracy or clarity.
The new Democratic message may only further add to that confusion. It may copy the unfortunate style of the Republican message, which has become a shell of its original self, providing mere echoes of substantive policy discussion.
There remains a glimmer of hope that the rhetoric of last week’s convention will mark a positive turning point for the Democratic Party. It has finally regained its footing in defense of liberalism. Both parties now have an articulate defense of their respective philosophies.
Politicians can passionately defend and debate their beliefs, like last week’s convention speakers, or they can reduce them to sound bites that preclude any attempt at serious discussion. It may be unfortunately easy to predict the path that they will take.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last fall I caught the bug. With my sister starting work at a bulge-bracket investment bank and my blockmates suiting up for every McKinsey and Morgan Stanley event on campus, I found myself newly fixated on the allure of extreme wealth. Over the course of a few short months, money began to appear to me as the easiest and most attractive measure of success—after all, it is far and away the most quantifiable. For the first time in my life, I added “business” to my set of stock responses to questions about my long-term ambitions.
My lifelong interests in the public sector and academics were minimized and replaced by a baby-faced, well-groomed, and sober penchant for the almighty dollar. Since I still bore some residual left-leaning trepidation about the prospect of working in financial services, I hitched my wagon to the business of technology, that lucrative and vaguely liberal industry where a faithful set of evangelists preach of our imminent salvation at the hands of apps.
I sought out and entered a summer internship on the business side of a fast-growing tech firm based in Paris and San Francisco, which specializes in Facebook applications for big businesses. Many of my fellow interns at the firm had turned down jobs at Boston Consulting Group and Google to work there. It was a hot company. To boot, I was making enough money and was going to walk away with some serious resume padding.
But I hated every minute of it. If there’s anything this internship taught me, it’s that time is not merely a commodity that you can bundle and slap on your resume; you actually have to live it. And if you’re doing something you don’t like, it can be quite unpleasant. Many people in the world are forced to do things they hate simply to survive. Those things are not usually internships, and avoiding them seems to be one of the main attractions of a Harvard education. With that in mind, my daily toil felt particularly absurd. It didn’t take me three weeks to remember that I wasn’t actually a Disciple of Tech Millennialism—that I don’t care one bit about click-through rates or cost per mille and that I’d rather go to graduate school for seven years than spend another month writing about “Return on Investment on Facebook.” And I still had two months of 55-hour workweeks left.
As far as I can tell, I found myself in this predicament because the Harvard environment had brought on a temporary psychosis—a haze under which all aspirations apart from the lucrative were subtly shameful. Perhaps I was just anxious about the prospect of winding up the least wealthy of my blockmates. Or maybe the arms race had exaggerated my competitiveness. Either way, I soon became painfully aware that my internship decision had been motivated by the job I wanted to have rather than the work I actually wanted to do.
So I grew a beard. A nasty, out-of-control beard, which nearly everyone I meet comments on. This beard is my personal, subtle statement that I will not be attending any Bain events this semester—that I will be starting a band and applying to Ph.D. programs when the time comes.
I certainly don’t begrudge anyone who takes a job in tech, banking, or consulting. In fact, I’m happy that there are people who make our markets liquid and our technology useful. But I would warn that there are institutional and cultural pressures at this school which can distort the career decisions of students, leading more of them to pursue work in these industries than otherwise would, even considering their attractive salaries.
Apart from Teach for America, these industries represent the far-and-away best recruitment apparatus around. And, in recruitment, convenience is king. Furthermore, as Anita J Joseph ’12 described in an excellent column last semester, the pressure of simply wanting to eat at the same restaurants as your friends after graduation can be a serious draw to the more lucrative professions.
But we can never forget that every day people fall into careers that leave them unsatisfied and full of what-might-have-beens. The only remedy is personal introspection. And facial hair. So: Grow your beards, mustaches, and soul patches (okay, maybe not soul patches), and figure out what you actually want to do. Women, your facial hair can be figurative. Don’t let the clean-shaven emissaries of the more convenient professions decide for you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, leaders of academic and pre-professional student organizations were welcomed back to campus by the Office of Student Life with an email detailing University policy on the use of Harvard resources for commercial purposes. In theory, the regulation of the use of University-owned property is a reasonable, common-sense measure that protects Harvard’s name and preserves the integrity of student activities on campus. Harvard has a strong legal incentive both to protect the copyright of its name and keep an eye on what happens in the spaces it owns. But some student leaders were understandably disgruntled by the OSL’s excessive, onerous guidelines.
In the past, we have opined that the OSL too often polices student life rather than serving as a cooperative resource for student organizations. Unfortunately, the office’s recent communiqué is an unwelcome continuation of that trend. The unduly ambitious regulations presented in the OSL’s email are unnecessarily burdensome and difficult for students to work with.
Among the guidelines sent to student leaders is a limitation on the commercial use not only of Harvard’s physical property, but also of freshman and House listservs. No student or student organization is permitted to “represent outside groups or products by...promoting their goods and services through Harvard listservs,” the email writes. Under this policy, students who work as student ambassadors for outside companies will not be allowed to promote the company’s products or services on their House or dorm email lists. Harvard-owned or not, residential listservs are among the most frequent and basic ways in which students communicate with one another on a daily basis. They should not be treated in the same way that physical spaces are, and they certainly should not be subject to heavy-handed regulation simply by virtue of being University-operated. The unreasonable restrictions placed upon residential email lists represents just one of the ways in which the OSL is incognizant of the realities of student life.
While it is understandable that the University is concerned with the use of its name in collaboration with for-profit companies, there are ways to address this concern without restricting the use of Harvard spaces. For instance, the OSL could make explicit that Harvard does not endorse any company with which a student organization collaborates and mandate that students clarify this policy at events where third-party organizations are hosted.
Admittedly, students ideally would not be engaged in the pure promotion of commercial products or brands that are not relevant to academic or pre-professional interests or that are unrelated to a student organization’s mission. But the OSL’s role should be not to steer student life in the direction that the University chooses, but to be an advocate for student-organized activities. We call upon the OSL, once again, to support student life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I first arrived at Harvard two years ago, I found a lot of what I had expected as an incoming freshman. I took a life sciences class and worked with entryway friends to learn the amino acids; I played intramural sports and bloodied my nose in a soccer game. I had the requisite freshman experiences of romance and partying; I formed wonderful new friendships.
However, in the background of all of these initial experiences was the fact that my mother had died two years earlier. Although I had hoped to meet other students who had suffered similar losses, I generally found myself managing my grief in solitude.
I knew they must be there: in a class of more than 1500, there had to be other students who had lost a parent, a sibling, or a friend. I wanted to talk to people my age who were also students at Harvard to ask how they coped. How did they respond when a new acquaintance asked, “Are your parents coming for Freshman Parents’ Weekend?” How do you focus on work when you miss someone with more than homesickness, because they aren’t alive anymore?
Hoping to meet other students who had suffered a loss early in life, I seized the opportunity to attend the “Seasons of Grief” workshop at the Bureau of Study Counsel. Although the session itself was very helpful, I felt that I wanted something on a more regular basis. By winter break, I decided to go ahead and start a grief support group at Harvard. I was sure it would help other students at Harvard, but it was going to help me as well.
This past spring semester, Students of Actively Moving Forward at Harvard College, a chapter of a national organization, held its first support group meeting. Throughout the semester, we held weekly support group meetings, complete with cookies and tissues. Since I cry easily, I had imagined that a support group would involve en masse sobbing, but AMF has never been like that. We have conversations that might touch on many different topics or stick closely to one or two. The underlying fuel for conversation is often the satisfying, validating response, “I know what you mean” or, “I’ve felt that way too.” At AMF, it is a relief to find others who can empathize, since it is the often-unspoken painful fact of loss that has brought us together.
A death in the community should also bring us together. We learned of the death of Cote K. Laramie ’14 as a community of students, staff, and faculty, and now this community faces grief together. I knew Cote only casually through a student group, so I am not qualified to write a tribute to him. However, I know that his memory will stay with us: We will be reminded of him when we pass by Pforzheimer House, when we go to Glee Club concerts, when my class graduates with one fewer student among us. Many of us will grieve Cote deeply, and it is our responsibility as a community to support one another.
Fortunately, there are many resources for Harvard students who are going through an emotionally difficult experience. I explored a variety of support resources as a freshman when I needed help with my grief for my mother. If you are grieving, I encourage you to talk to your proctor, Peer Advising Fellow, tutor, or House Student Mental Health Liaison to find a resource that would be a good match for you.
No one expects to lose a parent, a sibling, or a friend before they graduate from college. Sadly, grief and loss are among us. Cote’s passing illuminates that bereavement is something college students face, along with all the other stresses of these four years in our lives. I realize that a peer support group is not how every grieving student will want to take care of him or herself. Now that AMF exists, though, I hope fewer Harvard students will feel that they must manage their grief in solitude as I did my freshman year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 11, 2012, at 9:13 p.m.
Though the wine was noticeably absent from the first meeting of the Harvard College Wine Society, more than 50 students snacked on grapes and cider at the introductory meeting for the newly-founded student group.
Dressed in cocktail dresses, button-down shirts, and ties, members of the board presented their vision for the club, which is geared mostly toward seniors and includes monthly wine tastings for the fall semester.
“I joke to my friends it’s a drinking club, but it is so much more than that,” said Shiya Wang ’13, the president and founder of the society.
During the tastings, members will learn about the different types of wines from different regions and will have the opportunity to sample six wines.
The group has also sought the help of Emma A. Limon ’13, who has previously worked on a goat farm, for guidance on wine and cheese pairings.
In addition to the wine tasting events, the Wine Society will also host a year-end gala with the Food Literacy Project.
In order to join the society, members must pay 35 dollars per semester, which will help to pay for the wines and wine classes over the course of the term.
“We hope this doesn’t discourage anyone from joining,” said co-vice president Nataliya Nedzhvetskaya ’13-14, a Crimson editor on the editorial board. She added she encourages anyone concerned about the dues to reach out to her.
Some students who attended the event, including Alexandra M. Harsacky ’13, said the price is a bit steep and may factor into her decision to join. However, Harsacky added that a bonus of the Wine Society is that it will bring the senior class together.
Given that the Wine Society is a recognized student organization, it will not serve alcohol to minors and will be checking identification at the entrance to the tastings. Wang said she faced some challenges while trying to establish the organization because the administration was concerned that the Wine Society would promote binge drinking.
However, Wang said the Wine Society hopes to do the opposite and teach students how to drink responsibly.
“I think if people appreciate wine as a form of art, then they will treat it differently,” Wang said. “They will drink more responsibly at more appropriate occasions than get wasted on a weekend night with friends.”
The Wine Society will also ask members to sign waivers saying that the club is not responsible for students’ behavior or actions that may occur after the tastings, Wang said.
Wang, who has worked on a vineyard in Bordeaux and for a wine consulting and market research firm, said her experience in the wine industry will help her lead the classes. She also plans to invite guest speakers to participate.
At press time, Wang said that 150 people had expressed interest in joining the club. Wang said she expects that number to grow as the group continues to publicize over house email lists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several final clubs and other student organizations canceled parties during the first weekend back at school as rumors swirled about a planned police crackdown on underage drinking.
Though neither the Harvard University Police Department nor the Cambridge Police Department made any public announcement about increased weekend policing, undergraduates swapped wild stories to explain their caution about partying—ranging from a supposed cocaine sting in a final club to Harvard’s possible concern over bad press after two summer sexual assaults and a major cheating scandal.
The rumors were enough to deter many clubs, and though both HUPD and CPD representatives did not respond to requests for comments over the weekend, a significantly higher than usual number of Cambridge police officers lined Mt. Auburn Street, home to most of the final clubs, on Friday and Saturday nights.
The officers administered Breathalyzer tests to students and asked them to pour their drinks into the street. The police log which would indicate whether any students were arrested for underage drinking had not been published as of press time.
Stephanie L. Newman ’13, the publisher of the Advocate, repeated the rumors in an email to the literary magazine staff cancelling a planned party on Saturday. “The College is cracking down on parties this weekend and calling in the Cambridge Police to monitor instead of HUPD. The word on the street is that they're trying to look for a partying organization with underage drinking to make a bad example of,” she wrote. “It's not worth losing funding or building privileges for a bottle of wine.”
As off-campus organizations, the eight property-owning male final clubs are not under the jurisdiction of HUPD. But students say they have come to expect that the Cambridge police will keep their distance.
Parties in students’ rooms were not exempt from the perceived scrutiny over the weekend. Some theorized that the move of about 180 Quincy House students into three Harvard Square apartment buildings while the House undergoes renovations may have been a factor.
The swing housing is located in areas that are not occupied solely by Harvard students, as Quincy residents live above commercial outlets like J. P. Licks and Grolier Poetry Bookshop.
On Friday night, a party in Quincy swing space Hampden Hall, at 8 Plympton Street, was broken up by the Cambridge police. According to Tankersley, a neighbor, the officers came in after interrogating students on the sidewalk outside.
Fellow Quincy swing housing resident Rachel J. Sapire ’15 commented, “I think HUPD is generally capable at doing what they set out to do, so I guess I really don’t see why [the Cambridge police] would be necessary.”
Students said they wondered whether the fear of partying would continue to dampen social life as the semester continues.
Alaina A. Alvarez ’15 said that the police presence will not deter underage drinking for long. “I think that it’s going to happen regardless of whether or not they crack down,” she said.
But Kyle O. McIntee ’15 felt confident that Harvard had chosen the right policing tactics. “Whatever the University deems right is probably right,” he said.

After Harvard issues verdicts to the roughly 125 undergraduates being investigated for academic dishonesty in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress,” several lawyers predict that the University could face a slew of lawsuits from students facing punishment.
One student currently under investigation said he may consider suing Harvard, depending on the outcome of his case. He said that he has already contacted a lawyer and has spoken to about ten others accused of academic dishonesty who have done the same.
“Harvard has created this war between the students and the fricking school, and this is a war that I am willing and very eager to fight,“ said the student, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not want it known that he is accused of cheating.
Lawyers and experts who specialize in higher education law said they expect that any students who choose to sue the University are most likely to claim that the Administrative Board did not properly follow its procedures as listed in the student handbook during the Government 1310 investigation.
These lawsuits could have merit if Harvard  “substantially” deviates from its delineated processes during the investigation, said Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law. While administrative mistakes, such as misnumbered pages in procedural documents, will be unlikely to generate successful lawsuits, he said, students could have a valid legal case if administrators make more egregious errors, such as the denial of promised hearings.
Lake added that he thinks problems could arise from the unusually high volume of students implicated in the investigation.
“Particularly with 125 matters to resolve, it takes a lot of diligence to make sure that [all of the students] get what they’re supposed to get,” Lake said. “It gets that much more likely that you’re going to make a mistake.”
Harvard could also face a number of lawsuits from punished students claiming that their future job prospects have been jeopardized, said Michael R. Schneider, a Boston lawyer who has acted as a consultant for students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Medical School, and Law School facing Ad Board processes.
Potential punishments issued at the conclusion of the investigation, such as withdrawal, will always appear on students’ transcripts and may impact their likelihood of being accepted at graduate schools or hired for a job.
“I think the University needs to realize that it is really making it difficult for some really solid students who may have had one lapse in their academic careers,” Schneider said.
Students who say they have lost jobs or other opportunities as a result of being falsely accused of plagiarism could also sue the University for intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, Boston education lawyer Laura E. Gillis said.
But it will be difficult to prove that the University was sloppy in carrying out its investigation, or that Harvard intentionally caused emotional harm, Schneider said.
Experts interviewed for this article also said that Harvard can take preventative measures while the investigation is still ongoing to defend itself from these possible suits.
In response to these possible lawsuits, the University should be careful to draw a clear line separating collaboration from cheating, said Robert Holmes, president of the Association for Student Conduct Administrators.
“There’s a difference between similar answers and copied answers,” Holmes said.
The Ad Board should also ensure that each student is investigated and prosecuted as an individual, Schneider said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Days before Saturday’s season opener against the University of San Diego, the Harvard football team is grappling with the ramifications of the Government 1310 cheating scandal.
“With the whole investigation going on, we realize that there are possibilities that our team is going to miss a few players,” said one member of the football team, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson since he said he feared punishment from his coaches.
Though the Administrative Board’s investigation may last for several months, the football team has already taken actions internally which included a discussion of the issue at a recent team meeting.
“Coaches are taking certain steps to prepare us for the worst,” said another player, also granted anonymity by The Crimson.
Punishments for academic dishonesty can either maintain or remove a student’s “good standing” at the College.
Sanctions that do not change a student’s status at the College, and which would not affect a varsity athlete’s ability to compete, include a grade reduction, a failing grade on the assignment in question, or a transcript mark equivalent to no credit for the course.
But sanctions that do take a student out of “good standing,” and which may jeopardize a varsity athlete’s season, include a probationary period or a requirement to withdraw.
Some football players have said that coaches, expecting the loss of at least one major contributor on offense, are beginning to rethink strategy and the starting lineup. The reshuffling has also created opportunities for other players to assume greater roles on the team.
“[As a result of the investigation], there are guys at all positions on this team who are getting a chance to step up when they’re handed that ball,” said a different player on the team, also granted anonymity by The Crimson. “It’s a good opportunity for them to be able to contribute to the team in some way.”
Harvard coach Timothy L. Murphy declined to comment on the investigation Thursday, and Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise, and Director of Athletic Communications Kurt K. Svoboda could not be reached for comment Sunday evening.
In an internal email between College administrators obtained by The Crimson—which one resident dean confirmed was sent to others of the resident deans—Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison issued recommendations to his colleagues on how to advise athletes implicated in the scandal.
He wrote that varsity athletes involved in the investigation should weigh potential Ivy League eligibility issues when deciding whether or not to remain on campus for the fall term.
Typically, if a player takes part in athletic competition before being asked to take a leave of absence by the Ad Board, the player loses a full season of Ivy League eligibility regardless of what point in the season the player was disciplined. Ivy League athletes are only granted four seasons of eligibility.
“Fall term athletes may also want to consider taking [a leave of absence] before their first game,” Ellison wrote in the email.
More than half of the government class played varsity sports, estimated a member of the Class of 2012 accused of cheating in the course. The student was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he said he feared repercussions from Harvard for discussing the case.
It remains unclear how long the investigations, which are being conducted on a case-by-case basis, will take. But another student under review was told by Ellison in a personal meeting that he should expect his verdict by November.
The football team, therefore, would be forced to deal with this uncertainty for much of the season, which concludes against Yale on Nov. 17.
“We’ve come together more...and realized that this is the group that we’ve got, and we have to make the best of it,” one of the players said. “If we can’t, then it’s going to be a long season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We’re sorry to break the news, but summer is over. That means it’s time to unpack those boxes, say awkward hellos to those freshman-year roommates, cry yourself to sleep in Lamont, and read The Back Page.
Okay, so we lied about people reading The Back Page. But if there’s one thing that Harvard students read, it’s Twitter, which has been buzzing with back-to-school fever.
During the past week, students have posted countless tweets in celebration of their return to Cambridge. Harvard’s athletes are no exception.
We’ve compiled our favorite back-to-school tweets in this year’s first Tweet of the Week. We know you’ve been waiting three months for this.
1) Sophomore basketball star Temi Fagbenle had a great summer, but that is starting to feel like ancient history. The Crimson forward tweeted this after a frustrating night:
Great....Lie in bed at 9pm doing work.....wake up at 3am...*sigh*...the ‪#collegestruggles have begun.
Look, we understand. It’s tough going from the Olympic Village to Quincy House. Who wants to go from LeBron James and Michael Phelps to those un-athletic brainiacs down the hall? Jet lag is tough, but this will take some time. You have our sympathy.
2) For some reason, joining a national team seems to correlate with first week struggles. Men’s basketball’s Laurent Rivard posted this on Twitter at the end of last week:
I probably should try to find my ID so I can eat in the dhall...
We remember when we were freshmen. Did you forget your Harvard lanyard, too? But wait, it gets better. Days later, Rivard shared this epiphany with his followers:
Why does every hard class at Harvard starts with "Introduction to ..."
So by that logic, do all the easy classes start with “Advanced?” And is “intermediate” still intermediate? We’re going to go ahead and rearrange our schedules now…
3) Rivard’s teammate, Christian Webster, is a little more sensible.  The junior guard feels strongly about his dining options:
Back to the dhall food --____--
The history books will remember this as the face that launched a thousand students into the Cambridge restaurants. Your move, HUDS.
Those are the Tweets of the Week. Assuming that at least one person reads this post, it should be the first of many. Check back next week when you need a break from those impossible introduction courses!

The Harvard men’s soccer team’s comeback attempt fell just short on Sunday afternoon, as the Crimson lost, 3-2, in double-overtime to Southern Methodist University at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
The Crimson (1-2-1) entered the second half down two goals but battled back to tie the game with ten minutes remaining. But  Harvard was unable to put away a game-winner, and the Mustangs (2-2-1) capitalized in the 105th minute to secure the win.
"I thought we showed a lot of character and pride...so we’ve got to take positives from this for sure," Harvard coach Carl Junot said.
Sunday’s matchup was the Crimson’s first against SMU—or a member of Conference USA—in program history.
The Mustangs, who were ranked in the top 25 earlier this season, visited Cambridge coming off a 2-1 defeat of Dartmouth in Hanover on Friday.
"We’ve seen them play a lot, [and] they have a definitive style of play," Junot said. "They are a really possession-based, technical team, so we had a game plan going into it.… We tried to sit a little deeper to absorb that pressure and then counterattack with our strength and speed."
The Crimson found success with the approach early in the match, dominating possession and outshooting the Mustangs, 6-0, in the first 18 minutes. But SMU found the net on its first shot of the contest.
In the 19th minute, forward Ben Hill collected a pass in the center of the box, faked out Harvard keeper Joe Festa, and slotted the ball into the left corner of the net to put the Mustangs on the board.
With just six seconds remaining in the half, SMU doubled its lead after Jacob Gandarilla tapped in a rebound off a Festa block.
"I think people were pretty frustrated [at the half]," said co-captain Scott Prozeller, whose squad went into the break with an 11-6 edge in shots. "We were down, 2-0, but I think people also realized we had been playing well and that we could definitely compete with this team."
The Harvard offense was rewarded about fifteen minutes into the second-half when Prozeller headed in a free kick that sophomore defender David Barna curved into the box from the right side of the field.
Twenty minutes later, the Crimson scored the equalizer on another set piece. After an SMU defender cleared Barna’s corner kick to the top of the box, freshman midfielder Oliver White was there to fire the ball back into the top of the net for his first collegiate goal.
With the match tied, both teams increased their intensity, but both offenses came up empty handed, forcing a pair of golden-goal, ten-minute overtime periods.
In the first overtime, the Mustangs had a chance to finish the game when the referee called an incidental handball in the box and awarded SMU a penalty kick with about a minute left. But Mustang sophomore Tyler Engel shot the ball into the upper crossbar, missing his opportunity to end the match.
With just five minutes remaining, Engel redeemed himself by netting the game-winner for the Mustangs. He received a back-heel pass from a teammate in the box and capitalized on a one-on-one with the keeper to send Harvard home empty-handed.
The Crimson created many offensive opportunities, outshooting SMU, 21-14, and topping its opponent in corner kicks, 11-5, but came short of completing its comeback. Festa recorded seven saves in his first career start in goal.
"We dug ourselves into a hole in the first half," Prozeller said, "[but] I thought we did well. We challenged well, came out in the second half, and came back. I thought we had the run of play and gave up a pretty soft goal, but they were a good team."
"We have to score more goals than we concede, obviously, but I thought we created enough offense to have won the game," Junot said. "I thought we had the better of a lot of the game, but that’s not soccer. Wins and losses come off of individual play, and they had some good stuff."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For large periods of the second half of Sunday’s game against No. 17 Boston College, the Harvard field hockey team played even with its more heralded opponents. But the Crimson was unable to convert its bevy of offensive chances into goals to surmount an early deficit, ultimately falling, 3-0, at Jordan Field.
The first half was entirely controlled by the Eagles, who outshot Harvard, 15-2, and amassed seven penalty corners to the Crimson’s zero, looking the part of a nationally-ranked power with sure touches, brisk passes, and large stretches of possession.
Boston College opened the scoring just five minutes into the game. Crisp back-and-forth passing moved the Eagles into the circle and won them a penalty corner, which was promptly dispatched off a redirection by Boston College’s Chapin Duke over the outstretched left arm of goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos.
The Eagles doubled their advantage with just under four minutes remaining in the half, as Emma Plasteras played a neat one-two in the circle with teammate Nicole Shuster, found an empty pocket of space upon receiving the return pass, and slapped the ball high over the shoulder of Tassopoulos from close range.
Harvard’s first-half chances were limited to a shot each from sophomore Kaitlyn Boudah and junior Caitlin Rea, both of which sailed wide of the goal. The Crimson’s attack simply could not build up effectively from the midfield, not connecting on the many long passes played down the wings.
But Harvard came out of the break—and a spirited huddle—with renewed energy. From the start of the period, the Crimson’s counterattack worked with particular effectiveness, as the Harvard forwards broke quickly down the field after winning the ball back from Boston College in the midfield.
"That’s what changed [between the halves]: the energy and the work rate that everyone was willing to do for each other," coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. "If we’re not careful and just go for it, I think we’re going to be a very good team. We just have to be a little bit more fortunate and a little more effective in the circle."
It was the lack of that finishing touch in the circle that prevented the Crimson from mounting a serious comeback. The Harvard forwards created a number of odd-man rushes off the counterattack and managed four shots on net, but Eagles goalkeeper Leah Settipane stopped them all. Other times, promising moves were negated by a poor touch in the circle, whether on a mishandled pass or a failure to challenge the defense on penalty corners.
"It comes down to practice," van Herwaarden said. "We just have to keep coming out here working hard and understand the differences we have to make. It’s about the details: a little footwork, getting a little bit stronger, doing things a little bit faster, and that’s all about practice."
Near the end of the second half, Boston College added its final goal, a soft deflection by AshLeigh Sebia off of a penalty corner. Still, the Crimson was encouraged by its ability to get the upper hand, even for a brief spell, on a team of Boston College’s caliber.
"We wanted to come out like we had nothing to lose and give them a great game, and I thought that we did it," sophomore Noel Painter said. "I don’t think the score reflects how we played. We gave them a run for their money."
Despite the signs of life on offense, Harvard has struggled to put points on the scoreboard. The Crimson has scored just two goals in four games this season. But Painter was not worried, saying that the breaks would eventually go her team’s way.
"We weren’t able to convert, but that’s the next step, being able to put it in the cage," Painter said. "Part of being a forward is having amnesia, forgetting about all the misses, but I just need to stay focused and stay confident and the balls will go in."
Tassopoulos made her second straight appearance in goal after junior Jenn Hatfield started in her place against Sacred Heart on Sept. 3, but van Herwaarden said that he has not yet made a final decision on a starter for the duration of the season, though he plans to do so in the near future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After opening its weekend at the Princeton Invitational with a win on Friday night, the Harvard men’s water polo team (3-4) could not fend off its opponents on Saturday and Sunday, dropping the final three games of the tournament.
Giving up first-half runs to three straight opponents, the Crimson could not recover in the tournament’s final games, including two against ranked foes in No. 13 Princeton and No. 3 California.
But the tournament did showcase the talent of the underclassmen, who led the team’s attack all weekend.
“We are a young team, so there’s a lot of maturity that needs to be developed,” junior co-captain Will Roller said. “But we are only two weeks in. Progress has been made, certainly, but I don’t think anyone on the team is happy with our record and our performance in the games. We all know we can do a lot better, and everyone is willing to work and put in the time for that.”
Freshman Blake Lee led the way offensively with 11 goals on the weekend.
“[The freshmen] are truly an impact class,” Roller said said. “[Lee] stepped up this weekend, [freshman] Noah Harrison the weekend before. Overall, there is a lot of speed [in the freshman class], and that’s improving our game because we are able to swim with a team…that in years past had been able to counterattack us up and down the pool.”
Lee believes the weekend’s effect on team chemistry will pay dividends down the road.
“We have so much potential and talent after these past two weekends,” he said. “I’m really excited for the rest of the season and looking forward for what we can do.”
JOHNS HOPKINS 8, HARVARD 5
In the final matchup of the weekend, Harvard took on a veteran Johns Hopkins squad. After giving up an early run to its opponent, Harvard was unable to pull even despite a third-quarter rally, falling 8-5.
For the third straight game, Harvard surrendered a first-half run, as the Blue Jays raced out to a 6-2 lead by the end of the first two periods.
The Crimson responded in the third, shutting out the Johns Hopkins offense and scoring two goals of its own. But the Blue Jays retook the momentum, outpacing the Crimson, 2-1, in the final frame.
Freshman Blake Lee finished with two goals, bringing his season total to 22.
NO. 3 CALIFORNIA 13, HARVARD 7
After keeping pace with one of the nation’s best squads in the first period, the Crimson surrendered debilitating runs preceding and following halftime, and the the Bears (5-0) handed Harvard its second Saturday defeat to a ranked opponent.
Underclassmen continued to lead the Crimson attack, accounting for all seven of the team’s strikes. Sophomore Max Murphy led the offense with three goals in the game.
After some inconsistent play against Princeton earlier in the day, Roller was happy with his team’s mindset in the second part of the Saturday doubleheader
“[Cal] is the third-ranked team in the country, and we were able to play with them,” Roller said. “It was much more of a consistent game, and we were able to maintain our intensity.”
NO. 13 PRINCETON 13, HARVARD 7
A strong second half from the Crimson could not erase an early deficit, as Harvard lost its first game of the weekend to the Tigers, 13-7, on Saturday.
Princeton (3-2) caught the Crimson on its heels early, taking a five-point lead by the end of the first half. Harvard kept pace in the second, but was unable to make a run of its own.
“Princeton came out hard, and we all kind of went, ‘Oh, no,’” Roller said. “Once we brought our composure back it was a much more reasonable game. It’s neck-and-neck if you take out that first quarter.”
HARVARD 13, CAL LUTHERAN 5
Harvard opened the Princeton Invitational with a dominating display against the Kingsmen (1-3), as a freshman-led attack spurred the team to a 13-5 win.
Lee scored a game-high five goals while classmate Ben Zepfel added two of his own and an assist.
Roller praised Zepfel for his contributions and his ability to create chances for his teammates.
“He has come in and is dominating the two-meter for us offensively,” Roller said. “Specifically, his work in there is opening up a lot of outside shots for guys like [Lee], [Murphy], and [Harrison]. That is a crucial element to have the dual threat from inside and outside.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second time in as many contests, the Harvard women’s soccer team left the field on Sunday down 1-0 at halftime.
Just two days prior in Cambridge, Harvard had found itself trailing 1-0 at the break to Dayton, and despite a strong effort in the second half, the Crimson fell, 3-1, for its first loss of the season.
But Sunday proved to be a different story as Harvard scored three unanswered goals to win, 3-1, in Hamilton, N.Y.
“It wasn’t like we had a major tactical error that led to [Colgate’s] goal or in the half overall,” junior co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “But in the locker room, we all just realized that we all needed to be on the same page. In the second half, we all came out pressuring all together.”
Colgate (5-3-1) opened up the match with better goal-scoring opportunities. With the Raiders pressing deep into Crimson (2-1-1) territory at the 22nd minute, Colgate nearly registered its first goal of the match when forward Jillian Kinter’s one-touch pass found the feet of teammate Catherine Williams. But Williams was denied by the back post, keeping the game scoreless.
The Crimson was not as fortunate towards the end of the first half. With less than four minutes remaining in the frame, Williams, despite heavy pressure, delivered a cross into the Crimson penalty box, and Kinter summarily finished off the pass with a header into the back of the net for the goal.
Coming out of the break, Harvard immediately took control of the match with a newfound vigor both on the offensive and defensive ends of the pitch.
On the offensive side of the ball, the Crimson finally broke through the Raiders’ back line.
Defensively, Harvard contained Colgate’s dynamic duo of Kinter and Williams, limiting the home team’s scoring opportunities.
During the second half, after just four minutes, the Crimson’s offensive pressure led to two consecutive corner kick opportunities. On the second corner, with Johnson delivering the corner kick, senior midfielder Aisha Price’s header on goal gave Harvard its first goal of the match and levelled the score at one goal apiece.
The Crimson grabbed a 2-1 lead at the 67th minute of play when a defensive slip-up by Colgate during a Harvard counterattack allowed junior forward Elizabeth Weisman to thread a pass across the box to sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke. With just the keeper to beat, Urke finished from 12 yards out to put the Crimson ahead, 2-1.
With 15 minutes to play, despite a furious attempt by the Raiders to tie the game once again, Harvard extended its lead to two goals when sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby broke through the Colgate defense into the penalty box and shot past the Raiders goalkeeper.
Finding itself down two goals with less than 10 minutes remaining on the clock, Colgate fought to close the scoreline by maintaining consistent pressure on the Crimson backline until the final moments of the match. Though the Raiders threatened, Harvard held strong and finished with a 3-1 victory.
For the Crimson, despite the two-goal victory over Colgate, this match in many ways was a tale of two halves.
“We came out in the first half not as energized as we should have,” sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten said. “But in the second half we came out with a change in mentality. At the end of the game all of us were all just like—wow, that was really fun. It was just so much fun to go out there in the second half, all of us energized and on the same page connecting passes so smoothly.”
Maintaining the same level of intensity of play is therefore the primary aim of Harvard heading into Wednesday’s road game against Quinnipiac.
“We are going to be looking to connect passes the way we did in the second half, but for a full 90 minutes,” Johnson said. “Maintaining composure from the get-go is also a working point for us.
“But I also believe that what allowed us to maintain such great offense was our great defense today,” Johnson added. “If we can continue to build on that this week, we should be in good shape going forward.”

Did you spend the weekend inside, wistfully wondering where the summer went?
Well, thanks to the Sunday Parkland Games, you can enjoy the last weeks of humidity and visible grass with a side of downward dog. Hosted by the Charles River Conservancy and the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the games run on Sundays (concluding on September 30th) from 2-5 p.m. near the Week's footbridge.
"It's a pretty diverse crowd. I've seen everyone from our little one to 5 or 6 year olds," Jamie L. Cochran, the wife of a Harvard Business School student, said as a child wailed in the background.
Set apart from the families sitting near abstract toys, Michelle A. Chang '14 and her blockmates tossed a frisbee around. She hadn't heard that the games were going on, but appreciated that they brought people out.
"It's such a nice day. We decided it's good to get out and enjoy the sunshine while it lasts," Chang said.
So even though the average age may be a bit lower than we're used to here on campus, there are games available and free yoga offered from 4-5 p.m.

At about 4:20 p.m. on Monday, the Cambridge Fire Department responded to a smoking trash can at the corner of JFK St. and South St. They took the trash can apart and extinguished the fire.
One firefighter, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because firefighters are not allowed to talk to the press, said that the fire was caused by "excessive heat in a barrel."
Another suggested the fire may have been a result of a passerby throwing a lit cigarette butt into the trash can.
