After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once again, conservatives are banking on faux-populism. Over the past few weeks, Republican senators and their brain trust have attempted to shift public opinion on consumer financial protection proposals by deriding them as elitist. This week on bigthink.com—a popular education website—Peter J. Wallison, a Financial Policy Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argued that the Democrats’ proposal for a Consumer Financial Protection Agency is condescending because it implies that Americans are incapable of understanding complex financial products on their own. Wallison used this same rhetoric in a Washington Post editorial last summer, and unfortunately the idea has found its way onto the GOP congressional website, as well as political consultant Frank Luntz’s notorious February memo to Republicans on how to fight financial reform in general.
It’s the oldest trick in the book. When progressives argue that conservatives defend a dangerous status quo, conservatives counter that progressives condescend to Americans who are perfectly capable of watching out for themselves. Because they have difficulty attacking the content of reform, they portray the tone of the legislation as demeaning and thus culturally repulsive. They eschew meaningful debate by realigning themselves with a shallow conception of the American Dream.
In reality, Wallison and company’s arguments are nothing but smokescreens for fleecing consumers. A consumer financial protection entity, such as Senator Chris Dodd’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—or the even more robust CFPA proposed by Representative Barney Frank—would do much to defend American families and small businesses from financial ruin. The proposal is anything but elitist—and it’s supported by an overwhelming majority of the American public: A Monday poll by the Consumer Federation of America found that 62 percent of Americans support the creation of a "new federal agency to protect consumers who purchase banking and other financial services."
There is currently minimal regulation on the consumer credit market. What regulation does exist is rarely enforced. Several federal agencies—including the Federal Reserve and the Federal Trade Commission—are charged with the task of consumer protection, yet they have little accountability. Elizabeth Warren, chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel of the Troubled Assets Relief Program and former Dean of Harvard Law School, notes that under the status quo regulators compete for clients and thus inevitably form cozy relationships with the firms they regulate. Among other problems, many firms house their operations in individual states, thus evading federal regulation entirely.
One result of lax oversight is that many financial products are loosely uninspected—this makes American households more prone to fall into bankruptcy and more subject to financial abuse. A consumer financial protections institution would have the authority to regulate new products, terminate abusive lending practices, and pursue financial fraud. This would not only defend consumers and small businesses but also help the financial sector accomplish what it is meant to do: connect borrowers and lenders in order to increase the productivity of the real economy.
Although conservatives argue that we shouldn’t be regulating financial products merely because they’re complicated, we already have and we already do, for good reason. The notion that we should have more regulations on products that are more complicated and potentially harmful isn’t novel. As Mike Konczal at the Roosevelt Institute notes, most of the financial instruments products that played a major role in the sub-prime mortgage crisis were illegal before 1982. Despite what folks like Wallison may claim, this will not be the first time the government ensure that a large sector of the economy “den[ies] products and services to a large proportion of the population.” For example, most consumers quietly depend on the FDA to regulate food and medicine. Most Americans agree that the “freedom” to consume something that is likely to harm them isn’t always valuable in and of itself.
Over the coming months, conservatives will try to take advantage of the anti-elitist anger burning through America. They’ll vilify bureaucratic elites while turning a blind eye to the dangerous deeds of financial elites. So far, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among other groups, has spent $3 million on fighting consumer financial protection. The White House, along with heroines like Elizabeth Warren, is responding appropriately by accusing conservatives of defending Wall Street interests. Given the overwhelming number of Americans who just want a fair handshake, one would think Republican senators and their intellectual associates would stop siding with Big Finance. Yet conservatives, perhaps cleverly so, seem more interested in securing funds from Wall Street than representing the interests of their constituents.  As the fight continues we can expect them to disingenuously portray most pieces of financial reform as  recipes for further bailouts and elitist government expansion. After all, sometimes you just can’t teach the Grand Old Party new tricks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve been a woman for over twenty years now. I’ve been in all kinds of final clubs—the Fox, the Owl, the Spee, the Kong, the Quad Dance Complex—and I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
Still, every so often, be it during the fall punch season or at that time of spring when the Smoke Monster materializes in Quincy House, people begin to clamor for the admission of women to final clubs. This always reminds me of a quote from Stokely Carmichael. Asked whether there were any positions for women in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, he responded: “The only position for women in SNCC is prone." Let women into final clubs? Sure—on Saturday nights, if we’re wearing those outfits that make us look like someone poured us into our clothes and we forgot to say “When.” That’s how it’s been for more than two hundred years, when you could only get into the Fly as a woman if you exposed your ankles, no matter how good at needle-pointing you were. And that’s how it should be. If God had wanted women to be in final clubs, he would have created us first.
There are usually two sides to the final club debate. One side argues that gender equality is here and that it’s not going away any time soon, so Harvard final clubs should cave and do what their equivalents at Yale and Princeton have already done. Since when are we following Yale’s and Princeton’s leads? Give them an inch, and we’ll wake up one morning to find ourselves in an extremely unsafe neighborhood where we can’t walk at night without being accosted by people wearing shorts with sea creatures on them who beat us up with eating clubs or something like that. I believe in gender equality—because I enjoy carrying heavy boxes up five flights of stairs by myself—but I’m not sure why that means that women have to enjoy the same social privileges as men.
The other side points out that men and women are, somehow, inherently different. I’m not sure how, but next year I’ll be auditing Cultures of Reproduction, so I’ll be able to update you. This side says that women and men have separate needs. You don’t see women in final clubs, and you don’t see men grabbing everything off the shelves of that one aisle at CVS and pouring into the Women’s Center on Friday nights. Apparently, Harvard men have needs that only gender-segregated final clubs are equipped to fill.
This makes sense. Admittedly, I’ve never been upstairs at the Fox, but I just know that when I get there it’ll be a giant room filled with urinals and other manly things like two guys hugging it out or one guy standing there not talking about his feelings. “Good thing this is a male-only space!” I will exclaim. “Please, take me back downstairs, where I belong.”
It’s not that I’m an anti-feminist. Far from it. If I shook hands with a feminist, we would both still exist. I believe in equal rights for men and women. But I understand that final club membership is not a right. It is a privilege. Why should women and men have equal privileges too? What is this, the 23rd century? Let’s slow down! We women have lots of things to keep us busy until then, like founding La Vie, or joining La Vie, or repeatedly wandering into the La Vie punch cocktails that were held in my common room while pretending to be an angry axolotl. Sure, final clubs might be great social networks, but we’ve got Facebook. They might have delicious food and bonding, but we have those HUDS chicken parmesans and the French language table. They might have party spaces and alumni connections, but we have childbirth! Besides, they say that from those to whom much has been given, much is expected. We don’t want to have to deal with those expectations! We want to do it the hard way, like our ancestors did, by working their way to the top and then being burned at the stake as witches.
Besides, the parties aren’t even that great. I remember one party at the Delphic where someone offered me punch, and I woke up several weeks later in Equatorial Guinea with a great tan, surrounded by fun individuals who were only kind of involved in human trafficking. The most awkward part was that I couldn’t remember anyone’s names. “You!” I would say. “T-shirt Guy Who Drives The Truck! Tell Man Whose Hooded Sweatshirt Makes Him Look Like a Sex Offender to get Papa Roach’s attention!” My efforts to get them to reveal more about their identities as we moved slowly across country were less fruitful. “Hey, T-Shirt Guy,” I would say. “Did you have any other nicknames growing up, nicknames that were, for example, based upon your true name?” He would shrug and mutter under his breath, I assume something along the lines of, “dang it, we should just let women into our final clubs already.”
But I’m a woman. I don’t presume.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, Boston Public Schools Superintendent Carol R. Johnson announced a bold plan to revamp 12 underperforming schools, provoking sharp public resistance from the Boston Teachers Union. The most controversial measures include calling for teachers to work dozens of extra hours without compensation, rescinding layoff and seniority benefits, and linking annual pay raises to job performance. Although we believe that Johnson’s proposal that teachers work extra hours without increased pay is counterproductive, agreeing to union demands to scrap all the reform measures entirely will not improve the quality of teaching in the schools. BPS should instead focus on implementing Johnson’s suggested pay-for-performance plan, which will show teachers that their performance is valued on an individual level and encourage them to focus on improving their own work.
One reason why we oppose extending teacher hours without extra compensation is that the policy seeks to improve teachers by punishing them rather than providing an incentive to improve. In addition, it unfairly burdens teachers who lead extra-curricular activities, have families to care for, or work second jobs. We cannot expect teachers to thoroughly and enthusiastically teach in the classroom if they are not paid adequately for their work and feel their time is not adequately appreciated.
Additionally, Johnson’s proposal targets 12 of Boston's most underperforming schools where teachers already face tremendous obstacles. BPS can’t afford to discourage bright teachers who want to help struggling students from joining the schools where they are most needed. Mandating more training and more time spent teaching without any compensation is especially dangerous in schools where morale is already extremely low.
Instead, an incentive system is the most fair and straightforward way to provide motivation for teachers of varying experience to go above and beyond the 40-hour work week, experiment with innovative teaching methods, provide additional resources and time to students, reinforce existing success in the classroom, and distinguish good teaching from bad. Reduced seniority provisions could work to offset new performance bonuses, as Johnson suggested.
Highly effective teaching should be the goal, and shabby instruction that handicaps students is simply unacceptable. Currently, union contracts make it notoriously difficult for school officials to take underperforming teachers out of the classroom, except in the most egregious cases. If providing a better education for all students is the goal, then new reform must also make it easier for school officials to fire inadequate teachers. Specifically, teachers should be reevaluated frequently and should have to reapply for their position periodically. Regular job evaluations are accepted as standard protocol in many other professions, and there is no reason teaching should be an exception.
Rather than merely forcing teachers to expend more hours in the classroom, smart school reform must center on reinforcing and rewarding high-quality and high-impact teaching. In the end, teachers who want to improve will benefit students the most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s attitude towards homosexuality has changed dramatically over the past century.  In 1920, the University, under the leadership of Abbott L. Lowell, Class of 1877, established a secret court to discover and expel homosexuals within the community.  During the 1950s, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid Wilbur J. Bender ’27, tried to improve the admission office’s “ability to detect homosexual tendencies and serious psychiatric problems.” Now, sexual orientation is again becoming a controversial subject for elite college admissions officers. The LGBT interest group Campus Pride has proposed adding an optional question about sexual orientation to the Common Application.  Supporters of this movement believe that such a question will better enable colleges to meet the needs of LBGT prospective applicants and would produce a more sexually diverse classes. However, although it has the best intentions, the current proposition is flawed for several reasons.
First, unlike race, gender, or geographical location, by age 18 some applicants are unsure of their sexual orientation.  College admissions committees seeking a diverse LGBT community would have to deal with the possibility that some applicants may not want, or be ready to, identify their LGBT status.  Research shows that only 0.5 percent of teenage males identify as being homosexual, but averages among adults are higher.  Those teenagers, who will eventually join the LGBT community, will remain unidentified during the admissions process.  Other  LGBT applicants might feel pressured to reveal their sexual identity to their family, friends, and teachers before they are ready.  Coming out in college is very common, especially in accepting atmospheres such as Harvard; individuals who wait until college, despite being valid members of the LGBT community, would go undetected and unrepresented.
A related problem is the semantics of the exact question; would it be in binary form—gay or straight?  What about bisexual and transsexual identities?  The Common Application is unlikely to produce a question that is both inclusive and specific enough to be useful.  How could applicants be expected to squeeze something as personal as their sexuality into a tiny box to be checked?
It is also unclear exactly what a sexually diverse class would look like.  Should admissions offices make the class percentages match the national averages? Studies estimating the percentage of homosexual males in the US population range from 2 percent to 10 percent.  However, it is possible that the percentage of homosexual students at a university, such as Harvard, might be higher.  Recent research suggests that homosexual male college students are, on average, more academically inclined and have higher grade point averages than their heterosexual counterparts.
Finally, it would be naïve to believe that people would not lie about their sexual orientation.  Some individuals are willing to do or say anything to get in to an elite college.  But, unlike race, sexual orientation would be easy to fake, as colleges would have no ethically acceptable ways of checking.
Admittedly, the sentiment behind introducing a question about sexual orientation to the Common Application marks an important shift in the right direction. There is a need for queer students to feel more accepted on college campuses.  Many students come from less-than-accepting backgrounds and unfortunately, homosexuality (and the social pressures it engenders) remain correlated with teenage suicide attempts.
Thus, many elite academic institutions have sought to welcome admitted LGBT applicants through special outreach programs; Harvard sets up “queer friendly” hosts for visiting admitted students who request them, and this year, the University  of Pennsylvania has been vocal about establishing LGBT recruitment projects. These efforts have been welcome and valuable.
Nevertheless, it would be more beneficial for all involved if students were admitted for their merits and more overt perspectives rather than their choice of bedfellow. If an applicant’s sexual orientation is an important part of his identity, nothing stops him, her, zhim or zer from discussing it. But, attempts to balance a class for sexual orientation—as might be done for other measures of diversity—would be misleading.  Indeed, forcing the issue upon applicants, and then using the information to determine the composition of the admitted class would be unfair and ineffective.

A group of Massachusetts researchers has successfully completed the first run of human trials of the latest artificial pancreas design—a development that will free type 1 diabetics from relying on daily insulin injections.
In the design, a blood glucose monitor signals a subcutaneous device to release insulin and glucagon, which are deficient pancreatic hormones in type 1 diabetics.
The technology depends on an automated software that uses a glucose-control algorithm to determine the appropriate amounts of insulin and glucagon a patient needs, according to Edward Damiano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University.
The artificial pancreas differs from typical glucose-control methods for type 1 diabetics by including minute injections of glucagon, Damiano added.
“Most people realize that type 1 diabetics have trouble producing insulin, but what is less commonly known is that they often don’t produce enough glucagon,” said Steven J. Russell, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School who also worked on the project.
Constant glucose-monitoring systems face the problem of a delay between the release of insulin and its absorption in the body. If the body responds too slowly, too much insulin can accumulate and result in hypoglycemia—a worst-case scenario, according to Firas El-Khatib, a researcher at Boston University.
The latest artificial pancreas uses glucagon as extra protection by increasing dangerously low glucose levels when a patient is nearing hypoglycemia.
The researchers discovered in that variability in the rate of insulin-absorption is very high—not only across the general population, but also for specific individuals. The versatility of the algorithm in the artificial pancreas allows the device to treat patients with widely differing insulin absorption rates.
Russell said that the researchers are preparing for the second phase of human trials next month, which will give patients—some as young as 12—a more portable system and require them to eat six meals a day over the course of 51 hours.
In a little more than a year, the researchers say they hope to begin trials with completely wearable devices—and not long after that, trials at home.
“If all goes well, we could have a working system in five years” said Damiano, who hopes to have the system ready before his son—who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as an infant—goes to college.
“We would love to be put out of business by someone who finds a cure for type 1 diabetes,” Russell said. “But until that happens, we’re going to continue to work to help people who are suffering.”

Two teams of undergraduate entrepreneurs were each awarded $15,000 on March 31 to realize their respective commercial and social projects this summer as winners of the largest i3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge grant.
The i3 Innovation Challenge—an annual competition that began three years ago as a partnership between Harvard Student Agencies, the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard, and the Harvard College Entrepreneurship Forum—encourages business ventures across all disciplines, and challenges students to “imagine, invent, and impact,” according to the competition’s Web site.
The Challenge’s sponsors offer grants of differing amounts to the winning teams, finalists, and semi-finalists of each of several categories.
Of these various awards, the McKinley Family Grant for Innovation and Entrepreneurial Leadership in Commercial Enterprise is the largest, with a total $15,000.
A panel of 13 judges chose the two winning projects—a “for-profit commercial venture” called NaviTOUR and a “not-for-profit social venture” called DigiLit—according to the i3 Web site.
Steven N. Maheshwary ’12, Nicholas J. Navarro ’10, Sheng J. Pan ’11, Dana J. Platt ’10, and MIT graduate student Sean Liu created NaviTOUR, a virtual game that enables its users to learn and practice foreign languages.
NaviTour was the brainchild of Maheshwary, who said he was unsatisfied with the speaking component of his Spanish language class at the College. Maheshwary added that he hopes to offer the program free of charge to users in order to provide “all students and language instructors of the world with an equal opportunity to study abroad online.”
Mackenzie Sigalos ’10 also tackled the issue of accessibility in her team’s winning social venture project DigiLit. She said she was inspired by the non-profit organization One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), which aims to provide inexpensive laptops to children throughout the developing world in order to eliminate poverty through education.
Sigalos said that despite OLPC’s initial popularity, it garnered “negative press” because it failed to consider teachers’ potential lack of technological savvy.
To overcome this roadblock, Sigalos said that DigiLit aims to provide accessible curricula and training for both teachers and students.

University Information Systems took down a beta version of Harvard Connections—an online directory billed as “a richer, interactive site including user-generated content”—last Friday, just two days after its launch, due to privacy concerns raised by the Harvard community.
The Web site, which originally allowed internal users to view contact information and Harvard ID photos of University affiliates, was shut down temporarily in order to “incorporate [user] feedback and fix some critical technical bugs,” Kishan Mallur, director of IT infrastructure services, said in a statement.
“Some users objected to their image and other information being included,” Mallur said. “There will be additional communications and discussions before the site goes live again so that people can review their privacy settings.”
University spokesman Kevin Galvin did not clarify the nature of the technical issues or whether Harvard Connections adhered to the same privacy settings that users chose for the existing Harvard University directories.
Mallur added in the statement that the beta version of the site was intended to allow users to familiarize themselves with new features and provide UIS with feedback.
The beta version of Harvard Connections used some form of IP filtering to determine who had access to the directory, meaning that only computers within the Harvard network would have been able to view the information.
Assistant Computer Science professor Stephen N. Chong, who specializes in privacy issues, wrote in an e-mailed statement that protecting user privacy is both a managerial as well as technical challenge.
“The issues with the Harvard Connections Web site emphasize that [user privacy] is a common and pressing problem,” Chong wrote.
Students also stressed the importance of being able to control access to their contact information.
“In general, it is important to me that Harvard protect my contact information,” said Joanna I. Naples-Mitchell ’10. “It is also important that we understand the terms that we are agreeing to from the outset.”

American citizens must work with the federal government to keep America safe in an increasingly technologically complex, globalized world, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said at a Forum at the Institute of Politics last night.
At the event—cosponsored by the Kennedy School’s Women & Public Policy Program, National Security Program, and Women & Gender Caucus—Napolitano focused her remarks on combatting terrorist threats. But the audience, echoing the sentiments of a group of protestors outside, concentrated on immigration issues during the question-and-answer session.
Napolitano, whose name has been floated as a possible nominee to the Supreme Court, said that the federal government is working to share intelligence with international allies to combat foreign terrorism, and with local officials to prevent home-based threats. She also emphasized the importance of staying ahead of the Internet and new technology in modern terrorism.
Napolitano called on American citizens to work with the government to strengthen security.
“We can’t put a glass dome over our country. We can’t guarantee there won’t be another attack,” Napolitano said. “But making a habit out of preparedness, making it a part of our culture, will ultimately draw on the innovation and civic spirit of the American people.”
Audience members asked Napolitano, who served as Arizona’s governor before taking the helm of the Department of Homeland Security, to comment on immigration policies and the recent passage of anti-illegal immigrant legislation in Arizona. When questioned about the federal government’s plans to remedy problems in the enforcement of immigration laws, Napolitano stressed the need for comprehensive immigration reform.
“We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws,” Napolitano said.
Dimple J. Rana, a co-founder of the Massachusetts-based non-profit Deported Diaspora, said she thought Napolitano did not directly answer several questions about problems with current immigration policy and enforcement.
“As the head of the largest enforcement agency in the world, it’s not enough to say that we need reform now.” Rana said. “She has the power of the executive order.”
Rosa M. Robles, a community organizer in San Diego who is at Harvard as part of a week-long program with the National Hispana Leadership Institute, agreed that waiting is not an option.
“We live in fear. I can’t cross the border, and I have family in Mexico,” she said. “I feel like a prisoner in my own backyard.”

According to speakers on a “moral biology” panel yesterday, the union of morality and science calls for a heavy dose of skepticism.
Mixing DNA and Descartes, the panel discussed how developments in evolutionary biology and the mind sciences should be applied to diverse fields such as law, philosophy, and economics.
The panel—which took place at Harvard Law School and was entitled “Moral Biology: How should developments in mind sciences and behavioral biology alter our understanding of law and morality?”—featured four panelists, including Joshua D. Greene, an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard.
The panel’s moderator, I. Glenn Cohen—an assistant professor at Harvard Law School and co-director of the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics—introduced the panelists as a “truly intimating group of people” before each discussed their thoughts on science in relation to morality.
William J. FitzPatrick, a professor of philosophy at Virginia Tech, asked the audience to be skeptical about claims of moral biology.
In response to this, Greene, who studies moral judgment and decision-making, then asked the audience “to be skeptical of his [FitzPatrick’s] skepticism.”
He said that human morality could be looked at in two ways: how it “ought” to be and how it actually “is.”
“There is a bright yellow line between ought and is,” he said. “I think science can have important implications.”
Adina L. Roskies, an assistant professor of philosophy at Dartmouth College, incited more skepticism from the audience, asking the panel’s attendees to be skeptical of Greene’s skepticism of FitzPatrick.
On a different note, Philosophy Professor Thomas M. Scanlon Jr. noted that people have different philosophical beliefs that can influence their thoughts regarding morality.
“What philosophy is about is not about deciding what people think, but deciding what to think yourself,” he said.
The panel was organized as part of the two-day 2010 Conference of Law and Mind Sciences called “Moral Biology?: What Can Biology and the Mind Sciences Teach Us about Law and Morality?”

Everett City Councilman Sal DiDomenico won a special primary for the state senate seat formerly held by Anthony Galluccio this past Tuesday, narrowly beating out second-place finisher Timothy R. Flaherty by roughly 130 votes.
Flaherty has since called for a recount, citing narrow margins and “voting irregularities in Everrett” in a statement posted on his campaign’s Web site.
His campaign declined to comment regarding the voting irregularities to which the statement refers.
Flaherty’s statement was unclear as to whether or not he is calling for a recount in every ward, or just in Everrett.
According to the Brian McNiff, the spokesman for the Massachusetts Secretary of State, no official papers have been filed to start a recount.
Flaherty has until next Monday to petition for a recount, as stipulated by election rules that allow candidates to make this request within six days of an election.
According to the Secretary of State’s Web site, a recount petition requires 10 signatures per ward being recounted, and 50 signatures if the ward is located in Boston.
McNiff said that recounts are not rare, estimating that in an average year there is at least one election in which a candidate requests one.
“It happens more often than you might think,” he said, adding that recounts generally do not change the outcome of the race.
“But every race is different,” McNiff said.
The senate seat was vacated in January when former Senator Gallucio resigned before the end of his term. Galluccio was sentenced to a year in prison in January, after he violated his probation for a hit-and-run accident by failing a series of breathalyzer tests.
Flaherty intends to run again for the senate seat in the regular primary in September, regardless of the results of the recount, according to campaign spokesperson Dory Clark.
“Given that this has been such an incredibly close election, we are not sure of our strategy going forward,” Clark said. “However, right now, it certainly looks like he will be running again.”

A new jewelry boutique called Tesoro will open on Bow Street next week—a sign of the stability of the Harvard Square business community despite the country’s recent financial challenges.
The new store, which will occupy the space adjacent to the original home of Quick Flix, will feature a selection of silver jewelry and accessories from exotic locations like Peru, Brazil, and Venezuela, according to store owner Jorge Luis Montana.
Montana, who has been planning to open the store for the past three years, said he hopes Tesoro will fill a niche in the jewelry market in Harvard Square by offering products “with a twist.”
“There are a lot of jewelry stores, but if I may say so, I don’t think I have found one that really captures my imagination,” said Montana, a native of Peru. “What I’m trying to offer is something very distinct and different from what everyone else has.”
“I’ve been in jewelry for a long, long time, but this is very innovative,” he added.
With prices starting at around $10, Tesoro will offer “a little bit of everything for everyone,” Montana said. In addition to jewelry, Tesoro will carry seasonal offerings such as sarongs as well as beachwear.
“The bathing suits will be from Brazil—not your conservative type of bathing suit,” he said. “Nobody else is going to have anything like them.”
Tesoro’s impending arrival in Harvard Square on April 23 comes in the wake of the March closure of Quick Flix, the area’s last movie rental store.
Though Quick Flix owner Michael Bradley said he was sad to see the store close, he wrote on the company’s Web site that “we all knew this was probably not going to be a sustainable business, but we put up a good fight.”
“Due to the direction of the industry, and growing trends of on demand/streaming we have been left with little choice but to recognize the sunset of our path,” Bradley wrote.
But Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that Quick Flix’s closing is an exception to the larger trend of stability among businesses in the community.
Apart from Quick Flix, the Square has not recently experienced much turnover, and businesses that do close are usually replaced immediately, Jillison said.
“We are nearly 95 percent occupied here in the Square, and this rate has remained steady for the past decade, even during last year’s financially challenging times,” she added. “There are many examples of great retailers and restaurateurs with very successful business models.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College administration is not significantly altering its January Term policy for students living in the Dudley House Cooperative, despite an Undergraduate Council position paper calling for a change.
Members of the Co-op wanting to stay on campus during next year’s J-Term will have to apply like any other undergraduate living in a Harvard dormitory, according to Jeff Neal, a spokesman for the College.
“Undergraduates at Dudley House are part of the College’s residential house system,” Neal wrote in an e-mail. “They are invited to apply, like other students, to remain on campus if they fit one of the categories that Dean [Evelynn] Hammonds outlined.”
Members of the Co-op—which houses 32 students and two tutors living in two three-story houses near Porter Square—had hoped that College administrators would allow all its members to stay in the Co-op for the upcoming J-Term.
Michelle E. Crentsil ’10, Dudley House’s UC representative, worked with other members of the UC to create a J-Term position paper, which included a recommendation to allow the entirety of the Co-op to stay on campus during the period.
The position paper was presented to the administration in February.
During last year’s inaugural J-Term, the approximately two-thirds of Co-op members who were not approved by the College to stay on campus found themselves shut out after the College changed the locks on their two houses.
“We’re not used to being told we can’t go into our own home,” Crentsil said.
While the Co-op is technically a Harvard dormitory, many members say that they view living in Dudley as practically the same as living off campus.
“Most of us here see the Co-op less as a dormitory and more like an actual home,” wrote Martin Eiermann ’10, co-president of the Co-op, in an e-mail.
Crentsil said she doesn’t feel the College is saving any money by prohibiting Co-op residents from staying on campus during J-Term.
“We don’t have any Harvard staff,” said Crentsil of the two Co-op houses, which are student-run, with members sharing cooking and cleaning duties.
According to Eiermann, the “long shut-down” over J-Term creates additional difficulties for many Co-op members.
“We must pass regular health inspections, so shutting down for J-term is a little bit like shutting down the dining halls: lots of cleaning, lots of excess food that will be tossed,” Eiermann wrote.
Students at the Co-op said they have also been upset over the College’s recent decision to close the Dudley Houses to students during the summer.
“There’s a lot of resentment from Co-opers that they can’t live there over the summer—and now that they can’t live there over January,” said Co-op Co-President Megan A. Shutzer ’10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leverett and Pforzheimer House Masters sent e-mails to students yesterday cautioning them against taking unauthorized courses on Harvard’s campus—especially those that charge participants—after someone unaffiliated with the University had been issued a trespass warning for holding a weekly course in the Science Center.
The e-mail stated that the person had recently offered unauthorized arts courses to Harvard students for a fee.
“We live in a busy urban environment, and unfortunately, from time to time, people who are not affiliated with the University want to take advantage of our open community to gain access to our students and the resources we have to offer,” the House Masters wrote in their e-mails.
In early March, some students had received an e-mail advertising a “very popular non-credit screenwriting seminar” called “Screenwriting from the Heart.” According to the e-mail, the seminar was being offered on “a special basis to Harvard students, affiliates, friends and the community.”
Though it was billed as free for undergraduates, the course charged a $50 fee for textbook and handout materials.
Two students who participated in the course identified the instructor as Andrew Arthur, whose resume on his Web site states that he completed graduate work in psychology and counseling at Harvard from 1988 to 2002 and that he has served as both a non-resident film and drama tutor at the University.
A Harvard student enrolled in the course, who wished to remain anonymous as she was still taking the seminar, said that two Harvard University Police Department officers informed her when she came to the Science Center for the class on April 5 that the seminar was not allowed to meet on Harvard property. She said she did not see Arthur that day.
The HUPD log noted that an individual who was not authorized to be in the Science Center received a trespass warning for all Harvard property on April 5 and a subsequent trespass letter the following week.
The student reported that the class of about 10 students met again on April 12 in a building on Brattle Street. According to the student, Arthur said he had been teaching the course for five years and showed the class e-mails proving that he had booked the Science Center room for the course, which first met March 8.
The student added that she does not believe Arthur and the two men who help him run the course are earning a profit from the $50 materials fee.
“Basically, the instructor just personally enjoys teaching a class on screenwriting,” she said.
The student said that she had learned of the class through an e-mail that the Archeology Department’s undergraduate coordinator Elizabeth Rew sent to the concentration list. She added that she was aware the course was not offered through Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some members of the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology have begun the long-awaited exodus out of their laboratories to make room for a centralized space for stem cell researchers.
Through a series of moves that will last until mid-May, MCB faculty members currently stationed in the Sherman Fairchild Biochemistry Building will vacate the premises to join other members of the department in the Biological Laboratories and the Northwest Science Building.
The transition is occurring more than a year after the University announced plans to relocate the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department to Fairchild in response to the slowdown in Allston construction, where a new Science Complex had been heralded as SCRB’s future home.
After MCB leaves the building, Fairchild will be gutted and renovated to prepare for the arrival of the stem cell researchers, who hope to be operational for the fall of 2011, according to Kathryn L. Link, executive director of SCRB.
This past Monday, MCB began its move-out with Associate Professor of Biology Nicole Francis, when she vacated her laboratory in Fairchild and moved down the street to the second floor of the 79-year-old Bio Labs. These laboratories were recently renovated to fit the needs of the incoming MCB professors.
Next week, MCB Professors Sam Kunes and Matthew S. Meselson will follow suit and move into the second and fourth floor of the Bio Labs, respectively, according to MCB Executive Director of Administration Susan H. Foster.
In the following week, Foster said, four other MCB professors will move from their current space in Fairchild Labs  to the Northwest Building, a fairly new structure whose “shell” space has been  converted into functional laboratory spaces for their incoming occupants.
Despite months of planning, the move out of Fairchild Labs has not been without its share of obstacles.
For example, a collection of enzymes were lost during the move this week, which has the potential to slow down research in the lab, according to Foster.
“The folks that moved her freezers put her enzymes in the wrong kind of freezer, and those all had to be replaced,” Foster said.
Such complications, which will be addressed as the other biology professors make the transition into the new facility, “illustrate why it’s difficult to move a lab that’s a working lab,” Foster said. “The interruption in work can be devastating.”
The recent moves come after months of planning and renovating in response to the Feb. 2009 announcement that MCB professors in Fairchild would be uprooted in order to create a unified space for SCRB, whose constituents are scattered across the Harvard campus.
Following the news, many members of the MCB department expressed discontent with the prospect of a drastic transition that often felt like the result of a decision in which they had no input.
“We were absolutely not consulted on this,” said MCB Department Chair Catherine Dulac, who expressed concern that the limited space could hamper growth in the department. “And many people think that that was a poor decision.”
Meselson, whose laboratory has been stationed in Fairchild Labs for nearly 30 years, was instrumental in securing finances and construction plans for the building during his tenure as MCB department chair in the late 1970s.
“It’s going to be much less space and much more difficult,” Meselson said in January, when preparations for the transition were underway.
But Foster expressed relief that MCB is nearly complete with a year-long process that has generated unease and distress across the department.
“MCB is going to have a big celebration and take a deep breath and relax,” Foster said.
Since the decision to vacate Fairchild was made last year, MCB members said that they have been coordinating with architects and physical resources officials from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences about the design of the new spaces.
Faculty members were consulted on the location of their new laboratories and chose the dates for their transfer so as to minimize interferences with their research.
“That was a long process,” Foster said.
“The page has turned at this point,” Dulac said. “We had our grief last year. We overcame it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To increase the appeal of the already popular Computer Science 50, Harvard’s introduction to computer science, course instructor David J. Malan ’99 announced yesterday that starting next fall, some students will be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.
Students who wish to satisfy General Education requirements with the course—9 percent of last semester’s class—will be able to receive letter grades per General Education policy. CS50 will continue to be offered with letter-graded status for departments that expect the course as a letter-graded concentration requirement or for students who prefer to receive a letter grade, according to Malan.
Malan, who first started teaching CS50 in the fall of 2007, said that he had long considered eliminating letter grades to encourage more students without previous programming experience to take the course.
Given the course’s reputation for time-consuming problem sets, Malan said he often worries that interested students may shy away from taking the course, though 72 percent of students who took CS50 last semester said they had no programming experience.
“Some students, myself once included, absolutely hesitate to turn the page to some chapter unfamiliar to them out of fear of ‘failure’ or some dark mark on their transcript,” Malan wrote in an e-mail. “With this change to sat/unsat, CS50 hopes to free students to explore a world beyond their own comfort zone.”
Citing the success of similar grading systems at Harvard Law School and at MIT—where freshmen do not receive letter grades their first semester—Malan said that CS50 students would be able to focus more on the material rather than the grade itself.
“By nature of letter grades, we end up drawing lines (between A and A-, A- and B+, B+ and B, et al.) between values that sometimes differ by .02 percent, and the world proceeds to give those lines far too much weight,” Malan wrote in an e-mail to the CS50 teaching staff sent yesterday.
Head teaching fellow Ayse Cansu Aydede ’11 added that she believed this change will allow students to respond better to the qualitative feedback they receive, as they will not be distracted with points lost in problem sets and quizzes.
Some students expressed concerns about the change in grading policy, arguing that the amount of effort put towards the course would not be accurately reflected in the satisfactory grade.
“If I’m going to put all that effort, I want the grade to sit on my transcript,” Mariana H. Anton ’10 said. “I don’t want a satisfactory—if I put in the work for an A.”
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:
CORRECTION: April 16, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 16 news article "Malan Plans to Cut Letter Grades for CS50" incorrectly stated that starting next fall, all students will be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis in Computer Science 50. In fact, some students will be allowed to take the course for a letter grade.
CLARIFICATION: April 16, 2010
The article also stated that students who wish to satisfy General Education requirements with the course will be able to receive letter grades per General Education policy. To clarify, in addition, CS50 will continue to be offered with letter-graded status for departments that expect the course as a letter-graded concentration requirement or for students who prefer to receive a letter grade, according to course instructor David J. Malan ’99.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MIT Professor Noam Chomsky and other panelists at last night’s Haiti Recovery Caucus identified external forces as contributing to the systemic poverty of the country, which they said has exacerbated the disaster caused by the January earthquake.
Chomsky identified the United States and France as the “two traditional torturers of Haiti” and criticized the invasions of Haiti by US and French forces in its early history, in addition to the neoliberal policies of privatization that the US has promoted—sometimes “by gunpoint”—and its support of coups in its modern history.
Alix Cantave, a lecturer at Tufts University, expanded upon Chomsky’s analysis, adding that the net effect of US and French policies during the aftermath has led to the “over-concentration” of citizens in Port-au-Prince, Haiti’s capital, and has rendered the city more susceptible to natural disasters.
Joia Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and chief medical director of the nongovernmental organization Partners In Health, pointed to American policy promoting the movement of people from rural to urban areas in Haiti as a cause of urban “over-concentration.”
Mukherjee added that Haiti’s poverty is a deliberate attempt of the US and other nations to “purposefully bankrupt” the country and promote neoliberal policies. The effect, she said, was a weak Haitian state incapable of providing health, education, or other social services to its citizens.
The second half of the panel focused on methods to solve the crisis.
Chomsky advocated for reparations to be paid to Haiti from the US for what he called its prolonged exploitation of the nation. He added that the aid given to Haiti should not go to wealthy and powerful citizens or to NGOs, but rather to “state and popular organizations” that can provide infrastructure.
Chomsky also said that aid sent by the US in the wake of the earthquake included “unneeded security” by troops instead of urgently needed food and medicine.
Cantave focused on a “new paradigm” to view Haitian solutions, and recommended utilizing a large cross-section of the Haitian population in recovery efforts.
To ensure the voices of Haitians are heard during the process of recovery, Mukherjee said she advocated empowering pro-democracy movements and working at the local level.
“I hope that the Haiti Recovery Caucus will continue and the ideas of the organization will connect to public policy,” Melissa J. Barber ‘13 said.

Diana Sorensen, divisional dean of the arts and humanities in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will resume her administrative duties in 2011 after a year-long sabbatical, marking a reversal in her initial decision to vacate the post.
Professor of African American Music Ingrid T. Monson will serve as interim dean before Sorensen returns in the fall of 2011 to assume the post for two more years, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in a letter to the Faculty.
In order to maintain the “momentum” created by Sorensen, whose tenure as dean has been marked by initiatives across the humanities, Smith said he asked her to “stay on” as dean.
“After consulting widely with the community, it became clear that Diana’s continued leadership was critical to the success of these innovative but fragile new changes,” Smith wrote.
Sorensen’s agreement to reassume the post comes as a surprise, given that she had announced earlier this year that she would return only to her teaching duties after her sabbatical.
Monson will be returning from a year-long sabbatical of her own to take up her role as interim dean of the division. She said she was contacted by Smith about the appointment a week ago, adding that she plans “to continue the direction Dean Sorensen has so effectively set forth.”
Since last fall, Monson has been at Stanford to work on a book about Neba Solo, a musician based in West Africa.
“He’s like a rock star in Mali,” said Monson, who has focused much of her work on jazz music.
Monson, who has been at Harvard since 2001 and served as the chair of the music department for three years, said that she may be able to incorporate the whimsical nature of jazz into her administrative role—“in the sense of life as one big improvisation.”
“She’s articulate, she’s thoughtful, and she’s accustomed to boundary crossing,” said Music Professor Kay K. Shelemay, who has worked with Monson for more than 25 years.
“It’s wonderful to hear that Dean Sorensen will come back after her leave,” Shelemay said. “And Ingrid Monson is really a terrific individual to hold down the fort.”
In the midst of FAS’ fiscal constraints, Sorensen pushed forward faculty searches and interdepartmental programs across the humanities, garnering the respect of her colleagues.
Sorensen, who has been at Harvard since 2001, is a scholar of Latin American literature and culture, and she plans to work on a book during her sabbatical. She could not be reached for comment.

The Harvard softball team (15-18, 6-2 Ivy) battled hard but ended up dropping both games of a doubleheader to local rival Boston College (12-22, 0-10 ACC) yesterday, losing the first game, 5-4, and the second, 6-4, after a late rally in the bottom of the seventh fell short.
“We came out strong,” captain Margaux Black said of the failed comeback attempt. “We had some great at bats, did a lot of good things, we just had a little bit of a tough day today. A game like this is humbling, and reminds us that you have to battle each and every game.”
BOSTON COLLEGE 6, HARVARD 4
The Eagles came out swinging in the late afternoon, scoring two runs in the first inning on costly errors by the Crimson.
The opening blow was set up when an error by Harvard rookie second baseman Kassy Shiotani allowed a runner on second to take third and the batter to reach first.
An errant throw on the next play allowed the runner on third to score, while advancing the runner on first—who then scored on a double, putting Boston College up 2-0.
Harvard was unable to respond until the bottom of the second, when sophomore Whitney Shaw reached second off an error by the Eagles centerfielder.
Senior Jennifer Francis whacked a double, which advanced Shaw to third. Senior Jessica Pledger kept the scoring chances alive with a single to load the bases, and an error by the BC third baseman sent Shaw home.
Junior Emily Henderson came up to the plate and reached base on a fielder’s choice, allowing Francis to score and tying things up at two runs apiece going into the third.
“Second game, I thought we came out a lot better,” Shaw said. “First off, we scored and responded to their runs. We came back and kept scoring on them, kept the pressure on.”
But Boston College responded, capitalizing on a triple, followed by a single to pull away again in the top of the third.
The run marked the first of four unanswered runs for the Eagles, a spurt lasting through the top of the fourth inning.
Harvard responded by taking advantage of a shortstop error to send Henderson to second, and a single to left field by junior Ellen Macadam sent Henderson home, pulling the Crimson within three runs of the Eagles heading into the fifth.
Sophomore Mari Zumbro relieved classmate Julia Moore in the top of the fifth, and she allowed only two hits and no runs for the rest of the game.
“Mari came in and hasn’t thrown a lot of innings for us and did a great job,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.
After scoring three runs in the first four innings, the Crimson bats went silent, not scoring until the bottom of the seventh inning.
“I think we did well coming out and coming out strong, but we didn’t keep that throughout seven innings,” Shaw said. “We did lull there in the middle, but in the end we definitely picked it up. We had a good rally in the last few innings, which made up for a quiet middle.”
Shaw hit an RBI double to left field, sending senior Stephanie Krysiak home. But it was too little, too late, as Francis lined out to center field, ending the game.
BOSTON COLLEGE 5, HARVARD 4
Both teams were held scoreless through the top of the fifth inning in the opening game, as Harvard’s sophomore hurler Rachel Brown extended her innings-without-an-earned-run streak to 31-straight.
The scoring drought ended during the bottom half of the inning when Shaw smacked a three-run home run well over the center-field fence.
Freshman Jess Ferri next came to the plate and blasted a homer of her own, putting the Crimson ahead, 4-0, going into the sixth inning.
Black served as relief pitcher going into the sixth, and the veteran struggled to get into a rhythm at the start, allowing three hits and five runs—giving Boston College the lead for good.
“We got an awesome start,” Black said. “Two home runs—huge—we had some great at-bats. Unfortunately, I came in the game and struggled a little bit mentally, and ended up letting them score and get ahead of us. We had a couple of mental errors—we just got a little bit in our own way that game, which is unfortunate. I hate that we lost that game, because we did some really good things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When you first meet sophomore Marcus Way, you can’t help but notice his calm and quiet demeanor, but when he steps up to the plate, he’s anything but silent with the bat. Way can hang with the best of them when it comes to knocking the hide off the ball and sending it over the fence.
Not only has he proven that he’s an asset to the Crimson baseball team, but Way has also made remarkable improvements in his second year on the team. Currently, the sophomore has a .306 batting average—third highest on the team—and three home runs and 13 RBI on the season. It is not surprising, then, that he has stepped into the role as the designated hitter on the team and has gained a spot as a starter.
“He’s always been a guy we know will have a big impact on the lineup,” junior captain Tyler Albright remarked. “Every time he steps up to the plate, he hits the crap out of the ball and scores runs for us.”
But Way was not always hitting balls out of the park. He got his start in baseball at the age of two, learning from his father, Phil. While Marcus could barely walk and talk, he was already holding a baseball bat in his hands.
One aspect of Way’s game that stands out is his ability to bat left-handed and throw right-handed, a decision made by his father that has proven to be successful in his baseball career.
“Marcus has always been interested in sports,” Phil remembered. “When he was two years old, I stuck a bat in his hands and told him to bat left-handed. Left-handers have all the advantages in baseball because most of the pitchers are right-handed.”
Even though Way does not remember this specific moment in his childhood, he does look back on the time he spent playing baseball with his dad with fondness.
“I’ve been playing baseball for as long as I can remember,” Way said. “I remember playing in the yard with my dad when I was a kid and it was a lot of fun.”
Way continued to play tee ball when he was little and baseball as he became older. As the youngster's skills developed, he turned his sights on playing college ball.
“In New York [Way’s home state], we have this thing called ‘Mini Olympics,’ and I was on the baseball team for the region,” Way said. “I got a letter to go to Harvard’s baseball camp, and I went the summer after my sophomore and junior years in high school, so the coaches knew who I was.”
At the time, baseball was his passion, and going to Harvard to play at the Division I level was his dream. Although Way was not recruited by the Crimson baseball team, the Naples, N.Y. native refused to let his ambition go and walked onto the squad—proving himself in the process.
“When I first saw Marcus, I noticed his athleticism,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh commented. “He’s certainly got good bat speed, which is what separates him from other people. We had a scout day and their first remarks were about his swing and his bat speed.”
Way realized he had achieved one of his lifelong dreams the first time he entered the batter’s box.
“It was pretty cool stepping up to bat for the Crimson the first time,” Way said. “I struck out, so it was a little disappointing, but I was excited to get my first college at-bat, because it’s what I was working towards for a long time.”
Despite having only 25 at-bats last season and a .200 batting average, Way has made great strides in the offseason and has come to lead by example, slugging at a .494 clip and reaching safely often with a team-leading on-base percentage of .427.
“I think I was able to gain more confidence over the summer,” Way said. “I didn’t get a lot of at-bats last year, and it’s hard when you’re not getting in there, but I got to face a college pitcher this summer, which definitely helped my confidence.”
“He’s become more relaxed and more comfortable on the field,” Albright added. “He just needed that extra experience to get comfortable with himself and improve.”
Off the field, Way is involved in community service, a stark contrast for a player who can be seen mashing pitches at the plate. He helps with a PBHA program called Keylatch, an afterschool organization that helps students in grades K-5 in Boston’s South End with their homework. Way notes that “it’s been a rewarding experience when I’ve been able to go.”
Looking toward the future, Way hopes to either continue with the hard work he has been putting into baseball or to move toward another passion of his: medical school.
“If I had the chance to keep playing baseball, I think I would have to give it a shot,” Way said. “I’ve always found neurobiology to be interesting, so if it wasn’t baseball, it would definitely be medical school.”
“[Way’s] got a quiet demeanor, but his work ethic speaks volumes,” Walsh said. “He’s one of the guys that sticks around after practice, is always in the cages, and works hard. He’s such a quality kid, and I’m proud to have him on the baseball team.”
No matter what his pursuits, Way’s hard work and dedication will ensure that whatever opportunity faces him, he will hit it out of the park.

When freshman James O’Connor is not too busy celebrating diversity, the arts, and fashion with Eleganza 2010, he rows for the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew team.
When his older brother, sophomore Sam O’Connor, is not too busy rowing for Harvard, he is making fun of his little brother.
“Sam thinks it’s kind of funny,” said James about his participation in Eleganza. “I have a pretty minor, average role, but it’s going to be a great show.”
All jokes aside, the two New Zealand natives are an essential part of Harvard’s heavyweight crew program. Having raced at the highest international level even before jumping into a Harvard shell, they are anything but inexperienced underclassmen.
“Both brothers are very good rowers,” said senior captain Blake Pucsek. “Both won [junior] world championships before, and they both have the potential to be on the top boat.”
Born and raised in New Zealand, both James and Sam excelled in athletics throughout high school. They tried their hands at a variety of sports but were natural standouts in one above the rest—rowing.
“We both played rugby, and I played basketball and ran track,” James said, “but towards the end of high school, rowing took over once I made the national team.”
“I thought I was a lot better at rowing than I was at rugby,” Sam added, “and I thought I would carry that on to see how well I would do.”
The brothers explained that rowing runs deep in the O’Connor family, stemming from their father and taking root in all their lives.
“[Dad] gave [Sam] little mini rowing shirts when he was a newborn baby,” James said. “We always used to have holidays, going to training camp and rowing together. We always assumed that we were going to row because it was a part of our lives. Rowing was just kind of there.”
Even their two sisters and their mother have experienced rowing firsthand.
“[Mum] gave in about a year or two ago,” James said. “She started rowing with some of the other mothers at our school. Now she’s really into it socially.”
Rowing was a constant in their lives from the start, but the brothers attributed their choice to continue crew in college to their experiences at the world junior championships. Even their decision to come to Harvard was influenced by Coach Harry Parker’s legacy of strong crews.
Nevertheless, moving to the United States was a daunting task, and Sam attributed the relative ease of transition to his supportive teammates.
“It’s not so bad,” said Sam about moving to the U.S.  “On the crew team we have a lot of guys from England, Australia, and Canada. It definitely helps getting adjusted.”
Sam arrived at Harvard first, and during that year he helped the freshman eight to an undefeated dual racing record, as well as a silver medal at Sprints and the IRA National Championships. His diligence earned him the respect of his teammates and coaches.
“[Sam] is always very focused,” said fellow sophomore teammate Michael DiSanto. “He has a very high standard with everything he does. We joke around, we call him the moral compass, because he always knows what’s right. He looks at everything objectively, and does not let his emotions get the better of him. He always gives guys the benefit of the doubt. He’s just a great, great guy. Everyone respects and looks up to him.”
Perhaps the only thing Sam places above rowing is family.  He keeps in close touch with his parents in New Zealand—despite the 16 hour time difference—and when James arrived, Sam helped him get settled into college life.
“Sam’s a great older brother,” DiSanto said. “[He] always looks out for [James], making sure he stays on top of his work academically and making sure he gets his stuff done athletically as well.”
“Sam took me out in a small boat [when I first got here],” James added. “[He] showed me the river…the scene.”
Indeed, on the Charles is where they spend most of the year, always training for the next race. Their recent loss to Brown only further motivated them to polish and perfect their trade.
“You’ve got to train harder than you race,” James said. “You know that all the other colleges are full of guys working to beat Harvard.”
When asked which is the better oarsmen, both brothers were humble about their skills.
“Sam always set the standard I had to chase,” James said.
“James is better for his age than I was,” Sam replied. “We’re just helping each other get better and better.”

In a series of incidents, it appears that the "serial caller" who plagued Hollis residents last year is at it again. But this time around, he's calling all over campus and has been dubbed the “phone whisperer.”
Mather resident Emma W. Wood '12 received a call at 7 a.m. on Monday morning.
"I talked to him for like, one minute. I thought that it might be my boyfriend," Wood said. "He whispered 'I can't sleep. Can we just talk for a while?' Then I realized that it wasn't my boyfriend, so I asked who it was. He whispered, 'It's me. Who else would call you this early?' Then I just hung up."
Leverett resident Kaoru Takasaki '10, an inactive Crimson editor, received a similar call on Sunday also at 7 a.m.
"Some guy whispered 'Hello? Are you awake?' to me, and I was half-asleep and got kind of freaked out so I hung up on him," she said. "He called again, and—in my half-asleep state—I couldn't get the phone to stop ringing, so I ended up unplugging the phone."
This is definitely not the first time that the mysterious "whisperer" has plagued the campus with his eerie calls. According to the same article linked above, Harvard University Police Department identified a man in south Florida as the original “serial whisperer” in 2001. Similar calls were reported in 2003. But police could not take action because making phone calls was not illegal.
In fact, this recent caller seems to resemble the one who called female Hollis residents in the fall of 2008. At that time, this "phone whisperer" made early-morning calls to tell students he was "crazy about you."
Mather House administrators declined to comment on the incidents.

Yardfest is almost here—count down with us! Check out our primer to Kid  Cudi and Parick Park, then watch for more Yardfest features to come. Today, we give  you a guide to Wale.
This prolific Nigerian-American hip-hop  artist is a D.C. native who has produced five mixtapes and one album  to date titled,  “Attention  Deficit,” which The   Crimson has reviewed before.
Wale is also known for his collaboration with popular  artists like Pharrell for the song “Inhibitions,” Gucci Mane for the song “Pretty Girls,” and Lady Gaga for his hit song, “Chillin.”
Wale, whose real name is Olubowale  Folarin,  is also not afraid to innovate with his music. His eclectic “W.A.L.E.D.A.N.C.E” mixes hip-hop with the French techno duo  Justice’s “D.A.N.C.E” to create an entirely new song.
The 25-year-old will be performing after Patrick Park and  before Kid  Cudi. Listen to Wale’s mixtapes and albums  in preparation for Yardfest—when he comes, you’ll be rapping like  the best of them.

Yardfest is almost here—count down with us! Check out our guides to Kid Cudi, Parick Park, and Wale, then watch for more Yardfest features to come. Tonight, we give you a roundup of Yardfest equivalents at other Ivies.
Today, April 16, the first of the Ivy League spring weekend events begins. Down in Philadelphia, Penn’s Spring Fling will feature performances by Snoop Dogg, Kid Cudi, and Shwayze at Franklin Field. According to The Daily Pennsylvanian, some teachers have even moved assignments due today until Monday, just so their students can go partake in the fun. Harvard professors: we can haz the same for Yardfest?
Next weekend, on April 24, students at Columbia will celebrate Bacchanal, their annual spring concert. Three star performers—Ghostface Killah, glam rockers of Montreal, and Wiz Khalifa—will team up on the campus’s Low Plaza in Morningside Heights to kick off the party. According to The Columbia Spectator, budget restrictions have not hampered plans for fun: this year, three artists are somehow performing instead of the usual two. Also, the event is slated for an evening start instead of its usual afternoon beginning.
Yale’s Spring Fling, to be held April 27, will feature a lineup of performers that includes Mike Posner, Matt & Kim, the Ying Yang Twins, and MGMT. For an April Fool’s joke, IvyGate reported April 1 that MGMT cancelled the Yale concert because of “misogynistic artists” like SnoopDog and the Yin Yang Twins...but, as far as we can tell, the Brooklyn-based rock duo is still on its way to New Haven.  According to The Yale Daily News, MGMT had been the planning committee’s first choice since they started planning in the fall.
MGMT will also be performing at Brown’s Spring Weekend, the annual celebration of the nearly completed academic year. This year’s festivities—to be held April 23-25—mark the 50th anniversary of Spring Weekend.  Other performers include Snoop Dogg, Major Lazer, the Black Keys, and Wale.
On May 7, Cornell will hold its annual Slope Day, originally conceived in 1901 as a celebration of warm weather and the end of the academic year. While the event has in the past included activities like mock bullfighting and circuses, this year, Slope Day will feature the R&B artist Drake and additional performances from musicians like synth pop band Francis & The Lights and Canadian rapper k-os.
At Dartmouth, another “Green Key Weekend” looms. The usual plan of attack for the three-day weekend includes a block party at Phi Delta Alpha fraternity and a lawn party at Alpha Delta. There used to be chariot races (just like in Ben-Hur!), but those were banned in the mid-1980s.
