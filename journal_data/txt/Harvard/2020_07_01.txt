After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike most, this pandemic is not my first experience with social isolation. During my first year of high school, my life was upended by a chronic illness. Increasingly, I became unable to attend classes, bedridden, and soon had to drop out altogether. With scant warning, my active lifestyle was put on hold — no longer could I go rock climbing, play tennis, practice cello and piano, travel, or do any of the social activities I once enjoyed. It would be two years before my health showed any significant improvements. Two years in my own socially distant quarantine. However, those years belied expectations; they proved to be filled with new friendships, communities, and, yes, a fulfilling educational experience entirely online.
At first, it seemed my whole world was swept from under me — but in time, I found a new community. I became a regular on a Minecraft server with a player base of around a hundred people from around the world. I developed dozens of friendships through this server. From a Canadian girl and fellow former high schooler to a Dutch electrical engineer. More than just building individual friendships, though, I connected with a community: a group of digital denizens tied together by the mutual goal of having fun. It had a warmth and familiarity similar to any in-person community I had been a part of.
For education, I had free rein to explore what I desired — which was math. I started in the standard way, taking some online classes. Those went alright. However, my online education transformed with my discovery of MIT OpenCourseWare. MIT OCW’s course materials were free and not behind registration or forced guiding apparatus. If I wanted to look at lecture 12 or problem set four immediately, I could.
With MIT OCW’s flexibility, I could study my own way. Instead of going course by course, I would go curiosity by curiosity. I also found an online community of amateur mathematicians. I would raise new concepts and problems online and there was always someone, or usually a few people, around to discuss with. Others would do the same, and I would learn what they were doing. The members had a wide range of expertise and interests. In a day, I would ask questions of experts in a topic I was struggling with and then teach those topics to those less expert than I. This added up to a learning experience with the freedom and interactivity hard to find in-person.
Succinctly capturing how meaningful these online communities were for me is difficult. I can remember late night chats about deeply personal topics with people whose faces I had never seen. I remember forming a game development team and starting a very unnecessary podcast with my Dutch friend. I remember Minecraft Christmas, decorations, presents, and all. I remember hosting evening math chats where half my European friends would join to listen to something while they went to sleep (it wasn’t the math — apparently I have a soothing “classic American” accent). People made joint art projects and songs for this online world. Four years after the Minecraft server shutdown, the community still holds weekly game nights. These examples comprise a minuscule fraction of the experience I had online.
So, what should we learn from this?
To my peers, you are not alone. Even when I was the only one in lockdown, I was not alone. Just like I managed to socialize in my time of isolation, so can you. However, you need to be flexible and learn to socialize in new ways. You can find and build communities and new experiences online. Approach online experiences with an open mind and reject the dogmatic insistence that online interaction is inferior. Virtual learning isn’t diminished learning, it’s a different, equally valid form of education. Meaningful online connections are not only possible but can be found in abundance.
To institutions, I ask you to share your resources. Harvard, the wealthiest university in the world, can share more of its expertise and course materials with the world as colleges outside its gates are struggling to survive. When I was isolated, MIT OCW enabled my education. With the world in isolation, it is high time Harvard followed suit.
To everyone, the time to affect change is now. My illness destroyed my world, but what followed was a reconstruction that yielded a new world unrecognizable from what came before. This pandemic destroyed our world and its reconstruction is happening now. We need to put conscious thought into what this change will be.
To start, the conversation around online education must change. So far, our discourse has focused on details of moving back to campus while treating online education as an afterthought and last resort. But this pandemic is a disruption to education that we may not see again for another lifetime. As we rebuild our education system to suit an online world, we also have the unique opportunity to reimagine it. We can continue to dismiss online education outright, or we can take this moment to proactively rethink pedagogy in the light of new technology. The new education paradigm is coming either way. Let's build it right.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After nearly two years of negotiations and more than five years of union organizing, members of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers voted to ratify the union’s first contract with the University Tuesday.
The contract — which will go into effect for one year on July 1 — was put up to a ratification vote after Harvard and the union reached a tentative agreement on June 16. Nearly 97 percent of student workers voted to approve the contract, the first in University history to provide more than 4,000 student workers at Harvard with workplace protections.
The newly minted agreement provides 2.8 percent raises, new health care and child care funds, and provisions to protect student workers from harassment and discrimination, among other benefits.
Rachel J. Sandalow-Ash ’15, a member of HGSU-UAW’s bargaining committee, said in a press release that the contract’s ratification will usher in necessary protections for students amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
“Student-workers at Harvard make this university run by teaching courses and conducting cutting-edge research,” Sandalow-Ash said. “It is about time that we have a union contract that ensures we can do that work in a safe environment.”
The one-year contract also guarantees union members paid bereavement and sick days, along with provisions protecting workers’ positions when they take extended unpaid leaves for medical emergencies.
HGSU-UAW members are already gearing up to bargain once again, according to an emailed statement sent out to union members. The University proposed shortening the original multi-year contract to a one-year agreement in early May, citing future economic uncertainty the University faces in light of the pandemic.
Among other provisions, the union’s bargaining team will lobby the University for stronger protections against discrimination and harassment in its next contract — a key point of contention between the University and the union over the past two years, and one of the three proposals that led HGSU-UAW to call a four-week strike in December 2019.
In a statement declaring these demands, some rank-and-file members vowed to continue organizing if Harvard does not respond to their concerns.
“If the administration doesn’t agree to addressing our core concerns in our next contract, we commit to organizing for a strike to win these rights and benefits through collective action,” the statement read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Kennedy School study released this month suggests a direct link between police violence and diminished academic performance of inner-city students.
HKS public policy professor Desmond W. Ang analyzed data from more than 600 police killings and more than 700,000 high school students in a large, urban county, and noticed significant drop offs in students’ educational outcomes and mental health following the killings.
Ang published his findings in the June issue of the HKS Faculty Research Working Paper Series.
Ang found that students who live near a police killing are more likely to miss school the following day. The study also showed these students experience drops in their GPAs over multiple semesters and are 15 percent more likely to experience emotional disturbance, a learning disability associated with depression and PTSD.
Each killing affected more than 300 students on average. Students were twice as likely to report feeling unsafe in their neighborhoods the year after a killing, according to the study.
Ang also identified a strong racial disparity in student outcomes: The harmful educational effects of police killings were “entirely” levied against Black and Hispanic students, while white and Asian students remained largely unaffected, the study found. Black and Hispanic students were found to be especially affected when a police shooting involved an unarmed minority.
Ang wrote in the report that his findings suggest each police killing causes three students of color to drop out of high school on average — nearly 2,000 students in his dataset dropped out. Though Ang only analyzed high school data, he said in an interview that there could be additional effects on younger children.
Ang added that killings comprise just a “really tiny fraction” of police violence, and that researchers “don’t have a strong sense” of the specific effects of beatings, tazings, and non-lethal shootings on students and their neighborhoods.
He also said one of the main challenges when presenting his research is different people’s perceptions of policing.
“A lot of people's conception of police is just so different from what it is in minority or urban neighborhoods,” he said. “And I think that's the challenge, getting people to understand that policing just looks completely different in certain neighborhoods and people's views of police are really different between different neighborhoods.”
Ang said he hopes people will begin to understand that police brutality and violence has larger social ramifications for “the whole community.”
Amid nationwide anti-racism protests in the wake of murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by Minneapolis police, Ang also said he is hopeful recent events will engender “a growing recognition” of the importance of topics like police brutality in the social sciences.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared to refer to prominent Black Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. as “some criminal” in an interview published by the New York Times Tuesday.
The remark apparently referred to a 2009 incident in which a Cambridge Police officer wrongfully arrested Gates for disorderly conduct as he attempted to enter his own home. The arrest prompted widespread criticism of CPD for racial profiling, leading then-President Barack Obama to invite Gates and the arresting officer, Sgt. James Crowley, to the White House for a “beer summit.”
Sessions — who faces a tight primary contest July 14 in his bid to return to the U.S. Senate — made the remark while comparing his position on law enforcement as Attorney General with policing reforms undertaken by Obama’s Justice Department. Sessions described his philosophy on policing to the Times as “back to the men and women in blue.”
“The police had been demoralized. There was all the Obama — there’s a riot, and he has a beer at the White House with some criminal, to listen to him. Wasn’t having a beer with the police officers. So we said, ‘We’re on your side. We’ve got your back, you got our thanks,’” Sessions said, inaccurately stating that the officer was not invited to the meeting.
The Times attempted to clarify whether Sessions was referring to the beer summit with Gates, but a Sessions spokesperson “declined to elaborate.”
Gates and a Sessions spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment from The Crimson Tuesday evening.
Gates — who holds one of Harvard’s few prestigious University Professorships — directs the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. He was awarded a MacArthur Foundation "Genius Grant" in 1981, was named one of Time magazine's "25 Most Influential Americans" in 1997, has created fifteen documentaries based on his scholarship, and currently hosts the show “Finding Your Roots” on PBS.
Sessions’ remark comes during a time of national reckoning over police brutality and anti-Black racism following the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police.
Gates’ wrongful arrest likewise sparked a nationwide conversation on racial profiling by the police at the time.
In July 2009, a woman called the Cambridge police when she saw Gates and his driver trying to force open Gates’ jammed front door after returning from a trip. The officer, Crowley, arrested Gates for disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped the next week, and the district attorney’s office and the City of Cambridge released a joint statement with Gates calling the incident “regrettable and unfortunate.”
A report by the Cambridge Review Committee in June 2010 concluded race was a minor factor in the incident; instead, it blamed the arrest on missed opportunities by both Gates and officers to de-escalate the situation.
Obama commented at the time that Cambridge Police “acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home,” though he and Gates both later softened their remarks.
Gates and Crowley have met cordially multiple times since the incident — including at the White House — and Gates told New York Times Magazine this February that he does not believe Crowley is racist.
Clarification: July 1, 2020
A previous version of this article stated that a Cambridge police officer wrongfully arrested Harvard professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr. as he attempted to enter his own home. To clarify, the charrged — which was later dropped — was for disorderly conduct.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard released a set of considerations Tuesday for how philanthropic gifts are “considered, accepted, and administered within Harvard” in a first-of-its-kind gift policy guide.
The guide's central priorities include “upholding academic freedom” and “adhering to institutional values,” which Harvard defines as “respecting the rights, differences, and dignity of individuals,” “demonstrating honesty and fair play in all dealings,” and “pursuing excellence at all times.”
It also listed “avoiding conflicts of interest” that might undermine educational and research activities and “ensuring alignment and autonomy” between Harvard and donors as top priorities.
The University’s report on its ties to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein, released in early May, recommended Harvard develop clearer procedures on potentially controversial gifts.
“We recommend that the Gift Policy Committee be formally tasked with developing a set of written expectations that will expand the universe of gifts and donors who should be evaluated,” the report that accompanied the findings of the Epstein investigation read.
The Epstein report also suggested the creation of “triggering criteria” — such as the gift’s size, a donor’s lack of connection to Harvard, or “known concerns” regarding a potential donor’s actions — to bring certain gifts to the attention of the gift policy committee.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that the decision to write the gift policy guide was prompted by “time of social change, with more calls for transparency and explanation in areas that did not come under close scrutiny before.”
“We wanted to share this guide to be accountable for and explicit about the principles that the University draws upon when it considers and accepts gifts,” Garber said.
The guide covers solicitation and acceptance of gifts, recognition of donors, management of funds, and the role of the Gift Policy Committee.
Vice President of Alumni Affairs and Development Brian K. Lee told the Gazette that the guide shares what Harvard “will and will not accept.” He also said the University will not solicit gifts from donors with family members vying for a place at Harvard.
“For example, gifts will not be solicited from donors and prospective donors who are known to have a family member applying for admission to Harvard,” Lee told the Gazette. “Similarly, if those same individuals were to offer an unsolicited gift, they would be advised that no gifts to the University should be made at that time.”
Documents and testimony from the lawsuit brought against Harvard by Students for Fair Admissions, though, revealed that familial financial contributions appear to boost individual applicants’ chances of admission.
The guide also grapples with naming and renaming funds, scholarships, physical spaces, collections, faculty positions, and other “vehicles” for donor recognition.
It notes “certain types of naming recognition” — including corporate recognition in residential spaces and the names of governments, sitting heads of state, and current Harvard faculty and staff — are prohibited.
The guide also states that the University “may choose to revoke naming recognition when the gift commitment supporting the naming has not been fulfilled, or where the donor’s actions are so outside the bounds of acceptable conduct, as judged by reference to prevailing societal norms, that continued use of the name is damaging to the interests of the University.”
The guide adds, however, that “prevailing societal norms ordinarily will be assessed at the time of the gift, not later.”
Harvard affiliates and activists have previously called on the University to remove or change the names of Harvard’s houses, museums, and academic buildings tied to former slave owners, racist historical figures, and various controversial individuals.
Still, the guide is not definitive, and Garber said that its “specific applications and interpretation may vary over time” since it is “intended to be a living document.”
He said the guide is not a set of rules that will exist independently from the Gift Policy Committee. Rather, he told the Gazette that it is intended to be “a companion to a process, one that is consultative and always capable of review and improvement.”

The Harvard Library began providing in-person book pickup and resumed scan and deliver services Tuesday as part of its first phase of reopening, librarians Anna C. Assogba and Fred Burchsted wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Tuesday.
More than three months ago, the novel coronavirus pandemic forced the University to shutter most of its on-campus teaching and research facilities – including its library system, the largest private library system and the largest academic library in the world. Now, the Library is beginning its gradual reopening, providing some services that involve library staff working on-site for the first time since March.
Beginning Tuesday, researchers can request books from the Widener, Lamont, and Harvard Depository collections and pick them up in the entryway to Lamont library. This means that librarians can now fulfill some requests for books that have been waiting since the libraries closed in March.
“Books that were on hold the day we shut the doors are still on hold,” Assogba and Burchsted wrote.
Only books that are not available on HathiTrust will be available for pickup, Assogba and Burchsted wrote in an additional update posted to the Harvard Library website. HathiTrust, an online digital repository, has provided temporary access to the full texts of some books and journals held by the Harvard libraries to Harvard affiliates during the COVID pandemic.
“HathiTrust Emergency Access is expected to continue as long as library service is limited,” Assogba and Burchsted wrote.
Librarians will also now be able to scan and deliver materials from Widener, Lamont, Countway, and the Harvard Depository, Assogba and Burchsted wrote on the website. For any scan-and-deliver request, “we will do our best to find a digital version for you,” Assogba and Burchsted wrote in the online update.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 first announced plans for a “phased reopening” of Harvard’s libraries, museums, and labs May 5. In an early June interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, head librarian Martha Whitehead said the Library planned to expand on-request access to books to other locations after implementing the Lamont, Widener, and Depository pickup option.
She added at the time that the Library will alter its workflow to minimize potential transmission of COVID-19 on surfaces and is “monitoring research on how the virus survives on different types of library materials.”
“Further down the road, as circumstances allow for greater population density, we will resume user access to physical libraries, likely under new limitations,” Whitehead told the Gazette.
The libraries also plan on making more materials available remotely as the fall semester approaches, according to Assogba and Burchsted’s Tuesday email. They added that University affiliates should submit requests for materials to be digitized for fall research and coursework “as soon as possible.”
“Several special collections, including Harvard Archives, Houghton and Schlesinger, are planning to digitize, where possible, material needed for Fall courses,” they wrote.

The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order Monday that endorses H. 3924, a bill under consideration in the Massachusetts State Legislature that promotes tenant protections and would repeal a statewide ban on rent control.
The City Council passed the order by a vote of 8-1.
Rent control, a practice that restricts the amount a landlord can charge a tenant, has been banned in Massachusetts since 1994. State legislators originally proposed H. 3924 in 2019, but the issue has taken on a newfound urgency due to the prospect of foreclosures during the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic.
The City Council also passed the Tenant Resource Notification Act, which requires tenants to be provided with their rights during an eviction process, during Monday’s session.
Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui highlighted the short-term measures Cambridge has taken to protect tenants during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in an emailed statement.
“In the meantime, the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund has provided rental assistance to over 1,400 residents and families during the pandemic, with another set of funds becoming available soon,” Siddiqui wrote. “We will also be providing another $1 million in rent stabilization from the Community Preservation Act Fund for residents at risk of losing their home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Siddiqui wrote that she supports H. 3924 because it is a “critical step” for towns to “prevent tenant displacement.”
“We want to better protect our renters during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and this bill will give us the opportunity to provide creative and new solutions for our residents,” Siddiqui wrote.
Harvard’s chapter of Young Democratic Socialists of America supported the policy order. Piper W. Winkler ’21, president of Harvard YSDA, said the group encouraged students to make their voices heard in the debate over the policy order.
“I was really heartened to see that a lot of people recognize the fact that as Harvard students, they are part of the larger Cambridge community. And they should use their voice when they can to advocate for justice in that community,” Winkler said.
Several College students offered virtual comments in support of the policy order during the session.
Kai DeJesus '23 challenged the necessity of the policy debate in her remarks, saying that it was a “bare-minimum measure” that would “protect the most marginalized among us.”
Benjamin B. Roberts '23 argued that councilors had a responsibility to their constituents to pass the policy order.
"This is a statement in favor of the people,” he said. “It is a statement of support for something that could save people from homelessness and housing insecurity. It says that you care about the people under your jurisdiction, that they can have housing stability.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, a federal judge allowed Harvard’s motion to dismiss former undergraduate Damilare Sonoiki’s lawsuit alleging the College unfairly refused to grant him his bachelor’s degree after three fellow students accused him of sexual assault.
Sonoiki filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Oct. 21, 2019, arguing Harvard should not have withheld his degree after the Administrative Board — which adjudicated complaints of sexual harassment in 2013 — found the three allegations against Sonoiki credible and recommended his dismissal.
Sonoiki contended that the Ad Board and Faculty Council decisions were “void” because Harvard no longer had any jurisdiction over him after his scheduled graduation date. He also argued that he should have received his degree because he was in good standing at the time of graduation.
Judge Denise J. Casper wrote, however, that Sonoiki’s logic failed to presume the inverse interpretation of the statement in Harvard’s Student Handbook.
“While the Handbook asserts that a student who is not in good standing or against whom a disciplinary charge is pending cannot receive a degree, it does not require that a student who is in good standing and against whom a formal disciplinary charge is not yet pending receive his degree,” Casper wrote.
She also cited Harvard’s Student Information Form, which states that a student cannot receive a degree before the resolution of a disciplinary case, and that a disciplinary case always begins with an allegation of student misconduct in the form of a complaint or report.
Sonoiki's complaint further claimed that Harvard denied him “adequate notice” of the charges against him, the opportunity to be advised by an attorney of his choosing, and the right to question or confront witnesses.
Casper wrote that Harvard’s refusal to allow Sonoiki an attorney advisor and confidentiality with his Administrative Board representative, as well as Harvard’s failure to disclose the identities of adverse witnesses are all consistent with the terms of its contract with students, defined as the student handbook and ancillary documents. She added that Sonoiki was given adequate notice of the charges against him.
Sonoiki also claimed Harvard breached its contract because the complaints filed against him were “untimely” and the process for resolution of his disciplinary process was “unduly long.”
Casper wrote that neither the Student Handbook nor the Student Information Form make promises regarding the timeliness of complaints or as to the length of disciplinary processes. She further noted that the Ad Board does not convene during the summer and that the Student Information Form states the length of a disciplinary case depends upon the amount of information the Ad Board receives during an investigation.
“Notably, Harvard was investigating three, separate complaints of sexual assault against Sonoiki from three complainants and time periods remote from one another and the subcommittee investigated and prepared a separate report for each claim,” Casper also wrote.
Finally, Sonoiki accuses Harvard of employing an adjudicatory process “riddled” with implicit and explicit racial bias. He cited the fact that there were no Black men serving on the 30-person Ad Board during the 2012-2013 academic year.
The judge wrote that Sonoiki failed to substantiate his claim of racial bias beyond “inference and speculation,” citing precedent that states subjective belief that one is a victim of discrimination is insufficient to satisfy the burden of proof.
“[Sonoiki] has not stated any facts supporting a claim that those individuals involved in the adjudication of the disciplinary cases against him were biased,” Casper wrote.
Sonoiki wrote in an emailed statement that he and his legal team intend to bring an appeal to the First Circuit. In his initial filing, he demanded the conference of his degree, the reversal of the Ad Board’s decision, and a substantive sum in damages.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Monday afternoon that Harvard has dropped its social group sanctions as a result of a recent Supreme Court decision on sex discrimination, dismantling Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s most high-profile undertaking since beginning his post.
In 2016, Harvard rolled out its social group policy barring members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations — starting with the Class of 2021 — from holding leadership positions in student groups and athletic teams and from receiving College endorsement for certain postgraduate fellowships.
The policy, Khurana’s brainchild, was intended to reconfigure campus life by minimizing the influence of elite, male-dominated spaces. His history with those spaces is long, stretching back well before he became Dean.
As early as 2011, Khurana criticized the clubs for siphoning energy from house communities.
“I’m always suspicious of a club that builds itself on gendered exclusivity,” he said at the time. “It’s so much easier to hang out with people who remind you of your favorite person — yourself — than it is to figure out how to create an organic real community that has strength in its diversity.”
In 2014, he characterized a circulated party invitation sent by the Spee Club as “offensive, crude, and sexist.” He asserted that the invitation, which featured women in underwear, ran “counter to the values we hold as a community.” Before Harvard officially announced the sanctions, Khurana had issued an April 15 deadline for final clubs in March 2016 to inform administrators whether or not they planned to go co-ed.
When groups failed to comply, and the sanctions went into effect, Khurana lambasted the final clubs as bastions of male privilege and hot spots of predatory behavior towards women.
“[T]he discriminatory membership policies of these organizations have led to the perpetuation of spaces that are rife with power imbalances,” he wrote at the time. “The most entrenched of these spaces send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men. In their recruitment practices and through their extensive resources and access to networks of power, these organizations propagate exclusionary values .”
Shortly after Bacow’s announced the dissolution of the social group policy on Monday, Khurana reiterated his defense of the sanctions as a measure to combat gender discrimination at the College in an email to students.
“While Harvard is withdrawing the policy, I still strongly believe that gender discrimination undermines our community’s values,” he wrote.
Though the policy Khurana championed failed to last long enough to face even its first review period — scheduled for its fifth year — rarely did a significant period pass during which it failed to generate news.
Khurana first floated the possibility of the sanctions in April 2016, at a behind-closed-doors meeting with final club leadership.
A month later, former University President Drew G. Faust announced that she would accept Khurana’s first public proposals to regulate unrecognized single gender organizations in response to the recommendations of a University-wide report on sexual assault prevention.
Marking a historic policy reversal for the University, the decision drew national attention and incited polarized reactions from students, faculty, varsity coaches, and members of the Harvard Corporation. In 1984, Harvard had issued a comparable ultimatum for clubs to go co-ed, which spurred mass disaffiliation from the University. In the interim decades, administrators largely opted to avoid involvement in final clubs and Greek groups.
After some professors alleged faculty members were not properly consulted during the policy's formulation, Khurana co-chaired a committee to revise or replace the sanctions in 2017. The committee released its preliminary recommendation in July, opting to ban all social groups, including gender neutral ones.
Though the committee claimed strong majority support for the proposal, The Crimson reported in July that only seven members of the 27-member committee voted in favor of the ban.
Three months later, the committee published a final report suggesting three options in the bam’s stead: The original May 2016 policy, a complete ban of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, or a set of “other possible solutions.”
In December, the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted in support of the sanctions. This atypical intervention in undergraduate life was aimed at ensure the decision extended beyond Faust’s presidency after she stepped down in June 2018.
In the four years since their inauguration, the sanctions have forced nearly all of Harvard’s all-female social organizations to open their doors to men, while largely failing to change the membership policies of male-only groups.
Every single all-women’s social club eventually opted to go co-ed, though Harvard’s chapter of Alpha Phi later returned to campus as a single-gender group after a hiatus.
Meanwhile, several male-only fraternities and final clubs — including the Porcellian, the A.D., the Fly, the Owl, and the Phoenix S.K. — continued operating in defiance of Harvard’s rules. The Fox Club flirted with co-ed status at several points, ultimately choosing to remain all-male after facing resistance from its graduate board.
In late 2019, the sanctions spawned a pair of lawsuits in state court and federal court by a group of fraternities, sororities, and anonymous students. The federal filing accused Harvard of breaching Title IX, a federal law designed to protect against gender-based discrimination in education.
Earlier this month, the United States Supreme Court separately handed down a landmark decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, ruling that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination against BGLTQ workers.
After the Court’s decision, the Harvard Corporation recognized that its rationale might have significant consequences for the sanctions based on U.S. District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton’s legal reasoning in his decision to deny Harvard’s motion to dismiss the suit in August 2019. Gorton accepted the plaintiffs’ legal theory that the policy, although adopted to counteract discrimination based on sex, is itself an instance of discrimination based on sex.
After University administrators concluded the Bostock decision effectively determined that Harvard would lose the lawsuit and “be legally barred from further enforcing the policy,” the Corporation voted to rescind its prior approval of the sanctions.
It remains unclear whether former single-gender organizations will abandon their co-ed status and re-adopt more restrictive membership policies in response to the change.
Khurana concluded his email Monday afternoon by urging students to act on the principles that fueled the sanctions, even in their absence.
“I hope that for each of you that work will begin by examining the organizations you participate in, and asking yourselves who has access, and why. And I hope that you will consider making changes from within those organizations even in the absence of a College policy,” he wrote. “I am committed to working with you as you think about what kind of organizations you wish to build, both on and off campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In court filings this week, a trove of documents — including internal Harvard communications and official reports — were released as part of the federal lawsuit over sanctions on members of final clubs and single-gender Greek organizations.
The College announced a set of sanctions against members of final clubs and single-gender Greek organizations in 2016, barring those students from receiving athletics captaincies, leadership positions in extracurricular groups, and sponsorship for prestigious fellowships. First applied to the Class of 2021, the sanctions received intense scrutiny and spawned a pair of lawsuits in state court and federal court.
On Monday, however, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced Harvard will drop the sanctions following a landmark United States Supreme Court Case, Bostock v. Clayton County, which Harvard said made clear federal courts would rule against the social group policies.
The filings came as part of an injunction filed by the plaintiffs in the federal case on the same day as Bacow’s announcement, obtained during the discovery phase of the lawsuit.
The documents, which date back to 2015, chronicle efforts by, among others, former University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana — both of whom were principal architects and supporters of the sanctions — to form and implement the sanctions policy.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on the documents.
The earliest document dates back to March 2015, where in an email to the College’s Dean of Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba, Khurana proposes three possible paths: “reform the Clubs,” “marginalize their importance on campus,” or take “more dramatic action.”
In her response, Thimba wrote that the abolition of final clubs should not be the College’s end goal.
“Marginalizing the clubs as you've described means creating real competition for their brand of entertainment - better parties elsewhere where we have more control of the gender dynamics (and alcohol consumption),” she wrote. “I don't think shutting them down ought to be our goal. It's too assailable and it'll harden the resistance. I'm not sure what other dramatic actions there are.”
The documents also show that, in the early phase of conceiving the sanctions, administrators and committees struggled to define the scope of their task and combat misconceptions about the sanctions that developed among Harvard affiliates.
Chief among these was the perception that administrators developed the sanctions in order to combat sexual assaults reported in final clubs. According to one document — a list of talking points sent by Thimba to Khurana — the proportion of total sexual assault reports occurring in final clubs from the same year totaled 15 percent. The list goes on to note that the emphasis should be placed on the “outsize influence” of final clubs on campus, rather than on assault.
In the 2016 minutes of an Implementation Committee outreach meeting, students questioned whether the policies sought to curb sexual assault reports at final clubs.
Kay K. Shelemay — a professor of Music and African and African American Studies — told the students outright that the policy would not be meant to address sexual assault.
“Our formal charge is to address non-discrimination, not sexual assault,” she said.
A student — identified only as a member of the Harvard Islamic Society — said they found the strategy of focusing gender discrimination puzzling.
“Your committee is trying to address a cultural problem, through a strange policy by attacking gender,” they said. “But we know it's actually a problem of a culture that tolerates inequality and sexism.”
Several of the documents also addressed the fact that some groups affected by the sanctions would be collateral damage as part of the larger effort to reform or shutter final clubs. After sanctions went into effect, student interest in sororities plummeted, eventually resulting in the end of once-all female social groups, though sorority Alpha Phi returned four months after they initially decided to shutter.
In the same outreach meeting, students questioned what impact the sanctions might have on such groups, and asked if the committee had considered them. In response Shelemay acknowledged that this could be a blind spot in the policies.
“We're aware of this hiccup in the policy and the possibility of collateral damage to other orgs with meritorious goals,” she said. “We are going to try to protect against collateral damage to organizations that are trying to do good work.”
Concern that women’s single-gender groups would be “collateral damage” surfaced in several other filings, including a May 2016 correspondence between Khurana and Jane Rosenzweig, director of the Writing Center. In an email, Rosenzweig wrote that acknowledging the formation of single-gender women’s groups as a reactionary counterbalance to “male-dominated culture” was a way to justify sanctions that would affect women as well.
“In other words, yes, it makes perfect sense that women found value in these organizations while they were shut out of access to others, but there is something wrong with the fact that they had to do this in the first place,” she wrote.
“Exactly the point we would like to make,” Khurana wrote in response. “I don't want to institutionalize ‘separate but equal.’”
Khurana also sought advice from Former University President Lawrence H. Summers. In a 2016 email chain, Summers advised Khurana to focus on the “exclusivity” of clubs rather than the single-gender aspect. He also warned about the power of final club alumni.
“I'd be careful here. The Harvard Corp for many years even after [Faust] was president had members who were members of all male clubs!” Summers wrote.
Khurana also asked Summers for his opinion on more recently-formed fraternities and sororities at the College.
“I hate all of it,” Summers replied.
While the Supreme Court, not the Executive Branch, ultimately felled the sanctions, Khurana also commented on how the 2016 presidential election might impact the policies in the same email chain with Summers.
“It is a free country, but the Office of Civil Rights (which I will take as a representative of the country and assuming that the next President will likely be from the Democratic Party) insists that we have a responsibility for students--for all our students--including when they are in private spaces that are not controlled by the university,” he wrote.
Several documents in the court filings reveal Harvard’s concern about alumni reaction to the sanctions. A presentation given to the Harvard Corporation in January 2016 acknowledged the perception that the University will not act because it “fears” alumni. A 2017 report to the Board of Overseers also noted that Harvard’s historical difficulties dealing with final clubs were exacerbated by alumni involvement.
“Because Harvard withdrew recognition from the male Final Clubs more than 30 years ago, this issue has been chronically difficult to address, and the problem has been compounded by the intercession of the Alumni of some of the Clubs who are reluctant to change long-standing policies,” the report states.
The court filings also include communications from several alumni to Khurana criticizing the policy. In a 2016 email, Rachael A. Wagner ’04 criticized the policy and argued it unfairly hurt women’s groups. Wagner attributed winning her Rhodes Scholarship to the confidence she gained as a member of the Seneca.
“The way to win the battle against the male final clubs (and against sexual assault, since isn’t that really what you're trying to prevent?) isn’t to infringe on students’ rights to associate with whomever they like, especially when they are doing so on their own time with their own resources, but rather to provide a more attractive supply of social spaces and social events that will make the all-male final clubs’ parties less appealing by comparison,” she wrote.
In two emails sent in May and July 2017, Papa R. Chakravarthy ’12 said he would withhold donations to the University in protesty of the policy.
The second email, which questioned the process of developing sanctions as well as Khurana’s motivation, prompted a strongly worded response from the Dean.
“Papa—I want to ask you a question: do you think this controversy is enjoyable for me or anyone at the College?” Khurana wrote. “Harvard’s culture of belonging and inclusion needs to be improved in order to attract the best students and faculty.”
“I am not perfect. My students and colleagues know me as a candid and trustworthy person. I am glad to engage you on substance, but would appreciate you leaving out the ad hominem accusations about my motivations,” he added.
