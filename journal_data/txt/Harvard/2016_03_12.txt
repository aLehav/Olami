After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The love bug strikes Alexandria once again! For the record, current notable couples include Rick and Michonne (a.k.a. Richonne), Glenn and Maggie, Abraham and Sasha/Rosita, and Tara and Denise. Out of left field comes another burgeoning romance between Carol and one of the more recognizable—yet still extraneous—residents of the town. In fact, these two characters probably had their first substantial on-screen conversation this episode, featuring an exchange that should be the model for all future romantic dialogue. “Do you think of me as a mother?” Carol asks, to which our fine gentlemen replies, “No. To me you’re something else.” Cue kiss. To be fair, in a time and place where Netflix no longer exists, these people need to have fun somehow.
“Not Tomorrow Yet” spends its first half touring Alexandria’s dating scene, dipping viewers into the sometimes intentionally awkward dialogue between partners about typical relationship topics like their probabilities of not dying in the foreseeable future. It’s one of the show’s more egalitarian episodes, giving every character a moment to consider his or her motivations and allowing the show to reclarify their stakes. The result is a mixed first half, composed of disparate, rushed moments of sentiment between our favorite survivors. After presumably becoming tired of being angry with each other, Morgan and Carol finally reconcile their frustratingly recursive philosophical disagreement over killing people. In addition, Abraham’s breakup with Rosita on the eve of one of their most important and dangerous missions ends with the statement: “When I first met you, I thought you were the only woman left on Earth. Well, you’re not.” Abraham may not be the most emotionally mindful redneck, but this line reaches an entirely new level of romantic incompetence. It is unclear whether the fault should lie with the writers or with the viewers for overestimating Abraham’s common sense. At any rate, Abraham is no Don Juan.
What follows the show’s valiant efforts towards character development is a convergent, tight heist sequence that devolves into a combination of stupidity and cold bloodshed. Rick and company finally execute their invasion into Negan’s compound and, perhaps unsurprisingly, emerge relatively unscathed. Negan is still disappointingly nowhere to be found, raising the valid question of whether he has been a red herring this entire time. Crazy Rick yet again displays an unmatched ruthlessness, killing Negan’s goons in their sleep and in cold blood without hesitation. In stark contrast, Glenn’s teary breakdown highlights his continual spiritual and moral degradation. His regret and guilt in the face of his incoming child only further foreshadows an unfair karmic death. The group’s advantage of surprise is taken away when Sasha and Abraham suddenly lose their ability to effectively kill one loose goon. They opt to stab him in the stomach rather than literally anywhere else, thereby granting him the ability to quickly activate the conveniently-placed fire alarm before dying. The group is then forced to gun down the rest of the compound. They miraculously experience no casualties or injuries because even Negan’s goons attended Stormtrooper Academy.
“Not Tomorrow Yet” consists of a disappointing smorgasbord of hokey conversations somewhat redeemed by a slickly filmed yet predictable heist on Negan’s compound. How often must “The Walking Dead” remind viewers that these survivors are continually losing their humanity by engaging in these acts of merciless violence? The show is reaching the point where we have seen the same look of guilt on these characters’ faces one too many times. Morgan’s impractical creed of nonviolence and redemption is becoming more compelling as the show continues to follow the same rhythms of bloodshed and ultraviolence. The show unfortunately delays Negan’s appearance yet again, and the Carol and Maggie hostage cliffhanger comes off as a filibuster—another plot obstruction to what viewers really want to see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s hockey team, a return to Lake Placid now lies just 60 minutes away.
Sophomore Seb Lloyd and junior Sean Malone each logged two goals apiece in the Crimson’s postseason debut on Friday, lifting No. 12/12 Harvard to a 5-2 win over Rensselaer in Game 1 of the ECAC tournament quarterfinals at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
Entering the weekend a notch above the NCAA tournament bubble, the Crimson (17-9-4, 12-6-4 ECAC) took hold of the driver’s seat in the series with a three-goal second period bookended by strikes from its newfound scoring threat.
With Harvard already up 1-0, Lloyd set his big night into gear less than three minutes into the middle frame. Dancing around defenseman Mike Prapavessis to get his linemate the puck, freshman Ryan Donato fed Lloyd in the slot, and the sophomore beat Engineer goaltender Jason Kasdorf to the short side at 2:56.
Then with 4:22 to go in the period and the Crimson leading 3-0, the underclassman duo connected a second time, as Lloyd redirected a Donato blast from the point past Kasdorf, prompting RPI coach Seth Appert to pull his star netminder.
“He’s definitely one of the best goalies in college hockey,” said Lloyd of Kasdorf, who prior to Friday had stopped 92 of Harvard’s last 93 shots against him. “We had a game plan just to get traffic in front of him and pepper him with shots. It’s kind of nice to chase a goalie of that caliber. It gives us a little confidence going into the next game, and maybe [it] got in his head a little bit.”
With his first career multi-goal game, Lloyd now has scored four times in his last five contests—an impressive flip of the script for a sophomore who previously had just five goals in 52 appearances.
“Seb’s a guy who arrived here with a pretty good offensive resume,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[The offense] maybe didn’t come as quickly as we all would have liked, but really in this second half of the season—I think ever since the Christmas tournament—he’s been able to find the back of the net and get himself to the dirty areas of the ice.”
Lloyd’s second goal snapped an 0-for-11 Crimson power-play drought against the Engineers (18-14-7, 8-7-7), one of only two ECAC teams who had a perfect kill percentage this season against the nation’s top special teams unit. RPI survived two minutes shorthanded just prior to the goal, but junior Jake Wood left his side down an Engineer for five after kneeing co-captain Kyle Criscuolo in the neutral zone; and with extra time to work with, Harvard took advantage.
Nonetheless, so did RPI. Senior center Milos Bubela was quick to negate the Lloyd tip, picking off an attempted pass from Criscuolo to Donato by the Engineer blue line on the tail end of the Wood penalty and beating sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen five-hole on the breakaway that followed.
RPI tacked on another with less than five minutes gone in the third, as senior defenseman Phil Hampton put home a loose puck down low to pull the Engineers within two.
But that was as much of a comeback as RPI could engineer. Just prior to the 10-minute mark in the third, Malone added his second goal of the night, moving right-to-left on second-string goalie Cam Hackett and sliding a shot past his right pad to put the Crimson back in control.
Malone’s first goal of the night, which came at 17:02 in the first period, fell seven seconds shy of bringing Harvard’s power-play woes against RPI to an end a little sooner. Just after the Engineers completed the game's first kill, Malone utilized a Luke Esposito pick at the blue line to enter the slot, then rocketed a glove-side wrister past Kasdorf to put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
Esposito assisted on both Malone goals, as well as a Colin Blackwell tally in the second period, giving the junior left-winger a career-high three helpers on the night. But his first assist proved to be the most important, as Harvard had gone most of the first frame without many scoring chances.
In fact, despite being outshot, 43-27, for the game, RPI threw more shots on net than the Crimson in the opening frame.
“I thought we outplayed them in the first period and didn’t get rewarded for it,” Appert said. “I thought we were better than them...yet they made a play to get up 1-0 [and] escape that period, and then their urgency level was real high in the first seven, eight minutes of the second period.”
As Appert alluded to, after logging just 10 shots on goal in the first frame, the Crimson opened the floodgates in the second. In less than four minutes of second-period action, Harvard had already logged nine shots, among which was Lloyd’s first score. By period’s end, the Crimson had outshot the Engineers, 22-6, over the frame.
Harvard will now look to close out the best-of-three series Saturday night, as a win would both secure the Crimson’s spot in the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid and improve its case for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
Meanwhile, despite being pushed to the brink of elimination, Appert says his side will not resort to playing desperate hockey in Game 2.
“You don’t want to be desperate; desperate’s dumb usually,” Appert said. “You want real, real playoff urgency, but usually desperate hockey is dumb hockey. And you can’t play dumb. You’ve got to play with a dramatic amount of urgency and fight.”
“We’ve had our backs against the wall since day one this year,” he continued. “We’ve faced this before, and I’m not worried at all about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: March 12, 2016, at 11:32 a.m.
Just shy of a month ago, the now-No. 12/12 Harvard men’s hockey team was unable to solve Rensselaer goaltender Jason Kasdorf. The Crimson launched 50 shots on goal against the Engineers at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center but only managed to sneak one past the senior netminder, falling 2-1 despite outshooting its opponent by 28.
This time around, Harvard once again found a way to get shots to the net. But beating Kasdorf proved less daunting of a challenge.
Generating numerous chances all night and spending the majority of the contest in the offensive zone, the Crimson rode the game's first four goals to a 5-2 win over RPI in the first game of the ECAC quarterfinals.
“I thought our energy and effort was there right from the start,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 said. “We made some plays and were able to use our speed to finish off a few opportunities.”
BACK WITH A BANG
Two weeks after suffering an injury in the Crimson’s contest against No. 15/- Cornell, junior forward Sean Malone opened the scoring for Harvard on the night. The Buffalo Sabres prospect took the puck in from just above the blue line to the high slot, using a screen to fire a wrister that beat Kasdorf above the left pad. The junior added some insurance in the third period, racing down the right boards and cutting left, dragging Kasdorf out just enough to wrap it around his right pad for his second goal of the night.
After a slow start in the goal department to begin the year, Malone has provided a scoring threat for the team in the second half of the season. The junior’s first 10 games—which, for him, included all of 2015—came and went without him finding twine. But after breaking his goalless streak in the team’s 4-3 win over Minnesota in the Mariucci Classic, the West Seneca, N.Y., native has averaged more than half a goal per game.
Friday’s contest marked the second time Malone has come back this year after having missed a multi-game stretch due to injury. In all, the junior has missed 22 games over the last two seasons.
“With some of the injuries we’ve had, we’ve had to juggle some people around,” Donato said. “But we have good depth.”
HIGH TENSIONS
Chippiness was exhibited from the very early stages of the contest, with multiple whistles leading to pushing and shoving across the ice.
“I think it’s just playoff hockey,” sophomore Seb Lloyd said. “After every whistle, you kind of want to get the other team off of their game.”
The tension came to a climax at the 13:27 mark in the second period when RPI winger Jake Wood kneed co-captain Kyle Criscuolo in the neutral zone, sending Criscuolo crashing to the ice and resulting in a five-minute major and a game misconduct for Wood.
The Crimson was able to extend its lead to four on the extended man-advantage with Lloyd’s fifth goal of the season, but only temporarily. An offensive zone turnover led to a Milos Bubela breakaway, where the senior was able to open sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen’s five-hole and sneak it through to put the Engineers on the board with less than two minutes remaining in the second period.
Scuffles continued into the final minutes of the game, with Jesper Ohrvall ripping off sophomore Jake Horton’s helmet after Madsen froze a puck with 1:18 left in the contest.
(NOT A) PLAYOFF ATMOSPHERE
Despite Friday night marking the beginning of the playoffs for the Crimson, the crowd at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center resembled that of an early-season contest rather than one that could help determine whether Harvard advances to the next round of its conference tournament.
With the final day of classes before Spring Recess having concluded and most students having departed from campus, the Harvard student section was sparsely populated. Most of the stands were a sea of Crimson—not because of the Harvard faithful donning its colors, but because the Crimson-colored seats were largely empty.
The underwhelming crowd did not quell any chippiness, however.
“It’s playoff hockey,” RPI coach Seth Appert said. “[Tomorrow] should be [as chippy as tonight]. Maybe more.”
