After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Calling in from his theater in Needham, Igor Golyak opens the conversation with an initial sense of calm, despite the circumstances — Russia has only very recently invaded Ukraine, the country from which he emigrated to the United States in his childhood.
The calmness suits him: Golyak, the founder and the artistic director of the Arlekin Players Theatre, has devoted much of his life’s work to telling the stories of the oppressed and the marginalized.
Arlekin’s most recent production, “Witness,” tells the story of the 1939 voyage of MS St. Louis and the 937 Jews aboard who unsuccessfully sought refuge in North America from the atrocities of Nazi Germany. “One of the ideas of “Witness” was that we’re witnessing a horrific event,” Golyak says. “During that time, there was a letter sent to President Roosevelt and all sorts of meetings and all sorts of things. But nobody accepted the people. A third of them died, and they could have been saved.”
Golyak, who is himself Jewish, implores the U.S. to see the parallels between this catastrophic event and the terrors of the present day. “We’re witnessing … the same shit,” he said.
The reality of the present situation in Ukraine prompted him to do something more with his position at the Arlekin Players Theatre. “I don’t want to make a fucking play about it again. We’re still not cutting off the air, the sky,” he said. “We’re still deciding whether to pay $3 extra at the gas station or if we should let 10,000 more people die from the bombings. That’s what we’re deciding, and that’s what we’re witnessing.”
“Does art help? Does art change people? No, it probably doesn’t,” he said. And so, rather than make another play about it, Golyak and his theater launched #ArtistsForUkraine, a social media campaign dedicated to soliciting donations and sending video messages of support from U.S.-based artists to the people of Ukraine. So far, they have raised over $20,000 for the humanitarian organization Nova Ukraine. More recently, they directed their efforts towards helping provide shelter and clothing for Ukrainians fleeing the invasion. The theater company’s work has not gone unnoticed in the art world, receiving messages of support from A-listers such as Mark Ruffalo and theater world heavyweights like Jessica Hecht.
Golyak focuses on messages of support and fundraising because he “doesn’t know what else he can do.” And despite Arlekin’s success, Golyak thinks that the actions taken so far are still inadequate. “The purpose is to try to stop the killing, and to raise awareness. It’s just not enough right now,” he said.
But he believes that individuals can help by pressuring politicians to send immediate help to the people of Ukraine.
Though one of Golyak’s recommendations to block off Ukrainian airspace from Russia remains fraught with unresolved political questions, the U.S. government did move forward with a ban on imports of Russian fossil fuels in the weeks since the interview.
Regardless of how one chooses to act, Golyak made clear that, to him, taking action to the greatest extent that one can is what matters in times of global crisis. “Our children are going to ask us, what did you do? What did you do,” he said. “Just like after World War Two, everybody, everybody was on the hook.
For Golyak, this means taking what he does best — creating art — and bringing it out of the past and the realm of the fictional to the here and now, leveraging his position and his knowledge to try to make as much change as possible. It is now up to the rest of us to think quickly and critically about how we — as individuals, as a collective — are best able to try and make a similar effort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Claud Mintz, known professionally as Claud, wouldn't necessarily describe themself as a poet. The alternative indie artist tries to approach songwriting as literally as possible, without any sugarcoating or unnecessary embellishments. Each song they write acts as a vehicle for expressing themself more directly and openly. “I think for the most part, when I write songs, it's things that I want to say to somebody but don't know how to,” they said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Perhaps that's why songs like 2019’s “Wish You Were Gay” appear so honest. When Claud sings, “I wish you were gay so you could just hold me / Call me your babe instead of your homie,” their voice light and lifting over a driving piano melody, they mean exactly that. Speaking about their straightforward approach to songwriting, Claud said, “In a way, that makes it more accessible to people who aren't English majors. They sometimes just want to hear what I'm feeling.” That authenticity is what Claud has been striving to develop over more than four years spent writing and releasing music.
After self-releasing several bedroom pop EPs under the names Claud and Toast, Claud became the first artist signed to Phoebe Bridgers’s record label, Saddest Factory, an imprint of Dead Oceans that has since signed other indie artists like MUNA and Sloppy Jane. And just last month, Claud released their debut album “Super Monster,” a vibrant and self-aware coming-of-age album that served as the followup to their 2020 EP “Gay and Bored,” and their first album release on the new label. The album — which features the ’90s-inspired, lovelorn single “Soft Spot” and other standouts like “Gold” and “Pepsi” — was critically acclaimed and set the stage for a headlining tour that has kept Claud on the road since late February.
The album proved a crucial opportunity for Claud to grow as an artist and musician, helping them further cement their sound and aesthetic process. “Finding my voice and my vision as an artist has been a never-ending process, but making an album really helped me,” they said of writing “Super Monster.” “I think I've learned a lot about myself as an artist…. [Because] if you're releasing an album and you don't know what you're saying, then why are you releasing an album, you know?” Most of the songs on the album are pulled directly from real experiences. They were written largely in private, and Claud said that it often “felt like nobody ever was gonna care, or relate, or hear [them].”
Of course, Claud's recent experiences as the supporting act for Bleachers fall 2021 tour and now touring “Super Monster” as the headlining act has brought those songs directly to thousands of fans. “I've done like a ton of support tours to the point where I wasn't even sure if people would even come to my own show,” Claud said of their current touring experience, adding that “it's been a very grounding experience.”
Claud has taken a lot of what they learned while album-making, lessons about what it means to create art meaningfully and with purpose, on the road. The priority is to make each show on the nearly three-months long world tour across North America and Europe unique, special, and inviting. Speaking of the planning that goes into each stop of the tour, Claud said, “I realized, like, 'Okay, I have a responsibility for the people coming to my show and the type of show they're going to experience.’” That means thinking beyond the actual music as it was recorded on the album in order to get at a more cohesive and exciting concert experience.
Due to a catalog that is heavily reliant on synths and other digital production elements, live shows also bring with them an opportunity for Claud to rethink their music. They said that putting on a live show isn’t that different from producing an album; it’s an inherently creative and dynamic process. “Sometimes I have to find ways around or find alternate ways or just sacrifice parts of [my songs] for the live show to make it more epic of an experience,” they said. “My mind goes wild over the endless possibilities of what the song could turn into live.” While a lot of their music isn’t in the rock genre, Claud still finds a way to rock out on stage; “I've turned a lot of them into rock songs for like a live version of it.”
Touring has its difficulties — Claud said that they’ve seen a lot of catcalling at their shows and their friends’ shows, and they recently had to remind fans to wear masks — but it also provides an avenue for meaningful connection with fans beyond streaming services and social media. (Of the latter, Claud said that while they like posting and documenting their life, they think it would be healthier for all involved if “everybody could experience it more casually than they do.”) Performing in venues across the country means that Claud is able to interact with fans in a more intimate way. If even one person really connects with the music, if one person gets to hear a song that means a lot to them, Claud considers it a success. “As cheesy as it sounds, it's like a very real thing to be able to, like, experience that with that one person,” they said.
That relationship between a writer and their audience is especially important when honesty is the goal, as it is for Claud. This drive for sincerity can even get in the way of their songwriting process. Often, Claud says, “I'm like, 'I don't know what's right for the second verse because I've said everything I needed to say, so I'm just gonna like tap into some creative writing here.'” The result is lyricism that is beautifully candid and heart-achingly relatable, perfectly balanced with sparkling pop and lo-fi melodies.
It’s not an exaggeration to say that Claud’s career over the past couple of years could best be described as a whirlwind — though they don’t necessarily see it that way. “When things are gradual, and everything is like a small step, it's hard to be like, ‘Oh my god, like, this is crazy.’ Because I've done so much work to get to it,” Claud said of the trajectory of their career so far. They’re so close to their work that it’s difficult to see outside of it sometimes — that’s where their parents come in: “They're so far from the music industry or any sort of entertainment industry that, to them, everything is a really big deal.”
Indeed, Claud’s parents serve as grounding forces when Claud starts to lose track of how far they’ve come. When Claud performed at L.A.’s The Troubadour earlier this month, it was their mom who reminded them what a momentous occasion that was. “She was like, this is really special and a big deal that a lot of people don't get,” they recalled. “I feel really lucky that my parents appreciate those things that sometimes I would forget to appreciate.”
So, what’s next for Claud after a new album and several months on the road? “I think I've always wanted to get a dog. So every tour. I'm like, after this tour ends I'm gonna get a dog! And I’ve been saying that forever so we’ll see.” It’s important to note that their dog of choice is a “tiny little rescue dog.” They also look forward to seeing their friends and spending some time at home. In the meantime, they’ll be ‘going wild’ on their last week of U.S. shows and “trying to like soak it up and feel very grateful for it.”
Claud will perform at Boston’s Brighton Music Hall this Sunday, March 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the early days of my freshman fall, I left a friend stunned by a revelation of my 3 a.m. weekday shenanigans. Every other night, I walked down alone from Pennypacker Hall to the CVS at the corner of Mass. Ave and JFK Street — untethered to a can of pepper spray.
He proceeded to ask me if I really felt that safe as a woman in Cambridge — safe enough to warrant a claim to hours beyond midnight and the absence of self defense in my back pocket.
I responded almost defensively. Since childhood, I’ve been accustomed to being catcalled on the street, feigning phone calls in an Uber, and waking up to a new case of curbside assault everyday — despite growing up in one of the safer cities of urban India. Cambridge, then, seemed a world away from the explicit harassment that so characterized my adolescence. After all, I was no longer photographed by men on the street, stared at in public spaces, or cornered in alleyways.
The “I’m safer here than I am there” rationale is arguable, but I continue to subscribe to it. Late into freshman year, I no longer look back home to justify my 3 a.m. pursuits. I only need to look next door — at the statistics of on-campus assault at Harvard. Instances of assault here are far more unnerving than those back home, for the immediacy and familiarity of the perpetrators. I feel no safer in class than I do on Mass. Ave, so I deliberately lay claim to the hours and places I’m cautioned against.
Just as unnerving is the administration’s response to assault. On paper, they demonstrate an awareness of these statistics and an effort to address them: the 2017 split of the Title IX Office, the implementation of mandatory training for faculty and students, the establishment of anonymous disclosure, and an expansion of the coordinator body. But these demonstrations are untenable with what the numbers have to say: very little has changed in the prevalence of on-campus assault and the infrequency of reporting. These two metrics are equally concerning because they are inextricably intertwined in affirming a permissive culture that translates to perceived immunity for perpetrators.
Over the first few weeks of first year orientation, we were introduced to Title IX, safety trainings, and an alcohol awareness module. We ran over the ideas of consent and substance use, and were handed a list of emergency contacts. What I was really looking for in these modules, though, was more than knowing to space out my drinks or go to parties in groups. These measures may be essential, but they’re largely preventive. As women, we needed to make sure we never drank too much and always had a ride back home, because the threats of assault were treated as constants; they would simply continue to exist, and we’d have to work our way around them.
In contrast, we were told nothing about the repercussions for perpetrators, tangible actions guaranteed by the College if we came forward as victims, or the detailed reporting process a victim could expect to work through. Training modules tell us everything about intervention and avoidance, and nothing about consequence or institutional accountability. This approach promulgates a dangerous culture. As students enter our institution, they are told that their responsibility on campus is to protect themselves and those around them. While this responsibility matters, centering the discussion around it at the cost of other conversations glosses over the many members of the Harvard community that have perpetrated assault themselves, implying that these individuals are immune to consequence.
Coupled with the convolutions of reporting mechanisms, it comes as no surprise that some students lack confidence in the existing reporting procedures — and perhaps even fear it — while others assume immunity from consequence. In a report on sexual harassment at Harvard, an external review comittee found “widespread confusion about even the most fundamental aspects of the reporting system,” writing that, “Multiple individuals, for instance, did not know the difference between the Title IX Office and the ODR” — the Office for Dispute Resolution — “or the difference between a disclosure and a formal complaint.”
At its most twisted, this culture transforms into the College’s string of high-profile professors who have sexually harassed and assaulted their students for years with little more than a slap on the wrist. Domínguez. Fryer. Makadon. Bestor. Urton. Comaroff. Harvard has shown it does not protect its women — especially when the reputations of powerful men are at stake. Unsurprisingly, the student body has little faith left in the integrity of the University's investigative procedures.
As the average freshman, I know very little about my first point of contact when I feel unsafe, or what I should expect if I ever need to file a formal complaint. For an institution that aggressively solicits detailed course evaluations twice a semester, I shouldn’t need to defer to writing an op-ed to communicate that.
If Harvard is truly committed to addressing its climate of sexual harassment, measures need to move beyond online education modules and prevention training. Assault must be addressed at the heart of the institution’s culture: a restructuring of administrative priorities, a guarantee of action and protection for survivors that come forward, and an emphasis on institutional and individual accountability. As the administration acknowledges its problematic past and identifies where it fails its students, it needs to place more weight on the experiences of individuals most impacted by it.
It shouldn’t be easier to navigate the College’s sexual harassment policies as a perpetrator than as a survivor. I shouldn’t feel safer during my nightly unguarded CVS runs than I do on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No, Latinidad does not assume a Mexican nationality. No, it does not include Spain. And no, it does not make you not-white. It also does not mean you speak Spanish. Think of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights” and its cast, with its pale shades of brown and white people dancing to Afro-beats — not Latinidad.
The political identity has worn many hats throughout its history: Latin-American, Hispanic, Latino, Latinx, and most recently, Latine. We rally to change its name time after time, to rebrand ourselves to fit the politics of the current ruling ideology. But perhaps the time has come to retire Latinidad, for it is nothing but a facade meant to erase the Black, Indigenous, poor, and other oppressed peoples of Latin America beneath the crushing weight of its long, colonial structure.
The problem with Latinidad is not in its name, but in its function to reinforce a monolith of more than 660 million people into one identity, excluding — and killing, but more on that later on — those who do not fit its image. During the 2020 Presidential election, President Biden and his campaign made strong efforts to win over what has come to be known as the “Latino Vote” — quite literally the ballot of a person identifying as Latino. Humorously, they ran on promises of immigration reform, which included returning the caged children to their parents; Dreamers’ protection; and Latine Cabinet officials. However, Biden’s campaign was surprised when there was significant — or quite frankly, any — Latine support for Trump after his notorious xenophobic remarks. Biden and his team had assumed that all Latinos care about issues of immigration, poverty, and race. They had reached for a monolith too tall for even the presidency.
I had once held a similar notion of blanket Latine identity. I went to high school with a majority of Mexican students. Of course, we had many white Mexicans, but it was not until I got to Harvard that I saw the degree of whiteness that Latinos could reach. I met my first set of Argentines and Cubans with winter white skin, sky blue eyes, and sun blonde hair.
Mexican poet and Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz once famously said, “Mexicans are descended from the Aztecs, Peruvains from the Incas, and Argentinians from ships.” These are the general origin stories of three Latin American nations, the last alluding to the heavy European presence in Argentina, especially from Germany.
I am not saying that all Argentines and Cubans are white. I know they are not. However, for only up to 9 percent of Argentinians today to hold African ancestry, despite the country importing about half as many enslaved people as the U.S. did, is shocking. Harvard’s Cubans shocked me because the only Cuban I “knew” all of my life was Black — Celia Cruz. It was upon meeting Harvard’s Argentines and Cubans that I learned of the thousands of Nazis that fled to Argentina and of the wealthy, landowning, majority-white Cubans that fled from communism to areas like Miami. Mexico, too, has ongoing violence against its Black and Indigienous populations, the majority of whom live in poverty.
Latinidad, rather than representing all the peoples it is meant to, assumes one experience from the white, Spanish-speaking, and Catholic-Christian people from Latin American nations, actively erasing and killing its Black, Indigenous, and poor people. Latinidad, in this violent, colonial form, must end.
I championed Latinidad growing up, raised on myths of our ability to work hard and committed to represent the richness of Mexico. But when I set foot at this school, the monolith began to crumble. Latinidad has written its own undoing. It cannot synthesize all the people of Latin America into one identity. Yes, we can just begin using Latinidad to mean from a Latin American country, but what then? Will systemic racism and ethnic and racial cleansing cease in these countries? Will the material conditions of its Black, Indigneous, and poor people better and allow them joy and life?
At Harvard, there are multiple Latine clubs. Yet these clubs have visibly subpar membership from Brown Latines, let alone the negligible amount from Black Latines. In fact, some of these clubs are led by white Latines. There may even be a Spanish student in the Harvard Organization of Latin America, despite Spain being a European country. Latinidad at Harvard is nothing more than a lie.
The lies of Latinidad go far back, surround us, and cut deep. They kill. To not question Latinidad, even with the hope to better it, if not end it, is to perpetuate its colonial violence. Let us retire the term for the time being while it is questioned and speak on subjects with specificity. Before we can address issues faced disproportionately by Black, Indigenous, and poor people in Latin American countries, the colonial tower of Latinidad must be toppled.

Have you ever noticed the way birthday candles melt? A carnival-colored cascade, dripping bright pinks and yellows, melting too quick for comfort. For Claudia Cabral, that fast melt marked the time to slow down. Not that she had a choice — her 20th birthday fell on the same day she was sent home at the outbreak of the pandemic. It would have been her last birthday at MIT. And it would have been the last one regardless — one semester later, Claudia would be accepted as a transfer student to Harvard.
School had always been immensely important to Claudia. She is the first in her family to graduate from high school — let alone college. It wasn’t until her success at an extremely STEM-focused South Florida high school that she found the courage to apply to an elite college. After discovering her first academic encouragement among pendulums and protractors, she was drawn to more of the same. She came to see that her science and math mind was what would open doors for her, to the point where she convinced herself that she liked science and math. Claudia describes the pressure of being a First-Generation college student as the feeling of being a racehorse with blinders on. It’s a fear-fueled focus. One that screams that if you drop the ball just once, even a little, you could lose everything you’ve worked for. It’s only natural, then, that Claudia took her technical talents and ran with them all the way to one of the top biomedical engineering programs in the country — if not the world.
On the surface, Claudia thrived there, joining many clubs and diving into her classes. But in reality, she joined club after club and tried class after class just to try to find one that she felt genuinely drawn to — to no avail. But it was while trying class after class that Claudia realized what truly captivated her. After cross-registering for an introductory sociology class at Harvard, she was so excited by the non-STEM material that she glowed when she talked about it. When her family visited Boston one weekend of her sophomore year, they noticed her newfound excitement around school. That’s when the thought flashed across her mind: What if Harvard?
By the time the Common App transfer application opened in November, Claudia knew she was going to give it her all. On her long walks to classes, she turned it over and over in her mind. She would take notes constantly, giving ink to any useful thought that struck her, filling up notebook pages with what she affectionately deemed as “brain dumping.” After countless hours spent in front of her essays, she turned in her application in early March, the week before she had to leave campus for the pandemic.
Then, three months into the pandemic, that brain dumping ended up being quite valuable – against the 1 percent admission rate’s odds, Claudia was accepted as a transfer to Harvard. She was overjoyed, even while it would be almost a year before she could set foot on Harvard’s campus. During that time, she realized that it was time to set her course. She drew on support from her family to combat burnout – the burnout unique to years of hard work on something that isn’t the right fit for you. Laughing alongside her siblings over snacks between classes, Claudia learned to lean into what interested her.
She gave herself the space to enjoy the humanities and the social sciences that lit a fire in her mind, even if it wasn’t what she had been encouraged for all her academic life. Her life in the biomedical engineering environment had felt too constricting, too fast, like candles poised to smother a birthday cake in wax. A forced slow-down was just what her motivation needed. Coming from a First-Generation background, Claudia had always felt a few steps behind in internship and research experience. She used this new time to hone new skills that she had never had the chance to work on before. And while she did, she found a creativity and a playfulness that had always lived within her.
Nothing takes more courage than recognizing the dream you’ve worked for your whole life might not be the right fit — and doing something about it. Claudia manifested that courage to try new ways of expressing herself at Harvard, where she’s part of the ballroom dance team and the meditation club. She’s a member of the coveted public speaking class, Expos 40. She studies sociology, different from biomedical engineering but equally human-centric, and thus captivating to Claudia.
She learned the value of being courageous not just in standing up for others, but in standing up for herself when her path was not right. Three semesters away from in-person school, and now a different school altogether, helped Claudia see that college was not forever. That she had achieved her dream of college by any standards. And that now, life was not only about surviving, but about flourishing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Culinary author and historian Michael W. Twitty delivered a lecture on African and African American food history at a virtual event hosted by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Thursday.
The lecture, entitled “Feeding the Nation,” addressed the legacy of enslaved Africans and African Americans in American food culture. Dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute Tomiko Brown-Nagin later joined in conversation with Twitty and fielded audience questions.
Twitty began the discussion by addressing a central misconception of African American culinary culture.
“We have another sort of fake lore, which is, Black people's food traditions come from their lack of ownership, their lack of agency, their lack of willpower,” Twitty said. “All of that is completely not true.”
Rather, Twitty explained, enslaved African Americans in the American South replicated food traditions and staple recipes from their homelands. Twitty cited the example of dried okra, a recipe that was popular among enslaved Africans in the South but originated in West Africa.
Twitty discussed the tendency for society to construct narratives that misrepresent African American culinary history.
“When I do my work of reconstructing and piecing back together this narrative, I found that there were so many elements that were just totally overlooked because we were so interested in attaching the narrative of how enslaved people ate, cooked, lived to a trauma narrative,” Twitty said.
Twitty also commented on the importance of his research and the obstacles that he faces as a food historian.
“As a Black person who has taken on this work for his life, to talk about our ancestors — and these are not just specimens, these are not just subjects, these are our ancestors — I know that I have to be twice as good at it to be just as good,” he said.
Twitty highlighted the need for “culinary justice” due to the “theft, erasure, and denial” that Black chefs and cooks have historically experienced.
“Our culture and our culinary tradition is at stake here,” he said.
Twitty noted that a major part of culinary justice involves properly crediting Black chefs and cooks and challenging those who have “the power, the platform, and the privilege to take [their] culture.”
He called on individuals to help document local Black food institutions, which can be forgotten through processes like gentrification and redlining.
“We really do need people to go into their family scrapbooks, find menus, find matchbooks,” Twitty said. “So we can begin to document that part of Black food history in America.”
Concluding his lecture, Twitty reiterated the significance of reclaiming and remembering African American cultural narratives.
“There is something beautiful and sustainable and spiritually purified about understanding that the culture did not die with us,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When longtime Harvard University Police Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley retired in 2020, he left behind a department roiled by allegations of racism, sexism, and favoritism — part of a toxic work environment some current and former officers alleged he created.
Now, two years after Riley’s departure, with a new police chief in place, just three members of his senior leadership team remain on the department’s command staff.
Since Victor A. Clay took over as HUPD’s new chief in July, the department’s leadership has undergone a series of sweeping changes. Of the seven senior staff members at the time of Clay's arrival, four have been reassigned to other divisions or left the school entirely, according to archives of the department’s website. Three new members have since been promoted to the senior leadership team, which has been restructured to include one fewer member and renamed to command staff.
HUPD’s longtime deputy chief, Kevin W. Regan, who was second-in-command for years under Riley, left the department in February. Scott Simas, Robert Harrington, and Wilmon D. Chipman — formerly members of the senior staff team — were reassigned to serve as the department's watch commanders.
Two new senior roles — assistant chief and captain — were established in December, according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
“Since his arrival at the Harvard University Police Department, Chief Clay has prioritized an analysis and consideration of the structure of the Department and its leadership to address organizational needs and to increase operational effectiveness,” Catalano wrote on Thursday.
“These internal changes are a part of Chief Clay’s ongoing efforts to meet Department, community and University priorities related to the role of public safety on campus, as well as to ensure both internal and external accountability,” he added.
Following Riley’s departure, Regan stayed on as deputy chief under Denis Downing, who served as the department’s interim leader. After Clay was appointed, Downing and Regan served as deputy chiefs, but in December, the roles were replaced with an assistant chief position that is now held solely by Downing.
Regan — who began at HUPD in 1998, according to his LinkedIn, two years after Riley — has since joined the Boston office of the Burger Law Group. In a March 10 Facebook post, the law firm wrote that Regan recently retired from HUPD, which Catalano confirmed.
Regan did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Regan joined HUPD after a stint with the Massachusetts State Police, where Riley also worked before coming to Harvard.
In 2009, Harvard auditors launched an investigation into allegations that Regan and Riley misused their University-issued gas cards and vehicles. Regan allegedly drove his take-home HUPD sport utility vehicle to South Dakota for a 2007 motorcycle rally, paying for the trip with his University gas card, according to a 2009 Boston Globe story. Riley was accused of using his Harvard car and card for weekend trips to Vermont.
Another member of Riley’s inner circle, Charles P. Hanson, also departed HUPD following Clay’s arrival. Hanson — a sergeant in the department's administrative division — was a member of the motorcycle club the “Road Dawgs,” which is made up of current and former law enforcement officials, alongside Regan.
Hanson negligently fired his weapon in 2018 at a simulation room where officers are not allowed to use real firearms, according to an internal incident report uncovered by a 2020 investigation by The Crimson. The gunshot caused hearing damage to another officer, Corina F. Maher, who was terminated while on medical leave. Hanson remained with the department until 2021.
Hanson did not respond to a request for comment.
Correction: March 26, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the “Road Dawgs” is the Harvard University Police Department’s motorcycle club. In fact, the club is made up of current and former law enforcement officials with various affiliations, not just HUPD.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro discussed the future of the progressive movement in the Democratic Party Thursday evening at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum moderated by Maya Rupert, Castro’s former campaign manager and an IOP spring resident fellow.
Castro, who served as mayor of San Antonio for five years, ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2020. He announced that he intends to return to politics and said he believes U.S. Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could lose if he runs for reelection in 2024.
“I think I’ll jump back into public service at some point,” Castro said. “I haven't made a decision about ’24 or beyond that, but I do think that Cruz is very vulnerable.”
Castro will join the faculty of Harvard Law School for the fall semester where he will teach a course about post-pandemic city leadership, according to a press release Monday.
He also said he believes Texas can become a Democratic state over the next few years, pointing to California as an example of a state that moved from red to blue.
“California was a reliably Republican state for the longest time,” he said. “This is the state that produced Nixon, produced Reagan, produced governors like Deukmejian, Pete Wilson in the 1990s.”
Texas shifted towards the Democratic party under former President Donald J. Trump and is continuing to trend in that direction as suburbs that were Republican strongholds become increasingly competitive, according to Castro.
“It was that Trump offended the sensibilities of a lot of the people in those suburbs,” Castro said. “These Republicans were saying ‘I didn’t change. I don’t see a place for myself in this party with all this craziness that the MAGA movement is all about.’”
Castro said he thinks Beto O’Rourke’s 2022 campaign for governor against Republican incumbent Greg Abbott is going to push Texas closer to the Democratic Party, even if O’Rourke fails to win in November.
“I think Beto’s race this year is going to help because he’s an indefatigable campaigner,” Castro said. “And even if people don’t agree with him, he’s a much more likable character than Greg Abbott, and I think he is going to help move the ball forward.”
“He could win too because Abbott has messed up so much,” Castro added.
Castro also explained what he believes the Democratic Party must do if it wants to energize its progressive members.
“I think the Democratic Party needs to produce results on some of these issues that strike at the heart of a lot of what progressives want,” he said. “Everybody wants better investment in education, better results on Covid, more job creation.”
But he argued Democrats need to go further by canceling student loans and raising the minimum wage.
Castro warned Democrats can impede their own agenda by worrying whether their policies might cost the party the support of independent voters.
“I think we get into this quandary of thinking ‘Oh, well, if we do this, this is going to submarine us with the general population or the swing voters' and Democrats don’t end up being as bold in their pursuit of their policy goals as Republicans sometimes are,” he said.
Castro added, however, that the current Republican Party does not currently have an articulated agenda and has become “a cult of Trump.”
“I think that the Republican Party is totally unanchored now to real policy goals,” he said. “If Ronald Reagan came alive right now and he saw the way that Tucker Carlson and others are talking about Russia, it would be completely unrecognizable.”
“I don’t think they stand for much anymore,” Castro said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a spike in Covid-19 cases earlier this month, many Harvard instructors have opted to continue requiring masks in classrooms, even after the University lifted its mask mandate for most indoor spaces last week.
As of March 14, instructors may choose whether or not to require students to mask in their classrooms. Many professors are mandating masks for the first week after spring break to wait out a potential spike. Some have taken a stricter approach, requiring masks for the rest of the semester, while others have gone fully mask-optional.
Students in classes larger than 250 people are still required to wear masks, but instructors may teach unmasked in classes of all sizes.
Harvard saw a surge of Covid-19 cases among undergraduates just before it lifted its mask requirement this month, with 765 undergraduates testing positive in the four weeks prior to spring break, according to Harvard’s Covid-19 testing dashboard.
More than 75 Harvard affiliates, mostly graduate students and staff, signed onto a petition created this month calling on Harvard to reinstate its mask mandate. The open letter said the current mask-optional policy “puts the onus of protection on those who are most vulnerable.”
In an email announcing the changes to masking policies, Harvard administrators wrote the school may return to mandating indoor masking if health risks increase.
“The University and its advisers will continue to monitor indicators of pandemic activity regionally and within our community, placing particular weight on severity of illness and hospitalization rates,” administrators wrote on March 7.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences recommended that instructors consult Harvard’s testing dashboard to assess the risks that teaching a large number of students would pose as they consider their individual classroom protocol.
Students in Life Sciences 1b: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution,” must wear masks during lecture due to the course's size, which exceeds 250 students.
For lab sections this week, instructors asked students to wear masks since many traveled over spring break, according to Biology professor Hopi E. Hoekstra, an instructor for the course.
Hoekstra wrote in an email that instructors will reassess at the end of this week and may allow individual teaching staff to decide whether to continue the mask mandate for lab sections.
Philosophy lecturer Seth Robertson also asked his students to keep their masks on this week but said he will reevaluate based on case counts.
Even though unmasking helps instructors to gauge their students’ reactions, Robertson said “the health and safety of the students has to come first.”
Some faculty chose to mandate masks indefinitely. Adam R. Singerman ’09, a lecturer in Linguistics, said he decided to continue requiring masks for Linguistics 117R: “Linguistic Field Methods,” a class with under 15 students.
“I told the class I’d like everyone to continue to mask after break because the room is small and we’re in there for two hours, and I don’t want anyone to feel unsafe,” he said. “It’s not the kind of class you can Zoom in for — you have to be there and participate in person.”
Other faculty decided to go mask-optional immediately upon returning from spring break.
Government and African and African American Studies professor Jennifer L. Hochschild said she will allow students and teaching fellows to decide whether to wear a mask.
“I just find it a lot easier to teach just because I’m talking a lot, but it isn’t anything about whether I’m taking any strong stance,” she said. “If any of my students suggested, or anybody else suggested, that they would prefer that I wear a mask, I would say, ‘sure.’”
Sarah J. Hummel, a visiting assistant professor in Government, said the option to unmask leaves instructors with a difficult decision, but they aim to promote the “best interest of our students.”
“It’s really hard for professors to make the decision to keep our students masked knowing that a lot of students won’t like that, but also to unmask them knowing that that might increase risks,” she said. “It’s a complicated issue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 25, 2022 at 6:38 a.m.
An audit of the Undergraduate Council’s finances has “yet to find evidence of any financial irregularities,” according to an initial report of its findings released Thursday by Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 and Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24.
The audit, which began in January and was conducted by Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services, dispelled some allegations of financial mismanagement that have plagued the Council since a particularly contentious presidential election last November. It also made recommendations on procedural changes for the body.
The Council voted unanimously to “fully cooperate” with the investigation last December. The audit was expected to conclude by the end of February, but was extended several times “in part because of refusals to answer questions,” Cheng wrote in his email.
The Dean of Students Office, which disperses funding to the UC, had withheld more than $125,000 from the body in response to the audit.
Throughout his Thursday email, Cheng asserted multiple times that the audit had uncovered “extensive financial mismanagement in the UC,” and that some more serious findings had been withheld from the report due to concerns over optics.
“Some of the findings of the investigation will not be released publicly because they could cause substantial harm to Harvard’s reputation, given that the UC nominally represents Harvard students to the public,” Cheng wrote in the email.
Assistant Dean of Student Engagement and Leadership Kate Colleran, who previously served as a mediator for the UC, had a different evaluation of the report.
In an email to The Crimson, Colleran asserted that the report represented the full scope of the investigation.
“I was pleased that the UC recognized a need to hold themselves accountable in their stewardship of student money by requesting an audit,” Colleran wrote. “I have confirmed with Audit Services that all of their findings are included in the report and no financial irregularities were found.”
Cheng later clarified his statements in an interview.
“I think being yet to find evidence does not mean that the UC is completely cleared,” Cheng said. “Strictly looking at legal terms, yeah, there are no legal financial irregularities, but there is definitive financial mismanagement.”
The report makes conclusions about the merits of six of 12 financial allegations against the body.
In one finding, investigators determined that a student organization received $2,190 of funding from the Grant for an Open Harvard College in November 2020 to purchase Patagonia sweaters. The report indicated that the apparel “does not align” with the grant criteria.
The grant money is to be awarded to initiatives that are “socially inclusive and financially accessible,” including racial, cultural, mental health, and harassment prevention causes, per the UC’s website.
The report also stated that a UC retreat to Sunapee, N.H., in the fall of 2021 had exceeded its $3,000 allocated budget by nearly $4,000. No formal budget for the trip was available, the report also noted.
The report evaluated the legitimacy of several claims made during the UC’s officer elections last November, including allegations levied against former Adams House Representative Esther J. Xiang ’23, who was accused of losing or stealing at least $20,000 of Covid-19 relief funding granted by the Council.
“We found no evidence that any funds were disbursed, used for other purposes, or otherwise spent improperly by presidential candidate Esther Xiang,” the report states.
Xiang and her running mate, David Y. Zhang ’23, were runners-up in the election among six tickets.
In a written statement to The Crimson Thursday, Xiang underscored the distress the episode had caused her and advocated for compassion and kindness from her peers.
“These were severe accusations, and their insidious intent and destructive power cannot be understated. They affected my relationships, had people questioning my character, and took a deep toll on my mental health and wellbeing,” Xiang wrote. “I hope that this audit brings us clarity, not just about my situation, but about how the UC, its campaigns, and all members of the Harvard community should hold themselves more accountable for their actions.”
Cheng addressed the findings in his email.
“No one deserves to have their reputation destroyed by false, misleading allegations,” he wrote.
The report also cleared the Council of tax code violations that were the focus of attacks by Ivor K. Zimmerman ’24 during his bid for UC president in the same election.
Zimmerman and his running mate, Joy Y. Lin ’23, campaigned largely on the premise that the UC had violated its own constitution by failing to file for non-profit status since 2008, and that the body was therefore nonexistent.
Then-UC President Noah A. Harris ’22 defended the council against the accusation, clarifying that the Council was automatically granted non-profit status on account of its standing as a Harvard student organization. The UC later voted to remove this constitutional requirement.
The report echoed Harris’ explanation.
“The UC is not required to file income tax returns since it is sponsored by the DSO and qualifies under the University’s tax-exempt status,” it reads.
Zimmerman reacted to the findings with relief and some humor.
“I don't want to say I'm disappointed because it's a good thing, but obviously, womp womp, ran a campaign on saying it wasn't real,” he said.
The report states that, in two of the 12 allegations investigated, auditors could not make conclusions “based on the unavailability of financial records or inconclusive data.” These allegations included the “failure to collect and review $100,000 of grant receipts and request return of unspent funds during 2017 and 2018” and the use of UC debit cards for meals and snacks.
Four other allegations remain pending including favoritism shown toward large student organizations, conflicts of interest in Wintersession grants, political contributions made by the Council, and “misuse of grant funds by a student organization focused on cultural and racial initiatives.”
The report also presented a range of procedural recommendations to improve the UC’s financial management practices, including regular review of UC debit card activity, more thorough financial training for officers, and the documentation of conflict of interest procedures.
UC Treasurer Kimani E. Panthier ’24 expressed satisfaction with the results of the audit and underscored his commitment to improving the UC’s financial management infrastructure.
“My reaction to the audit is that the audit confirms what I knew all along, that there were no financial irregularities,” Panthier said. “I think that these findings demonstrate that we can even further enhance the fiscal responsibility of the UC with the help of the professionals from the independent audit.”
The report states that the investigators are “working with UC officers to resolve” the pending allegations and expect “to reach a conclusion in the next few days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s Disability Law Student Association filed an open letter earlier this month asking administrators to refrain from ending the Law School’s mask mandate.
The Law School made face coverings optional after students returned from spring break on the heels of the University’s announcement that it would lift its indoor mask mandate on March 14.
In the DLSA’s March 8 letter, students requested that HLS administrators establish an anonymous process for students to request medical accommodations from professors as well as loosen the class recording policy.
The letter has not been sent directly to administrators, but has been shared with student groups and published in the Harvard Law Record.
In the letter, DLSA leaders expressed concerns over the timing of the mask mandate lift. DLSA officer Marty Strauss said in an interview with The Crimson that the Law School’s decision left many immunocompromised students feeling vulnerable and worried.
“Especially changing the policy in the middle of the semester is particularly unfair to people who are immunocompromised,” Strauss said. “They will have difficult choices to make at this point.”
In addition to the timing dispute, Linh Tang, a first-year law student, mentioned she found no reference to the considerations of disabled students in any communication about lifting the mask mandate from HLS officials.
“There was a last minute one-liner saying that if you want to keep your mask on, feel free to do so,” Tang said. “There wasn't enough of a window for people to voice their opinion.”
Law School Dean for Administration L. Tracee Whitley ’88 wrote in a March 7 email to HLS affiliates that individuals can "freely exercise the personal choice" to continue masking indoors.
"HLS leadership joins the University in supporting such personal health decisions by our community members, and asks that everyone support and respect any member of our community who wishes to continue taking advantage of the extra level of personal health protection offered by face coverings," Whitley wrote.
Tang also said that no students were consulted throughout the school’s decision making process.
“We don't know if there was even a poll for the faculty,” Tang said. “But as far as we know, nobody ever polled the student body to ask. It was a unilateral decision from the administration without a lot of consideration of student voices.”
Lucy Litt, the DLSA’s president, said this was not the first time disabled students have had trouble receiving accommodations from the Law School. Litt stressed that it was important for professors to make class recordings available so disabled students have the option of attending class asynchronously to reduce their exposure to the coronavirus.
“What I've heard the most is frustration with getting access to class recordings in particular,” Litt said. “We've had students who have sort of needed that all along or could have benefited from that all along. It's extremely difficult to get any kind of accommodation like that.”
In the past few days, as students have experienced campus life without masks, Litt added that members of the DLSA have raised new requests since publishing the open letter, such as creating a designated socially distanced eating area for immunocompromised students who wished to continue eating on campus.
“When this school originally went remote… they made recordings available,” Litt said. “I think people have just been frustrated that they might become invisible again once this whole thing stops affecting everybody else.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite engineering late comebacks and surprising upsets throughout its run to the NCAA tournament, the No.15 Harvard men’s ice hockey team’s season came to an end in the first round of the NCAA Tournament Regionals Thursday afternoon, as it was unable to erase a three-goal deficit in an eventual 4-3 loss to the No.1 Minnesota State Mavericks. The game was played at MVP Arena in Albany, N.Y.
“We've been in that situation a few times this year and been able to come back completely. So I definitely had confidence there and it just shows the resilience of this group that we've had here,” said senior forward and captain Casey Dornbach.
In the first period, the Mavericks dominated possession, outshooting the Crimson 19-6. However, Harvard stood strong in its defensive zone, led by junior goalkeeper Mitchell Gibson’s 17 saves, as well as a strong performance by the team’s top defense pairing of junior Henry Thrun and first-year Ian Moore.
However, with just under six minutes remaining in the period, Minnesota State opened the scoring. With Gibson out of position and screened after a chaotic netfront scramble, forward Connor Gregga tipped in defenseman Akito Hirose’s rocket from the point, giving the Mavericks the 1-0 lead.
About three minutes later, the Crimson were whistled for having too many players on the ice, taking a minor penalty and sending the Mavericks to the power play. They capitalized on this advantage, as Hirose’s slick shot fake from the point created time and space for forward Reggie Lutz, who wired the puck into the open net for the 2-0 lead. In the final two minutes of the period, tensions continued to rise, as Minnesota State defenseman Benton Maas was sent to the box for tripping with 39 seconds to go, allowing Harvard to start the second period a man up.
Ultimately, the Crimson was unable to execute on the one minute, 21 seconds of the remaining power play it had at the beginning of the second period. It soon found itself down by three goals just over two minutes in, as an unassisted ripper by Mavericks forward Brendan Furry from the top of the slot extended the Minnesota State lead to 3-0.
“They were a great team and they played well, but I think we didn't play our best and gave them a few,” Dornbach said. “I think that just shows where our hockey is going to be able to compete with the best teams in the country.”
After the third goal, Minnesota State kept an aggressive pace of attack. Just past the halfway mark of the period, in a desperate attempt to prevent a goal, Harvard senior defenseman Marshall Rifai illegally passed the puck with his hand in the crease, a violation that granted the Mavericks a penalty shot. Forward Julian Napravnik took the one-on-one against Gibson, but was denied. Gibson’s effort was the first penalty shot save for Harvard since February 27th, 2016.
This stop seemed to shift the momentum in favor of the Crimson. After killing a penalty assessed to Rifai for roughing, Harvard’s offense became more aggressive, as the Crimson began to control possession. With just over three minutes to play in the second, a shot by sophomore forward Sean Farrell from below the goal line deflected off of a defender and past Mavericks goaltender Dryden McKay, making it a 3-1 game.
Just 48 seconds later, first-year forward Alex Gaffney cut the lead in half, controlling possession off of an offensive zone entry and driving hard to the net. Gaffney’s maneuvers lured McKay across the crease, creating space for a neat finish to send Harvard to the dressing room only down 3-2.
Entering the third period just one shot away from erasing the early three-goal deficit, Harvard carried its late second period momentum into its play to start the third. The Crimson generated offense on two consecutive shifts to start the period before junior forward and captain Nick Abruzzese had a golden opportunity at the front of the net denied by McKay’s left pad. The Mavericks quickly countered the other way, with leading scorer Nathan Smith creating a partial breakaway that Gibson shut down.
Minutes later, after Harvard maintained possession in the Minnesota State zone for an extended period, the Mavericks were able to chip the puck out of the zone past the group of Crimson players stationed along the boards, creating an odd-man break for the Mavericks. Off the rush, forward Ondrej Pavel’s missile of a wrist shot beat Gibson over his glove, extending the Minnesota State lead to 4-2 with 14 minutes to play.
Both teams clamped down on the defensive end after Pavel’s goal, as the Mavericks consistently prevented Harvard from generating clean offensive zone entries, extended offensive zone pressure, or high danger scoring chances. However, with just over five minutes to play, Smith was sent to the box for tripping first-year forward Matthew Coronato, giving the Crimson a power play and a chance to stay alive.
Although Harvard’s first power play unit was ineffective at creating offense, the Crimson came to life with the second unit on the ice. With Gibson on the bench to create a six-on-four advantage, Farrell fired a cross-ice pass from the right circle to Dornbach on the left wing, who attempted to find junior forward John Farinacci at the net. However, Dornbach’s pass deflected off a Mavericks defenseman and past McKay, cutting the deficit to 4-3 with three and a half minutes to play.
With the opportunity to orchestrate yet another late game comeback to keep its season alive, Harvard had several dangerous chances in the final minutes of the game. Sophomore forward Alex Laferriere had two slap shot opportunities from the top of the slot, but he was twice blocked by the Mavericks’ David Silye. Coronato also had two chances at an open net, once on a one-timer and another time on a backhand off a rebound, but he couldn’t get enough on the shot to beat McKay. With time ticking down, Minnesota State pinned the puck in the corner, preventing any further Crimson chances and eliminating Harvard from the NCAA tournament.
“They were doing a good job of getting in lanes,” Abruzzese said. “They didn’t make it easy on us all night and the last 20 seconds was kind of a microcosm of that.”
Despite the disappointing finish to the Crimson’s season, Dornbach expressed pride at the team’s accomplishments, which include an Ivy League title and an ECAC Championship, and his optimism for the future.
“We had a lot to be proud of in this room, in this group, for how young we were and how many people probably wrote us off because of that,” Dornbach said. “It shows a lot where this program is going, and the talent that we have…a lot of great players on this team. So excited to see what they could do in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The men’s lacrosse team (5-1, 1-0 Ivy League) blew past its third-straight ranked opponent in no. 12 Boston University on Tuesday. The Crimson played a cohesive game that helped propel itself to victory over its undefeated Boston rival.
Face off play by senior fogo Steven Cuccurullo (14 for 21 on the day), and wings first-year Martin Nelson, who battled to scoop up 7 ground balls, and sophomore Greg Campisi showed great improvement from the team’s previous showings against Brown and Michigan. The unit went 15 for 25, a much better stat than its 4 for 26 against Brown. Harvard was able to turn many of the takes into either three-on-three or three-on-two scrums if it was unsuccessful in winning the initial clamp, which allowed it to take advantage of more offensive possession time.
“Martin Nelson and Greg Campisi are two great athletes, and two great ground ball guys. They are all to credit. They are able to dominate. They really listened to the game plan well” complimented Cuccurullo.
First-year attackman Sam King was a standout on the offensive line, as he often had his defender hung up in front of the cage which allowed him to attack up the GLE (goal line extended) as well as facilitate movement with feeds from behind. King tallied four goals on the day. The other two guys on the line, senior Austin Madronic and junior Hayden Cheek, both played well. Madronic had three goals and two assists on the day, and Cheek boasted two goals.
“It was offensively good, a team effort – guys putting themselves in good places and being unselfish,” King said. “We need to work on making the smart decisions at all points of the game and just cleaning up some of the stick skills. Overall it was a good win, we gritted it out.”
King was complimentary of the defense, which locked down on its sets and communicated through picks and switches well. First-year defenders Tommy Martinson and Collin Bergstrom were standouts throughout the game and forced Michigan to spread its plays.
“I thought that we played well defensively. They were a good inside team. We missed some slides that led to some goals,” King said. “I thought we guarded well … close defense and our guys didn’t get beat off the dribble too much, but we did get beat inside. There are things to work on before the next game.”
Middies stood out on both ends of the field with junior Nick Loring and first-years Miles Botkiss, Owen Gaffney and Andrew Perry all notching a goal. Loring also boasted two assists for a combined three points on the day. Botkiss made a heads up play sinking a shot from midfield on an open net with BU’s goalie out for the 10 man ride.
The 10 man ride is when a team sends its goalie out of the cage to defend the clear. It can be effective in slowing down and stopping the ball from crossing the fifty in the twenty seconds allotted to the offending team, but is incredibly high risk as it leaves the goal unattended. Harvard did a good job handling this pressure for the most part and was able to successfully clear the ball for the majority of its possessions. When asked, Perry said that the team practiced breaking this zone, but that they will look to be more poised when playing against it in the future. Future opponent and rival Yale employs this zone for much of its ride, so it will be important for the team to feel confident against this style of play..
“We needed to settle down and stay patient,” Perry said. “The first few possessions we rushed it and didn’t really get into our offense, but then once we got into our six-v-six and ran our stuff, and didn’t let them dictate the game, it started to work better for us.”
On the other side of the ball, first-year Ray Dearth, junior Chase Yager, and junior Bryn Evans did well flying in on the fast breaks, fronting their cutters, and were able to clear upfield with time to allow the offense to get in its sets. They made heads up slides and forced BU to stretch its field for outside shots, which caused their offense to make extra passes that resulted in sloppy play that Harvard capitalized on by fighting for ground balls.
Senior goalie Kyle Mullin was on fire in cage. He made 12 solid saves, stuffing countless BU attempts on the doorstep. His clearing was also impressive as he helped the defense break BU’s ride.
The team will look to clean up its play a little bit before its game against Dartmouth on Saturday. The man up unit went 0-2 on the day, and junior attackman Hayden Cheek commented after the victory against Brown last week that special teams was an aspect the squad was looking to improve on, so they should be looking to continue improving on that.
The team is excited for more league play to get underway.
“Obviously our goal is to win this game, and to win an Ivy League title, and that starts with this next game. I’m super excited to play them, they are … really good this year,” Cuccurullo said.
The Crimson will host The Big Green on Jordan Field at 4pm on Saturday, March 26th for its second game of Ivy League play.

“Belfast”
Kenneth Branagh tells the story of his childhood in Northern Ireland during The Troubles conflict in the late 1960s. This movie has achieved the impossible, from making Fifty Shades’s Jamie Dornan into a respectable actor to giving perhaps the sweetest message about moving past ethnic conflict that cinema has seen in a while. As one of the shortest movies on this list, you can definitely squeeze in watching it between lecture and lab.
“CODA”
Standing for Child of Deaf Adults, this nominee (and my predicted winner) is also the most Harvard-centric: main character and Massachusetts native Ruby dreams of attending Berklee (shout-out to our artists who are also enrolled here) but is worried about the impact this will have on her deaf family, who she has interpreted for her entire life. A remake of the French “La Famille Bélier,” watch out for this film in the Best Supporting Actor (the phenomenal Troy Kotsur is the first deaf male acting Oscar nominee) and maybe even Adapted Screenplay categories. If you choose to watch this movie, grab a lot of tissues and open up Spotify because speaking from experience, you’ll be listening to the soundtrack for weeks while studying in Widener.
“Don’t Look Up”
One of the more well-known Netflix nominees going into Oscar night, this is also one of the most polarizing. Telling the story of a large asteroid on its way to hit Earth and astronomers’ attempt to get the government to care, “Don’t Look Up” has been criticized for its similarity to an SNL skit and its lack of subtlety. On the other hand, it says what needs to be said: climate change is going to destroy us, and Ariana Grande has a beautiful voice. With an all-star cast including Jennifer Lawrence in her return to the big screen, “Don’t Look Up” is at the very least, incredibly interesting, which can’t be said about a lot of films that have been nominated for Best Picture before.
“Drive My Car”
Looking to impress your East Asian Cinema TF? Daydreaming about going to Japan? Look no further. “Drive My Car” is everything a movie should be. Following a theater director whose life is turned upside-down when he discovers that his wife is cheating on him — only for her to die soon after — Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s meditation on grief hits you harder than your professors assigning homework, papers, and labs right before spring break. Support the Oscars’ shift toward being less America-centric by watching this film, a likely winner in the Best International Feature category and nominee for Best Director.
“Dune”
This is just one of the movies featuring Timothée Chalamet nominated this year. I watched it, and still can’t really tell you what happened. But this sci-fi epic is the likely-winner of nearly all technical awards. Seriously, it looks stunning, and I’m not just saying that because Zendaya is in it. With a story about warring groups and a powerful substance that permits travel faster than the speed of light, impress your history professors by pointing out how this film and the novel it is based on are allegories for the Cold War. If that’s not enough to convince you to watch “Dune,” I will repeat: Zendaya.
“King Richard”
“King Richard” doubles as this Oscar season’s fan-favorite biopic and random sports movie thrown into the list of nominees to attract the athlete crowd. Featuring likely-Best-Actor-winner Will Smith as their father, the titular Richard, the movie focuses on his sacrifices and work spent training tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams (who happen to be executive producers) from a young age, as well as the beginning of their rise to fame. Plus, Beyoncé’s featured song is nominated for Best Original Song for this movie (another performance to look forward to). Honestly, having Beyoncé write a song for your movie is the best award out there.
“Licorice Pizza”
Disclaimer: this movie is about the romantic relationship between a fifteen-year-old child actor and a twenty-five-year-old woman who is looking to use his connections to become famous. It also features some extremely racist comments from a white man pretending to speak English with a Japanese accent. I sincerely hope this movie doesn’t walk away with the Best Original Screenplay award it is favored for. On a lighter note though, I think we can expect to be seeing more of the wonderful Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman in the future.
“Nightmare Alley”
Extremely gritty and drenched in moonlight, watching “Nightmare Alley” makes you wonder what illicit substances the makers of this movie were on. Despite not being as well-received as some of the movies it beat out for its slot as a Best Picture nominee (I’m looking at you “tick, tick…BOOM!”), Guillermo del Toro’s story about a circus performer who suddenly figures out how to make a ton of money as a mind reader is wild from start to finish.
“The Power of the Dog”
Once a predicted winner, Best Picture is no longer a sure thing for this movie, which is such a slow burn that the plot can’t be summarized without spoiling the ending. Let’s just say Benedong Cucumber stars as a cowboy who doesn’t like his new nephew-in-law. And then things get crazy. Set in beautiful New Zealand, Jane Campion is likely to become only the third female Best Director winner and would become the first woman to win it consecutively after another woman (Chloe Zhao won last year for Nomadland). So whether or not it wins Best Picture, there will be something to celebrate ;)
“West Side Story”
At this point, everybody knows the original West Side Story was racist. Steven Spielberg’s big solution to making his remake not racist? Casting Latinx actors in the roles of the Latinx characters. That’s literally it. The dialogue still ranges from obviously racist to (new! fresh! cool!) representing white colonizer narratives. Literally. The white Ansel Elgort (who, besides being horrible in this role, also plays a criminal) explains to a Puerto Rican character what something in Spanish means. Separately, he tells another Puerto Rican character that he needs to marry a Puerto Rican girl. Nice. Besides that, there is a transgender man featured prominently who is only properly gendered by the other characters when they want something from him. However, I must confess: the performances in this movie were (besides Elgort) phenomenal. Rachel Zegler as Maria is showstopping, and Ariana DeBose as Anita rightfully deserves the Best Supporting Actress trophy she is nominated for. Just. Please stop trying to fix West Side Story – it’s a lost cause.
Other Awards and Events of Note
Calling all “Twilight” fans: Kristen Stewart, up for her role as Lady Di in Spencer, is FINALLY receiving Academy recognition. Once the favorite for Best Actress, the race has been blown wide open, so definitely tune in to support our girl, now all grown up :’)
Billie Eilish and FINNEAS, the favorites for Best Original Song, will be performing “No Time to Die.” This girl is already more successful than I could ever dream of being, and I am here for it.
For the first time ever, there will be a new “Popular Film Award” that people have been able to vote for on Twitter. Maybe it’ll go to “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Maybe it’ll go to “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” or Camila Cabello’s “Cinderella.” Will the Academy embarrass itself? Rig the vote? Only time will tell.
Whether (or not!) you end up watching any of these films, I hope this list has given you somewhat of an idea of what will happen on Sunday. If not? Tune in next year for even more Academy shenanigans.
