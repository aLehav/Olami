After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I grew up along the border of Texas and Mexico, where two countries and a gulf meet. It’s the place where, 170 years ago, it was decided that my people couldn’t live in a shared land, and that being born a mile north of the Rio Grande River would give me a completely different life than a mile south of it.
Although being straddled on this artificial divide was one of the best things that could have happened to me, it has also been the cause of some of my greatest internal conflicts. Imagine going to school in Mexico and being told that the U.S. had stolen the land that is now California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. And then moving to the U.S. and being told that Mexico gave away its land willingly.
Who do you believe? Which narrative is the truth? Who’s the good guy and who’s the bad guy? As a 10-year-old whose mind was not mature enough to understand the politics behind this situation, it was shocking for me to be told that everything I had been taught in school was wrong and that the history of my heritage was not as I knew it. But thanks to this exposure, I learned a variety of perspectives that exist and the ways in which each education system and society shape our beliefs.
At times, I found it frustrating to not identify fully with one particular nation. I felt out of place and even lost. When I traveled across the U.S., I felt very Mexican, but while traveling around Mexico, I felt very American. My peers would laugh at me when my Mexican accent inevitably slipped as I tried to pronounce a long word. My mom would give me a concerned look when I would make up words in Spanish because I wasn’t sure of how to translate it from English in my mind. She looked at me with such disappointment that I was potentially forgetting my native tongue.
There was a point where I thought it’d be best to forget about one of them and immerse myself in the other to eventually fit in completely. It was simply too complicated to try to keep up with both languages and cultures and people, especially when others expected me to speak for both. But soon enough, I began to realize the beauty that came with belonging to two different cultures.
Just like I can enjoy authentic tacos and tamales or roll my r’s non-stop for minutes, I can also enjoy the academic opportunities available in the U.S. and be a part of a diverse community. By being fluent in both English and Spanish, I can have a conversation with more than two billion people in the world. Growing up in a Mexican household allows me to connect with the entire Latinx community and living in the U.S. grants me the opportunity to voice my opinions and have rights as well as responsibilities.
Although at times I can serve as a representation of both nations—and it brings me pride to share my experience in them—I can’t always speak for everyone in them. The fact that I am a lot more familiar with their culture and ways of living does not mean I know everything about them. Both of my countries are extraordinary in their diversity, and I will only be able to speak for myself. I stand at an intersection that is too complex to be compacted into a single story. Just like you can’t assume that every American’s experience is the same, you can’t assume that my experience as Mexican American will be the same as that of others. Instead of using me to speak for everyone and generalize, let my unique experience demonstrate that despite the borders and senseless restrictions that separate so many groups, there is tremendous beauty in sharing our stories and connecting with those around us and across oceans from us.
Don’t ask me which country I love more because I will never be able to answer that question. I have pride in both of the nations which have shaped who I am today, and even though both countries have made mistakes and I don’t always support them fully, I am grateful I can be a part of both communities and wouldn’t have it any other way. I no longer feel ashamed for not fully belonging anywhere. Instead, I celebrate the things that make me different than everyone else—whether that is in Mexico or the U.S.—and enjoy my time in my hometown of Brownsville, Texas, where people don’t expect me to choose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics—already under fire for the controversial appointment and removal of Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow—has again appeared in national headlines after hosting Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos last Thursday night. During DeVos’s speech, groups of students peacefully protested by standing and raising their fists inside the forum, among other acts.
We believe that regardless of one’s personal opinions on DeVos’s policy changes—including, perhaps most controversially, the removal of Obama-era Title IX guidelines and a proposal to use school vouchers—students have a right to use this forum as an opportunity to protest and express their political beliefs.
The IOP is built on the idea of empowering college students to become active participants in American political life and to take a stand for their values. The protesters that silently stood during DeVos’s speech quite clearly regarded her actions as incredibly destructive to themselves and their fellow students across the country. Indeed, they were practicing one of the IOP’s—and democracy’s—central tenets by peacefully advocating for what they believe to be right.
We thus are disappointed that the central narrative to emerge from these protests is the decision of many of the protesters to call DeVos a white supremacist. Multiple news outlets have fixated on this, condemning the overall protest as “disgusting” and “mindless”. These condemnations brush aside the broader conversation that should have taken place in light of the students’ protest.
We believe that fixating on specific signs or phrases used by individual protesters is a strawman tactic. It enables pundits to depict an entire protest as “unwarranted” rather than to explore the bigger picture. We must acknowledge this protest’s original purpose, and we encourage students to debate the actual policy measures which DeVos has implemented and which were protested in the forum.
Conversations about Title IX, charter schools, and racial equity in education are important, nuanced, and controversial. They are critical to the wellbeing of American students, determining their safety on college campuses, the quality of their education, and their access to resources. The Institute of Politics is the perfect forum for these debates and for students’ advocacy efforts, and we believe that holding DeVos—or any other political leader—accountable for her decisions is not only warranted, but also essential in a democratic society.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Support for Trump in communities formerly driven by the mining and manufacturing industries has clear origins. The near-elimination of these job markets has left many unemployed, without other practical skills or applicable experience. Trump’s frequent and direct addresses during his campaign solidified these communities’ indignation and prolonged their grieving—by promising the return of their jobs, he’s allowed them to ignore the harsh truth that their industries have irrevocably faded due to natural (and what should be welcome) progress. Caught in the cross-stitches of economic renewal and technological amelioration, these people have endured and continue to face job displacement and financial misfortune.
However, this popular narrative authored by Trump’s administration can only account for, at most, a couple hundred thousand of the almost 63 million people who voted for Trump. And while older upper-middle-class conservatives who typically vote red account for much of Trump’s constituency, many others who align with him unite under the guise that they are enduring severe economic hardship, like the miners and factory workers. And for many of these voters, particularly those in the Midwest, this is simply not true.
While massive disparities in economic health exist across the country, Midwestern states remain almost consistently among the most economically stable. A study led by the Director of Yale’s Institution for Social and Policy Studies highlighted that no Midwestern state was among the most economically volatile in the years following the 2008 recession. In fact, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Dakota were among the 10 states coping best with the national economic downturn. All of them voted for Trump. By contrast, the least economically stable states resided primarily in the South, which categorically, and unsurprisingly, voted Republican in 2016. In summary, despite uniting under a false commonality of financial difficulty, only some of the states that support Trump have really endured significant hardship.
As California houses the thriving conglomerate of the tech industry, and the Northeast continues to attract cultural innovation and financial power, the Midwest fails to feature a glamorous economic specialty. But the Midwest is not dying, at least according to the numbers. Compared to other regions in the U.S., the Midwest more than adequately subsists on its economic output. Yet Midwesterners still feel as though they lack something in comparison to the rest of the country, and perhaps rightly so. Midwestern states experience difficulty both retaining and attracting those with upper-level education and high-earning potential—college graduates are more likely to move to the coasts, or at least larger cities in the region, such as Chicago or St. Louis. The Midwest is remarkably inept at developing and attracting new and exciting opportunities that make people feel as though it’s flourishing.
Thus, the region has locked itself in a positive feedback loop consisting of both a lack of input and a lack of interest. Viewed by the rest of the country as an aged-but-revered preserve of old-timey America, the Midwest has often embraced this title, feeling comfortable resisting change as it revels in its isolation from the rest of the country. Still, with this pride comes sheepish insecurity and glaring consequences; feeling locked in a cultural standstill is a long brewing result of reluctance to integrate with a broader national culture of fast-moving innovation and risk-taking.
This leads us to believe that the “financial hardship” narrative is really just a way to hide, whether subconsciously or not, the real factors motivating much of Trump’s constituency—a cocktail of racism, misogyny, and xenophobia, coupled with a fear of change and the discontent that accompanies feeling two steps behind the rest of the country. His supporters’ urgency to move down Trump’s path of economic redemption successfully packages culturally-based anxieties into seemingly productive ends. His political promises, such as the wall between the U.S.-Mexican border, sometimes attempts this through promises of economic gain; part of Trump’s logic for the wall builds on the internal economic benefit we would supposedly experience. In reality, policies such as these are half-heartedly disguised discrimination, with no true purpose except to alleviate the diminishing whiteness of the country. Trump’s efforts allow Midwesterners to assign real consequences to perceived issues in society, even if the two phenomena are unrelated.
Very few of Trump’s racist or sexist supporters would proudly declare themselves as such, but decrying economic instability allows them to backwardly incorporate their prejudices into policy. Supposedly recovering from financial difficulty makes them vulnerable, creating a harder demographic to challenge: Who can tell another that they aren’t going through hardship? It is true that these people feel vulnerable. But their fears aren’t based in fact. They’re rooted in prejudice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 3, 2017, at 10:57 p.m.
After nearly a year of public meetings, zoning hearings, and revisions, Washington, D.C.-based restaurant chain &pizza has finally gained approval to bring its make-your-own pizza pies to Harvard Square.
The restaurant, which will share its space with New York-based dessert-bakery Milk Bar after receiving an initial rejection from the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal, will move into the former Tory Row and Crimson Corner spaces at the intersection of Mass Ave., JFK St., and Brattle St.
&pizza first set its sights on the corner location in January, when the property owner of Crimson Corner ended the newsstand’s lease. A few months prior, in October, the neighboring restaurant Tory Row closed shop, creating an opportunity for &pizza to take over two adjacent storefronts.
The ensuing permitting process took an unusual amount of time, largely due to community pushback on the pizza company’s store design and the abundance of other pizza shops in the Square. In late April, the Board of Zoning Appeals denied &pizza’s application to open at 1-8 Brattle.
Over the course of the summer, though, &pizza submitted a revised bid—this time in partnership with Milk Bar—that received approval at last Thursday’s Board of Zoning Appeals meeting with a unanimous vote.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she thinks the 5-0 zoning board vote—including support from the chair, whom she said rarely votes for fast food establishments—reflects the work of &pizza to incorporate the board’s design suggestions and community feedback.
In a statement released Friday, &pizza said it was pleased with the result and excited to move forward.
“We will continue to be conscientious in our approach to what we can offer the square to add to its rich cultural identity,” the release read. “The pizza shop meets bakery concept has aspirations to not only increase the variety of our offerings and enhance our experience, but also to provide a concept that caters to what the community needs – a positive, inclusive gathering place for all citizens.”
One group of Cantabrigians, however, remains concerned about &pizza’s arrival and have launched a protest related to &pizza’s use of the term “tribe members” and their culture of encouraging employees and customers to get ampersand tattoos. As part of a promotion earlier this year, for instance, the chain offered some customers the chance to get an ampersand tattoo in exchange for free pizza for a year.
The advocacy group Our Harvard Square has launched a change.org petition urging &pizza to “abstain from further use of body tattoos in corporate branding efforts” and “desist from referring to employees as ‘tribe members’ or similar terms.”
At a Harvard Square Neighborhood Association meeting Sunday night, Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and founder of the HSNA, said she thought &pizza’s branding was inappropriate.
In response, &pizza spokesperson Rachel Van Dolsen wrote in an email that the ampersand symbolizes unity and bringing people together.
“We encourage our customers and employees to bring their own meaning to the ampersand symbol –  some get it inked, others do not,” she wrote.
Others say they look forward to &pizza’s move into Harvard Square.
Jillson said she eagerly awaits the restaurant’s opening, because the properties in question have been vacant since Tory Row’s closure in October and Crimson Corner’s move in January.
“It’s been dark and uninviting for months now, so it’ll be good to have some activity in that space,” she said. “It’s been almost a year that’s been dark, and that’s not helpful. It’s not helpful to the Square. It’s not helpful to the abutters. It’s not helpful to anybody.”

Standing against the backdrop of a large yellow excavator, University President Drew G. Faust and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh shoveled sand to ceremonially break ground at William F. Smith Field—a park adjacent to Harvard Stadium in Allston—on Monday.
Harvard and the City of Boston have jointly funded the $6.5 million renovation of the Smith Field complex, which will include improved public sports fields, new walking paths, a playground, a street hockey court, and an amphitheater for performances.
During the ceremony, Mayor Walsh thanked Faust and Harvard for assisting in funding these renovations.
The City of Boston Capital Improvement Fund is paying for $3.3 million of the project and three other sources have collectively contributed $1 million. Harvard will allocate $1.9 million of its $5.35 million flexible fund for public improvements in Allston towards funding the first phase of construction. The University also footed the $700,000 bill for pathway construction around the park.
Allstonians, the City, and Harvard prioritized this project in the University’s 2013 Institutional Master Plan and community benefits planning, according to Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
Faust praised the renovations as a way to strengthen ties between the University and Allston residents.
"Public parks provide an important reminder of our responsibilities to our environment, to our neighborhoods and to each other,” Faust said.
Beyond serving recreational purposes, the 14-acre park is named after William F. Smith, who died in World War I, is a memorial.
Last year, the City of Boston Parks Commission voted to name the new amphitheater after General George Casey, an Allston resident who died while serving in Vietnam. Casey’s widow and son were among the 100 attendees of the event.
Millie H. McLaughlin, an Allston resident on the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said it was wonderful to see residents and representatives from the Mayor’s Office, Boston Planning & Development Agency, Harvard University, Boston Parks & Recreation, and the armed forces come together to celebrate.
“That’s half the fun—meeting up with your neighbors,” McLaughlin said.
Longtime Allston resident Joyce Radnor said Smith Field is an important gathering place for the community with the renovation “long overdue.”
“If Harvard’s renderings of the project are indeed what the community will see next summer, I think it’s going to be fabulous,” she said.

Chief Executive Officer of the World Bank Kristalina I. Georgieva outlined the causes of rising poverty in some areas of the world and methods to reduce it in an address at the Institute of Politic’s JFK Jr. Forum Tuesday evening.
Georgieva’s address revolved around the World Bank’s mission to reduce global poverty and assist the growth of developing countries. She highlighted the dramatic decline in poverty in recent decades, but also emphasized that the progress has not been shared equally.
“Poverty has shrunk so significantly to 800 million people out of our 7.3 billion population,” Georgieva said, “But behind the averages, we ought to recognize a very ugly trend in far too many places, and it is where extreme poverty is not only not shrinking, it is actually growing.”
Georgieva was a Bulgarian politician before she became CEO of the World Bank in early 2017. Before that, she served as Commissioner for Budget and Human Resources in the European Union. She has held numerous positions in the World Bank Group and been involved in international affairs since the early 1990s.
Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, who is currently director of the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, introduced the lecture in honor of another former Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who served as the first World Bank President.
Georgieva ran through what she viewed as the most impactful causes of rising poverty in some locations. She cited wars, gender inequality, climate change, and bad governance as being among the heaviest hitters, and especially lamented the effect of armed conflict on poverty levels. She described, for example, how the war in Syria brought the poverty level of the formerly middle-income country to as high as 60 percent.
Audience members had the chance to ask questions ranging from the history of the World Bank’s involvement in healthcare to their involvement in funding a dam on the Nile.
“I thought her answer was very informative because I’ve been learning a lot in my classes about the 20th century and how the World Bank played a role there, but it’s interesting to see going forward how their role in healthcare is changing and how the funding messes have been changing,” Sanika Mahajan ’21 said.
Georgieva talked about possible solutions to the problems she introduced, but concluded by speaking more broadly about the importance of “collective action” and working together.
“Here are our choice: there are two. One is realistic and the other one is fantastic. The realistic choice is extraterrestrials would come from space and make us work together, and the fantastic is we would do it ourselves. So we see it as our mission at the Bank to actually swap the places of those two,” she said.

Lizabeth A. Cohen, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, announced Tuesday that she will step down in June 2018 after seven years in the post.
A scholar of 20th century American history, Cohen was appointed interim dean in 2011. University President Drew G. Faust subsequently named Cohen dean of the University’s smallest unit in 2012.
Cohen has previously served as chair of Harvard’s History department and co-chair of the University’s Common Spaces Committee. Her book, “Making a New Deal: Industrial Workers in Chicago, 1919–1939,” won the Bancroft Prize in American History.
“When I accepted President Drew Faust’s invitation to join Radcliffe in 2011 on an interim basis, I certainly didn’t expect to find myself, nearly seven years later, stepping down as the Institute’s longest-serving dean,” Cohen wrote in a message to Radcliffe affiliates.
The Radcliffe Institute was established after the official merger of Radcliffe College and Harvard University in 1999. The Institute is now home to a fellowship program and the Schlesinger Library, dedicated to documenting the lives of women in America.
Cohen wrote that she thinks the Institute’s work is “more valuable now than ever” to the world.
“In an era of extreme pressure for quick answers and short-term results, the Institute plays a vital role by maintaining an unwavering dedication to the pursuit of deep, curiosity-driven research to advance knowledge and serve the public good,” Cohen added.
Cohen made headlines in November when she waded into the political fray for her criticism of Trump’s then-chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon. Cohen and presidents of six historically women’s colleges penned an open letter criticizing Bannon for comments reflecting “racism, anti-Semitism, and more.”
In 1973, she received her undergraduate degree from Princeton University as part of the institution’s first class that included women. She earned her Ph.D. in History from University of California, Berkeley and later taught at New York University.
“Under Liz’s guidance, the Radcliffe Institute has thrived as a sophisticated home for inventive thinkers and unbounded research,” Faust wrote in an email to Radcliffe affiliates. “I am deeply grateful to Liz for the dedication she has provide to this unique part of our important community.”
Cohen will return to her professorship in the History department of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences following a sabbatical year, according to Faust. Her departure will add an additional leadership opening for Harvard as the University continues to search for Faust’s successor, as well.
Cohen was not immediately available for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 4, 2017, at 11:28 a.m.
Harvard University Information Technology, familiar to most undergraduates for their service station in the basement of the Science Center, is getting an upgrade as they move to a 61,000 square foot facility at 784 Memorial Dr.
To most students, HUIT is a place to bring broken laptops or complaints about the wireless internet on campus. In addition to addressing day-to-day issues, though, the department is responsible for a host of services including maintaining and upgrading the University’s internet, information security, and software infrastructure.
Currently HUIT employs over 650 employees with offices spread out over 13 buildings. In an email, Acacia Matheson, Senior Communications Officer for HUIT, wrote that the newly leased offices at 784 Memorial Drive will allow for better intra-department collaboration.
“Co-location allows for more face-to-face interaction, helps to accelerate communication, and creates more opportunities for teams to collaborate—ultimately making it easier to get things done in HUIT and be more responsive to community needs,” Matheson wrote.
HUIT’s new accommodations sit on the Charles River roughly halfway between Harvard and MIT. Although the building’s exterior, recognizable for its signature clock face, has changed little since its construction in 1937, the interior of the former chemical plant has been completely renovated. The building, which also served as the headquarters for Polaroid, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Half of HUIT’s staff will be moving to the historic building. Walk-in support centers, including the Science Center office, will remain in their current locations so that students and faculty can easily access support staff.
“Maintaining a convenient presence for the students, faculty, and staff we serve, is top of mind,” Matheson wrote. “HUIT is in the process of determining what teams will benefit the most from being co-located, and expects to make a final decision by the end of fall about which teams will move to 784 Memorial Drive.”
Matheson said HUIT hopes that the move down the river doesn’t distance them from the Harvard community but rather makes their offices more accessible to students and faculty.
“HUIT expects that 784 Memorial Drive will be a destination not only for the IT organization, but for the broader Harvard community as well,” Matheson said. “The building has common spaces that will allow HUIT to host events such as hackathons, guest lectures, and other IT-related programming.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 6, 2017 at 11:09 p.m.
“Tweedy Victorian relics.” “Abhorrent.” “Bastion of white male privilege.” “Poisonous.”
At the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ monthly meeting Tuesday, professors did not mince words describing Harvard’s unrecognized social organizations.
But the ongoing administrative effort to curb the presence of fraternities, sororities, and final clubs on campus also drew ire, as faculty rebuked the effort in turn as “imprudent,” “draconian,” “repressive,” and a “clumsy virtue-signal.”
Since University President Drew G. Faust announced a historic policy on final clubs and Greek organizations in May 2016, faculty members have hotly debated the policy in their monthly meetings. Filling Science Center C on Tuesday, they appeared no closer to consensus.
Three social life policy-related issues sat on the docket for the meeting: former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68’s anti-sanctions motion, Government professor Danielle S. Allen’s new motion seeking to apply Student Handbook policies to co-educational social organizations, and a presentation from Music professor Suzannah Clark on the final report of the committee tasked with reviewing the current policy.
A week prior, the Faculty Council—the highest governing body of the FAS—provided non-binding advisory votes on each motion, voting down the Lewis motion 16-2 and affirming the Allen motion 17-0. The full Faculty will not vote on either motion until November at the earliest.
The committee’s report, however, is not up for a Faculty vote, and has gone to Faust for the final decision. It lays out three options: maintain the current policy penalizing members of single-gender fraternities, sororities, and final clubs; ban membership altogether in unrecognized single-gender social groups; or consider a set of “some other possible solutions.”
“As Harvard becomes more diverse, it is untenable to have USGSOs scripting campus life,” Clark said. “Our students are watching us. They are looking to us to find the right catalyst to bring about reform. Our students are eager for reform. Are we?”
Faculty members were eager to take up Clark’s challenge—so much so that Faust extended the meeting, already moved from its normal location in University Hall to the Science Center due to high anticipated attendance.
Lewis and his fellow motion signatories were quick to question the validity of the committee’s report.
“The caricature of off-campus clubs as bastions of privilege, full of the stock of the Puritans learning to discriminate against other people, is not based in fact, certainly not in any facts presented in the report,” Lewis said. “Indeed, the report contains almost no facts of any kind.”
“When the reasons offered for a given policy change as frequently as they have in this case, we should begin to wonder whether the policy in question has anything to do with reasons,” Government Professor Eric M. Nelson agreed. “The bottom line here, as it seems to me, is that we just don’t like these clubs. And some of them, at least, clearly merit our dislike.”
Still, other Faculty members jumped to support the committee’s work and criticize Lewis’s motion, which would prevent the University from disciplining students based on the organizations they join. This is Lewis’s second anti-sanctions motion: he withdrew the first one in January, after formation of the Faculty committee.
“I recall, Harry, that you would have closed [the clubs] if you could have, but our nonrecognition doctrine toward them made that problematic at that time. But you were no fan of theirs because you saw in Ad Board case after Ad Board case what could happen in them,” former Dean of FAS William C. Kirby said, addressing Lewis. “These opportunities don’t come very often for an institution, and we should not miss ours.”
The third social group docket item, Allen’s motion, would utilize a 1989 Massachusetts statute to declare co-educational clubs “student organizations” that are subject to Harvard's Student Handbook policies, and membership in single-gender organizations would preclude enrollment at the College. Allen’s proposal was dismissed by the committee in its report as unworkable.
“We should expect that this campus will have a diversity of student organizations, including social organizations, and we should expect that many of them will be examples of birds-of-a-feather-flocking-together,” Allen said. “But we should require of these flocks that they adhere to policies of non-discrimination and the other policies governing students’ participation in student organizations."
In their statements before the Faculty, Lewis and Allen each criticized the other’s motion.
“There is no silver bullet in Professor Allen’s astonishingly sweeping motion either,” Lewis said. “It is time for a statement of principle from the faculty, not a carte blanche handoff to the administration.”
Allen retorted that while College administrators may be overstepping, Lewis and his supporters are championing freedom of association at the expense of other rights.
“The administration has made a claim for regulation that seems to be, analytically speaking, without limit,” Allen said. “The other side has appeared to treat associational rights as if they may never be weighed in the balance against other rights and freedoms.”
Undergraduate Council President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 also spoke at the meeting, encouraging Faculty to take action but avoid an outright ban on social organizations.
“USGSOs are omnipresent and omnipotent,” Sachee said. “It is not our desire, nor we presume is it the administration's, to be the social secretaries for 6,700 undergraduates.”
Sachee, a member of the Bee Club, promised to return to the November meeting with a recommendation “on behalf of the student body.”
The Faculty will continue discussion of the Lewis and Allen motions at their November meeting, where both motion will eligible for a vote. Lewis has requested a paper ballot for November.

This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: October 5, 2017
A previous version of this story did not properly communicate the intention of Government professor Danielle S. Allen's faculty motion. Rather than recognizing final clubs as student groups, the motion seeks to apply the College's Student Handbook standards to co-educational social groups. As Allen details in a letter to the editor, the motion would also bar students from joining single-gender groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton demanded Congressional action and stricter gun control in his address at Morning Prayers on Tuesday.
Speaking to over 50 people who gathered for the service, Walton decried the frequency of gun violence in the United States.
“As the leader of a local faith community, I have become quite proficient at holding prayer vigils in response to mass shootings,” he said. “This level of gun violence is not normal.”
Walton’s remarks came in response to the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. From the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, Stephen Paddock opened fire on a crowd attending a country music concert on the Las Vegas strip, killing 59 people and injuring more than 500.
Walton argued that Americans must do more than pray for victims of and families affected by the massacre, declaring that accessibility to guns—Paddock had multiple semiautomatic rifles in his hotel room—is the fundamental issue.
Calling the National Rifle Association a “domestic terror organization that places profit above the lives of the American people,” Walton claimed that leaders of the gun lobbying agency “prefer that we keep distributing candles while they make mass murder more efficient.”
“Gun rights defenders will accuse me of politicizing this tragedy, yet if we follow this logic, it will never be the time, since such tragedies occur with such pathological regularity in this nation,” he said. “Don’t ask me to pray. Don’t ask me to hold a vigil for victims, nor will I light any more candles.”
Siddharth E. George, a fifth-year graduate student who attended the sermon, said he sympathized with Walton’s impatience with the rate of gun law reform but was pessimistic that change would come.
“I have no idea, and I don’t think people have very good ideas,” George said. “And the kind of activist energy that we are likely to see in the next two weeks is likely to be ineffective, just like all the ones in the past have been.”

Planning for the College’s newest pre-orientation program targeted at students from first generation, low-income, and under resourced high schools marches forward as the program irons out logistics and solicits student input.
The pre-orientation program will last for four days, the same length as the First-Year International Program, and will have a cap of approximately 100 incoming freshmen, according to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
This program, intended to help students transition to life at Harvard, resembles a similar proposal rejected by Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in January. The College reversed course in August, however, when Khurana announced that Harvard would “pilot” a new freshman pre-orientation program in 2018 following “much respectful dialogue last spring.”
“We want to make sure this is an approach that is both informed by best practices for supporting students from first-gen, low-income backgrounds, or [who] come from under resourced high schools,” Khurana said in a September interview. “We want to do it in a way that makes sense for Harvard.”
Khurana added that the goal of the program will be to engage students “holistically,” encompassing both the academic and social components of college life.
Dingman said all incoming freshmen, regardless of their background, are welcome to participate and that current students will be important in developing the new pre-orientation pilot.
“All of us feel that this will not be successful if it’s a top-down fix. We need to be talking to students about what they’ve experienced and involving them in the planning of this,” Dingman said. “We know that as students seek help, what they get from their peers is huge.”
Indeed, the Freshman Dean’s Office has already enlisted the help of campus groups such as the First Generation Student Union.
“We’ve been working with administration since the first news about the rejection of the original proposal.” said Andrew Perez ’20, president of the FGSU.
Perez has been working with the FDO to develop the program and will serve as part of the organization's future leadership.
An advisory committee of students, faculty, and staff, will begin the planning for the program by developing an assessment system for the pilot initiative and interviewing for the program’s new director.
Katie W. Steele, director of College initiatives and student development, oversees all the FDO’s pre-orientation programs. Steele said that the FDO continues to solicit student input for program ideas and encourages interested individuals to become involved with its implementation.
“We really want as many students as possible to offer their suggestions, their ideas, for both the content of the program, but also for being on the steering committee or being a leader,” Steele said.
Next August, the new initiative will join five existing pre-orientation programs: Dorm Crew’s Fall Clean-Up, the First-Year Arts Program, the First-Year International Program, the First-Year Outdoor Program, and the First-Year Urban Program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the thirteenth year in a row, most Cambridge residents will see little to no increase in their property tax rates, according to a report presented to the City Council Monday night.
The report, presented in a special meeting of the city finance committee by City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, said that new commercial growth in the city helped maintain lower tax rates, while an increase in the city’s property tax fund has allowed the council to increase support for local initiatives. The budget also outlined expected spending for the next year, including key projects and infrastructure development.
“This is very, very, really good news for the taxpayers here in Cambridge.” DePasquale said. “For the first time, we took $2.8 million and put it towards the affordable housing Trust.”
“The City has been able to achieve a lower property tax rate and lower residential property tax bill than surrounding communities due to its ability to generate diverse non-property tax revenues, foster new construction, control budget growth, and plan prudent use of reserves,” the report reads.
According to City Councillor Jan Devereux, divided out, the residential tax rate will be $6.29 per thousand dollars of value, which marks a 3.1 percent decrease from last year. The commercial tax rate will be $14.81, which is an 8.1 percent decrease. Twenty-three percent of residents will see a decrease in their tax rate this year, while another 45.4 percent will see an increase of 100 dollars or less.
Devereux, along with other Councillors, also spoke out in favor of the programs that the city supports with its tax funds, which include Vision Zero, Cambridge’s bicycle fatality reduction program, and Cambridge’s comprehensive early childhood system, which provides free Kindergarten and early development programs to residents.
“Our programs we provide for our citizens are second to none” councillor Michael J. Toomey Jr. said.
Councillors were also pleased with the city’s first investment in the affordable housing trust, a fund designed to help combat the city’s affordable housing crisis by supporting development projects. The adopted budget notes that these funds have already been used to support affordable housing development projects, like the Concords Highland project.
The city assessors reported that the city added about $16 million of primarily commercial growth over the past year. They also said that the city’s AAA credit rating leaves it with “enormous flexibility” in responding to the financial needs of the city.
When asked why the credit rate was so important by Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, the assessors responded that the extra interest on projects could be in excess of $1 million.“Overall, this is something we should be very, very proud of” DePasquale said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Interim Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench said there was nothing “unusual” about Harvard’s decision to not admit Michelle Jones, a formerly incarcerated scholar whose rejection from the History department’s Ph.D. program gained national attention earlier this year.
At Tuesday's meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Anthropology professor Rowan K. Flad took the microphone during the open question period to ask why Jones, who served over twenty years in prison, was not admitted to Harvard. Jones’s application was the subject of a story published in the Marshall Project, which covers criminal justice issues, and the New York Times last month. The story prompted more than 150 professors to sign a letter condemning the decision to reject Jones.
Flad asked how often the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences overruled departmental decisions on Ph.D. candidates and if GSAS typically considers criminal history when making admissions decisions.
“As I understand it, a recommendation of admission by the department of History was not accepted in this case by the GSAS dean, but an explanation for why the recommendation was not accepted has not been given, as far as I know, although an explanation has been requested,” Flad said.
University President Drew G. Faust directed the question to Dench, who did not have administrative oversight of GSAS at the time of Jones application; Permanent GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng, who oversaw the admissions process, began a sabbatical this academic year. Dench said she did not know why Jones was not admitted, and a spokesperson for Meng declined to comment on Jones’s application.
Dench said she worried that the recent press coverage surrounding Jones’ application has created a breach of privacy for the University. Harvard does not discuss the status of any applicant past or present.
“I think one of the disturbing aspects of the fallout from the New York Times article has been the disclosure of very confidential details which put our whole process in peril,” Dench said.
Flad said that he has heard three speculative reasons why Jones wasn’t admitted: the administration was “concerned more about the optics of admitting an applicant with a criminal past,” GSAS didn’t believe Jones was prepared for the program, or that Jones did not adequately disclose her criminal history on her application.
“As if any of our Ph.D. applicants detail in full all aspects of their past,” he said.
Dench responded by saying that there was nothing “unusual” about the process by which Jones was not selected for admission.
"I think it’s possible to have the absolutely wrong impression that the lists are rubber-stamped, which I can assure you they are not,” she said, referring to departmental selections for Ph.D. candidates.
In regards to Flad’s second question, Dench said that past incarceration alone would not preclude a candidate from being accepted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 4, 2017 at 5:02 p.m.
In an “unusual” step, the Harvard Corporation has voted to allow schools to take capped amounts of money out of the endowment for the next three fiscal years in an effort to insulate budgets from fluctuations in Harvard’s investment returns.
In an interview last Wednesday, University President Drew G. Faust said the Corporation set a 2.5 percent distribution increase rate for Harvard’s schools, though that number can increase in subsequent years all the way up to 4.5 percent.
Money from the endowment—now valued at $37.1 billion—funds more than a third of Harvard’s annual operating budget. Because Harvard’s operating costs steadily increases every year, a product of inflation and other factors, the University relies on larger payouts from the endowment every year. But in recent years, Harvard’s endowment has underperformed, imperiling the University’s ability to pay its ever-increasing bills.
With the change in policy, though, the Corporation has signaled that— barring unforseen circumstances—Harvard’s 12 schools can expect at least a 2.5 percent increase in the amount of money it gets from the endowment for the next three years.
“Essentially, it holds the University budgets harmless. It’s going to distribute from the endowment as if the endowment returns were significantly higher,” Faust said in the interview.
For fiscal year 2017, the firm returned a “disappointing” 8.1 percent, which its CEO N.P. Narvekar said was a symptom of “deep structural problems at HMC.”
Narvekar has embarked on an ambitious restructuring of the way the firm invests in an attempt to revitalize its investment performance, though he’s repeatedly cautioned the results of his undertaking likely won’t materialize for another few years.
In the interim, the Corporation has set a “collar” for the endowment’s annual distribution. The lowest distribution increase it might set is 2.5 percent, while the highest it would consider is 4.5 percent.
Faust said the unprecedented move was motivated by concern that disappointing endowment returns might continue to “cripple” Harvard’s programs. After Harvard returned negative 2 percent in fiscal year 2016, Faust warned that budgets would be “constrained” for years to come.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences and graduate students each received modest pay bumps for the year that were outpaced by the rate of inflation, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences cut its admissions rate by 4.4 percent.
Without the new policy, Faust warned in the interview that there would have been a 1 percent increase in the amount of money distributed to school budgets in fiscal year 2019.
“That is of course very difficult because people get raises and inflation happens, and there are other costs that inevitably increase,” Faust said. With the new policy, Deans should not have to “take money out of unrestricted funds or other things in order to compensate for a flat distribution.”
The policy has dangers, though. If capital markets go belly-up and the endowment’s value plunges, as it did during the 2008 financial crash, Harvard’s schools will be drawing from a depleted endowment.
Faust said in the interview that the policy was also designed to lay a solid financial foundation for her successor—yet unchosen—who will take over as President of the University this summer.
“I think we also felt that the first year of a new president’s regime should not be one of extreme constraint,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took the best game of senior goalkeeper Kyle Parks’ career to give Harvard men’s soccer a chance on Tuesday afternoon.
Led by Parks, the Crimson (3-5-1, 1-0 Ivy League) looked to continue its winning ways in a midweek, non-conference fixture at Jordan Field, but ultimately had to settle for a tense 1-1 double overtime draw against the University of New Hampshire (6-1-3, 0-1 America East).
Fresh off of its first loss of the season, the No. 21 Wildcats applied pressure early, sending a barrage of shots at Parks in the Crimson net.
Harvard was fortunate not to concede a goal in the first half. The Wildcats, who registered an impressive seven shutouts in their first nine games, dominated possession and attempted seven first-half shots.
“We knew they were a good team coming in,” senior midfielder Christian Sady said. “But we try to approach each game with the same mentality. We try to dictate the game and not play to their level.”
The first half ended without a goal, but a score felt inevitable as the second half began. In the 51st minute, Parks made a terrific stop at point blank range to deny New Hampshire sophomore Jack Doherty. On the ensuing counterattack, sophomore forward Philip Hausen slipped a perfect ball past a defender and into the box to freshman midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso. The former U.S. Men’s National Team U-18 product coolly tucked the ball past Wildcats keeper Andrew Pesci and into the back of the net to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead in the 52nd minute.
Only Harvard’s second shot on goal of the contest, Belloni-Urso’s score shifted momentum Harvard’s way, albeit momentarily.
Immediately following the goal, the Crimson gave the ball away with poor passing, giving Doherty yet another chance one-on-one. But once again, Parks denied him. The Wildcats continued to send numbers forward following Belloni-Urso’s goal, desperate to find an equalizer.
In the 66th minute, a cross into the Harvard penalty box finally proved deadly for the Crimson. Freshman defender Fernando Docters was whistled for a penalty while defending a New Hampshire attacker. Junior Chris Arling converted the ensuing penalty kick for the visitors, sending Parks the wrong way and knotting the game, 1-1.
Spurred on by the equalizer, the Wildcats continued to press, as Parks was drawn into denying yet another one-on-one opportunity from New Hampshire forward Robin Schmidt with 20 minutes remaining.
There were several tense moments in the waning minutes of the game, with the Wildcats appearing to score a go-ahead goal before being called for a foul. With the score still tied at one apiece after 90 minutes, both squads prepared themselves for additional play.
Building on the momentum they generated in the waning moments of regular time, New Hampshire threatened first in overtime, after being awarded an indirect free kick inside the box. But Arling’s low shot was denied at close-range by a wall of Harvard defenders, keeping the Crimson alive.
The Wildcats continued to press Harvard’s defense for the rest of the match, but Parks and the rest of the back line held firm under the challenge. Parks’ play was the highlight of the second overtime, as the netminder rejected three more attempts from Arling and Doherty at point blank range. Parks recorded a total of eleven saves over the course of the contest, four more than his previous career-high single-game total.
“Kyle [Parks] was incredible,” said co-captain and defender Eric Gylling. “They were going down our throats and Kyle [Parks] kept us in it through all of that”.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a dirt field somewhere in middle America, a far-too-intense defensive coordinator is screaming at some panting high schoolers, “offense sells tickets but it’s defense that wins championships.” Well, rumor has it Harvard coach Tim Murphy is looking for his 10th Ivy League championship.
If the last two games are any indication, Harvard may be well on its way. The Crimson has fielded a starting 11 that have been all but perfect in the last two contests, allowing a combined four points in the first three quarters of each of those games.
Last weekend’s 41-2 victory was a particularly powerful showcase of Harvard’s defensive prowess. Facing off  against Georgetown in the nation’s capital, the Crimson company held their opponents to four points and 201 total yards, a mere 46 of which were earned on the ground.
Harvard’s first major defensive strike of the game came as Georgetown threatened to tie the score at seven early in the first quarter. Driving toward the Crimson goal line, Georgetown junior quarterback Clay Norris was buried by senior defensive tackle Stone Hart, who knocked the ball out of Norris’ grasp and halted the incursion into Harvard territory. The sack was one of two that resulted in Norris coughing up the ball. In total, the Crimson defense racked up four sacks on the day, dropping Norris 36 yards.
The Georgetown quarterback didn’t just struggle to get the ball out of his hands, but had difficulty getting it past Harvard’s secondary as well, finishing the game 13 of 29 through the air. The backbreaker came early in the second when a toss from Norris was grabbed by Crimson senior cornerback Raishaun McGhee and returned to the house. With the 21-point lead, Harvard didn’t look back.
In its Ivy League opener against Brown in front a friendly crowd, Harvard showed a similar defensive domination—at least for the first three quarters.
The Bears didn’t achieve a first down until their seventh drive of the afternoon, discounting a Crimson penalty late in the first quarter. The team’s first six drives totaled 33 yards, and at the half, Brown had earned just nine rushing yards and 67 through the air.
At the end of the third quarter, the Bears brought senior quarterback Thomas Linta in off the bench. The veteran scored 26 points nearly singlehandedly, dragging Brown back into the game just before time expired and spoiling the defensive shutout that Harvard had maintained until the fourth quarter.
Prior to the matchup with Brown, the Crimson defense had not been as exceptional. The defining moment for the team came before the end of the first half against Rhode Island freshman cornerback Ben Abercrombie sustained an injury.
Pursuing the Rams wide out toward the sideline, Abercrombie pushed him out of bounds but remained on the ground after the sound of the whistle. He has since undergone surgery for a major neck injury at a Rhode Island hospital.
Since the end of that first half, Harvard’s defense has played with a chip on its shoulder, dominating opponents and daring quarterbacks to drop back and thrown. The ferocity with which the Crimson curtain has responded to the loss of one of its own has been impressive.
It will now likely extend that defensive dominance this weekend in the matchup against conference rival Cornell. Offensively weak and defensively vulnerable, Cornell will be a springboard for the defense as it heads towards tougher league opponents.
Throughout football history, it has been typical to see offensive juggernauts battle it out in their respective league’s biggest stage. Every once in awhile, though, a truly great defensive team will stake a claim for the crown. Teams like the 2015 Denver Broncos or the 2013 Seattle Seahawks come along to remind everybody that it is defense that rules the sport.
For the Ivy League, Harvard just may just fulfill that role. If this defensive ferocity is sustainable, the Crimson’s fifth Ivy crown in six seasons is well within reach.
