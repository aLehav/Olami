After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The buzzword surrounding press coverage of Kristen Roupenian’s debut short story collection is “uncomfortable.” The term nestles into headlines of interviews and reviews alike. Take this profile, which proclaims that Roupenian “hopes her new book leaves you ‘uncomfortable’ and ‘shaken.’” Another profile begins with a quote from the writer herself: “As a reader, I am hungry to be uncomfortable,” she says. The New York Times review of the collection sums up Roupenian’s entire enterprise in a pithy headline: “Other Tales of Discomfort.” The title itself appropriates and subverts the language of violation: “You Know You Want This,” as if there is no choice.
Discomfort is Roupenian’s selling point; it’s the mode that makes her fiction work. It was the thematic enterprise of “Cat Person,” the viral short story for which she is best known, which appeared in the New Yorker at the height of the #MeToo movement in December 2017. Its plot — about a 20-year-old woman’s relationship with an older man that becomes a disturbing power play — rang disturbingly true among women in a cultural moment of reckoning for powerful men.
Aesthetically, “Cat Person” is a middling story, given its tendencies toward blunt sentences and uninspired imagery. But on some level — thanks to some combination of auspicious timing and its endeavor toward subtlety in the #MeToo discourse — “Cat Person” worked. The point of the story was not to state the obvious, that sexual harassment and assault are bad (of course they are), but instead to question the very nature of heterosexual sex itself. Evoking Andrea Dworkin, “Cat Person” aspired to examine the institutional understanding of heterosexual romance by shedding light on its inherent power structure. Blatant instances of sexual abuse and harassment are, unfortunately, widespread. But even more widespread are patriarchal romance and sex, seemingly innocuous, but latent with disturbing power dynamics. For many straight women, the kind of gendered power in “Cat Person” is not a freak occurrence, but rather, a commonplace reality, part of the fabric of their everyday lives.
Subtlety was what made “Cat Person” so compelling. Regrettably, it’s precisely what’s missing from “You Know You Want This.” Gone is the subtle interplay between characters, Roupenian’s knack for tracking the undercurrents of tension in normal conversations. Instead of simmering discomfort, Roupenian goes messily for the jugular, venturing into the realm of the macabre, the murderous, the shockingly graphic. In her stories, sex has a body count. Love — erotic, platonic, familial, and otherwise — is full of casualties. Save for “The Good Guy,” the stories in the collection tend toward inelegant, blown-up allegories that are vehicles of symbolism, and clearer vehicles of delivering blood and guts on the page. To follow the bodily metaphor to its absurd extreme, “Cat Person” operates with the tact of neurosurgery. The rest of “You Know You Want This” reads more like blunt force trauma.
Unsubtle allegories litter the pages of “You Know You Want This,” whose trajectories fall into familiar and quickly repetitive patterns of sadism and masochism. Benign situations turn dark! A quick sample: A venture into polyamory goes awry when the couple gets possessive over their third in “Bad Boy.” In “Look At Your Game, Girl,” a 12-year-old girl’s encounter with a local drifter diverges from a potential abduction scenario, but only just. A prepubescent girl’s tenth birthday party in “Sardines” ends in a freakish human centipede-esque horror show in which “overlapping bodies become one body.” A parasite assumed to be a woman’s imagined symptom of psychosis becomes real, infecting her boyfriend, in “The Matchbox Sign.” Somehow, these stories all seem like drafts of the same story, or perhaps inhabiting the same fictive universe of white middle class suburbia-brand Twilight Zone (with the exception of “Night Runner,” which takes place in what is presumably Kenya). These conceits, fantastical as though they may seem, have the approximate action value of sped-up footage of mold accumulating on old fruit: the unfolding of predictable events, as one learns to expect them. But it’s not so much the subject matter; after all, the right writer can make a day at the office into an exhilarating adventure, but the wrong one can turn a murder mundane. As Roupenian chases each story to its anticlimactic ending, they feel like they’ve already been bled dry.
There’s the obvious counterpoint, which is that Roupenian’s plot lines tend toward the schematic for allegorical purposes — that these characters are referents for capital “I” Ideas, like Adolescence and Consciousness and Motherhood, and their plights are a kind of modern fable. Indeed, “The Mirror, the Bucket, and the Old Thigh Bone” even literalizes the fable genre in a bizarrely twisted fairy tale on narcissism or perhaps women bent on escaping compulsory heterosexuality. “Biter,” the collection’s concluding story, also seems to gesture at a kind of feminist wish fulfillment for the modern era: Its protagonist flips the abuser-victim script on its head and gratifies her most primal urge.
Yet the didacticism argument isn’t quite satisfactory, not with a story so irresolute and opposed to moral dualisms as “Cat Person.” Or even “The Good Guy,” the collection’s longest story, which makes just enough room for a dose of humanity for each character. Perhaps herein lies the issue, that Roupenian skims the surface of most characters, who become stock caricatures. They’ve each got their shtick — a divorcée with an affinity for wine, a girl who likes to bite — but these epithets tend to reduce them to vehicles for action, as they become characters with opaque psychologies and unclear motives. They have become, to borrow an old creative writing adage, problems with people, rather than people with problems. Roupenian insists that we want this, we know we want this. But is it too much to ask for a little bit more?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the age of #MeToo, and Gillette wants to be part of the conversation. In an online-only advertisement that premiered three weeks before (and capitalized on) the buzz of Super Bowl commercials, the company released “We Believe: The Best Men Can Be,” which highlights various manifestations of toxic masculinity, followed by a harmony of men echoing, “Boys will be boys.” Cut to a montage of news anchors covering sexual assault allegations (and Terry Crews as the apparent leading activist), after which men begin to hold each other accountable, from scolding their friends for catcalling to telling their daughters that they are strong.
The reactions were varied and numerous. Thousands of men and women alike on YouTube and Twitter publically resolved to boycott Gillette products, rejecting the ad’s sweeping depiction of men and masculinity as inherently violent and chauvinistic. Susan Cantor, chief executive of branding firm RedPeak, told the Wall Street Journal, “Men are saying, we feel marginalized, criticized and accused rather than feeling inspired empowered and encouraged.” In direct opposition, many commended the ad for shining light on the ways in which men consciously and subconsciously inculcate ideas of masculinity into the next generations, and for providing concrete examples of productive accountability within communities of men. Yet another school of critique called the ad “quite conservative” for believing too strongly in the ability of men to reform themselves. Neil J. Young of the Huffington Post noted, “In Gillette’s world, there’s no need for a systematic dismantling of the patriarchy, no plea for a reassessment of entrenched gender roles. Men can fix it.”
No matter the polar and polarizing reactions to the ad, one thing is for certain: Gillette sparked conversation, and deliberately so, even if those conversations relied too heavily on buzzwords like “toxic masculinity.”
So the real question is: Does Gillette have a place in the #MeToo conversation?
One could argue that such companies have a responsibility to reverse the toxic versions of masculinity they helped to perpetuate throughout decades of advertising. But whether they are able to do so without profit as their key objective remains doubtful. Yes, perpetuating negative stereotypes of men initially seems to be at odds with the goal of winning them over as customers. But in actuality, women are often the purchasers for the household, and they have largely reacted positively to the ad — something the creative team behind “The Best Men Can Be” must have predicted from the ongoing dialogue surrounding #MeToo. Some market experts also posit that the ad was created to shift their target demographic to millenials who are more likely to align themselves with progressive social causes.
Companies that capitalize on social issues (a process that often also gives a gold star to the consumer to make them feel like they’ve “made a difference”) for visibility, relevance, and monetary gain are nothing new to the business world, and if anything, their attempts have been foiled repeatedly. “The Best Men Can Be” is hardly different. It exemplifies why commodity activism — the use of political messages to boost a company’s reputation and/or sales, which has surged during Trump’s presidency — is fundamentally incompatible with movements like #MeToo.
To summarize the company's tumultuous history, Gillette has constructed hyper-masculine ideas of manhood, all the while convincing women they need to be hairless to fulfill their potential for full feminine beauty (with their Venus-line razors wrapped in pretty pink packaging, of course). Their business depends on these insecurities. And now it is leveraging feminism — veiled, white feminism — in hopes of reinvigorating falling stocks. It’s no coincidence — what else can explain this sudden change in paradigm if not the very same thing that fuels all commodity activism?
Some have commented that, at the very least, Gillette’s attempt took risk, a kind of chutzpah that companies often avoid and instead cower behind “safe” campaigns like Pepsi’s infamous ad featuring Kendall Jenner in a flaccid homage to #BlackLivesMatter. Even so, this risk paid off, and Gillette knew it would: With 24 million views on YouTube and counting, Gillette is collecting the views it needs to convert them into sales.
Instead of controversy-seeking advertisements, then, Gillette should bring its energy inwards to the marketing of their actual products, to reverse the damage it has done in continuing to portray perfectly bearded men and hairless women — not attempt to address a multifaceted social movement in the span of two minutes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a time where many are looking back at the Bush Administration with admiration or nostalgia, director Adam McKay’s “Vice” serves as a reminder that the destructive tendencies of the 46th Vice President still matter in today’s political climate.
“Vice” takes a deep dive into the life of Dick Cheney (Christian Bale), from his introduction to Washington to his service as George W. Bush’s Vice President. McKay jumps between different points in Cheney’s life, beginning the movie with a mashup of Cheney’s 1962 DWI and the events surrounding 9/11. Overall, as the narrator observes, Cheney’s ability to remain in the shadows makes him “like a ghost.” To many, this image of the conniving insider seems incongruous with today's political landscape. To McKay, however, that image only drives home the point that governing experience could have made the present-day a whole lot worse.
At its core, “Vice” is a biased work. That would be a shortcoming — potentially a fatal one — had McKay shied away from including a certain post-credits scene. Without giving a spoiler, McKay at least acknowledges the limitations of telling this particular story at this moment in time. He makes it clear that this is probably not a movie meant for people who remember Bush’s two terms in detail, let alone fondly. The film — and the techniques it employs — are meant for a wider audience, one that may be younger and more out-of-touch with 2000s-era politics, but one with a good enough sense of humor to be made fun of.
Those techniques are at times masterful. Viewers familiar with McKay’s most recent film, “The Big Short,” know his attraction to using cutaways to explain arcane concepts. He does so again with fervor throughout “Vice” for topics such as unitary executive theory. McKay also tries his hand at writing a Shakespearean soliloquy, poking fun at his subject’s connections to works like “Macbeth.” Humor aside, the most jarring aspect of the film is its gleeful use of contrast through montage. At various points, McKay shows with precision the human effects of bombing raids in Southeast Asia, “enhanced interrogation techniques” in CIA black sites, and the destructive nature of the Fall of Baghdad. McKay wants the viewer to feel uncomfortable, maybe even guilty, about the consequences of the Bush Administration. It is a decision that critiques most character studies’ insistence on focusing only on its character, fashioning a post-modern lens by which the audience views a leader.
And it is time to focus on that leader. Many were surprised when Christian Bale was cast as Vice President Cheney, but he disappears into the role. Saying he is unrecognizable does him a disservice because, save for a few scenes in which he portrays a younger Cheney, he fully embodies the man in all his facets. In a strange turn of events, however, this character study is cast like an ensemble. Amy Adams is Dick’s wife Lynne, Sam Rockwell tries his hand at George W. Bush, and Steve Carell plays Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld like Brick Tamland from McKay’s “Anchorman.” Unlike Bale, however, they are all distinctly themselves as actors, and the film is all the better for it. Instead of attempting to be a faithful retelling of the Bush Administration — like Oliver Stone’s “W.” — “Vice” is the viewer remembering that era through funhouse mirrors where the people surrounding Cheney are literal celebrities.
But that interpretation leaves aside the film’s narrator and emotional anchor: Kurt, an Iraq War veteran played by Jesse Plemons. For an actor known for looking like other actors — Matt Damon and Philip Seymour Hoffman, to be exact — Plemons is enough of an unknown to be the film’s everyman, although his role ends up being pivotal. Without giving anything away, to say that he is the heart of the movie would be an understatement.
In the end, much like the way McKay depicts Cheney’s offer to manage the more “mundane” aspects of Bush’s presidency, “Vice” is ultimately a deal with the devil. McKay sacrifices objectivity for spectacle, informing the viewer that Cheney’s secrecy prevents the film from being fully factual. Whether or not the viewer agrees with that decision, it hamstrings the film’s ability to say something unique. Yes, a reminder of Cheney’s actions as Vice President is interesting and arguably necessary, but “Vice” will not sway Cheney adherents. As Bale’s Cheney admits to the camera, the Vice President “did what needed to be done,” at least, according to him. For some people, that will be enough to deride the movie as leftist baloney. In that sense, it does not matter if a McKay-directed documentary would receive a similar response. It is the unwelcome fate of telling an overtly political story in a time when its politics are still salient.
“Vice” was nominated for a leading six Golden Globe nominations. While the film can stand on that pedestal on its own merit, one can only hope that merit — and not liberal bias — will frame its narrative come awards season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Film critics and die-hard cinema aficionados alike rose early Tuesday morning in preparation for the announcement of this year’s Academy Award nominations. Leading the pack are Yorgos Lanthimos’ “The Favourite” and Alfonso Cuarón’s “Roma,” with 10 nominations each — though it’s a genuine toss-up as to which film will take home the award for Best Picture, with no apparent frontrunner. From controversial Best Picture nominations to unexpected snubs (Timothée Chalamet! Claire Foy! Emily Blunt!), we break down the 2019 Academy Award nominations below.
And the nominees for Best Picture are… “BlacKkKlansman,” “Black Panther,” “Bohemian Rhapsody,” “The Favourite,” “Green Book,” “Roma,” “A Star is Born,” and “Vice.”
As expected, both Golden Globes winners, “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Green Book,” earned a spot in the list of nominees, despite numerous scandals associated with both films. Frankly, it wouldn’t be surprising if “Green Book” took Best Picture, especially after its Golden Globe and Producers’ Guild of America Award wins, the latter of which usually predicts the Oscar winner. Beyond that, the lineup for Best Picture feels relatively level across the board. This year’s list of nominees did make history, though, when “Black Panther” proved itself to be a heavy-hitter with seven nominations, becoming the first superhero movie in history to garner the Best Picture nod.
Another milestone? With five Best Picture-nominated films focusing on people of color and over half involving LGBTQ themes, this could be the most diverse lineup yet — a long way from 2015’s #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which called for equal representation on the silver screen. Still, this year’s nominees missed the mark for representation elsewhere, in categories like Best Director, which featured only male directors, and with only one nominated film overall featuring an Asian storyline (Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Cannes darling “Shoplifters,” which received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film). Clearly, Hollywood still has a long way to go.
The nominees for Best Director are… Alfonso Cuarón (“Roma”), Yorgos Lanthimos (“The Favourite”), Spike Lee (“BlacKkKlansman”), Adam McKay (“Vice”), and Pawel Pawlikowski (“Cold War”).
Believe it or not, this is actually Spike Lee’s first Best Director nomination, despite a long career and cultural legacy which garnered him two Academy nominations for “Do the Right Thing” (1989) and “4 Little Girls” (1997).
Meanwhile, Bradley Cooper was excluded from the list of Best Director nominees. His remake of “A Star Is Born” was expected to be an awards season darling, but seemed to recede into the shadow (or Shallow?) after upsets by “Bohemian Rhapsody” at the Golden Globes and “Green Book” at the PGAs. Still, “A Star Is Born” didn’t do too poorly overall, with eight nominations to boot, including a Best Actor nod for Cooper. Guess the Academy just wanted to take another look at him!
In other news, it’s unusual for directors of foreign language films to be nominated, but this year there were two: Pawel Pawlikowski was recognized for “Cold War” and Alfonso Cuarón for “Roma.” “Cold War,” which premiered last year at Cannes, is a bleak yet uplifting tale of love that endures despite its circumstances. The film, tracking a Cold War-era love story, invokes gripping pathos — especially given the fact that Pawlikowski based the story loosely on his own parents. Cuarón’s “Roma,” too, tends toward the personal. In his “90 percent autobiographical” film, Cuarón displays his inimitable knack for detail, especially through naturalistic sound effects that easily immerse and orient one in the bustling Colonia Roma neighborhood, in which he spent his own childhood. However, he has proven to better employ his directing abilities, which tend toward extra dramatization, in the more action-packed “Gravity” (for which he won the Academy Award for Best Director in 2014) and 2006’s dystopian “Children of Men.” 
While the Best Director nominees traversed country borders, they failed to break the glass ceiling. Yet again, no women were nominated in the category, despite outstanding work by many female directors this year, including Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider,” Marianne Heller’s “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” and Tamara Jenkins’ “Private Life,” among others. Only five women in Oscars history have ever cinched a nomination for Best Director (and only one, Kathryn Bigelow, has ever won). Women were also shut out of the Cinematography, Editing, and Visual Effects categories this year. Despite more diverse nominees across the board, it looks as though the glass ceiling is firmly intact.
The nominees for Best Animated Feature are… “Incredibles 2,” “Isle of Dogs,” “Mirai,” “Ralph Breaks the Internet,” and “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.”
Of all the categories, this might be the most competitive. All five films were also nominated for Golden Globes, with Sony’s “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” taking home the prize. Brad Bird delivered on the quality guarantee of any Pixar film at least 10 years in the making; the meticulous and imaginative director serves a meaty, heartfelt story with plenty of charming jokes and (sometimes heavy-handed) feminist themes to boot. However, the impressive sequel, which features a villain borne of our modern-day concerns, the technology-hijacking, anonymous “Screenslaver,” doesn’t quite live up to its timeless predecessor. This nit-picking, however, is in effort to distinguish the film from its formidably creative contenders, and one would be hard-pressed to enumerate the flaws of such an enjoyable film; “Incredibles 2” became the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time.
Wes Anderson’s stop-motion-animated, heartwarming canine epic “Isle of Dogs” and the thrillingly hallucinatory, neon-inflected “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” stand out both for their experimentation with the graphic form. The four American nominees can serve as bellwethers for our cultural climate, despite their drastically different storyworlds. “Isle of Dogs” features a rabble-rousing politician who claims to speak for his people, and “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” remarkably defies the strictures of the oft-revisited Spider-Man story and its hackneyed remakes by tying culturally diverse Spider-creatures from parallel universes into its surprisingly touching story. A foray into the Wild Wild Internet, where anything is commodifiable, “Ralph Breaks the Internet” melds pop-culture references and Disney Princess cameos left and right. The film is an ambitious follow-up to its predecessor, “Wreck it Ralph,” but veers from wonderfully playful to intractably busy and dizzying. The Japanese film “Mirai” debuted to less fanfare in the United States, but has been praised for its wondrous storyworld that celebrates the magic of childhood. Despite the fierce competition, critics generally agree that “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” with its trippy, holographic illustration, is animation history in the making, and consequently, is most deserving of the Oscar.
The nominees for Best Actress are… Yalitza Aparicio (“Roma”), Glenn Close (“The Wife”), Olivia Colman (“The Favourite”), Lady Gaga (“A Star is Born”), and Melissa McCarthy (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”).
In the Best Actress category, Olivia Colman, Lady Gaga, and Glenn Close were all expected nominees — Colman for her manic performance as Queen Anne in “The Favourite,” Lady Gaga for her portrayal of an ingénue-cum-pop sensation in “A Star is Born,” and Close for her Golden Globe-awarded turn in “The Wife.”
Yalitza Aparicio is the first indigenous Mexican actress to be nominated for an Oscar. Having never acted before “Roma,” Aparicio auditioned on a whim, substituting for her pregnant sister who got cold feet at the last minute. She planned on becoming a teacher. Aparicio’s nomination is a welcome surprise, though, and a well-deserved one at that. Although her speaking time in the beautifully experiential film “Roma” is minimal, Aparicio exemplifies the artistic feat of showing without telling.
In the snub list, Emily Blunt was shut out, even though most expected a nod for her performances in “A Quiet Place” and “Mary Poppins.” It’s too bad there’s no Oscar for greatest versatility, as Blunt proved she could handle suspense and whimsicality this year with two very different bathtub scenes.
The nominees for Best Actor are… Christian Bale (“Vice”), Bradley Cooper (“A Star is Born”), Willem Dafoe (“At Eternity’s Gate”), Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”), and Viggo Mortensen (“Green Book”).
Christian Bale took home the Golden Globe for Adam McKay’s “Vice,” so it was no surprise that Bale was among the nominees for Best Actor this year. Bale is no newcomer to the Academy Awards, with previous accolades for his roles in “American Hustle,” “The Fighter,” and “The Big Short.” Bale is a famously chameleonic actor, and his interpretation of Dick Cheney is no exception: He “ballooned” in weight and spent hours in the makeup chair getting prosthetic jowls in order to play the shadowy former Vice President.
Bale deserves the win, but it wouldn’t be out of the question for Rami Malek or Bradley Cooper to take home the Best Actor award, either. Malek took home a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Freddie Mercury in “Bohemian Rhapsody” and Cooper played the gruff, seasoned musician-turned-meme in his own directorial debut, “A Star Is Born.” Would it be incorrect to say that virtually no one has talked about “At Eternity’s Gate” as an Oscars contender? And yet, Willem Dafoe slips into this year’s Best Actor lineup as a dark horse nominee for playing Vincent Van Gogh.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are… Amy Adams (“Vice”), Marina de Tavira (“Roma”), Regina King (“If Beale Street Could Talk”), Emma Stone (“The Favourite”), Rachel Weisz (“The Favourite”).
Listen, Amy Adams deserves an Oscar. What will it take? A grassroots Internet campaign? A GoFundMe? She’s gone unnoticed every time she’s been nominated (a whopping five nominations!), and for an actress of her caliber, that’s quite the travesty. Her last nomination came in 2013, for her brilliant performance as the devastating seductress of “American Hustle." Since then, she’s generally been on a roll, most recently with her wrenching performance in the HBO limited series “Sharp Objects.” It would be nice to see her win, even a symbolic victory for an accomplished career. Still, it wouldn’t be undeserved if Regina King took the statuette for her performance in “If Beale Street Could Talk,” either. The HFPA seemed to agree earlier this month.
The nominees for Best Supporting Actor are… Mahershala Ali (“Green Book”), Adam Driver (“BlacKkKlansman”), Sam Elliott (“A Star Is Born”), Richard E. Grant (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”), Sam Rockwell (“Vice”).
Mahershala Ali has had a whirlwind two years in the awards-show spotlight. After becoming the first Muslim actor to win an acting Oscar for his role as a Cuban drug dealer in the critically acclaimed and notoriously almost-snubbed “Moonlight” in 2017, he recently won the Supporting Actor Golden Globe for his role in the controversy-addled “Green Book,” and is well on track to snag his second Oscar as well. By those rankled by the insensitive behavior of Ali’s co-star, Viggo Mortensen, and by the anti-Muslim tweets of the film’s screenwriter, Nick Vallelonga, Ali is considered the saving grace of the film’s supposedly too-sanguine, “feel-good” story about a friendship that sets a paradigm for interracial harmony in the Deep South.
Surprisingly, Timothée Chalamet was excluded from the list of nominees, despite a poignant performance as a drug-addicted teenager in Felix van Groeningen’s “Beautiful Boy,” based on the memoirs of a New York Times journalist and his son. After Chalamet gained fame as the youngest Best Actor nominee in 80 years for Luca Guadagnino’s “Call Me By Your Name” last year, his snub this year is unexpected. Still, with performances in this year’s “The King” and “Little Women” in the works, Chalamet’s career is likely far from over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to fossil fuels, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has demonstrated his intention to pursue two opposing goals. He believes that Harvard can remain a leader in research on climate change, renewable energy, and environmental science while also profiting (handsomely) off oil rigs, coal mines, and fracking. Bacow’s responses to calls for Harvard to divest its nearly $40 billion endowment from fossil fuels and join the growing list of schools worldwide that have taken this bold step reveal his disappointing position.
For Bacow, Harvard’s research agenda and investment principles need not cohere and can even be contradictory. When asked about the possibility of divestment from private prisons, Bacow stated that the University should not use the endowment to “achieve political ends or particular policy ends.” He added that “there are other ways that the University tries to influence public policy through our scholarship, through our research, but we don't think that the endowment is an appropriate way to do that.” This perspective (largely shared by Bacow’s predecessor, former University President Drew G. Faust) ignores the incongruity between the arm of the University studying sea-level rise and the other arm accelerating it with reckless investments.
Guided by this mindset, perhaps it is only a matter of time before Bacow reverses Harvard’s 1990 divestment from the tobacco industry, given the Harvard School of Public Health’s research on smoking presumably serves as an adequate counter balance. Indeed, there’s still time to buy more shares in private-prison corporations, which for Bacow can be offset by Harvard’s significant scholarship on that industry’s egregious conduct. Across these cases, Harvard’s research does not absolve the University of related investments. So, why should we believe it redresses the University’s financial attachment to fossil fuels?
More recently, Bacow has gone further in his defense of Harvard’s fossil fuel investments, under an even more curious rationale. Indeed, this past December, he said, “It's also the case that if we want to bring about meaningful change — as I think we should — in trying to help create clean paths to energy, that we need to be willing to work with those organizations and institutions that are responsible for the infrastructure that literally fuels our economy.” This defense – effectively, if we can’t beat them, join them – is even worse than simply wanting a good return on the endowment, regardless of its holdings. Instead, President Bacow looks at the decades of deceit from the fossil fuel industry, such as its long-term propaganda campaign to muddy the waters on climate science and opposition to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and sees a reasonable partner.
The key organization that must change for comprehensive fossil fuel divestment is the Harvard Management Company, the University-owned subsidiary charged with growing the endowment via investments. While HMC has taken some positive steps toward divestment – including a “pause” in some natural-resource investments in 2017 – it has no explicit, enforceable ban on fossil fuel investments in place. President Bacow has remarked that divestment itself is logistically challenging. (For instance, can it still invest in car companies, which sell products that run on gasoline?) But HMC can still significantly clean its holdings now and in the future by selling its shares in any company that extracts, refines, or sells fossil fuels, as well as removing its money from commingled funds that include fossil fuel company equities and corporate bonds. An even simpler target to start with would be a ban on investments in any “carbon major” company, or one of the 100 companies that generated a whopping 71 percent of all the carbon emissions since 1988. The logistics of this challenge are a poor excuse to avoid dealing with it.
As students, faculty, and even a former member of the Board of Overseers have stated, Harvard has the opportunity to send a strong message to higher education institutions around the world that we cannot meaningfully fight climate change while investing in the industry causing it. Sadly, this is not the first time the University has lagged behind in an important divestment movement. Indeed, Harvard’s slow and inadequate divestment from South Africa during apartheid still casts a long shadow, and Bacow so far is leading the University toward an analogously shameful outcome. Still in its infancy, Bacow’s presidency has the chance to champion a sustainable future, but only if he addresses the challenge of climate change in a single, clear voice, rather than an equivocating doublespeak.

To the editor,
A recent piece by The Crimson Editorial Board criticizing the outgoing leadership of the Undergraduate Council — of which I am the former Vice President — represents a failure of adequate research.
First, the Editorial Board claims that the outgoing leadership of the UC led the Council with “persistent financial uncertainty,” citing a single article stating that the UC tapped into $6,000 of its Emergency Fund. Yet under our leadership the UC both ran a surplus on our predecessors’ budget and grew the budget we wrote. We recommended that the Finance Committee use a small fraction of the $28,692.22 Emergency and Reserve Funds to send the message that student organizations needed more funding than previous years given the 45 percent increase in grant applications over the past year. It worked. The UC earned an approximately one-third increase in budget this year. The budget upon which the Editorial Board commented was inherited from our predecessors; with our budget we were able to give full funding with no cuts to student organizations in two-thirds of our grants, which is financially unprecedented over the past five years. We also created a public budgetary reporting system for accountability which makes it surprising that the Editorial Board claims that we provided a “lack of any real accountability mechanism.” The state of UC finance under our leadership was both ideal and significantly healthier than in recent history thus highlighting a failure of research in the Editorial Board’s claims.
Second, the Editorial Board claims that the outgoing leadership of the UC has “taken credit for other, years-long initiatives which they could not have substantially impacted,” such as the educational secondary and Smith Campus Center. Not only does the Editorial Board provide no evidence for their claim of which initiatives we “could not have substantially impacted,” but they implicitly discredit our hundreds of hours of work over multiple years and our highlighting of past students’ contributions. Student organization for the Educational Studies Secondary was spearheaded over the past two years by outgoing UC President Catherine L. Zhang ’19. We wrote to the student body in an April 12 email that “after years of student advocacy, the college has approved and a new secondary field in Educational Studies [will] be launched this Fall!” Our language makes clear that this project was the result of “years of student advocacy,” not just our two years of continuous work referenced in a later email. Furthermore, in a farewell email on Nov. 29 we claimed to have “opened the Smith Campus Center nearly a decade after the UC began advocating for it.” For the Editorial Board to claim that we took full credit for this initiative given this context would imply that we worked on this project for ten years; that implication is absurd given that we were both in middle school ten years ago and highlights the lack of qualifications for their sweeping claims.  We stated that we opened the Smith Campus Center as evidenced by months of grand-opening planning meetings and our joint speech with the financial donors at the launch event. Basic research would have revealed the unfounded nature of the Editorial Board’s claims.
Third, the Editorial Board claims that the outgoing leadership of the UC performed “slow implementation one [sic] of their key campaign promises — a ‘progress bar.’” We launched the “progress bars” feature of the UC website within three months of the start of the spring semester when we took office. I coded an entire new website for the UC and worked with Harvard University Information Technology to have it installed on Harvard’s servers (which can often take years). Not only did we deliver on this promise, but we did so in the first half of our term. During the technical implementation period, we also launched a video series to transparently keep the student body updated in the interim despite the Editorial Board’s claim that we provided a “lack of any real accountability mechanism.” As the progress bars show, we began 100 percent of the things we promised and fully completed 87.7 percent. Even the slightest amount of research would have uncovered that we provided multiple platforms of detailed accountability mechanisms, had live progress bars for the majority of our term, and were successful in completing nearly nine in ten projects.
The Editorial Board should hold itself to a higher standard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We condemn the presence of the U.S. Army and Air Force Judge Advocate General Corps at the Massachusetts Law School Consortium Job Fair taking place on Harvard Law School’s campus on Jan. 28 and Jan. 29. As the Co-Presidents of Harvard Law School Lambda, the Law School’s BGLTQ student organization, we refuse to condone the government’s failure to validate the existence of transgender people.
Trump’s executive order barring transgender people from serving in the military is an unsound military policy, and the ban’s purported rationales are prejudiced and inhumane. Trump has reasoned that the military cannot support transgender service members’ alleged “tremendous medical costs and disruption,” and former Secretary of Defense James N. Mattis has rationalized that transitioning service members pose “substantial risks” to the military because they “could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that is not conducive to military effectiveness and lethality.” Such claims have been repeatedly debunked by studies and by U.S. allies who have long allowed transgender people to serve openly. And we vigorously reject the bigoted accusation that current and former service members who have put their lives at risk to defend this country, such as Logan and Laila Ireland, Kristin Beck, and Sage Fox, are a “burden” in any way. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court lifted two of the nationwide injunctions that federal courts had placed on the ban, potentially allowing the ban to go into effect. The Court’s decision has rendered the future of transgender service members endangered and uncertain.
We adopt the example of the many Law School students who protested JAG’s presence on our campus during the era of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” Like many law schools, Harvard Law School has an employer non-discrimination policy that explicitly prohibits organizations that discriminate against the BGLTQ community from conducting recruitment activities on campus. This policy conflicts with the Solomon Amendment, a statute that bars federal aid to universities that prevent military recruitment on campus. Under DADT, JAG violated the Law School’s non-discriminatory policy by refusing to hire “out” BGLTQ students. However, because the Supreme Court ruled in Rumsfeld v. FAIR that the Solomon Amendment does not violate the First Amendment’s free speech guarantees, the Law School administration was unable to bar JAG from recruiting on the Law School’s campus.
Despite the ruling, some professors, including then-Law School Dean Elena Kagan, and many Law School students utilized various tools of resistance to protest DADT. Notably, members of HLS Lambda signed up for interview slots with JAG and outed themselves during their interviews in an act of defiance. Their tireless resistance only ceased when DADT was repealed in 2010. Today, we pick up where the previous generation of Law School students left off by continuing to oppose any attempt to discriminate against members of the BGLTQ community on Harvard Law School’s campus.
The trans ban is only one of several ways in which the Trump-Pence administration’s attempts to marginalize the BGLTQ community and specifically trans people. The Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX that would minimize protections for transgender people under federal civil rights law and is rolling back regulations affirming transgender people’s right to access healthcare without discrimination. The Departments of Education and Justice rescinded a guidance that clarified trans students’ right to equal access to education, turning a blind eye to widespread anti-trans discrimination in schools. The president’s religious liberty executive order and the Department of Justice’s religious liberty task force have placed cross hairs on marriage equality and discrimination against BGLTQ employees. The Department of Justice sided with the baker who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple, denigrating the experience of all BGLTQ individuals who lack equal treatment under the law. That baker is now refusing to serve transgender people. By removing all mention of BGLTQ people from the White House website and from the upcoming census, the president is attempting to erase us and our relevance. The trans ban is one piece of the administration’s extraordinarily complex, oppressive machine of discrimination against the BGLTQ community, and the onus is on us to fight back against any anti-trans policies that reach Harvard’s shores.
We at Lambda have been pleasantly surprised by the support that we have found among the wider Harvard community for transgender rights, with Harvard students attending our phone banks for “Yes on 3” and attending our rally for transgender rights in the fall. We may not be able to stop JAG from coming to the Law School because of the Solomon Amendment, but we can all do more to resist the marginalization of transgender people here at Harvard and in the wider Boston community. The Harvard community will continue to show our opposition to the trans military ban through protests on Jan. 29., and trans students always have a safe space in our Quoffice in Hastings Hall.
Harvard students: Do not be complicit in the administration’s denial of civil rights from a group that has long been unrecognized and disrespected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Ph.D. student and two former lawyers — all unaffiliated with Harvard — filed a Title IX complaint with the United States Department of Education, alleging the University had created “a hostile environment against men.”
The complaint — which, if opened for investigation, would join three ongoing probes into Harvard’s Title IX compliance — was filed with the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, according to its authors. The complainants contend that, by maintaining ties with the American Psychological Association, Harvard is endorsing the APA’s new guidelines on the potential harm of “traditional masculinity,” and therefore discriminating against men.
The complaint suggests that the APA revise its guidelines or that Harvard eliminate its relationship with the APA.
The original authors of the undated complaint are Kursat Christoff Pekgoz, who said he is a PhD candidate at the University of Southern California; John Davis, who said he is a lawyer affiliated with the Perses Institute; and James Preston, who is an inactive member of the Washington, D.C. bar. A version of the complaint available on Pekgoz’s personal website as of Tuesday evening omits the two lawyers’ names. None of the authors have direct ties to Harvard.
This is not the first Title IX complaint Pekgoz has filed — last year he leveled a complaint against Yale University with OCR, prompting an investigation into the school’s single-gender programs and scholarships specifically benefitting women. Pekgoz also filed a similar complaint against the University of Southern California. OCR later opened up an investigation into allegations of discrimination against men by USC. None of the resulting investigations have concluded.
Pekgoz has also filed complaints against Georgetown University and Northeastern University, according to his website.
The complaint against Harvard is not currently listed on the Department of Education’s website as an open investigation; the website was last updated Dec. 28, 2018. Harvard also has not received official word of the complaint yet, according to University spokesperson Jonathan Swain.
When asked to confirm whether the complaint had been filed, a spokesperson for the Department of Education wrote in an emailed statement that OCR does not acknowledge complaints unless or until they have been accepted for investigation.
In the meantime, both Pekgoz and Davis said they remain committed to their belief that the APA guidelines are harmful to male students.
“When we read the recently published guidelines, it was clear to us that the ‘guidelines’ represent a pervasive set of ideological distortions among psychologists,” Davis wrote in an emailed statement. “We believe those ideological distortions result from misandry and hostility towards men and boys.”
Pekgoz agreed, noting that he is specifically concerned by what he said was the APA’s “attempt to classify masculinity as a form of mental illness.” He also wrote that Harvard psychology professor Steven Pinker has criticized the APA guidelines and that Pinker’s critique was “consistent” with the reasoning behind the complaint.
Pinker — who said he is a fellow of the APA — wrote in an emailed statement that he has not had any contact with the complaint’s authors.
“If there’s specific evidence that Harvard discriminates against men, that has to be taken seriously, but the new report and its silly statements are a red herring,” he wrote, referring to the APA’s new guidelines. He added that Harvard’s ties to the APA are “completely irrelevant.”
“You can’t have psychologists or a psychology department without ties to the APA,” Pinker wrote.
Anyone may file a Title IX complaint with the Office for Civil Rights, regardless of whether or not they themselves are a victim of the alleged discrimination. OCR then determines whether or not it has the legal authority — and sufficient information — to open an investigation.
Colby Bruno, senior counsel with the Victim Rights Law Center, described the complaint as “once or twice removed” from the original intent and reach of Title IX.
“It sounds more to me like they have a problem with the APA, and I’m not sure that would go anywhere,” she said.
Bruno also noted the current administration has sought to narrow the scope of Title IX and raise the standard for making claims of sexual harassment.
“Maybe this wasn’t the best time to file it,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor and constitutional law expert Vicki C. Jackson will serve as the next president of the Association of American Law Schools, the organization announced earlier this month.
The non-profit association, founded in 1900, counts 179 law schools nationwide as members — schools that “enroll most of the nation’s law students and produce the majority of the country’s lawyers and judges, as well as many of its lawmakers” according to the organization’s website. The group inducted Jackson as its president at a January meeting in New Orleans.
Jackson joined the Law School's faculty in 2011, where she was appointed the first Thurgood Marshall Professor of Constitutional Law. She was previously a faculty member at the Georgetown University Law Center.
Jackson wrote in an email that, as AALS president, she hopes to utilize her expertise in constitutional law to address the challenges that legal scholarship faces.
“My scholarship includes work on both U.S. constitutional law and comparative constitutional law, a background that should help me give voice both to the challenges facing constitutional democracy and to what legal education is doing and can do to strengthen constitutional democracy,” she wrote.
Former Dean of the Law School and current University Professor Martha L. Minow, who served as chair of the AALS Deans Steering Committee from 2013 to 2015, praised the group’s choice of Jackson as president in an emailed statement.
“Professor Jackson brings deep and extensive knowledge about law, legal institutions, and legal education not only in the United States, but also across the globe,” she wrote. “Her talents as a teacher, experiences in curricular innovation, collaborative leadership style, and understanding of this key moment for the rule of law around the globe bring great strengths to this organization of law schools.”
This year will be the first in AALS's 119-year history that women hold all three major executive offices, President, Immediate Past-President and President-Elect — a development Jackson wrote provides an opportunity for legal scholarship to become more diverse and inclusive.
“Having all of these offices held by women is a visible symbol that may inspire others to seek such leadership roles, to overcome barriers to women’s advancement that persist, and to look carefully at how their institution’s practices can be changed to promote more genuinely open and inclusive paths to leadership,” Jackson wrote.
Minow wrote she believes Jackson’s leadership in particular will help promote diversity in the field.
“Because of her strong commitments to and track-record of support for diversity among faculty, staff, and students, because of her own experiences in government and in private practice, and because of her deep wisdom, the legal academy is lucky to have the benefits of her leadership,” Minow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student research assistants at Harvard Law School received their first pay raise in more than a decade this month thanks to a Massachusetts minimum wage law that took effect earlier this month.
Those law students are some of the 742 student workers throughout the University who received raises when the state minimum wage rose from $11 to $12 per hour starting Jan. 1.
The Massachusetts State Legislature passed the bill — termed the “grand bargain bill” — in June 2018. The bill increased the minimum wage to $12 starting at the beginning of 2019 and will gradually raise the minimum hourly pay to $15 by 2023.
Before the “grand bargain bill,” the hourly wage given to all Law School research assistants had stagnated at $11.50 since at least 2008, according to publicly available documents on the Law School website. That pay marked a lower hourly rate than the average wage earned by graduate research assistants — $16.50 — and the average hourly pay given to undergraduate research assistants — $13.50 — according to the Student Employment Office website.
Though the law triggered a pay increase for 742 student employees across the University, some workers did not receive a raise as a result of the legislation. Harvard’s other 6,983 student workers already made at least that much per hour, so the law did not affect their salaries, University spokesperson Jonathan Swain wrote in an email.
Some of the students who received wage increases because of the law, however, said they do not think the Law School did enough to secure adequate wages for them.
Yaacov “Jake” Meiseles, an law student research assistant and organizer for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers — a union comprising undergraduate and graduate teaching and research assistants — said he finds it concerning that the Law School continues to pay student research assistants the minimum amount allowed under the law.
“Research assistants are helping professors in writing massively influential books and law review articles and working on important cases and filing lawsuits," Meiseles said. "The fact that Harvard seems to value that at whatever the minimum the state is allowing them to get away with is deeply troubling."
Alexandra “Vail” Kohnert-Yount, another law student research assistant and union organizer, said the wages the school pays its student workers are not high enough to give them “a chance” to reduce their debt.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson declined to respond to questions about the specifics of the Law School wage increase, citing ongoing contract negotiations between Harvard and the graduate union.
“With the certification of HGSU-UAW as the representative of HLS research and teaching assistants, wage rates are now part of the ongoing negotiations between the University and the union,” Jackson wrote. “HLS continues to respect and await the outcome of that process.”
Representatives from the University and the union have met every two weeks since October to negotiate a contract for the union’s members. Experts say the negotiation process could stretch on for months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Braving strong winds and frigid temperatures, more than two thousand Cambridge residents descended on City Hall and Central Square Monday for Cambridge’s annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service.
Event attendees made fleece scarves and blankets for homeless and low-income people in Cambridge; sorted food and winter clothing donations; and crafted valentines for seniors, veterans, and active military overseas. By the end of the day, volunteers had made more than 3,000 valentines, collected more than 1,000 pounds of winter clothing, sewn more than 600 scarves and blankets, and delivered nearly 350 bags of groceries to 18 local food pantries.
Many Helping Hands 365 — a Cambridge group dedicated to mobilizing volunteers and facilitating service opportunities — organized the event, which the organization has coordinated every year since 2010. The Cambridge Day of Service is one of the largest community service events in New England, according to the group’s website.
“It’s a unique opportunity for neighbors to work side by side to accomplish something for those in need,” the website reads.
Volunteer organizer Amy S. Bamforth, a social worker who said she has helped coordinate the Day of Service since the event began, oversaw volunteers who made scarves and blankets for the homeless and families in need.
“I just think it’s important to help out other folks, and I think sometimes people don’t realize how much privilege each of us have,” Bamforth said.
The Day of Service also drew some University affiliates, and several Harvard students helped organize the event.
Ed D. F. Aubry, a Harvard Kennedy School student who served as a volunteer coordinator, said he wanted to “help on a day that’s important to America.”
“I’m not from here, so it’s a great way to get involved in what’s going on in Cambridge,” he said.
Reverend Ellis I. Washington, another volunteer in attendance, also decided to participate in the event as a way of honoring King’s memory. He said the best way to pay tribute to King’s “life dedicated to service” is to help those in need.
Though Washington was initially supposed to deliver a speech about King’s legacy in front of City Hall, event organizers decided to cancel his remarks because of the sub-freezing temperature.
Josephine T. Mullen, a Cambridge resident and a first time participant in the event, said the Day of Service offered her an opportunity to become more involved in her community.
“I’ve always wanted to come,” she said.
The Day of Service also drew one particularly high-profile Cambridge resident: United States Senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren attended the event and spoke with volunteers and organizers alike.
Both attendees and coordinators said the event marked an important chance to participate in community service.
“Any opportunity to come out and just join with other people across the community and do acts of kindness, acts of service, is inspiring,” Washington said. “It’s something we ought to do more than once a year, but this is certainly a great opportunity to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This season, the Harvard women’s rugby team has proven it deserves attention. The program has continuously been among the best in the NCAA, and its 2018 campaign showed no change. The program’s greatness only becomes more impressive when the difficulty in recruiting high school rugby players and walk-ons is considered.
Harvard’s recruitment of high school rugby players is a complex process. Primarily, since rugby is not exactly an established and common sport for kids to grow up playing, the sheer number of high school players is much smaller compared to other sports, such as soccer or basketball. In addition, the players must be strong academically to be accepted into Harvard.
“The recruiting process is really about finding the right people who are a good fit for Harvard and for our team culture,” Coach Mel Denham remarked. “Ultimately, we cast a large net in order to find the people who want to be at Harvard and who would be a great fit on and off the field.”
The coaching staff scouts all over the world to identify top talent. High schools in California, Utah, Colorado, and some midwest states are regularly scouted, in addition to Canada. The coaching staff is also developing relationships with high schools around the world to find great rugby players.
“We have also started to work with some English players and are in the process of building relationships with coaches in England, New Zealand and Australia as well,” reported Coach Denham. “Our current team has players from Scotland, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, China, Germany and Honduras which is incredible to have such diversity in our culture.”
The team also heavily relies on walk-ons to contribute to the team’s success.
“We try to be really welcoming to walk-ons because they are an integral part of our team,” said senior Akweley Okine. “Without them, we would not have enough people to play.”
This recruitment of walk-ons consists of multiple challenges for the coach and for the players, including the NCAA clearance process. The NCAA clearance process is time-consuming, complex and at times, discouraging. The team uniquely has a “recruitment chair” whose job is first to convince Harvard students to join rugby, and second to help with the logistics of the NCAA clearance process. Coach Denham suggests this position is incredibly helpful for the success of walk-ons in this process.
“We are very lucky to have incredible recruiting chairs on the team who have carved out a detailed timeline from start to finish for walk-on recruiting, which has helped make this clearance process very efficient,” said Coach Denham.
The tryout process for walk-ons differs from other varsity sports. Because the team needs walk-ons to field enough players, the coach looks for crossover athletes.
“Rugby is such an incredible opportunity for cross-over athletes, who weren’t exposed to the sport in high school, to compete and excel,” said Coach Dunham. “A lot of times skill will transfer from other sports they have played which is always fun to see.”
Since the team looks for these athletes, the focus is more on athletic ability and competitiveness as opposed to particular rugby skills. Furthermore, Coach Denham looks for players who will fit into the rugby team’s culture. The specific skills of rugby can be taught, but the ability to be competitive as well as a good teammate is most important.
“We bring on the athletes who we believe have the ability to develop in rugby, excel at the varsity level, and thrive within our team culture,” Coach Denham indicated. The rugby-specific trial process for crossover athletes allows the coach to “identify the athletes who are committed to the learning process and have shown athleticism and/or enough crossover skill to develop quickly.”
However, Coach Denham views the initial skill discrepancy for crossover athletes as the second biggest challenge in walk-on recruitment. Similar to the job of the recruitment chair, returning players are expected to play a role in reducing this challenge. Understandably, Coach Denham believes the early stages of becoming a rugby player for crossover athletes can be discouraging, so the advanced, experienced players are called on to offer support.
“Our experienced players also help tremendously,” said the Coach. “We often see them working with walk-ons pre- and post- practice to help get them up to speed. Injured players will also help by taking walk-ons aside during intense and advanced training sessions to work on fundamentals.”
For walk-on Erica Jarrell, the team’s commitment to helping her understand the game made her feel welcomed and appreciated.
“They were just super welcoming and everyone was down to teach me the game which was so nice,” she shared. “I really never felt isolated.”
The team creates a culture that is inviting and exciting, but as an intense, demanding, varsity contact sport, rugby is incredibly physically and mentally taxing.
Senior Caitlin Weigel explained the difficulty in finding women who have the “willingness to put their body on the line.” However, the physicality of rugby does not phase her. She works to convince potential walk-ons that joining rugby will only enhance their college experience and not limit the opportunities Harvard has to offer.
Perhaps the team’s extensive focus on creating an inviting atmosphere for recruits and walk-ons contributes to the team’s success. The emphasis on team chemistry was clear from the beginning of this fall season.
The team traveled to Canada during pre-season and the players were able to get to know one another off the field.
“I think it was really helpful in terms of solidifying better team potential,” said Okine. “Spending a lot of time together, starting to gel and understand each other better as players and people while we were in Canada was really incredible.”
The team also bonded through mindfulness practices early on in their season.
“I think we felt super united this season…we did a whole bunch of mindfulness work at the beginning of the season,” said Jarrell. “At the time we thought it was the most painful thing ever...but we employed all of the skills throughout the season and even throughout exams and the hardest academic stress time we maintained our team unity.”
Okine agreed with her teammate.
“I think a lot of people hit that stride in figuring out what they need to do to be the best teammates they can be, whether that is from the sidelines because they are injured or on the field hyping everyone up,” said Okine. “I feel that was at a level that we have not really been at in a long time.”
The bond between the players off the field clearly carried over into the rugby season as many players were expected to step up into new positions due to injuries and lack of personnel.
“We had walk-ons who were suddenly starters because someone got injured...and they were able to deliver some really key performances for us,” said senior Caitlin Weigel. “That ability to adapt to new positions and new expectations and grow in those positions really helped fuel us throughout this season, especially in the postseason where we really excelled.”
The team indeed excelled in the postseason. Its historic season culminated in the team’s first ever appearance in the NIRA National Championship in November. Though the game ended in a heartbreaking 14-19 loss to Dartmouth, they had beat the Big Green earlier in the season in the Ivy League Championship,12-3. This win was ultimate highlight of their season.
“I think obviously the best part of the season was beating Dartmouth in the Ivy League championship,” said Okine. “For the past four years, it has been something we’ve wanted to do and we’ve always come up short. I think all of that history and the really hard losses over the last four years culminated in that and it was just a very incredible moment.”
Both Okine and Weigel described the night before the big win in the Ivy League Championship as a very special memory. It was another symbol of the team’s strong chemistry and love for one another.
“We were all in the locker room just blasting music and we had a huge dance party,” said Weigel. “You could look around at everyone’s face and there was just such joy and love. That really defines what this team has meant to me.”
The joy and love was obvious to Okine as well. For her, it was a moment of unity and trust.
“I just remember looking around and being like, ‘this is incredible,’’’ said Okine. “We’re dancing around, we’re about to play this huge game, but we’re just enjoying being with each other and getting hyped for each other. I just remember thinking at that moment, ‘we are going to win, there is no way we are not going to win.’”

WASHINGTON D.C., — Ever since the dawn of the 2018-2019 campaign, there has been an underlying aura of impatience at Harvard men’s basketball games, home and away.
“When is Bryce coming back? What about Seth?”
These were not just rumblings in the stands. When asked about the timetables of arguably this program’s two most talented players in presser after presser, coach Tommy Amaker’s answers remained the same from preseason through early January.
“Out indefinitely.”
“I don’t know.”
“No timetable.”
“When they’re ready.”
As non-committal as these answers were, one merely had to arrive a tad early to Crimson games (or stay postgame in some occasions) to sense that the return — especially for Aiken — was fast approaching. In warmup gear, Aiken moved swiftly through drills. Elevated for layups. Knocked down shot after shot.
To put it briefly, Bryce was finally ready.

Fast forward to the present — Martin Luther King Day, 2019. In the frigid, breathless D.C. air, a usually bustling metropolis was at a standstill both by the holiday and month-long government shutdown.
Inside the Burr Gymnasium on the campus of Howard University, though, was a scene atypical of the dullness and inactivity of the city.
For starters, Howard alum and current U.S. junior senator Kamala Harris had that morning announced her bid for the 2020 presidency. In paying tribute to the very location where she first ran for office as a freshman class representative, Harris fittingly chose the Harvard-Howard game at Burr for her first large public appearance as 2020 candidate.
Beyond the buzz on the sidelines, there was something equally as palpable on the hardwood, at least for the strong Crimson contingency at the game.
After dressing but not playing in Harvard’s Ivy opener loss on Jan. 12 to Dartmouth, Bryce Aiken would make his junior season debut. It was 348 days ago to the date since he went down in agony in Morningside Heights as the Crimson suffered a rare loss to the Columbia Lions, clutching a left knee that would require offseason surgery.
For someone whose bread-and-butter had been the craftiness to maneuver around defenders, Aiken was left with no choice but to go through the humbling, monotonous, and slow path to recovery.
Rehab session after rehab session, the Randolph, NJ native paid his dues and went through the “grind”. Usually very vociferous on social media, Aiken posted less frequently but provided encouraging updates on occasion.
In mid-May, for example, Bryce uploaded a video on Instagram jogging on the anti-gravity treadmill at Harvard, his first time since his surgery two months prior. In the caption, he commented, “It’s the little things that make the journey so beautiful…I’m feeling super super blessed!”
Alongside keeping up his work with the athletic training staff, Harvard strength coaches played an instrumental role in pushing his confidence forward. Bryan Doo, a former strength coach with the Boston Celtics, was an important mentor to Aiken during his recovery.
“I think our role with Bryce is giving him confidence on ‘Hey this can happen, but that’s okay.’” Doo said last season. “Give him the preparation when you do this [rehab], the work, this is what you are going to feel, don’t be afraid of that. That’s nothing new.”
When asked about the journey back, Aiken let out a sigh of relief before giving a brief reflection.
“That’s a long answer,” Aiken said. “But the short answer, just got to stay tough and be patient. Keep working for each and every day, take it one step at a time and just persevere through it all. Stay positive.”
These mantras carried him through his recovery, and now it was time to pay off the dividends.

Coach Amaker had no hesitancies about making a statement of confidence in Bryce. In the past, the Harvard coach sent symbolic messages to the team through who he started — one may recall his decision last year against BU to remove all of his usual starters from the opening lineup.
After Harvard and Howard locked arms in pregame as the Gospel Choir of Harlem honored Martin Luther King Jr, it was Aiken who took off his warmups first. Yes, there would be no adjustment period. Bryce was back, and he was in.
It only took 16 seconds for the point guard — whom Coach Amaker last season pronounced the team’s best player — to declare his return.
Off a high perimeter feed from classmate big Rob Baker, Aiken received the ball at the upper-left arc and calmly swished the triple. As the bench rose in elation, Bryce looked down, pounded his chest twice, and backpedaled confidently back the other way.
Things settled down from there, but Aiken would stay hungry on the perimeter. In the opening minutes, Bryce never ventured far beyond the arc as the Crimson moved the ball from one side to another at will.
Aiken quickly tallied his first dish of the afternoon, locating combo guard partner Christian Juzang in the left corner for the trey in Harvard’s third possession. This Aiken-Juzang pairing was a rarity before Bryce’s injury last season, but noticeably brought about improved court spacing and dynamic movement on the offensive end.
“I actually used to play two guards in high school and coming back to it was a good experience,” Aiken said. “It gives me an opportunity to get off the ball a little bit and [defensively] switch which we will definitely get better at.”
On the other end, Aiken was matched up with lanky junior guard Charles “CJ” Williams. This was not the easiest of opening-game matchups, as the 6-foot-5 Bison had a much longer wingspan than the 6-foot-0 Crimson guard.
Williams quickly drew a fast-break foul on Aiken at the 17:30 mark and Howard coach Kevin Nickelberry would continue to try to exploit the mismatch, drawing isolation plays for taller Bison guards in the left baseline against Aiken throughout the contest.
Back on offense, Bryce continued to make an impact even without scoring. Now, positioned on the left corner, Aiken ran consecutive plays in which he wrapped around to the front of the arc or cut back to the corner. The first set landed in a Baker three to extend an early 9-2 lead, while another resulted in an open-but-missed baseline triple for Aiken.
Amaker kept his guard in for the first six minutes, and right before hitting the bench Aiken completed an efficient transition lay-up, accelerating ahead of the pack before curling it in on the other side. By then, the Crimson had jumped out to a 15-7 lead.
The freshman year Aiken, with the flair to break ankles on every possession or make Derrick Rose-like drives to the paint wasn’t completely there. But as classmate Justin Bassey commented, there was a noticeable increase in offensive creativity and pace to the team with #11 on the court.
“What he brings in terms of not just on-the-court stats and the ability to score, but also just energy, enthusiasm, and the way he carries himself,” Bassey said. “That does a lot more beyond pointing what’s up for us. Having Bryce back is a huge game changer for us.”
Amaker gave Aiken three more minutes on the half, balancing time with his now abundance of guards including Juzang, sophomore Rio Haskett, as well as freshmen Spencer Freedman and Noah Kirkwood. On the sidelines, Aiken stood in the corner rather than take a seat on the bench, engaged and ready to go back in at moment’s notice.
In that short span of time before the end of the first frame, Amaker edged his point guard to be more aggressive. On the sidelines, Coach pleaded with Aiken to “shoot the ball!” particularly with the Bisons operating a 3-2 zone that left open opportunities in the corners.
Aiken responded with increased fervor and intensity. On a fast-break drive at the nine-minute mark, Bryce pushed the ball downhill and drew the foul inside over two Bison defenders. Rather than operating from the corner, Aiken came back to the top and began to generate playmaking opportunities of his own. Twice, he located Bassey for triples after cutting inside— the second which brought the Crimson lead to 26-19 at 7:23.
At halftime, Bryce had a respectable six points, three assists, and two fouls as his team led 45-31. After the statement three to start the contest, Aiken was unable to connect on three more opportunities from deep.

Whatever was said in that locker room, even with the large margin, seemed to catalyze the team to initiate the half. CJ Williams of the Bisons attacked the basket but was smothered by Chris Lewis. Immediately, Aiken called for the ball and located a streaking Baker. And bang! Baker vaulted into the air to finish the alley-oop.
That budding chemistry of the first half between Aiken and Baker — the latter who finished with a double-double, will certainly be something to watch. Baker finished another dunk followed by one from Lewis. This looked like the opposite of the first frame, as the Crimson sought opportunities inside rather than outside.
Aiken was now also guarded defensively by 6-foot-1 sophomore guard RJ Cole, a fellow New Jerseyan. With a smaller defender, Aiken began to capitalize on a newfound offense aggressiveness. Despite some setbacks including two turnovers while driving inside, Aiken fearlessly attacked the basket while showing greater consistency on the outside.
Still, Bryce did not back down from three. His most memorable of the night came with just six minutes left in the game. The Bisons had gnawed at the Crimson’s double-digit lead for most of the game, but it still stood around 9-12 points.
In what could be only described as a dagger, Aiken nailed a step-back three at the end of the shot clock with Cole in his face. If this was not a bit of old Bryce, then there is little other evidence. One of the commentators said in steadfast fashion, “That’s dangerous.” The other commentator, let out a “Wooo…haha.”
Oh, and it is also worth mentioning that Bryce played all 20 minutes of the second half. Yep, this did not look like a player in need of a minutes restriction.
Final stat line for Bryce on the night: 16 points, 29 minutes. 4-of-10 from the field, 3-for-7 from three. 2 turnovers, 3 personal fouls. Coupled with a team-high 5 assists, about as well of a debut as the team could expect.

Postgame, when asked about Bryce’s performance, Amaker made sure to temper his enthusiasm.
“He can play better,” Amaker said. “I’ve seen him play a lot better. But for his first time back, it’s really neat to see him back on the court.”
It has felt like an eternity for the team to even hear the words “back on the court” associated with Bryce Aiken. With partner-in-crime Seth Towns’ return looming in the near future (again no official word from the team), the spark that is brought with these two players is undeniable to a team that Amaker noted “should be a little better than what we are right now.”
That said, the Ivy season has already started. With a healthy Bryce, this begins an exciting new chapter in the season for the Crimson, one in which his services have been sorely missed.
Let the Ancient Eight madness begin.

It seems as though faculty would be used to receiving questionable emails at this point — after all, we’ve all written our fair share of late night, sleep deprived pleas for extensions. However, it seems as though the senders of these odd exchanges aren’t limited to students. Apparently, Bridget Terry Long — the dean of Harvard Graduate School of Education — was the latest Harvard figure to try to scam University faculty members.
Last week, Harvard Kennedy School professor Joshua S. Goodman ’00 received an email from a Gmail account claiming to be Long:
The two question marks really makes it seem urgent (and really gives off “I’m the Dean of the GSE” vibes). Well-played, “Dean Long.”
Seeing that the email came from a Gmail account, Goodman wanted to “play it cool.”
Good effort, Professor Goodman, but if the combination of “Yes” and “what’s up?” gives off any “play it cool” vibe, it’s my grandpa’s.
“Dean Long” told Goodman she was “in a meeting” and couldn’t use her phone. She needed Goodman to get her an Amazon gift card from the store immediately!
Goodman played along for a while, and even asked “Dean Long” to verify her identity by telling him a very specific piece of academic information.
To be honest, playing the “look how smart I am, I’m a Harvard professor” card on a scammer is just kind of sad. I’m starting to wish the scammer had actually succeeded.
Regardless, Goodman eventually informed the phisher that he knew this was a scam and that he would be keeping the $500 worth of gift cards for himself. What did he spend it on? Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches? Academic studies to flaunt? Give us some more ideas in the comments.
But the phisher was persistent and kept up the act. Twenty-six hours later and “Dean Long” was apparently STILL stuck in a meeting…on a Saturday. Is the academic life really THAT tough?
After a meeting that lasted 24 hours, $500 spent on gift cards, and the flexing of academic muscles on an email scammer, “Dean Long” finally stopped writing.
As for (the actual) Dean Long herself, she responded on Twitter by reassuring the world that the emails were not from her and that it was, in fact, a scammer.
Long joins a group of illustrious faculty members — including former University President Drew “Pay Me Money to Speak at Commencement” Faust — who have been impersonated by scammers looking to swindle academics for their money. We hope she enjoys this distinct honor.
