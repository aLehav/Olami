On Feb. 22 at Paine Hall, the Harvard Composers Association presented “New Works,” a concert in collaboration with the Juventas New Music Ensemble premiering original pieces from undergraduate classical composers. The six selected Harvard composers were Amir Bitran ‘16, Maxwell P. Phillips ‘15, Andre T. Nguyen ‘16, Jake H. Wilder-Smith ‘16, Sam Wu ‘17 and Alexander B. Zaloum ‘16. A short 45-minute concert, the event was run with the help of Juventas Ensemble artistic director Lidiya Yankovskaya and managing director Tammy Lynch.
 
Wu, who hails from China, premiered “Callisto,” a piece meant to depict the Jovian moon. He was inspired to write about this piece after watching “2001: A Space Odyssey” and calls it a “light-hearted, fun piece” in contrast to his usual compositions. “Callisto” definitely fits this description, opening with a decorous flute and clarinet melody with short marcato notes by the cello underneath. In the concert’s program, Wu writes that the various colors and textures attempt “to paint an impression of the cratered surface of the moon.” Although without the same grandiosity as “The Planets” by Holst [FC], it depicts a “lighter” version of outer space. Wu succeeds in presenting the smaller moon orbiting around Holst’s “Jupiter.”
 
 “Imagine a little duckling waltzing alone,” Nguyen says about his piece “Waltzing Duckling,” a short piece for flute, violin and cello. The title evokes a dolce, whimsical song filled with short,  rhythmic notes, but the actual composition sounds nostalgic and borderline sad. This duckling dances alone to a waltz that is usually danced in pairs. “People at Harvard care more about intellectual musical beauty than aesthetic musical beauty. I don’t care whether my music is intellectual or not,” Nguyen says. Nguyen, an applied math concentrator, says the music he dislikes most is atonal music composed using mathematical algorithms. “Math is beautiful and music is beautiful but it’s like milk tastes good and orange juice tastes good. If you make a really good combination it might taste good, but most of the time you wouldn’t want to mix the two.”
 
Nguyen’s ideals of aesthetic beauty are taken to an extreme by Zaloum’s most developed composition to date, “Never Forgotten,” a piece for piano, cello, and violin. Zaloum began writing music in 7th grade for a school contest and is now in his eighth year of composing . “I gave the piece a title because you have to give it a title, but I didn’t have something in mind when I was composing the piece,” he says. “If I had to say, though, it’s like a journey. It starts with a pain or tragedy of some sort development is dealing with that pain then climax in the cry out to that surrender.” The climax, which Zaloum claims is the highlight of the piece, is a loud outburst from the violin and piano with the cello playing long notes underneath it, followed by a transition into a happier, lighter section. This piece was the easiest to follow of the six in the program—perhaps bordering on too accessible—with a melody suitable for a dramatic scene of a Hollywood movie.
 
The finale of the concert was a three-movement piece by Bitran, although only two movements were performed during the concert. Trained as a classical pianist, Bitran began composing in 2005. The driving force behind his artistic impulse is his American, Jewish, and Latin-American heritage, as well as his musical family background. The first movement, “Rhapsody,” is mainly based on a pair of melodies Bitran created in 2008; the two fantastical, folkloric, mystical melodies are put in complex contexts such as instances when the pianist strikes the piano strings with her hand and uses unusual time signatures. The second movement, “Night Music” evolves from a lullaby-like rocking rhythm accompanying a singing melody. “The piece is not yet finished,” Bitran says, “There will be a third movement soon.” In the future, Bitran will be composing a piece for the Collegium, where he now sings, and his selected orchestral work “Kedushah” will be recorded by the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra.
 
When asked to finish the sentence “composing is…,” each of the composers pauses for at least three minutes. After shaking his head and laughing nervously at the stress of capturing the perfect answer, Zaloum responds, “composing is sharing a piece of my soul.” Unravelling musical excerpts simply from ideas that float in their heads, these composers share an intimate picture, their personal reflection of the world.

Beck is 43 years old. This is a difficult age for rock stars, making them tend towards silliness and self-doubt: by his own admission, David Bowie hit his lowest point musically at the age of 40; The Who’s early-eighties breakup and The Rolling Stones’ internal strife date to roughly this point in the musicians’ lives. Ultimately, the difficulty facing middle-aged rock artists is in reconciling their own senescence with a genre that worships youth.
 
In Beck’s case, the process is complicated, if not exactly retarded, by the anti-folk hero’s traditionally moody affect and mature vocals. It is difficult for him to become more serious, since the universally acclaimed 2002 album “Sea Change” was the last word on seriousness and, in all honesty, existential gloom. On the other hand, attempting to be either more light-hearted or more avant-garde would both betray his sound and smack of an incipient mid-life crisis. His new album, “Morning Phase,” while successfully avoiding these obvious pitfalls, stumbles in a different way—it simply never becomes interesting.
 
The problem arises from the fact that nearly every song on the album fails to distinguish itself from the rest. The production is impeccable, but the composition ultimately lacks melodically. The arrangements of both the instrumentals and the backing chorus are strikingly reminiscent of The Moody Blues’ work—particularly 1970’s “A Question of Balance”—but while the ethereal strings and Mellotron of that album are grounded by aggressive guitar work and truly haunting tunes, “Morning Phase” has the feeling of incidental music—symphonic backgrounds lacking a foreground. Admittedly, strong riffs have never exactly been Beck’s modus operandi. Nevertheless, in prior albums, he occasionally allowed his arrangements to fall back, revealing the primary motifs unhampered and avoiding the sense that every song lacks development; on the other hand, in this new effort, the arrangements mask rather than enhance the individual songs.
 
The pathology begins with a soaring orchestral introduction, “Cycle,” that segues into the first song, “Morning.” Beck has at least had the good sense to put his best foot forward—“Morning” is, in itself, a lovely piece, with some genuinely affecting resolutions. However, it is followed by its sonic imitator, the lyrically insipid “Heart Is a Drum,” which is, in turn, followed by its sonic imitator, “Say Goodbye,” which is only slightly distinguished from the rest of the album by its immature, hackneyed, blue-eyed-soul rhythmic shamble. The rest of the album sadly follows this trend, each song taking up the torch of the jejune in its turn—some feature a dark synth in the opening bars (“Unforgiven”), some begin with cellos rather than violins (“Wave”), but almost all resolve into airy strings and V7-I progressions.
 
Perhaps the only song that entirely escapes this indistinguishable haze is “Turn Away,” in which Beck deigns to throw the listener a bone in the form of an up-tempo song with a hummable melody line and a strong rhythm-guitar. “Turn Away” very much fits into the rest of the album’s sound with its lush orchestral backing; however, its strong melodic structure saves it from the oblivion to which the rest of “Morning Phase” is consigned. Unfortunately, its position near the end of the album only emphasizes how dull the previous 10 songs were by comparison.
 
Similarly, while the final track, “Waking Light,” mainly falls in with the rest of the songs on the album, it rubs in the listeners’ faces (or ears) the vapidity to which they have just been subjected; as the song approaches its conclusion, a brash, vivid synth line leaps over the background, electrifying the piece—for its final 20 seconds. It is perhaps the saddest coda imaginable on the morass of boring, self-serious soundalikes. It is Beck telling us, “I can write fun things, but I have chosen not to.”
 
There is a cheerfulness to the new album in contrast to the pessimism of “Sea Change,” which Beck has called the companion to “Morning Phase.” While it is undeniably pleasant that Beck is optimistic at the ripe age of 43, optimism does not in itself make for good music. Perhaps if he stopped using swooping orchestral pomp for a moment and tried to write something listenable, as he did on his last studio album, “Modern Guilt,” he would meet with more artistic success. He should by now know that pretension does not become middle age any more than shoulder-length thinning blond hair does. Until such time as he has this realization, however, music enthusiasts should stick to buying his older albums.

It’s hard to dislike a book when its prose is vividly illustrative—embellished just enough to color a scene in an imaginative way, yet crisp enough to not get caught up in unnecessary ornamentation. But British author Tessa Hadley’s latest book, “Clever Girl,” proves that beautiful prose itself isn’t enough to elevate a book from good to extraordinary. Author of The New York Times Notable Books “Married Love” and “The London Train,” Tessa Hadley attempts to explore family relationships and class in modern life through the experiences of an Englishwoman named Stella in “Clever Girl.” In 10 separate vignettes, the novel recounts Stella’s life from her childhood to adulthood, starting from the 1960s. The story follows a painfully ordinary life, cluttered with deaths, failed marriages, and rebellious children. Even with its numerous plot-twists and gorgeous prose, “Clever Girl” offers nothing else other than an overwhelming sense of dullness.
 
The book proceeds chronologically, but because of its vignette-based structure, gaps remain in its complicated plot. The first chapter launches into Stella’s childhood, in which she begins to question her father’s supposed death. Stella excels at her private school and is set to go to a university when she meets Valentine. Their passionate teenage romance is short-lived, however, as she is soon abandoned by Val and discovers that she is pregnant. After a stint as a housekeeper and a waitress, she eventually gets pregnant again by a new boyfriend—who is tragically killed before the baby’s birth. Later, the readers find out that she has somehow pursued a university degree and married a businessman, adopting an old friend’s daughter with him—an awful lot happens in this supposedly “ordinary” life.
 
It is easy to relate to Stella at first, as the novel recounts her teenage phase. She narrates in a rebellious but instantly relatable Holden Caulfield-like voice (albeit without the dialect). When she gets into fights with her stepfather, Gerry, one wants to take her side. “I didn’t exactly argue with him. I sometimes said, ‘I didn’t mean to’ in a flippant voice, or denied things it was obvious I had done…All my effort was used to keep my mouth curved upward in a grimacing smile, which I knew was my best weapon because it made Gerry squeeze his fists and raise his voice.” (51)  Similarly, when she falls in love with Val, the reader wants to root for her even when it’s clear that the relationship is bound to fail. The young Stella is full of keen observations and bluntness not yet tamed by age.
 
The tempo of the narration unnecessarily accelerates, however, at the expense of the reader’s connection to Stella. After her unexpected pregnancy and an unplanned gig as a housekeeper, Stella inexplicably moves in with an English teacher. Later, the tragic death of Stella’s lover, Nicky, is sprung on readers without any notice. An event that profoundly alters Stella’s life trajectory is introduced by just a mere chapter break and a fragmented sentence: “And then I was a widow.” (139) Hadley doesn’t even explain to the reader right away how Stella became a widow; rather, she takes a circuitous route, choosing to instead go on a four-page tangent about Stella’s other boyfriend. When the moment of Nicky’s death finally comes, Hadley again truncates this moment with a sentence: “And that was it.” (144) Short sentences can be effective when their length alludes to a greater significance, such as the protagonist’s wish to erase the trauma. But that is not the case in “Clever Girl”—after Nicky’s death, Hadley jumps right into Stella’s life with the same English teacher, once more without any context.
 
Even worse, the unnecessary truncation and fast speed fails to show exactly how Stella grows in the novel. The reader sees change in Stella, but the story behind the change is left out. At first, Stella is shown to be incredibly dependent on Valentine. She alters her appearance to fit his image and follows him even at the expense of forgoing education. However, much later in the novel, at around her second marriage, Stella is shown to be independent when she begins to pursue a graduate education. When exactly did Stella become independent? Was it the teenage pregnancy, her boyfriend’s tragic death, or both? Although readers can assume several possibilities, the book doesn’t explicitly show how or when, losing its narrative line. In addition, Stella seems to be vehemently against the “bourgeois mentality,” or her middle class background, yet she ultimately marries a businessman who supports capitalism. The reader cannot tell if she still disagrees with the laissez-faire approach or has changed her opinion. Instead of illustrating how Stella evolves, Hadley leaves the reader to guess in an unfulfilling manner. 
 
Despite the novel’s shortcomings, Hadley’s prose is delightful to read. Her vivid descriptions keep the book from collapsing entirely. In describing the new place that her family moved to, Hadley writes, “The house was so new it was raw. There were still labels stuck across the glass in the windows, so that it seemed to stare with lifeless eyes at a ruined landscape of red clay.” (42) The illustrative prose sketches the scene in such a realistic manner that it almost masks the dullness of the book. Yet the prose doesn’t entirely salvage the book, as the descriptions are really only decorative—“Clever Girl” fails to be so clever.

“I think I’ll never be close to anyone again.” The words set a tone of grief and heartbreak for Susan Minot’s reading from her latest novel, “Thirty Girls,” at the Harvard Book Store on Feb. 28. As Minot continued reading, their power hung in the air, a reminder of the novel’s turbulent subject matter.
 
Minot drew inspiration for “Thirty Girls,” her first novel in over a decade, from real-life events. While attending a dinner around 16 years ago, Minot met an African woman who described to her how the Lord’s Resistance Army kidnapped 139 girls from a boarding school in northern Uganda. While a nun and teacher from the school were able to save several of the captives, some girls remained with the bandits, including the woman’s daughter. 
 
“The story struck me, so I decided to write about this,” Minot said. Though she, a journalist, rarely covered conflicts in foreign lands, she traveled to Uganda to talk with the affected girls and write a piece about the events. After publishing the article, however, she received no direct response; while she never expected responses for her books, the lack of reaction toward the article made her discontent. “I really did want to communicate something that was going on,” she said.
 
As the years passed, however, Minot was unable to let the story go; when she started her next novel, she decided to recreate the events and their effects. “I couldn’t forget the story about these girls,” she says. “So I thought I would try to write a fictional version of some of the things I had learned there and in a way tell the story more inside what was going on, inside these characters in the situation, instead of outside.”
 
The process of writing “Thirty Girls” was not simple. To convey the narrative accurately, Minot studied accounts from children in similar situations and read psychological explorations of trauma. Her story’s focus also shifted and changed as she wrote. While she initially hoped to explore Uganda’s history, she eventually felt compelled to focus on the characters and their reactions to the events. “I thought it would take three years to write,” Minot said. “It took seven years.”
 
Minot’s finished product interweaves two narratives: that of Esther, a Ugandan girl captured by the Lord’s Resistance Army, and that of Jane, an American journalist hoping to report on the story. Minot initially planned to tell solely Esther’s story, but she added Jane into the narrative after she realized Esther’s events were too brutal when read alone. “There’s only so much you can throw at a reader,” she says. Through the introduction of Jane, Minot was able to add another dimension to the story and contrast the characters to explore both internal and external trauma. “I did want to explore violence, trauma, the fact two people who are existing 10 miles from each other can have different experiences in life,” she said.
 
Though Esther’s experiences are difficult and unusual, portraying a trauma victim was not a huge leap for Minot. “I know what it’s like to be traumatized,” she said. “Everybody does.” Her ability to identify with a different character—to draw connections between two radically different lives—allowed her to weave the two narratives together and create identifiable characters despite the complex subject. “I like to point out the lack of difference rather than the difference,” she said.
 
By focusing on similarities, Minot hoped to close the gap between her readers and her characters. In this objective, she was motivated by her own experience as a reader and her observations about what makes a book powerful. “When I’ve read other books, I’ve been variously moved by them—sometimes…emotionally, sometimes…intellectually,” she says. “I like to read books that make me feel connected to other people. So I think the pleasure that I take in books, I hope to offer any of those things to the reader.”
 
As Minot continued enunciating every word and elucidating every emotion in Esther’s narration, her desire to move her readers through her writing was more than evident. Using outlets of creative expression like writing is an innate response for Minot, and in her eyes, every person. “One is held to make things,” she says. “It seems to me a natural way to respond to the experience of life.” Passing on those different experiences is then all the more crucial. “To convey being alive is an important thing to share with each other,” she said.

“For the first time in my life, every day when I woke up I had clean clothes, and something to eat two, three times a day, as much as I wanted. Once I had that, I realized my revolution was over.” With such subtly captivating lines, Dinaw Mengestu’s “All Our Names” seems in its first few chapters to encapsulate a compellingly human story of war. Mengestu, author of the award-winning novel “The Beautiful Things That Heaven Bears” and 2012 recipient of the MacArthur Foundation genius grant, tells the gripping tale of the would-be liberators of 1970s Kampala, Uganda alongside the stale account of Helen, a social worker who lives in small-town, USA. Told in the alternating first-person chapters of Helen and the enigmatic Isaac, “All Our Names” describes the incompatible stories of Isaac’s struggle in war-torn Uganda and his contrived romance with the apathetic Helen. She and her emotionally stunted commentary on the empathetic Isaac are entirely unnecessary and detract from an ingeniously crafted narrative of compassion and cruelty set during the last gasps of the postcolonial period.
 
Compared to almost every other character within “All Our Names,” Helen, the female protagonist, is flat and unsympathetic. Even her lonely mother, for whom Helen has a nearly maniacal hatred, inspires more sympathy. Abandoned by her father at a young age, Helen, a former high school rebel who sleeps around because she can, is more of a collection of tropes than the 20-something career woman Mengestu intends to create. While Helen makes a tepid journey from a dislike of all things domestic to an affinity for household chores, Isaac, her client and boyfriend, travels a remarkable and bloody path from his family’s home in rural Ethiopia to the quietly racist streets of Helen’s American hometown. The emotional depth and heart-wrenching candor of Isaac’s revolutionary narrative somewhat rescue the novel from the abandoned motifs, heavy-handed symbolism, and general transparency present in Helen’s half of “All Our Names.” In contrast to Helen’s stagnant nine-to-five narrative, Isaac’s story is rich with the promise of opportunity; it begins beside buildings whose vacancy could signal either the “imminent future, or its failure to materialize.” While hanging around the university he wishes he could attend, Isaac meets a young revolutionary whose chilling tale forms the true heart of the novel.  This man, who “smiled and laughed too often for [Isaac] to imagine he could ever hurt someone,” is an enchanting and dynamic character who fits perfectly into Mengestu’s character-driven plot. Unfortunately, it is only when Isaac’s story merges with Helen’s over halfway through novel that the plot can truly take off.
 
Mirroring the incompatibility of Isaac’s and Helen’s stories, “All Our Names” both requires detective work and repeats the most obvious of details. Mengestu’s clean, simple prose encourages a probing reading but becomes tedious when he is not delivering his signature, strikingly universal observations of the human experience. Some lines are so powerful that they resonate long after one puts “All Our Names” down: “The soldiers drank and sang. Nine men had died; it finally felt like a war again.” In other places, “All Our Names” is less profound and even just plain strange—there are moments, for example, when Helen pretends that she is a bird and smells Isaac like a cat. Like Helen, who cannot decide if she is a bird, a cat, or a responsible adult, the novel cannot decide whether it is an interracial romance, an immigrant narrative, or a cautionary tale of human power and cruelty.
 
The tensions between these three categorizations muddle rather than singularize “All Our Names.” While trying to pack so many different ideas into a mere 250 pages, Mengestu seems to have lost sight of where his most powerful concepts lie. “All Our Names” has astounding potential: Isaac and his fellow revolutionaries’ quest for freedom is so accessible and exciting that it is a constant disappointment to return to Helen’s office. The gap in quality between the two narratives becomes especially apparent towards the novel’s end. The emotional bombardment of the ending is doused whenever Helen is mentioned, but thankfully it cannot be entirely diminished and even makes up for the novel’s painfully slow pacing during the first 100 pages. Ultimately, it’s the moving and satisfying conclusion of “All Our Names” alongside Isaac’s engaging narrative that makes the novel worth reading. Isaac, with his 13 family titles, provides most of the names and all of the interest in “All Our Names.”

There are a few things that everyone, regardless of creed, thinks to be evil, and near the top of this short list is PowerPoint. So it is no surprise that, when Lucifer Morningstar—otherwise known as Satan—appears in struggling writer Billy Ridgeway’s living room, the Devil’s proposition is presented in slideshow format. In Jeremy P. Bushnell’s debut novel, “The Weirdness,” not even the Devil is exempt from the trashiness of modern living—and its concomitant humor and angst.
Billy Ridgeway—New Yorker, college dropout, and sandwich-shop employee—has a life that is falling apart. His handful of published short stories have failed to vault him from the obscurity of the sandwich shop’s kitchen, and his art-film director girlfriend, Denver, may have broken up with him; in an all-too-typical twist of modern relationships, he has not heard from her for several days and their status is unclear. As a result, the appearance of the Devil is in some ways a pick-me-up for Billy, although the contents of his PowerPoint presentation are disturbing: a centuries-old warlock in Manhattan, Timothy Ollard, has stolen from Hell a dangerous magical machine that threatens to engulf the universe in fire. The Devil, who would prefer to keep the world around so that there are more souls for him to ensnare, has as a result come to Billy with the seemingly impossible task of capturing the item.
Bushnell’s wildly imaginative plot could have easily come to an ill end in the hands of an author with a heavier touch. Happily, he treats it as a joyful caper rather than an unsuccessful effort at tragicomic meaningfulness. Much of the humor arises from Bushnell’s command of modern trite vocabulary and sloppy grammar and his masterful use of it in dialogue. When asked about his relationship with Denver by his best friend and fellow sandwich-maker, Anil, Billy replies, “It’s just—things with Denver and I are really, uh, challenging right now.” The ridiculousness of these bumbling half-ironic idiolects is brought to the fore by its contrast with Lucifer’s own precocious-child vocabulary and style:  “‘Yeesh,’ Billy says. ‘Don’t be too impressed,’ Lucifer says. ‘The edifice you see is mostly illusory.’ ‘What even…,’ Billy says. ‘What part of the planet is this on?’”
In addition to his effective mimicry of the language of modernity, Bushnell has an acute sense of the chaos and junk that occupy the space and time of every denizen of the 21st century. When Billy wakes to answer his phone, he is undone by his mess. “His limbs jerk uncoordinatedly. He flings an arm onto the bedside table, where it crashes onto the edge of a saucer covered in coins, flipping it into the air. Pennies rain down onto him.... The phone’s not there. It’s on the floor. Each time it rings it scurries further [sic] away from the bed.” His first meeting with Satan is similarly surrounded by mess: “[The Devil] produces a business card, seemingly from nowhere, and places it carefully on the coffee table, among the messy piles of CDs, drug paraphernalia, and magazines.”
More than anything, however, it is Bushnell’s deep awareness of comedic conjunction and sheer quirkiness that gives “The Weirdness” its charm. A prime example is from Billy’s second meeting with the Devil, when they decide to get high together. “‘You want a pull on this?’ [Billy] says, proffering the bowl to Lucifer. ‘Normally I wouldn’t,’ Lucifer says, ‘being here, as I am, on business. But—how did you put it? Why the fuck not? I admire this as a basis for decision-making. You have inspired me to follow your lead.’ ‘Mr. Reasonable,’ Billy says, watching as Lucifer takes his own draw. ‘C’est moi,’ says Lucifer, after a long exhale.’”
One might make the criticism that “The Weirdness” never transcends low burlesque. The themes of eternal punishment, the destruction of the world, and moral agency are not engaged with any seriousness or philosophical sophistication. This, however, is a matter of taste. Bushnell seeks to amuse, not to probe the wounds of human existence, and he does so with great efficacy. There is no point to Satan’s drug use or love of PowerPoint besides humor—and why should there be? There is no reason that humor is not just as worthy an inherent aesthetic end as thematic depth. Life is as funny as it is sad. Literature should be, too.
Ultimately, “The Weirdness” is a novel that succeeds within its parameters, and it succeeds brilliantly. Bushnell has not written a work of great profundity, but he has fulfilled the greatest and perhaps most commonly neglected task of the fiction writer: he has written a work that is immensely entertaining, and more than being merely diverting, is truly funny.

Liam Neeson may be the most convincing sexagenarian action star since Charles Bronson. In “Non-Stop,” he yells, runs, punches, and growls his way through a remarkably charismatic and consistent performance as alcoholic and down-in-the-dumps Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks. What could have been a tour-de-force for Neeson is bogged down, however, by a front-loaded and increasingly derivative script and overwrought direction from Jaume Collet-Serra. After Marks, en route to London on a packed flight, receives a text message that a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes if a large sum of money is not transferred to an offshore account, he uncovers an intricate frame-job that pins him as the terrorist. Initially, Collet-Serra creates a genuinely tense aura of suspicion as passengers begin to turn on Neeson and he becomes desperate. Eventually, however, the plot is reduced to a “Clue”-esque whodunit, complete with an ensemble cast of cardboard passenger stereotypes. While “Non-Stop” is kept partially afloat by Neeson’s powerhouse performance and its initial tension and humanity, it eventually spirals into a cheesy and only mildly satisfying second half.
 
The opening sequence of the film is indicative of its impressive potential. A buzzed Marks lumbers through the airport, the camera alternately tracking him and swooping into first-person. When showing Neeson’s point of view, the field—its edges and movements blurred in a telling representation of drunkenness—darts between sketchy characters to show Neeson’s devotion to keeping his passengers safe. Serra, when he wants to be, is a very effective visual storyteller. The brief glimpses into Neeson’s perspective establish his trustworthiness and make clear that, despite his numerous dependencies, he is exceedingly devoted to what he does. After Marks gets airborne and begins communicating with his tormentor over text, Collet-Serra and the effects team employ another engaging device: the texts, complete with real-time autocorrections, float across the screen. Giving the viewer access to the conversation creates a real-time tension that dramatically boosts the suspense. Other technical factors, including a taut score by John Ottman and exaggerated shaking and rattling to accompany turbulence, help create a stressful mood.
Collet-Serra complements his cinematic flourishes by avoiding the grating humorlessness of “Unknown,” his 2011 collaboration with Neeson, and not taking any of the conventions of the genre too seriously. Where that film was populated by icy, cynical characters, “Non-Stop” has many funny and warm elements. Several gags concern the texts, which have typos and mis-corrections that mimic the real world. Before the rising action gets too overwhelming, many of the passengers on the plane also offer telling societal critiques and quirks; one is paranoid about a Muslim passenger, while another is fixated on the attractive Italian jetsetter couple in front of him. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), who sits next to Neeson’s character on the plane, is clever and kind even in the film’s most intense moments of peril. In addition to offering a number of giggle-worthy quips, her character is by far the most likable in the film and acts as its moral center during Marks’s more erratic moments. Moore avoids her potential for hysterics and delivers a measured performance.
 
The suspense and humor go well with each other until the passengers on the plane turn fully against Marks, who is reported on national news as being responsible for “a hijacking” despite his desperate attempts to prevent the killings. What was during the first half of the movie a deliberate and slow-burning nod to Hitchcock’s brand of coy and fun psychological thriller rapidly becomes a big and tacky “Me vs. Plane” debacle. Most of the issues surround the utter lack of inspiration in the writing of the other passengers. A maudlin subplot about a little girl on the plane reemerges in clichéd attempts at false sweetness. The stereotypical passengers, who suddenly play a far more integral role in the drama, are not at all up to the task. The New York cop, aspiring computer programmer, nerdy teacher, and myriad other potential suspects against Marks are unsympathetic and flimsy. Only Michelle Dockery, of “Downton Abbey” fame, offers some ensemble strength in her role as terrified flight attendant Nancy. By the time the creators of the impossibly intricate hijacking plan are revealed, it’s difficult to care.
 
Even the writing for Neeson, which requires little more than a classic “hard boiled-cop” vibe—he’s magnetic enough to do the rest—becomes overly simplistic and relies on a truly laughable deus ex machina. Although some of the late-game effects—including a riveting emergency landing that rivals that of “Flight” in terms of effects and power—partially redeem the tired script, explosions and bombast can’t shake off poor writing. Neeson certainly doesn’t slow down, but the movie can’t sustain its energy.

To an American viewer, “Stalingrad” is a mediocre Hollywood-style 3D war epic made in Russia. To a Russian filmgoer, though, “Сталинград” is the most technically impressive film made on native soil in a decade-long revival of big Russian movies. It is the highest-grossing Russian film of all time ($67 million gross on a $30 million budget at the time of writing) and the first IMAX 3D Russian film. The production value of “Stalingrad” is as good as anything in the war-film genre that Hollywood majors put out. The most frequently visited parts of the huge bombed-out city on film were a massive constructed set, while the rest of the city was created with very high-quality compositing. Moreover, the flamethrower shots in several of the battle scenes are better than any Hollywood action film set pieces in recent memory. These are all phenomenal achievements for an industry that lacks the established financing structure and centrality of talent that make possible the two superpowers of big-budget production, Los Angeles and Mumbai. The film’s producers actually cobbled together the money to make the film largely from Russian government sources. 
 In The New York Times, Maria Smolnikova, the film’s female lead, said, “In terms of its scope, quality and standards, I think it is of American standards, of the sort few have attempted here, something really venturesome.” The production team has gotten their wish—”Stalingrad” will be distributed widely in the U.S. by Columbia Pictures. It is very exciting that Russia is again turning out big-budget movies that can be evaluated with the same standards as their American counterparts.


 Stalingrad is the story of a small group of Soviet soldiers marooned in an abandoned apartment complex during the the city’s infamous siege. The movie starts and ends very big—opening with huge crowd shots of Soviets crossing the Volga and closing with hundreds of Germans moving into the city—but spends most of its time zoomed into its small cast. Five battle-weary Russian soldiers and one 18-year-old resident of the apartment complex converge “as if by instinct” and take shelter. Each of these people is a well-wrought caricature—there is handsome artilleryman Sergey (Sergey Bondarchuk); a fresh face who is courageous “but not with girls” Nikiforov (Aleksey Barabash); an ex-tenor Krasnov (Oleg Volku); a virtuous middle-aged man Polyakov (Andrey Smolyakov); the hyper-aggressive young Chvanov (Dmitriy Lysenkov); and the 18-year-old Katya (Mariya Smolnikova). Nothing happens in the movie that makes explaining them beyond this worthwhile. They watch each other’s backs, snipe at and perpetrate small attacks against the Germans, look to the sky in despair, and make action movie quips: “In Stalingrad, even broken tanks shoot.” Yes, they do.
 The Germans laying siege on the Russian heroes are Captain Kan (Thomas Kretschmann) and his boss, Khenze (Heiner Lauterbach). Khenze is a Nazi villain in a long tradition—he listens to classical music and eats on a white tablecloth in the morning and orders women and children to be burned alive in the afternoon. There is a history of one-sided depictions of Germans in Russian culture going all the way back to origins of the language—the Russian word for German, “немецкий,” is recognized as innately derogatory, as it comes from the Russian word for “mute.” However, “Stalingrad” does humanize one German: Captain Kan. Kan is shown to be sad he lost his wife at home—he sleeps with a Russian woman named Masha (Yanina Studlina), or as Chvanov calls her, a “kraut-whore.” Regardless, he is portrayed in a much more negative light than the Russians, who have an infinite capacity for brotherhood and sexual restraint.
 Outside of the realm of vicious action sequences, visual effects and the outdoor production design laid out above, Stalingrad is basically an efficiently directed and acted film. Though there is not much offensive in the performances, there is not much memorable either.
 Of course, the movie appeals to Russian nationalism—Russians are deservedly extremely proud of victory at “Stalingrad.” Just this year, the city of Volgograd renamed itself Stalingrad for a day in commemoration of the battle. However, the movie did harp on nationalism—there was a voice-over that used the first-person possessive “our huge country” and more than a few slow-motion scenes in which the men run screaming all “300”-like into combat. Still, for a Russian film, “Stalingrad” shows decent self-discipline on the “Russia is the best, Russia is the most honorable, Russia is the toughest” front.
 The New Yorker critic Pauline Kael described the American flag-thumping Vietnam flick “The Deer Hunter” as having “a romantic adolescent boy’s view of friendship” and “implicit God-and-country, flag-on-the-door political assumptions.” This is about the extent of Stalingrad’s sins in this regard, which, in light of the xenophobia of other Russian hit films released in the last 10 years—the “Брат” (“Brother”) series and “Тара́с Бу́льба” (“Taras Bulba”)—is really not so bad.

“Everything has kind of changed.” So said “Orange Is the New Black” star Laverne Cox about her career after appearing on the hit Netflix series during a visit to Harvard’s Farkas Hall on Feb 24. In an event sponsored by a slew of Harvard’s BGLTQ and arts groups, Cox addressed a diverse audience about her career in television, her advocacy work, and her role as a visible icon in the transgender community. 
It’s hard to separate Cox’s acting career from her race and gender because, according to Cox, “in America, race always plays a role.” For her, the acting work she does is very much tied up in her personal struggles as a transgender woman of color, and when she discusses issues like the rampant poverty in the transgender community or the rates of violence committed against transgendered women especially, it’s easy to understand where her passion and activism come from. Cox explains the expectations she feels by way of citing “Scandal,” saying that “There’s this whole thing about being black in America where you have to be twice as good, and I certainly got the message that you have to be twice as good, and then being trans you have to be four, five times [as good].” Cox is extremely aware of her race and gender and how they impact her ability to get a job due to general misconceptions about what it means to be a black trans woman. 
This was the kind of mentality that Cox brought with her when she joined the cast of Netflix’s “Orange Is the New Black.” Though Cox’s role as transgender inmate Sophia Burset is one of the most visible, positive examples of transgendered representation in television now, Cox is not  new to playing transgendered women on television. Before her role as Burset, Cox made a name for herself as the first trans woman of color on a reality show, appearing on VH1’s “I Want to Work for Diddy” in 2008. She then went on to produce and star in a trans-oriented makeover show, “TRANSform Me,” in 2010. When she heard about the audition for “Orange is the New Black,” Cox was hard at work researching women’s prisons in anticipation for “Free CeCe,” a documentary she is producing about CeCe McDonald, a trans woman who was imprisoned after defending herself in a racially charged assault.
However, Cox does not necessarily present herself as a pioneer of trans representation. “If we look at the reality of it, transgendered women have actually been in mainstream media for the past 60 years. If we look at ‘The Jerry Springer Show,’ or the Maury Povich show, we have had representation, but the question is, ‘What kind of representation?’ and ‘To what end?’” This question of representation is definitely a personal issue for Cox, as her filmography is filled with roles as transexual prostitutes. 
This is why Cox’s role in “Orange is the New Black” is so important. Her visibility has had notable ripple effects in the mainstream and has given Cox a platform from which she has been able to advocate for transgender women to tell their own stories. “What we’re seeing now is trans folks taking more control over how our stories are told and challenging…the ways in which trans stories have been told,” Cox said. Though this kind of pushback has sparked a certain amount of controversy, especially over Katie Couric and Piers Morgan’s recent handling of discussions about transgender issues, Cox has emphasized the need for these discussions. Sometimes, Cox said, people come from a place of ignorance, and sometimes they come from a place of hate.
Near the end of her talk, Cox was asked whether she thought Hollywood would ever be able to cast transgendered actors in non-transgendered roles. She answered that she did. Cox hopes that in the process of continuing her work in Hollywood, she will be able to promote a much larger discussion of gender oppression and how it affects not just trans people, but also cisgender people as well. Cox made a call to action in her talk, saying that while “Orange Is the New Black” has brought a discussion of gender and race and their intersection into people’s homes, it’s also up to viewers of the show to further this discussion and to push back on the norms that have been held for so long.

With squinted eyes braced against the bright Southwestern sun, the landscape blurs past like a gold-hued strip painting by Gerhard Richter. In the middle of the dust and weeds, next to the triple-stranded barbed wire fence that marks the border between the United States and Mexico, David Taylor glimpses what at first appears to be a sleight of hand of the summer heat, a concrete obelisk rising from the ground. Taylor, a photographer-professor from the University of Arizona, has found the inspiration for his next project.
The project, “Working the Line,” records 274 of those obelisks in a photography exhibit at the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies. Taylor’s documentation of these monuments is a contemporary reflection on a survey conducted by the photographer D.R. Payne between 1891 and 1895 under the patronage of the Boundary Commission. In addition to tracing the path of the obelisks, Taylor’s work chronicles the daily events he witnessed along the way, utilizing “the monuments [as] witnesses to the segregation of two political entities that aren’t nearly as monolithic as we like to think.” 
Since the monuments last had their time in the spotlight, much of the physical, political, and social landscape surrounding the border has changed. At a panel before the opening of the exhibit, Taylor pointed out that “there is an awareness that grows, knowing that this is a border that mankind has established for themselves.” The photos in “Working the Line” showcase just that. They are colorful depictions of powerful, contradictory images: first-generation Mexican Americans working as Border Patrol Officers, gun-toting Mexican soldiers amiably giving Taylor directions; air-conditioned immigration offices alongside empty detention centers; and perhaps most movingly, apprehended drug smugglers who were unknowingly used as decoys by their colleagues. Taylor’s photos demand a re-imagining of the international boundary and consideration of the intricacy of the web of human relationships that surrounds it. 
Taylor began his almost three-year-long project in 2007. Over the years since Taylor’s documentation, the United States Border Patrol has doubled in size, and the federal government has constructed over 600 miles of new barrier that is under constant surveillance. Although these measures have allowed Border Patrol to gain control over much of the expanse of the border, people and drugs continue to cross the border, primarily in the most remote, rugged areas of the Southwestern deserts. More than anything, Taylor wants viewers of the exhibition “to contemplate the complexity of the situation.” “Instead of entertaining the idea of getting across the border,” Taylor says, he hopes to force audiences “to look deeper by traveling its length” and to “portray a highly complex, physical, social, and political topography during a period of dramatic change.” 
In Taylor’s pictures, some sections of the border fence seem laughable, as if one could cross them simply by climbing the conveniently placed monument. Other images of the fence are much more imposing, especially those in the newly built areas, which rise like fortress walls from the desert ground. When asked if his book of photographs would serve as a map showing the way for illegal immigrants, Taylor dismissed the possibility. He purported that the passages are already known, before adding, “Where there’s a wall, there’s a way.”

Soothsayers of the digital age have often heralded the coming fall of the live symphony orchestra. Digital formats can do it better, easier, and cheaper, they explain condescendingly before returning to the tired refrain that classical music simply can’t connect to a modern audience. The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra’s March 1 performance in Sanders Theatre elegantly refuted those points, providing a strong reminder of the beauty and timelessness of orchestral music.
 
The concert began with a moving rendition of Richard Strauss’s “Don Juan.” From the ebullience of the opening to the dreamy, sweeping notes of the love theme, the orchestra did a fantastic job conveying the story of Don Juan, a habitual womanizer driven to death by his inability to find a real relationship. The entire piece was emotionally affecting and well-played, but there were a few moments which stood out, including the oboe solo that represents Don Juan’s second love interest. Enticing and wistful, the notes filled Sanders Theatre from top to bottom, yet still felt deeply personal. “Don Juan” was perhaps the most relatable and enjoyable piece of the night; it reached levels of emotional depth that were simply outstanding.
 
Maurice Ravel’s “Rapsodie Espagnole” was next; although well-performed, it lacked the emotional impact of “Don Juan.” The dynamics of the piece were spot-on, allowing the technical subtlety of the music to come through, as well as its excellent percussion rhythms and Spanish influences. Yet, excepting the “Habanera” movement, which stood out for its fluidity and seductiveness, the Ravel piece didn’t hold the same emotional appeal as “Don Juan.” “Rapsodie Espagnole” was a typically challenging choice for the HRO: it’s fairly complex and the themes aren’t always clear, making it less accessible to audiences.
 
After intermission, the HRO performed Beethoven’s Third Symphony, which was clearly meant to be the highlight of the night. The Third is known for its unusual length (about 50 minutes) and emotional variability. To perform it live is a feat of skill and determination, and the orchestra acquitted themselves well throughout. The first movement was engaging from the start, and the second, a funeral march, was hauntingly beautiful. The fourth and final movement crescendoed into an anthemic, powerful statement that resonated both physically and emotionally. Yet despite all that, at times (particularly during the third movement) the symphony felt like a marathon as well as a work of art. The sheer length of the work can be both a boon and a challenge for the orchestra performing it, and losing the main themes within an almost hour-long symphony happens all too easily.
 
While the concert had its lows, the few peccadilloes pointed out here did not truly outweigh the many strengths displayed on stage. The orchestra was technically impeccable throughout the performance (or at least seemed so from a third-row balcony seat), and the music was nothing if not enjoyable. When the last strains of the Third Symphony faded into silence, the orchestra received a standing ovation that extended even into the balcony sections. While this doesn’t do much to enhance the already evident quality of the HRO’s music, it supports the importance of live classical performances.
 
The performance of a well-rehearsed orchestra is not only an auditory pleasure but a visual and emotional one: beyond the individual players and instruments, the orchestra gains a life of its own with the start of the music. The string players—more than 50 of them—were ranged across the stage, yet their bows moved in perfect unison to each swell of the notes. At times, this created the illusion that the orchestra itself was drawing breath. The wonderful physicality of the HRO players, especially the percussion and bass sections, only heightened such an impression.
The understated, unspoken choreography of the orchestra can seem anachronistic in an era of fireworks and backup dancers, but performances like Saturday night’s remind us how crucial live performances are in the appreciation of any genre of music, including classical. Classical music may not be the form of choice today, but we are indebted to musicians like those of the HRO for protecting its legacy.

Pharrell Williams’ “G I R L” is purportedly an “ode to women.” However, the album does very little to distinguish itself from other pop records by male artists or build on the ideas of respecting and appreciating women, a disappointment that is first evident in its diminutive title. But Pharrell does not fail only in his attempt to develop themes about women. “G I R L” also refuses to develop any themes at all, as the essence of the album seems to be a haphazard collection of styles, featured artists, and lyrical content.
With “G I R L,” Pharrell is given a relatively unique opportunity to redefine himself musically. Recently, he has enjoyed a fair amount of publicity, being featured on the extremely popular tracks “Get Lucky” and “Blurred Lines”; however, because neither of these songs emblazoned Pharrell stylistically and because his prominent role in the hip-hop group N.E.R.D. is far from being on the radar of pop culture, Pharrell is virtually free from expectations. Disappointingly, outside of the oft-used, funk-inspired guitar riffs, “G I R L” has only ensured that his signature remains undefined.
One of the greatest detriments to the album is the slew of featured artists, ranging from Daft Punk to Miley Cyrus. Without exception, they dominate the style of their respective songs, at times making it difficult to distinguish who was featuring whom. The track that features Daft Punk, “Gust of Wind,” has enough of their distinctive and heavily produced, robotic vocals to actually be a Daft Punk original; the Miley Cyrus track “Come Get It Bae,” on which “hey”s are yelled ad nauseam, has both Pharrell and Miley singing “You wanna ride it / My motorcycle,” clearly aligning the song with Cyrus’s recent lyrical content.
Similarly, “Know Who You Are” feels very Alicia Keys, and features one of the few moments on the album that addresses its mission. However, although Keys provides uplifting lyrics for “every woman,” this moment is nearly at the end of “G I R L,” and feels like a half-baked attempt to remedy the sometimes sexually aggressive lyrics that are completely inconsistent with Pharrell’s proclaimed goal.
The one collaborator who seemingly has serious potential on “G I R L” is Justin Timberlake. Unfortunately, “Brand New” is one of the least successful tracks. Instrumentally, the song deviate far from expectations, featuring high-energy guitar riffs, light and upbeat percussion, and smoothly delivered, sensual lyrics. As it turns out, however, Pharrell’s often suave voice and Justin Timberlake’s use of nasal tones are unreservedly jarring together. After an onslaught of fascinating mouth sounds (“wuh-kuh-chuh-kuh”), the song proceeds quite standardly for the first few lyrics. Then, the guitar jumps up somewhat clumsily in an awkward interval, and Justin Timberlake’s overbearing vocals hit like a ton—or two—of bricks. Assuming the listener can recover from this, she will discover an ungrounded, uninteresting song that is recklessly chipper.
Pharrell does find some success in his already-released single, “Happy.” Vocally, this is possibly his best performance, and the infectious exhilaration lends the track a unique, cohesive energy not seen on the rest of the album. Though, of course, most rooms do not have roofs, as the song would suggest, the lyrics seem adequate for the extremely lighthearted song, neither detracting nor enhancing.
Another high point is the vibrant and irresistibly danceable opener, “Marilyn Monroe.” Though the lyrics lack consistency when Pharrell sings ineloquent lines like “What can we do? We’re helpless romantics. / We cannot help who we’re attracted to. / So let’s all dance and elevate each other,” these moments are more than made up for by the compelling pre-chorus and chorus, which were reminiscent of the style of Timberlake’s sophomore album, “FutureSex/LoveSounds”—lyrics delivered exclamatorily, no shortness of falsetto, a smart, simple beat, and, of course, the ever-elusive “cool” factor.
Though Pharrell does not exactly dig himself a grave with “G I R L,” he certainly does not set a precedent for future greatness, either. His periodic instances of musical enticement are simply outweighed by general thematic confusion and fundamentally irreconcilable styles throughout the album. At the end of the day, Pharrell’s “ode to women” is more of an ode to mediocrity.

On the second single from his upcoming sophomore album, “Darlings,” Kevin Drew continues to define himself as a competent solo act; echoes of his past musical endeavors as a part of Broken Social Scene remain, but the frontman is clearly focusing on a newer, more polished aesthetic. “Mexican Aftershow Party” is less baroque pop and more synth-driven smoothness. The effect may be less creative than the genre-bending melting pot of Broken Social Scene, but the meticulously constructed ambience of his solo sound no doubt appeals to a broader audience.
 
The suave track evokes a surreal electronic environment; a multitude of repetitive, layered synth tracks echo into oblivion over Drew’s equally repetitive lyrics: “Do you want to go the Mexican aftershow party?....How ‘bout we go to the Mexican aftershow party?” However, despite his strong interest in his gathering of choice, his vocals are sterilized by the unfeeling production. The track’s mixing is too steady and mechanical to truly develop a deeply emotional message; although the sound is precisely orchestrated, it lacks the feeling to support Drew’s cyclic lyrics.
 
Background vocal elements, fuzzy percussion, and heavy synth-horn sounds are just some of the spaceship-turned-nightclub elements that populate the song. It’s certainly a solid solo effort, but after the creativity and passionate musical diversity of Drew’s past, “Mexican Aftershow Party” seems a little too robotic. If this single and its predecessor, “Good Sex”, are any indication, “Darlings” aims to be an album marked by production that is musically precise, but ends up being cold and formulaic.
 
“Darlings” is out on March 18 via Arts & Crafts.

This isn’t the first time two of today’s preeminent guitarists—Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead and Bryce Dessner of The National—have delved into the world of classical music. Greenwood has composed scores for films such as “Norwegian Wood” and “The Master,” while Dessner has collaborated with musicians like Philip Glass and the Kronos Quartet. While not perfect, their upcoming split album—consisting of three orchestral pieces composed by Dessner (“St. Carolyn by the Sea,” “Lachrimae,” and “Raphael”) as well as Greenwood’s “Suite from ‘There Will Be Blood’”—truly highlights the immense possibilities in textures, colors, and emotions that can be achieved when unhindered by the limitations of the rock medium.
 
The concept of incorporating the electric guitar into orchestral music is not unfamiliar; artists such as The Moody Blues and Jon Lord have already attempted the fusion of classical music with rock, with mixed results. What makes Dessner’s compositions unique, however, is his use of the electric guitar to subtly explore sounds that cannot be achieved with any other instrument. While many other musicians have seemingly combined classical music with rock for the sole sake of jumbling the two together, Dessner incorporates the instrument in a much more nuanced manner. In both “St. Carolyn by the Sea” and “Raphael,” the soft-spoken, mellow guitar part blends with the orchestra so naturally that we sometimes forget the electric guitar is an unconventional instrument for an orchestral setting. At the same time, the various textures it creates are distinct and identifiable. The guitars’ chiming harmonics and surreal glissandos in “St. Carolyn by the Sea” are sounds completely unique to the instrument, providing a fresh element to Dessner’s compositions.
 
However, the strongest of Dessner’s pieces, “Lachrimae,” does not make use of the electric guitar. Beginning with the soft, staticky harmonics of the cello section, the piece is soon accompanied in stark contrast to this opening by the hollow and somber-sounding violins. Following this haunting introduction, the strings simulate short, heavy breaths by repeatedly playing swelling, abrupt chords punctuating the drone of the string bass section. The more fast-paced, anxious second half of the piece is precluded by the passing along of an initially quiet, increasingly frantic tremolo between each string section. Only after a period of rapid, intense perpetual motion does the piece finally conclude just as quietly and eerily as it had begun. This piece’s attention to detail and nuance makes it evident that Dessner and conductor André de Ridder make a strong team; while Dessner is the messenger, clearly articulating exactly what he wants in his music, de Ridder is the translator, realizing Dessner’s vision through his precise direction of the Copenhagen Philharmonic.
 
In Dessner’s piece “Raphael,” though, the influence of composers such as Philip Glass and Steve Reich is made almost painfully obvious. Like many minimalist works, Dessner’s compositions primarily rely on the elaboration of recurring ideas throughout the piece. However, its slow, drawn-out pace makes it easy for the listener to get lost or simply uninterested in the music. The development becomes hard to follow at times as well; although Dessner attempts to advance his piece by incorporating extra elements such as violin trills, rhythmic marimba lines, and incessantly rattling percussion, these ultimately distract from rather than contribute to the overall build-up of the piece. Had Dessner paced and developed this piece more gracefully and seamlessly, “Raphael” could have had the potential to be an interesting exploration of a wide variety of textures.
 
Similarly, Greenwood’s “Suite from ‘There Will Be Blood’” clearly illustrates just how amazingly versatile he is as a composer. From the angry, aggressive march of “Future Markets” to the nostalgic, hauntingly beautiful strings in “HW/Hope of New Fields,” Greenwood’s multifaceted piece perfectly encompasses the many aspects of the film within the duration of a 20-minute suite. De Ridder and the Copenhagen Philharmonic’s rendition of this work also adds an extra dimension previously missing from the original soundtrack—the sharp sforzando accents added to each beat of the low string figure in “Future Markets” creates an even more threatening, aggressive sound than the initial rendition of the piece. In “Proven Lands,” de Ridder also slows the tempo to give the percussive pizzicato and col legno of the strings a cooler, more playful feel that is absent from the original recording.
 This album showcases the immense complexity of two musicians not commonly associated with the world of classical music. Both Dessner and Greenwood display a mastery for the orchestral medium, and while Dessner’s compositions are lacking in some aspects, this compilation will certainly be a treat for The National and Radiohead fans interested in observing a different, more contemplative side of these two musicians.

In an interview with Grantland, Real Estate lead singer, songwriter, and frontman Martin Courtney said that he hopes the band’s latest album will possess a great textural quality, enhancing the wafty riffs and pleasantly simple melodies found in abundance on their first two albums. But whereas the band’s first two albums were nostalgic, Courtney believes that “Atlas” strives for a “timeless” feel. Their previous discography paired a simpler sound with unconvincing lyrics that deal with adolescent problems. “Atlas” responds to these criticisms by increasing the band’s musical and lyrical complexity and intrigue.
 
Interestingly, in moving forward, Real Estate has cited influences from the past, particularly from ’70s soft rock. The songs on “Atlas” were also written in the aftermath of the band’s longest stretch on the road following Courtney’s marriage and the release of their second album and Courtney’s marriage. In describing Real Estate’s breezy sound, Courtney says that it “feels comfortable to us."
 
The comfort that the band demonstrates both musically and thematically is surely positive, but this facility also sheds light on the significant weaknesses and limitations of “Atlas.” Choosing not to experiment outside of their chosen style restricts possibilities for transitions in tone and mood that could highlight the brilliance of the sound Real Estate has perfected. There are few bands better at mixing melancholic singing with melodies that teeter on the border between joyfulness and apathy, a delicate balance of conflicting emotions.
 
Real Estate’s signature sound works best when complicated by moments of emotional excess. Unfortunately, though each song on “Atlas” explores elements of numbness and heightened feeling, no one song dives deeply into either extreme, leaving the listener unsatisfied. This may relegate the album to the status of background, work, and mood-setting music for many listeners, which is tolerable but unfortunate.
 
The best sequence of “Atlas” has to be the rewarding and surprising transition from the tragic “Talking Backwards” to the surreal instrumental “April’s Song.” The former is an emotive indie beach tune that contrasts the fastest and most upbeat melody on the album with Courtney’s unchanging melancholic tone. This consistency allows Courtney to enter slightly different atmospheres but always retain his thoughtful, sensitive voice.
 
In “Talking Backwards,” gloom is imposed on cheerfulness lyrically as well when Courtney sings, “And I might as well be talking backwards / Am I making any sense to you? / And the only thing that really matters / Is the one thing I can’t seem to do.” This verse appears three times in the song and should arouse empathy in most listeners, particularly at the song’s end, when Courtney adds, “Make sense of this dream / It’s the one thing I can’t seem to do.”
 
From this downer moment, the album transitions to the “dream” itself, the instrumental “April’s Song” which begins as a sadder epilogue to “Talking Backwards” but transitions into reverie with a bouncy, otherworldly guitar countermelody that serves as a blank canvas to the listener. The listener is then pulled back into the often numb real world by the moan of “it’s so hard to feel” in the next song on the album, “The Bend,” and the dream is over.
 
What is remarkable about this album is its consistency. Each song seems to be necessary for the album as a whole, and each does something slightly different. Real Estate understands that their melodic, soothing riffs are good enough to stand on their own, allowing them to let minutes go by in a song like “Primitive” without the imposition of words. Despite their independence from lyrics, the songs do not lack intrigue and in fact heighten the wondrous sensation of being outdoors, on the road, and in the dream that “Atlas” captures so well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
An op-ed on Wednesday, “When Gay Pride Backfires,” took issue with the existence of separate institutions for people of gender and sexual minorities. In what was undoubtedly a very well-meaning piece, Ian Van Wye claimed that it is self-evident that gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender folk are exactly like straight, cisgender people, and that we should just stop talking about these differences already. In fact, Van Wye feels that “the sexual and gender identities of the people we love are of so little import that we must ultimately discard what strikes me as an outmoded, disjointed way of looking at the world,” though he does think that “we all owe the gay pride movement our thanks for helping to bring our laws into the modern era.”
Unfortunately, he is wrong on both counts.  
Strictly in terms of the law, we have a long way to go. In 29 states, a person may be fired because of their sexual orientation. In 33, the same is true of gender identity. Transgender individuals are often sentenced to prisons that do not match their gender identities. And even though we are apparently approaching “the threshold of marriage equality and full legal rights for gay folks” in his words, even marriage equality is only a reality for less than half of states.
The statistics surrounding the social acceptance of people identifying as LGBTQ are far worse: Of homeless youth, 40 percent are LGBTQ. Nine out of 10 LGBTQ students report facing harassment at school. More than one-third of LGBTQ kids and 41 percent of transgender people have attempted suicide. Transgender people also experience twice the national level of unemployment, with the rate for transgender people of color rising to four times the national average. Transgender people who are unemployed experience four times the average homeless rate, 85 percent more than the average incarceration rate, and more than double the average HIV infection rate.
Last year in Harlem, Islan Nettles, a transgender woman of color, was recognized as transgender by a group of men on the street and subsequently beaten into a coma; she died several days later. This violence had nothing to do with Nettles’s “pride.” She was just walking down the street; it was the perception of her identity and status as an “other” that caused a perfect stranger to murder her. This was not an isolated incident, nor was it a sign of a society that just needs to move on from imaginary prejudices. Tellingly, the one day a year that most of the transgender community comes together is Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day dedicated to those community members who have been killed in the past year, victims of transphobia. The list maintained by the TDoR website cites over 500 victims from 2000 to 2012.
So I must disagree with Van Wye, who makes the mistake of conflating “equality” with marriage equality and media representation. I do not think that the “gay rights” movement has been won or has even come close. I likewise do not think that the Office of BGLTQ Student Life is responsible for all of the problems in the world. The office and other similar resources allow students whose identities are often questioned and rejected by society to feel a sense of belonging.
 
As a straight, white, cisgender man, Van Wye moves through the world in the most privileged of circles, from which it is easy to succumb to the tempting idea that social equality already exists. Each statistic of discrimination, though, has hundreds or thousands of stories behind it, none of which support this unbridled optimism. Even those statistics and stories don’t capture the myriad of microaggressions that can take an equal toll on the life of someone who identifies as a gender or sexual minority.
Even assuming Harvard is the perfect LGBTQ paradise that it probably is not, this campus is not the entire world. Students come to Harvard at various stages of coming out or being out, with different levels of acceptance from their families, having experienced diverse levels of harassment in their hometowns, feeling all sorts of levels of pride in their identities. The resources here on campus aim to help every LGBTQ person who wants it. For some, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life might be redundant, but for others it is all too necessary. In a world where the message to LGBTQ youth is so clearly one of hatred that one-third of them attempt suicide, I hope Van Wye would agree that we should allow queer organizations on campus a little pride.

On March 1, 2014, the Russian parliament approved President Vladimir Putin’s request for military force in Ukraine. Putin justified the need for such intervention by pointing to the “extraordinary situation” in Ukraine and the “danger to the lives of Russian citizens, our compatriots, and the personnel of the military contingent of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” 
But the actual military intervention began days earlier, after a plea from Sergey Aksyonov, the newly appointed Prime Minister of Crimea—voted into power by the quorum-less Crimean parliament at gunpoint. 
Unidentified gunmen, who we now know to be special units of the Russian military, seized governmental buildings in Simferopol, Crimea’s capital. The scenario is sadly familiar to past Russian special operations in Moldova and Georgia aimed at breaking away parts of these post-Soviet countries. 
In his request to the Federation Council, Putin did not identify any actual facts of ethnic tensions in Ukraine that could threaten the lives of Russian citizens in the Crimea, or in Ukraine generally. No acts of ethnic violence occurred that could possibly justify a foreign military intervention. Another popular perception is that Putin invaded Ukraine to protect Russian speakers from violence on the part of the far-right groups, or to ensure their rights for cultural and linguistic self-realization. These justifications are similarly ungrounded.  
Considering the flimsy evidence for events that could reasonably have “provoked” Russian aggression, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine appears groundless and both legally and ethically untenable. Many were disturbed by the attempted repeal of a symbolic law honoring the Russian language by the new Ukrainian parliament, but the untimely move was actually vetoed by Ukraine’s acting President, Oleksandr Turchynov. The Russian language is under no threat in Ukraine. Ukraine remains highly saturated with Russian-language publications and programming on television.  
Instead, as a number of renowned scholars have emphasized, the radicalization of the Ukrainian protest movement occurred in response to violence against peaceful protesters by the government of the former President Viktor Yanukovych.  
Most importantly, both Ukrainian and Russian speakers are citizens of Ukraine. In the past years, and especially during the Euromaidan protest movement of the last three months, Ukrainians of all ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds have demonstrated that Ukraine is united in building a free and open society governed by the values of liberal democracy. To be a Ukrainian today does not mean being a speaker of Ukrainian (in fact, most Ukrainians are bilingual and easily switch between the two languages), or to be of ethnic Ukrainian background. 
Today, the Ukrainian political nation is built around basic human rights and freedoms, governmental accountability, and equal access to the country’s resources for all members of Ukrainian society. In the past months, this has been the core of the protests in their struggle against the political system established by Yanukovych. Evidently, Putin perceives this democratic yearning as a threat to his own power in an increasingly authoritarian Russia. 
But Russian aggression does not just threaten Ukrainian sovereignty—it also deeply threatens the nuclear non-proliferation regime that underpins modern international relations. In 1994, in a decision unprecedented for any existing nuclear-weapon state, Ukraine agreed to abandon its nuclear arsenal, at the time the world’s third largest. In exchange, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Russian Federation promised Ukraine security assurances in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 that specifically promised to refrain from the use of force and to safeguard Ukraine’s borders.
Today, many political analysts miss the point that, if the international community fails to find effective ways to exert pressure on Russia to stop aggression against Ukraine, we could face the dismantling of the global system of security established since the end of the Cold War and the nullification of the greatest achievement of the U.S.-Russia “reset”—the international non-proliferation regime. 
Under what premises can the U.S. or the members of the international community credibly ask Iran, North Korean, India, and Pakistan to scrap or limit their nuclear programs, if the Non-Proliferation Treaty does not guarantee the territorial integrity of the signatory states, which are brazenly violated by another signatory of the treaty? 
Future build-ups of conventional and nuclear arms would await us all, and so would the specter of another global war. In Crimea, more than Ukraine is at stake.

Unbridled evil can be intoxicating—just look at the television shows that captivate us. The unapologetic confessions of Walter White, Don Draper, and Frank Underwood force an addictive complicity that compels us to overlook all manner of sin: deceit, infidelity, murder. The vicarious thrill of simulated evil is disconcertingly enjoyable.
But that’s not a new phenomenon at all. Who can read about Plato’s Ring of Gyges without contemplating it on his finger? Iago’s scheming will always be more captivating than Othello’s rigid righteousness. Give me Madame Defarge over Sydney Carton any day.
We admire villains and anti-heroes because of and not in spite of their evil—a twisted brilliance that we can safely enjoy and admire behind the pages of novels and the screens of televisions.
There’s little secret to the success of House of Cards. Discounting the fact that it’s the remake of a British series of the same name that was itself adapted from a novel by Michael Dobbs, House of Cards casts its aura in the long shadow of Shakespeare.
It’s Kevin Spacey playing a modern Richard III, only with Democrats and Republicans instead of Lancasters and Yorks, with a steelier Lady Macbeth in Claire Underwood and a presidential Othello, no longer the moor of Venice but the unmoored tenant in the White House.
“I have no patience for useless things,” Frank Underwood stoically intones as he euthanizes a dying dog in the opening moment of House of Cards. “Simple plain Clarence, I do love thee so that I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,” Richard likewise plots in his opening scene.
The personification of Washington’s sleazy underbelly, Underwood is captivating precisely because he preys on the deep anxiety and cynicism we have about people in general and politicians in particular. He’s nightmarishly Nixonian, yet somehow worse.
“He’s going to get away with it, isn’t he?” a journalist who knows too much asks his colleague.
“Yes. Yes he is,” she replies. 
Unlike Nixon, Underwood doesn’t get caught. His comeuppance, the inevitable fate of his villainous predecessors Iago, Macbeth, and Edmund, has yet to come.
But we watch (and tacitly applaud) Underwood deceive, manipulate, and kill for a deeper reason too. Just as no one watches Richard III for its depiction of Plantagenet politics, few watch House of Cards for its vampiric rendition of Washington.
Instead, the enduring magnetism of that glorious sun of York, Richard, comes from the beautiful ugliness of his Machiavellian machinations. There are moments of corrupt brilliance that we are unused to being allowed to marvel at—stratagems executed with the elegance of an Euler proof, only directed toward ungodly ends. The allure of Sherlock Holmes’s deductions and Frank Underwood’s seductions is the same rush one gets watching Gary Kasparov dispatch his opponents with incredible insight and unflinching precision.
In pure Richardian fashion, Frank manipulates his opponents into self-destruction in an insatiable rise to the top. Underwood ices his opponents with the same deadly drive as Richard deals out to his brother Clarence and the Princes of the Tower. The intrepid journalist Zoe Barnes fulfills the same temporary usefulness to Underwood as Lady Anne does to Richard.
“Older men hurt you, and then discard you,” Underwood says early on, fully channeling Richard’s gloating over Anne: “I’ll have her; but I will not keep her long.” Indeed, Zoe’s train came soon enough.
With his frequent asides that confess his diabolical intent, Frank is most clearly the son of Richard in both style and substance. But evil men have many parents. Underwood is also an Iago—the impetus for Frank’s vengeance comes from being passed over for secretary of state, just as Cassio’s success was too much for the trusted lieutenant to bear. He’s Macbeth, nakedly ambitious but without a legitimate claim, who abets his deception with the aid of an equally power-hungry spouse. He’s Brutus, repeatedly betraying his loyalties when the moment is ripe. 
There’s also a strong resonance between Underwood and that most complex member of the Shakespearean pantheon of villains: the bastard Edmund in King Lear. Both are misbegotten, with Frank the son of a weak father in a backwater Southern town and Edmund disavowed of his estate by primogeniture.
“As to the legitimate: fine word—legitimate! Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, and my invention thrive, Edmund the base shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper: Now, gods, stand up for the bastard!” Edmund vows in the play’s second scene. It’s the best credo for Underwood for whom legitimacy is a mere afterthought to his indomitable will.
“What you’re asking is just shy of treason?” his protégé Jacqueline Sharp once asks when his web of lies begins to show its elegant threads.
“Just shy, which is politics,” he replies without a second’s hesitation.
And so it goes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: Mar. 04, 2014 at 9:53 p.m.
It has been a year since Harvard administrators disclosed the secret email searches that were carried out in the wake of the Government 1310 cheating scandal. Those searches were the result of poor judgment and vague policies; they violated the few rules that existed, betrayed the community’s trust, and harmed Harvard’s reputation. The scandal, particularly the ill-advised email searches, led to the creation of the Electronic Communications Policy Task Force, chaired by Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89, a former Crimson president. That task force last week released a report  and proposed policy regarding the proper procedure of searching college emails. The Task Force’s charge was to recommend future policies rather than relive past practices, but the context of the search scandal is important in evaluating the Task Force’s work. The proposed policy is more honest, transparent, and accountable than the old system, but the vague standards for searches in misconduct investigations are troubling in light of the administration’s checkered history in that area.
 The proposal goes a long way towards fixing the policy part of the problem. If the policy is adopted, the University will have a single set of rules that apply to all electronic communications rather than a confusing patchwork that varies for students, faculty, and staff. To improve accountability, the Dean of the relevant school or division will have to authorize searches in the case of students or faculty, and detailed records will be kept. The new policy also strongly favors notifying the targets of a search. Perhaps most importantly, there will be an independent oversight committee charged with reviewing searches.
 Even so, the policy is vague. For investigations of misconduct, the policy would require that searches only be conducted when the investigations “advance a legitimate institutional purpose.” While past searches of electronic communications have been very rare, the proposal leaves open the possibility that any investigation with any bearing on electronic communications could result in a search. The person authorizing the search is supposed to “weigh not only the stated reasons for access but also the possible effect of access on University values such as academic freedom and internal trust and confidence.” The proposed policy is clearer and more accountable than the former system, but it still requires that students, faculty, and staff trust that administrators who authorize searches have good judgment, sincere intentions, and the best interests of Harvard as a whole in mind. 
The vague language points to the central trade-off of the electronic communications policy. If the policy were a prescriptive blueprint for when searches are permissible, it would leave out unusual or complicated cases. That sort of policy would be useless at precisely the time when a policy is most needed. The policy clearly needs to be flexible. The vague standard of a “legitimate institutional purpose,” however, is too broad. The policy should make clear, for example, that email searches are not warranted in most cases. The limited records of past searches suggest that they have only been conducted in extraordinary circumstances, but the proposed policy opens the door for searches in a much wider array of cases, depending on which purposes are “legitimate.” There are dangers in being too prescriptive, but the experiences of the past year weigh heavily in favor of restricting searches. The policy should require that searches in misconduct cases be limited to the target of the investigation and should only be conducted in the most serious cases.
The report and proposed policy are thoughtful, well-reasoned, and sorely needed. The main challenge is to find the appropriate balance between flexibility and protection for students, faculty, and staff. The Task Force has done extraordinary work in the face of a complicated problem, and the public comment period offers an opportunity for everyone in the Harvard community to weigh in on where that balance falls. The email search revelations of a year ago may seem like the distant past, but electronic communications policy matters just as much today as it did a year ago.
This editorial has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Mar. 04, 2014
An earlier version of this article mistakenly claimed that Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron was in the Class of 1986.  In fact, he was in the Class of 1989.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Happiness Project, a Harvard wellness group, has partnered with student organizations at MIT, Wellesley, Yale, and the University of California, Los Angeles, to expand the student health initiative The Happiness Challenge to the four college campuses this spring.
 
The annual Happiness Challenge, which lasts eight weeks, aims to boost student happiness by issuing weekly tasks related to healthy habits. Participants can win prizes for successful completion of each task.
 
Cindy W. Shih '15, an inactive Crimson news editor and co-chair of the Happiness Project, said that student organizers at the four schools will alter the standard Challenge framework to suit the needs of their respective campuses.
“We wanted to have that personal community feel,” she said. “By asking these clubs to work with us, they get to make it their own and personalize it.”
According to Shih, changes might include different schedules, prizes, and campus events held in conjunction with the Challenge at each school. 
Despite these individual changes, Sheena Nie, an MIT sophomore and organizer of the MIT Happiness Challenge, said that close collaboration between participating schools has helped foster the success of the Project on the MIT campus so far. 
“From an organizational perspective, I get a lot out of working with the schools—we share resources, feedback,” she said.
According to Nie and Shih, organizers are even planning a joint study break for both Harvard and MIT participants later this semester.
Nie added that she doubted that the MIT effort would have been able to manage the large number of students that it has attracted during its first year without guidance and help from other schools.
Over 1200 students are currently signed up for the MIT Happiness Challenge, the largest number of participants at any of the universities.
Nie also said she thinks participants are, in part, reaping benefits from the Challenge because it has brought student organizations from multiple campuses together to tackle student stress.
“Collaborating across the schools teaches students that it’s not just an issue at MIT—it’s across all the American universities,” she said. “From the participants’ perspective, they see that it’s a huge issue that other students at other schools are organizing around.” 
Shih noted that the challenge is likely to expand to more campuses soon. Several colleges have already reached out to her to express a desire to bring the challenge to their schools since the challenge started two weeks ago at Harvard, Yale, and MIT.
“Being able to extend…to other places is a good thing for any organization,” said Maria T. Lai '17, a participant in the Happiness Project at Harvard. “The more people they can reach, the better. If you can help students in other schools, that’s good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
From early morning duties to late night shifts, staff at Harvard maintain the dining halls, provide custodial services, and work to keep the campus secure. While many of these workers are directly employed by the University, thousands of them are actually employed by independent companies, which work on contract for Harvard. 
On paper, the same rules apply to both contracted workers and University employees, but some contracted workers—who may even work side by side with Harvard employees—say that they face unequal working conditions.
One of Harvard’s most recognizable contractors is Securitas Security Services USA, Inc., a company that provides security guards across campus. Others include Unicco, which provides custodial workers, and Sodexo, which offers catering services. Because of their contracted status, workers at these companies often straddle the line between being members of the Harvard staff and being outsiders.
One Securitas officer, when asked whether she felt as if she were treated differently than a direct Harvard employee, simply responded, “Yes.” She spoke on the condition of anonymity due to concerns about angering her supervisors.
Eight other contracted workers declined to comment for this story, many saying that they were prohibited from speaking with reporters.
Still, union leaders and workers who did grant interviews say that despite comparable compensation between contract workers and Harvard employees, contracted workers often do not receive the same non-wage benefits as full employees. Furthermore, confusion regarding the supervision of contracted workers and contracting companies’ incentives to maintain positive relations with Harvard can allegedly lead to unexpected worker transfers, shift changes, and what some call a problematic grievance process.
 
EQUALITY ON PAPER
 
Under current University policy, contracted workers are entitled to the same wages as Harvard employees in similar positions, but some say that the problem of equalizing non-wage benefits and treatment, such as membership to certain discount programs, remains.
When the Securitas contract was renegotiated for an additional three years in 2012 after a prolonged discussion about benefits, Securitas workers and their union, SEIU Local 615, argued that they deserved the same compensation—through benefits as well as wages—as direct Harvard employees. This dispute came ten years after Harvard instituted the Wage Benefit and Parity Policy, which was intended to solve the problem of wage discrepancies, according to Tania deLuzuriaga, a senior Harvard communications officer, in mid-December.
The WBPP “seeks to ensure that contracted custodial, retail dining and security service workers at Harvard receive total compensation comparable to that offered to corresponding University employees,” deLuzuriaga wrote in an earlier email in November.
But some union leaders and workers say that the policy’s scope is limited, leaving room for a disparity in how unions are able to address workers’ complaints.
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, said in November that the WBPP clarified and equalized certain explicit articles of the contract—articles that generate grievances that the union is already able to resolve quickly. But, Langley said, complaints that the union receives mostly pertain to a category known as “management rights,” which includes transfers, shift switches, and other complaints not explicitly addressed in the workers’ contract or in the WBPP.
 
TRANSFER TROUBLES
 
The ambiguity of “management rights” allows for a variety of gaps between Harvard employees and contracted workers in labor relations and treatment, such as worker transfers and shift assignments, which contracted employees do not have the infrastructure to protest against, Langley said. These “management rights” allow supervisors to make workplace decisions at their own discretion, according to union officials Langley and Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, which represents more than 4,000 Harvard employees.
While it is possible for employees in all sectors at Harvard to be transferred, Langley said that when contracted workers are transferred, employers do not need to state a reason, and employees cannot appeal most transfers.
Two contracted workers both said that they had been transferred by Securitas management during their time at Harvard. Both Securitas officers added that they know many colleagues who have suffered from what they call punitive transfers, although almost a dozen workers approached declined to comment on personal experiences.
Aryt Alasti, a Securitas worker, also said that he and many of his colleagues have allegedly experienced what he called a “non-disciplinary transfer” to another facility. According to Alasti, if an in-house worker was transferred without reason, there are many stages of appeal they could go through. For contracted workers, however, Alasti said “there is no recourse.”
“The management has the right to transfer people for operational necessity,” Langley said. “[But] sometimes employers transfer people as punishment.... It might be a more isolated location. It might be night shift versus day shift.”
The anonymous Securitas officer referenced earlier described a personal incidence of unfair targeting when she began working at Harvard.
“[The newly hired security manager] went out of his way to try to catch me using a cell phone or not doing my job or whatever reason they have to get rid of you, move you,” she said in a November interview. Furthermore, she alleged that the conflict continued when her manager received a complaint from a Harvard affiliate whose identification she had checked.
She said that she was transferred that night to a different and “less desirable” location on Harvard’s campus.
 
‘NO RECOURSE’
 
The complaint of the anonymous Securitas worker, Langley said, is not unusual, but because those complaints are not related to a worker’s employment contract, there is often little that the worker and the union can do in response.
Instead, for all employees, officially filed grievances must relate to a violation of certain articles of their employment contract, such as stipulations related to vacation, medical insurance, or wages, not management rights, which concern the employer’s actions outside of the contract.
Langley said that most officially filed grievances are resolved quickly because they relate to explicit portions of the contract.
For other complaints, he said that SEIU Local 615 does its best to petition Securitas management about worker issues, whether or not they are labeled as official grievances. With transfers that the union suspects are punitive, Langley said that the union requires a letter from Securitas stating why the contracted employee was moved or, if applicable, a statement from an involved Harvard affiliate. Both Langley and Jaeger said that if they discover a trend of transferring employees of the same gender or race, they can bring that information to Harvard and start an investigation.
Since these complaints are not officially filed, the union does not track their exact frequency, according to Langley. However, Langley said that the number of official grievances is far fewer than the number of total complaints. At a point in mid-November, Langley said that SEIU Local 615 was addressing twelve ongoing grievances and many more complaints.
Alasti said that he has heard stories of contract workers being passed up for positions which they were qualified for in terms of capability and experience—a case in which an in-house employee would have grounds to appeal.
“But due to a whim,” he said, “which is all you can call it, with the facility manager involved, they were denied that position.”
Alasti said that he and his colleagues would not be able to file an official grievance with Securitas, but could only file an informal complaint to the company which he described as a less effective option. Of the process for contract workers, Alasti said, “that’s the end of it.”
Moreover, Alasti said that employees often feel that the risks of voicing their concerns may outweigh the benefits.
 
“It's not worthwhile for our people to be making targets of themselves,” he said.
 
When contract workers have conflicts of personality with their Harvard supervisors, the management of companies like Securitas are more likely to transfer the employee without pressing for further information from the supervisor. According to union leaders, this is a result of their desire to maintain a positive working relationship with their client, Harvard. This dynamic does not exist for direct employees of Harvard, resulting in a less complicated employee-supervisor relationship.
When contacted about appeals and complaints processes, the Harvard Human Resources Department referred requests for comment to Harvard Public Affairs and Communications. DeLuzuriaga released a statement emphasizing that negotiations are handled by the direct employer, not Harvard, writing in January that “the vast majority of contract employees are represented by collective bargaining units, who negotiate contracts covering the terms and conditions of employment with their employer, not Harvard.“
Thomas R. Fagan, Vice President of Human Resources and Administration at the Securitas Northeast office, declined to comment for this story, saying that he could not discuss “client-specific matters.”
Economics professor Richard B. Freeman, who is also the faculty co-director of the Labor and Worklife Program at the Law School, said in December that workers’ difficulty in airing complaints with Harvard is indicative of the University shifting responsibility to its contractors, even though contracted employees work on campus and are sometimes overseen by Harvard’s management.
“Basically, Harvard doesn’t want to talk to anybody about anything…. They’ll say, ‘this is not our business, these are not our employees,’” he said.
 
‘EVERYBODY PASSES THE BUCK’
 
Contracted workers also find themselves excluded from many non-monetary benefits, such as access to Harvard facilities and discounts on travel costs, that University employees receive due to their affiliation with an institution with wide-reaching resources.
For example, Harvard’s CommuterChoice program aims to publicize “commuting information and planning services” for employees on their way to and from Harvard campuses by offering transit passes and up to 50 percent discounts on MBTA travel fares. Harvard affiliates are offered several discounts in Boston and Cambridge, but most, including the Hubway and Zipcar discounts, require a Harvard email address to register online.
 
According to Colin B. Durrant, a spokesperson from Harvard’s Office of Sustainability, individuals without Harvard email addresses can work with the Office of Sustainability to register for these programs, but they still must be “benefits-eligible faculty and staff paid directly by Harvard University.”
Alasti wrote in an email in December that outsourced workers do not have access to “a variety of housing, travel, [and] counseling” benefits.
“We don’t have access to libraries or gymnasiums, can’t purchase parking permits,” he wrote. “For us security guards, we’re officially not permitted to be in even the publically accessible Harvard buildings unless we are on duty or have ‘official business’ there.”
 
Freeman said that the discrepancy is made even more salient by the fact that “Harvard treats its workers well…. Of course there will be disputes, but workers are proud to work for Harvard.”
Yet when it comes to contracted workers, “Harvard washes its hands of any responsibility,” Freeman said, “everybody passes the buck.”

Samuel G. Greenberg ’14 and Sarah A. Rosenkrantz ’14, co-directors of the the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter’s Youth Initiative, appealed to the Harvard community Monday night for support in their campaign to open a youth homeless shelter in Harvard Square within the year.
Calling their campaign “1000 Nights,” Greenberg and Rosenkrantz told a crowd gathered at a fundraising and outreach event in the Fong Auditorium that they hope to raise enough money for 1000 nights worth of housing, food, and case management services for the new shelter.
Targeted to open in Feb. 2015, the youth shelter would share its space with Youth on Fire, a Cambridge-based non-profit that provides daytime drop-in services—ranging from hot meals to peer counseling—to youth ages 24 and under.
Ayala Livny, program manager of Youth of Fire, spoke to the need for linking Youth on Fire’s daytime services with an overnight shelter.
“Sometimes it feels like what we’re doing is a band-aid,” Livny said of Youth on Fire. “We provide some really important support and services, but when we close at 6, our members have to walk back out in the cold.”
Livny also said that a loss of funding for Youth on Fire adds urgency to the partnership. She explained that the program is slated to downsize in April of this year, cutting drop-in services and relocating from their location near the Law School to Central Square.
“We’re losing our home and getting an office,” Livny said. If the group the were to join the proposed shelter, it would be able to resume providing its current services at Harvard by next February, when supporters hope to open the new shelter.
The event, which lasted an hour and a half, featured homeless youth who spoke about the need for a safe place to sleep for people their age. The danger of victimization, the speakers said, extended beyond the streets.
“Going to an adult shelter, you can get robbed, you can get raped,” said Max Brandeis, 23.
Brandeis was one of the Youth on Fire members featured in the documentary “No Place Like Home,” which was shown at the event. In the documentary, she said that homeless youth sometimes seek out arrest in order to get “three hots and a cot.”
At the end of the evening, HSHS Youth Shelter volunteers invited the audience to donate money to the ‘1000 Nights’ Campaign or to appeal to the Massachusetts state legislature for added funding for youth homelessness services.
“We do have a pretty impressive ability as a student body to do things tangibly and to do things intangibly,” Greenberg said. “Tangibly, that’s donating a little bit of money, a lot of time.... Intangibly, that’s just saying that we care.”
HSHS has already raised $60,000, which it will put toward supporting the new shelter. Organizers said that they estimate a new shelter would cost roughly $70,000 a year to operate based on the current cost of running the current shelter.
In the coming months, the youth shelter organizers said they will finalize a location for the shelter and work with youth to develop policies for the shelter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Posing as statues and braving chilly winds, students stood on crates around the Yard Tuesday afternoon with signs around their necks exhibiting facts and questions about gender at Harvard. The one-hour display was part of the Radcliffe Statues Project, an event organized by the Harvard College Women’s Center to begin dialogue about gender inclusive spaces on campus.
 
The Radcliffe Statues Project is part of Women’s Week 2014, a series of events from March 2 to March 8 to celebrate and promote discussion on women and gender at Harvard. This year’s theme is “Women at Work.”
 
“A big part of [the Radcliffe Statues Project] is that it’s fun. It’s playful,” Bex H. Kwan ’14, an intern at the HCWC and an event organizer, said in reference to the project. Kwan called the event an “artist intervention,” and explained it was conceived partially to defy the perception that any discussion on women’s rights and gender inclusivity had to be angry.
 
“This is something that we all live,” Kwan said.
True to this message, project volunteers displayed facts about the history of gender at Harvard connected to the campus buildings in front of which they stood. The two students posing in front of Annenberg Dining Hall wore signs that said: “There are over 50 busts and statues in Annenberg. Not a single one is of a woman,” and “There are many distinguished female graduates of Harvard-Radcliffe. Why do you think they are less recognized?”
Students posed in front of seven locations around the Yard—Annenberg Dining Hall, the Science Center, Canady B Entryway, Lamont Library, Sever Hall, University Hall, and Mass Hall.
 
Students passing by the “statues” were encouraged to take photos with them and post them onto the HCWC’s Facebook page to be entered into a prize raffle. Mariah T. Browne ’15, a volunteer stationed at the Science Center Plaza, explained that the social media campaign was meant to spread awareness of the installation and the issues it raised beyond those who were able to see the statues in person.
 
According to Kwan, the project was an attempt to reach members of Harvard’s community that would not necessarily attend traditional events like panels and discussions, since it was highly visual both on campus and on the web.
 
“No matter how great a Women’s Week event is, as lots of people organizing events at Harvard know, attention is always limited,” said Kwan, adding that organizers wanted to “break the mold” and avoid “preaching to the choir.”

Harvard students know that their school is off the Red Line.
But most do not know that Harvard has its own Red Line—the Ultimate Frisbee team on campus.
Last week junior Jeremy Nixon, a 6’ 2” cutter on Red Line, was recruited to play for the Boston Whitecaps, a Major League Ultimate team that won the national championship in 2013.
Nixon, who has only been playing Ultimate since his freshman fall, still has his senior year at Harvard to play for the Red Line, but can also compete in Whitecaps games.
“Obviously it feels great to be sought out by an organization that is extremely good and has some of the best players in the world on the team,” Nixon said. “Making this team really feels like being approved by the rest of the high level Ultimate community.”
Nixon credits much of his progress on the field to previous football and track experience he had in high school. Transitioning to Ultimate after being a state level hurdler and wide receiver allowed Nixon to focus on fundamentals such as throwing in order to become an elite Ultimate player.
“I have an athletic background that has helped me to play Ultimate at a high level,” Nixon said. “I really needed that background so I could focus on learning things like spacing on the field and tactical awareness of other players.”
The Whitecaps, after going 10-0 last season and bringing a championship back to Boston, will start their season on April 12 and play 10 games, with the season ending in June.
According to the Whitecaps website, Nixon is “A tall and fast cutter who uses his positioning and athleticism to challenge both the man he’s guarding and the player with the disc, the Whitecaps will use Nixon to shut down opposing cutters.”
The transition from the collegiate to professional level of competition will be a new experience for Nixon, but it is something that he is willing to take on as a welcome challenge.
“The speed of the game is pretty different,” Nixon said. “Every player is going to be playing at a faster speed than I’m used to. I will have to play with a mindset that everything is more intense.”
Although adjusting to the speed of the game and his new teammates will take time, Nixon is eager to be pushed to excel in a new Ultimate community. While Nixon still has a season and a half left at Harvard to play for the Red Line, he will now compete and help bring back victories for two Boston

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite not arriving in Cambridge as one of the top high school recruits in the country, men’s swimming and diving co-captain Chris Satterthwaite showed this weekend why he is now considered one of the best swimmers in the conference.
Satterthwaite led the team throughout the Ivy League Championship at Blodgett Pool this past weekend, putting up big points and record times to lead the Crimson to its first Ivy League title in six seasons.  This year’s crown marks Harvard’s 23rd Ancient Eight championship overall.
“The Ivy League Championship is something that we had set as a team goal for the past four years,” Satterthwaite said. “We knew it was going to be a tough fight, and we just had to stay mentally strong for all three days. This is something we definitely appreciate.  We put a lot of work in, and we’re glad it finally paid off."
The work that Satterthwaite has put in over his four years at Harvard was evident time and time again this weekend, as he helped the Crimson fight off solid competition from its Princeton rivals.  The Tigers had won the Ancient Eight title every year from 2009 to 2013.
Satterthwaite and the Harvard squad didn’t waste any time setting the tone.  The meet’s opening event was a 200 freestyle relay in which a Satterthwaite anchored foursome outswam its opponents by more than a second. The team broke its own school record and put up 64 points in the process.
Satterthwaite made his presence felt in individual events as well, as he came through with first-place finishes in both the 200 and 100 freestyle events and earned a third-place finish in the 50 free.
“There aren’t a lot of people that can [do that],” Harvard coach Kevin Tyrrell said. “Chris can score lots of points in lots of different events. Those freestyle races are huge for us, because they not only score lots of points individually, but they give us the opportunity to put Chris as our top swimmer on numerous relays."
In addition to the 200 free relay, Satterthwaite swam in the 400 medley relay, the 800 free relay, and the 400 free relay. The Crimson picked up first-place finishes in all four of those events.The 400 free relay, which was the last event of the championship, showcased Satterthwaite’s ability.
Going into that race, Harvard was already in position to win the meet, which allowed the Crimson swimmers to open up and go for broke.
“We had a big enough lead going into that event…so I didn’t have to tell them to go really slow in their starts and be worried about disqualifying the relay,” Tyrrell said.
The event was also a fitting way for Satterthwaite to cap off his final Ivy League Championship.
“The 400 free relay is probably my favorite event, just because we’ve had the same three guys on that relay since freshman year,” Satterthwaite said.  “Four years ago when I was a freshman, the meet was at Harvard as well, so it was kind of surreal to be almost in the exact same scenario, except this time we were winning the meet. There was a lot going through my mind on that final leg, but ultimately I was just trying to get to the wall."
As it happened, he got to the wall in record time. His anchor leg capped off a 2:53.64 run to shatter a 34-year-old Blodgett pool record and seal the win for Harvard. The team’s time, however, was more than a full second slower than its meet-record mark set last year at Brown.
Satterthwaite’s presence was a key factor in the Crimson’s eventual 82-point victory, but the senior attributed the credit for the triumph to his teammates.
“I could list off our entire roster for notable performances,” he said.
During his time in the Harvard program, Satterthwaite has developed as not only a solid relay anchor, but also as a solid anchor and role model for his teammates.
“Chris is an…example of what we try to do with the program,” Tyrrell said.  “His work ethic is tremendous, and his attitude is infectious within the group.  He has a very positive attitude, and that rubs off on other people, so as he’s getting better, he really pushes other people to get better at the same time.”
The senior cited team camaraderie as instrumental in his journey from lightly regarded high school swimmer to Ivy League champion.
“The team has been an incredibly close family for the past four years,” Satterthwaite said. “It’s been an environment that’s been very conducive to success and improving.”
While Satterthwaite’s Crimson career winds to a close, his talent, work ethic, and leadership have allowed him to leave his mark on the Harvard swimming program.
“He’s dedicated to the sport,” Tyrrell said. “Chris is going to be a huge loss for us next year.”

Welcome to “Listen Up,” Flyby’s bi-weekly advice column written by two uniquely unqualified, naive, decidedly uninteresting sophomores from the back table in Adams Dining Hall. We’ve been flooded by submissions since we re-launched this column. Over the course of nine days, we’ve received more than 30 submissions (thanks, Mom!) The number of Harvard students that do not seem to know how to submit advice questions has also been somewhat disconcerting. “Steven’s scout op nerf,” is not a valid question, nor is a 424-word letter asking Dev for a casual meet-up (his answer is still yes.) 
We rounded up some actual questions and provided thoughtful answers below. Prepare to be inspired.
(Also don’t forget to submit your questions here to be included in the next installment of Listen Up! Come on, we know you have problems. Here’s your chance to whine.)
Note: These are all actual questions we have received through our submission form. Yes, people actually wrote them. We were surprised too. If you submitted a question and do not see a response below, have no fear, we will do our best to address your concerns about spaghetti with self-awareness, your crush on Steven S. Lee*, and your flirting problems with Brazilian girls as soon as we can (again, people actually wrote questions on those topics.)
*Steven would love to get coffee with whomever submitted that question. HMU, please.
Dev, will you bear my offspring?
Something about the science is still out on male birthing. In other words, no. (Unless Tom Brady submitted this question, in which case, yes, our bond will make science work.)
How do I ask out the cute kid from section having barely ever spoken to him since the beginning of the year?
This is exactly the type of question we expect to see in this column. After all, a previously conducted survey shows that five out of the five students who read this column do so primarily for advice about their love lives (and yes, there are more than five people who read it.)
Your situation is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because, hey you’re in a class with your crush! Think about it, one March 11th night as you and your crush rely on each other to stay awake studying for that midterm in the most romantic of study locations (the Larsen Room in Lamont, duh), the sparks will fly and you’ll be thanking us all the way to your honeymoon. A curse because, no one ends up liking anyone in section. Either you participate too much and look like a know-it-all or you participate too little and look like a dunce.
So what should you do? Here’s our step-by-step guide to getting a 10 out of 10 for your graded assignment and for your love life.
Never actively participate in class, but always make it a point to chime in positively after your love interest has voice his or her opinion on the topic. A common opening phrase to use is “going off of what [insert name of ‘kid’] said…” But feel free to experiment with other transition phrases like “Kid brings up a really good point…” and “What my soon-to-be lover said is the right way to think about this emerging debate among scholars…”
Can’t muster the courage to regurgitate something that was just said by the previous speaker? Have no fear. Throwing a casual wink in the direction of your crush every time they participate is a surefire way to get attention. When the TF hands back assignments, grab your crush’s hand as they reach for their paper with a little ‘oops, excuse me.’ If you’re feeling adventurous, ‘accidentally’ grab your crush’s graded assignment as you rush out the door. Email them later about the ‘mixup’: “Hey, I accidentally took your assignment instead of mine. Meet me at Crema at 6 to exchange? And if 6 doesn’t work for you, how about 11 in my bedroom :)?”
Why is a convergent sequence also bounded?
The proof is trivial and is left to the reader as an exercise.
P.S. Maybe you would know the answer is you studied more math instead of spending your time on Flyby’s submission form. (On second thought, please read more Flyby and keep submitting questions. As unhelpful as we are, we are surely more helpful than real analysis. Also, Flyby is great. Check out this oldie but goodie.)
Guys, who had a more significant influence on country music, Me or Willie Nelson?
Willie Nelson. He has won 11 Grammy Awards and 9 Country Music Awards. He’s been inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the National Agricultural Hall of Fame. So unless Carrie Underwood reads Flyby, we’re going to stick with Willie Nelson.
Who do you think you are and what did you do with those Winthrop seniors I knew and loved?
So there's thing called graduating that seniors do. It doesn't mean they don't love you, they just don’t love you enough to stay or keep seeing you or keep talking to you. And although the M&M and wine markets of Cambridge have surely suffered immensely with the departure of Julia L. Ryan and Sara L. A. Erwin, it’s nothing compared to our loss. But we push on. Just like Alfred the butler tells Batman, “endure.” And endure we have. As far as we can tell, Sara is eloping with some guy named Jordan, and Julia is learning how to sail on the Atlantic. But judging by the contents of several of this week’s submissions, they both have plenty of time to submit questions to Listen Up, so they seem to be somewhat preserving their sanity.
And who are we? We’re just a couple of sophomores trying to fill the shoes of two angsty seniors. We’ll get there someday.
Are you Dev Patel like the actor?? I didn’t know you went to Harvard! I’d love to meet up for coffee or something so let me know :)
Believe it or not, it was not too long ago that a senior in Adams dining hall considered taking a photo with me due to my celebrity status. So I guess the answer is yes. (Just don’t tell Frieda.)
I’m a senior girl. Is it acceptable to hook up with sophomore guys, or is that straight cougar status?
As students at this esteemed institution, it is of utmost importance that we consult the existing literature on an issue before we seek to add to the growing body of knowledge. (Attention person who asked the question about the section crush: that sentence is a good example of what to say during section if you want to be hated by your crush in section).
Listen Up! has been consistent on this issue: no walks of shame from the Yard.
The most important piece of academic work in the last decade, How I Met Your Mother, establishes a clear mathematical formula for determining what a societally accepted age difference would be for hook-ups: Your hook-up’s age should be no less than your age, divided by 2, plus 7. [For readers out there who took Anthropology 1010 to fulfill their EMR requirement, that ends up being 17.5 years (which we will round up to 18 years for legal purposes) if you’re currently a 21-year-old senior and 18 years if you’re a 22-year-old senior.]
So senior girl, you seem to be in the clear. Most sophomores are older than 18.
In all honesty though, you should be able to hook-up with any person that you want that goes to this school without fear of being called a ‘cougar.’* Just make sure that it’s consensual and that you yourself are okay with the age difference.
*Unless you’re a forty-year-old woman taking CS50 through the Extension school on the prowl for a Harvard College sophomore. Then you’re definitely a cougar. No question.
Steven, what exactly is the status of your relationship with Dev A. Patel?
According to Steven: Acquaintances.According to Dev: Lovers.According to the general public: Best friends.So you take your pick.
I have a slightly bigger frame, sometimes my friends refer to me as solid, sturdy, and “rock-like.” I feel like I need to go on a diet, what should I do?
First, get better friends. Steven and I are pretty lonely most of the time, we’re available as replacements.
Second, rocks are great. That one is definitely a compliment. Without them we wouldn’t have Quincy or Mather (okay, so maybe not a very compelling argument). But rocks gave us Stonehenge. And Stonehenge gave us this ridiculously good Ylvis song. Also, Pop Rocks. And the Thing in the Fantastic Four is clearly the second best of the Four (Jessica Alba takes first, but she’s an actual superhero in real life so that isn’t even fair).
Third, and most importantly, staying healthy is most important. As regular gym patrons ourselves (we won’t define “regular”), we advocate for healthy and hearty meals and regular exercise. Worst case, you can just walk to Mather a few times to reconnect with your fellow rocks, that’s quite a workout in itself.
Hi Dev and Steven, I just found out that one of my blockmates is transferring houses for next year. It’s a huge relief—I didn’t want to live with him—but what am I supposed to do until then? Any advice is appreciated!
It’s a tricky situation that you’re in. On one hand, you want to celebrate as much as possible that the weakest link in your blocking group has just left. On the other hand if your blockmate suspects that you’re happy about the situation he may give your bed the Yale-laundry-machine treatment as the final act in his or her reign of terror.
One thing to remember is that your blockmate can’t transfer back to your house for another year even if he wished. Take advantage of this fact by draping your room and yourself with House gear. Say you’re suddenly swelling with—let’s just make something up—Pfoho pride* ahead of Housing Day. Your blockmate will just have to accept that argument while at the same time you’ll have the pleasure of taunting him with all the things that he would be missing out on.**
*Attention freshman: Cabot, Currier, or Pfoho pride isn’t actually a thing. Don’t be fooled by what anyone else says. If they don’t have an advice column, they’re wrong.
**Again freshman: the blockmate wouldn’t be missing out on much.

Remember that "high-profiled dignitary" that HUPD emailed about? Well, tomorrow, Wednesday, March 5, President Obama will be in town, aka The Leader of the Free World, for the afternoon to attend a "DNC Roundtable" at 4:50 p.m. at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square.
Before you sprint down JFK, note that this is not an open event. According to Boston Magazine, the event will have 25 attendees, each of whom have donated up to $32,400 to the Democratic Party. In return, they will discuss plans to raise the national minimum wage at a roundtable, as well as President Obama's executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal employees in 2015.
Parts of JFK Street and Memorial Drive will be closed from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. tomorrow due to vehicle traffic (read: Look out for the presidential motorcade!).
If you don't catch a glimpse of Obama at the Charles Hotel, he will also deliver remarks concerning the minimum wage at 2:30 p.m. at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, Connecticut. After the roundtable, he will speak and answer questions at a DNC dinner at the Artists for Humanity EpiCenter in Boston at 7:20 p.m.
And then maybe he'll visit his alma mater? Please?
