After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On sunny days in Harvard Yard, when the light of autumn leaves pop orange, maroon, vibrant yellow, and a fading green, and the tower on Memorial Church reflects bright white back to me, I picture myself in an admissions brochure. Touting an aggressively crimson sweater, I walk slightly stiffly. Around me are piles of dead leaves fallen from shedding male oaks. Posing, I pick up a batch and launch it into the air above me. As the rotting leaves fall around me, I laugh with my chest and smile a little too wide and tilt my head slightly, angling myself for some camera or the people who watch me — a brown face in a sea of white ones.
If all the world’s a stage, Harvard is one too. On my first day here, among other things, I found in my freshman welcome packet some metaphorical script, statements on a “commitment to diversity and inclusion” in pamphlets with people of various shades. Highlighted were the lines I was expected to read out to the world: “Students of color contribute so much to this community …”, “Bridging divides across experiences is vital...”, “There is so much to learn from diversity….” Overwhelmed and confused by its contents and the bustling energy of freshman move-in, I skimmed my lines quickly and threw the script haphazardly onto my dorm room desk, where it would soon get lost amongst syllabi, textbooks, flyers, and the other things I imagined would open new worlds for me.
Within two hours, in conversation with a white entryway-mate who was curious about my thoughts on DuBois’s “Souls of Black Folk,” I heard, in my voice, lines from that fated script. I had barely cracked open our assigned summer reading, let alone developed a cohesive thought on theories of racial uplift, and yet here I was, “speaking as a woman of color….”
The trend continued. I checked privilege, I pushed back, I diversified rooms, and soon into the school year, my vocabulary started and ended on the pages of that script. I fell quickly into the role of Indignant Student Activist, one which I had been assigned by nature of my various identities and the color of my skin, and my existence became, in James Baldwin’s words, one of “bitter railing.”
On cloudy days, the illusion fades. The Yard looks more dull now and mud coats the leaves as they fall to the ground. The looming threat of a challenge to Harvard’s admissions practices has sent the people who set this stage into a whirling panic. I watch silently as administrators scramble to protect the sanctity of “diversity,” and the emails that appear in my inbox from the highest offices of this institution sound almost like a competition of who can scream “WE NEED PEOPLE OF COLOR” the loudest. Surveying the chaos that has unfolded, I chuckle and can’t help but wonder what all of this is for. Why are these directors so determined to cast us? What are the meanings of the roles that they want us to fill? And why have we clung to them?
I spent two years at Harvard reading the lines they’d written for me. For two years, my existence in this institution served as a “necessary” and “healthy” challenge. During various meetings with students and College staff, I was asked to push this institution forward, but only as far as their script would allow. White folks asked me constantly to help them empathize with the struggles of students of color: “Show me why I should care! Teach me how to be human!”
I, the Indignant Student Activist, was, as Baldwin writes, as “a mirror of our confusion, dishonesty, panic,” giving white people a space to reflect on the horrid realities of the consequences of their actions and inactions. Interacting with me was a transformative experience transactionalized, and I, in this space, internalized the dehumanization others placed on me, denying my own complexity, my own humanity.
I tried for some time to find my fulfillment in the acts of resisting, but as Baldwin taught me in “Everybody’s Protest Novel,” true liberation cannot come from the formation of an identity in opposition to the systems and structures that limit me. “We take our shape, it is true, within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth; and yet it is precisely through our dependence on this reality that we are most endlessly betrayed.”
In adhering to my script, I lived in half-truths in order to make my striving for half-victories more efficient; but beneath the words that are given to me lies my frightening truth, which I have subjected to silence because it cannot not fit into their narrative of protest.
These gates have trapped me in their construction. In these confines, I’ve muffled the difficult questions that bring me closer to my complicated human nature: What of my fragile blackness? And my shameful lack of rhythm? And my capacity, or lack thereof, to love? And my experience of faith? And loneliness? And joy?
If our defense of diversity ultimately legitimizes the sentimentalities around race of this stage that we inhabit, I’ll have no part in it. I want to imagine a world beyond this one, where the truths in my body dance effortlessly and I laugh lightly and I speak with integrity to my complexities and, with ease, love the whole of myself — a world in which I am liberated. For “our humanity is our burden, our life; we need not battle for it; we need only do what is infinitely more difficult — that is, accept it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though University President Lawrence S. Bacow was only officially installed as president of Harvard University weeks ago, he has already created long-term plans to ensure the success of the University. More specifically, Bacow, an economist by training, has challenged all Harvard schools to engage in “scenario planning” for the next recession. Though the U.S. economy is currently booming, Bacow has repeatedly warned that a recession is inevitable and that it is crucial to prepare for it. We commend Bacow for his foresight and wholeheartedly agree with his decision to plan ahead for a potential economic downturn in the future.
The focus on preparing for an economic downturn is especially necessary given Harvard’s history and the current political climate. During the Great Recession in 2008, Harvard quickly found itself in a precarious position, most notably indicated by an $11 billion single-year loss in the endowment. The recession also delayed the construction of the new Allston campus, froze faculty hiring in the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, caused layoffs for hundreds of University employees, and delayed the kickoff of the capital campaign. These losses led to long-term setbacks that Harvard still has not recovered from. Harvard’s endowment growth is still lower than almost all of the rest of our peer institutions in the Ivy League. With the recent imposition of the federal endowment tax, Harvard’s precarious economic situation is even more clear. As such, a downturn as dramatic as what the University underwent in the last recession would simply be unacceptable.
When planning for the next recession, we encourage the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, as well as other divisions of the University, not only to be pragmatic in their plans, but also to prioritize that which makes Harvard excellent. Recessions often result in faculty hiring freezes, and though certain cuts may be unavoidable, Harvard’s schools should be as frugal as possible in order to ensure this doesn’t happen. Ideally, a recession should not limit the academic experiences of students.
Most importantly, a recession should not limit who has access to Harvard. Specifically, we strongly urge the University to maintain financial aid as a top priority regardless of what economic pressures may arise. Recessions and economic downturns often affect students’ ability to pay, and this may be especially true for low-income students. In this time, it is crucial for Harvard to maintain a strong financial aid program that can continue to support a diverse class.
It is also crucial for the University to strengthen these programs now, so that there is no danger of them being cut in the future. Students are the lifeblood of Harvard, a place whose mission it is to educate the best and the brightest. In order to do so, Harvard must remain a university that all students have equal access to, and must remain an institution that can attract all students, irrespective of their backgrounds.
Regardless of when the next recession is and how much of an economic downturn is coming, we are pleased to see University leaders are planning pragmatically for the future. We hope that in their plans, they continue to prioritize the academic experiences of all students. Harvard should always remain an institution where all students know that they can attend and receive the highest quality of education.

This November, Massachusetts will be the latest state to face the question of civil rights at the ballot box. Nondiscrimination protections that have, since 2016, protected transgender people from discrimination in public places are at risk of being repealed by voters. This vote, and the debates leading up to it, have a very real impact on the lives, and deaths, of transgender people like me.
In addition to being a student at Harvard Divinity School and an occasional civil rights lawyer, I also serve as the executive director of Trans Lifeline, a national suicide prevention organization that includes a crisis and peer support hotline run for trans people, by trans people. I’ve been fortunate enough to live in Massachusetts on and off for the last few years and to call Harvard a second home. From Boston to Greenfield, I’ve seen firsthand how trans people are contributing to the communities, schools, and houses of worship they call home, and I understand them when they tell me they can’t imagine living anywhere else. I’ve also seen the very real lives at risk when we talk about civil rights from a place of fear rather than respect.
One of the extraordinary things about our crisis hotline is that, in addition to providing lifesaving services to trans people, it gives us a real-time barometer of the impact current events are having on the mental health of our people. In the last four months, calls to Trans Lifeline from Massachusetts phone numbers have increased by two to four times, even accounting for nationwide trends. Putting the civil rights of a vulnerable population to a vote has consequences.
Campaign ads that stoke fear about trans people in bathrooms pose a far greater threat to our lives than trans people pose to anyone with whom we share a public accommodation. Trans people — especially trans youth, who are at particularly high risk for mental health impacts — are listening to these messages. Studies indicate that around 40 percent of trans people have attempted suicide, compared with less than 5 percent of the general public. A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that over half of transmasculine youth (trans youth assigned female at birth but who identify as more masculine than feminine) report at least one attempt. The relentless hostility, discrimination, and bullying those kids face may not show up on their faces, but they show up on our hotline.
What’s more, these arguments are demonstrably false. The leading safety experts in the state — including the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence, the Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, and others — are all urging voters to vote yes on Question 3. Here at Harvard Divinity School, which has both a trans-inclusive nondiscrimination policy and gender-neutral bathrooms, we’ve been training future faith leaders of many genders side by side for years without incident. While there has been no increase in harassment in bathrooms since the state nondiscrimination law was passed, the absence of public accommodation protections puts trans people at acute risk for harassment there. Repealing this law would not make a single person safer, but it would make some of the most vulnerable lives in Massachusetts even more vulnerable.
At Trans Lifeline, we don’t just see the hard stuff. We also see how resilient the trans community is, how important nondiscrimination protections are to keeping us safe, how lifesaving it is to feel supported by friends and family, and how far even small acts of love, kindness, and respect can go. We see the extraordinary emotional and spiritual resilience of people who refuse to give up their own humanity. We see how much hate trans people face, but we also see what is possible when we are able to live authentic lives with the same safety, privacy, and dignity as everyone else.
I urge all members of the Harvard community to register today and vote yes on 3 this November. Voting yes on 3 preserves the freedom of all Massachusetts residents, including transgender ones, to live their lives free from discrimination. It ensures that dignity and respect continue to be Massachusetts values. And, maybe most importantly, it sends a message to the people calling our hotline that they are welcome in the state they call home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The popular “Classroom to Table” program — a College initiative that funds meals between undergraduates and faculty members around Harvard Square — re-opened its registration portal for the fall 2018 semester this past Monday.
Program administrator Kara-Sue D. Sweeney said students and faculty can now submit advance requests via the sign-up form on the Classroom to Table website. Administrators will fund gatherings that take place on Oct. 26 or later, she said.
Since its debut in 2015, Classroom to Table has exploded in popularity. Last semester, the program burned through its yearly budget by early April, forcing its premature cessation — even after officials set a cap of two dinners per student. At the time, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that administrators planned to prioritize finding funding for the program going forward.
In an email, Sweeney noted that “Classroom to Table” is constrained by finite resources. He did not specify this year's budget.
“Program funding will be limited and we may not be able to accommodate all requests,” Sweeney wrote.
According to the program's website, “Classroom to Table” will continue to provide up to $30 per person to cover meals with a faculty member at one of six designated Harvard Square restaurants: Grafton Street, Park Restaurant, Russell House Tavern, the Hourly Oyster House, and Temple Bar. Any group of three to five students is eligible to receive funding for a lunch or dinner.
Tamara Shamir ’21, who participated in the program last fall, said she looks forward to submitting a Classroom to Table request in the next few weeks.
“I think Classroom to Table does kind of break down the formality barrier that you face in class, and so conversations naturally flow more easily,” Shamir said.
Joseph K. Blitzstein, a Harvard professor known around campus for teaching the popular Statistics 110: “Introduction to Probability,” said he hopes the program will raise sufficient funds to remain open for longer this year.
“Classroom to Table is a fantastic program, which provides opportunities for students and faculty to have engaging conversations outside of the usual classroom and office hour settings, in some outstanding Harvard Square restaurants,” Blitzstein said.

Harvard's Athletics Department has debuted 23 new initiatives for student athletes as part of a larger umbrella program titled "Crimson360" and meant to reflect the department's revamped motto of "principled leadership, academic integration and competitive excellence."
Crimson360, which kicked off last month with a back-to-school barbecue, features a mix of new and existing trainings for student athletes along four broad themes: leadership, community building, life skills, and professional development. The department created three of the workshops included in Crimson360 in direct response to a months-long internal cultural review it undertook over the past year.
The Athletics Department launched a cultural review in spring 2017 after a series of high-profile scandals on the men’s soccer and cross country teams; members of both teams inappropriately rated their female counterparts for their looks and sexual appeal. Following the review, the department announced plans to implement mandatory sexual assault prevention and conflict resolution programs for athletes, unconscious bias trainings for Athletics staff and coaches, and “Diversity Dialogues” for the department as a whole.
The “Diversity Dialogues” and sexual assault prevention programs — as well as a “values-based leadership” program led by the National Consortium for Academics and Sports — make up three of the almost two dozen Crimson360 programs. Other initiatives are meant to help athletes to develop professional skills, refine their leadership abilities, and balance their workloads as student athletes.
Assistant Director of Athletics Andrea M. LaPointe, a founder of the Crimson360 program, wrotein an email that the department created Crimson360 to make student athletes more aware of resources available to them at Harvard.
“The majority of the programming is not brand new to Crimson360. We saw Crimson360 as a great way for student athletes to recognize what’s available to them,” LaPointe wrote. “Crimson360 will forever be evolving as we strive to add value to their student-athlete experience.”
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said in an interview this month that the new program is a “refinement” of past programs and embodies the department’s new focus on “principled leadership,” a term Scalise added to the department’s motto this year. He said all of the programs in Crimson360 are designed to equip student athletes to better recognize and respond to difficult situations.
“I just want everyone in our department to know that we're about principled leadership, academic integration and competitive excellence,” Scalise said. “We are going to do everything we can to try to prevent these things from happening, but in the event that something happens, how do we react?”
Some of the programs, such as the back-to-school barbecue and workshops for team captains, bring student athletes from different teams together to mingle and share ideas. Other trainings such as the sexual assault prevention program and the alcohol communication and education skills workshops are held on a team-by-team basis throughout the year.
Men’s tennis captain Andy T. Zhou ’19 said organized cross-team events help to forge a unified athletics community, which he said he didn’t think existed his first year in Cambridge.
“People were, across different teams, a little bit more disjointed,” Zhou said. “I think having the big intra-team events definitely helps to bring people and different teams close together. “
The sexual assault prevention and alcohol education trainings are the only Crimson360 programs that are required for all student-athletes. These mandatory workshops come in addition to other College-mandated trainings all undergraduates must complete.
LaPointe wrote that, though the department does not track participation rates for the optional programs, so far administrators have seen “great turnouts.”
Men’s fencing captain Eli Dershwitz ’18–’20 said, though he’s a third-year student athlete and second-year captain, he still finds the workshops useful.
“I’ve definitely felt that these captain leadership programs in general are very helpful not only because they give athletes of different teams the ability to you know, talk with the administration or talk with leaders on campus, but also it gives captains of different respective teams the ability to talk with each other about similar problems they face,” Dershwitz said.
When asked whether she would add any programs to the Crimson360 roster, women’s basketball captain Madeline M. Raster ’19 said she would launch a workshop to help seniors transition to post-graduate life.
“As a senior looking ahead, I think a really great one would be about transitioning as an athlete to a non-athlete as you graduate just because sports are a huge part of your life and a huge part of your identity,” Raster said.

The Harvard Kennedy School received $7.5 million for a student fellowship program for U.S. veterans and active duty military members Thursday, according to a press release from the school.
The donation, which came from the Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation, will cover attendance costs for up to 25 graduate students annually — starting with those matriculating in fall 2019 — across the Kennedy School, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Law School. Leon D. Black, who graduated from the Business School in 1975, is the founder of Apollo Global Management, a prominent New York-based private equity firm.
According to a Kennedy School press release, the gift is the largest donation made to Harvard in recent years specifically to fund the education of students who are current or former members of the U.S. military.
“The men and women who serve in the U.S. military play a critical role in maintaining global security and stability,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said in the press release. “This fellowship program will further the training and development of our military and veteran students, increasing their capabilities as leaders.”
The Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School will administer the fellowship program. The center recently appointed Wendy R. Sherman, a former U.S. under secretary of state for political affairs, to succeed David R. Gergen as the center’s director.
“Through the generosity of the Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation, a growing number of active duty and veteran students will be able to attend Harvard, affording them the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of today’s policy and national security challenges,” Gergen, who is also a Kennedy School professor, said in the statement.
According to the press release, around 250 veterans and active duty military members attend classes at Harvard each year. At the Kennedy School, which is known for its ties to national security and foreign policy circles, approximately 65 military students enroll in degree programs each year.
Elmendorf emphasized that, following graduation, many of these students take what they learn in Cambridge to work at the highest levels of government.
“Following their Harvard experience, these students often take the knowledge gained back into public service, making significant, positive contributions in a variety of roles,” Elmendorf said in the statement. “Several of our military and veteran alumni now serve in Congress as well as in other senior positions across the U.S. government and military.”
The Kennedy School is not the only one of Harvard’s professional schools with a significant military population. There are currently 84 military students enrolled at the Business School and more than 40 military students are enrolled at the Law School this year.
In the release, Black said the goal of the fellowship is to “promote ethical, values-based leadership and character.”
“Through the fellowship program, we can provide these talented emerging leaders with tools, focused preparation, and a vibrant network of peers and colleagues, establishing a strong and lasting foundation for future world-class public leadership,” Black said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal bill that could jeopardize Harvard’s controversial social group policy will almost certainly not become law before the end of this congressional term, experts say.
The bill — a suggested revision of the Higher Education Act called the PROSPER Act — contains a provision that would bar colleges and universities from penalizing students who join “recognized” single-gender social organizations. Though it is unclear whether that provision would apply to Harvard in its current form, opponents of the sanctions hope to change the wording to ensure that it affects the University.
If anti-sanctions advocates are successful and the bill passes, Harvard could be forced to choose between millions of dollars in federal research funding and its social group penalties.
The bill — voted out of the Committee on Education and the Workforce in the United States House of Representatives in Dec. 2017 — has not yet been scheduled to be discussed on the House floor or to be voted on by the full House.
The College’s sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, serving as the captains of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsements for certain prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
For now, it seems as if Harvard’s policy is pretty safe. Political analysts say the chances the Higher Education Act passes under this Congress are slim. Republicans, who introduced the bill and might be more likely to favor it, currently control the House of Representatives — but political pundits predict Democrats will regain the majority in November.
Neal McCluskey, director of the Cato Institute’s Center for Educational Freedom, said he does not think there is “any chance” the bill — which contains far more than the social groups provision — passes before the end of this term.
Supporting the bill would be “an act of political suicide,” according to Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.
He jokingly estimated the odds that the bill passes this term are “in negative territory.”
He and others pointed to the funding proposals in the bill as one main reason it will likely fail to become law. The PROSPER Act could reduce some students’ ability to receive Pell Grants to help them pay college tuition and could restrict the amount of money undergraduates can take out in student loans. Most Democrats oppose these provisions — and for Republicans, the legislation probably won't rank among their top priorities.
Whether universities can legally penalize social groups is of even less concern. Many lawmakers likely see the section on social groups as “a relatively minor provision” compared to larger issues related to financial aid, said Jeffrey Andrade, a lobbyist for the McKeon Group and former Republican staffer for the Committee on Education and the Workforce.
Still, Kelley McNabb, communications director for the Committee on Education and the Workforce, said the fact that the social group provision “appears in PROSPER indicates that lawmakers view this as a current and future significant issue.”
She declined to comment further on the bill’s chances of passing by the end of this Congress.
Another obstacle to passage could be that the bill's final club provision appears to contradict Republicans’ emphasis on limited government, according to some analysts.
“A conservative majority that constantly talks about governmental overreach and governmental micromanagement of private affairs probably shouldn't be chiseling rules in marble on matters as internal to the administration of colleges and universities as how they handle fraternities or Greek life or social organizations,” Nassirian said.
Drumming up support from representatives is not the only hurdle the PROSPER Act must clear to become law. Even if the bill advances out of the House of Representatives, the Senate would need to approve the legislation. The Senate has not finished drafting its version of the PROSPER Act.
Ultimately, the bill will likely garner mostly Republican support, experts said — meaning it would die in the House if Democrats take the majority. The Senate, meanwhile, is unlikely to flip blue. With a divided Congress, not much is likely to get done in Washington — especially when it comes to bills that have failed to garner much attention anyway.
Still, at least one group of lobbyists are staking their hopes on the bill. The Cambridge Coalition — comprising all-male final clubs the Fly Club, the AD Club, and the Porcellian Club, along with the Harvard chapters of fraternities Delta Kappa Epsilon, Sigma Chi, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon — sent representatives to the nation’s capital in spring 2018 to urge lawmakers to support the legislation and imperil the College's sanctions.
If the law does not pass, though, the fight for the fate of the social group policy could shift from the Hill to the courthouse. Some final club affiliates have previously said they would consider suing Harvard as a “last resort” to block the penalties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bridget Terry Long took the helm of the Harvard Graduate School of Education this summer at an inflection point for education around the country. U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos had discarded the Obama-era rule book on sexual assault policy and trumpeted school choice in primary and secondary education. The #MeToo movement had begun to hit academia. For the first time, the federal government passed a bill to levy taxes on some university endowments — a sign that higher education was under fire. A high-profile admissions lawsuit now in trial was challenging race-conscious admissions policies at Long's own institution.
Now, three months into her tenure as dean, Long is beginning to implement her vision at a time when the future of education in America is in flux.
Long assumed her position as dean on July 1, the same day University President Lawrence S. Bacow began his role. Long came into the deanship with prior Harvard experience under her belt. As the first black woman to lead the Ed School, Long previously served as a professor of education and economics at HGSE. She was appointed to the National Board for Education Sciences by President Obama in 2010, and has been awarded honors from numerous organizations, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Once in the new position, Long said she prioritized becoming acquainted with the unique challenges of the job.
“Realizing that I’m only in month three, I think it is important to first just kind of take stock,” Long said in a recent interview. “Any good leader, even if you’ve been within the institution, you’re going to take time to listen.”
While taking the time to listen to others, Long has also used her position of leadership to publicly respond to issues of national importance, including the recent confirmation process of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.
On Sept. 28, the day after Christine Blasey Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee alleging that Kavanaugh assaulted her when the two were in high school, Long emphasized in an email to HGSE affiliates the importance of universal respect. Long and Maritza S. Hernandez, an Ed School associate dean, wrote that all individuals have the right to live “free of harassment and unwanted attention or harm.”
“We also want all of you to know that you can find support here at HGSE,” they wrote. The email also listed resources both inside and outside of Harvard that individuals can consult if they have experienced sexual harassment or abuse.
Not all Harvard deans issued public statements in response to the hearings. John F. Manning ’82, dean of the Law School, stayed silent throughout the proceedings, earning criticism from some students. He eventually sent an email to Law School calling the preceding weeks an “extraordinarily painful and divisive chapter” in American history.
Long said she was unaware of any discussion among central administrators on what, if anything, to communicate to students and affiliates regarding the hearings or sexual assault more generally. Explaining her motivations behind the public message, Long said she believes she has the responsibility to speak out about the values of the institution she represents.
“The advice I’ve been given by many senior leaders both at Harvard and elsewhere is to speak out when you feel that the values of the institution are being put in jeopardy or need to be re-emphasized. And so that's what I did, because I knew that there were people who were hurting,” Long said.
Long said, however, that in her new administrative role, she has been conscious of the limitations of her voice in representing the totality of HGSE.
“It is my job to elevate [the student] voice…but it's not my job to speak for [the student],” Long said. “And so you have to walk this very careful line as dean to think carefully that, if you do speak, you could squash someone else's right to speak for themselves.”
Long has also been adamant about defending other institutional values that have recently come under attack. Among these is the ongoing affirmative action lawsuit against Harvard, which Long said poses a threat to the environment that the University has cultivated. According to Long, the benefits of diversity far outweigh the drawbacks of affirmative action policies.
“I know, as a faculty member, when you have a rich mixture of people in the classroom, the ideas that come out and the way that people bounce off of each other is just so much better versus if you just had the same kind of person, from the same kind of background, from the same kind of school,” Long said.
The Education School, she said, stands firmly in support of affirmative action.
“We have to have diversity if we are actually going to produce good outcomes,” Long said. “We have doubled down on taking that stance. We have reaffirmed it.”
Long said she also intends to concentrate efforts in addressing the stereotype that universities only benefit the elite. She said she thinks Harvard should focus more on countering this perception.
Because of the Ed School’s specific focus on education, it is one of the most outward-facing institutions at Harvard, Long said. Attacks on higher education, she said, come from a lack of awareness and understanding of the positive impacts of such programs.
“Our impact is in schools and communities and nonprofits that are elsewhere,” Long said. “So we're constantly proving the fact that there is value to what we're doing here.”
Expanding the reach of HGSE is one of Long’s main goals. The dean said she wants to further the reach of community partnerships, engagements with businesses, and programs for the public offered by HGSE.
Long’s recent trip to Detroit with Bacow is an example of one of these initiatives. Long said this trip represents the beginning of many conversations between Harvard and various school districts, community organizations, and local foundations about their needs and how Harvard can help. According to Long, the needs of these institutions and areas could lead to mutually beneficial partnerships.
Long said one challenge for Harvard in getting “out in the world,” as she puts it, is that the University does not have a consolidated network of interconnected partners and alumni. By bringing these people together, Long said she thinks that Harvard can do better in giving back to communities.
“When it was announced that President Bacow was going to go to Michigan, we started to realize how many alumni are in Michigan and how we touched so many different parts of the communities there,” Long said. “We have to think much more about that, and use those networks and partnerships to be bigger than just what we are here in Cambridge or Allston or Longwood area, but where we are all over the world.”
On top of these challenges, Long said the field of education must also continue to address structural inequalities. She said while there are exciting new developments in the field of education science, such as cutting-edge technology and an advanced biological and psychological understanding of a young person’s brain, not every student is able to benefit from such innovations.
“So many students, so many kids, so many families, communities, and adults aren't getting what we know right now to be a good quality, a high quality education,” Long said.
The challenge, according to Long, is overcoming social inequities.
“While we have the best and brightest and most innovative kinds of ideas circling, we are having trouble providing that to all students, of all ages, and all communities," Long said.
“So lots of work to be done,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
So many students have tried to sell their College-allotted tickets to the Harvard-Yale football game this year — a violation of Athletics Department policy that typically goes unnoticed and unpunished — that some resident deans have begun admonishing students over internal House email lists.
The Harvard ticketing website states that “Undergraduates can claim one ticket for their personal use. No guest tickets will be available for sale. Students may not sell their claimed ticket to a member of the general public or other students.”
“We take this [policy] seriously and expect our students to comply,” Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an emailed statement.
Despite the policy, at least a hundred students have attempted to sell their tickets for amounts ranging from $25 to over $200. Most advertised their tickets on House email lists or on a public Facebook event page.
Maxwell K. Ho ’21 offered his ticket up for $115 “OBO” — slang for “or best offer” — over the Eliot House email list. He said he was unaware Harvard forbids resale.
“In my one year of experience, the game was the least fun part of the entire fiasco,” Ho said. “The $50 plus is worth a lot more to me as someone who is strapped for cash. I'd rather use that money to go to a restaurant or something of the like with my friends.”
Aside from financial motivations, students attributed the spike in ticket scalping to the fact that this year, in a break with tradition, the Game will be played not in Harvard Stadium but in Fenway Park. And, unlike in the Stadium, Harvard undergraduates will face strict ticketing rules in the famed Boston baseball shrine.
Fenway Park policy stipulates that all students must sit in assigned seats during The Game. If students wanted to sit with a particular group of friends, they had to pick up game tickets together as a group.
So far, undergraduates do not appear particularly pleased with new rules. Students previously complained to administrators that Fenway's rules are inconvenient and deleterious to the overall experience.
“If they’re forcing us to do all of this assigned seating, then they should know that the outcome is that people are going to want to sell their tickets,” Guadalupe M. Jacobson-Peregrino ’21 said. “People are going to want to sell and buy tickets so that they can all sit together. It’s just an outcome that was destined to happen once the Fenway Park assigned seating happened.”
After noticing online chatter about ticket sales, a number of resident deans sent nearly identical emails to students reminding them that ticket resale violates University policy.
Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers wrote in an email to her House that “students who attempt to sell tickets may even be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct.”
The Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct did not respond to requests for comment.
In her email, Chavers underscored The Game’s role in fostering a sense of community among Harvard students.
“Instead of being an anonymous resource that you are free to dispose of as you wish, the purpose of offering each student one ticket is to provide an opportunity for you to build your community and enjoy school spirit together,” she wrote.
Some students said the ticketing rules specific to Fenway Park have already eroded a sense of community. They suggested ticket resale might help restore it.
“Let’s say if someone from Harvard isn’t going to the game, and there’s a friend of yours whose friend is coming to Harvard and wants to get a feel of Harvard, then that’s a perfect opportunity, just give him your ticket,” Mustafa Bal ’19 said. “Give it or sell it; work it out with him. I don’t think that’s a big deal. That shouldn’t be a big deal.”
Chavers and other resident deans also reminded students that the free tickets are a “gift,” though some students said they disagreed with that idea.
“There’s a feeling that they’re not gifted to us. They’re part of our tuition probably, somewhere in there,” Ilan M. Goldberg ’20 said. “Not in a spoiled way.”
By contrast, Yale undergraduates must pay $25 per ticket.
Jacobsen-Peregrino said the new ticket policy and the sale of those tickets over email lists marks a departure from a storied Harvard tradition.
“You take one part of the tradition and it feels like everything starts to crumble,” she said. “I think it’s disheartening to the administration because they see all of these kids who would rather make money off of tickets then go to a game where they can’t sit with their friends.”

Over a nearly two-decade period starting in 1995, Asian-American applicants to Harvard saw the lowest acceptance rate of any racial group that applied to the school, according to data presented in court Thursday as part of the Harvard admissions trial.
Data for that time period — which begins with the admissions cycle for applicants to Harvard’s Class of 2000 and ends with the cycle for the Class of 2017 — show that Asian-American candidates on average saw an admission rate of 8.1 percent. By comparison, white applicants saw an average acceptance rate of 11.1 percent in that time period, African-American applicants saw an average acceptance rate of 13.2 percent, and Hispanic-American applicants saw an average acceptance rate of 10.6 percent.
The data surfaced during court testimony when Harvard’s lead trial lawyer William F. Lee ’72 stepped up to continue his marathon questioning of the College’s long-serving Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. Thursday marked the fourth day of the trial; Fitzsimmons has testified each day for several hours since proceedings kicked off Monday.
Note: Overall admissions rate also includes Native American/Native Hawaiian, International, and Unknown/Other students.
The trial, expected to last for at least three weeks, is the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit that alleges Harvard illegally discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions filed suit against the University in 2014. Experts have said that — should the case wind up before the Supreme Court — it could decide the fate of race-conscious admissions in the United States.
The dataset Lee presented Thursday, which appears to be sourced from internal Harvard records, breaks down College applicants into eight categories: white, Asian-American, African-American, Hispanic-American, Native-American/Native-Hawaiian, international citizen, “Other,”and “Unknown.”
Charts displayed on three pages of the 16-page dataset detail the number of applicants and the number of admits belonging to each racial group for 18 Harvard admission cycles starting in 1995. The Crimson calculated yearly admit rates for each demographic group.
The analysis showed that Native-American and Native-Hawaiian students saw an average acceptance rate of 10.4 percent in that time period — but the statistic is likely less meaningful given the relatively small pool of applicants hailing from those racial backgrounds. Significantly fewer Native Americans and Native Hawaiians applied to the College each year than did members of other racial groups.
On average, 4,910 Asian-American, 1,938 African-American, 2,082 Hispanic-American, and 8,685 white students applied to Harvard in any given year included in the dataset. Just 233 Native-American and Native Hawaiian students did the same.
Harvard is typically tight-lipped about anything related to its famously secretive admissions process, though the College’s admissions office does publish the racial demographics of its admitted classes each year.
But it has never before released as detailed a breakdown as the one Lee unveiled Thursday.
The average acceptance rate overall during the time period covered by the dataset clocked in at 9.3 percent. Asian-Americans were the only racial group whose acceptance rate dips below that average.
The numbers also show how the pool of prospective applicants to Harvard has changed since the mid-1990s.
From 1994 to 2014, Harvard saw a 257 percent increase in applications from African-American students and a 208 percent increase in applications from Hispanic-American students. The number of Asian-American applicants increased by 94 percent and the number of white applicants increased by 63 percent.
The acceptance rates for every single racial group decreased during that time period — consistent with the fact that the Harvard admissions process has grown increasingly competitive in recent years. In 2018, the College saw an acceptance rate below 5 percent for the first time in school history.
But the acceptance rates for all racial groups did not fall at the same rate. African-American applicants saw the steepest decline — their acceptance rates fell by 12.4 percentage points over 18 years. In the 1995-1996 admissions cycle, 19.2 percent of African-American Harvard hopefuls earned a spot at the College; in the 2012-2013 cycle, just 6.8 percent of African-American applicants did so.
Hispanic-Americans saw the second-steepest decline of 8.9 percentage points, while white students saw a decline of 5.4 percentage points. Asian-American applicants saw the smallest decrease: their acceptance rate fell by just 3.6 percentage points in that time period.
The overall decline in acceptance rates for all students measured 5.6 percentage points.
The relatively large decrease in acceptance rates for African-American and Hispanic-American applicants likely reflects the fact that Harvard has increased its outreach efforts to communities of color over the past few years. Admissions officers regularly conduct “extensive outreach to minority applicants” as part of the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, according to Harvard-submitted court documents.
Overall, the data shows, admit rates for applicants of all races have grown increasingly similar over the past two decades or so. And all racial group-specific acceptance rates have inched closer to Harvard’s overall acceptance rate.
The trial is slated to continue Friday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on Thursday, reflecting on his experiences pursuing peace in Colombia and offering advice for attendees in light of the current international political climate.
In the week leading up to the event, Santos has been “very active,” speaking with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and meeting with professors and students to talk about the successful Colombia peace negotiations, according to moderator Nicholas Burns, a Kennedy School professor and former United States ambassador to NATO.
In his speech Thursday evening, Santos declared the importance of fighting poverty and climate change. He also detailed lessons he learned throughout his varied career as a journalist, economist, Minister of Defense, and ultimately as president of Colombia from 2010 to 2018.
Santos, who was the sole recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016, offered the audience a glimpse into his battle for peace in Colombia. He highlighted the key role that other countries played in the peace process, adding that “support from the international community was crucial.”
“This is the first process where the victims of the war are put in the center of the solution of the negotiations,” Santos said. “Their rights to the truth, their rights to reparation, their rights to justice, their right to non-repetition — that became the pillars of the negotiation. No other agreement ever had done this before, so we had a test case and a precedent and what we’ve been doing the past few days [at Harvard] was to give it an academic context.”
Santos has a long history with Harvard. He attended the Kennedy School — where he spoke Thursday night — and graduated with a masters in public administration in 1981. He was also a Nieman Fellow in 1988. He said Thursday that he sought advice from Harvard during his term as president on the “academic” and “theoretical framework” within which he could anchor his peace efforts in Colombia. He currently serves as the Angelopoulos Global Public Leaders Fellow at the Kennedy School.
Among other subjects, Santos canvassed the crisis in Venezuela and his one-time aspiration to become a journalist. He also related a few personal anecdotes involving U.S. presidents that set almost the entire audience laughing.
Near the end of the talk, Santos offered a few words meant to inspire.
“This is something that I advise all of you to do: try to find a goal, try to find an objective, and fight for it and don’t get discouraged when you fail,” he said. “Stand up, and that makes life much more interesting, much more exciting, and much more fulfilling.”
After he finished, attendees quizzed the former head of state questions about his experience.
Ricardo I. Sutherland, a student at the MIT Sloan School of Management and a first-generation Colombian-American, said he was worried that predominately Afro-Latino and indigenous areas in Colombia are not receiving enough help. In an interview after the event, Sutherland said he was “ecstatic” Santos was here at Harvard because, “How often do you get to speak to a president and tell him where your family’s from?”
Valentin S. Arias, a student at the Kennedy School and president of the Harvard Colombian Student Society, said he looks forward to inviting more Latin-American leaders to Harvard who can add a perspective “for young leaders” that stretches beyond European and American experiences.
After the conversation, Burns said he hoped Harvard students will take away another message from the event: pursue public service.
“I really hope that all our students here at Harvard, College and grad, will think about public service… so we want to put men and women who are examples in front of our students,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With hundreds of thousands of spectators lining up along the Charles River, the Head of the Charles Regatta arrives in Cambridge this weekend. Thousands of boats will row along campus, bringing the event right into Harvard’s backyard. All four of the Crimson crew teams — women’s lightweight and heavyweight and men’s lightweight and heavyweight — will participate in the races.
The Head of the Charles is the first race of the season for the squads as they prepare to launch their 2018-2019 campaigns. As one of the largest races of the fall season, the Head of Charles presents an opportunity for the rowing world to reunite.
“We are kicking off another year. Your friends from around the rowing world all come to one place,” Butt said. “It is Boston in the fall so it is beautiful and everyone is excited about the prospects for the upcoming year.”
Junior women’s lightweight captain Maria Boyle relishes the environment presented by the Head of the Charles. She echoed Butt’s sentiments of general excitement for the start of the season.
“There is just so much activity that we call it ‘Rowing Christmas’ on our team just because it is super fun and is our first big showcase of our speed for the year,” Boyle said.
In addition, for Boyle and the rest of the women’s teams, the Head of the Charles also presents an added element of intrigue. Located along Memorial Drive, the women’s boathouse rests along the Charles River right in the middle of the racing action.
“The race is on our home course and so it is a pretty special time for us with our boathouse being the middle of the race exactly,” Boyle said. “There is so much going on and so many visiting teams.”
While the Head of the Charles generates excitement for both the teams and the surrounding Cambridge and Boston community, the intensity of rowing differs from that of the spring season. According to men’s lightweight coach Billy Boyce, the spring is the more competitive season.
“It’s really early in the year, and so it gets a lot of fanfare because it is a very visible event. It is the premier event of the fall, lots of spectators. So it gets a lot of excitement, but it is not that relevant come spring,” Boyce said. “So we train through it. We don’t put that much emphasis on it. Obviously on the day we will do our very best to get down the race course as fast as we can, but our goals are set toward the spring season. So we are approaching the year with that in mind, not with this event in mind.”
Men’s lightweight captain David Wexner emphasized Boyce’s views. For Wexner, the Head of the Charles creates an environment conducive to racing with the amount of spectators, especially those with Harvard affiliations.
“I think it is a nice event because no one is taking it too seriously. Obviously any time that we are out on the water we want to do as well as we can,” Wexner said. “But there is not a tremendous amount of pressure on it. It is just kind of a fun event.”
Compared to the spring season, the Head of the Charles is a completely different racing style. According to Boyle, the course not only is much longer in fall — 5,000 meters in autumn versus 2,000 meters in the spring — but the way in which the boats race is also completely different.
“The fall is head style, which basically means that you are doing time trials over the course. So one boat will go and a timer will start. Your time for the course will be recorded,” Boyle said. “While in the spring you are all lined up and then they say ‘ready, set, go’ and all the boats go off at once. So you can see how you are doing relative to the other boats.”
With these differences, the Head of the Charles does not represent much for the teams as they look ahead to the competitive season in the spring. Rather, the race provides the opportunity to have rowing in the spotlight.
Last year at the race, both lightweight teams placed third in the eights division. According to Boyce, while the teams always want to win at the Head of the Charles, these finishes are rarely indicative of what is to come later in the spring season. For the Crimson, the performance was fairly consistent last season as the men’s lightweight team also placed third at Nationals.
“Teams that place at the Head of Charles sometimes do not place at all come spring, sometimes vice-versa, sometimes it is about steady. For us last year, it just so happened that we were third at the Charles and we were third at the Nationals,” Boyce said. “Past [champions] have gone to miss the medals in the spring or teams that haven’t won medals at the Head of the Charles have gone to win the whole thing in the spring.”
According to Wexner, in general there is a lot of a variation with which schools have the best time for any given race. This variation makes it difficult to predict how a race will go on any given weekend.
“With a lot of these events, the competition varies a lot year to year,” Wexner said. “So going off of rank or even times with the weather being so variable too, it is hard to get a picture of how crews are doing. We are hoping to keep it building.”
While the Head of the Charles is not their most competitive race, the teams are still looking forward to racing this weekend. For Wexner, the fanfare surrounding the Head of the Charles makes the race something to look forward as it opens the season.
“I think this is a lot more fun. You have the whole weekend with boats going off all the time,” Wexner said. “I think the team has been practicing hard and is excited to have a chance at racing this weekend. Definitely a lot more to come this year so this is kind of a fun stop along the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a frigid February day in Cambridge, and Harvard students are easing into the spring term while winter keeps the weather in a vice grip. The Charles River has just thawed, and it finally looks more like a body of water than a hockey rink.
Most of the student body is inside. Kids are sipping hot chocolate, watching Netflix, or catching up with friends. Not Drake Deuel. The sophomore lightweight rower is headed to the water to train.
He’s down on the dock, frozen fingers fumbling with the oarlocks on his shell. He doesn’t tighten one of them properly. He slides his vessel off of the landing and takes a couple strokes. Then the oarlock gives way and Deuel tumbles into the river as his paddle floats away.
He’s eventually fished out of the river by an onlooker. He’s mad at himself, shaken but okay. The crew team is banned from the water for a month.
“My face was purple,” he recalls.
The Charles River gets pretty cold in the middle of winter, and it’s a small wonder Deuel emerged unscathed from the incident. His teammates think he downplays the episode too much.
“It was a near-death experience,” says Owen Niles, a sophomore on the crew team and a close friend of Deuel’s.
But the accident, Niles points out, was a direct product of Deuel’s commitment to his craft. The same passion that dumped Deuel into an icy waterway fuels him when spurs his squad to victories in regattas. The Texan wanted to be out on the river at the earliest possible instant he could, and unfortunately his day didn’t go as planned.
As much as Deuel loves to be outside, he is perhaps an even more impressive athlete inside the walls of his training facilities. Last year, Deuel set the lightweight erg half marathon world record. (An erg, or ergometer, is a special kind of rowing machine that tracks distances and times to simulate rowing on dry land.) And he didn’t just break the previous mark. He shattered it by more than a minute. He also briefly held the 10,000 meter record, but he was narrowly beaten by Maxwell Lattimer, a Canada native and 2016 Olympian.
Deuel’s teammates laud his incredible work ethic, and there is even a forum on Reddit devoted to emulating Deuel’s “training strategy” — incidentally, that thread calls Deuel “one of the best pound for pound rowers in recent memory. Such anonymous and high praise is rare for college athletes.
But Deuel cares about much more than what he can accomplish in the gym at the Newell Boathouse. He is foremost a member of the Harvard team and only secondarily an individual achiever. He takes failure hard.
“The most difficult moment of my collegiate rowing journey so far has to be our race last spring against Yale and Princeton,” Deuel remembers. “It was the final race of the regular season, and we came in undefeated as the top-ranked boat in the league with a lot of pressure and high expectations on our shoulders. Losing that race and feeling that you’ve let down the other eight...people in your boat is a crushing low. [If] you win together, you also lose together.”
That journey hasn’t always been easy. Fans usually only see the end product in athletics, and what intervenes between the honeymoon of beginning and the euphoria of achievement isn’t always pretty.
“[Growing into the team culture] was certainly a difficult transition for me, as I came in to the team in good form after a summer of primarily rowing and was put straight to the top of our team’s rankings.” Deuel recalls. “It’s a long season though, and as the spring reached its conclusion many of the more experienced guys on the team [really improved] on their fitness, and I ended up not making the cut for our top boat in our last race of the year. It was a humbling experience and one that I’ve learned a lot from."
The Dallas sophomore doesn’t dwell on the past, though. He has his sights set on lofty goals, and if his past record is any indication, he looks poised to achieve them. He’s eyeing the 2020 Olympics, and he has been training with an older Harvard alumnus on his own in order to pursue that dream. He’s clearly competitive at that level; he lost his record to Lattimer by a mere 0.8 seconds.
There are more immediate matters, however. The Head of the Charles is on Deuel’s mind, and while it takes place during the less serious fall season, it still holds an important position in the story of a year for lightweight crew.
“The Head of the Charles has been a highlight for me over my time rowing, with this year being the 4th time that I’ll have raced the event,” Deuel said.“The Charles River has a storied past, and coming from Texas it was a special experience racing on this river [that is] the center of rowing in the U.S. Now that I live here and row on the river every day, the race has taken on a different character, and I appreciate that this event allows us to hopefully share that special atmosphere with the community at large.”
And lest an observer get the impression that Deuel is nothing but an uber-intense rower, his teammates report that he has a fun side.
“I came into college thinking, ‘Oh, this guy’s the fastest lightweight in the country, and he’s probably going to be so pretentious and stuck-up about it, and he’s just going to ignore everybody else and do his own thing,’” Niles said. “But in reality, Drake is also just a normal, cool person.”
The two rowers share an unexpected common interest: cooking. Deuel has a known fondness for Blue Apron recipes, and he likes to prepare his own meals. Niles says that his friend also spends a non-negligible amount of time on Reddit scrolling through cat memes. Those two activities aren’t exactly what come to mind with respect to the stereotype of the college crew star, but clearly his teammates aren’t just blowing smoke when they credit Deuel for his humility and normalcy.
In short, Deuel is a remarkable rower, but he is a beloved teammate too. He’s looking ahead to years of difficult training, but he hopes they will pay off. And, of course, he has his fingers crossed that he won’t go on any more unplanned swimming outings in the Charles.

The plaques from past victories line the walls of the “Bat Cave,” serving as daily reminders of the Harvard rowing program’s long-time greatness. All-Ivy athletes, national team members, and even Olympic medalists have sat, learned, and talked in this imposing room.
The coxswains for the Harvard-Radcliffe women’s lightweight crew appreciate the program’s greatness, but remain unintimidated.
“We’re a pretty unique squad because all of us are walk-ons,” junior coxswain Juliet Pesner said. “Claire [Burch] and I walked-on at the same time in our freshman year, so two years ago.”
Aside from freshman coxswain Mary Kolesar, who coxed in high school but was not recruited, all the coxswains were completely new to rowing when they first set foot inside Weld Boathouse along the Charles River.
Today, they are each part of the team.
Coxswains are much more than just a set of eyes for a boat full of backward-facing rowers. In practice and in races, a coxswain serves as the in-boat liaison for the coaches.
“You’re responsible for steering in races and in practices, and in practices you’re responsible for running drills and taking the team through the motions in practice, and keeping the practice efficient,” Pesner said. “And during races, you’re responsible for giving them [the rowers] all the information that they won’t have because they’re rowing backwards.”
Navigation, though, is not an impromptu action of steering around obstacles and turns. Planning the right course is a process that begins days or even weeks before the big day.
“One thing that I like to do is spend a lot of time just looking at physical maps of the course and drawing lines on them to show what covers the shortest distance,” Pesner said. “It’s not like something you calculate — even though Claire [Burch, a physics concentrator,] probably has. But, yeah, seeing what the tightest lines are, there’s kind of conventional wisdom about it.”
The Head of the Charles provides a unique advantage to the host’s teams because it takes place on Harvard’s home course.
“We’re fortunate that, for such a big race, it’s [a course] that we’re on every single day,” Burch said.
Stellar coaching also plays a part in planning the best course, especially for races in unfamiliar waters. The toughest comes with how much and how quickly to steer the boat.
“It’s a lot about the turns — figuring out where the big turns are, where you need to start the turns, how to get through the bridges on the turns, navigate other boats,” senior Krista Anderson said.
In addition to steering, coxswains are also tasked with keeping morale up during the dregs of a race’s three- or four-mile coordinated sprint. Rowing is akin to a 20-minute three-legged race, except with four or even eight participants instead of just two.
“Some of the most motivating things are hearing where you are on other boats, and what’s called walking through another boat, which is when you go from being behind them to all the way out ahead of them, and some people would say, ‘picking people off,’” Burch said.
Keeping the entire boat of rowers alert and in sync is crucial to a crew’s success. The falter of a single rower’s stroke can cause the entire boat to, in rowing parlance, “catch a crab.” Any crab requires the boat to stop and restart rowing, and a particularly forceful crab can even eject a rower.
All these motivating efforts require heavy thought, energy, practice, and rehearsal from the coxswain. Like quarterbacks watching tape after a football game, coxswains often listen to in-race tapes of what they said and how they said it.
“I think when I first started coxing, I had no idea how much you could possibly think about the words that came out of your mouth,” Pesner said. “You listen to recordings of yourself during your race — for example, you think about down to the individual word, what were the words that were most effective, what was not effective, what do you listen to yourself say and kind of cringe — cause it happens, where you’re like, ‘Why did I say that, that wasn’t motivating at all!’”
Because of the heavy impact of their words on the rowers, vocal health is imperative to coxswain success.
“You’ve got to keep your voice in good shape, [and] you’ve got to keep your throat in good shape,” Burch said.
Although coxswains today use a voice-amplifying “cox box,” the heat of the moment can still bring significant vocal strain and the occasional loss of voice.
“When you get, like, really excited and you’re in a race situation, [yelling] just kind of happens naturally,” Pesner said. “It’s not even something I think about that much.”
Despite the high level of commitment required from coxswains every day, from charting out the shortest route and brainstorming improved motivational tricks and phrases, to meeting with coaches and exercising with the team, life for coxswains does not start and end at the boathouse.
“I like doing visual arts a lot, like painting and sketching,” said freshman Mary Kolesar, the newest addition to Harvard’s coxswain squad.
Burch even brings some of her non-coxing life to practice every day and enjoys exploring the intersection of her extracurricular and academic interests.
“I do physics research, and I always try to bring in a little bit of that hydrodynamics to practices, to varied success,” Burch said. “Thinking about shifting your center of mass during parts of the stroke in a way that will keep the majority of your momentum toward its bow and sort of offset that inertial movement the least. So I do try to kind of talk to them about these things.”
The coxswains appreciate the diversity of their group and of the team in general.
“I think one of the coolest things about our team is that everyone is an incredible athlete and really focused on the sport, but everyone comes from a really wide array of places on campus,” Pesner said.
This April, Burch led the Harvard third varsity eight to a victory over Princeton by 0.548 seconds at the Eastern Sprints Championships after falling to the Tigers earlier in the month. Perhaps Harvard rowing’s improved knowledge of hydrodynamics made the difference.

Moscow was colder than the women in black had expected.
The Radcliffe crew team had just landed in Russia for crew’s premier competition, the 1973 European Rowing Championships. Two months before, the women had cruised down the Schuylkill to win the national championship, clinching the right to represent the United States in Moscow. The team, having formed a mere two years prior, was certainly not expected to come out of Philadelphia victorious. Nevertheless, a combination of determination and hard work propelled the women to the world’s podium, a stage on which summertime temperatures were dropping below 50 degrees.
“We were wearing a very ragtag collection of warmups, the kind we all wore to practice,” said Charlotte Crane ’73, a senior on the team at the time. “However, we were told [by officials] that we could not practice unless we had matching uniforms, which the men had, but we didn’t. We actually had to ask the men for the turtlenecks from their dress uniforms so we’d have warm-ups to wear.”
That story best sums up how the Radcliffe crew team was treated at the time: underfunded, disrespected, and unexpected.
Radcliffe College was officially founded in 1879 as the female companion to the all-male Harvard College. The two schools remained separate until the 1960s, at which point the women’s college began to merge with Harvard, a process that was formally completed in 1999. Today, pieces of Radcliffe can still be seen on Harvard’s campus. There’s the Radcliffe Quadrangle, the Radcliffe Institute, and, of course, Radcliffe crew, an organization that was rebirthed in 1971.
“When we first started, we were treated more like a house crew than a varsity sport, so we had to pick our boats after the [intramural teams] did,” Crane said. “The boats we were left with were probably twice as heavy as the average house boat and three times as heavy as the men’s team’s state-of-the-art boats.”
However, the women on the team weren’t concerned with the disparities between how they and the Harvard team were treated. Rather, they were much more focused on the actual sport.
“[The Radcliffe team] became a very close-knit group,” said Debbie Weil ’74, who walked on to the team just as the merger between the two schools was beginning. “I don’t think we spent a lot of time thinking about the politics of it — you just showed up, worked hard, and got blisters all over your hands.”
That all changed in 1974. The merger agreement between Harvard and Radcliffe involved combining their athletic programs under the Crimson’s system. However, Harry Parker, the coach of the men’s crew team, “didn’t want anything to do with women,” as Weil put it. Thus, the women’s crew team became a part of Harvard College — under the same roof as, but separate from, the men’s team. This left the women in black with one question: would they take the Harvard name, or remain Radcliffe Crew?
“The question was… posed to all of the Radcliffe teams at the time, did they want to be Harvard women or Radcliffe?” said Peter Huntsman '74, Radcliffe’s lightweight crew coach from 1974 to 1979. “All the other teams voted Harvard; not the crew [team]. We stayed Radcliffe and maintained our team identity as the Black and White.”
At its core, the reasoning behind this decision involved the imbalance of resources afforded to the women’s team in comparison to those given to the men’s team. The women of Radcliffe did not take lightly to the Crimson’s lack of hospitality toward its newest program.
“We were more than a little annoyed that we didn’t have a shell, oars, uniforms, travel money, and weren’t allowed into Newell [Boathouse]… as the men were,” said Constance Cervilla ’74 of her team’s treatment by Harvard. “We decided that therefore we’d embrace being Radcliffe athletes.”
Harvard’s discrimination against the newest members of its college, however, was just as prevalent on campus as it was on the river. For the women from Radcliffe, obtaining a Harvard diploma was no piece of cake.
“I was expressly told by the chair of the math department that women didn’t major in math at Harvard,” Ruth Colker ’78 said. “In that atmosphere, I was proud to wear the Radcliffe name and had little interest in associating with Harvard.”
For the members of the Radcliffe crew team, the name “Radcliffe” embodied much more than just a college. To them, it was a symbol of having overcome adversity to become one of the most well-respected teams in women’s crew.
“The Radcliffe rowers… were justifiably proud of having, in three years, won a national championship and being given the honor of representing the US,” Huntsman said. “They very much wanted to maintain an identity distinct from the rowers at Newell. Within the community of women’s rowing programs in the 1970s, the name Radcliffe was special. It had, and it continues to have, a cachet that sets it apart from all of the various ‘women’s programs’ at other universities. You don’t need to attach ‘women’ to Radcliffe: it stands alone.”
The impact of the original Radcliffe rowers stretches beyond their simply being the first members of the women’s team. Rather, those currently on the women’s rowing team still recognize the lasting effects that their predecessors’ naming decision has had on Radcliffe crew.
“We’re the only original team that kept the Radcliffe name, which is pretty cool,” said Julia Davis ’19, a current senior on the team. “It’s basically a testament to our strong, womanly roots.”
Today, the Radcliffe name symbolizes the difficulties faced by the earliest pioneers of women’s crew in Cambridge.
“While Harvard Athletics today is absolutely wonderful to all athletes, men and women… [Harvard College] did not embrace women student athletes before Title IX,” Cervilla said. “We were proudly the Radcliffe crew — proud of what we were able to do with homemade uniforms and weights, borrowed equipment, and Alumnae funding. I think there was probably a pre-Title IX parenthetical message in ‘Radcliffe’ which was ‘not Harvard’. Today, that wouldn’t be necessary.”
As Radcliffe crew competes in the 54th Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend, they will row in their own state-of-the-art boats, launch from their own boathouse, and dress in their own, turtleneck-less uniforms, black-and-white emblems proudly displayed on each and every one. The banks of the Charles will be lined with students, male and female, cheering for the teams from Harvard College, an institution that will forever be crimson-stained by the struggles faced by those women in black.
While many collegiate sports at Harvard accept walk-ons, few are more walk-on friendly than Harvard crew. Every fall, the program welcomes a new, wide-eyed class of freshman eager to make their mark on campus.
For current walk-ons, a shared desire to continue their athletic careers, be a part of a larger community, and exploring a new passion combine to form strong bonds among this group.
One of those first year walk-ons is current member of Harvard men’s heavyweight crew, Zach Keller.
“I had never rowed before, but they actually have a novice program [last] fall, where a coach teaches [prospective students] who want to join the team [how] to row,” said Keller when talking about his rowing experience.
Keller, a current sophomore from Summit, N.J., fondly remembers his journey as a walk-on. While attending The Pingry School, Keller played both basketball and baseball. He quickly realized that he did not want to pursue them on a club level at Harvard. Still wanting to compete athletically, Keller decided to set his sights on a new sport. Intrigued by the well-established walk-on process and recommendations from others, Keller ultimately decided to join the heavyweight team.
“I’m working a lot harder now, but that is the function of playing at a collegiate level,” the Summit, N.J., native said. “There is a much bigger fitness component in rowing.”
Senior Emily Moya, who joined the women’s lightweight crew as a walk-on sophomore year, echoed Keller’s sentiment about the increase in workload associated with being a varsity athlete for the Crimson.
“High school was definitely a lot lighter on the training side,” the senior said. “High school sports you train probably two hours a day, for five days a week. Transitioning into college athletics, it’s about three to four hours a day, six days a week.”
Moya attended Boston Latin School, where she was a cross country and track runner. In high school, athletics were a huge part of her identity and was a feeling she missed during her freshman year. Her desire to re-engage with sports lead her to join the women’s lightweight crew her sophomore year as a walk-on.
“Being an athlete here at Harvard, it definitely changes the way you are as a person,” Moya said. “It helps you become more organized and a big aspect of crew is it brings a lot of grit to the sport, as well as perseverance.It has transitioned into my academics, and that is where I have seen myself grow a lot.”
While some walk-ons have no prior rowing experience, that is not the case for sophomore Andrew Haimovici. A member of the men’s heavyweight crew, Andrew had previous rowing experience in high school and enjoyed crew.
“I already did it in high school, so I might as well give it a go here,” Haimovici said. “It is a legendary team with all the history — I thought it would be cool to join.”
The day before move-in day, Haimovici emailed the coach inquiring about joining the team. After some back and forth with the coach, including a primary assessment of his abilities, he was invited to the team practice. During his freshman and sophomore years of high school, Haimovici did not enjoy rowing that much, citing the intensity involved in rowing and the time commitment required. But as Haimovici’s skills started to develop and his ability to compete increased, his enjoyment of rowing grew.
“I live with rowers,” Haimovici said. “I eat almost every meal with rowers. If I go out on the weekends, I’m going to go out with rowers. It’s not one of those teams that you just show up at the boathouse and that’s over with.”
The strong presence of community that Haimovici talks about can be felt as soon as you join the team, as is the case for freshmen and Pennypacker resident Noor Kamal.
Coming to Harvard, Kamal wanted to try something new and step outside her comfort zone. The Long Island, N.Y., native was introduced to coxswaining by her friend who had been a steerer for the Crimson and another person from her high school had also coxed. Kamal credits her teammates and coaches for the wonderful advice she has received as she navigates her first year at Harvard.
“It’s awesome...the guys, it truly is beautiful to see the sense of camaraderie they have for each other,” Noor said. “Getting the boats out the dock...they’re all having such a blast.”
A very important part of the Harvard crew experience is the sense of community. This camaraderie creates an atmosphere of support and not only allows each individual person to grow but also lets the whole team grow as well.
An example of this very tight knit community is the training that occurs for the Harvard-Yale Regatta. To train for this race, the team goes to a special training facility called Red Top, located in Connecticut. This training facility exists for the sole purpose of training for this race. The rowers spend two entire weeks there, devoting their time extensively to prepare for the race.
“You literally do everything with the guys on the team,” Keller said. “You bunk together. You eat and train together. It was awesome. It felt like I really got to know the guys a lot better and develop really close bonds with them.”

The cool air briskly brushes the rowers’ faces. The frigid river water splashes onto the coxswain. Thousands of people fill the banks of the Charles River as they attentively watch the rowers swift by. Along with The Game between Harvard and Yale, the Head of the Charles Regatta is one of the top annual sporting events on Harvard’s campus.
Dating back to 1965, The Head of the Charles (HOCR) was the creation of Cambridge Boat Club members D'Arcy MacMahon, Howard McIntyre, and Jack Vincent. As a way to build enthusiasm for rowers from long hours of training, MacMahon and his squad thought a regatta would be a fun way to entertain the athletes. While the club members had low expectations for spectator turnout, it was not until they received advice from famed Harvard sculling instructor, Ernest Arlett, that they gained the confidence to implement the event.
Although the Cambridge Boat Club members had their doubts, they were confident that the event would be a triumph for Cambridge. In fact, in an interview with New York Times, MacMahon and Olrich knew the event was “destined to become a classic.”
Beginning in 1997, the event began to span two days and has since been held on a weekend in October.
The 4,800-meter race starts at Boston University DeWolfe Boathouse and ends at Christian Herter Park. The event includes singles, doubles, fours, and eights, and participants from all age groups compete at the event. The course is a head race with a rolling start, meaning crews not only face each other but also have to have the fastest time to come out on top in their respective race.
However, while the event will enter its 54th year, many in the rowing community find the event to be relatively young.
“Don’t get me wrong, it’s really cool — especially [with] Harvard right in the middle of it and being probably the biggest rowing event in the world — but 54 years doesn’t really count as historical in the world of rowing,” freshman rower Paddy Adams said. “It’s probably more special to be part of Harvard rowing, which is much older, but even then it’s all relative.”
A main reason the event continues to find such success is the amount of detailed preparation in the week leading up to the regatta. The Head of the Charles consists of a 15-member Board of Directors — six of the members are in charge of race management and supervising an 11-member race committee. The committee meets all year, discussing procedural details and logistics for the upcoming event. In addition to the race committee, there are 115 volunteers from 30 distinct committees that meet weekly during the fall. A total of 1,700 devoted volunteers also help the event continue be a highlight for the community. There is also a full-time professional staff of four, headquartered in the Cambridge Boat Club, that works year-round to plan for the weekend by collecting sponsorships and interacting with rowing members in the community.
In 1991, Frederick V. Schoch was appointed Executive Director of the Regatta and continues to lead the event to this day. Schoch coached multiple years at Princeton, the U.S. Naval Academy, and Georgetown. Schoch also founded another Regatta in New York, called the Hudson Regatta, and has also been an active member of the US Rowing National Team Coaching Staff. In addition to serving as the director of HOCR, Schoch also serves on the National Rowing Foundation Board of Directors.
The event continues to surge in popularity with more than 11,000 athletes all over the world competing in 55 different race events and an expected attraction of hundreds of thousands of visitors. The event has also generated an abundance for its official charities, including Cambridge Community Foundation and Community Rowing. The Head of the Charles Regatta Charity Program allows competitors to gain entry into competition for donating $1,500 for singles, $2,500 for doubles, $3,000 for fours, and $5,000 for eights.
The Crimson’s crew teams have been especially excited for this year’s event, as they look to take the top seed in each event.
“Harvard is very excited about this year’s The Head of the Charles and have the same expectations as always,” said Ian Accomando, assistant coach of lightweight crew. “The team has been practicing diligently.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team added another weapon to its receiving corps this past weekend with Tyler Adams’ impressive performance against Holy Cross, part of a game in which the Crimson emerged victorious with a last-second field goal. Adams, a sophomore wide receiver from Louisville, Ohio, saw very little in-game action prior to last weekend’s contest. Only having one career reception prior to facing the Crusaders (1-6, 0-2 Patriot) — a catch for seven yards against San Diego this year — Adams was looking for a chance to showcase his abilities. With the absence of senior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, he seized that opportunity.
Adams’ career night began in the second quarter when he caught a 31-yard pass from senior quarterback Tom Stewart. He would go on to finish the half with another catch for ten yards along with a 19-yard run.
However, Adams’s second half performance was what cemented the fate of the game. Harvard’s sole touchdown in the third quarter came from a 28-yard snag by Adams, driving the lead up to 16 going into the fourth.
Holy Cross’ massive comeback in the final quarter of the game put the Crimson (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) in its first deficit all night. Harvard, facing a fourth down in the final drive of the game, desperately needed someone to make a play. With the game on the line, Stewart decided to place his trust in Adams once again. And following the theme of the night, Adams made the catch, moving the chains and keeping the game alive.
But perhaps the biggest play of the game came after the fourth down conversion. Adams’ biggest catch of the night came a play later, as he snagged a 30-yard pass while facing double coverage, drawing a flag for pass interference in the process. The catch set the team in prime field goal position with seconds to go in the game. A play and a couple of timeouts later, junior kicker Jake McIntyre sealed the deal with a 25-yard field goal.
Adams finished the game with seven reception for 84 yards, a receiving touchdown, and 33 rushing yards. His performance on Friday was pivotal in the Crimson’s victory. With a win over the Crusaders, Harvard was able to put an end to its two-game losing streak. The Crimson is hosting Princeton this Saturday at noon, looking to start a winning streak of its own going into the second half of the season. After seizing his chance last week, Adams looks to play a bigger role among a talented group of receivers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Princeton is averaging 52 points per game. Its opponents are averaging 8.6. The latter number has produced a season in which the Tigers have yet to allow an opposing team notch more than 10 points — a feat that was last achieved in 1935 when the captain of that team was nominated for the Heisman trophy. The last time a Princeton team scored 260 points in its first five contests was in 1888.
On Saturday, Harvard (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) will meet this historically hot No. 18/23 Princeton (5-0, 2-0) team for the 111th rendition of the matchup on the turf of Harvard Stadium at noon.
“[This is] probably the best Princeton team, conservatively, in the last 40 years,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re always excited to play. We’re always particularly excited to play big games like Princeton, but this will be a tremendous challenge because they appear to have no weaknesses.”
This is the second consecutive season that Harvard will host Princeton at its coliseum. The duplicity is a result of the Ivy League shifting its schedule this season and is the first time since a series of Harvard home games beginning in 1973 that the two teams have squared off at Harvard Stadium twice in a row.
Last season, the home field advantage didn’t do much good as Princeton obliterated Harvard in its own house, 52-17 — the worst home loss for Harvard in over 50 years. Speaking of second times, Harvard has already squared off against one ranked team this season: No. 20/22 Rhode Island. The 23-16 loss to the Rams was the team’s first of the season.
Princeton, however, hasn’t lost — a feat only four other FCS teams have managed to replicate. Those three other teams are No. 1/1 North Dakota State, No. 13/17 Colgate and No. 24 Dartmouth. This is the first time since 2006 that Princeton has tallied wins in each of its first five games.
That domination comes in part from the return of quarterback John Lovett. The 2016 Ivy League Player of the Year missed last season due to a shoulder injury but now sits atop multiple FCS lists. He leads the nation in rush yards per carry (8.98) and in points responsible per game (27.5), and he is second in passing efficiency (187.5). He likewise is top three in the Ancient Eight for rushing yards and passing yards per game with 101 and 233, respectively. Lovett is the only Ivy League player to rank top 10 in both.
“He’s kind of a perfect storm of that big type of wildcat quarterback … and at the same time he’s certainly skilled enough to get the ball down the field,” Murphy said. “The combination has been pretty unique.”
Against Lehigh on Oct. 6, Lovett suffered an injury. The starter was sidelined for the following Brown matchup but the team’s offensive production did not stutter. Instead, junior Kevin Davidson made his first collegiate start, throwing for 304 yards and adding four touchdowns for the cherry on top.
Lovett is currently being evaluated as day-to-day and there’s no word yet whether the senior will lead Princeton in Saturday’s contest.
Harvard is facing injuries of its own. Against Cornell, senior wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley was enveloped by a squad of defenders on a punt return. The standout senior will not return to play this season.
Supplementing Princeton’s quarterback, whoever that may be, is senior wide receiver Jesper Horsted. He is Princeton’s all-time leader in touchdown catches with 23, third in the institution’s history for career receptions with 159, and fourth in career receiving yards with 2,192.
Horsted’s best game, however, was last season’s trouncing of Harvard in which the then-junior notched personal bests in receptions and yards.
For Harvard, it has been the field goal unit that has been the most pristine thus far. Junior kicker Jake McIntyre is only three boots away from tying the program record of 30 in a career. The junior currently ranks second in the nation for field goals per game with two. McIntyre tallied the final points for Harvard last week in a walk-off field goal against Holy Cross.
The team’s defense has also been consistently solid. The squad is third in the nation for first down defense and fourth-down conversion defense. Princeton, conversely, has converted a perfect four for four on fourth downs during the last two games.
Under center for Harvard will be senior Tom Stewart. Saturday’s game will represent the senior’s third start for team, after taking first snaps last week against Holy Cross.
“[Tom Stewart has] been giving us an dynamic presence, offensive and in general,” Murphy said. “His ability to get the ball down the field accurately has really opened up a new dimension for our offense because we have some kids who can run.”
While it’s Stewart’s third career start, he’s been throwing with some of his receivers for almost five years. Namely senior Adam Scott.
“We’re both from Texas so we kind of have that Texas connection,” Scott said. “Prior to us coming here we would both train together. When we found out we were both committed here … he would drive up to my high school, like 45 minutes away, we would throw and just kind of visualize ourselves on the field and now it’s unfolding right now. It’s pretty cool.”
Harvard will need the connection to convert into points Saturday as so far this season, Princeton hasn’t lost a single quarter.
“I think we keep it a close game and keep in it into the fourth,” McIntyre said. “They haven’t had to play a full game yet so I think we can tire them out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Both coming off of commanding 8-0 victories over Cornell and Brown, respectively, Ivy powerhouses No. 9 Harvard and No. 3 Princeton will meet up once again at the Tiger’s Bedford Field for the de facto Ivy League championship game.
“This game is a top 10 matchup which is always great to have,” said head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “I think the Harvard-Princeton game over the last couple of years has really set itself apart by being the game that decides the Ivy League championship. I still consider us the underdogs in how we approach the game. The stage is set and there will be a lot of people out there and we know that.”
After earning its school-record ninth consecutive victory, the Crimson (12-1, 4-0 Ivy League) achieved its highest national ranking ever at No. 9 in the latest Penn Monto/NFHCA Division I National Coaches Poll. The team boasts both a strong offense and a steel-walled defense, currently standing at sixth in the nation in scoring offense at a 3.62 goals per game and an impressive second in goals against average at 0.77.
Juniors Bente van Vlijmen (10 goals, five assists) and Maddie Earle (12 goals, two assists) spearhead Harvard’s offense, with Earle leading the Ivy League in scoring with 26 points — on pace to threaten the single season program scoring record of 42 points held by Judy Collins '99 and Shelley Maasdorp '05.
Meanwhile, the Tigers (11-3, 4-0) boast a resume of similar caliber, with its defense at 1.12 goals against average and its offense at 3.5 goals per game. Coming into Saturday’s match, Princeton is 40-6-2 all time against the Crimson, winning 23 of the last 24 meetings with Harvard’s only win in 2016. Despite the unfavorable historical standing, coach van Herwaarden remained highly optimistic of his team’s odds this season.
“We’ve been consistent for the past three to four years, and we’ve been able to turn the program around and set ourselves up to win the Ivy League championship on a yearly basis,” van Herwaarden stated.
Hoping to continue with its success, the team seeks to capitalize on its superb defense that has produced seven shutout victories so far. The Crimson’s back line will be threatened by sophomore Julianna Tornetta, who scored 3 goals against the Bears. Other weapons for the Tigers include freshman Hannah Davey who ranks 20th in the nation in assists per contest and sophomore MaryKate Neff who leads the league in defensive saves.
With four more games in the regular season, three of which are crucial Ancient Eight matchups, there’s still much to do for the field hockey team especially as they fight their way to the championship.
“I think we’re in a great boat,” van Herwaarden said. “There’s been a growth that’s been much seen on a week to week basis. Although our record, with nine straight wins is fantastic and our rank, at number nine, is fantastic, we haven’t seen our best effort yet. Our team knows it. There’s still a whole new level to us so it’s exciting just to keep growing and keep that mindset. We are putting ourselves in the best position possible to win the Ivy League championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The energy will be palpable on Friday night in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center as the women’s ice hockey season gets underway. Harvard and Dartmouth are set to hit the ice for their first meaningful game after both took on McGill in a preseason exhibition. The Crimson defeated the Martlets 4-0 at home last Friday, but the Big Green fell 2-1 this past Sunday. The two sides will be looking to start the year off with some momentum and steal points away from their fellow Ivy League competitor.
“It’s the opening game for the season and it’s an opening Ivy game so I know all the returners know what’s at stake,” senior defender Kaitlin Tse said. “The freshman, as they usually do, [know to] just keep your head down and work hard, take what you’re given, and own your goal.”
Harvard will look to continue the upward trend that it’s been on since the end of last season. After a lackluster 2016-2017 campaign left them at 5-19-5, the Crimson rebounded to finish 13-16-2 in 2017-2018. This effort was good enough to land Coach Katey Stone’s squad a spot in the postseason, where it fell to Colgate in the ECAC tournament quarterfinals.
“I think last year was an unbelievable season for us,” captain forward Kate Hallett said. “We put ourselves back out there as a leading team…I think we’re going to take that energy and transition that to this year, take everything we learned from that… but recognize that it’s a new roster, it’s a new team, it’s a new opportunity.”
This roster is definitely different than last year’s. Seven freshman have been added to the squad, and this group is headlined by goalie Lindsay Reed. In her preseason debut, the New Jersey native saved all 13 shots she faced in 20 minutes of action.
Another important boost to the team will be captain Lexie Laing. After being forced to sit out last year for health reasons, Laing is back and surely will be looking to make up for lost time. She has already made her presence known in the box score, netting two of Harvard’s four goals in the aforementioned exhibition against McGill.
“I think having her back, both as a senior, as a leader, as a captain, both on and off the ice, she’s going to be unbelievable,” Hallett said. “She’s really going to produce a lot for our team this year, so I think Lexie Laing is someone to keep a lookout for.”
The Crimson’s first test will be against a hungry Dartmouth team looking to improve off of last year’s disappointing season (5-19-3, 3-16-3 ECAC). Junior captain forward Christina Rombaut leads the group. Rombaut earned her position as captain by having the joint second-highest point total on the team last year at 12 (three goals and nine assists).
The Big Green heads into the contest with the added incentive of avenging its two losses against Harvard a year ago. In the 2017-2018 season opener, Dartmouth was thoroughly beaten by a score of 4-1 in Cambridge. The second matchup, taking place in Hanover, N.H., was much closer, with the Crimson grinding out a 1-0 win.
Come puck drop on Friday, both sides will be ready to kick things off. The intensity will be high, and all the student-athletes will be fighting for every inch of ice, playing as if everything is on the line.
However, it is important to realize that this game is merely a first step in a long journey. A win would be positive, but it is just one win. Likewise, a loss would be frustrating, but it is just one loss. Effort and focus will have to be maintained for a whole season in order for the team to find success and achieve its goals.
“One thing on which we focus is just taking it a practice, a lift, a game at a time, and not getting ahead of ourselves,” Hallett said. “Also, treating every game like a championship game, scratching and clawing to get every single point that we can, in hopes of positioning ourselves well for playoffs.”
In addition to consistent effort, a strong team culture and sense of unity will be important. Harvard will play plenty of top-notch, talented teams, but all the talent in the world can only take a group so far. It will be team hockey and trust in one another that puts the Crimson over the top and earns it its wins.
“There’s no hierarchy of voices and roles,” Tse said. “It’s like everyone’s in, and it’s really important because leadership really comes from the bottom and that’s what we’re trying to cultivate on our team right now. It doesn’t matter if there’s a ‘C’ on your jersey, or freshman, sophomore, playing time, no playing time.”
Despite the attitude of taking it one day at a time, it is impossible to avoid thinking about what could be. Harvard has high expectations for this season and believes it can make a deep run in the playoffs. There will be plenty of ups and downs throughout the year, but the Crimson’s postseason hopes will hinge on how it grows, develops, and adjusts during the season. That being said, it all begins against the Big Green on Friday night.
“Our main goal is always a national championship,” junior forward Kat Hughes said. “I think this group is extremely talented but also extremely close knit, and it seems like a really good recipe for success.”
