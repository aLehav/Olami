After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last August, two Harvard University Police Department officers responded to a report that an unidentified individual at the Barker Center was cutting a bicycle lock. They encountered a young man cutting the lock off a bike he claimed belonged to him. The bike was his, but it was reported that one of the officers drew a pistol and pointed it at the young man. President Faust introduced a committee to investigate how the HUPD can serve the Harvard campus in response to this event, allegations of inappropriate practices, and out of a desire to ensure the security of our campus. 
The committee concluded that the HUPD usually satisfies expectations and that environmental factors often lead to non-ideal encounters. Assuming that security is the community’s responsibility, the committee made a series of recommendations intended to immerse the HUPD in the community as well as a recommendation to institutionalize a process through which individuals could lodge a complaint against the department and have it investigated and resolved. 
The HUPD faces a number of unique policing challenges—the most significant being that there are frequent visitors to the Harvard campus who may be less committed to its security and well-being. Consider that, last year, 86 percent of arrests and complaints were lodged against non-Harvard affiliates. Our campus resides in the center of an urban environment, and a malicious individual could easily access the campus, commit a crime, and leave. Furthermore, the HUPD cannot examine the legitimacy of each call before responding, as this could dangerously delay an HUPD presence at the most crucial moment of a crisis. Thus, HUPD officers may at times become unknowing vehicles for the prejudices of individuals calling in a “crime.” Also, the Harvard police are subject to stricter public scrutiny than most departments, as incidents—often overlooked elsewhere—tend to receive tremendous attention at Harvard. 
To immerse the HUPD more broadly into campus life creates opportunities for non-enforcement interactions between the HUPD and students. For example, an “account management system” would allow the HUPD to enlist individual officers in outreach efforts. Each officer would be assigned to manage a few accounts, and various student groups, Houses, administrators, and faculty members would be represented in a uniquely managed account. In order to be successful, these accounts must fulfill their reciprocal responsibility to join in the HUPD officers’ efforts. By conducting a safety seminar, attending a student group meeting, or even playing in an intramural game, officers could make account deposits and eventually quantitatively track their community involvement.
Next school year, we envision a closer relationship between the community and the HUPD. On move-in day, officers meet students and parents in the houses and distribute newly written literature on the HUPD, discussing our collective responsibility to security. Many students already have strong relationships with House security guards, and we hope these relationships can serve as a model for other students’ relationships with HUPD officers. For example, many students in Mather House know the house guard, Arun Malik. They talk to him about their theses or the science-fiction book he is authoring. Malik is considerably connected to our House and our students. Thus, we advocate that the HUPD form closer relationships with individuals like Malik, in addition to other stakeholders in the Houses, such as the masters, diversity tutors, and House Committees. A one-sided relationship is impossible, and community members must make reciprocal efforts to build relationships by engaging HUPD officers in conversations or by sharing a meal with an officer. Through these types of partnerships, our community will be better positioned to protect our collective security. 
Maintaining a safe campus requires collective participation. For example, we expect that anyone intending to host an event involving significant numbers of visitors should communicate with the HUPD. All Harvard affiliates should present Harvard identification when asked for it. We also recommend that the university establish a public safety committee to review policies and survey data to be conducted by the HUPD and to create more modes of community involvement.
Of course, these and other measures will not solve every problem. Knowing this, the committee suggests a new method for resolving complaints of misconduct. A system for resolving disputes should be institutionalized, as it would be beneficial for everyone if fair and transparent response mechanisms regularly resolved conflicts. The HUPD could be certain they were using the best possible practices and the community could see to it that complaints were properly resolved. So, the committee recommends that the first response to a complaint from a Harvard affiliate be an internal departmental investigation. Such investigations should be systematically conducted in response to credible complaints sent to an e-mail address created for this purpose. If the individual lodging the complaint is dissatisfied with the investigation, the university ombudsman—who does not currently investigate such matters—ought to be empowered in appropriate cases to conduct their own analysis and resolve the matter.
We hope these and our other recommendations will help the HUPD to build upon their already commendable work and to engage the community in the shared responsibility of ensuring campus security.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The liberal-arts education has taken on a queer form indeed at Harvard College. A student may arrive here from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Va.—among the best secondary schools in the nation—ready to study mathematics. He ambitiously prepares a plan of study that allows him to earn an honors degree, a foreign language citation, and a Phi Beta Kappa key, all before his 22nd birthday. 
While taking rather seriously the selection of his departmental courses and high-powered economics and statistics electives—the recruiters at D. E. Shaw & Co. are to be duly impressed—our young hero applies an entirely different set of criteria when it comes to fulfilling his General Education (The Curriculum Formerly Known as Core) requirements. Rather than “What will I learn?,” he asks himself, “When will I wake up to go to class?” After then cross-referencing those options with his now-only-digital Q Guide, with an eye toward maximizing his grade point average, he settles on Japan Pop: From Basho to Banana as his first step toward the laudable goal of a liberal education. Over the next four years, he will also sign up for The World in 1776, The Images of Alexander the Great, Revolution and Reaction: The Rise and Fall of the Russian Avant-Garde, Confucian Humanism: Self-Cultivation and Moral Community, and Dinosaurs and Their Relatives. These courses, claim the venerable Harvard College administrators, will liberalize an otherwise parochial course load.
This regime of miscellany—motley enough to impress Ben Schott—will, according to the College, “connect [the student’s] liberal education—that is, an education conducted in a spirit of free inquiry, rewarding in its own right—to life beyond college.” The hapless freshman, who trusted the so very many rankings and social signals that assured him there was no place like Harvard for a liberal education, has been badly shortchanged. While he will have spent $3,000 on books for his classes, he will not have bought a single work of William Shakespeare or Henry James. He will be wholly unfamiliar with John Stuart Mill or Bertrand Russell. Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus might as well be Plato or Aristotle—that is to say, Greek. This newspaper reported last Thursday that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris informed an ad hoc committee deliberating the addition of a Great Books element to the new Program for General Education that the plan was on hold due to the financial crisis.
Deeply troubling and extremely questionable, this recent development suggests that the administration is not at all serious about rethinking what ought to constitute a liberal education. The Program for General Education, finalized nearly two years ago, is a comically slight permutation of the Core Curriculum: Quantitative Reasoning becomes Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, Moral Reasoning becomes Ethical Reasoning, Foreign Cultures becomes Societies of the World, and so on. It is insulting that ostensibly the most intellectually rigorous body in academia (the Faculty of Arts and Sciences) thought the Harvard community—so well trained by the old Core in “ways of knowing”—could be so easily hoodwinked. The college squandered its one chance in a generation to modernize Harvard’s undergraduate education.
Gen Ed’s only hope for salvation lies in rationalizing the concept of required courses or fields of study by admitting that there exists a canon and that it is worth knowing. The administration’s decision to frustrate efforts to incorporate Great Books into the undergraduate curriculum suggests that the school has decided against changing the Core in any meaningful way. Dispirited, the ad hoc committee that was considering the issue, led by forward-thinking Professors David Armitage and Marjorie Garber, will no longer even meet. By framing the debate around Gen Ed in fundamentally semantic terms (look above at the main fruits of a ponderously lengthy curricular review!), the faculty has forfeited the right to be taken seriously as teachers. Considering the quantum of scholarship devoted to debating what is and is not canonical, it is shocking that these selfsame scholars refuse to arm all young undergraduates with knowledge this canon.
Nick Carraway explains in The Great Gatsby—which I read because my high school and the writers of the Advanced Placement English Literature and Composition test luckily did believe in Great Books—that he is going to take up a heavy reading schedule so that he can become “that most limited of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’” It is embarrassing that Harvard believes a medley of irrelevancies will prepare students for “life beyond college,” and even more embarrassing that the financial crisis is used as an excuse to stop investigating the serious idea that Great Books have a place in undergraduate education. Nothing less than the future of Harvard’s status as the premier provider of a liberal education is at stake, and this writer, on the occasion of his last column of the year, hopes that the administration will undo its decision with haste.

News that the administration is considering offering professors an early retirement incentive is worrying, especially in conjunction with the ongoing hiring freeze FAS implemented last November. The faculty buyout has the potential to harm Harvard’s educational mission if it is carried out with the hiring freeze still in place. The early retirement incentive is similar to one offered to staff two months ago and is part of a series of measures intended to pare down the faculty’s budget, which is expected to run a $220 million deficit over the next two years if the school does not take measures to reduce its expenditures.
While cost-cutting measures are certainly necessary given the FAS financial situation, trimming the faculty to decrease costs harms a central mission of the University to maintain the highest standard of education possible. Measures that directly threaten Harvard’s quality of education should be a true last resort.
The early retirement incentive does make it easier for professors who wish to retire to do so and allows younger professors to rise in their fields. In fact, in many ways this is a better cost-cutting method than the hiring freeze, which prevents any new talent from being hired. If FAS is faced with the choice between a buyout and a hiring freeze, the buyout is the clear best choice.
Yet, when the buyout is coupled with the hiring freeze, it suggests that the faculty intends to decrease the total number of professors it employs, which could seriously harm the diversity and breadth of course offerings and fields of study—a diversity that is central to Harvard’s educational strength. As a cost-cutting measure, the buyout has the potential to damage the depth, reputation, and integrity of the school by effectively eliminating positions and, possibly, entire fields.
Some professors are the only specialists in their field at the University, and, if they leave while the hiring freeze is still in place, there may be no one to replace them until the freeze is lifted, during which time undergraduate and graduate students would be unable to study under an expert in that field. For this reason, faculty should consider carefully the impact that their departure may have on the study of their field at Harvard under the current hiring freeze before taking a buyout.
With the potential to harm Harvard’s academic mission, FAS should not implement this buyout, and if they find it necessary to do so, the hiring freeze should first be lifted. We appreciate the need for cost-cutting measures in these difficult economic times, but the University’s mission is to provide education of the highest caliber. Intentionally decreasing the size of the faculty is inconsistent with that mission and should only be seen as a last resort.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly every student wishes there were more hours in the day. In lieu of that, many Harvard undergrads have found a way to be more productive with the 24 hours they have: As a recent piece in the New Yorker reports, the use of “neuroenhancing” study drugs such as Adderall and Ritalin at places like Harvard is pervasive.  Though the New Yorker piece is largely anecdotal and does not necessarily indicate a meaningful rise in the use of study drugs at Harvard, it calls attention to the greater implications of the use of such drugs. We disapprove of the use of study drugs without prescriptions and also find fault with the cultural pressure students at Harvard feel that leads them to push their bodies and minds beyond their natural capacities.
One reason to condemn the use of neuroenhancing drugs is the simple illegality that is often attendant to their use. Students who obtain a prescription from a doctor for a legitimate reason should be allowed to use Adderall and Ritalin. There are certainly some students who have extreme trouble focusing and have a medical reason to use these drugs. The way that many students obtain study drugs, however, is by buying them from students with prescriptions. We disapprove of students who obtain—and use—such drugs illicitly, just as we criticize of any other misuse of prescription substances. Prescribed drugs are not a commodity to be shared; they are intended for the patient’s use alone. 
Improper use of such study drugs not only is illegal but also creates inequalities among students. Harvard does its best to make sure financial situations do not impact a student’s ability to excel at Harvard, but students who are more socioeconomically prosperous are the ones who are able to illegally buy study drugs from others. When these students are able to pay high prices for drugs through the black market, they receive an unfair academic advantage. 
It is also worth questioning the reason why so many students feel compelled to use neuroenhancing drugs. At Harvard, there is pressure to take a rigorous courseload whose time constraints are then compounded by extracurricular activities, jobs, social obligations, and more. That so many students at Harvard—and at other universities—feel the need to use study drugs to help fit everything into their day is quite telling. Perhaps students should not take on so many obligations if doing so means that they must supplement their natural abilities with drugs. 
Unfortunately, as long as people are prescribed study drugs, there will always be a black market among students. Even more important than stopping the illegal drug selling, however, is addressing the underlying reason why so many students feel the need to use illicit substances to expand their mental and physical capacities. Students should realize that they won’t need to swallow pills if they stop trying to accomplish more than is within their natural abilities.

Haven’t we heard this one before? Last week, Iran’s controversial president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, made a speech in which he said nasty, provocative things about Israel, leading to international uproar. Controversy is nothing new for Ahmadinejad, whose previous remarks—including “The American empire in the world is reaching the end” and “Israel is about to crash. This is God’s promise and the wish of all the world’s nations”—are notorious.
This time, though, the Western world took a bait it had set for itself. Ahmadinejad’s assertions that Israel is a “cruel and repressive racist regime” were made at a United Nations conference on racism in Geneva that the United States, along with the Netherlands, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Italy, had already decided to boycott over concerns that Ahmadinejad would abuse it in precisely this manner. That political leaders and journalists are now focusing nonstop on the inflammatory remarks indicates that Western countries’ decision not to attend may have had precisely the opposite effect of what they intended, drawing even greater attention to what Ahmadinejad said in their absence.
Certainly, President Obama and his administration are justified in their concerns over anti-Semitism and efforts to single Israel out for its actions. But, if the U.S. boycott was supposed to function as a protest, it was a misguided one. It did not prevent Ahmadinejad from making his speech and sending his message to the world; with those nations who did stay presumably supportive or neutral toward Ahmedinejad, the applause drawn by the Iranian leader seemed all the louder, coming as it did from these remaining delegations. What it did do instead was to allow the controversy surrounding his disparagement of Israel to overshadow efforts to address other pressing topics like slavery, genocide, and xenophobia.
This is not the first time the United States has boycotted a conference. We seem to have a history of ridiculous attempts to exert influence by not being present, as in our refusal to join the League of Nations and our boycott of the 1980 Olympic games in Moscow. And, in 2001, the U.S. and Israel walked out on the first conference on racism in Durban, South Africa, because certain parts of its final resolution explicitly alluded to Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as being driven by racism. Though these references were actually removed from later drafts of the Geneva declaration, the U.S. cited concerns over Ahmadinejad as reason enough to stay away from the conference. 
But boycotts rarely address root political problem and often actually aggravate a situation by drawing attention to what is being reacted against. Ignoring and avoiding Ahmadinejad will never make him go away or blunt his rhetoric. Instead of boycotting, the U.S. and other Western nations should have attended the conference and expressed their own thoughts on problems of racism and ways of combating them.
The very concept of the UN is predicated on the notion that as many nations as possible will participate and support it. By choosing to be absent from the conference, the U.S. forfeited the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to an international effort to deal with a very serious issue that many countries must address. Instead, the conference was dominated by a man who is clearly the very opposite of tolerance and open-mindedness.

As men, we speak up for a great many causes. We speak up to cheer on our favorite sports teams. We speak up to support our political candidates. We speak up to pray. We speak up to debate our opinions.
It’s time to speak up for something very important, and often overlooked. It’s time to speak up against sexism. It’s time to speak up against friends who harass and objectify women and think nothing of it. It’s time to champion gender equality and sexual respect.
Sexual violence and gender inequality are real. According to most estimates, between one-third and one-fifth of women will experience sexual or domestic violence at the hands of a male friend, partner, spouse, or date during their lifetime. The MenSpeakUp campaign believes that men must play a prominent part in addressing these problems if significant progress is to be made. A society of mutual respect requires men to rethink how they treat and interact with women.
The MenSpeakUp campaign is part startup, part social movement. Beginning right here at Harvard, we aim to continue the important work of women and men before us and join those who are currently working toward our goals. Through the creation of a team of dedicated men and an online website, we plan to make a meaningful and measurable impact across our campus and society. We are a new resource for men who strive to serve as positive examples of respectful manhood, who desire to take action against all forms of sexual violence and gender inequality.
The problems of sexual violence and gender inequality cannot be solved unless a higher bar is set for manhood. Many men already care about gender equality and nonviolence, but not enough of them speak up against joking references to rape or against other behavior that is demeaning to women. Too many men have stood by silently as a peer told a joke about domestic abuse; too many have failed to confront a friend known to sexually exploit women; too many have excused media that favorably depicts sexual violence as entertainment. 
MenSpeakUp will provide a support structure for courageous men to voice a new approach. We need men with willpower and fortitude to step outside the traditional thinking of these problems as “women’s issues” in order to help resolve them. We hope to catalyze the Harvard community toward much-needed change.
That change will not come easily. Reshaping social norms is difficult. It begins with the creation of a constructive atmosphere. MenSpeakUp plans to highlight the perspectives of men who will broadcast a positive and inclusive message to change men’s attitudes and actions. We want to tap into and amplify the Good in men and turn passive observers of injustice into active campaigners for equality and respect and to facilitate a comprehensive discussion.
MenSpeakUp’s website, menspeakup.org, launches today. The website and associated media will serve not only as the official student and alumni group website for MenSpeakUp, but also as a platform for Harvard’s public-service announcements, blogs from students and prominent supporters, and pledges of support from campus leaders. The goal is to stimulate constructive debate and deliver responsible and thoughtful content leadership on the Web—a space where such leadership is often wanting.
This website is the culmination of our efforts. We hope that it will fulfill its promise of providing an online platform for men who are concerned about the levels of gender inequality and violence in the world. We believe that these are the majority of men (despite what the media, tradition, or casual male demeanor might suggest). We very much encourage the participation of women on the website, as a dialogue between the sexes is of utmost importance in changing men’s perceptions of the problems at hand.
This site offers something different from many past men’s efforts, as it dares to feel at home on the Internet, an arena that is arguably hostile to the site’s mission. Many Web surfers know that they are always just a few clicks away from material that is misogynistic or treats violence against women casually.
We have the privilege, responsibility, and opportunity to work for gender equality. We shape the world we live in.

A search on amazon.com for “cougar” yields a helter-skelter selection ranging from innocuous merchandise—Washington State football gear, John Mellencamp albums, and a Disney-biopic-cum-Lassie-knockoff about a cub searching for his family—to unrated films and pornographic novels (Hot Cougar Sex and Cougars, Poptarts & One Night Stands, to name a few titles).  
Marketing firms are not the only ones who seem to have mistaken a wild stalk-and-ambush predator for an actual person. This image of an aggressively sexual older woman who pounces on younger men pervades our media. Spurred by the marriage of then-42-year-old Demi Moore to then-27-year-old heartthrob Ashton Kutcher, cougar mania swept Hollywood at the start of the millennium and engulfed both fictional characters (Samantha Jones, the seminal cougar of “Sex and the City” fame) and real-life women (most recently, Madonna, age 50, and her barely-legal Brazilian lover, Jesus Luz). Even Sarah Palin was deemed to possess cougar-worthy hotness, a status bolstered when doctored photos of her clad in a star-spangled bikini hit the web. “Cougar Town,” a sitcom starring Courtney Cox-Arquette as a divorcee on the prowl, is in the works at ABC, while “The Cougar,” a “Bachelorette” spin-off starring 20 20-somethings gaming for the affection of a 40-year old mother of four, airs weekly on TV Land. Sites like dateacougar.com offer a leopard-print infused twist on eHarmony; outside of the virtual world, cougar speed-dating presents further opportunities for felines to feast. 
At first glance, the term sounds like a progressive, coquettish take on the older-woman-beds-younger-man phenomenon. Its representation of females as both claiming and controlling their own sexuality explains why women have rushed to appropriate the epithet as empowering. Inverting the tradition of the sexless spinster, the moniker acknowledges that childbirth does not exorcise a woman’s libido and affirms the sex drive of the perimenopausal. 
In the pilot episode of “The Cougar,” cougar du jour Stacey Anderson nearly chokes herself with continual assertions of the term’s power to dispel cultural stereotypes and reverse traditional gender dynamics. Citing their heightened spontaneity and “zest for life” as the root of her attraction to younger men, Stacey suffuses her statements with not-so-subtle sexuality, gloating: “I’m in my prime, they’re in their prime, so not only is that connection outside the bedroom, it’s inside the bedroom as well!” Swap the genders and this assertion reeks of sexual exploitation. Yet, when applied to Stacey’s zesty boy-toys, who enter the scene in a party bus, pounding shots and concocting such precious one-liners as “I really hope this cougar likes lamb, ’cause I’m nice, sweet, and tender,” this terminology is acceptable.
In fact, there is nothing transgressive about Stacey’s typecast role. Morphing a welcome revelation of older women’s sexuality into the mindless caricature of a desperate youth-seeker who continues to have the hots after her hot flashes fade, the brand “cougar” is anything but forward-looking. The term was originally coined by men as a demeaning label for aging barflies who settled for whoever was still conscious at closing time. The “cougar” does not stem from a female fantasy of sexual empowerment, but from a male one: the desire to dominate and control the subversive sexuality of the woman past her prime. Bedding a woman in her 40s who knows what she wants and has a career to boot is the ultimate validation of a man’s stud-status. Like her counterpart, the MILF (Mother I’d Like to Fuck), the cougar’s brawn does not derive from an intrinsic feminine power: It hinges entirely on her desirability to men and the attractiveness of her mate.
The term “cougar” cannot even claim originality as its saving grace. Feline metaphors—fox, puma, pussy—have long been applied to female sexuality. “Cougar” is merely the latest epithet in a long tradition of verbal constructs—slut, skank, whore—that construe women as sub-human sexual objects. Urban Dictionary defines the cougar in terms of the sexual stimulation that she provides to men and her lack of emotional attachment: Cougars “don’t expect you to call the next day, and don’t require much cuddling after a good one night stand.” One particularly graphic entry describes the cougar as a miserly divorcee who was once the “town slut” and who now “enjoys going after men that are the age her aborted child would have been if it was still alive.” By these definitions, a cougar is not sexy and confident. She is a psychologically disturbed pervert and the laughing stock of her community.
That a woman who sleeps with a younger man needs to be called anything other than a woman is disturbing, not empowering. When older, unattractive men liaise with women half their age, we call them “sugar daddies” and “bachelors”; when older, attractive women do the same, we ridicule them and animalize their pursuits as if they were beyond the pale of civilized activity. By embracing this culturally imposed label, women like Stacey Anderson are not revolutionizing our modern understanding of female sexuality: They are merely aiding and abetting their own objectification.

Tory Row3 Brattle StreetCambridge, MA 02138(617) 876-8769No Reservations “Why are they called Tory Row if they’re not serving anything British?” asked one astute member of Jill Lepore’s seminar on the American Revolutionary War. Despite the witty name which referred to Brattle St. in the 1770s, the latest addition to the Square’s dining landscape, Tory Row, has little to do with anything British or frankly, revolutionary. This shout-out to the gastro-pub craze is the latest addition to Chris Lutes and Matthew Curtis’s restaurant mini-Empire. Tory Row is definitely reminiscent of the owners’ other well-trodden establishment, Cambridge 1, but the joint’s self-proclaimed “Euro-American food and traditional drink” means way more than pizza.  The increasingly fleshed-out menu is quite satisfying with a few highlights. They make a mean burger on ciabatta (avoid the potato roti on the side, which one diner dubbed a “weird rubbery situation.”) The duck confit salad strewn with shredded duck confit, plump dried cranberries, and pickled shallots, is delicious and a good deal as an entrée. Most things are shareable, including an array of grilled flatbreads and local littleneck clams, both done in the restaurant’s snazzy stainless-steel woodfire oven.   In true pub form, the bar is cocktail-free, but excellent draft and bottle beers, and well-priced European wines abound. The huge storefront windows onto the heart of the Square give the dimly-lit room an inside/outside feel (as if you’re actually part of some scene). While the grey slate tables and metal barstools work well with the overall minimalist aesthetic, comfortable is not the adjective that immediately comes to mind—the banquettes against one wall are so rigid they’d cure scoliosis. With a younger, self-consciously cool crowd and sleek, provocative décor, this bar-restaurant hybrid gestures strongly towards urban chic. “I don’t feel like I’m in the middle of Harvard Square,” described one diner, dreaming of life in the real world.

Some Harvard students studying in France may face the loss of a semester of education in the midst of a revolt that has gripped several of the nation’s universities since February. Schools in France have been forced to cancel classes and scramble for order while discontent with French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s handling of a bold higher education reform program has erupted into strikes and walkouts. For some of the 12 Harvard undergraduates who, according to the Office of International Programs, are currently studying in Paris, the situation has posed difficulties.  French professors have used classroom time not to lecture, but to inform students about the reasons why several university intellectuals have chosen to strike, said Lawrence Arbuthnott ’10 in an interview with The Crimson this weekend.“At the beginning of class, I would walk into my classes and was surprisingly greeted by a professor at the front of the room,” Arbuthnott said. “Once class started, however, the professor would sit down with the students and start informing the class about the strike,” he added.  Once universities began closing their doors in France, many students quickly grew nervous about jeopardizing their academic standing and took immediate steps to counteract this possibility, Arbuthnott said.  “At first, it was very disconcerting,” Sonia Coman ’11 wrote in an e-mail. “But gradually I succeeded in establishing contact with my professors, who kindly helped me to find solutions for each course affected by the strikes,”  Coman wrote. With more and more universities remaining closed for extended periods of time, Arbuthnott said he was forced to drop a class he initially signed up for and go elsewhere in order to fulfill his academic requirements. “In order to take four full courses and maintain my academic standing, I decided that it was in my best interest to drop some of my classes at public universities which were affected by the strike and instead take classes at private universities,” said Arbuthnott. Because the strikes have been centered on public universities, Crimson expatriates pursuing studies at private French universities have been entirely unaffected by the recent strikes. “The strikes have not had an impact on my classes, as I take all of my classes at Sciences Po, a private university,” wrote Annie Shoemaker ’10. “I have had a wonderful experience studying abroad and I hope that the strikes won’t deter future students from studying here,” she wrote.  Office of International Programs Director Catherine H. Winnie suggested in an e-mail yesterday that the value of the international experience in France may not be entirely compromised even for those Harvard students who are experience difficulties.  “I expect that our students will have some interesting tales to tell about studying in Paris, and have an enhanced understanding of French culture after these strikes,” Winnie wrote.

The new Harvard Club Soccer team took home the gold at Saturday’s “Kick Out Malaria Cup,” an event aimed at raising money for mosquito nets for villages in Sierra Leone.The event, organized by the team itself, is a sign of the increased freedom sports teams have as they transform from junior varsity to club-level organizations.Last year, Harvard’s JV Soccer Team, plagued with low participation rates and dwindling competition, disintegrated and the Harvard Club Soccer team emerged in its place. “It was really a shame because there are a lot of really good soccer players. There are a lot of guys who want to be out on the field and want to be a part of the team,” said last year’s club team co-president David B. Kopelman ’09 of the old JV program, “and we really did not think the JV program was fitting that bill.”According to Kopleman, by the end of the JV season, typically only four or five players would participate in the games.Organized as a club sport, the new team has more freedom than an official, athletic department-sponsored team, according to many of its members. “We play club because we want more playing time, but we also want to be engaged in the wider Harvard Community,” said club Soccer team co-president David M. Sengeh ’10. “We want to give back and be a part of community service.”The team organized “Kick out Malaria Cup,” sponsored by the Swiss Consulate of Boston and Global Minimum, an international student organization co-founded by Sengeh that operates a malaria project with Sierra Leone by distributing mosquito nets to households.“Once we had some guys on our team who wanted to go to Sierra Leone to work on the malaria eradication program, we thought why not tie those two together,” Sengeh said. “We have guys on the team who want to go out and help, but who also want to play football.  Why not have a tournament for that?”But without the athletic department’s administrative effort, the responsibility to organize the team is solely on the students.“It is a double-edged sword because we can do a lot more, but we have to do it all ourselves.” Kopelman said. “We schedule the games, we talk to the refs, we find opponents for ourselves, we played about three times as many games this year, but it was probably about ten times the work.”While the coordination and scheduling is demanding, co-president Jonathan C. Glapa ’11 said that at tryouts this past fall, around fifty students showed up, creating a highly competitive atmosphere that enabled Harvard Club Soccer to run two teams. From four players to fifty, the members of Harvard Club Soccer finished second in their NECCSL 2008 North Division and then won the sixteen-team Northeast Collegiate Club Soccer League.

High school seniors wielding red folders invaded the Yard this weekend for the College’s annual “April Visiting Program” for admitted students. With the Admissions Office working 24 hours a day to accommodate its slew of new visitors, the approximately 1100 “pre-frosh” in attendance had the opportunity to attend organized events ranging from academic and extracurricular orientations to various social receptions and parties.“There are like 1000 things to do,” said Gary D. Carlson, an incoming freshman from New Jersey. “It’s hard to decide what to do and so I have ended up doing nothing.”“It seems like there are a lot of opportunities here at Harvard,” said Ruoyu Zhang, another prefrosh, from San Jose. Billing itself as a “night of music, trivia, games, food, and a movie in Harvard’s very own movie theater,” one entertainment event—Saturday night’s “Pre-frosh Penthouse Party” at the Student Organization Center at Hilles—drew less-than-enthusiastic reviews from several attendees. “The penthouse started out as a reception, then it was a party, and then it turned into some sort of comedy thing,” said Brandon M. Law, a pre-frosh from Minnesota, “I was really confused, I thought I was in the wrong place.”But despite the confusion, many incoming freshman said they found the campus and its current inhabitants very welcoming.“It’s a pretty campus,” Zhang said. “The people are really friendly.” Newly admitted students and parents looking for more information on the college experience had the opportunity to attend a Sunday afternoon panel discussion about “What It’s like to be a Harvard Freshman.”The panel-discussion, anchored by two students along with Katie W. Steele, the Freshman Dean’s Office director for freshman programming, and Sandra Naddaff, the acting director of the freshman seminar program, addressed questions dealing with freshman-faculty interaction, community growth, and the typical life of a Harvard College freshman. “When I was pre-frosh, what blew me away about Harvard was that it seemed to me a like a community of intellectuals,” Ebrahim said during the event. “The teachers are passionate and the students are just as passionate.”“One of the things that I’ve gathered here is that it’s a place that kids can come not knowing what they want to be,” said Cesar Alcantar, whose daughter Casey was attending the visiting weekend. “This place fosters exploration for areas that will fuel their passion.”Several students interviewed by The Crimson over the course of the weekend said that they were surprised at how socially adept and diverse their peers seemed. “Coming to Harvard, I felt everyone would fit into particular stereotypes,” said Luke M. Giveen, a newly admitted student from Lebanon, N.H. “But everyone here is completely different from everyone and it is an unexpected but pleasant surprise.”

Students and religious leaders explored the intersection of religion and environmentalism at a conference held Friday at the Harvard Divinity School.At the gathering, “Ministry for Earth Community,” speakers presented various methods that religious leaders should use to encourage environmental activism. Many also emphasized that environmentalism has roots in the fundamental doctrines of many faiths.All four members of the panel discussion agreed that religious leaders are uniquely suited to inspire people to protect the environment. But they said that sparking such inspiration is an enormous challenge.“It is difficult to frame in terms of religious tradition or current mission,” said panelist Willis J. Jenkins, assistant professor of social ethics at Yale Divinity School. “Environmental issues have to make theological sense. They have to make a community come alive.”In that vein, each panelist discussed practical ways to describe environmentalism in terms of religious faith.“It can be a spiritual practice to turn off the light,” said panelist Reverend Margaret Bullitt-Jonas, an Episcopal priest and member of the leadership council for Religious Witness for the Earth, an interfaith organization dedicated to protecting the environment. “When we install solar panels we can worship God’s creation, the Appalachian mountains, which are being blown off in the search for coal,” she said.Roger S. Gottlieb, a panelist and professor of philosophy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, noted that “denial and avoidance are in a sense reasonable strategies when the reality is overwhelming.”“We need not just a short burst of energy during Earth Week, but an entire change of our way of living spiritually,” said Susan Abraham, moderator of the discussion and assistant professor of Women’s Studies and Ministry Studies at HDS.In the afternoon, audience members attended a series of workshops led by the panelists that aimed to develop skills in organizing and inspiring people to change. The workshops also emphasized humans’ interconnectedness with nature and faith.

Winthrop Park became even greener than usual on Friday as Harvard Square celebrated the first-ever “Great Big Green Party.” On Winthrop Street—adjacent to OM and Peet’s Coffee on JFK Street—swarms of party-goers celebrated Earth Week, picking up fliers, sampling food, and mingling with representatives from various local organizations. Square restaurants had booths set up, as did the Charles River Conservancy and Green Streets, a grassroots organization that promotes environmentally-friendly transportation. Visitors could also drop off unwanted computers, monitors, and cell phones for recycling at RE/MAX Destiny’s office around the street as part of the organization’s eco-wise realtor program.  Zipcar—the car-sharing service founded in Cambridge—was on-site as well, offering a discounted $25 annual membership. Visitors had the opportunity to write “environmental sins” on Zipcar’s black Honda Civic Hybrid Chura, confessing activities that were less than green.  “I drive to the store even though it is close enough for me to walk to,” read one confession. Boloco distributed biodegradable cups of compost made from the store’s organic waste filled with gardenia seeds. And as any party is incomplete without hors d’oeuvres, attendees were treated to food samples including chilled honeydew melon soup from Henrietta’s Table and chips, salsa, and guacamole from Chipotle. Nantucket Nectars—a beverage company based in Nantucket, Mass.—gave out samples of all-natural fruit juices. Wainwright Bank & Trust Company—a self-proclaimed socially-progressive bank with branches throughout Boston—was present to inform visitors about the bank’s green practices and to open new accounts. The Harvard Square branch on Brattle Street—which has bamboo flooring, low-flow faucets and toilets, and low-energy heating and cooling—is currently awaiting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. “It’s a great way to get people aware,” said Shoshi Stern-Robbins, a sixth grader at King Open School in East Cambridge. She said that she tries her best to be environmentally-friendly and pushed her school to stop using Styrofoam lunch trays. “It’s good to have a healthy environment and not have snow in April,” she said. At 1 p.m., a clean-up kicked off in Winthrop Park, with volunteers picking up trash, sweeping sidewalks, and raking grass. “It’s definitely a success,” said Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson as she took a break from raking the grass. “I could certainly see this becoming an annual event.” Aside from tourists, students, and Cambridge residents, the party also drew local luminaries. “It’s fantastic,” said City Councillor Sam Seidel, adding that he rides a bike whenever possible and is upgrading aspects of his house to improve energy-efficiency. “You can’t beat an event like this on a day like this,” he said.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Even Harvard’s most directionally-challenged may never get lost in the Square again.Harvard Student Agencies recently launcher Rover, a free iTunes application that provides users with the locations of hundreds of restaurants and stores in the Cambridge-Boston area.Rover also gives users live access to numerous deals and discounts in the Square exclusive to Rover users.The application, available for use on the newest versions of the Apple iPhone and iTouch, uses the Unofficial Guide to Student Life at Harvard, a guidebook published by HSA, as its main source of information.The book has reviews of over 900 establishments in Cambridge and Boston.“There are lots of good reviews, but would you ever bring a guidebook with you when you went out?” said Winston X. Yan ’10, co-creator of Rover.Rover uses GPS to pinpoint locations of interest according to the user’s specifications. It sorts all hits by distance from the user and displays relevant contact information for the selected establishment as well as maps of the surrounding area.Rover follows in the vein of similar iTunes applications at Duke and Stanford, but, according to co-creator Alexander G. Bick ’10, “Stanford and Duke have applications that are more focused on student academic life than student social life”—providing an interface to access grades, on-campus happenings, and other campus-based information. “From the outset we tried to take the great content that is in the Unofficial Guide and make it more easily usable, searchable, and accessible for students as opposed to focusing on student academic life,” Bick said.Bick and Yan came up with the idea for Rover one year ago while visiting London.“We were both doing research in Europe, and when we got together, we realized how useful it would be to have a guidebook on a cell phone instead of in paperback form,” Bick said.Bick and Yan, engineering and physics concentrators, respectively, used the programming knowledge they learned in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” to design the application.Rover won the Campus Services Ventures category of HSA’s I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge last year and was subsequently picked up to be a subdivision of the agency.The I3 Competition selects Harvard’s most innovative business ventures and inventions, created by undergraduates, and provides them with the monetary, technical, and legal support needed to get their ideas off the ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two years ago, writing scholar and long-time Director of Harvard’s expository writing program Nancy Sommers departed suddenly, leaving a program wrought with office politics and concerns about preceptor salaries and job security. In the wake of Sommers’ departure, long-time Writing Program employee Thomas R. Jehn was named interim director of the Harvard College Writing Program—which includes the Expos program, the Harvard Writing Project, and the Writing Center—in August 2007 in anticipation of what the administration said would be a nationwide search to find a new program director.The search, which was not advertised until November 2008, ultimately led to the recent announcement that Jehn would stay on as the Writing Program’s permanent director.Jehn’s selection has prompted both praise and criticism as those with knowledge of the program consider how his selection will affect the direction the program will take in the future.AN ADMINISTRATIVE FOCUSA graduate of the University of Chicago and the University of Virginia, Jehn first came to Harvard in 1997 as an Expos preceptor. Jehn has since climbed the Writing Program’s administrative ladder: serving as the head preceptor of Expos, the director of the Extension School’s Writing Center, and then the assistant director of the Harvard Writing Project.Yet despite his extensive teaching experience, Jehn differs from the program’s two most recent directors—Sommers and Richard Marius, both nationally renowned for their work in the field of writing composition—in that Jehn does not have as strong a record of published works.Jehn was one of four finalists for the director position, along with writing program directors from comparable institutions. Though the advertisement Harvard released for the job said that an applicant must be a “published author in a liberal arts discipline and/or on writing pedagogy in refereed journal,” one writing program director with knowledge of the search, who asked not to be named, said that Harvard administrators involved in the search did not ask applicants to provide information about their previously published works.In contrast to previous directors, Jehn’s strength has been administrative, rather than scholarly, which Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris lauded but writing program directors at colleges with programs similar to Harvard’s critiqued.“He’s not very well-known in the field,” said one writing program director, who asked not to be named. “He’s more of an administrator than an intellectual force in the field.”An Expos preceptor at the Extension School who asked not to be named said that having a well-known director in charge of a writing program is essential for attracting strong preceptors to the program.However, Harris said that the administration favored Jehn because of his previous experience with the program and vision for the future of the program.“It’s very nice if someone is well-known in New York or California, but what matters in this job is running a great program in Cambridge,” Harris said.A FORMALIZED VOICE? The Crimson spoke with multiple writing program directors who questioned how much pull a director without a professorship could have in working with other faculty members and administrators.Since its founding in 1872, the Harvard College Writing Program—the first program of its kind—has served as the model for writing instruction at a number of other schools, such as Princeton and Duke. While Harvard’s director has traditionally been a senior lecturer, many colleges with writing programs comparable to Harvard’s have placed a tenured professor at their program’s helm.Bruce Beiderwell, director of the UCLA Writing Programs, said that his lack of a professorship has made it more difficult for him to advocate for his program, which has become increasingly important as colleges begin to make financial cutbacks as a result of the economic crisis.“We have no formalized voice, so I often am in the position of trying to find someone to give me that voice,” Beiderwell said.Though two of the other finalists for the Harvard position are currently professors at other institutions, Harris said that the administration had discussed making the position a professorship at Harvard, but that it was “simply impossible.”“One cannot run a great writing program, which is a full-time job, and maintain a full research agenda, which is what gets one tenured at Harvard,” Harris said.PENDING PROBLEMSJehn takes the helm of a program that still faces many of the challenges expressed by preceptors over the past few years, including the long-standing issue of low preceptor salaries.“One complaint that is pretty genuine among preceptors is that preceptor salaries are too low,” said Expos preceptor Jason D’Cruz.The average preceptor makes less than $50,000 a year, D’Cruz said, which he said is challenging to live off of in an expensive area and is a low figure considering that most preceptors hold Ph.Ds.“Our preceptors definitely deserve better pay,” Jehn wrote in an e-mail. “I’m confident that [the administration] will continue to take seriously our program’s request for better preceptor pay that reflects our Expos faculty’s high qualifications, their importance to a core academic mission at Harvard, and their cost of living in one of the nation’s most expensive urban areas.”In the past, Jehn has been an outspoken critic of the administration for underpaying its employees. In 2001, Jehn—then an Expos head preceptor—published an op-ed in the Boston Globe strongly criticizing the Harvard administration for not implementing a living wage for its workers. Jehn published a similar article in The Christian Science Monitor, and the administration’s announcement of Jehn’s selection cites both as part of his published work.“I surmise that Harvard’s administrators likely spend much more time shaking the hands and sharing the confidences of the rich and powerful than they do finding out the names, fears, dreams, and wisdom of the janitors, cooks, and guards who, in that long-lived tradition of master-servant relations, labor invisibly each day,” Jehn wrote in the Globe article.Preceptors also continue to voice objection to the current system of one-year contracts—which preceptors have protested denies them job security—and a five-year limit on working in the position.“I know that there are lots of really competent preceptors going into their fourth and fifth years, and I know they are getting better and better,” D’Cruz said.Harvard Writing Project Assistant Director James Herron echoed this sentiment, adding that many times, the preceptors who have been teaching the longest are the ones who earn the highest Q ratings. “Expanding the term limits would enhance the stability of our program since our faculty could better focus on their teaching rather than have to become distracted with a job search just around the time when their teaching is attaining its most mature stage in our program,” Jehn wrote.  Harris said that the time cap on preceptor positions presents a difficult dilemma for administrators who are torn between holding on to strong preceptors and ensuring that preceptors make the most of their career options.“I’m concerned that we make it impossible for this to be a career path,” Harris said. “Teaching writing is a noble calling. At the same time, it is a serious moral challenge to have people in these not-tenurable positions where it is difficult to imagine someone being great at it for 40 years.” Harris said a committee is currently considering the time limit on preceptor positions and other non-tenure track positions at Harvard, which could potentially lead to changes to the hiring procedures.OPTIMISM FOR THE FUTUREDespite the challenges faced by the Expos program in recent years, many preceptors say that Jehn has led the program through the transition period with transparency and that they appreciate the base of knowledge of the program he has developed over time.“He has navigated the changes in the department incredibly well as interim director, and has proven to be an effective, enthusiastic, innovative and wonderfully supportive colleague and director,” preceptor Licia L. Carlson wrote in an e-mailed statement.While some have asserted that the Expos program has been isolated from departments in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, both Jehn and Harris have said that one of their major goals for the future of the Expos program is to make it so that students’ Expos experiences better prepare them for writing in their concentrations and other classes.Unlike undergraduates at colleges such as Duke, Stanford, and Yale, students at Harvard are not required to take a writing course specific to a discipline.Jehn wrote in an e-mail that he plans to work with departments to help preceptors learn more about what constitutes good writing in different disciplines. He also wrote that he plans to create a student advisory board comprised of undergraduates to advise preceptors and program administrators.“I’m interested in a collaborative process, in hearing compelling ideas from my colleagues in the program and in departments, from the deans, and from the students whom I’ve invited to join the Writing Program’s Student Advisory Board,” he wrote. “So in terms of when changes are implemented, I would hope to use the coming academic year to pilot some initiatives and then assess their efficacy before codifying anything.”Most preceptors The Crimson spoke to said they were hopeful that Jehn would be able to help the program overcome many of its long-standing struggles and expressed optimism about the future of the program.“I came into the department with some trepidation about the department not being respected or there being internal drama, but by the time I got there I didn’t find any,” said D’Cruz, who began teaching Expos this year. “No one feels like they are being shortchanged or hurt, and I think [Dr. Jehn] has been a really even-handed, fair-minded administrator.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

Elise X. Liu ’11, a Social Studies concentrator from Cabot House, was awarded the 111th Annual Jacob Wendell Scholarship Prize last night at the Harvard Faculty Club.The Wendell Prize, established in 1899, is awarded each year to a Harvard sophomore who exhibits extraordinary academic achievement and contributes to the Harvard community.About 40 guests, comprised of faculty members including Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, and several former Wendell Prize winners, attended the reception.The award requires an extensive application process.Students who obtain a GPA of at least 3.67 in their freshman year are typically invited to apply for the prize. To be considered, students must enter a written application, including an essay submission. The application also requires two recommendations from professors.Recipients of the award receive up to $5000 to be used for summer projects, renewed again after one year. The projects must be approved by the Wendell Prize selection committee to receive funding.According to Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor and a member Wendell selection committee, over 200 applications were received this year. After two cuts and an interview process, Liu was ultimately selected as the winner.“This is an incredible honor,” Liu said of her prize.For her application, Liu submitted an essay from her Expository Writing 20 class, which had been featured in this year’s Exposé. The essay, titled “The Infamous Hourglass: Constructing the Perfect Female Figure,” focused on the history of the corset.Liu’s family drove from Pittsburgh, Pa., to be with her as she received this honor.“I am very proud of Elise for winning this award,” Helen Wang, Elise’s mother, said. “I am pleased that she got the opportunity to work over the summer in a field she’s interested in,” she said.Liu will use the money from the award to work this summer at the Legal Resources Centre, a nongovernmental organization in South Africa.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stage was set. The Harvard softball team, a squad that had battled through offensive inconsistencies and a lack of pitching depth and experience, was just one win away from its third consecutive Ivy League North title. 
After sweeping Dartmouth in Hanover on Saturday with two late-inning rallies, it seemed the conclusion was inevitable.
All the Crimson needed was one win. One win at home, on a gorgeous summer-like afternoon, on Senior Day. 
What happened?
Harvard’s bats, which had produced 53 runs in the Crimson’s last seven games, were suddenly ice-cold. Freshman Rachel Brown had one off inning, but this time, there was nobody to pick her up.
That late-inning rally that had been Harvard’s calling card of late finally came in the de facto title game—but it came up short. 
And when all was said and done, it was the Big Green who celebrated its first Ivy North title on Soldiers Field late Sunday afternoon, while the Crimson could only sit and wonder what went wrong.
In the immediate aftermath, it’s hard to view the season as anything less than a disappointment. 
After returning eight of nine position starters from last year’s Ivy North championship team, and still carrying nine players who had won the Ancient Eight title in 2007, Harvard looked to be the odds-on favorite to get back to the ILCS and avenge last season’s sweep at the hands of Princeton.
Early on, it seemed that everything was falling into place for the Crimson. Most notably, Brown emerged as the dominant force on the mound that Harvard desperately needed—a role she filled throughout the season on her way to a 1.41 ERA and a single-season record 203 strikeouts. 
With a bona fide ace and an experienced offense intact, Harvard rolled through the preseason with its best record in years, picking up two tournament wins along the way.
Of course speed bumps would come–most notably the sudden departure of junior slugger and first baseman Lauren Murphy. But the Crimson absorbed the loss without skipping a beat, as rookie Whitney Shaw took over the starting role with ease. 
Shaw is now second on the team with a .303 batting average, leads the way with a .535 slugging percentage, and has made just five errors in 243 chances at first.
But the wheels started to come off at exactly the wrong time for Harvard. It was in the team’s opening Ivy games—a March 28 doubleheader at Columbia—that its offensive inconsistency reared its ugly head. 
The Crimson mustered just one run in the twinbill, and the nightcap’s 2-0 loss marked the first of four times in the 20-game Ivy season that Harvard would be shut out.
As the Ancient Eight slate wore on, the Crimson experienced the highest of highs—a 6-5 win over Cornell on April 4 to hand the Big Red its first Ivy loss, a dominant sweep of Brown last Sunday in which the offense put up 23 runs, taking two from the Big Green in Hanover to gain the division lead—and the lowest of lows. 
Two weeks ago Harvard was swept by Yale in a doubleheader that seemed to put the division title out of reach, and the team gave up seven runs with two outs in the bottom of the sixth against Brown to let the Bears blow open what had been a close game.
Lowest of them all, of course, was Sunday’s heartbreaking sweep.
What was most notable about the Dartmouth series is that the Crimson couldn’t stage a comeback. Against four of its seven Ivy opponents, Harvard rebounded from a loss to take the final game of the series. 
Excluding two back-to-back victories over Penn, the early-season loss to Columbia and Sunday’s sweep are the only two aberrations. 
The Crimson fought back from a deficit in its last three Ivy wins, and with the bats swinging the way they had been, it’s almost surprising that there were no late-inning heroics in Sunday’s twinbill.
Out of the disappointment, though, Harvard has something to look forward to. The Crimson graduates just two seniors this season, and though co-captains Hayley Bock and Bailey Vertovez have been vital to the team’s success, Harvard has junior Jess Pledger and freshman Jane Alexander waiting in the wings to step in and fill those spots.
Statistically, the team’s five best hitters and five best pitchers will return to Cambridge next season. An extra year of experience can only be beneficial for Brown and Shaw, and the Crimson’s strong junior class will provide a wealth of veteran leadership.
Harvard will have a chance to end the season on an up note Thursday with a road game at BU, but it seems that the bitter taste of Sunday’s losses will remain with the Crimson for a while. 
At least, that is, until Harvard gets its shot at the biggest comeback of all—to rebound from disappointment and reclaim the Ivy League title.

To his parents, he is Charles. To his teammates, he is Sir Chasington, or man-with-the-beard, or even simply beast. To the running world, though, Harvard junior Chas Gillespie is just fast. Last weekend, at the prestigious Penn Relays, Gillepsie proved just how fast he was, running his personal best in the 5000-meter championship event with a time of 14:01.99. Although he was fifth in the race and three seconds behind the winner, Gillepsie’s performance puts him second in the Ivy League. More importantly, Gillepsie now sits fourth on Harvard’s all-time top-10 performance list for the event. “It was a great race for me, a big break-through and a very large improvement for me,” Gillepsie said. “Great race” is an understatement, according to his teammates and coach, especially since Gillepsie demolished his previous best by 22 seconds, almost two seconds faster per lap on a 400-meter track, while qualifying for the NCAA Regionals.“It was a monstrous PR,” said junior distance runner Robert Kenney. “That kind of a leap is almost unprecedented, so it’s a big deal for him personally.”  “It’s pretty significant,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “Obviously, Harvard has a rich history and tradition in track and field. It’s one of the original sports at Harvard, so to have a time that ranks on that all-time list is a great achievement.” The last time someone made it onto the 5000-meter top-10 performance list was in 2003, when Matt Seidel ran a time good enough for sixth. “Harvard has been around for a pretty long time, so it’s a big honor and I’m really happy about it,” Gillepsie said. 	Since starting track in ninth grade, Gillepsie has always wanted to go far, both literally and figuratively. “I’ve had pretty big dreams about running for a long time and they are starting to come true, so it’s very exciting for me,” he said. “I hope that this performance is the tip of the iceberg, so to speak, except a good iceberg.” Remaining modest, Gillepsie also emphasized how although his performance is starting to peak, what’s more important is that the team’s performance is hitting its stride.“We are starting to have big goals, and it’s really exciting to be part of a team that is sort of redefining itself and becoming better every year,” Gillepsie said. “There is a lot of pleasure and satisfaction from getting that experience.”But even though the track and field team has begun to see success, it’s the individual performance that matters. “He has probably the strongest work ethic [on] the team,” Kenney said. “I’m his roommate, and he always makes sacrifices for running—like on the weekends instead of staying out late, he chooses [not to]. That’s something that’s easy to do when you are a freshman here, but not after a few years.” “He’s been a tremendous worker for us and has done a great job buying into the work,” Saretsky said. “He is definitely the type of person who leads by example.” “He’s not a very boisterous personality, but he shows up everyday, works hard, [and] does a great job,” he added. To top it off, Gillepsie does it all with a massive beard. “I think it makes him look like a 40-year-old man,” Saretsky said. “He is certainly a free spirit. It’s his thing and I’m all about the individual.”“I haven’t performed any sort of experiment, but I guess I could shave half of my face and go half as much faster,” Gillepsie joked. “I like having it. It makes eating meals more entertaining and also difficult, and I think that’s a good lesson in humility.”Whether with half of a beard, a full beard, or nothing, Gillepsie still knows how to make it count on the track.“There is still more to be done,” Saretsky said. “He has more potential. It’ll be fun to see how he develops over the next year.” “He, more than any other teammate, really lays it out all on the line, really gives it his all, so there is more in the tank for him,” Kenney said. “He is always excited for running fast…that’s something admirable, to have a pure joy for it, and we all notice it and respect it a lot.”For now, as he prepares for both the end of the year and the start of the championship season, Gillespie continues to focus on just doing what he loves.“I love being on the team, and I love running,” he said. “I’ll be running until the day I die. Maybe later.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems rather fitting that the onset of spring weather this past weekend in Cambridge marked the Harvard sailing team’s busiest weekend of competition, with five regattas over the two days. While the sunny skies and fair conditions were surely enjoyed by the majority of Harvard students on campus, the Crimson sailors seemed to respond especially well to the blue skies and improved climate. After enduring a few recent weeks of struggles, both the Harvard women and the co-ed squad performed beautifully in the fair conditions.
The Crimson women took home runner-up honors at the New England Women’s Championship, a mere three points back of their Ancient Eights rivals from New Haven. The co-ed squad split its top performers on the weekend between the Morris Trophy and the Thompson Trophy and brought home first- and second-place finishes, respectively.
Harvard also had competitors stay close to home and register a sixth-place effort at the Central Series Five regatta and a 12th-place finish at the Wellesley Invitational.
“There were a lot of good regattas taking place this weekend,” sophomore skipper John Stokes said. “The talent was spread around throughout our conference, and we dealt with the conditions well.”
NEW ENGLAND WOMEN’S CHAMPIONSHIP
The Crimson women finished second over the weekend at the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association Women’s Championship in Burlington, Vt., an event co-hosted by the University of Vermont and Dartmouth.
Harvard registered third-place finishes in both the A and B divisions, finishing just three points back of Yale for the overall team trophy. The runner-up placing ensured that the Crimson will be making the cross-country trip to San Francisco for the ICSA Women’s National Championship May 25-27.
“Our main focus was to qualify for nationals and then to concentrate on finishing in the top two, and we were able to do both,” rookie skipper Emily Lambert said.
Senior skipper Megan Watson teamed up with junior crew Liz Powers for five of the eleven races in the A-division, while sophomore crew Meghan Wareham worked the other six contests in the division. The boat finished in the top five of the 15-team field in five of the 11 contests over the two days of competition.
Lambert skippered the B-division boat, with freshman Lilla Cosgrove and senior Lauren Brants splitting time at crew. They registered one victory and two second-place efforts on the weekend.
“This weekend went really well for us,” Lambert said. “We will focus on practicing in heavy winds over the next couple of weeks, because San Francisco is supposed to have some tough conditions and we don’t get heavy winds very often on the Charles.”
MORRIS TROPHY
The Harvard co-ed squad sent a contingent to the Morris Trophy, hosted by Boston University, and earned the team victory. While the weather might have been pleasant, the conditions were nonetheless tricky, as the wind had a significant effect on the two days of competition.
“There were some crazy wind shifts,” Stokes said. “It was nice to be more familiar than the other fleets on how to deal with the conditions on our home river.”
Stokes teamed up with junior crew Michelle Konstadt in the B-division to lead the Crimson’s efforts. The pair won its opening race of the weekend, and was also victorious in its final three competitions on Sunday. The duo’s late charge allowed it to take over Boston College and bring home the division title.
In the A division, the tandem of sophomore skipper Teddy Himler and freshman crew Annie DeAngelo earned a fourth-place finish. They also opened racing on Saturday with a win, and remained consistent throughout the two days and 12 races of the weekend, finishing outside the top five on only three occasions.
The solid team performance provided some great practice for next weekend’s ICSA National Semifinals, co-hosted by Harvard and MIT.
“We were able to avoid most of the weird stuff that happens out there on the river this past weekend,” Stokes said. “We will practice hard this upcoming week, and hope to finish in the top half of next weekend’s regatta and earn a trip to Nationals.”
THOMPSON TROPHY
The other half of the Crimson’s co-ed squad traveled to New London, Conn. over the weekend for the Thompson Trophy, hosted by the US Coast Guard Academy, where it earned a second-place team finish overall. The B-division boat also found success in this competition for Harvard, as the pair of senior skipper Jon Garrity and sophomore crew Grace Charles won the division by 20 points over Boston College. The duo finished among the top half of the 18-team field in all but one of their 18 races on the weekend, earning five victories along the way.
Sophomore co-ed captain Alan Palmer skippered the A-division boat, while fellow second-year Quincy Bock crewed. The pair registered a seventh-place team finish in the division, with six top-three finishes out of 18 races over the two-day affair.
CENTRAL SERIES FIVE
The Crimson also finished sixth overall in the Central Series Five regatta, hosted by MIT on the Charles River on Saturday. Sophomore skipper Colin Santangelo teamed up with freshman crew Ruth Engle to take home runner-up honors in the B division of the competition, earning four victories out of their 11 contests.
WELLESLEY INVITATIONAL
Harvard also competed at the Wellesley Invitational on the Charles River on Sunday. The MIT-hosted event saw the Crimson place 12th in the 16-team field.

Seniors Chris Pizzotti and Desmond Bryant will be joining an illustrious list of Harvard graduates in the NFL, including six-time Pro Bowler Matt Birk and Ryan Fitzpatrick, according to GoCrimson.com.Both players were signed as undrafted free agents—Pizzotti by the New York Jets and Bryant by the Oakland Raiders—following the completion of the 2009 NFL draft on Sunday.Pizzotti left his mark on the Harvard record books, placing himself on a short list of players to have a hand in three Ivy Championships. The fifth-year senior watched from the sidelines as Fitzpatrick led the Crimson to a perfect 10-0 season in 2004, then led two back-to-back championship teams of his own in 2007 and 2008.The Jets used their first-round pick to claim quarterback Mark Sanchez from USC, so Pizzotti will start down the depth chart. Of course, Pizzotti began his collegiate career as a backup to classmate Liam O’Hagan, before taking the spotlight and the starting job following O’Hagan’s suspension.Pizzotti drew heat for his comments to the Boston Globe stating that he was offered a deal by the Jets in the sixth round of the draft, which would have been a violation of NFL rules. Pizzotti later clarified his statement, saying that there was no formal deal agreed on before the draft’s conclusion.At defensive end, Bryant finished the 2008 campaign with 20 total tackles, including 12 solos and eight assisted. Four and a half of those tackles accounted for losses totaling 14 yards.Bryant will be looking to bolster a Raider defense that ranked 31st in rush yards allowed, 27th in total yards allowed, and 24th in points allowed. Oakland finished third in the AFC West last season at 5-11.—DIXON MCPHILLIPS

Bouquets of pink balloons and  glass cases filled with dainty cakes welcomed enthusiastic students  and Cambridge residents alike at the highly anticipated grand opening  of Sweet in Harvard Square. The famed Boston cupcake boutique opened  its doors on Zero Brattle Street at 10 o’clock this morning.
The charming pink-white-and-brown  themed décor, nearly identical to that of Sweet’s original Back Bay  location, features freshly varnished hardwood floors, café tables by  the window, and a flat screen TV displaying Marie Antoinette.
The most popular flavor so  far? “Definitely the red velvet,” confirmed the beaming lady behind  the counter.
Miniature cupcakes (with a one-to-one cupcake-to-frosting ratio!), each under two dollars, and  25-cent frosting shots are also sweet deals for students on a budget.
Now, if you’ll excuse us,  we’re going to go stuff our faces.

Have you recently taken an ax to your ten-year-old ceramic piggy, only to find the bank’s empty? Maybe you spent a little too much on new spring clothes…or more realistically, on late-night coffee runs to Starbucks/JP Licks/7-11/Dunkin Donuts? Fail to get that summer internship at...wait, which banks are left? Was the only summer internship you got unpaid?
If you answered yes to any of the above, never fear, FlyBy is here to help. Some ways to earn cash before the end of the year after the jump.
If you find yourself obsessively cleaning your dorm room while humming “Dude Looks Like a Lady?” (wait for the 1:00 mark), try applying to work for Dorm Crew’s Spring Clean-Up. You can apply online at http://www.dormcrew.com/category/scu. While there is no deadline for submission, a representative at Dorm Crew said to apply as soon as possible because they have already received a lot of applications.
Are you a library junkie? If so, the Fogg Art Museum is looking for a book-stacker. Check out the Student Employment Office’s website for full details: https://harvard.studentemployment.ngwebsolutions.com/JobX_FindAJob.aspx?t=qs&qs=20.
The Fogg lists job requirements: “Attention to detail. Previous library stacks experience helpful. Some computer skill is required. Able to lift in excess of 30lbs.”.
Hmm, FlyBy listed similar details on http://www.fasdate.com. Kidding. Sort of? It’s spring, we’re getting desperate.
Maybe you are more into pretending you’re important…and have a weird clipboard fettish. If so, apply to be a Storage Monitor and “supervise students storing their belongings in the upperclass houses.” Undergraduates can apply online at www.dormcrew.com/storage.

You should have listened to your parents when they told you not to go to Cancun for spring break.  No, not because of the warring drug lords.  Or because of your penchant for tequila shots and wet t-shirt contests. In fact, the reason you shouldn't have gone to Mexico involved neither alcohol nor sex! It was… THE SWINE FLU!
Just kidding. Spring Break happened way before the swine flu pandemic cropped up. And according to Harvard University Health Services Director David S. Rosenthal ’59, that means you're off the hook for your jaunt south of the border:
So unless your southern spring break was a month long, you're probably in the clear.
More flu deets from UHS, after the jump.
Nevertheless, FlyBy knows that some of you are feeling feverish and nauseous just reading this post, and that your parents have been calling for hourly updates about whether any Harvard students have been diagnosed with the swine flu.  Rest easy, UHS has not received any complaints of swine flu-like symptoms from any members of the Harvard community.  They have even posted a link to FAQs about the swine flu on their homepage.
But if you do start to feel sick, make the trek over to UHS where they will hopefully treat you with something stronger than ibuprofen.  And as we learned before with Babson norovirus outbreak, washing your hands is the best way to avoid getting sick. "The most important thing for staying healthy is good hygiene," Rosenthal says. "When you cough, you should cough into your elbow, and not into the phone or onto your friends.”
Sage advice. FlyBy wishes our roommate would follow it.
