After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lambchop (originally called Posterchild), an alternative country band, was formed in Nashville in 1986. The band gained popularity in the 1990s and continues its legacy with its 12th studio album “FLOTUS (For Love Often Turns Us Still)” which will be released Nov. 4th. They have achieved moderate critical acclaim: “Kurt Wagner is best known for his gentle, yet authoritative singing voice and for witty and deeply insightful lyrics, which make room for both the downhome and the abstract, the folksy and the avant garde,” American Songwriter Magazine wrote in 2012. Their most recent album album mesmerizes with sound, but the lyrics are too obscured to adequately portray even the uncomplicated themes of their music.
The album’s greatest strength is the compilation of interesting beats, patterns, and tones that together create transfixing music. This is deeply apparent in the first single from the album, “The Hustle.” The repetition of a beat first blossoms into a soothing melody and returns to percussive repetition, ultimately culminating in a staccato rhythm. Then in “JFK” the music sounds organ-like and then transforms into a sound full of bass, percussion, and repetitions of high-pitched patterns of tones. These layers are primarily created with piano, percussion, bass, guitar, and human voices, which come together to make multi-faceted music.
The instrumental part of “JFK” is transfixing, yet the lyrics are hard to understand—they are either sung softly or overpowered by the versatile tones of the music. As the album title promises, the lyrics meditate on the theme of love; because the instrumental aspects are so overpowering, however, these messages are not clear. In “NIV,” Kurt Wagner sings, “You are faith/You are [unintelligible]/[unintelligible]/You are feeling lonely”. How the subject of faith transforms into loneliness remains unclear. However, their unintelligible lyrics bring attention to the originality of the patterns in the music. Their uniqueness comes through using unintelligible lyrical components—in “Relatives #2” they sing the monosyllabic sound, “Do,” repeatedly. The unintelligible sounds are evidence of the band’s creativity, but they hide the themes of love that the band is trying to convey.
Only occasionally are the lyrics understandable; when they are, the lyrical content is simple and adheres to straightforward themes. An example is “Writer”—the only song that truly brings attention to the lyrics rather than the instrumental. It begins with the words, “Once there was a writer now a reader / Once there was a savior now a spender / Once there was a maker now a repeater / Once there was a friend now a reminder / Once there was a doer now a thinker/  Once there was a fool always a fool.” Here, the proactive (“a doer”) becomes sedentary (“a thinker”). In “The Hustle” Kurt Wagner sings, "It was talk of love in Tennessee / Of the beauty of the seventies.” It is one of the rare moments when they are intelligible and the (now comprehensible) lyrics reflects the love theme of the album.
Past its occasionally intelligible lyricism, the defining aspect of the album is the long melodic instrumental portions that are ultimately empty. “In Care of 8675309” at 11 minutes and 51 seconds is both mesmerizing and repetitive. At a confounding 18 minutes and 13 seconds, the album’s first single “The Hustle,” has very few lyrics. At one point Wagner repeats “Do the hustle” an innumerable number of times. The lyrics of “In Care of 8675309” and the little snippets of miscellaneous sounds in “The Hustle” are heard and then forgotten—unmemorable moments in unnecessarily long songs.
Despite the length of some of the songs, the hidden lyrics, and random unintelligible sounds, “FLOTUS” is extraordinary in musical content. When the lyrics are heard and understood they speak to a coherent theme. When the sounds are intelligible they are pleasurable. When the songs are edited to the proper length they are bearable. With that said, “FLOTUS” is not Lambchop’s prime.

Last week, Scott Bradlee’s Postmodern Jukebox released its fourth single in October—a cover of “Don’t Stop Me Now,” originally performed by Queen in 1978. The YouTube band has consistently created brilliant jazzy-vintage renditions of classic and modern hits. “Don’t Stop Me Now,” featuring Melinda Doolittle, is no exception.
Postmodern Jukebox’s characteristic giddy energy is all over “Don’t Stop Me Now.” Doolittle’s rich, steady voice is a refreshing reminder of the heat and passion that Freddie Mercury himself blitzed on the stage. However, Queen’s original version packed a fiery intensity that Postmodern Jukebox’s rendition does not aim to imitate. Scott Bradlee has a jazzier zing in mind that Danny Janklow’s saxophone and Lemar Guillary’s trombone executes impeccably. Like most of PMJ’s recordings, this one also takes place in Bradlee’s living room. Bradlee accidentally cut himself out of the video this time. “I didn’t have a camera person that day,” he admits online. But what is absent in video is more than made up for in Bradlee’s piano, which dances with Doolittle’s voice gleefully throughout the song.
Midway in the song, Doolittle includes a bit of advice for the listeners that successfully captures the vitality of the music: “We all know life is too short for regrets so I don’t want fear to stop you from doing anything. I want you to go out and love somebody and live your life.”
Freddie Mercury would’ve been proud.

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears! I have come not to bury Vine but to praise it. When it was announced on Oct. 27 that the short video hosting service was being shut down, tastemakers and bloggers around the web eulogized the platform by reposting and reminiscing about their favorite Vines. What’s particularly striking about Vine’s shutdown is that it is the first bastion of internet culture in recent memory to fall without a replacement: Facebook supplanted MySpace as the major social networking site, but nothing will quite replace Vine.
Not to say that it had no competition. In fact, Vine, which launched as mobile-only in late 2013, carved a niche for itself in spite of its competition. Instagram added the ability to post videos up to 15 seconds long in June of the same year. Snapchat, having launched in 2011, gradually added the video sharing services it is now known for over the course of mid-to-late 2013. And this is to say nothing of the juggernauts of Facebook and YouTube.
But Vine’s six-second constraint set it apart and set it up for success. While Snapchat and Instagram became means for users to (passively) share and glamorize aspects of their lives with each other, Vines required effort. Only given six looping seconds to set up and deliver a joke, users mastered making use of all aspects of their medium. Some simply nailed the execution of a short joke. Other used the loop itself as a punchline. Others crammed as much absurdity into the video as possible. All elevated what could have ended up as a cheap fad to a fine craft.
Of course, much of this is (embellished) old news. However, Vine’s less recognized role as a social network is what should be praised most of all. YouTube’s promotional algorithm rewards frequent uploads, and users reward high production value videos: Put the two together, and being ‘YouTube famous’ requires the time and money to shoot and edit professional level content continually. Vine, which didn’t even have a web platform till 2014, just required an app-enabled phone and some comedy chops.
As a result, the barriers to entry for many people of color were dropped, rooting the service in the same (pre-)teen community that underlies ‘black Twitter’ and ‘black Tumblr’. And just as pop culture incorporates many aspects of black culture, the Vine-memes that have made their way into pop internet culture leave a clear paper trail: on fleek, “Why you always lying,” even the app’s own slogan. At the core of this community—and thus Vine at large—was an almost wholesome sense of joy that gave members the opportunity to freely enjoy their black experience as a place of comfort and celebration. There will be no similar place for that community to go.
At the risk of dabbling in armchair economics, Vine’s fall hints at a potential future for pop culture: The business models that have linked cultural and financial value are beginning to lose their effectiveness. Hopefully, we’ll find ways to support the myriad sources of cultural value; otherwise, who knows what pop culture will have preemptively lost.
Nevertheless, goodbye Vine. You made us laugh, pushed us to create, and gave us a home. Maybe we’ll see you in another life.

America’s prophet of doom won the election, and now liberals are the ones forecasting apocalypse. After Donald J. Trump’s upsetting upset victory, reports of racially motivated harassment and violence have surfaced from Pennsylvania to California. Trump has yet to swagger into the White House, but he has already managed to create a miasma of hatred that has left America wondering what could possibly be worse than four loathsome years of a Trump presidency.
That question is depressingly easy to answer: A Trump loss.
Trump’s victory has fomented hatred already, but his loss would have plunged the country into an existential political crisis. If the left believes Trump’s victory has inspired an unacceptable amount of contempt among the public, we ought to consider the hostility that would have been instigated had he failed.
Trump’s dangerous electoral cynicism and predilection for thuggish behavior were a powder keg that was prepared to blow if he lost—and that was when the polls showed him losing. What would have happened if he and Clinton traded places, with Trump winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College, right after polls foreshadowed a win for him?
Trump sycophant Roger Stone put it concisely when he predicted a “bloodbath.”
From the beginning of his run and up until the eve of his victory, Trump expressed unprecedented contempt for the country’s electoral system. He said that the election was “rigged.” He warned of voter fraud. He even peddled an ugly conspiracy theory that billionaire George Soros controlled the election. Girding himself for loss like a petulant child, he whined that that game was fixed.
And his supporters believed him. Polls that showed staggering majorities of them worried about voter fraud, secret conspiracies to fix the election, and improper counting of votes. Crowds cheered as Trump joked that he would accept the election results—but only if he won. Trump successfully whipped up a delirium of doubt in our electoral process with the alacrity of a third world strongman.
But the problem was not just that Trump was exceptionally jaundiced. His supporters were also exceptionally violent. Armed with the doubt incited by Trump, their post-loss mutiny would have been calamitous—all because Trump is incapable of containing his ego, all because he is a self-proclaimed “winner.”
We have seen the Trump who wins: He is a scammer, a lecher, a sexual assaulter, and a xenophobe. But the Trump who loses is an unknown quantity because even when he loses, he manages to spin his small potatoes defeats into victories.
Yet to spin a presidential loss into a presidential win is a fool’s errand for even the most deluded loser. Trump may have convinced his base that the election was trumped up, but the weight of history and reality stood in the way of his ludicrous claim from catching on. So if Trump lost this time, he was going to lose for real, and we were going to see the real, unknown, dangerous losing Trump.
And that losing Trump was poised to wreak havoc. With no political career to salvage, and nothing to lose, Trump was prepared to goad his bellicose supporters into breaking all hell loose, causing an unprecedented electoral crisis—all to save his massive, fragile ego. The results would have been devastating for our country. There would be political pandemonium. For every instance of hatred the country has seen since Trump’s win, there would have been countless more for a Trump loss.
The “winning” Trump is odious, but at least we know who he is. The losing Trump is an unknown who was prepared to unleash a wave of unforeseen terror.
We are lucky that that terror never materialized. Because the candidate who respects our electoral system lost, and the candidate who disdains it won, we averted crisis. In a twisted way, we are fortunate that Trump won—it is not far-fetched to think that liberals would be thinking the grass were greener right now if Trump lost and made good on his promise to stir up chaos.
It is not fair that Democrats had to be the adults in the room and graciously accept loss. But their integrity is what will ensure that our electoral system continues to function properly. When historians look back at this bizarre election, they will note that it was ironically Clinton’s loss that kept our country from descending into hellish Trumpian bedlam.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee passed legislation requiring a majority of the executive board members of student groups that receive substantial UC funding to attend sexual assault trainings conducted by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators.
This week, a joint agreement between the UC, OSAPR, and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ Student Advisory Committee took this initiative a step further. Beginning in the spring, student groups that receive Harvard Foundation funding and whose entire executive boards attend sexual assault training are eligible for a 20 percent increase in funding from the Foundation, while groups with attendance from at least half of the board could gain a 10 percent funding bump.
We commend both the UC and the Harvard Foundation for conceiving and implementing this policy. A cynical observer might point out that each year’s campaign for the UC presidency and vice-presidency inevitably leads to discussion of three issues: Candidates promise to expand mental health resources, to improve access to social spaces, and to reduce the prevalence of sexual assault. But despite the lofty goals articulated during UC campaigns, students often lament the lack of tangible actions the Council can take.
The sexual assault trainings introduced last spring, as well as this new policy, run counter to that narrative. We hope that students see these new trainings as an opportunity for progress toward a safer and more inclusive community, and not as an unnecessary burden on their extracurricular organizations.
As the Council moves forward under new leadership, the ingenuity that led to the implementation of this partnership should not be lost. The ability to disburse student group funding is the UC’s most important policy tool, and this new policy is clearly an effective use of it. It also highlights the key role that partnerships between different organizations can play in ensuring that our campus is as safe as possible. In particular, other grant making organizations like the Harvard Foundation are well positioned to help the UC in similar initiatives.
Though we support the UC’s current set of programs to encourage training, we find it unfortunate that financial incentives are still the most effective means of connecting students to in-person trainings. We do not doubt that the program would be less effective were it not tied to financial incentives, but we fear its reach will be limited to student groups that already struggle with funding—like cultural organizations—and not effect well-established groups. We continue to hope that the College will mandate annual in-person trainings for all undergraduates so that our entire community can make good on its commitment to a campus free of sexual violence.
Until the administration acts, however, the UC’s new initiative is a good provisional step and an important expansion of a program we supported when it was launched last spring. Sexual assault has plagued this campus far too long. Though more decisive action is needed, not taking action is simply not a conscionable option.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The wave of gentrification that has swept Harvard Square over the past year has been nothing short of remarkable. Since last spring we have seen at least four versions of arguably the same restaurant—Tatte, Flour, Sweetgreen, and Clover—crop up in the busiest parts of the Square. One newcomer that you might have missed is called Tom’s Bao Bao—a Chinese bao shop located next to Shake Shack that opened quietly over the summer.
At first, Tom’s Bao Bao looks like just another one of the new wave of Made-for-Instagram eating establishments that have taken over the Square, complete with a cool SquareSpace website and stratospheric markups. Until you think back to all of the Chinese restaurants you’ve encountered in your life and realize that you’ve never, ever seen anything like it before—upmarket and trendy, after all, are not words typically associated with places serving Chinese food. Tom’s Bao Bao is as far as it gets from trapezoidal take-out boxes and lunch specials. So how did we get here? When I look out into Harvard Square, I see three Chinese restaurants that, together, tell the story of Chinese immigration into America in three parts.
Our story begins at the Kong. Hong Kong Restaurant & Lounge is the oldest Chinese establishment in the Square and, with its glowing lucky red-and-yellow sign set in oriental-looking English letters, represents what probably springs to mind when most people imagine a Chinese restaurant. Walk inside and your initial impression is confirmed. A lucky golden cat made of plastic waves his paw at you from the reception counter. An antique store dragon spreads its body across one of the dining room walls. The waiters wear their black-and-white outfits and professional curtness like costumes from an 80's movie, and the whole interior is drowned in an orange, corn syrup light. At night, drunken revelers, sometimes dressed in formal wear, crowd the tables in groups of ten and order prodigally off of the menu: General Gao’s Chicken, crab rangoons, chop suey, and scallion pancakes. American food disguised as Chinese food—just add soy sauce. Yet the most ingenious item on the menu must be the scorpion bowl: a stone-colored soup bowl filled with a “secret” mix of bottom-shelf liquor, sold for $20, that serves to encourage the drunken ordering of even more food. As a profit-generating enterprise, it is tough not to admire the Kong.
The reason why this recipe—and I’m not just talking about the food here, but the whole shtick, lights, decorations, everything—is so effective is because it’s been tested and iterated on throughout history. Restaurants like the Kong have been around for nearly 200 years; the first ever recorded, which we might consider to be the Kong’s historical doppelganger, was called Canton Restaurant, and opened its doors in 1849 to the overworked and meat-starved gold miners of San Francisco. The Kong’s predecessor was also a place of revelry, with enough seating for 300 miners and English speaking bartenders to pour them their favorite poison. Like everyone who set out west, the first wave of Chinese immigrants into America sought gold—but not in the mountains. They were too smart for that, realizing that competing directly would only antagonize the white men who felt that the buried gold was their birthright. Rather, the enterprising immigrants recognized the massive opportunity in providing essential services to these miners, such as laundry and, more importantly, food. There was only one problem—how to get these white men to actually eat the strange offerings of their cuisine? Cue the process of culinary trial and error, adapting Chinese recipes to American tastes. We have the ingenuity of these early entrepreneurs to thank for the familiar fare at the Kong today.
The second part of our story takes place in Cilantro Chinese Cuisine, the small basement mom-and-pop restaurant downstairs from Boston Burger Company on Mass Ave. If you’ve ever wandered inside here you’ll remember the subdued lighting and quiet, respectful atmosphere—more akin to someone’s living room than the Kong. The second thing you notice is the difference in clientele—the diners are almost all Chinese, likely students at the College or one of the grad schools who come here when they miss home. A glance at the menu reveals why. After a page of “standard hits” including Kung Pau Chicken and crab rangoons you rapidly venture into unfamiliar territory: sautéed frog legs in chili sauce, crispy pork intestines, Shanghai pork trotters. Restaurants like Cilantro represent the second wave of Chinese immigration that took place nearly a century after the first, which was the diaspora of political exiles after the Chinese civil war in 1949. Millions of people whose political affiliations did not align with the Communist Party were forced out of the country. Most of them settled in Taiwan, but a sizable portion found their way to America as well. Wherever they went, they brought their food, and memories of home, with them. In fact, the diaspora of 1949 spurred on a Chinese culinary Renaissance of sorts. In this case the driving force was sentiment, not profit—exiles sought to reproduce the dishes they grew up with, from a land now far away. Which is why restaurants like Cilantro emphasize their local origins. It’s not just Chinese food—it’s Sichuan food.
A watershed moment in American Chinese culinary history took place in 1972, when President Richard Nixon attended a formal banquet held in his honor by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai in the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square. From the comfort of their homes millions of Americans watched their president eat such exotic foods as Peking Duck, shark’s fin soup, pickled fish, and bamboo shoots. The next day, phone lines at Chinese restaurants all over the country exploded. The people wanted to know what their president ate, and they wanted it on their own plates. Nixon’s Chinese banquet created a seismic shift in the Chinese food industry in America. Suddenly people became less interested in crab rangoons and more interested in “authentic” Chinese food. Chinese became disassociated from cheap. Fast forward a decade or two—over China’s economic rise, the influx of a new generation of wealthy immigrants and expats—and suddenly we see the rise of a new, upmarket and culturally ambiguous Chinese food, which gets us, finally, to Tom’s Bao Bao. The new Chinese restaurateurs aren’t cash-strapped immigrants trying to turn a profit or sorrowful exiles yearning to recreate a lost home. Sometimes they’re a generation or two removed from their roots, part of a new creative generation empowered to forge a new Chinese American culinary identity. They include people like Amelie Kang, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, who started her restaurant called MáLà Project in New York's East Village; Eric Sze, owner of The Tang; Yiming Wang and Xian Zhang, the owners of China Blue, a café that takes its elegant look from 1930s Shanghai. Their rapid rise to the top makes me smile; it signifies, above all else, a newfound cultural confidence, creative agency, and commitment to authenticity.

We will not be intimidated by these cowardly attacks and we will stand in vigorous support of any member of our community affected by or concerned with the racist, xenophobic, misogynistic state of affairs sanctioned by the most recent presidential election. We strongly condemn these and all acts of violence, these and all acts of hateful speech.
We stand united in defense of immigrant rights.
Sincerely,
Sergio DelgadoVirginie GreeneMariano Siskind

A Harvard Open Data Project analysis predicts that Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and running mate Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 will likely be the winners of the UC presidential election.
The election features four tickets running to be next year’s UC leaders: Scott Ely ’18 with running mate Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 with running mate Alex Popovski ’19, Sachee with running mate Khansarinia, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 with running mate Alexander T. Moore ’18. Voting concluded Thursday at noon. 
The Open Data Project initiative—called “SixteenThirtySix”—analyzed each campaign’s social media presence, endorsements from campus clubs and other UC representatives, and a survey the group conducted to predict the results of the election.
Chris Kuang ’20 and Athena Kan ’19 worked on the initiative, with assistance from students including Brian Sapozhnikov ’19 and Pforzheimer House UC representative Neel Mehta ’18. The Harvard Open Data Project is a student team that conducts statistical analyses on campus-related data sets.
Predicting Sachee and Khansarinia’s victory, Kuang wrote in a Medium post that the pair were the most popular among freshmen and most effective with social media.
“We believe that Yaz and Cam’s formidable advantage on social media and with the freshman class is a winning combination,” Kuang wrote.
More than 240 students responded to the Open Data Project’s survey, or about 3.5 percent of students eligible to vote. Of those who responded, 81 students—or about one third of respondents—said they would vote for Sachee and Khansarinia, followed closely by the 75 who said they would vote for Gonzalez and Popovski.
Fifty-nine students said they would vote for Ely and Bonsall, while just six said they would vote for Solomon and Moore. Twenty-three students said they did not plan to vote in the election.
Among freshmen, Sachee and Khansarinia had a clearer lead, with 44 percent of freshmen respondents indicating that they planned to vote for them. Sophomores and seniors, meanwhile, were most likely to vote for Ely and Bonsall, while juniors were most likely to vote for Gonzalez and Popovski.
The analysis concluded that Gonzalez and Popovski led in endorsements from campus clubs and organizations, while Ely and Bonsall led in endorsements from current UC representatives.
Sachee and Khansarinia led on the report’s social media metrics. Their Facebook page has garnered nearly 500 “likes” as of Thursday afternoon. In comparison, the next most popular Facebook page is Gonzalez and Popovski’s, which had 230 as of that time.
This initiative marks the first attempt by the Open Data Project to predict the results of a UC election. Kuang said though the group was confident in their prediction, additional data could have helped to strengthen the group’s confidence.
“Professional pollsters and predictions are often wrong too (in 2016 especially) so there are always trends that...data fail to show,” Kuang wrote in an email to The Crimson.
The results of the election will be announced Thursday evening.

With less than two months until a new administration moves into the White House, some Harvard professors and researchers say they are worried about how Donald Trump’s presidency could affect federal funding for scientific research.
For some science professors and researchers, Trump’s previous comments about climate change and the appointment of Myron Ebell, who has challenged research about climate change, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency during the transition do not bode well for federal research funding at universities. Ebell is the Director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group based in Washington, D.C.
Andrew Berry, a lecturer on Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, said that he reacted with “shock and horror” when hearing of Trump’s election victory. He said that the Trump administration’s attitude towards evolution and climate change is particularly alarming.
“Climate change denial is problematic because of climate change, but also because it’s symptomatic of a general anti-science, ignore-science perspective,” he said. “The notion that you can be the leader of a country which is technologically advanced and yet deny some really basic, fundamental truths, and it’s upon scientific truth that all of technology is built, is disturbing.”
He said he expects Trump’s administration to reduce the amount of federal funding available for scientific research.
“My guess is that basic science research and research that relates to issues with which the administration is uncomfortable will be biggest losers,” he said.
Katherine Ellen von Stackelberg, a research scientist at the School of Public Health, said she expects her own research on environmental decision-making to be affected.
“One of my sources of funding is… the Science To Achieve Results program, and I’m guessing that funding for those kinds of grant mechanisms will be reduced or eliminated entirely,” she said.
Peter F. Huybers, an environmental science professor, said the current situation is similar to when former President George W. Bush and his administration decided to limit funding for stem cell research. After this change, Harvard created the Stem Cell Center in 2004 to fund research independently of the government.

Hoping to improve the stem cell transplant process and broaden access to some cancer treatments, Harvard has granted the Cambridge-based technological startup Magenta Therapeutics access to a suite of technologies partly patented by the University.
David T. Scadden, chair of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology and a professor at Harvard Medical School, has led the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in researching ways to use stem cells in medical care. Magenta Therapeutics was created to commercialize this research, according to Vivian Berlin, director of business development and life sciences at Harvard’s Office of Technology Development, which oversaw the license agreement with Magenta. Scadden is the chair of Magenta’s scientific advisory board.
“When we think about commercializing technology we think whether they would fit within the current paradigm of existing companies or whether it would make more sense to form a company around the technology,” said Berlin.  “David really felt, and we agreed with him, that the best route for further developing the technology would be through the formation of the startup.”
The patents—owned by Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Boston Children’s Hospital—will help Magenta offer a suite of technologies in stem cell transplantation, which is used in the treatment of some types of cancers, according to Berlin.
Stem cell transplants are a multi-stage process, involving the harvesting, expanding, and grafting of the cells. The technologies, partly stemming from Scadden’s research, aim to make each stage of the process less toxic and more effective. Traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy, generally do damage to the body. The new therapies use antibodies to target cancer cells in hopes of making the treatment non-toxic.
“These are technologies that really are game-changing, paradigm-shifting,” Berlin said.
Founded by stem cell experts, Magenta Therapeutics recieved $48.5 million in seed capital from investors and currently consists of 20 employees. Christina Isaacson, Magenta’s vice president and head of business development, said they hope to double this number next year.
“We have a really rock solid team,” said Isaacson. “We’re really excited.”
Scadden said the application of his research to real-life health outcomes is heartening.
“To be able to advance a laboratory finding toward clinical application is a dream as a physician-scientist,” he said. “It is such a privilege to work at Harvard where this is accepted, encouraged, and made possible by the ecosystem in which we operate.”

Due to allegations that Undergraduate Council presidential candidates or campaign staff violated campaign rules, the UC executive board voted in an “urgent” meeting Thursday night to grant the UC Election Commission extra time to certify the results of the UC’s presidential election.
“The Election Commission is currently investigating concerns,” UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said.
UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18 and Rather declined to comment further on the nature of the allegations.
Voting for this year’s UC presidential election ended Thursday at noon. The UC Election Commission typically has 24 hours after the end of the voting period—or until Friday at noon—to calculate and certify the results of the election. Due to the vote, the Commission now has until Saturday at noon to certify the results.
This year’s UC presidential election featured four tickets: Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18.
The vote came at the end of an “urgent exec meeting” among members of the executive board, according to an email Rather sent to UC executives at 8:35 p.m.
The executive board convened in the Student Organization Center at Hilles at 9 p.m.
Because of their statuses as UC committee chairs, Ely, Sachee, and Khansarinia were present at the meeting.
At the meeting, a majority of the executive board voted to enter executive session—a rare private, off-the-record session of the Council, whose meetings are normally open to the public. During the meeting, Estes requested “a 24-hour extension to certify the 2016 UC Presidential Election Results in order to investigate allegations of campaign violations.”
A majority of executive board members voted to approve the extension. All executive board members other than UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 and Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 were in attendance at the meeting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Square businesses are preparing for an influx of new customers this weekend as thousands of alumni and Yale students descend on Cambridge for the annual Harvard-Yale game Saturday.
The contest, which regularly draws tens of thousands of students and alumni, will be hosted at Harvard Stadium this year, and many local restaurants and retailers are hoping to capture a slice of the football crowd.
“It’s a good time for the Harvard community, it’s a great time for Harvard Square,” said Jerry P. Murphy ’73, president of the Harvard Coop.
Bill Bartley, owner of Bartley’s Burgers, the burger restaurant known for its creatively named offerings such as the “Snoop Dogg” and the “Fiscal Cliff,” said that despite the swelled crowds, business will proceed as usual. He added that he didn’t see the extra customers from Harvard-Yale as a particularly difficult accommodation.
“We’ve been in the Harvard-Yale buzz for almost as long as Harvard’s been playing Yale,” Bartley said. “So it’s not really that big of a deal.”
Though the burger shop is prepared for increased capacity, Bartley said in recent years fewer Yale students have stopped by his Massachusetts Avenue location. Indeed, Bartley said he has noticed more new customers for the Harvard-Dartmouth football games than for Harvard-Yale games.
Tzurit Or, founder of Tatte, the bakery and cafe that opened last month in Panera’s former Harvard Square location on Massachusetts Avenue, said she looked forward to the game as an opportunity to learn more about the tradition.
“We’re likely going to learn a lot and come up with some local ideas for next year,” she said.
Some businesses said they were going to be offering special merchandise or offers for the game.
Murphy said the Coop will display special Harvard-Yale merchandise to attract the many alumni and students who use the Coop as a place to meet up on game day. He also said the Coop will have several locations set up around the Stadium for sales during the game.
“We really make sure there’s a lot of merchandise,” he said.
According to Or, Tatte may feature special Harvard-Yale offerings for its popular weekend brunch.
“We’re likely going to include some really special brunch,” she said.
Regardless of the result on the gridiron, where Harvard has won the last nine consecutive contests, Bartley said he’ll enjoy the crowd.
“We look forward to the challenge of feeding them all,” Bartley said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 350 faculty members signed a letter Wednesday urging University President Drew G. Faust and other Harvard administrators to protect undocumented students in the wake of Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States.
The letter—published in The Crimson and co-authored by Fine Arts and African and African American Studies Professor Suzanne P. Blier, English Professor Stephen L. Burt ’93, and History and African and African American Studies Professor Walter Johnson—argues that the University has an obligation to protect students to the best of its ability and uphold its stated ideals of diversity.
In the letter, the professors list six actions for administrators to take, including designating Harvard a sanctuary campus and refusing to release information regarding citizenship status.
The letter was written in response to student-organized efforts to champion undocumented students after Trump’s election, which has prompted concern about protections for undocumented students on campus and nationwide. More than 4,000 people have signed a petition urging Harvard to take action, and on Monday supporters gathered on the steps of Widener Library for a rally. At the rally, undocumented students spoke about their experiences and attendees marched to University Hall to deliver the petition to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana.
Blier said she was struck by a need to “say something” in response to the mobilization of support for undocumented students, and she and Johnson decided to collaborate on a letter. Burt joined the effort later.
“I think a lot of faculty are concerned with the situation, and feel it’s important in terms of protecting students and faculty and addressing the situation here at home,” Blier said.
According to Blier, the three professors wrote the letter before various administrators emailed messages that responded to some concerns raised in the petition. On Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust sent an email to students, faculty, and staff that did not explicitly mention undocumented students, but affirmed Harvard’s commitment to protecting its students more broadly.
“We have an obligation to provide all members of our community with an environment in which they can live in safety and dignity,” Faust wrote. In the past, Faust has met with elected officials to lobby for more protections for undocumented university students.
On Wednesday, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair sent an email to College students addressing some of the concerns raised in the petition and letter. She wrote that Loc Truong, the Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs for the Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, has been working to identify resources for undocumented students and has met with members of Act on a Dream, a student immigration advocacy group.
O’Dair also wrote that the College had hired a search consultant to help fill the position of Assistant Dean for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, which has been vacant since mid-October.
Beyond the administrative communications, Burt said the faculty was an important additional show of support for the undocumented students.
“I do think that the faculty letter was a useful show of support from faculty for the safety and confidence of all students at all Harvard, so I think it was important,” Burt said.
Burt said the letter was also a way for faculty who supported the mission of the student petition—but not every specific action that it called for—to add their voice to the cause.
The faculty signees come from across Harvard’s departments and schools, and the document continues to receive signatures. Blier said she hadn’t expected such a high volume of support.
“I’ve been hugely stunned and gratified by the vast number of faculty who have come to me and others to sign on to it,” she said.
Johnson said he was also surprised by the overwhelmingly positive response to the letter, and that he hopes it marks the beginning of a dialogue about undocumented students and a “robust” meaning of sanctuary for those students.
“I do think that it’s time for the University, for the faculty, to start to build capacity to try to protect our students,” he said.

Ahead of Saturday’s Harvard-Yale football game, events meant to bolster school spirit have swept Houses and the Yard to rally Harvard’s campus for the annual festivities.
With Facebook filters and “H” sweaters, undergraduates seek to rouse the College behind a hoped-for Harvard victory.
Groups like the Undergraduate Council, the College Events Board, and the First-Year Social Committee have all planned Harvard-Yale themed events, in addition to events planned by the College’s Office of Student Life and the Freshman Dean’s Office. While some programs are Harvard-Yale traditions—like the Harvard Glee Club’s Harvard-Yale Football Concert, now in its 117th year—others are happening for the first time this year.
One such event is “HYpe,” a dance in Memorial Hall open to both Harvard and Yale undergraduates that will take place Friday night.
HYpe was inspired by a biennial Harvard-Yale dance at Toad’s Place nightclub in New Haven, Conn., according to Jackson Grigsby ’20, co-chair of the CEB’s committee to plan “spirit week” events for the Game.
“We really wanted to bring something like that here,” Grigsby said.
In addition to the dance, Grigsby said HYpe will feature food trucks and a bonfire in the Science Center Plaza. Grigsby compared the event to last month’s “Haunted Hall,” a College-wide dance in Annenberg several days before Halloween.
“We’re just taking even a step up from Haunted Hall and really ensuring that this is an unforgettable event,” Grigsby said.
The CEB also arranged daily giveaways in the Science Center Plaza throughout the week. Some students, for example, danced in front of passersby alongside students dressed as Harvard’s and Yale’s mascots to win exclusive Harvard-Yale t-shirts.
According to Marie-Elizabeth Keil ’14, a fellow at the FDO, the FYSC spent several weeks planning this year’s freshman tailgate, which is set for Saturday morning at the Beren Tennis Center, and ordered hundreds of temporary tattoos and custom foam fingers for the occasion. At the tailgate, students will also be able to win water bottles, hats, and scarves from the Harvard Coop, Keil said.
“The FYSC is really excited to welcome the Class of 2020, which for most of them is their first football game,” Keil said. “It’s just a nice chance to see everyone, drink some hot cocoa, stay warm, and have fun in a safe environment.”
Other student groups are also attempting to harness school spirit with a variety of planned arts events on Friday and Saturday nights. On Friday, the Glee Club will perform Harvard’s original fight songs in its annual concert, and on Saturday, Harvard and Yale music groups are planning a “talent showcase.”
“It’s just cool to meet people at Yale who are involved in the same things as we are,” said Nina C. Sapers ’17, a member of the Harvard Stand-up Comic Society, which also has a show planned for Friday night.
Several students who will be watching the Game at Harvard for the first time said they were excitement for the weekend.
“I’m looking forward to it because I’ll have somewhere to sleep this year,” said Joseph Zuckerman ’19, a member of the CEB.

UPDATED: November 18, 2016 at 4:35 a.m.
Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 will be the next Undergraduate Council President and Vice President after an hours-long investigation found there was insufficient evidence that the pair had violated campaign rules, according to UC Election Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
“We are just so absolutely thrilled and grateful and thankful to the student body for putting their support in us and for believing in our vision, and we look forward to… making a lot of changes this year,” Sachee said.
At 9 p.m. Thursday, the UC executive board held a last-minute meeting in response to allegations that Sachee and Khansarinia violated election rules. In the meeting, which current UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 described as “urgent” in an email to UC executives, the board voted to grant the Election Commission more time to certify the results of the election. The investigation reviewed “whether or not their campaign was involved in any sort of coercive activity”—allegations that had been brought against the UC ticket Thursday morning—according to Estes. Estes declined to comment further on the nature of the investigation.
All executive board members other than UC Vice President Daniel V. Banks ’17 and Student Life Committee Chair Berkeley Brown ’18 were in attendance at Thursday night’s meeting.
Early Friday morning, the five members of the UC Election Commission—who are independent of the UC’s executive board—unanimously agreed that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Sachee and Khansarinia’s campaign had “in any way engaged in coercive behavior.”
According to three individuals with direct knowledge of the executive board meeting’s proceedings, the allegation concerned whether incoming members of the Bee Club, Harvard’s oldest female final club, were coerced into voting for or assisting in the campaign for Sachee, a Bee Club member, and Khansarinia. Ultimately, the committee ruled that there was “not a case to be made” that their campaign had violated the rules.
Sachee and Khansarinia edged out three other tickets: Scott Ely ’18 and Evan M. Bonsall ’19, Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18 and Alex Popovski ’19, and Grant S. Solomon ’18 and Alexander T. Moore ’18.
Sachee and Khansarinia received the most number of first-choice votes, with 1,325 undergraduates listing them as their first choice. Gonzalez and Popovski received the second-greatest number of first-choice votes with 1,028 votes. Ely and Bonsall received 521 first-choice votes, and Solomon and Moore received 168 first-choice votes.
During the voting period, 3,042 undergraduates cast ballots for the UC presidency, a slight increase over last election’s 2,898 ballots.
Voting for this year’s UC presidential election ended Thursday at noon. The UC Election Commission typically has 24 hours after the end of the voting period—or until Friday at noon—to calculate and certify the results of the election. Because of the executive board vote, the Commission had extended its deadline to Saturday at noon—though the Commission announced the winners just after 1:30 a.m. Friday.
Undergraduates also voted on three referendum questions during the election.
The first question, which asked students whether they thought the College should repeal its sanctions on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, passed. Because the policy was formulated by the College itself, the referendum has no bearing on whether the sanctions will go into effect.
The other two questions—one that asked whether the Harvard Turkey should become the official mascot of the University, and another that questioned whether unrecognized single-gender social organizations should go co-ed—did not pass.

Robert E. Grady ’79 is in the running to become the Secretary of Energy or Secretary of Interior in President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, according to Politico, making him the latest Harvard affiliate to be linked to Trump’s transition.
Grady, a partner at Gryphon Investors, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, was a speechwriter and adviser for President George H.W. Bush and served as an associate director for the Office of Management and Budget under Bush's administration.
The reports about Grady’s possible appointment comes on the heels of the news that Harvard lecturer and Dunster House resident dean Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo will join Trump’s transition team as “Executive Authority Adviser.” Rosillo teaches the popular course Government 1359: “The Road to the White House.”
Grady, who lived in Quincy House during his time at Harvard, graduated with a cum laude degree in History.
“He was really one of the most dynamic, energetic, smart, and popular students in our class. He was also a really good student, which was one of the things that stood out,” said John Donley ’79, a close friend of Grady’s at Harvard. “He was the only undergraduate [teaching fellow] I can remember.”
While at Harvard, Grady was a writer for The Crimson, writing mostly about sports. He was also heavily involved in student activism against the apartheid regime in South Africa, according to Donley.
“Bob is one of the smartest, most capable and charming people I know, and genuinely committed to public service,” Jonathan H. Alter ’79, a former senior editor of Newsweek who was on The Crimson with Grady, wrote in an e-mail. “He was focused on social justice issues at Harvard but even then was a Republican and he went on to work for a moderate Republican congresswoman (Millicent Fenwick of NJ) shortly after graduation.”
Donley, on the other hand, said, “I couldn’t have told if he was a Democrat or a Republican in college, but he was intellectually curious about policy.”
Both Donley and Alter said that if Grady were chosen to head either the Energy or the Interior department, his skills would benefit the Trump administration.
Donley cited Grady’s experience in the Bush administration, where he was instrumental in negotiating amendments to the bipartisan Clean Air Act.
“People think politics is polarized now, but it was also polarized then, and he did a good job of building a bridge,” said Donley.
“He’s much more conservative nowadays than I am, but his pragmatism and balanced approach to growth and the environment would make him a good fit for the Trump administration,” Alter wrote.
Grady did not respond to a request for comment.

Hundreds of sophomores gathered in Annenberg Hall Thursday to celebrate the passing of the College’s concentration declaration deadline and their newly-declared plans of study.
The freshly-minted concentrators chatted, munched on hors d’oeuvres and desserts, posed for a photo booth, and penned letters to their future selves at the “Concentration Declaration” event, now in its second year.
For some sophomores, the concentration decision was straightforward. Derek Peng ’19, a new Economics concentrator, noted that his freshmen coursework helped him make his decision early in his first year.
“I was really impressed with [Economics] 10a and 10b,” two popular introductory Economics courses at Harvard, Peng said. Last year, a plurality of sophomores declared concentrations in Economics.
Others, including newly-declared English concentrator Mitchell P. Johns ’19, decided on their concentrations in the weeks leading up to the declaration deadline.
According to Johns, English “was not exactly” sure what he was planning on studying at Harvard, and when he first arrived on campus he was interested in Computer Science.
Still, despite declaring their new fields of study, some students remain uncertain of their future academic plans.
Although Kieren Kresevic Salazar ’19 declared his concentration in Economics, he is still waiting on administrative approval for his proposed joint concentration in Economics and Comparative Literature.
“Ec doesn’t really allow you to join them together, so we’ll see how that goes and whether I can piece them together,” Salazar said.
Brandi Moore ’19 declared Human Evolutionary Biology, but said she remains open to switching to Integrative Biology.
“It’s easy to switch between the two degrees, so it’s not really a big deal,” Moore said.
Students are allowed to switch concentrations until their second to last semester at the College, so long as they fulfill their academic requirements.
Several students, including Lujia Yang ’19 and Anna Z. Zhou ’19, said the College’s Sophomore Advisors, Peer Advising Fellows, and department staff were helpful in narrowing down concentration options. Zhou, an Applied Mathematics concentrator, said her academic advisers guided her throughout the process and connected her with people within the Applied Mathematics department.
In a speech to the newly-declared concentrators, Federico Cortese, conductor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra and Senior Lecturer on Music, urged students to think of their concentrations in terms of self-discovery rather than professional goals.

Four cases of mumps have been confirmed on Harvard’s campus, according to Harvard University Health Services Director Paul J. Barreira, marking the return of active cases of the contagious disease that swept across campus in the spring.
In the spring, a mumps outbreak ultimately resulted in 66 active cases on campus, and the University quarantined some students to try and prevent the spread of disease. No active cases of the disease were on campus in September.
It is unclear whether the new cases are connected to the previous outbreak, which began in February. HUHS is collaborating with local and state public health officials to “track and monitor the situation,” according to Barreira.
“At this time, public health officials are still investigating the origins of these cases to determine whether they are officially connected to the other cases at Harvard or are isolated incidents,” Barreira wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates.
As Harvard prepares for thousands of Yale students to come to Cambridge for this weekend’s annual Harvard-Yale football game, Barreira said he and HUHS are working to contain the disease. In his email, Barreira urged any individuals experiencing mumps symptoms of the disease to “refrain from public activities, avoid travel and public transportation, and contact Harvard University Health Services.”
The outbreak began in February, when HUHS confirmed the first two infections on Harvard’s campus. Mumps cases steadily rose throughout the semester, and there were 58 active cases at the end of the 2015-2016 academic year.
Harvard and Mass. state health officials said earlier this year that they thought the decline in infection over the summer was due to students’ departures from Harvard for the summer.
Barreira wrote in a separate email Thursday evening that HUHS “is actively working with groups from across the University to keep the Harvard community informed about best practices for preventing the spread of mumps.”
On Wednesday, the Boston Globe reported that Tufts University identified nine additional cases of the disease in the past three weeks. Tufts and Boston University also had mumps outbreaks in the spring.

A year after a racially-charged act of vandalism shook the Law School and sparked an intense period of race-related activism, Law School student affinity groups are presenting a visual exhibit at the school to mark the anniversary of the incident.
On November 19, 2015, Law students and faculty walked into Wasserstein Hall to find pieces of black tape stuck across the portraits of black Law professors. The incident triggered an ultimately inconclusive police investigation and prompted Law School Dean Martha L. Minow to call racism “a serious problem” at the school.
The vandalism also raised larger questions about diversity and inclusion at the Law School, prompting a group of students, Reclaim Harvard Law, to make a series of demands—which included hiring more diverse faculty—and stage extensive protests. Administrators later responded by pledging more diversity in hiring, retiring the school’s controversial seal, and launching a series of diversity-related initiatives.
Now, a year later, leaders of student affinity groups, including the Black Law Students Association, the Native American Law Students Association, and the Women’s Law Association, produced the commemorative exhibit, entitled “Diverse Voices in Legal Education.” It consists of black-and-white photographs displayed throughout Wasserstein Hall of diverse legal scholars from across the country. The presentation is intentionally reminiscent of the array of portraits that were vandalized last year.
“A year ago this week, after the portraits of our African-American faculty were defaced, members of this community responded with expressions of love and rejection of hatred,” Minow wrote in an email to Law School affiliates Tuesday. “We have had critically important conversations, increasing our sense of understanding and leading to change here at Harvard Law School. These conversations must continue, and you all can help.”
Black Law Students Association President Kristin A. Turner said she and other affinity group leaders came together earlier this fall to brainstorm ways to highlight the anniversary of the incident and ensure that discussions about diversifying the faculty continue at the school.
“We wanted to make sure that we were not only flagging the date itself but we were also shedding more light and bringing issues back to the forefront that are ongoing conversations at the Law School,” Turner said.
Law School Dean of Students Marcia L. Sells, whose office provided resources to students to help install the exhibit, called it “a wonderful coming together of the Student Government and student organizations.”
Turner and other student leaders decided to feature minority faculty from law schools nationwide to emphasize what they say is the disproportionately small number of minorities who work in legal education. In an article in the Harvard Law Record announcing the exhibit, affinity group leaders point to statistics indicating that 37 percent of law professors nationwide are women, and 15 percent are people of color.
But law professors of diverse backgrounds stand at the forefront of their fields, Turner said, and the display in Wasserstein Hall aims to showcase these scholars and prompt viewers to visualize a representative faculty in the school’s halls.
“We call it a visual campaign, because we wanted to do something that would tie to the portrait defacement,” she said. “We wanted people to walk down the halls and feel a sense of what it would be like to walk down halls with more diverse faculty members than the ones we currently walk through.”
In a statement to The Crimson last May, Minow wrote that the school was working on “recruitment and support of new and diverse staff and faculty.” A Law School spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about faculty diversity at the school.
The exhibit will run until Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Suppose you are a piñata.
One year you show up at a birthday party. Let’s say it’s a group of eight-year-old kids, all hyped on sugar. They grab a yellow Wiffle ball bat and beat the Skittles out of you. Your paper tears off, your cardboard splits open, and you fall to the mud. Excruciating pain.
Suppose you show up the next year. And the year after that. And the year after. In fact, let’s suppose that you show up for nine straight birthday parties, all the way up to age 16.
By this point you’re disheartened and physically deformed. Almond Joys stick out of your rib cage. Even so, you sit down and convince yourself that tradition is tradition. So you show up for a 10th time.
Who’s to blame for the ensuing violence, the birthday boy—now age 17—or the delusional piñata? Who’s the victim, and who’s the perpetrator? How much longer can these piñata parties go on?
On Saturday Harvard football plays Yale for the 133rd time in the history of The Game. The last time the Bulldogs won, Netflix didn’t exist as a streaming service. Which meant that there truly was no escape from New Haven.
Yet this weekend brings more than The Game. Let’s get serious for a moment: The Ivy League title is on the line. Penn, Princeton and Harvard all have a single loss, which means that a win ensures each of them a share of the title.
Conceivably, if scoring lines hold, three teams could share the crown for the second straight league. That’s 37.5 percent of the league. Ludicrous. Roughly the same as the amount of the nation that thought the Electoral College was the thing that made lights come on.
Speaking of elections, yikes. Some said that the Cubs could only win the World Series after the apocalypse. It turns out those people were wrong—they had the order reversed.
It is within the realm of possibility that Dartmouth will beat the Tigers or Yale will beat the Crimson? Possible, but Rakesh-does-a-keg-stand unlikely.
Meanwhile it’s not possible that Cornell beats the Quakers because, first, wide receiver Justin Watson is a character from Terminator and, two, Ithaca. More on that later.
COLUMBIA AT BROWN
Some professors specialize in astrophysics, others in pre-modern linguistics. Professor Michael Stein specializes in the effects of weed usage. And you wonder how you get tenure at Brown.
Recently Stein researched the effects of marijuana use on sleep and found a serious depreciation in rest quality. He surveyed 98 participants with a mean age of 22, including a cohort of daily smokers, occasional smokers, and non-smokers (also known as visiting students). The results seem robust, but university officials have questioned a $2,000 tab for Domino’s pizza.
Note to libel-checking editors: That number is a joke.
Why do I digress about the course of scientific progress? First, because this column exists to provide an education for our readers. Second, because Stein’s research encapsulates two key facts about this week’s Brown-Columbia matchup: The game will be a snorer, and you’d be better off rolling some J’s.
The Columbia defense is fearsome, and coach Al Bagnoli coaches with the fury of a man who has been forced to coach the Lions.
And Brown? If Stein’s conclusions prove correct, then the Bears will be sleep-deprived.
Score: Columbia 26, Brown 13.
DARTMOUTH AT PRINCETON
The matchup between the Big Green and the Tigers gives me another occasion to name-drop Domino’s. The pizza chain recently arrived in the wilderness of Hanover. Well, not actually Hanover but the nearby locales of West Lebanon and Claremont.
Not everyone is thrilled, though. The hometown chain Everything but Anchovies has argued that the cheap speed of Domino’s can’t compete with the slow quality of hand-crafted meals.
What Domino’s is to Everything but Anchovies, the Tigers are to the Big Green. One is an efficient machine, well oiled and flush with cash (hello online ordering and Princeton endowment). The other is a quaint vestige from the 1950s, enigmatic and possibly imaginary. Kind of like Robert Ruffins.
Ever since losing to the Crimson, the Tigers have devoured opponents whole. Princeton shut out Penn, 28-0, and downed Yale, 31-3.
A similar outcome will befall the Big Green this weekend. Mom-and-pop shops just can’t thrive in modern capitalism. Sorry.
Score: Princeton 38, Dartmouth 7.
PENN AT CORNELL
O Ithaca—muse of all columns, source of all jokes. Friend to anyone with writer’s block, foe to anyone who likes happiness. You have been a gift to The Crimson Sports Board.
In honor of this illustrious city, we should take a tour through history. Early modern Ithaca was a hub for salt trading. By the late 19th century, the town housed several national business, including the Ithaca Gun Company and the factory responsible for the Ithaca Kitty, a stuffed animal that allegedly enjoyed mass popularity before World War II.
Then the 20th century began. In 1902 a typhoid epidemic rocked the city. Years later, officials discovered that the Ithaca Gun Company had been testing shotguns in a tributary of the Cayuga Lake, contaminating a great deal of water. Clouds gathered above Ithaca, and they never receded.
Penn visits Cornell on Saturday, which would be a depressing trip except for the fact that the Quakers can claim a league championship with a win. It’s a classic moral dilemma—to earn that trophy that you’ve been working for all year or to forfeit and avoid a many-hour bus ride into the middle of nowhere.
As long as Penn coach Ray Priore can get his squad on the road, the Quakers will clean up Ithaca like the Ten Man after the men’s lacrosse team came through for a party.
Score: Penn 42, Cornell 13.
YALE AT HARVARD
If you’ve spent hundreds of dollars to buy N. Gregory Mankiw’s most recent magnum opus, then you know this basic economic fact: Supply and demand determine market equilibrium. If people value something less, then they will either buy fewer units, pay a lower price, or both.
How does this economic theory square with the behavior of Yale students? On the first day of sales, more than 2,400 kids paid 25 dollars to claim a ticket. Despite the fact that the Bulldogs are 2-7. Despite the fact that Yale has lost nine straight times in The Game.
Ah, but there is an incentive hiding in the background: This year Harvard plays the Bulldogs in Cambridge, Mass. Spend 25 dollars and flee New Haven for a few hours? Suddenly that list price sounds like a bargain.
Indeed, Orkin Pest Control recently named New Haven on a list called “50 Rattiest Cities.” In terms of rodent infestation, the city ranks No. 17 in the nation—which marks the first time that New Haven has been ranked No. 17, ever.
However, we should not underestimate Yale. That sounds insane, I know. But don’t count out a team that possesses great athletic talent, a season’s worth of frustration, and rodent-like hunger.
Piñatas traditionally don’t survive birthday parties. Odds are that the Bulldogs won’t survive Saturday either. However, I suspect that the early score will be closer than Harvard fans want to admit.
That said, all piñatas break at some point in time. That is why piñatas exist, actually. Make sure to bring a plastic bag to collect all those errant Milk Duds.
Score: Harvard 31, Yale 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

If Thursday night was any indication, one of Harvard’s biggest question marks may end up being one of its strengths this season. Wings Justin Bassey, Corey Johnson, and Seth Towns combined for 37 points to lift the Crimson to a 78-51 victory over Fisher College (1-1). Harvard (1-1) was able to empty its bench in the team’s regular season home opener.
“I was really, really thrilled with how our young kids were able to respond with starting and producing,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[Bassey’s] all-around play was sensational. I was very pleased with how he took advantage of an opportunity and that’s something for us going forward.”
Two key revelations were brought to the fore during the game’s player introductions. The first was that co-captain Siyani Chambers was in street clothes after a hard fall in the team’s season opener against Stanford. However, he is expected to return to practice as early as tomorrow. The second was that the visiting Falcons did not have a starter taller than 6’5”. Despite not having its starting point guard, Harvard was able to jump out to a comfortable lead and use its size advantage to put Fisher away before intermission.
The Crimson’s depth and size were on display from the opening tip. Amaker started four freshmen and co-captain Corbin Miller. First-year Chris Lewis was the only holdover from the starting lineup Amaker employed against Stanford. The group struggled to establish itself early on the offensive end but led by three at the game’s second media timeout and never looked back.
The Falcons’ undersized lineup worked to squeeze Harvard’s big men inside, but the starting frontcourt of Lewis and fellow freshman Henry Welsh succeeded in finding teammates for open shots on the wings. The Crimson shot 44 percent from the field in the first half and converted on eight three-pointers. Blockmates Johnson and point guard Tommy McCarthy led the trey parade before the break, combining for five triples. While the sophomores did their work from outside, Towns showed his versatile scoring arsenal. The freshman went into the locker room with 11 points, three coming from the foul line, six from three-point land, and two from an emphatic throwdown of a McCarthy lob pass. McCarthy looked comfortable running the offense in a game in which freshman point guard Bryce Aiken struggled shooting the ball.
On the defensive end, Harvard utilized its size advantage to limit Fisher’s opportunities and alter the guests’ shots. The Falcons managed to corral just two offensive rebounds and went into the break with 19 points to their credit. The Crimson held Fisher to 28 percent shooting from the field.
“We defended the ball way better in the first half than we did in the second half,” Johnson said. “We were containing and making them take tough shots, we were helpside defensive rebounding.”
The second half belonged to Bassey. A 6’5” wing from Denver, often overlooked in Harvard’s loaded recruited class, did not see the floor in Saturday’s clash with the Cardinal. However, he did not disappoint when inserted into the starting lineup on Thursday. After a quiet first half, Bassey set the tone after the break, scoring 14 points, more than any player had the entire game, in 12 second half minutes. He hit two threes and was a steady hand in a Crimson rotation that featured 19 different players getting time.
“Having this many guys, we have so many pieces to our team,” Johnson said. “So many guys bring different things to the table. The big thing for us is we don’t care who has the big night, who scores, we’re a team. Tonight, Bassey came and started his first college game and just destroyed it out there. He did a great job.”
Despite trailing by 22 at the intermission, the Falcons made some headway in the game’s second frame. The Harvard lead grew to 28 but an 8-0 run early in the half gave the visiting student section something to cheer about. Threes that were not falling in the first half began finding the bottom of the net and Fisher had an easier time getting into the heart of the Crimson defense. Seniors Kyle Holmes and Cooper Neal combined for 20 points and each Falcon starter hit a three. Despite a 50 percent mark from beyond the arc in the second half, Fisher only converted three other field goals down the stretch.
Harvard’s deep rotation was able to ensure that the Falcons never got closer than 20. Junior guard Andre Chatfield picked off a Fisher pass and took it the length of the floor for a two-handed dunk while senior Matt Fraschilla ran the point for the game’s final five minutes.
“I think it’s great,” Amaker said. “You’re not going to have opportunities like that every night and so for us to be in a position to do that, I was pleased to be able to do it and I know our kids appreciated it as well.”
