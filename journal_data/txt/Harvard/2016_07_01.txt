"Navigation only works from your current location."
This was easily the most useless feature an offline map could have. Standing in a busy Kyoto subway corridor quite far from my "current location" and "home," I was the most lost I've ever been. The charts on the walls were artistic masterpieces of numbers and patterned lines with incomprehensible Kanji. Google maps was impossible without wifi. But ten people, an umbrella, and two neighbors later, I made it home. 

As a culture, Japan is renowned for its politeness. The words “sorry” and “thank you” can get you through half of your interactions, and the endless possible layers for polite speech are what make Japanese one of the most difficult languages in the world. But Japan is far more generous than courteous.
Determined to find matcha ice cream parfaits, a friend asked a random store worker where to find the right cafe. Rather than say “I don’t know” or give brief directions, the worker went through a catalog of the neighborhood’s stores and, after finding a match, ditched her post and personally led us there.

This has been my everyday experience here. Each person I’ve met has tried to actively understand the situation I am in (awful Japanese included) and guessed the greater desperation behind my simple requests. From a scientific standpoint, this is perhaps unsurprising given Japan’s commitment to context sensitivity. A series of studies have ingeniously measured a culture’s sensitivity through characteristics of artwork. Japanese paintings, even ones by contemporary artists, have higher horizons that allow more information to surround and contextualize subjects. Meanwhile, Western paintings prefer singular, focused perspectives that are aesthetically realistic but contextually limited.
This tendency to adopt a bird’s eye view is not just an artistic phenomenon, however. It is a trait that is cultivated carefully by society’s rules. What East Asia’s cultures have in common is an unwillingness to state things directly, whether this be out of courtesy or more political motives. In South Korea, adherence to norms of hierarchy even resulted in a series of airplane crashes in the 1990s. Given these realities, it should be unsurprising that the ability to carefully guess and piece together context is a fundamental social skill.
While these norms can be difficult and sometimes inconvenient, they are invaluable for creating empathy. In America, empathy is not preached as a necessary basis for kindness. We instead worship surface generosity. But generosity defines the situation in terms of the giver—it is about your resources, your morals, your ability to impact the world. The receiver is reduced to one or two abstract needs. Beyond what’s relevant, they are an ignorable abstract.
But while generosity will make you share your umbrella with the stranger walking next to you, it will not motivate you to gift your family's second umbrella to someone who is quietly searching through her bag in a corner. Generosity will give you the patience to explain directions to a foreigner, but it won't inspire you to ditch your route of travel during rush hour and accompany her five blocks away, even though she tentatively says she understands your directions. 

However wonderfully analytical, generosity is simplifying and unintelligent. Needs are the products of situation, not isolated independents. An unwillingness to expend basic cognitive effort can only result in taking too many things at face value. We become resentful because we do not see others as full beings in a busy world of which we are only a part. We become mad at the waiter for his slowness, not stopping to consider the number of staff or the difficulty of the orders given by other tables. We do not realize that there is more to massive waves of illegal immigration than a desire for prosperity—there is domestic abuse, gang violence, and starvation.
Our simplification allows us to interpret situations in black and white, despite Western art’s love for color and multi-dimensionality. And when it comes to kindness, we see far less need and far more blame. This is not to say that Americans are bad or that the Japanese are infallible. This is only to say that details do matter. And that a little bit of common sense empathy could revolutionize not only the way we make offline maps, but also our own, complicated societies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 1, 2016, at 10:00 a.m.
For Harvard students seeking a career at Goldman Sachs, the Office of Career Services’ On-Campus Interview program has long been the pathway to follow. But now that path is being cut, with Goldman Sachs taking the process in-house and online.
Starting Friday, undergraduates seeking a summer analyst or full-time position at the renowned investment bank will go through a revamped interview process, according to Leslie Shribman, the company’s vice president of media relations.
After evaluating written applications submitted online, Goldman Sachs will ask select applicants to participate in pre-recorded video interviews. If the company is still interested in the candidate, the candidate will then be invited to a physical interview.
In addition, Goldman Sachs is making significant changes to the content of their interview questions, which Shribman said will follow “a more structured format going forward.”
“Questions will assess a standardized set of characteristics to increase consistency in the evaluation process and help us make more data-driven decisions in our hiring,” Shribman wrote in an email.
Furthermore, applications for both summer and full-time positions will be reviewed on a “rolling basis” throughout the remainder of the summer and school year, Shribman wrote.
“The flexible timeline gives students the option to start the application process when they are ready,” Shribman wrote in an email. “Students can interview whenever and wherever they would like, without disrupting their school day.”
The change in recruitment policy may have been a decision made to help lower attrition rates among entry-level hires—a problem Wall Street firms have been grappling with in recent years. In 2015, the average tenure for junior bankers at a dozen major banks was just under 18 months, down from a more than two-and-a-half year average tenure in 1996, according to the Wall Street Journal.
This data reflects a generational trend of lower workplace loyalty, according to Deborah A. Carroll, associate director of employer relations at OCS.
Goldman also expects the change to draw a larger field of applicants this year.
“We are always looking for ways to broaden our reach to applicants while increasing efficiency for our candidates and businesses,” Shribman wrote. “Shifting from on-campus interviews to pre-recorded video interviewing significantly increases the number of applicants we’re able to invite to the interview process.”
According to Carroll, the switch to a video interview is not without precedent. Particularly with companies based on the west coast like Amazon, video interviews have become common because of the challenges—both for employers and students—in traveling far distances.
As such, OCS has equipped itself in recent years with resources to support students going through new recruitment processes. An online tool dubbed “InterviewStream” allows students to submit pre-recorded videos to advisers at OCS, who can then review the submissions and offer critique. A similar tool called HireVue will be used to submit video interviews to Goldman Sachs, according to Shribman.
Before the change, Goldman Sachs had long been among a number of banks who participate in Harvard’s On-Campus Interview program. The program connects students with employers, and allows companies to send representatives to the College to conduct initial interviews with prospective candidates.
The process exists to help facilitate what can be a strenuous process. Banks and other companies that participate in the program agree to OCS guidelines that seek to protect students from aggressive hiring practices and interference to their academic schedules.
This past year, however, some firms circumvented the On-Campus Interview program and moved application deadlines earlier in the year, creating logistical challenges for students.
Currently, 20 percent of undergraduate students participate in the On-Campus Interview program, according to Carroll.

Earlier this month, Harvard College Admissions and Financial Aid brought their communications game to a whole new level. Forget Facebook. Forget Twitter. Forget Instagram. Meet DiscoverHarvard, the College’s recently announced Snapchat handle, and surely its trendiest social media ventures to date. 
Featuring Snaps from different student coordinators each day, the account provides a refreshingly personal and interactive view of campus life. Posts include everything from a video of dining hall food captioned “eat ur veggies” to a Snapsterpiece (a “Snapchat masterpiece” for the uninitiated) announcing an upcoming Q&A session in which questions can be submitted via Snapchat’s messaging feature and will be answered in videos. 
The account aims to give prospective students a sneak peek of Harvard life, but we like to think DiscoverHarvard does not appeal exclusively to future students. It is summer after all, meaning many of us are currently not at school ourselves. Feeling a little homesick for Harvard? Don’t be embarrassed, just quietly add DiscoverHarvard and you can easily get your daily fix of student life in Cambridge.
According to the digital communications team behind DiscoverHarvard, Snaps from the account are getting over 2,000 views (no pressure to the students featured on the account). Regardless, given our undoubted enthusiasm about both Harvard and Snapchat, we’re sure DiscoverHarvard will be on our best friends list in no time.

For years, Harvard students have clung to Annenberg Hall as their connection to the wizarding world of Harry Potter (if by some chance you haven’t already noticed, the freshman dining hall closely resembles Hogwarts’ Great Hall in the Potter movies). 
However, if your fierce desire to attend a wizarding school is still unsatisfied (or if you just really can’t wait for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child to come out on July 31), have no fear. A few days ago, J.K. Rowling published new content on Pottermore.com revealing that a wizarding school is located in Massachusetts.
Established in the seventeenth century, Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry boasts its own four houses, traditions, and a reputation of being the least elitist of the wizarding schools. Rowling writes that Ilvermorny sits atop Massachusetts’ highest peak: Mount Greylock, just a few hours west of Harvard.
The textbook-style account of Ilvermorny’s history on Pottermore.com gives in-depth details about how the school came to be. According to Rowling, Ilvermorny’s Irish founder—an orphaned witch by the name of Isolt Sayre—was kidnapped as a child by her evil aunt, Gormlaith Gaunt (yes, that’s Gaunt as in the descendants of Salazar Slytherin).
Isolt was told all about Hogwarts as she grew up, but her aunt did not allow her to attend the school even when she received her letter. Rowling writes, “Hogwarts sounded like a kind of paradise and [Isolt] spent much of her teens fantasising about it.” Us too, Isolt, us too.
Eventually, Isolt escaped to North America—via the Mayflower, of course. Once arriving in the New World, she quickly set out on her own, sensing that she might not be too welcomed among so-called “No-Majs” (that’s the American term for Muggle). Isolt ultimately created Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry—not before several encounters with magical creatures, some experimental wand-making, and a dramatic duel.
Before you get too excited, Rowling did not specify whether Ilvermorny accepts college-age transfer students, but maybe they’re up for a neighborly game of quidditch?
