The Undergraduate Council is helping Harvard celebrate its birthday in style. This year the UC held a contest for the shirt design that would best represent Harvard's 375th birthday.1,032 ballots were cast, according to the UC Election Commission Chair Nikko S.S. Tomata '13.
The winning shirt was designed by Bonnie O. Wong '13. According to UC President Senan Ebrahim '12, her design won in a landslide.
"Out of the ten designs it got 25-30% of the votes," Ebrahim said, "which is huge for 10 designs."
Wong's winning design features Lowell Bell-Tower and Widner Library, both iconic Harvard buildings.
"I was sitting in the sixth floor of Quincy when I was designing and turned to look out the windowthe sun was setting on the silhouette of Lowell Bell-Tower," Wong said.
Shirts will be distributed October 13 in Annenberg and the upperclassmen dining halls.

The Harvard women’s tennis team went bicoastal for the weekend.
While junior co-captains, Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana, headed west to compete as a doubles team at the Riviera/Intercollegiate Tennis Association All-American Championship in California, the remaining Crimson women traveled to Flushing Meadows, N.Y., last Friday for the USTA Billie Jean King Invitational.
The USTA tournament featured 156 collegiate players from across the country, including representatives from every Ivy League school except Penn. In this formidable field of competitors, Harvard wielded a strong performance. The Crimson women played in six different singles draws and three various doubles draws.
USTA BILLIE JEAN KING INVITATIONAL
Harvard sophomore Hannah Morrill won her first two matches in the A draw before Olga Makhova of Charleston Southern University defeated her in the round of 16.
Freshman Sylvia Li and junior Camille Jania were also standout players in the tournament.
Playing in the C singles draw, Li defeated her first two competitors in straight sets before facing a more challenging opponent: Princeton’s Katherine Flanigan, seeded third in her portion of the draw.
“I had played her before because we are both from California,” Li said. “I kind of knew what to expect, although her game has changed a bit in college. It was a tough match, and she played really well. We both fought very hard; her game and mine match up well. But this weekend, she had the advantage.”
Jania, seeded third in singles draw B, also had a strong showing.
“Every match was a learning experience,” Jania said. “Every time I went on the court, I just wanted to do better than in the last match and improve on something that I was struggling with. No matter what kind of point occurred, I wanted to have positive energy and move on to the next point.”
The junior won two straight matches to make it to the semifinals. She was then defeated by Columbia’s Bianca Sanon in a tough, three-set contest, 6-1, 5-7, 12-10.
“The first set was really decisive of who was the better player,” Jania said. “I was kind of doubting myself after it.”
After the first set, Jania and her coaches were able to analyze her opponent’s game and create opportunities for Jania to win points, allowing her to take the second.
“After analytically approaching the game, I was able to figure her out and hit better shots,” Jania said. “Then in the tie-break, it was close the entire way. She was always in it, never backing down. She was a tough opponent and drove me to step up my game every single time. I just came up a little bit short. She wanted it more than me today.”
Jania also excelled in doubles play, partnering with junior Alexandra Lehman. The duo made it to the semifinals of the B bracket, where they were defeated by Nadia Lee and Franziska Sprinkmeyer of Northern Texas University.
The team as a whole showed improvement and became a more cohesive unit.
“We had played a tournament earlier, and compared to that one, this one had a lot more chemistry in the doubles teams and a lot more team spirit throughout the whole tournament,” Li said. “There were some great matches this weekend, and everyone fought really hard.”
The team’s mental approach to the tournament was also a key element to its success.
“Everyone really put in an incredible amount of effort before and after each match,” Jania said. “The match actually begins before you even set foot on the court, and everyone did a great job of really preparing and having the right mentality. I was very impressed with how everyone approached the tournament.”
The tournament as a whole was an important opportunity and experience for the team.
“There were many great teams at the tournament and every match was pretty competitive,” Li said. “Everyone got to play a lot of matches, the facilities were great, and it was a lot of fun.”
In addition, the team, with a little help from technology, was able to stay connected with its two captains despite the distance.
“Our team felt a lot smaller, but we were still a team,” Li said. “Plus, we kept [Norton and Tachibana] updated through text messages.”
RIVIERA/ITA ALL-AMERICAN CHAMPIONSHIP
After a solid win over 12th-ranked Lauren Embree and Joanna Mather of Florida, Harvard doubles partners Norton and Tachibana advanced no further, losing to Clemson’s No. 1 Josipa Bek and Keri Wong in the second round, 8-2.
Yet, being the only unranked team going into the tournament, the Crimson tandem still harvested some positives after the loss.
“We went in with a nothing-to-lose mentality,” Norton said. “[After we saw the draw], we thought if we could beat [Embree and Mather], it would be a good sign for us in the Ivy League because we don’t get a chance to play against top-ranked teams that often. It was a good experience.”

When it rains, it pours. Just ask senior Jon Pearlman of the Harvard men’s tennis team.
This weekend at the ITA Men’s All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla., Pearlman dropped his fourth and fifth matches in a row in an inauspicious start to the fall season.
Ranked No. 78 in the ITA preseason polls, Pearlman was selected as one of the 48 competitors in the main draw and competed in a bracket of 64 players that included 42 players ranked within the top 50.
Up first for Pearlman in the main draw was sophomore Adrien Puget of UCLA on Thursday.
Puget took an early advantage by winning the first set, 6-2, and stormed to an early lead in the second set.
Pearlman fought back to 5-4, but Puget secured the final game of the match to move on to the second round of tournament. He then fell to sixth-seeded Dennis Nevolo out of Illinois.
Landing in the consolation bracket, Pearlman faced off against sophomore Malte Stropp of Mississippi State, ranked No. 46 in the nation.
Despite Pearlman’s efforts, he dropped the match in straight sets, 6-2, 6-3, to leave the Sooner State winless.
Stropp went on to win his second round match in three sets before falling in the quarters.
Pearlman is 0-5 so far in the preseason but has faced players in the top 50 in all five matches. In the Harvard Fall Chowder Fest two weekends ago, Pearlman lost to No. 16 Daniel Nguyen of USC, No. 42 Alexis Klegou of Texas A&M and No. 8 Evan King of Michigan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Shawn Levy’s “Real Steel,” the only difference between the world of today and that of tomorrow is the prevalence of fighting robots. No, not the kind bent on world domination—boxing robots. These hulking humanoid machines fight each other for our entertainment, and apparently haven’t yet entered their Skynet phase. The film, which features Hugh Jackman, Evangeline Lilly, and a breakout performance by 12-year-old Dakota Goyo, coasts on its evocative imagery and atmosphere, which mostly compensate for its rather pedestrian plot.
“Real Steel” is based in a future where humans become bored with human-on-human fighting and decide that robot-on-robot mashing would be more exciting. Jackman plays Charlie Kenton, a washed-up human boxer with irresponsible impulses and a knack for losing money. His counterpart is Bailey Tallet (Lilly), the owner of a gym and Charlie’s foil. Where he is rash and mercurial, she is thoughtful and stable.
After Charlie fails to win a match against a 2,000-pound bull, he is summoned to court and informed that an old girlfriend has died, leaving their son in his custody. This son, Max Kenton (Dakota Goyo), proves to be a natural regarding all things robotic. After Charlie loses yet again, he and Max sneak into a junkyard and find Atom, a sparring bot who mirrors the actions of others and was originally employed for practice with other dueling bots. Max uses his father’s fighting skills to encode the “muscle” memory of the boxing techniques in Atom’s hard drive. Through this, Atom becomes a one-of-a-kind robot—one that fights like a human and has a distinctive personal connection to Max. As Atom battles his way to the top of the robot standings, Max and Charlie deepen their own relationship.
In spinning this tale, “Real Steel” offers a fresh take on future culture, but doesn’t take it far enough; essentially the only “futuristic” element of the film are its robots. But what a fantastic element it is—the movie’s mechanical sparring is spectacular. Former world boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard supervised the motion capture for the robotic fighting, and has a cameo in the movie. He also trained Jackman for his role in the film, and it shows.
Alongside the phenomenal fight scenes, viewers will also appreciate the acting skills of 12-year-old Dakota Goyo. His portrayal of Max feels more genuine than the performances of the more experienced actors surrounding him, and the young actor does a surprisingly good job of establishing a believable connection with a mute and emotionless robot.
In contrast to the compelling performance of its fledgling lead, the film’s script seems rather contrived. The writers, John Gatin, Dan Gilroy, and Jeremy Leven, first show Charlie continually berating and insulting his son only to have the two form an ostensibly loving relationship after Max finds his dad a winning robot. Jackman does little to help matters; his American accent switches frequently from twangy Texan to gravelly New Yorker, and his character is entirely lacking in charm, making the father-son bonding that much less credible. A redemption arc requires a redeemable protagonist.
The film’s premise, drawn from Richard Matheson’s short story “Steel,” is undeniably intriguing, and those looking for a visually arresting underdog story will appreciate this cinematic adaptation. There is something in it for everyone—a hillbilly rally, a state fair, an underground fight to the death, and an impressively high-profile bout in the “Bing” arena—all with robots! Perhaps most refreshingly, “Real Steel” is a movie where these robots do not fight back, take over humanity, or live alongside a decaying remnant of the human race. Instead, the movie’s machines are essentially hulking humanoid extensions of today’s video games, and simply serve as an outlet for entertainment—for both the film’s characters and its audience.
All in all, “Real Steel” has some serious flaws—the crux of the plot is basically a glorified Taebo workout, and its characters are largely forgettable—yet it still manages to retain audience interest. After all, who doesn’t like to see totally real-looking robots duking it out in stunning futuristic venues? It’s like the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), but with no rules and where it’s completely acceptable for a fighter to rip the other’s arm off.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In crafting “The Saddest Movie Ever Made,” there are several criteria a screenwriter must meet. In theory, “Restless” checks off every one of them: death-obsessed boy with departed parents; love interest who has terminal cancer; and terse dialogue like “love means never having to say you’re sorry.” However, in practice, Gus Van Sant’s newest film couples an inherently depressing set-up with quaint cinematography, quirky music, and antiquated costuming that instead makes “Restless” into “The Most Cognitively Dissonant Movie Ever Made.”
The film follows the psyche of Enoch Brae (Henry Hopper) as he lives in the wake of his parents’ untimely deaths. He attends random memorial services dressed as a sort of 19th-century poet, complete with coattails and a stiff, thick dress shirt. He has dropped out of school and chosen instead to throw rocks at passing trains or to play Battleship with his ghost friend/schizophrenic vision Hiroshi (Ryo Kase). Hopper plays Enoch as a defeated Holden Caulfield, the sort of boy who spites his aunt after his parents die en route to seeing her receive an award, and generally spurns a faithless world.
Enter boyish, brain-cancered Annabel Cotton (Mia Wasikowska), who gives no emotional indication that she has three months left to live. She discusses her upcoming death as simply as she discusses her obsession with Charles Darwin and water birds, and the two proceed to fence, trick-or-treat, climb trees, and traipse around graveyards in a myriad of vintage outfits appropriate to “The Great Gatsby.”
To be fair, the film itself is reliably beautiful, helped along by the attractiveness of the two main leads and their overstated presence. When the camera is not focused on Enoch or Annabel, it is making some commentary about the fleeting nature of life. The graveyards, forests, and suburban landscape all add to the idea of wanderlust and of searching for something in life that Annabel will soon not have in death. Admittedly, when the duo lies on asphalt, outlined by chalk as in a taped-off police scene, it is near impossible not to feel wistfully that the premature parting of two such aesthetically-pleasing people is a crime.
However, with a set-up crafted to tug heart-strings, it’s bizarre that there are almost no displays of sadness in “Restless.” Enoch desecrates his parents’ tomb out of anger at abandonment, accosts Annabel’s doctor, and often stomps out of his house petulantly, yet otherwise his face is more often than not completely blank. Annabel is a worse offender in this regard; she evinces the inexplicable sagacity of a much more mature personality in accepting her death. Enoch’s Japanese ghost Hiroshi, who serves as an embodiment of Enoch’s inner thought process, makes for effective comic relief—on handshakes versus bows, he opines “you white people always have to grab everything.” But when he is added to the production’s already overly cheery elements, the film takes on a bizarrely happy tone.
Further muddling the movie is Danny Elfman’s soundtrack, which feels completely out of place, as one might expect given the composer’s quirky modus operandi. The perky xylophone that pervades “Restless” seems as inappropriate as Enoch’s funeral-crashing. Worse still, many of the film’s poignant scenes that could potentially have served as counterweights to the movie’s happier moments are quickly swept aside by orchestral outbursts of rage or joy more suitable to a Broadway musical.
Ultimately, the combination of a tragic script, actors who are more convincing when happy than sad, a gorgeous cinematographic experience, and a disturbing insinuation that terminal illness can serve as the patron saint of any romance leaves viewers with a film as confused as its own leads. The most disappointing aspect of all, however, is that if Annabel did not have an illness, and she and Enoch were merely obsessed with death, the film would have been oddly brilliant. But instead, the movie’s meandering mood and tone undermine its authenticity and prevent “Restless” from being the commentary on life, death, and youth it wishes to be.

“The Way” chronicles the travels of retired doctor Tom Avery (Martin Sheen) as he hikes the European religious pilgrimage along which his son died. In the process, he meets many other hikers also burdened by life’s travails, and comes to a renewed appreciation of his late estranged son. At least, that was clearly writer-director Emilio Estevez’s plan. What actually transpires is a cinematic travelogue that is heavy on the scenery and moralizing but light on genuine characterization and plot.
The movie begins with the death of Tom’s son Daniel, played by Estevez, Sheen’s real-life son. Flashbacks reveal the dysfunctional relationship between the two; Daniel’s desire to “see the world” clashes with his traditionalist father’s desire for him to complete his schooling. When Daniel dies unexpectedly in Spain on the treacherous Way of St. James, a Catholic pilgrimage ending at Santiago de Compostela, his father flies to Europe and is compelled to complete the trek his son began. Tom dons his deceased son’s gear, straps his son’s cremated remains to his pack, and begins the pilgrimage. Many will probably cringe at the thought of a father wearing his dead son’s T-shirts, socks, and underwear on a month-long walk from France to the western edge of Spain, but evidently this did not strike the screenwriter as overly macabre.
As Tom sets out on the Way of St. James, the focus of the movie shifts radically from his attempt to find closure for his difficult relationship with his son to a pedantic glorification of Tom as the archetype of a bygone American gentleman. This didactic conceit plays out in different ways with each pilgrim Tom encounters on the trail, as the elderly doctor gallantly tolerates and sometimes guides his fellow travelers, but never learns much from them.
The first of these is Joost (Yorick van Wageningen), a Dutchman from Amsterdam who is constantly looking for the next party. Joost’s wildness and youth contrast with the older Tom’s more staid, regimented approach to life. While the two characters would seem to have much to teach each other, neither one ever achieves any greater understanding of why their counterpart acts the way he does. A better film might have had Joost helping Tom to empathize with his son’s heterodox desire to travel rather than go to school, and also shown Tom’s disciplined nature rubbing off on Joost, which gives him the wherewithal to lose weight and get his careening life back on track. Instead, like most of the inhabitants of “The Way,” Joost is an unrealized caricature rather than a genuine character.
The second traveler Tom encounters is Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger), a disillusioned and attractive 40-something. When they first meet, the embittered woman rails against the urbane Tom, condemning him for a variety of sins—from being a divorcé, to being the source of the current financial crisis, to owning an iPod. Tom takes this abuse from Sarah with romantic stoicism, and his good nature eventually leads to a melting of the ice between them. Sarah says she is traveling the Way of St. James to quit smoking, although she clearly has deeper reasons for taking the pilgrimage. However, her storyline proves frustratingly inconclusive—she doesn’t even manage to kick her smoking habit—and her character fails to relate to the death of Tom’s son in any serious way.
The final pilgrim in the film is Irish travel writer, Jack (James Nesbitt), who fills the niche of the resident crazed intellectual. When Jack learns of Daniel’s death from Tom, he takes Tom’s story as the perfect antidote for his writer’s block. The peripatetic travel author is obviously meant to serve as a stand-in for Daniel, and indeed, late in the film Tom suggests that Jack reminds him of his son. That throughout the movie, Jack is essentially gushing to Tom about the idea of using the plotline of “The Way” as the source material for a book feels just a touch self-congratulatory; like the character of Jack, the movie’s storyline is far too unidimensional to be deserving of any special notice.
In the end, while “The Way” has its share of funny moments and an abundance of beautiful scenery, it is wholly lacking when it comes to a cohesive plot. Characters meander on and off the screen without any real purpose, personal storylines are left hanging and unresolved, and Tom’s redemption quest suffers as a result of all of these flaws. Moreover, the script’s pandering pedagogy makes it hard even for an actor as estimable as Sheen to draw viewers in and have them identify with his character. Too often, the film seems to exploit the younger characters in its story to justify Tom’s arrogance and to praise the values of the older generation he supposedly represents. While this sort of sappy narrative may please the AARP crowd, most others are advised to steer clear.

If life gives you lemons, screenwriter Will Reiser has some advice for you: keep those lemons fermenting for seven years, make lemonade, and then hire Seth Rogen to sell it. Of course, for Reiser, these lemons came in the form of advanced spinal cancer. But with that premise, his sweet and sour movie “50/50” provides a platform for Rogen’s natural, stoner style of comic relief.
Together, years after their shared cigarette breaks at “Da Ali G Show” and joint cancer treatment in Vancouver—with Reiser as the patient and Rogen as the supportive friend—the two have collaborated again to create an authentic, light-hearted attempt at laughing despite cancer. “We’re not making fun of cancer,” Reiser says, “we’re making fun of the way that people deal with it, and the dysfunction it creates.” Toeing a thin line between comedy and melodrama, “50/50” combines poignancy and personal experience to demonstrate how these comedians confronted mortality—and conquered it with surgery, weed, and some therapeutic laughs.
While the film is not entirely based on real-life events, “50/50” is filled with on-point character development and sensory elements that only first-hand experience begets. “The movie is fiction,” Reiser explains, “but there’s still those emotions [that are] very true to how I felt.”
According to Rogen, these feelings were mutual. “If we hadn’t personally experienced this,” he says, “it would have been really hard to make this movie.”
In “50/50,” Reiser and Rogen portray an uncharacteristic treatment of cancer on the screen, and elicit laughs where one would normally find only tears. “It seemed like in every movie about [cancer], all the people do is sit around and dwell on it all day,” Rogen explains. “We thought it’d be interesting just to show a movie that felt like what we went through. It was really sad sometimes, but it was also really funny sometimes.”
“I was confronting my own mortality,” Reiser adds. “But we’re comedy writers. When we were 25, we would rarely sit around and talk about our feelings. We would just joke about it.”
And joke about it they have. Reiser imbues the script with hyper-personal details and reflections, while Rogen takes center stage on screen and seamlessly creates—or recreates—the character of himself, in the same best friend role that he “played” seven years ago.
“I just tried to be as natural and as real as possible,” Rogen says. “Honestly, sometimes your concern is more to create a character, and to sell a persona that isn’t yours. And that wasn’t really my goal with this.”
By juxtaposing their perspectives from their personal experiences with cancer, Reiser and Rogen generate a stereo perspective of sorts, conjuring two hours of entertainment that are far from two-dimensional. “[We] had a lot of creative input in [making] the film,” Reiser says, “It became a much more collaborative effort.” This creative control allowed both writer and actor to inject realistic, unforced transitions of emotion into the film that sprung from their own stories.
“There are some sequences [that], literally at the drop of a hat, go from being really funny to really dark,” Rogen says. “I was surprised at how quickly we could make those transitions back and forth.”
“I based it on what my own emotional trajectory was, and just what felt honest to the character in the movie,” Reiser adds. “It naturally came that way.”
Being able to write such an honest movie about his struggle has been a healing experience for Reiser. “Back then, I had to deal with a lot of dysfunction in my life,” he says. “Part of it was due to my inability to talk about it ... We never sat around and talked about what my feelings were or how painful it was at times. I think being able to write about it and process it all ... really enabled me to get it out of my system.”
From this perspective, Reiser’s “50/50” is a final catharsis of sorts, a supplement to his already long process of recovery. “There’s this tendency, when you go through a situation like that, you just want to run away, you want to avoid thinking about it,” he says. “After my surgery and rehab, I just wanted to get back to my normal life. Actually having to sit down and write this movie, I found there was just so much that I wanted to get out, and I wanted to say.”
“There are millions of people who get sick who don’t become miserable assholes,” Rogen adds. “And that’s what we wanted to portray.”
With “50/50,” Reiser and Rogen effectively channel these personal sentiments and emotions into what may be regarded as the new, sixth stage of grief: producing a cathartic feature film of pure authenticity, with personal stakes and no gimmicks—an all-natural approach to cancer’s funny, more human side.

It was a long drive back from Ithaca for the Harvard men’s soccer team Saturday night.
Although the Crimson (2-7-1, 0-2-0 Ivy) entered the second half with the 1-0 advantage over Cornell (6-1-3, 2-0-0), the Big Red needed only 15 minutes to notch three consecutive goals, taking back the lead to come away with a 3-1 victory.
“The result was a little bit disappointing,” co-captain Tim Linden said. “We performed well for parts of the game and really underperformed for parts of the game. We can’t fault anybody for effort, but it comes down to being sharp mentally and physically and taking care of the job, which we weren’t able to do for 90 minutes.”
Cornell came out strong, getting several early shots off, but Harvard settled down to post a strong first-half performance. The Crimson shut down the Big Red offense and tested Cornell in its defensive third. In the first 20 minutes, Big Red junior goalkeeper Rick Pflasterer kept the visitors out of the net with two saves, stopping a long free kick by sophomore defender Eric Slingerland and a header attempt by junior forward Brian Rogers. Defenders junior Richard Smith and Linden then followed up with two promising looks on goal, but both shots flew wide.
Harvard’s offense capitalized on its offensive momentum after 32 minutes of play. Sophomore defender Ross Friedman curled a free kick from outside the penalty box onto the six-yard line, where sophomore defender Oblajulu Agha finished the opportunity to put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
Cornell recorded two more shots on goal before the end of the half, but senior goalkeeper Austin Harms stopped both to maintain Harvard’s lead.
“We entered into half time with a lot of confidence,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “We thought we had done well and had executed our game plan.”
But after the first 15 minutes of the second half, the memory of such performance had disappeared. The Big Red targeted the center of the Harvard defense, capitalizing on breakdowns to put the ball away.
Cornell’s first goal came off a breakaway less than three minutes into the period, when senior midfielder Jimmy Lannon found sophomore forward Daniel Haber streaking down the left side, who then slotted the ball into the right corner of the goal past Harms.
Less than three minutes later, Haber sent a long volley down the right side to senior forward Chase Aaronson, who chipped the ball over Harms from 30 yards out to reclaim the lead for the Big Red. Another Cornell goal quickly followed, when a passing play between junior forward Tyler Regan and freshman midfielder Conor Goepel beat the Crimson defense, giving Goepel time to place the ball into the back of the net.
“People were a little bit shocked [when the Big Red scored the equalizer] just because for much of the game, we had the better run of it up until that point,” Linden said. “We definitely knew we were still in it, but it seemed to fall apart a few minutes after that. I think guys were looking around for answers and really weren’t able to find anything.”
Harvard outshot the Big Red, 6-5, in the second period, but despite its best efforts, the Crimson was unable to finish, and the deficit became too large to overcome. With the victory, Cornell extended its unbeaten streak to nine games and sent Harvard back to Cambridge with its second Ivy loss.
“It is harder to attack the other team’s goal when you have defensive liabilities,” Junot said. “You commit more to defending at that point, and it’s harder to advance your team up the field. I think that accounted for a lot of us not attacking in the second half, because we were a little bit less secure with out defending.
“[Going forward,] I’m of the opinion that if we shore up our defense, we will actually become a better attacking team. There are less liabilities in the back, and you can commit more chances in the attack.”
The Big Red outshot the Crimson, 13-11, for the game, with 7-3 on net, while Harvard led in corner kicks, 4-2. Harms recorded four saves for the match.
“If I look at the game as a whole, it was probably 75 minutes of a decent performance from our team,” Junot said. “There were just those 15 minutes where, for whatever reason, we couldn’t figure out the center of our defense. Credit [goes to] Cornell, who was very good with [targeting] it.”

At first glance, black ink scribbles, a crocheted wire sculpture, and a woman dancing do not seem to have much in common. However, the exhibition “Dance/Draw,” on view at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) from October 7 to January 16, seeks to find these connections and illuminate the common ground between visual art and dance.
The ICA’s chief curator, Helen Molesworth, attributes inspiration for the exhibit to Trisha Brown’s innovative art. Brown, best known as a choreographer, also makes drawings using charcoal held with her toes while essentially dancing on paper. Molesworth finds Brown’s work fascinating in two ways. “[It is both] an afterlife of dance and ... a record of how the dancer moves,” she says. In “Dance/Draw” she uses a variety of pieces that are hard to place in any one genre to explore the link between performance and visual art. “Dance and art are connected by a mutual interest in the line,” says Molesworth. Starting with the line, she explores the link between dance, drawing, and other forms of genre-bending art that employ elements of both forms.
The show is divided into four sections, which Molesworth compares to a collection of interrelated short stories. “I was surprised at how cohesive it feels as a viewer walking through. A lot of times with these survey shows you get too many different practices thrown at you, but I think this was really well done,” says Sara J. Stern ’12, a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator who attended the opening of the show. The first room, titled “More Than Just The Hand,” explores nontraditional forms of drawing. It includes works like Janine Antoni’s “Butterfly Kisses,” made from the artist batting her mascara coated eyelashes on paper; part of Daniel Ranalli’s “Snail Drawings Series”—not drawings but photos of snails first arranged intentionally in the sand and then dispersed of their own accord; and Brown’s and composer John Cage’s visual works. ”Drawing can be a window into what the artist is doing with their time,” says Molesworth, who selected art that reveals the action that created it.
The second section, entitled “The Line in Space,” incorporates more sculptural pieces like Ruth Asawa’s crocheted hanging wire sculptures and Howardena Pindell’s canvas grid sagging under the force of gravity and spreading from the wall onto the floor. Here the line breaks out of the two-dimensional as it ventures towards movement. The movement begins in the next section, “Dancing,” which presents many video portrayals of dance and movement, photographs of dancing or choreographed moments, and “Floor of the Forest,” Trisha Brown’s dance-sculpture. Also featured in the section are Lucinda Childs and Yvonne Rainer, who along with Trisha Brown were members of the Judson Dance Theater. This group from the ’60s experimented with ideas of dance composition and improvisation and were crucial to the creation of postmodern dance. The exhibit concludes with “Drawing,” a display of visual art pieces that are in some way inspired by dance or incorporate ideas of movement. It includes contemporary figure drawings by a group called the Friends of the Fine Arts and a photo series called “Ballad to Ballet” by Robin Rhode of a hand interacting with a compass.
However, “Dance/Draw” is more than just a gallery show; it includes a series of performances in the ICA’s theater, as well as in the gallery itself in Trisha Brown’s “Floor of the Forest.” Her sculpture is to be ‘animated’ three days a week, three times day, by dancers from Brown’s company who climb on the sculpture and interact with it. The performance element adds energy to the show. “That’s something that can get lost in a gallery, you can miss out on the energy that a live performance can initiate,” says Stern.
As an exhibit, “Dance/Draw” tells the story of the transition of the line—from the page in visual art to the human body in dance—but it also tells the story of the way this interaction between visual and performing arts has been understood over time and around the world. “It’s really great to be a part of a show that is attempting to historicize in such a broad and important way,” says Jesse A. Green ’02, whose video work “Ärztliche Zimmergymnastik” is presented in the third section of the show. His hopes for his piece and the show are echoed in his views about art itself. “[Art should] get people to look more closely and think about subject matter that is not in front of them every day, to open up new ideas about how the visual works.” In showcasing art that eliminates the line between performance and visual art forms, “Dance/Draw” seeks to do just that.

Throughout “Autism Speaks and Sings: The Power of Music Therapy in the World of Autism”—an informative showcase of the different available music therapies for autistic children—a collection of songs were played with exuberance. Children eagerly listened and clapped their hands in coordination as they followed the singers’ hand gestures. The young and old alike were drawn into a world of imaginative lyrics about giraffes, panda bears, whales, and dance. “It’s just amazing to see how music can touch children and adults, and how it can heal and make a difference in people’s lives in so many different ways,” said Marcia E. Humpal, former vice-president of American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) and current co-chair of AMTA’s Autism Strategic Priority Workgroup.
“Autism Speaks”—held this past Wednesday at the Berklee College of Music David Friend Recital Hall—was led by national experts Humpal and Doctor Darcy D. Walworth, director of music therapy at the University of Louisville. The show sought to create awareness of the ways in which music therapy benefits children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) through a unique combination of education and performance.
ASD, according to Harvard Medical School Professor Dr. Martha R. Herbert, is a condition that displays some but not all of the characteristics of autism. “Individuals with autism display abnormalities in communication, social interaction, and behavior,” she says. “In the case of ASD, the person may not meet all the strict behavioral criteria developed through extensive research, but displays some of the features.” From a neuroscientific perspective, she elaborates on how music therapy can benefit a child with autism. “Brain cells ... need to follow [a regular] rhythm to produce a response in the brain. For people with autism, there is less coordination of this rhythm from one point to another. Music helps by creating an organized and regular stimulus to the brain that helps the brain get organized to keep track of the rhythm.”
Music therapy itself is rather individualized and focuses on the child’s past experiences and background with music, and thus there is a wide variety of music that can be therapeutic. “It can be any kind of music because every individual has a different preference,” says Humpal. “We try to use music that appeals to the individual person. For example, for teenagers, we won’t be using Rock and Roll from the ’50s but rather a lot of the current hits that really capture their attention.” Walworth, who further draws a distinction between the quality and structure of music, concurs. “From a musician’s perspective, the music quality matters a lot. Is it classical? Is it jazz? Is it stimulating? Is it peaceful? But from a music therapist’s perspective, it is the structure of the music and the application of it that engages the child. So the child’s past experience with music matters.”
The wide variety of music showcased is a clear testament to the range of music available for all children with different degrees of ASD. Music played included traditional children’s songs such as “Old MacDonald” as well as modern pop songs with altered lyrics. Justin Bieber’s “Baby” was used to practice the pronunciation of consonants and vowels, and Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” was used to help find a channel for emotional expression. The instruments included the guitar, piano, and drums, while the songs ranged from engaging and familiar—like the “Hokey Pokey”—to soothing and original. Roxanne Curzi, mother of seven-year-old Evan who has been diagnosed with autism, had a positive reaction to the show. “I think it’s really nice,” she says. “My son has a really hard time with attention and he was pretty attentive the whole time.”
There is still much left to be discovered in music therapy for children with autism. Currently, Walworth is working towards developing an evidence-based approach, which entails documenting the outcomes and protocols that have proven to be more effective. While music therapy has been classified as an emerging discipline—a category containing fields that have shown a degree of effectiveness in current research studies but have not yet qualified as full-fledged disciplines—researchers still face problems with funding and future direction. “Autism Speaks and Sings” not only interactively engaged both children and their families, but also raised awareness about the future possibilities of alternative therapies available for children with ASD.

In recent years art conservation has emerged as a fast-growing industry. Graduate schools across the country now offer programs in the field. Without conservation work, we would not be able to enjoy masterpieces like Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel, the pyramids in Egypt, or many of the beautiful buildings right here in Boston. But something about altering the works we hold most precious for the sake of preventing future alteration seems counterintuitive.
Not long ago I was watching a museum’s educational video on their conservation methods when the image of a man happily layering new paint atop an ancient masterpiece as he spoke casually with the film team made me cringe.
As a whole, it seems that the international museum community has deemed conservation a worthy, even principal, goal. Voices of dissent make arguments that focus on staying true to the methods and materials originally used by the artist, but no one questions the fundamental philosophy behind such work. Realistically, I admit that this is a practical stance to take, not least because “anti-conservationist” is a far from positive, desirable label. But there’s something to be said for the opposite argument—for letting nature run its course, even on art. Whether this makes me “anti-conservationist” or not I leave to the reader to decide.
I would argue that what we are really doing when we decide to restore a work of art is refusing to acknowledge the inalterable passage of time. We seek to encapsulate what works of art we deem worthy in airless, isolated bubbles, all for the sake of preserving them for the future. This is the very essence of the modern museum; the blank sterility of so many of our art galleries proves that we sometimes preserve art to the point that it becomes harder to appreciate it.
For example, the prehistoric cave paintings in Lascaux have long been closed to the public due to concerns about the acceleration of their deterioration. Like an expensive shirt that remains hanging in the closet because a worthy situation never arises, this kind of “preserved” art forces us to ask ourselves what we are waiting for. As we plan for a vaguely conceptualized, indefinite future, we deny ourselves measurable benefits in the present.
Why do we feel the need to preserve these objects exactly as they are now? Moreover, why can’t we accept that they will never remain exactly the same, no matter what we do to them?
In many ways, our obsession with preservation is just a reflection of our own attempts to deny the unstoppable effects of time. One day in the future, our works will be reduced to dust and forgotten—and this is terrifying. The situation stems from the same culture that maintains a multimillion-dollar cosmetic industry for anti-aging face creams. The term “face-lift” is even applied frequently to building restoration projects. Such a mindset detracts from the pure visual enjoyment of these masterpieces; worse, it injects a sense of collective, primal fear into our response to those masterworks.
Robert Smithson, the artist who created the famous Spiral Jetty in Utah’s Great Salt Lake, was well known for his alternative approach to art conservation. He defied convention by maintaining that works of art are given life by their creators and then sent into the world to exist by themselves, without warranting future involvement on our part. There is something very calming about this outlook on art. Fear is replaced by time-worn appreciation, the same feeling we get from an oft-used shirt, a well-lived life. The struggle against time is an ill-chosen fight, because in the end we will always, undoubtedly, lose. Maybe if we could let this outlook seep into our conservation efforts in the smallest of ways, we could gain something intangible which even the most faithful restoration could never provide. Maybe it is our ability to appreciate works of art for what they are, and not the works of art themselves, that is most in need of restoration.

David Furman is an internationally recognized ceramicist and artist. His work emerges from not material but ideas, which grow out of his personal experiences and explorations of the people and world around him. He has received numerous fellowships and honors from organizations such as the National Endowment for the Arts and the Fulbright Program, and has served as the U.S. State Department’s cultural envoy to Honduras.
Furman’s latest works are part of an exhibit at the Fuller Craft Museum in Brockton entitled “Fresh Figurines: A New Look at a Historic Art Form.” This past Thursday, he lectured at the Harvard Ceramics Studio and shared a survey of his 40 years of commitment to the arts.
The Harvard Crimson: You have exhibited in more than 500 exhibitions and have delivered over 150 public lectures and workshops, but you have also recently worked to share your art with children in impoverished communities in Peru and Honduras. In what way does that impact the way you view your art, humanity, and the human image?
David Furman:     I think starting in about 1989 or 1990, I set up a little ceramics facility at the Ontario Teen Center, which is near Claremont, California, where I taught for 35 years. … The pretext, of course, was ceramics, but the real issue was being able to swap stories and find common ground and to feel safe and secure in an area that’s ravaged by the more negative aspects of our cultures. … So I like to think that what we did there, that was a beginning for me, but as kind of a catalytic change for the community. But, for me, it really spun me around and had me think about possibilities that heretofore I hadn’t really considered seriously.
THC: You are perhaps best known for your ‘trompe l’oeil’ works and erotic vegetable teapots, and everything is described as very whimsical. What prompted you to turn 180 degrees from such vibrancy and complexity and color to mannequins?
DF: Actually, I have had this idea for some time, at least a year or so before I began the project … I wanted my figures to be sensual and erotic like the work that I saw and that I was aware of in China ... I wanted to marry two different aesthetic sensibilities: that of ancient China with contemporary American. What grew out of that were these pieces that were traditionally glazed in a very Chinese style with figures that were covered with what they call a Celedon glaze which is a very traditional, elegant glaze developed in China.
THC: The Office for the Arts at Harvard claims that your newest work explores human interaction by using the mannequin, an anonymous figure. Can you tell me a bit about your exhibit and why did you choose to express your art through anonymity?
DF:    Those little wooden mannequin figures are typically used in art classes and teaching figure and perspective and relationships. Yet they were always interesting, sort of ambiguous, androgynous, anonymous figures with no breath of emotion connected to them. And so my thought was, here is this perfect iconic image that I could transform. As Shakespeare said, “All the world’s a stage,” and so I could kind of create the stage where I could use subtleties, nuance, and suggested intimacy to breathe life into these otherwise lifeless figures that are used for a very different purpose … The thing that you’ll find in common is a sense of humor maybe, a sense of passion, a curiosity, but all stemming from ideas rather than a material.
THC: Would you be surprised to hear that most students here probably do not know very much about ceramics or sculpting? You’ve taught at universities, so what do you think students need to know or be exposed to in order to appreciate these subjects more?
DF:  The truth of the matter is I didn’t teach there to make a bunch of artists. My goal wasn’t to create little miniature David Furmans. You know, one is enough … Rather than producing people who become artists, I want to create an environment where people can have an artful experience, where they can problem-solve by utilizing hands-on techniques to explore aesthetic sensibility. Ninety-five percent of the people that I’ve taught weren’t art majors, but I hope that I’ve created an experience for them to come to terms with understanding, at least in part, what that artful process is like. If they can impart that or have dialogue about that with their family when they grow up, with their children, when they look at a pot, they’ll say, “I understand that on a level that lets me know how that was made and how difficult it was, and how passionate the individual has to be to make that, to bring it into fruition.”

Like the Gospel of Matthew, Henri Cole’s new collection of poems begins with a genealogy. “Asleep in Jesus at Rest,” the first work in “Touch,” describes Cole’s origins in biblical language: his ancestors have names like Noah and William Christmas, they are listed in the Census, and “Those that lived were sprinkled on their foreheads / and went to Sunday school.” The good news unfolded through the rest of the slim volume is the conviction in each of its works that beauty transcends suffering; it floats above trials and hides in the most unexpected depths of grief. “Touch” is arranged in a triptych, like Cole’s 2007 anthology “Blackbird and the Wolf” and his 2003 “Middle Earth.” The themes holding each section together are more obviously heavy than in previous works—his mother’s death, war and mortality, and a failing relationship—yet as he has been since the explosive “Visible Man,” Cole pens poetry that is always becoming more refined and more reserved.
Though restrained in his production, and despite his mother’s words “Don’t be an open book”—the epigraph of the first section—Cole is still an autobiographical poet through and through. If anything, the epigraph seems to serve more as a reminder for Cole himself, as he constantly has to moderate his impulse to reveal himself completely. The “I” figures largely in the majority of his poems, and his first name is mentioned in several others. “Immortal,” for instance, is a whimsical description of the life of a woman, remembered in front of a mother’s coffin. “‘Look, Henri, isn’t she beautiful!’ / my aunt exclaimed, / but I couldn’t. / I don’t need to know / what I already know.” The fantastical woman who “sits in an / acrylic cylinder / at a temperature of zero / … for five / hundred years” is related by the dialogue to his own family. Given that his most recent works have dealt with a dying mother, works like “Dead Mother” and others with similar references resonate as honest confrontations with all-too real events the poet has himself suffered. Cole’s decision to open the volume with a deeply personal matter lends credibility to the voice throughout “Touch.” 
For lesser poets, this commitment to honesty would quickly disintegrate into unmitigated self-indulgence and even irrelevance. Cole carefully avoids this, in part through his continued reliance on the pseudo-sonnet form he developed in years past. By restricting himself to an elegant 14-line structure in most of his poems, Cole is not only able to give distinct shape to his musings but also to develop them into surprising and poignant revelations by the poem’s end—which mirrors the traditional twist of a sonnet. In “Shrike” Cole recounts a horrid fight between his parents: “Once, long ago, when they were quarrelling about money, / Father put Mother’s head in the oven. / ‘Who are you?’ it pleaded from the hell mouth.” Cole is able to gently tease out a consequence bigger than the event with the help of his formal retraint—and the result is more life-affirming than the previous content would immediately suggest. In the final line he writes, “Earth was drawing me into existence.” 
Thus, Cole writes difficult poetry—but not in the same sense that defines many other contemporary poets. Cole’s works are unconcerned with academic debates; though clearly aware of the canon preceding him, he is not obsessed by it and resists being reactionary. That is, though his topics are complex, Cole refuses to play language games that would only obscure his intent: for the poems in “Touch” language is a means rather than an end. His agenda is summed up in “Orange Hole”: “introducing the idea of beauty as a salve / and of aesthetics making something difficult accessible.” By stating plainly and sincerely the ebb and flow of emotion, Cole’s poetry demands that beauty be recognized even in situations where life seems painfully absent.
It is in this precarious balance between relentless honesty and measured control that lines that could be passé are rendered timeless, as moments of profound discovery. In “Cherry Blossom Storm” his mother’s surgery is described in graphic detail: “Then a collar incision / was made at the base of my neck and the strap muscles / incised, the dissection continuing sharply over / both my lobes as inferior vessels and veins / were isolated, litigated, and divided …” It is astounding then, that the conclusion the poet ultimately struggles to get to is that “Sometimes / awful things have their own kind of beauty.” What would be a trite aphorism is transformed by Cole’s artistry into a defiant testimony.
While largely successful, the devotion to authenticity fails Cole at times in the final section of “Touch.” The most egregious example is in his frequent use of abbreviated text-message language. In “Laughing Monster,” a meditation on identity in a relationship—“‘Who am I and why?’ Lunging forward / to assume positions so imprecise to our natures”—is disrupted by a parenthetical “it numbs u if it’s real / it numbs ur throat and nose, and it numbs u inside.” Though Cole’s audacity is laudable, his attempt to hint at modern developments in technology is still too forced to ring true.
However, this blemish is only a minor by-product of the ideology that makes the rest of the collection so powerful. Cole takes a daring approach to very human themes and avoids hiding his revelations in overwrought sentimentality or in overly flourished language. As beauty presents itself subtly in times of anguish, so too does the beauty of “Touch” emerge, delicate and tender.

Shortly after hearing of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs’s untimely death last week, I began to see the same YouTube link posted over and over again on email lists and Facebook feeds: the video of Jobs’s 2005 Stanford University commencement address.
“Remembering that I’ll be dead soon,” Jobs said then, “is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.” Given such a subject, it is hardly surprising that this speech is what we have turned to in making sense of a life.
We seem to take it for granted that graduation speeches should be personal, even intimate. It makes sense to us that only by trudging through the swamps of past experience can speakers come up with a generalizable set of maxims to share with the audience.  We laud those speeches that are most intensely personal because they seem to resist the urge of spouting empty platitudes, of giving way to tired cliché.
This was not always the case. Such a standard of soul-baring, an expectation of frank confession, is in fact a relatively recent phenomenon—a shift in the podium’s purpose from instruction to inspiration.
American scholar Ralph Waldo Emerson, class of 1821, used his invitation to speak to Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa Society as an opportunity to propose an agenda for the American intellectual identity based on skepticism and individual inquiry.
Indeed, laying out a plan or theory would come to characterize the most significant commencement addresses of the 20th century. It is easy to forget that Winston Churchill’s most well-remembered phrase—“An iron curtain has descended across the continent”—was delivered in a 1946 graduation address at Westminster College in Missouri.
Barely a year later, Secretary of State George Marshall used his Harvard commencement address to present a strategy for European economic reconstruction and the United States’ role in it—articulating the main points of what would become the Marshall Plan.
In each of these cases, the emphasis remained firmly on the message. It was important to invite a speaker with the knowledge and experience to formulate a well thought-out lecture. Transmission of information then took precedent over personality.
Speeches are still sometimes valued for being informative, at least here at Harvard.  Last May, Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf discussed her administration’s goals for development; the year before, former Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter ’61 tackled the philosophy of constitutional interpretation.
And yet which speech has lingered in the memories of 2000 Harvard graduates—Nobel laureate Amartya Sen’s nuanced exploration of contemporary globalization, or the self-deprecating humor of Conan C. O’Brien ’85’s Class Day address? Even Sirleaf’s address struck a balance between political discourse and personal narrative, as she discussed the obstacles she overcame to become Liberia’s first female president.
No longer are we content to depart from an intellectual institution by digesting one more intellectual argument. Today, the formulation of a national agenda like the Marshall Plan would be out of place. Instead we want a personality, someone distanced from academia, someone who can explain to us not what or how to think but how to live.
This can be a good thing. Intertwining speech and speaker allows for the specific sort of wisdom to which we simply don’t have access yet—the wisdom of age and experience, sharpened and personified by the act of public speaking. And refusing to separate speeches from their perpetrator helps cultivate an amicable skepticism. We can interpret a speech not in isolation but as part of a discourse, reflecting the ideas, perspective, and background that have colored the speaker’s intentions and beliefs.
But it is telling how much we hunger for a speaker who can delve into personal experience and emerge with a short tidy maxim, a take-home quote. With our generation’s nearly unlimited access to words spoken, sung, chanted, and proclaimed, we look to the commencement address to boil down the mass of information into something manageable—to make a stab at telling us what we really need to know.
So it is unsurprising that the language of many graduation speeches is so naturally disenchanting. Our society has long lost any sense of a single authority, a single truth. Attempts to proclaim one through this culminating ceremony of maturity can only ring hollow.
A response then, is to turn the speech around—to interpret the words within the context of the person forming them. Sifting through meaning in someone else’s life will, we hope, give us some kind of insight into our futures outside Harvard Yard. Hence the fascination over Jobs’s 2005 commencement address. Are these words what defined him? Are they what made his life worthwhile? And what relation can they have to our own?

The Crimson found itself in the middle all weekend. But it wasn’t necessarily in the fairways—Harvard finished in 12th place in a field of 22 teams, beating out four Ivy competitors.
Five Harvard golfers—captains Tony Grillo, senior Mark Pollak, sophomore Seiji Liu, and juniors Michael Lai and Theo Lederhausen—competed in the Philadelphia Big 5 Invitational that was held at Plymouth Country Club, a 6600-yard, par-70 course.
The Crimson took third among Ivies over the weekend, ending the Invitational 23 strokes behind the tournament champions Dartmouth and nine strokes behind fourth-place University of Pennsylvania. Harvard was able to outperform Ancient Eight rivals Yale, Princeton, Cornell, and Brown.
“Dartmouth played extremely well … but it was good to see that we finished ahead of four Ivy League teams,” Pollak said. “That is our base of self-comparison. The fact that we beat four of the Ivies is a good sign—it shows we are moving in the right direction.”
Though the Big Green easily defeated Harvard, the win by a familiar Ivy rival proved to the Crimson that the team can compete.
“It was definitely a tournament we could have won if we played well,” Grillo said. “We have very much been neck-and-neck with Dartmouth over the past year or so. We wish we could have played better.”
Although the team did not finish in the mix this weekend, the squad is not feeling a sense of desperation—the Crimson understands its standing and will continue to improve.
“We have tremendous potential to play a lot better, but things are not lining up right now,” Pollak said. “It does not have anything to do with the effort we are putting in—it’s just a matter of playing well at the right time.”
Grillo had the team’s best performance over the weekend, finishing in 25th place in field of 114 competitors. The captain played a solid round on Saturday, finishing one over par with four bogeys and three birdies.
But on Sunday, missed putts plagued Grillo, who finished seven over, only managing to birdie once on the day.
“It was very easy to overthink it,” Grillo said. “If you would have watched my round on Sunday, besides the putting, you would probably have thought that I played better than the first day.”
Pollak and Liu tied in the tournament, both shooting 150 over the two-day event, good enough for 38th-place overall.
Pollak started the tournament off slowly, shooting an eight-over 78 on the first day of competition, but he rebounded on Sunday with a two-over performance.
“I put myself through many bad places around the green,” Pollak said. “My short game is not good enough right now to allow me to make up those strokes.”
Lai and Lederhausen rounded out the Crimson squad, finishing in 66th and 97th place, respectively.
A constant theme for the Harvard team throughout the weekend was its short games. Players pointed out that putting was a particular challenge for the Crimson during the invitational.
Sebestian Backlund of Francis Mason won the tournament with an impressive showing on Sunday, shooting four strokes under par to finish two under for the tournament.
Two Dartmouth golfers—Peter Williamson and Joe Maziar—placed in the top five of the competition this past weekend. Williamson came in second place at one under, and Joe Maziar finished the tournament in fourth with an overall score of two over.
“The course was playing really tough,” Pollak said. “The greens were really fast and undulating.”

“There’s a framed diploma on the wall one and a half feet to the right of my head that I could pull off and use to crack your skull if you tried anything,” says a recently retired C.I.A. operative to a young intelligence analyst who is determined to get to the bottom of the murder of an informant in Paris. This sort of aggressive dialogue runs through “The Farm,” a new play written by Walt McGough and directed by David R. Gammons running at the Boston Playwrights Theatre until October 23. Through a conversation that often feels like a duel between a seasoned field operative and a young up-and-coming agent, “The Farm” brilliantly explores the emotional cost and moral ambiguities faced by the members of America’s intelligence community.
Finn (Dale Place) has been a C.I.A. field operative for over 20 years. However, he decides to retire shortly after one of his most promising informants, Kalil, dies mysteriously in Paris. Parker (Lindsey McWhorter), a young analyst, has been tasked with trying to minimize any potential damage that the murder might cause. Throughout their conversation the ghost of Kalil (Nael Nacer), never named but referred to as “the enemy,” stalks across the stage, providing Finn with a visible reminder of all of the lives he was forced to take in the line of duty.
The acting is superb all around and Place plays the cold warrior Finn brilliantly. His character is almost bipolar; he displays a cool, ruthless confidence when he holds the upper hand, but becomes a fidgeting emotional wreck when pressed on his conduct in the field. His Finn has bravado and charisma, but also vulnerability, and every minute bodily movement works to communicate the emotional turmoil inside him.
McWhorter’s Parker is almost the exact opposite of Finn. While he expresses his professionalism with a disarming swagger, McWhorter almost never breaks out of an icy shell. This means she doesn’t steal the spotlight from Place, but makes the moments when she does begin to reveal herself some of the most profound in the play. Nacer manages to capture a sense of otherworldly detachment in his portrayal of “the enemy,” as Kalil’s ghost takes on broader significance as a phantom representation of all the people Finn has killed. Over the course of the play he assumes the personalities of various people, all the while maintaining an almost blank expression on his face. He manages to consistently maintain the illusion that he is just a figment of Finn’s imagination without sacrificing emotional gravity. His performance allows the production room to grow in intriguing and even unexpected directions.
The sense of conflict is heightened by very well-timed use of sound effects. In one scene McWhorter, to counter a point made by Place, throws his case file to him. When it hits the desks, the sound is magnified and enhanced by a recording of a file hitting a desk played over the speakers.  The sound is larger than life, and reflects the importance of the files for Finn. This, combined with sound effects that are played when Nacer is on stage, allows for Finn’s unconscious to become a character in its own right. For example, the sound of a ticking clock plays when Nacer first enters the stage. He asks Finn for the time while Finn is having a conversation with Parker. The effect is a visual and aural representation of Finn’s shattered emotional state.
In contrast to the stellar performances by the cast, the directing is at times underwhelming. There are some crucial moments in the play in which the actors are actually held back by their direction. In one key scene towards the end of the play, during which Finn finally begins to confront his decisions, he delivers a large part of his monologue with his back to the audience. Given that his face is incredibly expressive, concealing it from the audience during the play’s emotional climax is an unfortunate choice. What should be an incredibly moving scene becomes awkward when deprived of Place’s face, which is otherwise used to great effect to communicate Finn’s emotional nuance.
Despite these directorial hiccups, Walt McGough’s “The Farm” is an enthralling new piece of theatre that showcases some terrific acting. With a combination of dark comedy and psychological insight, it offers a look into the human mind while also giving us a sneak peak into the back rooms of Langley, Va. The result is a modern spy thriller of a quality that is rarely seen on stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Bow & Arrow Press in the basement of Adams House, the obsolete art of the letterpress thrives. Originally Gutenberg’s invention, the letterpress works by rolling a piece of paper over a raised surface that has an inked negative of the desired text. The Bow & Arrow’s lair is loaded with personal history: the space exhibits artwork from alums long gone, cases of type labeled “Our Faith” that were donated by a monastery, and a pair of KISS figurines that have long resided at the press.
“What people really like in a letterpress nowadays is the emboss, because that shows there was physical type hitting the paper,” says Ted Ollier, the non-resident tutor and conceptual artist who runs the press. “If you were printing invoices back in 1932, the last thing you would want is an emboss on your print. Today, the deeper the emboss, the better.” The difference of a few millimeters in typeface can convey a world of meaning, an engagement with the material that cannot be created by pressing “command P” and waiting for your inkjet to print paper. While a wide range of fonts has become accessible to the computer-literate public, a higher level of practical and aesthetic knowledge continues to rest in the minds of a small circle of connoisseurs.
THE FONT FAD
“What you know today is very new: digital typography,” says Elizabeth Resnick, a Professor of graphic design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Thanks to the advent of the personal computer, our modern relationship with fonts is a novel one. Every time we send an email or create a document, a circumscribed array of fonts presents themselves. “Working on the PC really came into play in the very early 80s … For students today, born into an age of personal computers, it was here when you arrived,” she says.
As such, the average person has an understanding of fonts like never before. Evidence of the new cultural relevance of font abounds. The independent feature-length documentary “Helvetica,” centered on the titular typeface, screened worldwide when it was released in 2007. And just last year, Cambridge resident and preeminent typographer Matthew Carter won a MacArthur Grant. Carter has designed over 60 typeface families and over 250 individual fonts during his approximately five decade-long career.
The new appreciation of fonts generates popular narratives about a few fonts in particular. In a light-hearted vein, the internet has bubbled over with vitriolic hate of Comic Sans, evident in the proliferation of websites such as ihatecomicsans.com and comicsanscriminal.com. However, there is a story behind Comic Sans well known to those in graphic design that does not place the blame on the font itself but rather on a criminal overuse of it.
Comic Sans was initially designed for a very specific software program packaged into Microsoft Word that was supposed to be used for comic strips. “[It’s] a weird fluke,” says typographer-cum-lawyer Matthew J. Butterick ’92. “When people say they hate Comic Sans, what they’re saying is that we hate the people in the world who have access to Comic Sans and are not taking a moment to realize that maybe it’s not the best thing to use on the side of an ambulance.” In this case, even non-specialists see the dissonance between the font and its function. Anyone can be a critic.
Our perception of the font universe, however, is almost directly controlled by which fonts Microsoft Word chooses to package in its software. Is this is a cause for aesthetic rebellion? When Yale College requests a customized font–a font that was developed by Carter and is available to only Yale affiliates–it raises the question of whether our broad commitment to Times New Roman ignores the potential of font. For Resnick, it’s a tool that is in our control as it has never been before.
CHOOSING TYPE
Butterick, who wrote the book “Typography for Lawyers,” a guide for creating “polished and persuasive documents”, was a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator during his time at Harvard and worked at the Bow & Arrow Press. For Butterick, the reason for knowing the essentials of typography is simple: “Any time writing is important, typography is important.” His appeal to lawyers is not based on a belief that only the legal profession needs typographic intentionality; it is based on the fact that they are self-publishers. “I’m not telling lawyers that typography is the be-all and end-all of their work, but it’s part of the way you present the work and it affects how people absorb it,” Butterick says. “If typography can help you make a point, why wouldn’t you use it?”
This argument is not restricted to lawyers; any person who creates documents is a kind of self-publisher. And as much as Butterick jokes about Times New Roman being a non-choice, it does not mean it lacks a visual impact on our written content. All fonts are have a distinctive visual content, and with that a certain set of consequences. For those who print out word documents, participation in this process is unavoidable; font is never invisible. According to this line of thinking, being deliberate in font choice is a clear practical good.
There is another way of justifying the value of fonts, however, that does not rest on their instrumental value. Jake J. Freyer ’15, a Crimson design comper, has been studying and producing calligraphy since eighth or ninth grade. His academic folders are decorated with the kind of elaborate Blackletter calligraphy that would give my label maker an inferiority complex. “The way type design has developed in the past few hundred years, it’s very interesting, but it’s gone a little bit utilitarian,” Freyer muses. “I really like the old style elegance.” His disdain for a few centuries of fonts really puts in perspective music aficionados’ mourning of the seventies. By elegance, Freyer is referring to the grace of a specific set of serif-inspired typefaces, like Garamond.
The text of this article is written in a typeface with serifs, or short flicks on the end of character strokes and stems. My name above, on the other hand, is written in a sans-serif typeface, which became popular only in the nineteenth century.
I ask Freyer if he could identify fonts on sight for me. The few times he cannot identify a font immediately, he eliminates potential choices and then reflects on the history and function of a few favorites. “Caslon Pro goes back to the 1700s. William Caslon was a British typographer for the king,” Freyer recalls, while I stifle my surprise at hearing Caslon is an actual person. Freyer’s deep interest in ancient typographic figures suggests the possibility of aesthetic creativity, even historical reverence, in a form whose primary use is now in a static set of choices standardized across computers everywhere.
SEEKING INVISIBILITY
I invited Resnick to take a look at the design of The Harvard Lampoon, the so-called humor magazine that used to be occasionally published by the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization of the same name, and The Advocate Gazing at the cover of The Harvard Lampoon, Resnick identifies two different fonts in the magazine heading. One is particularly hard to place.
“It is probably Futura, but it’s been altered by giving it parallel cuts at the edges of the ‘A’ and the ‘M’ … If you look at the tops of those letters, the sharp points, that too is very Futura,” says Resnick. The choice presents an objective set of implications. “It speaks of the industrial era but it has a little bit of Art Deco in it. There’s a little bit of decoration in it.”
As for the title of The Advocate, Resnick mines the slight curve of just one letter for a world of meaning. “The way in which it’s drawn is a digital response. Look at the way the curves are drawn, especially on the ‘C.’ It’s not a smooth ‘C,’” says Resnick. “It’s like it would be in a digital ‘C;’ it’s pixilated … The type itself, because of the way in which it is drawn, reveals to me it’s from a digital time.” To my untrained eye, I just see the third letter of the alphabet, but one letter for Resnick can tell a historical story. For typographers, the unit of meaning is miniscule. The finest grain of typographical substance is not in the differences between typefaces or even those between given letters. These atoms of meaning are the subtle curves and flourishes within each line of a letter and its infinite variations. For experts, the art in font occurs primarily at the microscopic level.
However, my inability to see these hidden meanings in font is the goal at which good typography aims. In the misuse of fonts—like Comic Sans on an ambulance—the mismatch of style and substance is clear. But when a font is achieving its purpose, it gains seamlessness, even invisibility. Then, it can be truly appreciated by those who notice a distinctly rounded serif.
“If you choose the right typeface and use it the right way, chances are the reader won’t notice,” says Freyer. “What you hope will happen is that they’ll read the text and the use of that font will make it smoother, or it will evoke the right mood.” For Freyer, this function of font is analogous to that of punctuation in a sentence. A reader may not notice each punctuation mark, but every one of them works in concert to frame the meaning of actual content.
EXPRESSIVE PRESS
Back in the Bow & Arrow Press, Ollier shows me the layout of a California Job Case, a wooden box called a typecase drawer that is used to store the letters, symbols, and numbers used in letterpress printing. The drawer is organized to make typesetting more expedient, the letterpress equivalent of our QWERTY keyboards. The letters are not arranged alphabetically and seem haphazard until Ollier explains, “The order of letters in the English language is not ‘a,’ ‘b,’ ‘c,’ ‘d,’ ‘e.’” It is in the order of greatest frequency, at least for lowercase letters: “a,” “t,” “e,” “s,” “o,” and “n.” Numerals and symbols are at the top of the case and at the right are less frequently used capital letters. I am reminded that in an art form lacking automation, this sort of preparation is necessary.
That said, the press is not a time capsule immune to the needs of modern typography. It seeks to revivify an old form but functions also to recast the digital fonts of today in their historical context. Daniel A. Gross ’13, a Student Print Master at the Bow & Arrow Press, uses Times New Roman for his papers. After two years of working at the press, he does not plan to stop using Times New Roman. However, he has an appreciation for letterpress and font choice. Perhaps it is reserved for the three hours of Open Press Night every Thursday—when any student can come and experiment with the press—and put aside when reading period comes along, but the awareness is there. “It’s nice to take things that people look at every day and charge them with significance. People read text all day long, especially at this school, and to take that kind of text [as having] an aesthetic meaning, not just an expressive meaning, is great.”

I suspect there are Harvard alumni on both sides of the “occupation” of Wall Street. I can imagine a considerable Crimson presence among the privileged protesters in downtown New York. Harvard graduates, however, are more likely to be among the occupied than the occupying, representing a shameless financial industry that sent the American economy crashing without accepting any responsibility or penalty for their role in the collapse.
While some extremists might call for the worst of the weasels to be water-boarded, I’d settle for seeing them ad-boarded myself. Unfortunately, the Harvard  University administration no longer has authority over these people. Harvard students, however, can help fight the good fight. Not everyone has the means or demeanor for radical rebellion. But rather than join the occupation of Wall Street, I suggest that Harvard seniors simply give up pursuing an occupation on Wall Street.
The number of Harvard graduates heading to the financial sector remains disheartening. The Crimson surveys the post-graduation plans of Harvard’ senior class annually, yielding responses from 35 percent to 55 percent of the senior class. In 2007, the survey reported that a staggering 47 percent of workforce-bound seniors took jobs in finance or consulting. In 2008, the survey number dipped to 39 percent. In 2009, it fell to 20 percent, with 11.5 percent in finance. That’s progress, but it still means that one in 10 workforce-bound seniors are headed straight for soul-sucking corporate servitude.
I don’t know what the numbers were in my graduating class, but I do know that those who headed to Wall Street (or its satellite cesspools abroad) didn’t always like what they found. In the Harvard University Class of 2005 Fifth Anniversary Report, published last year, a number of alumni expressed their disillusionment with the corporate world.
One former Crimson columnist wrote a book while in college aimed at “encouraging more young women to enter politics and dedicate their lives to civic engagement.” Here’s what she had to say of her post-Harvard job:
“Since graduation I’ve been working at a multinational investment bank helping rich companies become richer. I’m not quite where I want to end up at this point, but I’ve been told that ‘putting in your time’ in the corporate world will pay off eventually. Let’s see how things look at the next Reunion.”
A second alum, who also went to work in finance, expressed similar reservations about her career choice. Though she claimed to “love” her work, she also admitted that she was “attempting to find a job that does not involve as many spreadsheets as my current position and will allow me to better serve others.” She is now employed in government.
Another classmate put things even more bluntly:
“Harvard teaches you to follow your dreams—and then the recruiters show up on campus and remind you that the one path to true enlightenment is management consulting.”
I know that three examples don’t an airtight case make. I’m sure there are plenty of Harvard graduates who are perfectly happy with their transition from final clubs to finance. But, with some exceptions, you don’t want to be hanging out with these people. And the quotations above should make seniors wary of working on Wall Street.
Of course, avoiding the Siren call of Morgan Stanley isn’t as easy as it sounds. The Office of Career Services has been cramming the corporate sector down Crimson throats for years. While Harvard has authority over OCS, we’re not going to see a ban on investment banks, a la the ROTC ban, anytime soon. The University knows where its bread is buttered.
But after graduating, students can choose where to get their butter (for most, the House dining hall is no longer an option). They can work for non-profits, for government, and think tanks. They can be engineers and entrepreneurs and educators and environmentalists and journalists and artists and activists. They can work in the private sector for companies that actually make products and create jobs. They can go to graduate school or professional school and become doctors and lawyers and professors and scientists and politicians. Some of them can even win Oscars or play in the NFL.
Many of these careers may not be as financially rewarding as investment banking. But I assure you, they will almost certainly make you less insipid than your profiteering peers. Harvard alumni are often maligned on “Main Street.” You might as well mitigate rather than cultivate that resentment.
Moreover, breaking ranks with the bankers will provide you with better banter. Derivatives make for dry cocktail conversations. If you thought the finance types were boring in college, just wait until you see them in their natural habitat.
So if your blood runs a cool Crimson rather than a revolutionary red, don’t worry. You don’t have to occupy Wall Street. Just boycott it during the job hunt. You’ll find your more colorful classmates have gone elsewhere.
David Weinfeld ’05, a former Crimson editorial columnist, is a doctoral candidate in American Jewish history at New York  University.

Nothing screams “disillusionment” like having your mother’s corpse rotting in your washtub. Oddly sympathetic and certainly unconventional, Andy J. Boyd ’14’s self-written and directed “Affordable Rates and Color TV” narrates a coming-of-age story that finds a triumphant balance between a tinge of bitterness and a dose of hope. Directed and written with insightful subtlety, the play—which ran from October 6 to 8 in the Adams Pool Theatre—aims to make bold statements about life and the decisions that shape it. To Boyd’s credit, it is mostly able to do so, but is occasionally hindered by the unsteadiness of the supporting actors.
Set against the backdrop of a high school prom, the play follows Kim (Mary C. Hallowell ’14), the caretaker of a run-of-the-mill motel, as she is faced with a fork in the road: does she leave with her deadbeat boyfriend Scott (William D.  Kehler ’12), or stay put in the place she has always known as home? To exacerbate the obvious problem of her mother’s dead body, Kim must face romantic tension between her and Frankie (Omar A. Cancio ’12), her childhood best friend. These intrapersonal conflicts ultimately reach a boiling point, and Kim must decide which path she wants to take.
Hallowell presents Kim with such earnest zeal that it is hard not to root for her. Whether in a small bite at her nails to show she’s nervous or the silly giggle she emits while dancing in her mother’s old wedding dress, Hallowell’s attention to detail elevates Kim from simply another costume that is zipped on for the night to an actual person that has both virtues and faults. Kim is a coward, but is still strong in her conviction. Her character is filled with paradoxes, but mountains of contradictions and incongruities typify real people all too often. Hallowell is able to encompass all of these competing facets with an easy fluidity.
At times, though, Hallowell’s performance seems at odds with her co-stars’, not so much due to mismatched chemistry, but rather to the other actors’ uneasiness with their own characters. Scott is clearly bad news and the most emotionally convoluted character, but Kehler seems unable to commit to the role. The sleazy “baby” that Scott often coos to Kim feels awkward on Kehler’s tongue. While Kehler shows glimpses of true assimilation into his character, these are outweighed by moments of discomfort and superficiality. The same could be said for Cancio, who is not fully able to embrace Frankie’s poindexter persona. When Cancio lists off ’80s hits or laughs nervously as Hallowell seduces him, his actions come across—likely unintentionally—as a mere façade.
As a director, Boyd has a talent for displaying tension. The audience is led to fall into a soft lull, but is then delivered a dose of energy that rattles the bones.  Kim is dancing with Frankie in her wedding dress when Scott comes through the door. The air stands still, and the audience holds their breath. The actors’ relative positions in this moment convey the tensions between them better than any shouted line of dialogue. The whole spectacle is startling, and it’s these spikes in emotion that Boyd does best in both his writing and directing.
The technically unobtrusive attitude towards transitions and interludes, which are characterized by blue or no lighting, compliments Boyd’s subtle treatment of life’s most wrenching complications. Boyd never reaches for dramatic effect, preferring to take a more naturalistic approach and trust the intelligence—and intepretive ability—of the audience, a decision which lends itself well to the play’s overall tone.
Claire P. Flintoff ’14’s set design contributes to the atmosphere by leaving everything to the audience while providing clear but unobtrusive guidance. In the set’s portrayal of the check-in lobby of a motel, two doors that lead in and out provide a delightful freedom for the audience. They never see the mother’s dead body, but they know that it is behind the white door.
Boyd’s play is packed with bitter, cynical black humor levied by a sense of humanity, a choice of tone that underpins the play’s worldview. There is no black or white, only grey. Ben (William H. Ryan ’14), a corporate worker who checks into the motel and serves as Kim’s strange guru, says it perfectly. “Life is hard. It will be hard either way, and so if you look at your life and it’s hard you shouldn’t say that it means you chose wrong. It just means you chose to live.” Boyd’s play resonates with modern, young adult anxieties, and while there are few hiccups due to an emotional disconnect between actors and characters, it retains a lasting, contemplative effect.

October 13-15, 7:30 p.m., October 15, 2:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Lenora C. Murphy ’12
Produced by Aly G. Martinez ’13 and Civry P. Melvin ’14
The already chaotic world of “Hamlet” takes a maddening turn towards the absurd and existential in Tom Stoppard’s tragicomedy “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.” Told from the perspective of Shakespeare’s minor characters, primarily the two oft-confused, at times intellectual courtiers of the title, Stoppard chooses the original’s background as the ideal stage on which to question the meaning of self and being. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club (HRDC) will attempt to tackle these concerns, and the infamously convoluted manner in which Stoppard expresses them, in their new production of the play.
“The main issues at stake within this show are what it means to be a person, what it is to have an identity, to choose an identity,” says director Lenora C. Murphy ’12. This year’s production explores the crisis of identity on several levels, the most important being the courtiers’ inability to differentiate themselves from each other. “We often feel like two halves of one person,” says Ben A. Silva ’14 of his character Rosencrantz, the complement of Eli E. Kahn ’13’s Guildenstern. “As a result, each of us feels incomplete in some way and indistinguishable from the other one.”
Whether it is the courtiers’ disorganized attempts at philosophical reasoning or their sporadic interactions with a sexually charged traveling troupe of performers, the play is an intriguing marriage of intellectual humor and tragic emotion. “There are moments that I find poignant and moments that I find truly hilarious,” says Kahn.
The show promises to be an intimate one, in which the cast actively engages with the audience and in so doing blurs the line between what it is to act and what it is to be one’s true self. This production further individualizes itself by not only including females in an originally predominantly masculine cast, but also reversing the gender of several key characters. The HRDC’s “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead” aims to bring wit, introspection and charged emotion to Stoppard’s unique exploration of human choice and purpose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Heading into Saturday’s game, it was clear that the 2011 edition of the Big Red was far different from the team Harvard trounced a year ago.
Cornell already had two wins under its belt—matching its season total from last year—and QB Jeff Mathews was living up to the expectations placed upon him since he earned the starting job as a rookie.
Harvard, on the other hand, was still facing uncertainty under center. After senior starter Collier Winters learned earlier in the week that he would not play, junior Colton Chapple—earning his third start in as many games—had his work cut out for him.
Chapple faced the huge task of beating another conference foe, ensuring the squad maintained pace with defending champion Penn, and keeping up with the prolific Mathews.
In Saturday’s 41-31 win, Chapple proved that he could do all that and much more.
The game became a QB showdown right from the start. On the first drive, Mathews needed only three plays and a little over a minute to score the opening touchdown.
The pressure increased on Chapple, who had to play catch-up right away. The junior showed his nerves, opting to run the ball several times and failing to move his team far down the field.
“We came out a little sluggish,”  Chapple said. “Playing on the road is never easy, [but] you have to get it done.”
It took a big play from the Crimson secondary to get Chapple going. Captain Alex Gedeon was at the right place at the right time when he came up with the ball after it bounced off Mathews’ intended receiver.
The interception set up the visiting squad on its own 19-yard line, and it was from there that Chapple started to find his rhythm with 6:01 left in the first quarter.
After a nine-yard completion to senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian on first down and rookie Zach Boden’s run for eight, Chapple threw a 41-yard toss to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch to put Harvard at the Cornell 23.
The Crimson quarterback did not stop there, finding sophomore Andrew Berg for eight yards before hitting senior Adam Chrissis for the touchdown. Chapple did not have any incomplete passes on the drive.
Chapple’s confidence increased tremendously as the game progressed.
The junior finished 23-of-38 and had 414 yards on the day, good for sixth on the single-game total offense category in school history.
“The kid has done a great job,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We always say he’s not that pretty, he’s not that this ... But he’s 5-1 as a starter as a second-string quarterback.”
Chapple and Mathews both boasted completion rates of 60 percent on the day, but the Harvard backup finished with nearly 100 more yards—despite only completing two more passes than his rival—and four touchdowns, besting Mathews’ three.
Chapple had a career game and made his case for the starting spot. Murphy can’t go wrong by putting either Winters or Chapple at the helm, though it is important to note that all three of the Crimson’s wins this year have come with the backup taking the snaps.
“No matter what happens, we’re in good shape at quarterback,” Murphy said.
SHARING THE WEALTH
Though Chapple led the aerial attack, credit is due to his wide receivers, who outmuscled and outhustled their defenders to make nearly all the important plays.
Three receivers—Sarkisian, Lorditch, and Chrissis—had long receptions of over 40 yards, and five players averaged 16 or more yards per catch.
Sarkisian and Lorditch both were in triple digits, finishing with 112 and 103 yards, respectively.
Sarkisian was Chapple’s receiver of choice. The senior caught the ball seven times, his most important grab coming with the score set at 24-20, advantage Cornell.
After giving Harvard the first down on Big Red territory, Sarkisian streaked down the middle of the field with two defenders chasing him.
Chapple threw him a dangerous pass that somehow found its way past two diving Cornell players, and Sarkisian managed not only to catch the ball but also stay on his feet, strolling into the end zone.
“‘Sark’ battled,” Murphy said. “He’s a kid that came in here recruited as a quarterback, and he’s made a great transition. He gives us great leadership and toughness at the wide receiver position. He catches the tough balls; he gets the tough yardage; he makes the tough blocks. He’s definitely one of the unsung heroes on this team.”
Though the Crimson receivers were impressive, the Big Red’s Shane Savage bested their individual statistics, posting 152 catching yards and two touchdowns.
Savage gave the Harvard defense trouble all day, but fortunately for the Crimson, the rest of Cornell’s receivers weren’t nearly as dangerous.
MIXED REVIEWS
The Harvard secondary, which had allowed only one touchdown in eight quarters up until Saturday, had its ups and downs against the Big Red.
“We didn’t play as well as we could have on the back end,” Murphy said. “I think a lot of that is really great execution and game planning by the coaching staff of Cornell and the execution by Jeff Mathews and his wide receivers.”
But with its offense running on all cylinders, the Crimson defense knew that the pressure was on the opponents to keep up.
After putting up 17 points in the first half, Mathews managed two touchdowns after halftime, one of which came when the game was already out of reach.
With the score set at 41-24 and 10:56 left in the fourth quarter, the Big Red QB threw to Savage again, obtaining the first down at the Cornell 36.
But defensive tackles Matt Lunati and Josue Ortiz put a stop to Mathews, rushing the quarterback for back-to-back sacks and moving the hosts back 11 yards.
Mathews tried throwing again but was hurried by the Harvard defense before getting a short pass out to Grant Gellatly, who could not make up for the lost yardage.
And so the Crimson’s secondary came up big when the team needed it most, sealing the victory for the visiting squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Saturday’s game against the Big Red in Ithaca, N.Y., I expected more of the same from Harvard.
I expected the secondary to continue to dominate after taking the air out of the Brown and Lafayette passing attacks. Sure, I knew Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews was talented. But so was Brown’s Kyle Newhall-Caballero, and all the Bears had to show for their effort was seven points.
I expected the uber-talented defensive line to suffocate the Big Red running game and pile up sacks. Before Saturday’s contest, Harvard had allowed just 74 yards on the ground per game. And with defensive tackles Josue Ortiz and Nnamdi Obukwelu and defensive ends Ben Graeff and Zach Hodges on the line, there’s nowhere for the opposing quarterback to hide.
And I expected more of the same from the offense: namely, nothing too special. Though the team has scored 55 points in two games, the offense hasn’t been a dynamic force. It’s been good enough when paired with a phenomenal defense.
Well, my prediction turned out to be correct about the defensive line. Cornell managed a miniscule 60 yards rushing against the stingy Harvard D-line. As for sacks, Cornell had given up just one in its first three games. On Saturday, the Big Red allowed four. Two came courtesy of Ortiz, who now has four sacks in as many games and remains on that 10-sack pace. And Ortiz’s drops weren’t dainty little tackles. One was an are-we-sure-Mathews’-head-stayed-on hit, and on the other, Ortiz threw the Cornell gunslinger around like a rag doll.
As for my other two predictions—a brilliant performance by the secondary and a mediocre offensive one—I couldn’t have been more wrong.
A couple of breakdowns didn’t help the Crimson secondary’s case, but its struggles were understandable against the brilliant Mathews. I wouldn’t be surprised if, in the next couple of years, he leads Cornell to a victory over the Crimson.
But the story of the day was, unequivocally, the all-of-a-sudden mighty Harvard offense, which amassed 544 total yards on the day. The team had averaged 338 yards in its first three games.
Funny enough, last year against Cornell, it was the Gino Gordon ’11-led running attack that brought the Crimson the win. This time around, Harvard’s quarterback Colton Chapple took the reins.
And the junior second-stringer had a day for the ages with a whopping 414 yards through the air. If you’re keeping score back home, that’s the second-highest total in the Harvard football program’s illustrious 138-year history. Not even some guy named Fitzpatrick ever broke the 400-yard mark.
The fact that Chapple was having an unbelievable day sort of sneaked up on everyone. In the first quarter, he was pretty quiet. So too was the rest of the Harvard offense, which played like it had slept through an alarm and had to rush to the field to make the game. In the second period, things looked slightly better for Chapple and his crew. But only in the third quarter, when the junior was firing with more accuracy than the marksmen of Seal Team Six, did I realize that he was having a huge game.
Chapple became simply unstoppable, placing the ball where only his receiver could get it. On one play near the end of the third quarter, Chapple hit senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian downfield for a touchdown. As the ball approached Sarkisian, two defenders converged, leaving what looked like no room for the ball to get through—yet it did. I’ve watched the replay a couple of times, and I still don’t understand what happened.
But I shouldn’t be surprised. In the second half, Chapple was a magician with the football, making the improbable look easy.
Chapple currently boasts a 5-1 record lifetime as a starter. Yet before the Cornell game, Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he hadn’t thought much about the possibility of having a quarterback controversy on his hands.
“If all of a sudden, Colton goes out there and throws for 350 yards and six touchdowns, then we’ll be happy to have a controversy,” Murphy said a bit incredulously prior to Saturday.
Well, Coach, do we have ourselves a controversy now?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Invited to the West Coast to take part in the lone NCAA Division I men’s lacrosse competition in California, Harvard men’s lacrosse did not disappoint, downing the University of Denver, 19-14, in a matchup of nationally-ranked teams this weekend.
While the Crimson reached the finals of the Ivy League Tournament in 2011, the Pioneers went 15-3 this spring in the best season in school history. Denver fell to eventual national champion Virginia in the semifinals of the NCAA Tournament and finished the year ranked fourth in the country.
But it was Harvard that wowed a crowd of 3,500 gathered at Kezar Stadium on Saturday afternoon for the third annual San Francisco Lacrosse Classic, an exhibition designed to grow the sport of lacrosse and raise funds for Bay Area youth athletics programs.
Sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp and junior midfielder Ryan Stevens each picked up hat tricks for the Crimson, which found itself in an early 3-1 hole before using a string of eight unanswered goals—knocked in by eight different players—to take a 9-3 halftime lead.
The Pioneers responded with a two-goal spurt after the intermission, but a streak of six scores for Harvard pushed the advantage to 15-5 with under six minutes to play in the third quarter. Stevens and Eipp each pitched in with a pair of goals in the decisive outburst of offense.
The Crimson’s lead grew as large as 19-8 with 4:45 remaining in regulation before the Pioneers bounced back with two goals.
Taking advantage of the opportunity to give their players more in-game experience, the two squads played a fifth quarter with a running clock, in which Denver scored four goals to Harvard’s zero.
Three attackmen—senior Jeff Cohen, sophomore Carl Zimmerman, and freshman Matt Scalise—along with junior midfielder Alex White each contributed two scores on the day for the Ivy League representative, which held advantages over its opponent in both shots and ground balls. Rookie Michel Keegan had a team-high two assists to go along with a goal.
Junior goalkeeper Harry Krieger made four saves in just over 45 minutes of action in the Crimson’s only competition of the fall 2011 season. Three other netminders received playing time for Harvard, and a total of 62 players from either side saw the field Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Having reached the midpoint of its fall season, the Harvard sailing team spent the long holiday weekend on the waters in Kingston, R.I., competing in the Moody Trophy regatta.
The Crimson only competed in one event rather than the typical two or three, as for the second weekend in a row, the women’s team did not compete, and the co-eds only sent out one squad to sail at the University of Rhode Island.
The Harvard co-eds found themselves in a particularly unusual situation this past weekend. With the main sailors of the co-ed team taking the weekend off, the Moody Trophy regatta featured mostly collegiate sailing newcomers. Four of the five Crimson sailors that competed are freshmen.
“Having mostly freshmen compete shows how much faith and trust the rest of the team and the coaches have in us and our abilities,” freshman Gram Slattery said. “Being able to compete against opponents at such a high level will only make us better sailors in the future.”
The team would go on to a last-place finish out of the field of 18 schools. But with the more experienced members of the squad not competing this weekend, the freshmen saw this as an opportunity to not only gain experience on the collegiate level but also a way to prove themselves as competitive and capable sailors in a top regatta.
“This is the first time that we’ve competed in such a major regatta without having our seniors to take charge,” Slattery said. “Usually we have [captain] Brendan [Kopp] and Sarah [Pierson] sail for our A-division, and Emily [Lambert] and Alex [Jumper] for the B, but having mostly freshmen compete this time was a great experience.”
In the A-division, the freshman duo of Gram Slattery and Brian Drumm teamed up for the second time this season, as the two captured two top-10 finishes out of nine races on their way to a 16th-place finish with 120 points.
The B-division sailors also finished the weekend with 120 points of their own, as a combination of four Harvard sailors contributed to the effort. Freshman Olenka Polak made her debut for the Crimson, competing in her first regatta of the season. Classmate Richard Bergsund skippered the first eight races in the B-division for Harvard, while Drumm took over the skippering duties for the ninth and final race of the weekend. Senior and Crimson editor William White was the only non-freshman to compete in the Moody Trophy regatta, as he and Polak served as crew for the B-division.
“It’s always our goal to try to win, regardless of if we have our very best combinations of sailors out there or if it’s two of us that have never sailed together in a regatta before,” Bergsund said. “The fact that we managed to get a second- and third-place finish is great for us, because success against this type of competition means that we can sail at this level.”
The B-division squad did see a bit more success in individual races than its A-division counterparts did, as Bergsund and Polak grabbed a third-place finish in the second race of the regatta and their second race working together as a skipper and crew. Drumm and White had the highest finish of any Harvard pairing in a single race on the weekend, taking home a second-place finish in the very last race of the regatta.
Despite seeing success with top top-three finishes in two of its nine races, the B-division Crimson contingent finished in last place in its division, matching the point total of Harvard’s A-division sailors.
The Hawks of Roger Williams University claimed the Moody Trophy and an overall first-place finish with a total of 99 points, with the Tufts University Jumbos in a close second place, only four points behind. Ivy League rivals Yale came in third place in the regatta with 112 points.
The Crimson will start off the second half of its season next weekend, competing in two Ancient Eight venues. The co-ed squad travels north to Dartmouth to sail in the Captain Hurst Bowl, while the women’s team will see its first action in three weeks as it heads to Yale to compete in the Yale Women’s Intersectional.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
In this edition of “Where Are They Now,” our focus continues to be on Ryan Fitzpatrick '05. Fitzpatrick and the Buffalo Bills played host to Michael Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday at Ralph Wilson Stadium.
Following last weekend’s disappointing three-point loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, the Bills had hoped to recover in their matchup against Philadelphia.
The Bills didn’t seem to be intimidated by the once-touted “Dream Team,” as Fitzpatrick and Co. put up 21 points on the board in the first half. In the second quarter, the Harvard alum capped a 77-yard drive by connecting with wideout David Nelson for his only touchdown of the day. Buffalo never looked back and earned itself a 31-24 victory.
Fitzpatrick finished the day with 193 passing yards, the lowest total of his 2011 breakout season. The drop-off was due in part to the Buffalo running game. The Eagles had no answer for Bills running back Fred Jackson, who ran the ball 26 times and finished with 111 yards on the ground
Buffalo’s typically weak defense made great strides in Sunday’s matchup. The Bills harassed Michael Vick throughout the contest, forcing the four-time Pro Bowler to throw four interceptions.
Following Sunday’s victory over the Eagles, Buffalo moved to 4-1 and remained atop the AFC East. The squad will hit the gridiron again next week in a Cinderella matchup with QB Rex Grossman and the 3-1 Washington Redskins.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a win at Brown (5-11, 1-4 Ivy) on Friday, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (9-6, 2-3) ended its two-game winning streak in a loss at Yale (11-4, 5-0) on Saturday. The victory against the Bears marked the Crimson’s first match in Ancient Eight play this year that didn’t need to be pushed into a fifth set.
“Sometimes you don’t know what to expect from [Brown],” co-captain Christine Wu said. “When we lost that third game, we [thought] let’s get it together, let’s get back into the system and let’s take control of the set … This is our game, let’s finish it now. We shouldn’t have to go to five to win this match.”
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard headed to New Haven to take on the Bulldogs, the undefeated first-place team in the Ivy League, only to fall in straight sets, 25-17, 25-21, 25-20.
“We just didn’t respond as well,” Wu said. “Even though they are a young team, they have a lot of great attackers, and their defense is pretty solidified.”
Yale outperformed the Crimson .306 to .183 in hitting percentage, 66 to 55 in digs, five to zero in blocks, and six to three in aces. Junior outside hitter Taylor Docter tallied 12 kills and a .324 hitting percentage on the night. Sophomore setter Natalie Doyle contributed 33 assists and 10 digs, earning her fourth straight double-double. Wu added 18 digs.
The Crimson trailed, 11-6, at the beginning of the first set. Harvard brought down the deficit to two points, 17-15, but the host kept its lead and came out on top, 25-17.
In the second set, the Bulldogs opened with another lead and maintained it throughout the entire set. The Crimson worked its way up after trailing by seven to come within two points again, 22-20, but the visitors couldn’t finish its comeback, as Yale finished the set, 25-21.
The Bulldogs came out strong yet again in the third, scoring three straight points to extend its lead, 11-6. Another three-point run increased Yale’s advantage to 17-11, and the Bulldogs never looked back. The Ivy leaders closed out the match, 25-20, remaining undefeated in the conference.
“Yale is a very good offensive and defensive team, and it was just hard for us to respond well to that,” Wu said. “But, even with the loss, we saw a lot of good things that we did that we can capitalize on and a lot of other things that we also need to work on.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
In its first victory that didn’t require five sets, Harvard defeated Brown 25-22, 25-17, 17-25, and 25-22.
The Crimson led the opening set of the match with a small lead of 8-7, but Docter hit two kills to set a 4-0 run into motion, setting the score at 12-7. After a 4-1 stretch, Harvard sailed ahead again to 19-14. Freshman outside hitter Kristen Casey ended the game with a kill, 25-22.
“We played pretty well and stayed in our system,” Casey said.
The Bears began the second set with an early 2-0 lead, but the Crimson got control of the ball and took the lead for the rest of the game, scoring four of the final five points to win, 25-17. Sophomore right side Erin Cooney delivered the final hit, and Casey contributed eight kills in the frame with a .462 hitting percentage.
In the third set, Brown showed the Crimson that it was not finished yet, coming out with a 25-17 victory.
Harvard rebounded in the fourth set after a neck-in-neck game, bringing the score to a tie at 16. After a 5-0 run that left the Crimson with a cushioned lead at 21-16, Harvard kept the Bears from pushing the match to five sets with a match point by Casey—her fifth kill of the set—putting the Crimson on top at 25-22.
Docter featured in the match, posting 15 kills and a .359 hit percentage. Doyle recorded 40 assists and 15 digs, and Wu contributed 26 digs. Casey ended the night with 12 digs and a season-high 21 kills, earning her second straight double-double and fifth of the year.
Despite splitting the weekend, Harvard was pleased with its progress.
“It was a good learning experience,” Wu said. “We know what to expect from them now, and hopefully we’ll be more ready to get them next time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A poll conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics has former Mass. Governor W. Mitt Romney leading the Republican presidential primary race in New Hampshire, with 38 percent of likely voters supporting him.
Romney leads in the state—traditionally the first state to hold presidential primaries—by 18 points, with businessman Herman Cain following at 20 percent and Texas Congressman Ron Paul at 13 percent.
The poll surveyed 648 likely voters and was conducted in partnership with Saint Anselm College, located in Manchester, N.H.
Romney, who graduated from Harvard with dual law and business degrees, is largely considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Despite his status as the front-runner, the Republican political field is still considered highly contested.
In the last few months, several candidates have arisen as potential competitors, including Texas Governor Rick Perry and Minnesota Congresswoman Michele M. Bachmann.
But in the poll, both Perry and Bachmann showed considerably weaker numbers than Romney, ranking sixth and seventh respectively.
IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 attributed Perry and Bachmann’s weak performance to their lack of campaigning in New Hampshire.
“The candidates certainly differ on tone and style, but they agree on most things. The fact that they’re viewed so unfavorably in New Hampshire is very telling,” Grayson said.
But Grayson also said Bachmann and Perry’s low numbers are indicative of a larger narrative, emphasizing that Republican voters are still uncertain about the Republican lineup.
“If we had done this poll a month ago, I would have assumed Perry would be a lot higher,” Grayson said. “But we’ve seen that he’s lost a lot of what he had in the early polls. The question is whether he’s up to speed on the issues.”
The poll is part of the IOP’s broader initiatives to prepare for the 2012 campaign, said IOP President Jeffrey F. Solnet ’12.
Solnet said the IOP is also in the midst of producing a student-led report on the “Millennial” generation’s views on the election and the state of the country.

The Harvard field hockey team fought hard in a nail-biter against Northeastern but ultimately fell, 1-0, at the Huskies’ Sweeney Field on Monday. The Crimson had a couple of chances to tie the game in the final minutes but was unable to find the equalizer.
The Crimson (6-5, 2-1 Ivy), coming off its first home loss and the end of a four-game winning streak after Saturday’s loss against Stanford, was looking to return to the win column against a formidable Northeastern team (9-5, 3-2 Colonial Athletic Association), who remains undefeated at home this year.
“We were really excited heading in [to the matchup],” co-captain Carly Dickson said. “We played really well against Stanford but didn’t get the result we wanted, so we were looking to get a little revenge on the weekend. People were really energetic going in, but our legs were a little tired.”
Behind a good defense and a great performance from goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos, Harvard was able to limit the host’s offense, which resulted in a closely-contested match.
“Our defense did a job today of limiting their opportunities in the circle,” co-captain Georgia McGillivray said. “They have some have some quick forwards, and we knew that going in, so we adjusted our defense to limit their ability to do anything in the circle.”
Tassopoulos ended up recording a season-high 18 saves.
“Cynthia was great as always,” McGillivray said. “She did a great job communicating to the defense so that everything was always taken care of on that end. She also had some great saves. They had a lot of shots coming in, and she had a lot of action back there, and she did really well.”
The Huskies got the only goal of the game when senior Kaela Barker put one past Tassopoulos off an assist by Northeastern junior Allison Conti about 25 minutes into the contest.
Neither team was able to score the rest of the half, as Tassopoulos and Huskies goalie Lizzie Priest shut down the opposing offenses with seven and four saves, respectively.
Northeastern had a great opportunity to increase its lead four minutes into the second half when the host put three shots on net within 30 seconds. But Tassopoulos was there to stop all the scoring opportunities, keeping the Crimson within striking distance to even the score.
The rest of the half was much the same, as neither team capitalized on its scoring chances.
With the score still set at 1-0, a late Harvard charge threatened to tie the game. The visitors dominated possession of the ball in the Huskies zone during the final minutes of the contest.
“The last three minutes, we were in their circle the entire time,” Dickson said. “We really were pushing for a tying goal, and [sophomore] Rachel Rosenfeld was really close [to scoring], but we were unlucky and unable to put it in.”
McGillivray also felt that the Crimson could have tied the game up.
“We had a big push into our offensive end, and we almost drew some penalty corners in the last minute,” McGillivray said. “But we came up short, which was too bad, but a good effort was there at the end.”
Despite the last-minute flurry, Northeastern’s defense was strong throughout the match, keeping the Harvard offense out of the zone and helping its attack outshoot the Crimson, 33-8, for the game.
It was quite a feat that Harvard remained so close throughout.
“[The Huskies] did a good job of blocking the circle limiting our scoring chances, and [Tassopoulos] had an unbelievable game—that is why we limited them to one goal,” Dickson said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t get it into the circle more.”
Harvard will look to rally next weekend and perform better in a conference matchup at Cornell. But first, the Crimson will look at its mistakes against Northeastern and try to fix them.
“We came out strong, and overall, we played really well,” McGillivray said. “A great opponent in Northeastern, and we always match up really well against them, especially this year.
“Our style is really similar to theirs, so we were able to match up really nicely with their players. We just needed more shots and more corners so we could score a goal.

Harvard Divinity School announced a $2.7 million donation last week to support the founding of The Buddhist Ministry Initiative, a program to foster the training of Buddhist ministers at the Divinity School.
The eight-year initiative will fund lectures and the development of coursework in Buddhist ministry studies, field education, and an international conference.
The donation, from The Robert H. N. Ho Family Foundation, is part of the foundation’s effort to increase Western engagement with Buddhist philosophy. The foundation also announced a $2.5 million donation to Stanford University for similar purposes.
Divinity School Associate Dean for Ministry Studies Dudley C. Rose said the new funds reflect the School’s commitment to expanding the breadth of its ministry programs.
“The Ho Family Foundation’s gift affords us extraordinary resources and opportunities to expand Buddhist ministry and further accomplish a central vision for ministry preparation at Harvard,” he wrote in a statement.
Divinity School Professor of Buddhist Studies Janet Gyatso said it is important to distinguish between the academic study of Buddhism at Harvard, which she said will be unaffected by the donation, and the program for training Buddhist ministers.
“We have a lot of courses in the academic study of Buddhism ... but there is also a ministry program,” she said. “The ministry program [at Harvard] has traditionally focused on teaching a learned ministry and teaching students who are not just going into ministry but are going into any socially engaged [profession].”
Gyatso said that the donation would offer ministry students expanded opportunities to receive funding for endeavors including field work in hospitals and prisons.
The program will also fund students’ international extracurricular work in the summer and support the Divinity School’s interaction with other institutions preparing Buddhist ministers.
“We are very happy to have new, significant funding from the Ho Family Foundation to undergird and expand our program to train leaders for Buddhist communities in North America,” said Divinity School Dean William A. Graham in a statement. He continued that the fund will improve “the ability for our students to gain experience in Buddhist-majority countries of Asia and for Asian Buddhist students to come to Cambridge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Athletics Department’s month-long billboard advertising campaign—in which three billboards were erected around Boston encouraging locals to attend Harvard football games—will begin wrapping up later this week, as the first of the billboards will be taken down.
The campaign represents a new effort by the Athletics Department to attract local residents to Harvard sporting events and familiarize them with the institution.
It is also the first time the department has used billboards for promotional purposes.
“Hopefully, these billboards are capturing people’s attention on their commutes, and this awareness will translate into increased attendance and greater exposure for Harvard football,” said Susan Byrne, Associate Director of Athletics for Sales and Marketing.
The three advertisements all feature an action shot of Josue G. Ortiz ’12, starting defensive tackle for Harvard football, along with a Harvard athletics shield and a banner for GoCrimson.com.
The first billboard was posted across from the Museum of Science, Boston along Monsignor O’Brien Highway during the week of Sept. 5. The second was posted the following week along Route 1A in Revere, Mass. The final billboard was installed the week of Sept. 19 along Western Avenue in Allston.
Each billboard was purchased for four weeks, but the advertisements will stay up longer if no one else buys the space.
The Athletics Department would not disclose the cost of the advertising campaign.
“We’ve always tried different methods of advertising—this year we wanted to try a different medium,” Byrne said. “This year, we’re doing more with social media as well, but I thought it would be worth a try to do more brand awareness in and around the city.”
Harvard football’s home-opener against Brown on Sept. 23 is the only game to have passed since the launch of the campaign, so it is too soon to assess the success of the advertisements, Byrne said.
However, Harvard head football coach Timothy L. Murphy said he has already seen a marked improvement in fan interest and enthusiasm.
“When I looked up in the stands at halftime of the Brown game, pouring rain the whole time, to see our side almost completely filled ... I think our people and our marketing department are doing a great job,” Murphy said.
Although the Athletics Department supports and funds all 41 varsity teams at Harvard, it only reserves advertising funds for the College’s six ticketed sports: men’s football, men’s and women’s hockey, men’s and women’s basketball, and men’s lacrosse. Byrne and the marketing office hope to employ similarly nontraditional methods to advertise the other ticketed teams in the future.
“It’s all about generating awareness and getting some nice publicity for the teams,” Byrne said. “It’s not all about the Patriots in Boston, it’s not all about Boston College—Harvard football and Harvard sports is a great experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day when the penalty corner was essential, the Harvard field hockey (6-4, 2-1 Ivy) team failed to draw enough fouls to defeat a tough Stanford squad (10-1, 3-0 NorPac).
The Crimson’s winning streak ended at four, as Harvard fell, 4-1, to the seventh-ranked Cardinal on Saturday in front of a sizeable crowd at Jordan Field.
Down two goals—both of which came off penalties—the hosts entered the second period gaining momentum and threatened to half the deficit with a penalty corner of its own.
But Stanford’s quickness from the goal thwarted the Crimson’s attempts to score, and soon afterwards, at the 49:49 mark, the Cardinal put one in the back of the net after a series of quick passes, giving it a three-goal advantage, which Harvard was unable to overcome.
“We were hoping to get more corners,” junior forward Emma Keller said. “We only drew two today. They move their feet. Their hands are low; sticks are down, so it was really hard to draw corners today. But we scored one out of two [penalty corners]. We’ve been working a lot on those.”
“I think we played very well,” Crimson coach Sue Caples said. “They’re a very strong team. We competed 70 minutes. It came down to speed of execution. I think we have to do some things a little sooner, and we got a little unlucky on defensive corners.”
Three out of the four goals Stanford scored came on the penalty corner, which showcased the speed the Cardinal had throughout the game.
“Their offensive penalty corners were really fast,” Keller noted. “They were great.”
The first half was a hard-fought battle, with Stanford pulling ahead with two goals on the penalty corner. Defender Becky Dru scored on a low hard blast to the left at the eight-minute mark, and defender Kelsey Lloyd put one in from the left goal post after two quick passes at 16:50.
“Sometimes you just get little deflections,” Caples said. “They had a rocket of a shot. We actually were anticipating more drag flicks, but we really didn’t see that. They just executed on corners, and those were well done.”
Keller had the lone goal for the Crimson on the day, scoring on a penalty corner at 58:25 on a tap-in by the left goal post.
“We ran a slant to Georgia, and I was inserting and went to the top,” said Keller. “[It was sent] over toward [sophomore] Rachael [Rosenfeld] for the shot. [She] tipped it, and it landed right it front of me, and I just popped it in.”
Dru topped off the scoring for the Cardinal near the end of the game at 67:33, with a very similar shot to her first goal.
Despite being outshot, 23-5, on the game, Harvard demonstrated the ability to put pressure on Stanford throughout.
“We’re pretty happy with everyone’s effort, especially on the press,” co-captain Carly Dickson said.  “The forwards did really well. We had a couple different presses we wanted to use on them, and they did a good job with all of them.”
“We did a great job pressing and transitioning seamlessly,” Caples added. “It was impressive. We think of a press as being attack-oriented, and we did a great job in the organization of that.”
Although the Crimson executed the press well, the Cardinal was able to use its speed to thwart almost every opportunity Harvard was building, especially near the net.
“We need to be able to penetrate the circle and get some more shots or at least draw some corners,” Caples said. “Those were tough to come by for us today.”
“Their flat-stick tackles are great,” Dickson added. “They’re very solid on defense, [and] they have good positioning.”
Goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos made eight saves on the day, keeping the Crimson in it for most of the game.
“Cyn was as ever rock solid in the goal cage,” Caples said.
With Stanford being probably one of the best teams Harvard will face all year, the team was proud with its performance against the seventh-ranked team in the nation, and it hopes to use this tough matchup as a building block for the rest of the season.
“We did more than hang in there,” Caples said. “We competed. We played with them … These are the ones you love to play to see how you measure up.”
“We like playing these types of games because it picks up our level of speed and our level of play,” Keller said. “When you play a tough team like this, it brings out the best in you.”
We were tested and we tested them and we’re a better team after today. But now what do we do, what’s next, and that’s exciting to see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the past weeks, Harvard co-captain Melanie Baskind and freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby have provided the “go-to” force for the Crimson women’s soccer team (7-4-1, 2-0-1 Ivy), taking team-leading 37 and 33 shots, respectively, this season.
But at Cornell (2-9-1, 0-2-1) on Saturday, Harvard relied on the duo of junior Aisha Price and sophomore Elizabeth Weisman to carry the team to a 2-2 tie and keep the Crimson at the top of the Ivy League rankings.
“I think it was a game that could have gone either way,” Baskind said. “We’re disappointed because it’s an Ivy League game, and every one of those is very important … But we can’t be too upset with the tie. We have to go back to the drawing board in some ways and see how we can continue to improve for the next game.”
Saturday’s contest started with a scoreless first half that soon turned into a game of cat and mouse in the second 45 minutes. All four goals took place in the last 17 minutes of the match, as each time Harvard scored, Cornell quickly responded.
Price put the Crimson on the board first, heading in a goal off a corner kick by co-captain Lindsey Kowal in the 73rd minute.
Winless in the Ancient Eight coming into today’s game, the Big Red refused to let a win slip away. Only 16 seconds after Price’s header, co-captain Abigail Apistolas scored for Cornell to tie the game. Apistolas’ goal was the first time the Big Red scored against Harvard since Oct. 9, 2004.
“I’m pleased with how we responded because a lot of teams, when you let something slip by you like that, you’re so down that you can’t even turn it around,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “But we did. Again give credit to Cornell. We didn’t go away, and they didn’t either.”
Harvard continued to attack, taking a total 19 shots compared to Cornell’s nine, but Big Red goaltender Megan Bartlett remained impassable, making six saves overall. Dangerous shots by Baskind and sophomore Erika Garcia fueled the Crimson offense, as did Harvard’s 6-2 advantage in corner kicks.
Cornell’s offense provided some heart pains for Crimson fans as well, including a powerful shot by Big Red freshman Kerry Schubert. But Harvard goaltender Bethany Kanten, in her third Ivy appearance, made five saves throughout the match. Halfway through the Ivy season, the rookie holds a 1.25 goals-against average and has turned aside 22 shots overall.
“She stepped up,” said Baskind, referring to Kanten. “She’s gaining confidence with each game. She has a really great supporting cast, [and all four goalies] are continuing to learn from each other. We have confidence with whoever is in the net.”
It wasn’t until 84:12 that the Crimson put another point on the board. Price took advantage of teammate Weisman’s wide-open position, sending her a pass that the sophomore easily converted to put Harvard up, 2-1.
But with 1:42 left in the game, Cornell’s Maneesha Chitanvis hammered in a pass from Apistolas past Kanten, tying the game yet again for the Big Red.
“Being ahead twice and letting up a goal right after each time was just a total lapse in concentration, and we paid for it,” Leone said. “Once we got ourselves into [overtime], we played well, even more so than the rest of the game.”
The Crimson outplayed the aggressor in overtime, repeatedly attacking the goal with shots and Price’s well-known long-range throw-ins. But a scoreless 15 minutes provided the Ivy League with its first tie of the season.
“We played our best soccer in overtime,” Baskind said. “Cornell had the momentum before that, scoring a big goal with only one minute to go, so I was proud of the way we responded. We had some chances, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out for us.”
Harvard plays Sienna on Tuesday in its last non-conference game before facing four Ancient Eight opponents to end the regular season.
“[We’re going to be] trying to get back to what we do well: trying to posess the ball and move the ball a little better than we’ve been moving it,” Leone said. “[We’re] trying to recapture that focus again, and then it’s a run to the finish after that. It’s an open field in the Ivy League, and anything can happen, so we’re excited.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With $12 million pledged towards investments in energy efficiency, Harvard University currently leads the pack in the Billion Dollar Green Challenge.
Launched today by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, the initiative challenges colleges and universities to collectively raise $1 billion towards low-emission technologies.
To date, 33 institutions—including Dartmouth and Stanford Universities—have committed a total of roughly $65 million.
“We’re transforming energy efficiency upgrades from perceived expenses to high-return investment opportunities,” said Mark Orlowski, founder and executive director of the Sustainable Endowments Institute, in a press release.
The University’s $12 million Green Campus Loan Fund, first established in the 1990s, grants loans of up to $500,000 for energy conservation projects to each of Harvard’s schools.
“Harvard is at the forefront to show that energy conservation should be funded,” said Heather A. Henriksen, director of Harvard’s Office for Sustainability, which manages the funds.
Orlowski said that funds such as the Green Campus Loan Fund are revolving, meaning that a portion of the returns will replenish the money withdrawn. For example, Harvard has seen about 30 percent yearly returns on the fund for the last decade, he said.
While he lauded the University for their contributions, Orlowski added that Harvard might consider “further expanding” their financial commitments to green technology.
“Harvard has 25 million square feet of building, and 12 million dollars is good but can only stretch so far,” he said. “Think about how old these [Harvard] buildings are. Think about how old the lighting is.”
Orlowski cited Weber State University’s pledge of $9 million—the third-largest contribution to the Challenge—as an example of a school that has devoted significant financial resources towards energy efficiency.
Henriksen maintained that Harvard’s fund—both the largest and oldest green fund amongst universities—speaks for the University’s commitment to sustainability.
She added that the office may contribute some of the funds to energy conservation projects with longer paybacks, greater payoffs, and higher costs in the future.
“We are still in an evolutionary period,” Henriksen said. “We have learned so much from the past 10 years and we can evolve even further.”
Beyond funding, Harvard has played another leadership role in the Challenge by helping other schools set up similar funds, Orlowski said.
“We are learning from existing revolving funds, not reinventing them,” he said. “Harvard has been very generous in helping and assisting other schools.”
He added that Harvard’s fund also demonstrates that green initiatives can also be economically savvy.
“This fund has been great proof of how doing good by the environment also does well economically,” Orlowski said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its home-opening weekend, the Harvard men’s water polo team hosted a pair of conference rivals at Blodgett Pool but could not take full advantage of its home-team advantage. The Crimson (4-9, 0-4 CWPA) lost to cross-town rival MIT (6-12, 2-2) on Friday night, 8-4, before falling to Brown (6-4, 2-1), 11-4, on Saturday afternoon, leaving the squad winless in its first four games of conference play.
BROWN 11, HARVARD 4
Reeling from a loss in its home opener the night before, Harvard welcomed Brown for its second game of the weekend.
Despite a positive defensive showing from the Crimson, Harvard failed to execute on offense consistently, and Brown rode on an excellent performance from junior Svetozar Stefanovic to victory, 11-4.
“We turned the ball over way too much,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “We did some good things … but we have got to do a better job of putting the ball away.”
Brown opened the game with a goal in its first possession and continued to be the stronger of the two teams offensively in the first quarter, jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the opening minutes. While Harvard hit the crossbar three times in the first period, its execution in its passing game was inconsistent, and the Crimson failed to find open shots.
Harvard would get a goal back seconds before the end of the first period, as sophomore Will Roller stole the ball and began a counter attack.
With three seconds left before the whistle, freshman John Holland-McCowan unleashed a low backhand shot from the far left of the pool that seemed to take Brown goalie Walker Shockley by surprise.
Play was even throughout much of the second and third periods. The Crimson managed to convert its first six-on-five goal of the weekend in the second period, and goalie Jimmy Field made two saves in Brown’s one-on-one opportunities.
But the squad could not cut into the lead Brown had established early in the game.
Stefanovic proved difficult to guard for the Harvard defenders. The junior tallied six goals and two assists on the day and seemed to be scoring or creating goals for his teammates every time he touched the ball.
Stefanovic also grabbed six steals, dominating the game on both sides of the ball.
The Crimson’s execution troubles continued into the final period of the game, as Brown kept Harvard scoreless in the fourth, despite numerous six-on-five opportunities.
After the game, Holland-McCowan had faith in his team to rise above its execution troubles going forward.
“When we executed the game plan, we played well,” the freshman said. “We need to go into these next few weeks knowing that we are a good team and can continue to grow and progress in that area.”
MIT 8, HARVARD 4
For any fan walking into Blodgett Pool for the Harvard men’s water polo home opener, it might have been difficult to decide which team was actually the host. MIT fans filled the stands and unleashed loud and continuous cheers, as their team pushed on for an 8-4 victory in an energetic and physical game.
The Crimson opened its season with a 13-5 victory against the Engineers a month ago, but junior two-meter Max Eliot knew that result would be tough to match.
“We knew [MIT was] going to come out fired up,” Eliot said. “We came into [the game] with a fresh mindset. We just did not do what we needed to do [Saturday], and it showed.”
With senior goalie Alex Popp out for at least another week with an elbow ligament injury, Field started in between the posts this weekend. Field and the Crimson defense began the game strongly, with the goalie notching some impressive saves.
But the Engineers scored two goals, while Harvard struggled offensively. Eliot registered numerous shots off weak passes but could not beat MIT goalie Columbus Leonard. The senior provided the Engineers with crucial saves all game and stifled many of the Crimson’s attacks.
While the first half remained relatively even, MIT came into the third period firing. Sophomore attacker Andrew Dorne scored four times in just over two minutes of game time, and the Engineers jumped to a huge lead, 8-2.
“I think we were getting frustrated with our offense, and we were not focused on defense,” Eliot said. “We let our defensive mistakes kill us in [the third] quarter.”
Harvard searched for an answer to this streak and a way back into the game. Co-captains Kevin DiSilvestro and Luka Babic orchestrated a counter attack that led to a goal just before the end of the third period. But MIT would remain defensively strong in the fourth period, as the visitors ran out the clock and claimed the victory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Exactly one year ago, Sophy T. Lee ’12 changed her Facebook status to “Yep, I’m gay.”
On last year’s “National Coming Out Day,” Lee’s new Facebook status update generated 25 comments and 40 “likes.”
“I got a lot of congrats, which was strange,” she says. “I didn’t know what I was being congratulated for.”
Lee says that the first few conversations, in which she came out to her peers, were awkward.
“There were a lot of ‘ums,’” she says.
Despite her initial discomfort and fear of discrimination, she says that everyone she told at Harvard supported her.
Though the BGLTQ community at large continues to struggle with homophobia and bullying, Lee says Harvard offered her an environment where she felt safe coming out and being open about her sexuality.
Other queer students echo Lee’s sentiments about the BGLTQ-friendly Harvard community, although a few add that occasional incidents of homophobia still occur on campus and perhaps contribute to the lingering fears of closeted students.
“VERY VERY GAY”
Jessica, a member of the Class of 2015 who identifies as lesbian and asked that her last name not be used, also saw Facebook as a tool to help her come out to her peers.
Jessica says she did not explicitly reveal her sexuality, but instead casually mentioned her girlfriend in a Facebook message to her roommates.
“I knew they were cool with it because one of my roommates would post really pro-homosexual things on her Facebook,” she says.
Jessica also found that peers in her entryway accepted her as well.
“Its interesting because it’s created a lot of conversations about sexuality,” she says.
Jessica’s experiences are similar to those of other BGLTQ-identified students at Harvard.
“Everyone jokes that Harvard is very very gay,” says Philip de Sa e Silva ’13. “And definitely, compared to my high school, it is.”
De Sa e Silva says that in high school, he did not feel as though coming out was beneficial to him, so he waited until his first year at Harvard to come out.
“[At Harvard] there are a lot of people who are out and older. And that helps,” he says.
Jessica, who is from Massachusetts—a place in which she says it is easy to be gay—was surprised that her peers at Harvard accepted her as quickly as they did, since they came from a variety of communities and represented families with a range of religious and political convictions.
“I had my own prejudices,” she says.
Jessica says she was surprised that students who said they were devout did not discriminate against her for being lesbian.
“I have a friend who is Catholic and he came up to me and said, ‘You know Catholic people, we’re cool with the gays,’” she recalls.
HARVARD DOES QUEER
Head Teaching Fellow for English 154: “Literature and Sexuality” and a non-resident tutor in Lowell House, Robert Joseph “R.J.” Jenkins says that while Harvard offers a positive environment for queer students, homophobia still exists on campus.
“I think the danger we’re in is the danger of thinking that because we’re at Harvard, because we’re in a liberal environment, because we’re in the northeast, everyone is accepting,” says Jenkins, who is openly gay.
De Sa e Silva recalls a night when he was returning to his dorm room in DeWolfe from a party in the Quad. As he rode the shuttle, he says he remembers hearing a boy behind him yell homophobic slurs at one of his friends—something de Sa e Silva had not heard since high school.
“He was calling someone a fag or something like that,” he says. “I just felt so tense.”
Some people, like Katherine M. Baus ’15, say Harvard is still a heteronormative environment.
Baus, who identifies as bisexual, says she does not think events during freshman orientation address the needs of queer students.
“The comedy shows—the stand up—are exclusively, exclusively heterosexual and it would be nice to see some sort of representation there,” she says.
She adds that while there is an additional “Sex Signals” performance for BGLTQ-identified students, she thinks the programming is inadequate.
“[The BGLTQ followup] sort of sucks because you have to be out if you want to go to it,” she says.
Jenkins—who has been at Harvard for seven years—says the administration has been taking measures to create a supportive environment for queer students.
“I’ve been pretty encouraged by what seems to be to be a reinvigorated conversation about how we support this community,” Jenkins says.
But, he stipulates that it is important for Harvard to create a safe environment for people who have not yet come out. He also warns about the danger of homophobic language and discriminatory practices.
“While [homophobic] words are unacceptable to begin with, you may be committing a type of violence against someone you care about,” he says.
A SKEWED VIEW
De Sa e Silva says that he does not think being gay at Harvard accurately represents the broader public’s perspective on the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community—meaning students must face different perceptions when they return home.
“I think Harvard gives me a skewed view of how accepting people are, maybe because the queer community here is so visible and I think fairly accepted,” he says.
Hannah, a member of the Class of 2015 who identifies as bisexual, says she is not active in BGLTQ groups on campus because she does not want her sexuality to define her.
Hannah, whose name has been changed to protect her identity because of the sensitive nature of the topic, says she fears that people will discriminate against her if she is too open about being bisexual. She says that despite the existence of queer-straight alliances, there is still a lot of discrimination against the BGLTQ community outside of Harvard, especially in places like Texas—where Hannah is from.
“Depending on what kind of job I have, I probably will not fully come out,” she says. “It could cause some strangeness.”
For students such as Hannah, coming out to their families might be more difficult than coming out on campus.
Aside from telling her brother she is bisexual, Hannah has not come out to her family, which she describes as conservative and Hispanic.
“People in Texas are generally more conservative, and especially Hispanic parents can be pretty conservative, so I think that really influences their decision making and their thoughts on gayness,” she says.
Hannah adds that before arriving at Harvard, she felt ashamed of her sexuality due to the religious teachings of her grandparents and other family members.
In elementary school, Hannah had crushes on other girls, but didn’t talk about it with others because she knew it conflicted with her grandparents’ teachings.
“I became quite religious and I felt awkward within myself,” Hannah says.
Lee says her parents are the only people who reacted negatively when she came out to them. Describing the moment when she told her parents she was a lesbian, Lee remembers that her hands were shaking because she feared their reaction.
“My dad was in denial,” she says.
Lee remembers that her parents would tell her several times, “We don’t believe you’re gay.”
Despite how they act, though, Lee says her family remains important to her.
“I love them more than anything else in the world and I know I always will,” she says.
IT’S PERSONAL
Both Lee and de Sa e Silva say the biggest advantage of coming out at Harvard was the boost in self-confidence.
De Sa e Silva says that coming out allowed him to be less self-conscious than he had been when he was closeted.
“It wasn’t like first I was Philip and then I was gay Philip after that,” he says. “I was just part of me before, and then I came out and I was able to be all of me after.”
Lee says that before coming out, she conformed to gendered ideals. She says social norms dictated what she chose to talk about with her friends, who she chose to dance with at parties, and even the classes in which she chose to enroll.
“I acted the way people wanted me to act,” she says.
After she came out, Lee says she became a more confident person.
“I saw myself more clearly,” she says. “And I took classes I actually liked.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small group of 20 students and community members gathered outside Matthews Hall on Monday evening to reflect on the history of Columbus Day and honor the lives that were lost as a result of colonialism.
The event, organized by Native Americans at Harvard College (NAHC), was held on the site where Harvard’s Indian College once stood.
“It’s just here to serve as a commemoration for Columbus Day,” NAHC President Tia M. Ray ’12 said of the event. “We use this as a way to share our own experiences. It’s not meant to be an attack on Columbus Day.”
Ray spoke at the event while those gathered around her lit candles.
“For me, this is a day of mourning but also a day of celebration,” she said.
Ray also took time to mention the Wampanoag American Indian tribe, who are native to this part of Massachusetts.
“Their struggles were the struggles of many people on this continent,” she said.
Event co-coordinator April A. Sperry ’13 echoed Ray, stressing the positive message of the event.
“We’re not hating on the day,” Sperry said. “We are here to just remember what was instead of to be angry.”
In advertising for the event, NAHC cited the fact that other Ivy League universities have renamed Columbus Day a neutral fall-themed weekend.
But Ray said that NAHC had no plans to advocate for such change at Harvard.
“Institutions are pretty resistant to change,” she said.
While Columbus Day this year passed without incident, the Sigma Chi fraternity received criticism last year for their controversial “Conquistabros and Navajos” themed party.
Sperry says the majority of negative feedback came from the national press rather than Harvard student groups.
“[Sigma Chi] sent us a note of apology,” said Sperry, the social co-chair of NAHC. “It’s been pretty quiet this year.”
Reed R. Snyder ’15 and Zach L. Walters ’15, both residents of Matthews Hall, enjoyed the day’s last rays of sunshine with friends about 15 feet away from the vigil. Snyder, Walter, and their friends did not know what the quietly huddled group outside their dormitory was up to.
“I think it’s narrow minded to look at the situation because yes, as a whole Europe had a negative effect on Native culture, but I think it’s ... hypersensitivity, that’s what I’ll use,” said Reed, when asked about his views on the holiday. “It’s not about celebrating European colonization and domination of the Americas. It’s celebrating [Columbus’s] exploration and quest for discovery.”
For Walters, the situation is not so black and white.
“It’s tough to say because Columbus didn’t actually discover America. It’s a good day to relax and hang out with friends,” he said. “I think it’s a poorly titled holiday.”

In the wake of Apple CEO Steve Jobs’ death, the innovator’s first authorized biography, written by Harvard Overseer Walter S. Isaacson ’74 and scheduled to debut on October 24, has become the most popular pre-ordered book on Amazon.com and BarnesandNoble.com.
Jobs—who died last Wednesday of complications from pancreatic cancer at age 56—first approached Isaacson to write the book roughly two years ago. Isaacson is well known for his best-selling biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein, and joked in a TIME Magazine memorial that he wondered if Jobs saw himself as the “natural successor in that sequence.”
Sony Pictures has already purchased the film rights to the book, which will be released almost a month earlier than anticipated since publisher Simon & Schuster has moved up the biography’s release date.
Computer Science Professor Eddie Kohler said he believes the public reaction to Jobs’ death is reflective of his enormous impact on the technology world.
He added that the recent surge of interest in Jobs’ life is “not to cash in [on Jobs’ death],” he said, “but to be inspired by his legacy.”
Simon & Schuster has advertised the book as an “unvarnished view” of Jobs’ life, writing in the preview on Amazon.com that Jobs asked for no control over what Isaacson wrote.
Isaacson recently wrote in TIME that a few weeks before Jobs’ death, he asked Isaacson over to his Palo Alto home and told him that his motivation for authorizing the biography was to document his life for his four children.
“I wanted my kids to know me,” Jobs told Isaacson, the CEO of the Aspen Institute and a former TIME managing editor. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.”
Kohler said that he was not necessarily convinced that this sentimental anecdote was representative of the importance of Jobs’ life and work.
“It’s obvious that his work life was what was important to him,” he said, “Maybe he died too young for his kids to be able to talk about it with him.”
Some suggest that Jobs is a dualistic figure—both an innovator and a capitalist—but Kohler criticized that perspective.
“There weren’t two Steve Jobs: the good Steve Jobs who created products and the evil one who sold them,” Kohler said, adding that Jobs was “totally willing to use his image to sell his vision.”
Computer Science Professor James H. Waldo expressed doubts that the biography would have any major impact on how people see Jobs in the future.
“Our image of him today is still wrapped up in what he did at Apple. We won’t know his true legacy for five years,” Waldo said.
He went on to say that while the media can “try to capitalize” on public grief over Jobs’ death, its impact would ultimately be limited.
“The legacy is what it is, and the legacy will stand on its own,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council launched “H-Square.org,” a centralized website through which students may access all Harvard-related websites and web initiatives, on Tuesday morning.
Comprised of two main sections, the website will highlight UC programs—such as UC Taxis and EventPlease—as well as other Harvard online resources, including shuttle schedules, my.harvard, CS50 blogs, “Harvard FML,” and more.
By compiling all the resources that Harvard has to offer on one central site, the Council hopes to provide students with a more organized and user-friendly search experience that doesn’t clutter their bookmarks.
“When people are searching for something Harvard related it can be a very disjointed process,” said UC Vice President Bonnie Cao ’12. “So our goal was to provide students with one central location where they could go to get access to all things Harvard.”
The website will also be used as a launch pad for the latest Harvard web apps, such as H-food.org—a new resource through which students can gain access to information about the dining halls by receiving texts, tweets, and Facebook updates.
“Our main goal is that this site will become a solid, long-term resource for the Harvard student body,” Cao said.
While the UC provided the vision for the H-Square website, the Council used an application process to hire a web developer and web designer in order to ensure the best product.
According to Cao, the launch date has also been pushed back several times in an effort to debut the site in its most flawless and user-friendly form.
“It won’t be something that we expect to jump to Facebook status, but hopefully it will get a lot of user traffic and become a lasting resource,” Cao said.
UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 echoed Cao’s enthusiasm.
“It has been a long term goal of ours to bring Harvard into the 21st century,” he said. “Now, as we celebrate 375 years of Harvard, it is as good a time as any.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Missed the “Smile, your mom chose life!” posters around the Yard last week? Thanks to some of your fellow classmates, probably so. Just as regular as the descent of midterm season in October is the tearing down of Harvard Right to Life’s posters every time pro-life students attempt to share their message of life with the campus. In 2008, HRL’s Cemetery of the Unborn in front of the Science Center was even vandalized. The posters have been consistently ripped down for years, going back far longer than any undergraduate has been on this campus, with barely a protest from most students and the administration.
Imagine your own student group’s posters and fliers being ripped down across campus, not just once but every time for many years. It’s downright shameful. On a campus known for its diversity, but this action reveals the sad truth that diversity of opinion is oftentimes not welcomed and the sadder truth that someone does not respect life.  Why doesn’t HRL deserve the freedom of expression? According to the Crimson archives, past students have criticized the poster campaigns because they “really create an uncomfortable atmosphere” and “irritate pro-choice supporters on campus.” It seems rather odd that posters seeking to persuade parents to choose life would infuriate students who state that they support a woman’s right to choose. Consistently attacking and silencing the pro-life message is pro-choice only if the choice is death.
The actions taken at Harvard have been mirrored those of the Obama administration. In August 2010, the Department of Justice and FBI co-sponsored a training event with the National Abortion Federation, the Feminist Majority Federation, and Planned Parenthood on violence against abortion providers. The Resource Guide distributed at the conference listed “the use of huge anti-abortion posters” and “boycotts against abortion providers” as past examples of “clinic violence.” Statistics used in the publication include “picketing” as a “violent incident.” This is obviously ridiculous. Unfortunately, the administration and its pro-abortion allies believe it.
Having defined peaceful protests as acts of violence, the Obama administration has wasted no time in taking legal action against individuals attempting to ensure that mothers make the most informed choice. Dick Retta, a 79-year-old pro-life sidewalk counselor in Washington, D.C., was sued in July by the Obama administration for being “one of the most vocal and aggressive anti-abortion protestors” and blocking access to the clinic, a charge he flatly denies. The administration has declined to prosecute the multiple Planned Parenthood escorts who have pushed him aside to prevent him from talking with parents and one abortion advocate who sprayed him with pepper spray.
On the 38th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, President Obama stated that the decision “affirms a fundamental principle: that government should not intrude on private family matters.” Meanwhile, his administration has “intruded” on the rights of all individuals who seek to ensure that parents make the best decision. Dick Retta and Harvard Right to Life have done nothing to impede women from aborting their children. All they seek to do is ensure that they make the most informed choice possible, because abortion is not a procedure that destroys a few insignificant cells. It is a procedure that kills a fetus that just so happens to grow into a human because it is human. When society defines human life based on a number of cells, it is impossible to determine and prove which number of cells is significant, perhaps explaining Obama’s confusion over his support of infanticide. Furthermore, the pro-life movement also seeks to educate women about the negative consequences of abortion. Sociologists at the University of Austin-Texas and the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill have found that, controlling for a variety of factors, “abortion may contribute to depression in emerging adulthood.”
For revealing these facts, the pro-life movement has been demonized and persecuted, and their persecution reveals the very nature of a Democratic Party that believes that abortion on demand is a human right. It is a movement that believes abortion is a good for society and silences those who would argue otherwise, and it is evil. Being unwanted or less than perfect should not be a crime worthy of the death penalty. Instead, it is a sad reflection of the extent to which society has degraded the most transcendent of all rights: the right to life, without which all other rights are irrelevant. As Rep. Paul Ryan has argued, “The freedom to choose is pointless for someone who does not have the freedom to live.”
So, the next time you see a Harvard Right to Life poster gracing the Yard, respect the diversity of opinion on this campus. Appreciate the diversity of life. And smile, because your mom chose life!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first step is admitting you have a problem.  What comes next, though, is figuring out precisely what that problem is and what to do about it. When it comes to drinking at Harvard, this is where most people get caught up. Christian A. Rivera’s recent column in The Crimson is just the latest example of how drunken logic leads one to the wrong conclusion that, because Harvard underclassmen already drink dangerously, making alcohol more available by lowering the drinking age would only cause them to drink more dangerously.
To be fair, Rivera is correct that alcohol is probably over-consumed at colleges in general and at Harvard in particular, and he’s right that a lot of students drink with the goal of getting drunk. But let’s be clear: no one’s goal is to end up in Stillman Infirmary, and when this does occur, it’s because students drink more than they intended to at the start of the night.
There are two separate problems then: First, students want to drink more than what is healthy, and second, students often wind up drinking even more than they intended to.  The first problem pertains to long-term student health, and the second pertains to short-term student safety. Making students healthy in the long term is certainly a legitimate goal, but it is not generally the main subject of discussions about drinking at Harvard; these conversations usually come back to student safety, and so I will focus on the second problem.
Rivera writes, “If you and a group of friends wanted to drink and were on a college budget, would you go to a bar that has $7+ drinks or go buy [a] $15 handle of cheap vodka and a two-liter Diet Coke?” Besides slightly overestimating the cost of a drink and questionably suggesting that a student should buy vodka—not rum—to mix with Diet Coke, Rivera is mostly on point here.
Indeed, the behavior that Rivera describes (what is often called “pregaming”) is risky for a few reasons. First, students pour their own drinks, which means these beverages tend to be very strong. Second, students are able to consume many beverages in a relatively short amount of time. But most importantly, pregames are potentially dangerous because drinks have no marginal cost in this setting. Students must buy alcohol and mixers, but once these transactions are made, pregaming is an all-you-can-drink buffet.
Where Rivera—and the many people who make similar arguments—go wrong, though, is assuming that pregaming is the most dangerous aspect of a student's drinking habits. Rivera says, “The end result of lowering the drinking age would not be more and safer parties that would stop students from pregaming, but more reckless pregaming.” People who harp on the dangers of pregaming miss the fundamental point that drinking at Harvard parties is more dangerous than pregaming simply because parties (by definition) come after pregames. Indeed the same factors that make pregaming dangerous—inexperienced bar tenders pouring strong drinks, drinking quickly, and drinks having no marginal cost—are present at parties as well. Drinking leads to bad outcomes when students drink more than they intended to, and in this respect, we should be focused on where students consume their last drinks of the night.
Rivera argues, in essence, that because it is not feasible on a college budget for a student whose goal is to get drunk to consume all of his or her alcohol at a bar, pregaming would still be popular even if the drinking age were 18, and thus, drinking at Harvard would remain dangerous. Rivera may well be correct that pregaming would persist in a world with a lower drinking age, but drinking at Harvard would be safer, I argue, because more students would end their nights in bars, not at dorm parties.
Consider the following thought experiment: A group of students are allowed to pregame to their hearts’ content. Following the pregame, one-third of the students are placed in a setting where they must pay $5 for each additional drink; another third may consume additional drinks at no cost; and the final third, for whatever reason, are paid $5 for each additional beverage they drink. Which group, then, following the pregame would be expected to consume the most alcohol?  Of course, the group that is paid for additional drinks would consume the most, the group that may drink at no marginal cost would drink the next most, and the group that must pay a cost for additional drinks would consume the least.  Indeed, it would be a remarkable economic result if that were not so!
It is completely intuitive that students drink less at bars than at parties simply for economic reasons, and Rivera is incorrect to assume that underclassmen would never avail themselves of these establishments.  Indeed, upperclassmen do frequent the Square’s bars, and seniors’ financial situations are not significantly better than underclassmen’s.  Were the drinking age 18, certainly some underclassmen would abandon dorm parties in favor of bars, and—even if they had already pregamed substantially—over-consumption would decrease because more underclassmen would be ending their nights in settings where they were forced to pay a marginal cost for drinks.
That is not to say that there are not legitimate reasons for why society might have a vested interest in keeping the drinking age at 21.  There is some evidence—though by no means conclusive—that the current drinking age decreases drunk driving fatalities.  Even though this argument is entirely irrelevant to the Harvard question, as almost no students drive regularly, it is certainly true that Harvard administrators cannot legally disobey Massachusetts state law.  Still, if Harvard were left to its own devices to solve its drinking problem the solution would be simple: allow 18-year-olds to drink at the Queen’s Head and entice undergraduates to come by offering steeply discounted food after midnight.  It would both regenerate a vibrant social space for the Harvard community and nudge students into a safer drinking environment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past weekend, Occupy Wall Street protests have continued to spread in prominence and geographic diversity. At first confined to New York, protests loosely defined as combating greed, excessive capitalism, and restoring democracy have spread to American cities like Boston and as far as Hong Kong. On October 1, the weekend before last, around 700 protesters were arrested in a march on the Brooklyn Bridge. In the meantime, the continuing escalation of the roughly month-long protests has begun to take a strain on police resources and succeeded to some degree in disrupting daily life in Lower Manhattan. While commentators writing from its origins as an American movement have compared Occupy Wall Street as a left-wing version of the Tea Party, others—including those claiming to speak on behalf of the movement—have portrayed the protests as an American “Arab Spring.”
Occupy Wall Street has risen up at a conspicuous period of high unemployment and the United States’ weak emergence from the global recession. However, during this time of increasing joblessness and penny-pinching, many corporate executives and financial elites have continued to become ever wealthier. While it is understandable why so many people, including many young people, are angry at America’s vast inequality and the disproportionate wealth of one percent of the population, Occupy Wall Street is fundamentally misguided in its approach.
More legitimate, appropriate, and effective means would help activists pursue and achieve their goals. The ballot box stands out as a particularly striking example; in the 2008 presidential elections, only 64 percent of the voting-age electorate turned out to vote, despite the galvanizing effect of the Obama candidacy and deep partisan divisions. Local and regional elections regularly witness turnouts of less than 50 percent. Protesters who are right now waging a continuous opposition on the streets to Wall Street might instead use this groundswell of energy to organize voting drives. Assuming that Occupy Wall Street protesters are already politically and electorally active, they should spend time rallying their friends and neighbors to do the same.
One of the greatest fallacies of the protest movement is the implicit theory behind Occupy Wall Street that American democracy is broken. The perception that marginalized individuals are left with no option but to protest is a misguided one. Members of the public have every opportunity to make their voices heard through contacting their local representatives—or choosing to become involved in local government themselves. The comparison by some of Occupy Wall Street to the movements behind the Arab Spring smacks of an inherent self-absorption and inaccuracy. It should be plain to all that revolution in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other countries emerged out of very different circumstances, both economic and political, than those behind American popular protests. Unlike some Middle Eastern countries with authoritarian and endemically corrupt governments, or for that matter, some European states with leaders who appear to live above the law, the United States does not suffer from a chronic lack of democracy. Despite the partisan fighting in Congress and blocking of legislation, our nation retains one of the best-functioning and, ultimately, most transparent political systems. Protesters should recognize the differences between their grievances and those of others, and express them through more conventional means.
In short, the fact that protests against capitalism and greed have been inspired by movements from abroad does not mean that the latter’s methods should be replicated at home. Political activism originates and becomes successful in many different forms. As citizens endowed with political rights, it is a mistake to presume political powerlessness at the level of an anonymous individual. Inevitable allusions to the Tea Party movement themselves throw up a striking indication of how Occupy Wall Street might evolve toward a more coherent, functioning, and legitimate movement. Despite the radicalism of much of its message, the Tea Party developed successfully into a major political force through means that were legal, civil, and entrenched in the tradition of electoral and political activism. The Tea Party did not have a decisive influence on the Republican Party and elections of 2010 through protests and disruption. By following this organizational model, Occupy Wall Street stands a chance of turning into something that is truly worth everyone’s attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Hundreds of protesters, including a Harvard contingent of more than 80 students and affiliates, gathered on the Boston Common Monday for an “Occupy Boston” rally, passionately chanting “This is what democracy looks like!”
Tuesday morning around 1:30 a.m., tensions rose high in Dewey Square as scores of police officers cautioned protesters, including several Harvard students, to vacate the Square, where the activists have been camped out since Oct. 1. The officers subsequently began arresting activists at one of the camps.
Voicing their discontent with the current state of politics and the economy. the protesters have taken over Dewey Square, located in the heart of Boston’s financial district across the street from South Station.
Monday’s rally brought affiliates of various Boston-area universities together on the Common before they set off to march through the financial district. As protesters proceeded from the Common, the numbers grew into the thousands.
Before joining the rally in Boston Common, Harvard students gathered in front of the John Harvard statue to show solidarity with other sympathetic members of the Harvard community.
Hannah L. Hofheinz, a fifth year doctoral candidate at the Harvard Divinity School, was one of the many organizers of the “Occupy Harvard” event. Hofheinz cited her concern for the future of the United States as her inspiration for standing with the Occupy Boston movement.
“Or country is hurting, and people are hurting,” Hofheinz said. “It’s important that, as students, human beings, people, that we come together and change [these] social systems.”
The Occupy Boston movement drew its inspiration from Occupy Wall Street, a protest movement which began in mid-September in New York.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Marisa M. Egerstrom was previously involved with Occupy Wall Street and is now supporting Occupy Boston.
Speaking to the crowd gathered in front of University Hall, Egerstrom explained what she sees as a unique opportunity for social change.
“What we have is an opportunity in America to organize in ways that I haven’t seen in the history of the last 40 years,” Egerstrom said. “And many of us have been pissed off for a very long time, but what we’re finding is that a new form of hope is coming to life.”
Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Boston have until now been seen as primarily left-leaning student movements with no clear goals, but as the number of supporters grows, the demographics are becoming increasingly diverse.
In addition to members of Harvard’s Student Labor Action Movement, the audience at the Occupy Harvard event included members of several religious groups as well as members of the conservative grassroots Tea Party movement.
“You can’t categorize this as a bunch of disgruntled hippies being against stuff just to be against stuff,” Egerstrom said.
Egerstrom disagreed with the way in which the protests are being portrayed, explaining that the familiar protest narratives of the 1960s and 1970s are different from Occupy Boston.
“The media looks for the narratives they’re used to finding. They’re used to seeing popular unrest ... and they’re really recycling the image,” Egerstrom said. But she acknowledges that other protests in the past decade, particularly against the War on Terror, have often “conformed themselves to that image.”
William L. Polette, a Boston resident who participated in yesterday’s march, described Occupy Boston in a favorable light.
“I’m starting to see a mix [of demographics]. There are definitely more students, but as we speak, it’s getting larger and larger,” Polette said.
Although Occupy Boston has generally remained peaceful and non-disruptive, yesterday’s march led to at least two arrests.
Additionally, many Boston residents voiced frustration with the traffic congestion caused by the march.
On Sunday, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino indicated his own growing frustration with Occupy Boston. He said the city will decide in the coming days whether it will allow the protesters to continue.
That tension mounted Tuesday morning as police confronted activists camped in Dewey Square.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Oct. 11 at 7:20 p.m.
BOSTON—Boston police arrested 129 protesters affiliated with the Occupy Boston movement, including at least five Harvard students and alumni, in a swift raid on Dewey Square in the early-morning hours on Tuesday.
The arrests were the culmination of a standoff between protesters and police after a weeklong protest in downtown Boston expanded into the northern park adjacent to Dewey Square. The protesters have permission to occupy Dewey Square, but when they expanded into the northern section on Monday, Boston police decided to take action.
On Monday, a second tent city emerged in a northern part of Dewey Square, which is adjacent to South Station, and this new camp reportedly drew the attention of city officials for lacking necessary permits.
Statements by Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino on Sunday indicated that the protests would soon be required to disband. On Monday, the Boston Police Department released a statement saying it respects the right to protest peacefully, and insisted that protesters could stay in Dewey Square but could not occupy the adjacent park. Tuesday morning’s arrests occurred in the park.
Anxieties mounted in the camp late Monday night before police officers arrived, as rumors spread across the Dewey Square occupation through word of mouth and social media that officers were on their way to force protesters to leave.
By 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday, only a small group of police officers were stationed at the scene. But by 1:00 a.m., police officers began to collect around the square and position themselves at different corners of the camp.
Despite growing apprehension, some protesters attempted to maintain the good-humored attitude that defined Dewey Square during the day. One group gathered in a circle and sang “Let It Be” by The Beatles.
Before police blocked off the roads, the protesters were occasionally encouraged by passing cars honking in support. On the outskirts of the camp, EMT ambulances arrived as the police presence quietly grew.
Kate R. Fielding, a Boston resident, expressed a desire for the protest to remain peaceful.
“My friend and I started participating last night. When we came today, we heard that police were coming to break things up,” said Fielding. “We don’t want that to happen. We just want a peaceful protest.”
At 1:40 a.m., about 100 police officers dressed in riot gear and carrying billy clubs joined the other 100 officers already on the scene, lining up in two rows at the corner of the new camp.
Boston Police Superintendent William Evans notified demonstrators with a bullhorn that those who refused to leave within two minutes would be arrested. After between five to ten minutes, officers forcibly broke through a line of protesters and began making arrests.
Jackson F. Cashion ’13, in the north park area when the police arrived, described the showdown as incredibly tense. “For a while, it wasn’t clear where the police were going to come from. It seemed like the police were emerging from all sides,” Cashion said. “I was on the edge, and I wanted to avoid getting arrested. I was scared.”
Samuel B. Novey ’11 was in Dewey Square when the police arrived. He described the police action as hostile.
“The police circled the whole [camp], and they pushed right through the line. Instead of peacefully arresting folks, they broke the line with force,” Novey said. “It was very aggressive police action.”
Protesters affiliated with a group known as Veterans for Peace, an anti-war group, linked arms at the forefront of the line of protesters. Videos posted on the internet show Boston police officers pushing members of this group to the ground as they broke through lines of protesters that had linked arms with one another.
“I would say [the police] used excessive force. The veterans by and large were older citizens, and [knocking them down] seemed completely unnecessary to me,” said Tara D. Venkatraman ’11. “One friend I was with was choked by two officers and restrained even though he was just chanting and not resisting.”
At different moments, groups of people could be seen running away from the epicenter of the arrests. One girl was held face-down while she was handcuffed before being dragged away by police officers.
Joshua S. Bryant, a student at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., was in the camp when police members began destroying the tents. “The police were hitting people pretty hard,” Bryant said. “They just came in and started stomping on the tents. It’s disgusting.”
Some officers encouraged protesters to move back to the original Dewey Square camp, indicating that arrests would not be made there.
Cashion, a member of The Crimson’s editorial board, acknowledged that officers gave protesters adequate time to leave the camp before arrests were made. In addition to a 10-minute warning, members of the Boston Police Department distributed flyers earlier in the night informing demonstrators of their right to free speech, but also explaining the penalties for unlawful gathers and trespassing.
Still, many demonstrators felt that their right to assemble was being violated by being asked to leave. Bryant said that while many of the officers remained cordial, many were overly aggressive.
Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12 described the scene as chaotic. “The protesters remained peaceful throughout the entire course of the protest, chanting ‘This is a peaceful protest!’ even as their friends were being overpowered, handcuffed, and forced into police trucks,” Bakkila said.
During the arrests, officers in many cases used force, handcuffing protestors too tightly according to some and shoving protesters to the ground. “A large number of the plastic handcuffs were deployed recklessly, [and were] put on so tight that they severely restricted circulation,” said Bakkila. “I actually watched my hands turn blue while the sympathetic police around me didn’t have the proper tools to cut my handcuffs off.”
Once at the precinct, officers were apparently of two sorts—sympathetic or belligerent—according to Bakkila’s description. Some officers made crude jokes to the arrested protestors, according to Bakkila.
“When one protester in my group was making his bail call, one of the police officers joked that he needed to hurry up because ‘The beatings start at 4:30!’” Bakkila said.
It is currently unclear who posted bail for many of the protesters, but Bakkila stated that “someone representing Occupy Boston” took care of payment before he was released at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning. The case will be heard on Wednesday.
While many argue that officers were far too aggressive, others charge the protesters were provoking officers by shouting at them and refusing to comply with orders. As officers began arresting protesters, those watching began to shout, “Shame! Shame!” and “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” at the police.
In an interview with the Boston Globe, Boston police spokeswoman Elaine Driscoll defended the Boston Police Department, saying that officers reacted appropriately. “We have been very accommodating to everyone’s right to demonstrate peaceably,” she said. “But when unpredictability starts to enter the scenario, we are obligated to maintain public order and protect public safety.”
A post on the Boston Police Department’s Twitter account says that the BPD supports peaceful protests but is obligated to maintain order and ensure a safe environment.
By 2:30 a.m., after the park was completely cleared out, a blockade of 20 police motorcycles gathered in front of Dewey Square in an apparent attempt to pressure protesters still watching from the outskirts of the park.
After clearing the park of protesters, city sanitation workers arrived on the scene with garbage trucks and loaded left-behind equipment, including tents and medical supplies, into their vehicles.
Throughout the night, Twitter was ablaze with messages documenting the protest and subsequent arrests in real-time. While the social networking tool helped protesters communicate with one another, there were also many false rumors circulating on Twitter throughout the night. At one point, there was widespread talk on the site that reporters had been asked to leave the area, which was not the case.

Just a month after the Kong received approval to close at 3 a.m., another Harvard Square restaurant has decided to appeal to the late-night crowd by extending their hours. Clover Food Lab, 7 Holyoke St., will now close at 12 a.m.Clover received the permit from Cambridge License Commission last week and celebrated their first midnight close with whoopie pies last Friday. The decision to extend hours was made in light of popularity, according to a post on the Clover website.
"Some of you were stopping by at 10 p.m. right as we were closing, it wasn't right to turn people away," the Clover team wrote.
Clover, which opened its Harvard Square location last October, offers fast food with a twist by using local products and often organic choices. Popular lunch and dinner options include chickpea fritter, soy BLT, and eggplant. Clover also offers breakfast from 7 to 11 a.m.
Last May, Clover was approved for a liquor license, and now features a local beer on their menu that they change on a monthly basis. Clover will continue to host late-night launch parties with the brewers to educate people on the beer.
"We're not going to be a bar. We want the beer to be a part of the food," said Ayr M. Muir, owner and founder of Clover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was again an up-and-down week for Harvard athletics. And by up-and-down, we mean that the football team was up, and pretty much everyone else was down.
5. Women’s Volleyball (9-6, 2-3 Ivy)
Harvard split its games this week, defeating Brown but losing to Yale in straight sets. The team shouldn’t be too worried—it has more than a month to hone its dog-fighting skills before it faces the Bulldogs again.
Previous Rank: Not Ranked
4. Sailing
The sailing team capsized (not literally) at the Moody Trophy at Rhode Island, placing 19th. Roger Williams—it’s a college, not a person—won the event. The team will compete in the Captain Hurst Bowl, Yale Women’s Intersectional, and Lark Invitational next weekend.
Previous Rank: 2
3. Women’s Tennis
Junior co-captains Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana lost in the round of 16 in the doubles draw at the ITA All-American Championship. In New York for the USTA Billie Jean King Invitational, the rest of the team won eleven of its matches. The squad won’t have to worry about separation anxiety at its next match, competing together in New York in November.
Previous Rank: 3
2. Football (3-1, 2-0 Ivy)
The Crimson beat Cornell 41-31 behind 414 passing yards from junior quarterback Colton Chapple. The win made the return trip from Cornell slightly more bearable. Is he still the backup?
Previous Rank: 5
1. Women’s Golf
The team resumes play next weekend at the Harvard Invitational after a week off. Sinking putts and nailing ... straight drives will definitely be top priorities.
Previous Rank: 1

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people listen to an album’s songs in their original order anymore. The tracks of an album are picked up piecemeal from iTunes, blogs, or other more illicit sources, and are then sorted randomly into playlists and libraries. Most of the time, little is lost in the process, as artists have adapted to the idea that their album will not be played as it was packaged. But in the case of “On the Water,” the newest album by synth-pop trio Future Islands, the sequencing is absolutely essential.
“On the Water” follows a very strong thematic arc over the course of its 42-minute playing time. The album balances delicately between having a clear artistic direction and an engaging emotional accessibility. Vocalist Samuel T. Herring is able to treat the common theme of heartbreak with a rare sincerity and theatrical flair that is equal parts relatable and grand. Keyboardist Gerrit Welmers and bassist William Cashion provide a rich and dreamy soundscape over which Herring’s vocals thrive. The resulting album is pensive yet accessible.
The album is unambiguously about heartbreak and how one deals with the pain that follows. But what separates this album from other collections of feel-bad break-up jams is its sophistication in dealing with its theme. The songs are never self-indulgent pity-fests, and the band avoids this pitfall through their controlled sonic and thematic development over the album. In the wrenching early track “Before the Bridge,” Herring sings of struggling to come to terms with the end of love—“I can’t forget somehow / For to forget a love is to regret.” In the defiant middle track, “Give Us the Wind,” he triumphantly declares, “Give me the pen / Give me the sword / Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall.” The transition between these two lines reveals the welling strength and resolution represented in Herring’s lyrics. The vocals are supplemented with the tactful use of synthesizer and keyboard from Gerrit Welmers and a hauntingly melodic bass from William Cashion. The instrumentation is spare and tasteful—it revels more in the development of ideas than the quantity of hooks.
Herring’s characteristically theatrical vocal style serves him well on tracks like “Balance” and “Great Fire,” but at points it seems a bit over the top. He delivers his lines like a Shakespearean actor cursing fate, and as a result, songs like “Close To None” lose some of their potency. Herring’s strong vocal style occasionally overpowers his simple, sincere lyrics, as his delivery pushes the words from earnest to overblown and overdramatic. Fortunately, this is not a dominant trend, and the understated bass melodies from Cashion often help compensate for the dramatic vocals. In general, the group maintains their tasteful treatment of an often clichéd subject matter.
“On The Water” does not end with the same clarity or strength of resolve that is present in its midsection, but the record’s development is so well-structured that this deflation is clearly a stylistic choice rather than a loss of focus. The last track of the album, “Grease,” features Herring’s rumination, “This song won’t change a thing.” There is no clear resolution at the end of the album, nor any trite aphorism for similarly heartbroken listeners. Future Islands instead opt for a soberly uncertain ending, because as far as they are concerned, that’s how these things really end. Much of the power of this album lies in its willingness to embrace a lack of final clarity. The band could easily have ended the album on a defiant, optimistic note with “Give Us the Wind,” but such a quaint ending would hardly have done the rest of the album’s emotional build justice. Herring does not reward the listener with a denouement, tragic or comic, because despite his vocal theatrics, he has produced a beautiful and realistic take on heartbreak in “On the Water.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems inconceivable that any realm of Björk’s Biophilia project could be seen as lacking in grandeur. The Icelandic electro-pop enchantress’s multimedia goliath encompasses a book, an “album” of iPad apps, a set of special tuning forks, a full-length LP, and apparently more as yet unannounced components. That the album avoids bloated overindulgence is miraculous. Surprisingly, though, its only weak spot is an element of restrictive simplicity. Björk’s lyrics and sonic architecture almost align in a titanic vision for “Biophilia,” but the album’s stylistically constrained instrumental strategy stunts that conceptual richness.
Björk’s commanding lyrical and vocal personality drives the album. On “Biophilia,” her persona is that of a prophetess enthralled by the natural world. She casts beautiful celestial and molecular meditations—including the fascinating creation myth revue “Cosmogony” and the awestruck DNA ode “Hollow”—and constructs surreal conceits to locate herself in the songs, with lines like “no one imagines the light shock I need / and I’ll never know / from whose hands deeply humble / dangerous gifts as such to mine come,” on “Thunderbolt.” She tends toward elliptical wordiness and eyebrow-raising metaphors—for instance, “like a mushroom / on a tree trunk / as the protein transmutates / I knock on your skin,” from “Virus”—which occasionally reach laughable pretension. But by and large, their abrasive unconventionality feeds into the unhinged persona crafted by her lyrics.
She translates her rapturous lyricism into a character that she cultivates across the album. In a dramatic—and typically technically spectacular—vocal performance, she alternately slips into destabilized and confident modes. Her verses throb with uneven timing and violent dynamic fluctuations; her choruses crest in assured lullabies, as on “Cosmogony,” or the bursts of nervy dance-pop featured on standout “Crystalline.” She also layers resonant backup vocals, and in keeping their volume high and using them as prominent countermelodies, she elevates the parts beyond mere background harmonies.
She comes appreciably close to matching her lush and volatile vocal performances with some extent of instrumental variation. She rarely layers each track with more than one or two keenly chosen instruments at a time, with each clearly audible in vibrant but futuristically minimal fusions. Björk rarely uses the same sound twice: the toy-piano twinkles at the heart of “Moon” remain distinct from the gentle drips on “Virus” and the tingling “gameleste” (an instrument commissioned for Biophilia) on “Crystalline.” Her sparse mixing also isolates the fine variations within each melody, and her regular alterations lend the album a mimetic fragility. Björk’s rejection of standard pop structures as well as conventional time signatures—rare time signature 17/8 makes an appearance—add further intrigue to an elegant musical landscape.
But these complexities pale next to the vastness of her lyrical vision. Despite the small-scale shifts, Björk’s instrumental consistency proves limiting. Even though Björk rarely reuses exactly identical instruments, the differences between each amount to small, comparatively unremarkable touches. The melodies on “Moon” and “Virus,” the moodier figure of “Mutual Core,” and the hollow tones of “Sacrifice” all demonstrate a preoccupation with high, tremulous tunes. Her beats all pulse with the industrial adrenaline of dubstep, and she sticks to an electronic feel for her even rarer bass parts. Her unusual song structures, even, seem to deviate from regular formats in recurring ways—the identically structured “Mutual Core” and “Sacrifice” vacillate between long verses and briefer, catchy refrains, and both lack intros and bridges. “Hollow” and “Dark Matter” define another strategy, in which Björk draws a stream of consciousness across an entire track. These moves tease by subverting pop structures, but they fail to captivate like the expansive narratives of her previous works. The artist balances cohesiveness and exploration a little too conservatively, and the sonic world she shapes feels adventurous only within awkwardly narrow boundaries.
That lyrical depth and imagination, accompanied by some instrumental elaboration, still make “Biophilia” an enchanting, self-possessed work. But due to the limited dimensions in which its permutations unravel, the instrumentation falls short: Björk’s cosmic subject matter chafes against its tight frame, and it in turn seems feeble next to her lyrics’ scope.
