After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 15, Jeff Probst declared a winner of “Survivor” for the 41st time, crowning Erika Casupanan the sole Survivor in an epic season stacked with impressive new players.
However, this season also marked another entry in the increasingly long ledger of Harvard alumni who have competed in the iconic reality show — seriously, do they have a group chat?
Evvie Jagoda, a Westchester, N.Y. native and current Arlington, Mass. resident, defended their dissertation in Harvard’s Department of Human Evolutionary Biology in September and now works as a genetic researcher at the Broad Institute in Kendall Square. Prior to the season, Entertainment Weekly writer and preeminent “Survivor” reporter Dalton Ross made his traditional prediction of who would win the game and selected Jagoda.
Ross’ pick did not come to pass. Jagoda’s torch was snuffed on a surprise split-tribe double elimination night in the ninth episode and they became the third member of the jury. In the episode, Deshawn Radden, despite a bond with Jagoda that dated back to Day Five, ultimately sided with his alliance members Danny McCray and Liana Wallace to send Jagoda home.
But for the out-and-proud Jagoda, who identifies as queer and nonbinary and rocked rainbow-print boxers on the show, the “Survivor” adventure was about more than the million.
In their exit interview, Jagoda gave the customary reflection on their “Survivor” experience, then added, “Any queer kids out there: Be yourself. You’re amazing. Love yourself.” Getting those simple, powerful words on air, Jagoda said to the Harvard Crimson — “that’s everything.”
The Crimson caught up with Jagoda last month after their elimination and discussed gameplay, the history of queer representation on the show, going from Harvard to “Survivor,” turtle migrations, and more.
The Harvard Crimson: You've had a few months to process your elimination at tribal. What was it like watching the episode back? Did you have any screaming-at-the-TV moments?
Evvie Jagoda: It's interesting because you think, you know, it happened months ago, so it won't be emotional when you do watch it back. But yeah, definitely, I got a little sad. It just brings up a lot of emotions, obviously. But I was honestly happy because part of me wondered, “was Deshawn ever planning on actually working with me?” And I think it was clear from the episode that he was, so that made me happy to see. I was screaming at the TV a little bit when I saw the conversation between Danny and Xander [Hastings], where Danny just made it very obvious that he was not going to vote with me and Xander against Liana. I didn't know about that conversation at the time. I really wish I did. But there's also not too much I could have done differently. So it is what it is.
THC: What was your relationship like with Danny? I'm not sure we ever saw the two of you talk in that episode.
EJ: I'm so glad you asked that question. Danny's one of those people where our strategies were just so antithetical — like, he is a big, strong physical guy, and he's always going to be wanting to keep those [kinds of] threats in the game as shields for him and get rid of the schemer-y puzzle people like myself, whereas I have the opposite strategy. But even though our games were really opposite to each other, we actually had a really great personal relationship… We had a really funny bit going on where, at the tribal council where I did go home, Jeff asked Danny a question and he answered with an extended sports metaphor. And I know literally nothing about sports. So then Jeff asked me, “Evvie, what do you think about what Danny said?” And I was like, “Oh, I would have said exactly the same thing.” It was kind of a running joke about how I don't know anything about football.
THC: Your last words in the exit interview to queer kids would have meant a lot to me, growing up watching the show with my family, to catch at the end of an episode. Coming into the show, did you commit to being yourself and queerness was part of being yourself? Or was there a moment where you consciously decided to represent?
EJ: Being loud and proud and joyful about my queerness is just 100% integral to who I am. I literally have a tattoo that says “yay” with a rainbow flag on it. Because that is what queerness is to me. Like, it's not just okay, it's not something I tolerate. It's something amazing about me, that I love about myself and that brings me so much joy. Part of the reason I wanted to do the show was to be able to put that message out there and be someone that people do get along with and wanna play “Survivor” with, and be my full queer self, wearing rainbow boxers and a bow tie. So that was never in question about whether I was gonna do that… I think that the only way that you can play “Survivor” is to go in with as authentic of yourself as possible, because that is how you connect with people and build relationships. And I think that's part of why I was able to have such a good social game. And because I am just like, this is me, I want to hear about you. I'm just so happy they aired that final word segment. Because I've heard from a lot of people that it has meant a lot to them. And that's why I wanted to do the show, you know. That's everything.
THC: There's certainly a history of queer representation on Survivor that's had its ups and downs, I'd say. To what extent were you conscious of playing in a sort of queer survivor lineage?
EJ: That's a good question. LGBTQ contestants on Survivor go all the way back to the very first season with Richard Hatch, the first winner, who was a gay man. And I was very conscious of being in that history. Especially, the representation of non-men queer players is just a lot less. I mean, there's not that many queer players in general, and especially non-men. I think about people going back to, like, “Survivor: Vanuatu,” where you have Ami Cusack and Scout [Cloud Lee] and more recently, Elaine Stott and Lyrsa [Torres] on recent seasons, so there's some great queer non-men players that I just really wanted to emulate and hopefully — especially compared to the players who played long ago — be like an updated version to some degree. I feel like a lot of people around my age or younger, like in Gen Z, present closer to how I present, or there's a lot of people that do use the word queer, are a lot more gender-fluid, and things like that. And that's kind of who I am. So it's cool to be able to present that version of a queer player and LGBTQ player on this season, especially with it being the most diverse season of “Survivor” ever. It was really, really special to be a part of that.
THC: You were a PhD student here [at Harvard]. You mentioned your “anthropologist brain” in a brief moment on the show, but I'm curious what parts of your experience in grad school came in handy on the show.
EJ: One of the main things that we talked about in my department is energy conservation and resources and distribution of energy and how that affects evolutionary strategies and things like that. So for example, there was a moment when either we could have fishing gear or we could have a big plate of fruit. And even though it might seem like the fishing gear was the way to go, we had so little energy and it's gonna cost so much energy to get back a small return of fish… that in that moment I was saying, I think we need to get the fruit because we just don't have the energy to spare to gain back what energy we could get from the fishing gear. Also just with the grad school experience in general, you interact with other grad students, with undergrads working in the lab, with professors, journal editors, so that also prepared me for a game where you're going to be interacting with people across the age spectrum, with different perspectives, and have to work together.
THC: Has anything you experienced on “Survivor” entered into your research brain? Has it informed any of your questions at all?
EJ: Not so much, just because I'm focused a little less on evolutionary questions and more doing primary genetics research. But it's just really eye-opening, to see what it is like to kind of survive in that way. And another thing is one of the chairs of the HEB department, Joe Henrich, studies cultural evolution. The idea is that a primary human adaptation is not just our intelligence, it's the fact that we're able to develop cumulative culture. That's the thing that actually allows us to survive and thrive throughout the world. And I think you can kind of see that in my season. Like, yeah, we're a bunch of homo sapiens, we should be able to survive in any environment. But the only person who was actually able to thrive out there was Naseer [Muttalif], one of my castmates who grew up in an island environment much more similar to Fiji than any of us. He had those culturally accumulated skills of how to live out there. So it just really was a perfect illustration of that idea.
THC: Can I ask you quickly about the turtle metaphor? Did that genuinely happen the way we saw on TV, like Tiffany [Seely] spotted the turtles, and then you all went to the beach? Or were the producers sort of pushing you there, saying there's a migration happening?
EJ: That happened exactly as you saw it on TV. I was actually kind of frustrated with [Tiffany] at that moment, because it was like, we're all so tired. And she's running around looking because she thinks she saw a sweet potato plant at one point. We’re like, Tiff, there’s no sweet potato plant. Then she's like, everyone has to come quick, I saw something crazy. And there were hundreds of baby turtles. You couldn't capture the magnitude in the TV shot, because they just had no idea that was coming. It was truly a magical moment, like being in a David Attenborough documentary or something. But it just was so obvious to me that that was the Yase tribe. We were this small group that was doing horribly in the game. And yet, we were starting to persevere. Even though we were a little small, we were able to overcome a lot of challenges. So to me, it just made sense that we were the turtles and they were us. I'm thinking my next tattoo might be a sea turtle, we'll see.
THC: The cinematography was really beautiful in that moment.
EJ: Yeah, the “Survivor” crew is incredible. And that's a moment that they obviously had no idea was coming. They rock.
THC: As a superfan, what was the craziest moment of “Oh, I'm actually here” that you experienced on the show?
EJ: I mean, like literally all of it. It's just crazy. You're in “Survivor,” you know. Probably the very first moment getting on the marooning and seeing Jeff Probst talking to you. You can see when you watch the show back that every time we come in, I'm always like, “Hi Jeff!” It's so cool. Like, he's just right there. You just get to talk to him. And probably the first tribal council, when you walk out there and you're like, I am in my TV right now. This is tribal council on “Survivor,” and I'm part of it. It's really really cool.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Toronto pop rock band Babygirl was born out of a lifelong friendship.
Debuting in 2016, the group is made up of Kiki Frances and Cameron Breithaupt, who met while studying music at Humber College in Toronto. The pair bonded in school over their similar music tastes and shared dream of working as a songwriter for major pop artists.
“We both took the catalogue of Top 40 hits from the 2000s that we grew up on really seriously, as almost a field of study, so to speak,” Breithaupt said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “So as we bonded over that, we were like, ‘Oh, let's start writing pop songs for other artists,’ sort of like a pitch writing team.”
In the process of composing music for others, the pair discovered a creative chemistry between the two of them that informed the founding of Babygirl, according to Breithaupt.
“Very quickly, we started writing stuff that was not exactly built to that Top 40 format and that's the material that we started Babygirl around,” Breithaupt said. “We had these great songs that didn't really sound like Ariana Grande, but we still wanted the world to hear them one way or another.”
“We made a lot of bad songs, and then when we started making good ones and were like, ‘Let's start a band about it.’” Frances added.
Babygirl released its first single “Overboard” in June 2016, followed by their debut EP “As You Wish” a month later.
Despite gravitating towards a career in songwriting while at Humber, Frances said that she and Breithaupt had always, deep down, wanted to perform their own work.
“When we were kids we didn’t know each other, but we both individually wanted to make our own music and be singers and performers,” Frances said. “So when we started writing together thinking we would be writing songs for other artists, we always both had that internal thing of wanting to be artists ourselves.”
After its release, “Overboard” found its way onto the “Fresh Finds” Spotify playlist, earning the duo almost fifty thousand streams from one day of placement and a reason to keep Babygirl going.
“That was kind of our first little moment of validation where we realized this project has legs outside of just being a hobby, local thing,” Breithaupt said. “I think that really like everything has kind of snowballed from there to an extent.”
Since their 2016 debut, Babygirl has been hard at work, dropping a pair of EPs along with a plethora of singles. According to the duo, a key to the Babygirl release schedule and songwriting process has been quality control.
Breithaupt said that Frances is the perfectionist of the pair, and she always strives for the highest possible quality.
“It's not just sitting there and singing the song,” Frances said. “If you're thinking about it as a recording that is going to last forever, it has to be the best performance I'm capable of giving, which sometimes causes me to want to re record a vocal three times before I am okay with it.”
“There's no amount of labor that we can put into something that we consider to justify it being released,” Breithaupt said. “It's always judged on its merits of what the end product is, not how hard it was to get there.”
Frances and Breithaupt’s dedication and attention to detail has clearly born fruit. The duo’s 2018 EP “Lovers Fevers” drew the attention of Grammy-nominated producer J Kash, who signed the duo to a deal with his label Sandlot Records at the beginning of 2020.
Platinum pop singer Jeremy Zucker is also among the duo’s admirers, and invited Frances and Breithaupt to open for the East Coast leg of his 2021 nationwide tour, giving the pair their first touring experience. Zucker became aware of Babygirl through their mutual acquaintance with pop artist Lauv.
image id=1353589 align=center size=large caption=true
“We were gonna go on tour with Lauv at the beginning of 2020 and then it got canceled, obviously,” Frances said.
“But luckily that relationship led to Jeremy hearing about our music,” Breithaupt added. “And then, Jeremy just kind of slid in the DMs and was like, ‘Hey, big fan of your stuff,’ which was very nice and that’s how it happened.”
Last month, the band finished the tour with Zucker after playing eight cities, including their biggest hometown show to date at the Danforth Music Hall in Toronto. Yet despite Babygirl’s success in the past year, Frances said that the duo still feels like they are earning their keep in the city of Toronto and the music industry at large.
“I think we're still building momentum [in Toronto],” Frances said. “But that show was really fun to play a full room and get to show a bunch of people our music and have people come up to us after.” Despite the challenges of the past few years, she added, those were the moments that kept the group going.

Detroit MC Fat Ray always knew he would become a rapper.
“I remember writing a rap in second grade for a talent show,” Fat Ray said in a call with The Harvard Crimson. “Back then, at 9 and 10-years-old, I was writing raps about wanting to be a superhero.”
The son of an audio engineer, Fat Ray grew up surrounded by music. He penned his first professionally-recorded song at the age of 13.
The teenager’s natural ability to rap earned him the name “Ray da Lyrical.” In 2004, he was signed as “Fat Ray” to the now-defunct Capitol Barak Records, which was then home to the late Detroit producer J Dilla.
“I was one of the last artists that signed to the label,” Fat Ray said. “I came right in under the tutelage of J Dilla. He was a big bro and a mentor.”
At 19-years-old, Fat Ray was working studio sessions with J Dilla, one of the rapper’s personal heroes and a bona fide Detroit Hip-hop legend.
“For me, working with Dilla was like working with Jay Z or working with Dr. Dre,” Fat Ray said. “I felt like I had accomplished something big.”
The pair produced one official release together: “Stupid” off of the 2004 B.R. Gunna compilation album “Dirty District Vol. 2.” However, Fat Ray said that the duo had plans for more collaborations before J Dilla’s passing in 2006.
The rapper’s exposure from his work at Barak Records put him in proximity to fellow Detroit rapper Danny Brown and Brown’s rap crew, the Bruiser Brigade.
First appearing as a song title on Brown’s 2011 album “XXX,” the Bruiser Brigade namesake has since evolved into a full-fledged label, Bruiser Brigade Records, launched at the start of 2021.
Fat Ray joined the Bruiser Brigade in 2013.
“The Bruiser Brigade is a collective of my brothers,” Fat Ray said. “We came together on common ground. We all love music, and we all love each other. We’ve just been trying to push the envelope as far as what we have to offer the music world.”
According to the rapper, Bruiser Brigade takes its name from the 1997 Capcom video game “Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter.” During gameplay, a specific combination of characters is referred to as the “Bruiser Brigade,” a team of superheroes and super fighters.
“When Danny was putting his team together, he had the [videogame] in mind of putting together The Avengers, or a group of superheroes, but for rap,” Fat Ray said.
Bruiser Brigade Records signees include Fat Ray, the producer Raphy, as well as other Detroit rappers like ZelooperZ and J.U.S., who got his start as Danny Brown’s engineer.
Since its founding in January 2021, six projects have been released under the label including Fat Ray’s album “Santa Barbara” and the Bruiser Brigade group album TV62.
On “Santa Barbara,” Fat Ray pays homage to the sample-based sound pioneered by the late J-Dilla, name dropping the producer on two tracks.
As a collective of solo rap artists, the Bruiser Brigade crew acknowledges its lineage to ’90s Staten Island Hip-hop group the Wu-Tang Clan with a nickname coined by Fat Ray: the “Bru-Tang Clan.”
The similarities to Wu-Tang are apparent. Like the New York collective, the Bruiser Brigade is a multi-tool crew composed of rappers, engineers, and producers. In addition to producing group projects, both groups have a hefty catalogue of solo projects by crew members.
The range of skill sets present within the Bruiser Brigade allows the Detroit group to keep the production of solo projects in-house, much like the solo Wu-Tang projects helmed by RZA.
“I was looking at Raphy in the studio one day and it just dawned on me like, man, you’re the baby RZA,” Fat Ray said. “I gotta probably be Method Man or Inspectah Deck, but Raphy has been on a real baby RZA tear.”
According to the rapper, the collaborative atmosphere at Bruiser Brigade Records also fosters friendly competition, which pushes him to be a better musician.
“Hip-hop is a sport, rap is a sport,” Fat Ray said. “We all are just trying to perform at our highest level and for me I always strive for that high-quality, standard Fat Ray performance.”
From J Dilla to Raphy, Fat Ray has been at the forefront of the Detroit rap scene for nearly 20 years. The inception of Bruiser Brigade Records has jump-started a new phase of the rapper’s career, for which Fat Ray said he is incredibly grateful.
“I ain't gonna lie, [my career] has been a frustrating process for me because I believe in Hip-hop,” he said. “I've been doing it my whole life, but I've never lost my love for music even through my financial struggles trying to be an independent artist.”
“So, yeah, it's been a long time coming, but the roses mean everything,” the rapper added.
Alongside the Bruiser Brigade, Fat Ray was featured on the latest tape by Grammy-nominated Hip-hop producer The Alchemist.
On Nov. 24, he performed at Danny Brown’s eighth annual “Bruiser Thanksgiving” to a warehouse full of fans at the Russell Industrial Complex in Detroit.
“It means everything when the fans tell me the music is touching them,” the rapper said.
Fat Ray shared that he is currently working on a new album.

Luke Markinson is a life-long musician, but has only just begun his career as a pop singer.
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Markinson said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson that he first became serious about music while in middle school.
“I've always loved writing songs and making music,” he said. “I started posting covers and songs in eighth grade on Vine.”
Despite garnering a small following on Vine, Markinson did not decide on a career in music until after leaving high school. It was the onset of the pandemic and the amount of free time that came with it that spurred Markinson to release his first single, “Never Alone,” in 2020.
“I realized I was getting older,” the singer said. “I always knew my passion was making music and it's something that gives me a lot of fulfillment. So I was like, ‘Why not put [“Never Alone”] out into the world and see what happens?’”
Markinson wrote “Never Alone” with the help of Yung Pushpop, a producer from his high school and one-third of the LA rap trio Swilmot. The song takes inspiration from the hyperpop genre, a subgenre of pop that includes the likes of 100 Gecs, Charli XCX, and the late SOPHIE, according to Markinson.
“To me, hyperpop is characterized by really catchy hooks, future-forward production, and effects on vocals,” Markinson said. “I was really inspired by Charlie XCX’s sound and the futuristic production, but still incorporating mainstream elements, songwriting wise.”
Shortly after the release of “Never Alone,” the track was added to Charli XCX’s Apple Music playlist. Markinson said he is unsure of how this placement happened, but is incredibly grateful.
“On Spotify artists can pitch unreleased songs and if the playlist curator likes your song, they'll add it, but there's no sort of pitching tool for Apple Music,” the singer said. “So I guess the playlist guy just discovered my music and added it.”
“I just never thought my first song would ever have a response like that and it felt really good to be validated in that way,” he added.
Since “Never Alone,” Markinson’s music has also been placed on the “Hyperpop” and “Glitch” Spotify playlists. The singer said that he has been embraced by the hyperpop genre, which has become a space for LGBTQ+ artists and listeners.
“From a production standpoint, I know that a lot of trans artists have loved hyperpop, because it's all about shifting your vocals and stuff like that,” Markinson said. “So you can literally change your gender expression and stuff through music, which is amazing.”
The singer credited LGBTQ+ artists such as Kim Petras and SOPHIE as well as allies like Charli XCX with pioneering the sound that has become hyperpop.
Despite feeling a kinship to the genre, the singer said that he is cautious about defining his music solely as hyperpop, for the sake of maintaining his creative authenticity.
“I feel like there's almost a stigma around hyperpop now,” Markinson said. “I'm a little wary of just saying, ‘I make hyperpop,’ because my music really could sound so many different ways.”
According to Markinson, there is a close link between hyperpop and the TikTok music scene, which can prioritize commerciality over creativity when it comes to songwriting. However, the singer said that he still feels an obligation to participate on TikTok.
“It's such a double edged sword,” Markinson said. “Because it's like you have to do it to reach new people and it's great because you can reach new audiences, but also, in a way, I feel like it's watered down the process of making music. Something that's supposed to be very intimate and personal has now been commercialized by TikTok.”
The singer has released ten singles since “Never Alone,” and recently announced a new track, “Tie Me Down,” which dropped Dec. 4. As his career progresses, Markinson said that he hopes his self-expression will attract fans of all ages from all walks of life.
“Identity is a big part of my writing,” Markinson said. “Some of my music is super personal, where I'm talking about dealing with internalized homophobia and my sexuality, but also some of it is just for fun. There’s nothing wrong with writing a pop song that bangs.”

Chicago rapper Donnie Dee Money is hard at work.
After taking a year off from music following the death of his younger brother, the rapper said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson that he is focused on the goal of upping his streams and strengthening his brand.
Donnie Dee Money made his return with the single “Your Blessing,” which was released on Nov. 1.
The rapper shared that he decided to come back to music once he had rediscovered his self-confidence in his pen. Grief over the passing of his younger brother contributed to anxiety about performing and writing lyrics, according to Dee Money.
“I lost my little brother and life in general just stopped,” the rapper said. “I stopped recording. I would book a five to six hour studio session and stay for 30 minutes, but now I just go. I don’t leave and I fight through it.”
A self-imposed exile earlier this year gave Dee Money the time to recuperate and plan his return to music.
“During September and October of this year I separated myself from other people to get my focus back,” he said. “I had to get myself mentally together. So I distanced myself from a lot of things and a lot of people and got back in grind mode.”
Since his return, Dee Money has instituted a daily studio schedule and begun working with a Chicago PR firm to promote his music.
“I'm in the studio if not every day, every other day for sure,” he said. “It’s been getting better and better with anxiety. At this point I'm just going with it. I'm not running away from it, I'm running towards it.”
The rapper first started making music in 2012 while studying at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Following a positive response to his first song around campus and from his Westside Chicago neighborhood, Dee Money knew that he wanted to be a rapper.
“Because of the response from the first song I was thinking, ‘Let me try it again just to see if I was just lucky or not,’” he said. “When I tried it again, it wasn't just a luck thing, it was a skill thing and I just kept going forward since.”
After committing himself to a career in music, Dee Money began to settle into his distinct musical style that blends hard-hitting lyricism with melodic production.
Other Chicago rappers such as platinum-artist Lil Durk and the late Juice WRLD helped to popularize melodic rap on a global scale. Donnie Dee Money says he gravitated towards melody because it is what comes most naturally to him.
“It's like poetry to me,” the rapper said. “It's like me reading out of my diary. I'm letting the world in and I'm giving the world my mind. I’m letting y’all inside my world. It's just natural.”
Dee Money’s melodic style is on full display in “Your Blessing,” which the rapper wrote about a bad break-up. The track’s hook and lyrics are a product of his stream-of-consciousness writing style and an acceptance of his emotions, according to the rapper.
“It was all real feelings, real vibes,” he said. “That song is definitely a testimony within itself. I don't have the same dark cloud over me anymore, but I can still write that type of music.”
Through a mutual friend, Dee Money signed on Chicago music video director Free Fam to shoot the “Your Blessing” video, which premiered alongside the song. Free Fam recently directed videos for Chicago artists DCG Shun and DCG Bsavv who blew up last summer and are currently on tour with G Herbo.
Having fully returned to music, Dee Money is also focused on giving back to the Westside of Chicago, where he was born and raised. Last month, the rapper hosted a Thanksgiving charity event for his neighborhood, which included a turkey drive and clothing donations.
“We had tables, music, and a football game setup,” the rapper said. “It was a really friendly environment for everybody to come in as you please and walk out as you please. Eat what you like, grab clothes as you need, it was a real pleasure.”
Dee Money said that he also has plans to host a toy drive during December.
The rapper’s next single “Show Me You Real” was released on Dec. 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Released on Nov. 4, 2021, Charli XCX’s latest single “New Shapes” featuring Christine and The Queens is a bold and empowering exploration of female friendships.
“New Shapes” emulates the emotional support of a group of friendly girls who attempt to cheer you up after catching you crying in the bathroom at a party. “You’re too good for him anyway,” they would say as they wipe away your smudged mascara and help you apply fresh lipstick. The explosive exclamation, “What you want / I ain’t got it” suggests confidence and self-assurance.
However, as the lyrics continue, a more complicated narrative unravels. “New Shapes” tells the story of a stagnant relationship in which both sides are manipulative. The song’s narrator is tired of their relationship and fighting the urge to desert it: “I don't know why I got a tendency to run away.” However, their partner continues this cycle of mistreatment, perhaps emotionally manipulating the narrator to the point that they are a different person: “You call it art, but you pulled on my heart / And you twisted it into a new shape.” Ultimately, these emotional issues in their relationship fade away at night when the pair succumb to their undeniable sexual attraction towards one another. “I surrender to it all night, all day / Then wе fall in love in new shapes.”
Nevertheless, the upbeat and very danceable production makes it easy to overlook the complications in this relationship. Despite being one of the most prominent artists in the emerging hyperpop genre, Charli XCX takes a more traditional path in “New Shapes.” The heavy use of synth and mechanical drums drops “New Shapes” right into the 1980s, creating a glamorous and electrifying experience. Because of its strong and consistent tempo throughout, the track is full of movement. It practically begs the listener to dance along with it. Maybe “New Shapes” is not one of the most experimental pieces in Charli’s discography, and maybe it is not introducing anything new, but it's certainly a fun time. “New Shapes” would have no difficulty fitting right into a John Hughes-style makeover montage.
Human relationships are complicated and messy. More often than not, both sides are to blame for an issue. “New Shapes” tells the listener not to fixate on the problems. Rather, Charli wants the listener to pick themselves up, move on, and find confidence within.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard professor Charles M. Lieber was found guilty in December of lying to federal authorities about his ties to China.
Lieber, a renowned research chemist, was arrested on Harvard’s campus in January 2020 for allegedly lying to federal investigators about his ties to China's Thousand Talents Program — a state-sponsored recruitment initiative aimed at attracting overseas science talent to the country.
A federal jury found Lieber guilty in December of six felony charges, including two counts of making false statements to investigators and four tax offenses. During the week-long trial, prosecutors said Lieber concealed his ties to the TTP in pursuit of money and notoriety.
The Lieber case served as a high-profile test for the Department of Justice’s controversial China Initiative, an anti-espionage crackdown started under the Trump administration that critics have accused of racial bias.
Lieber, who is currently battling incurable lymphoma, will be sentenced at a later hearing. His conviction carries a maximum prison sentence of 26 years and up to $1.2 million in fines.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An external committee examining sexual harassment at Harvard found that a “permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” allowed former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez to continue rising through leadership as he sexually harassed at least 18 women over the course of four decades.
The external committee — commissioned in 2019 to examine the circumstances that enabled decades of harassment by Domínguez — wrote in its final report, released in February, that “pronounced power disparities,” “inadequate reporting mechanisms,” and faculty gender imbalances in the Government Department enabled misconduct.
The review found that Harvard's decentralized structure inhibited knowledge of past misconduct disclosures and reccomended that the University create a “centralized, comprehensive, searchable personnel record." The report also reccomended that Harvard develop a system to monitor individuals accused of misconduct.
In response to the review, four women who were victims to Domínguez's misconduct penned a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling for changes in how the school investigates sexual misconduct. They wrote that they are “unable in good conscience” to encourage women to use Harvard's current Title IX procedures.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decades-long push for an ethnic studies program at Harvard made slow progress in 2021, as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences authorized the appointment of three faculty candidates specializing in the field.
The hiring search for ​​senior faculty to specialize in Latinx, Asian American, and Muslim studies — initially announced by FAS Dean Claudine Gay in June 2019 — was delayed signifigantly by Covid-19.
The authorization of potential senior candidates represents a key step in the FAS’s promise to hire a cluster of scholars in the field. The move comes following years of students and alumni activism for the creation of a formal ethnic studies program. At present, there is no ethnic studies concentration at Harvard.
Additionally, the FAS announced in September that 10 Asian American alumni gifted over $45 million to expand the FAS’s Asian American studies program. Jeannie Park ’83, president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, wrote in September that the group hoped the donation would help "persuade scholars of Harvard’s commitment to building a serious Ethnic Studies program.”
