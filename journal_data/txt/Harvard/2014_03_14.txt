The foundations of modern photography are examined and reconsidered in “Photo Eye: Avant-Garde Photography in Europe,” an exhibition opening March 15 at the Museum of Fine Arts. The exhibition features photographs associated with major artistic movements in the 20th century, such as Cubism, Constructivism, Dadaism, and Surrealism, and includes works by Constantin Brancusi, Ilse Bing, André Kertész, Man Ray, László Moholy-Nagy, and Josef Sudek.
“[The exhibition] shows an incredible time in the history of photography, as artists [were] using innovative and unconventional points of view,” Yousuf and Estrellita Karsh Assistant Curator of Photographs Kristen Gresh says.“There was an important shift in photography after World War I. It’s a moment that contributed to transforming photographic expression for the entire 20th century. People had hand-held cameras for the first time and [were] experimenting.”
 
Although several artistic movements are featured in “Photo Eye,” the exhibition is united by the theme of groundbreaking photographic styles. “We have urban scenes, innovative still lifes, portraits, and such,” Gresh says. “There is a variety of types, but the underlying theme is new ways of photographing. Throughout those themes, we can see that photographers are seeking to capture modern life through different techniques, different points of views, and surprising aspects with light.”
 
According to Gresh, “Photo Eye” is an excellent introduction to the lasting legacy of photography in the early 20th century. “I hope that the public will really see the visual innovation and realize the great amount of things that were being produced. This was a hugely influential time that laid the foundation for photography for the whole century. I hope people will see that and enjoy the wonderful images that were very new for the time, and still feel new now.”

Jackie’s life as he knows it is falling apart after his release from prison in upstate New York in Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Motherf**ker with the Hat” by Stephen A. Guirgis, running from March 7 to 14 in the Loeb Ex. Hoping to start afresh with his lover, Veronica (Ema H. Horvath ’16), Jackie discovers a mysterious man’s hat in his cocaine-addicted girlfriend’s apartment, which leads him to conclude that Veronica has cheated on him. The relational dynamics between the characters are forever shifted when Jackie (Tim C. Moan ’14) learns that the owner of the problematic hat is his own A.A. advisor, Ralph (Dylan J. Peterson ’17)—just one of several betrayals revealed during the play. While the emotional and moral content of the show might have been melodramatic and downright depressing, the skillful acting of the cast rounds out characters beyond mere sketches of people from the wrong side of the tracks.
 
The cast is able to successfully embody the flawed individuals that populate the production. Horvath displays both great acting chops and great chemistry with Moan, bringing to the forefront her character’s inherent self-destructiveness. While Veronica counsels her mother about having self-worth while snorting cocaine, Horvath vacillates deftly between her character’s inherent self-destructiveness and her hope to be something better such as when Veronica counsels her mother about having self-worth while snorting cocaine. Jackie’s cousin, Julio (Dan S. Milaschewski ’17), brings the most levity of any character in the show, alternately advising Jackie and longing to be his older cousin’s friend. In his cautious eagerness, Milaschewski brings not just laughs but some tenderness to a show otherwise devoid of it; his acting is nuanced and well executed. In a similar fashion, the acerbic loneliness and desperation of Ralph’s wife, Victoria (Kathleen S. O’Beirne ’15), might have alienated the audience’s sympathy, but O’Beirne’s refined, natural performance instead underlines how monstrous Ralph really is. 
 
The tight sequencing of fast-paced scenes that gave the production punch is possible due to the excellent set and lighting in the Loeb Ex’s black box. Scenes take place in three locations, which are all present the duration of the show in the black box. Credit is due to set designer Renee E. Zhan ’16, who colorful partitions the Loeb Ex into three different settings: Ralph and Victoria’s home, Veronica’s small apartment, and Julio’s place. The arrangement of set pieces with bright wall colors prevented the black box space from engulfing the actors, instead allowing action to flow from one room to another depending on which was lit. As the various spaces didn’t require time between scenes for the shifting of set pieces, lighting by light designer Adam O. Brodheim ’16 set the pace at an appropriately rapid clip, particularly during Jackie’s rage as he goes between Ralph’s and Veronica’s houses. Rounding out the technical achievements of this production is the sound, from the incidental music chosen to the Commodores played by Jackie: it set the mood without overpowering or satirizing the Puerto Rican elements of the play.
 
The one confusing detail of the play was the aforementioned Puerto Rican component. While the accompanying music and some intermittent Spanish usage between Jackie and Veronica initially indicated that both is Hispanic, Horvath carries on her stylized performance throughout the play, while Jackie seems to undergo a transformation and drop his Latino persona after the first scene. However, the impact of the play is not much changed by Jackie’s discontinuity of character from that initial scene, as more important traits—his staunch desire to do the right thing despite his lifelong tendency to do otherwise and his broken-heartedness over Veronica—remains throughout the show. With a great cast and excellent technical elements, “Motherf**ker with the Hat” is a heartfelt, enjoyable experience.

Dwayne Carter Jr., better known as Lil Wayne, has always been a bit of a nihilist. Even in the heady days of “Tha Carter III,” he was prone to moments of monotonality and verses about nothing. But ever since Young Money began its rapid personnel expansion in 2009, Carter has chosen to rap about women, drugs, and how great Young Money is. In features like Drake’s “HYFR” and Mystikal’s “Original,” Carter showed that he can still paint colorful and provocative lyrical statements, and many of his signees, Drake paramount among them, work with broad thematic palettes. That being said, Carter and Young Money’s general aesthetic, which continues in full force on the new label compilation “Young Money: Rise of an Empire,” values familiar punnery and swag more than depth. The only change from last year’s “Rich Gang” is the increased nastiness and antagonism with which the label expresses its sexual and financial dominance. While the lyrical meanness of “Rise of an Empire” adds a layer of novelty to Young Money’s repetitiveness, it only makes their incessant and uncreative braggadocio harder to swallow and succeeds—however improbably—in fostering nostalgia for the ebullience of their “BedRock” days of 2009.
 
Unlike Young Money’s prior compilations, Carter lets his artists do most of the work on “Rise of an Empire.” His absence opens the door for both the label’s heavyweights and several new voices. Disappointingly, however, established stars Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Tyga only occasionally manage to craft interesting contributions. Minaj and Tyga’s track “Senile” comes closest to what Carter likely envisioned for the mood and effect of the album. The duo imbues the diss track with a lyrical terseness and efficiency that complements the venom of their verses, amplifying Tyga’s fiery query to other rappers of “Can you see now? / Are you senile?” Tyga especially embraces the staccato standoffishness of the track, dramatically lowering the pitch of his voice to heighten his intimidation factor. If all the tracks on the album managed to capture the raw energy of Tyga and Minaj’s anger, the album would be a far more cohesive unit.
 
Unfortunately, however, Minaj’s other track illustrates the inconsistency of the spiteful vibe that reemerges many times over the course of the album. In “Lookin Ass Nigga,” Minaj drops the line “I’m rapin’ you niggas / Look at this pic, look what the fuck I gave to you niggas.” While shock rap and general belligerence can be riveting, the lack of creativity in Minaj’s presentation and the straightforward and overly calm beat make the sentiment repellent. Even though Minaj falters in her unnecessary injection of sexually violent lyrics, she still does a better job than most of Carter’s new talent. Gudda Gudda, a longtime Lil Wayne collaborator and former member of Squad Up, is similarly egregious in the lack of thematic backing or consistency behind his violent and sexist wordplay—he doesn’t seem to be providing commentary or subverting any pre-existing artistic or social stereotypes. The content is not explicit by Young Money’s relatively high established threshold, but on “Rise of an Empire” it seems at its most pointless. While Carter has had some success (though little here) in making asinine images entertaining and funny, his protégés don’t have the control of dynamics or lyrics to make their offensiveness at all thought-provoking.
 
The only one of Young Money’s new voices who is exciting is the baby-voiced Providence, RI rapper Euro, who is also the hitherto-unknown star of the album and a sudden prospect in the rap game. A brand-new signee who came out of nowhere, the 23-year-old raps throughout most of the opening track, “We Alright,” and the entirety of “Induction Speech,” an honest examination of Euro’s emotions as he gains recognition. While “I think I’m getting wasted tonight / I’ve realized that I’ve made it tonight,” should come off as a trite rehash of every rapper’s “arrival moment,” Euro brings so much feeling into the words that they feel new.
 
One can only hear so many 808s without forgetting how diverse real drums—and even a wider spectrum of drum machines—can be. The booming trap bass that intertwines with the ethereal female vocals on “Induction Speech” is an incredibly necessary relief from the monotony of the rest of the production. The only other consistently engaging track besides “Senile” and “Induction Speech,” Drake’s triumphant horn-infused anthem “Trophies,” also has softer and more varied backing. For the most part, however, the flamboyant beats are generic and obnoxiously layered.
 
While Euro and Carter’s other established stars provide some hope for Young Money, the dearth of playfulness and overwrought anger of the project doesn’t lead to any sort of effective alteration to their stale sound. When, midway through his only prolonged verse on the album, Carter brags, “I can’t remember my last drought,” it couldn’t be further from the truth.

First, it must be said: Wes Anderson will never, ever make a movie that will be considered anything less than an unequivocal success. Anderson can do whatever he wants, and a large gaggle of coonskin-capped, khaki-shorts-attired hipsters will ensure that he turns a profit and acquires some amount of critical praise. However, popularity is not the standard of art, unless we are willing to elevate “NCIS” to the head of the modern aesthetic pantheon; and while “The Grand Budapest Hotel” shows Anderson at his technical peak and will be wildly popular in what has become his niche audience, its content falters in comparison with his earlier work. Though “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is perhaps the director’s most visually striking piece to date, it fails to engage the viewer emotionally, and as a result it never transcends its status as a technical exercise—a very beautiful trifle to be sure, but a trifle nonetheless.
 The film’s frame story is that of an author, played by Jude Law and Tom Wilkinson, giving the account of his meeting with Zero Moustafa (Tony Revolori and F. Murray Abraham), the richest man in the former Republic of Zubrowka. While staying at a decaying resort, the eponymous Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero tells his life’s story, beginning with his apprenticeship as a lobby boy to Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), the Grand Budapest’s celebrated concierge and gigolo. After M. Gustave is accused of the murder of Madame D. (Tilda Swinton), one of the hotel’s patrons and the concierge’s lover, he is imprisoned, and it is up to Zero to free him and help exonerate him. As is the case in Anderson’s prior films, the ensemble cast performs brilliantly.
 Visually, this movie is perhaps the pinnacle of Anderson’s technical career—the careful integration of exquisite stop-motion animation sequences works seamlessly with the bright, gingerbread-house-like sets for the live action. The film’s aesthetic is a brilliant, nostalgic but mildly ironic evocation of pre-war Central Europe that gives it a distinctive flavor, while at the same time being a quintessential Anderson film with the quintessential Anderson shots: the bunk bed, the room service trolley (down to the single pink rose), the city roofs.
 The disappointment arises from the film’s lack of engaging emotional content. Anderson’s strongest work, although always whimsical, is founded on a profound wistfulness or melancholy. “The Royal Tenenbaums,” for example, is a very funny movie, but beneath its surface it is a very sad movie.  What stays with the viewers is not so much the montage of Margot’s romantic adventures but the look in Richie’s eyes as he opens his veins. The agonizing neuroses of the brothers in “The Darjeeling Limited” cuts much deeper than Francis’s hilariously bandaged face. Even at the center of “Moonrise Kingdom” there is a certain heartbreak that keeps it relatable to the viewer. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” has no emotional content that can rival these works. The father-son relationship between M. Gustave and Zero never transcends artifice; Zero’s romance with the pastry-maker Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) has the feeling of an afterthought. The problem is not in a lack of subtlety. Peter in “The Darjeeling Limited” is not a subtle character; however, he is also the finest one that Anderson has ever written. The problem is the fact that the characters of the newest movie are not just unsubtle—they are at a certain level unsympathetic. At the end of “The Royal Tenenbaums,” the viewer undergoes deep catharsis from the rehabilitation of Royal; at the end of “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” the viewer does not really care about the conclusion of Zero’s romance with Agatha. Perhaps realizing this flatness, Anderson attempts to introduce a theme of decay by showing the hotel’s sadly reduced state at the time of the frame story; ultimately, however, this effort fails to ground the film on more serious footing.
 Wes Anderson has shown himself to be a masterful artist time and time again, and so one must hope that “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is merely a brief misstep—and, it must be emphasized, a beautifully made misstep—and not the beginning of a general decline. A return to the themes of his earlier career may be in order; otherwise, it is only a few short steps to the creation of mere tableaux vivants: pretty, but far from great cinema.

 It’s nearly impossible for Aaron Paul to outrun his transcendent portrayal of Jesse Pinkman in “Breaking Bad,” even when behind the wheel of the world’s fastest Bugatti. In “Need For Speed,” a more built Paul speaks in a growly and lower register than that of Jesse and does his best to avoid the character’s emotional polarity—in short, he tries to embrace the trappings of a classic leading man. Even with these alterations, Paul seems a bit too eccentric to exude the confidence of most action movie stars. His relative failure to eschew his previous vulnerability and nervous energy saves his film from drowning in its own flamboyant storyline and cinematography. Bombastic race sequences and the frenetic pace of the plot, while technically impressive and consistently exhilarating, are often too big and familiar. The sweeping and gratuitous tracking shots of helicopters, explosions, and impossibly beautiful race locales are all offset by Paul’s range. Although “Need for Speed” often dips into the trite clichés of bloated car movies, Paul’s taut and varied performance as Tobey Marshall buoys the picture and adds personality to its pulpy fun.
“Need for Speed” could be divided into two movies. The first is a collection of interlaced vignettes that ramp up the initial adrenaline while offering scattershot exposition. Director Scott Waugh, a former stuntman and relative newcomer to big-budget directing, isn’t one for slow burning conversation. He jerks the focus quickly from introductions of Marshall’s amiable entourage of fellow auto mechanics to tense interactions with Paul’s nemesis, the slimy and repellant Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) to a visceral street race through their hometown of Mt. Kisco, New York. The climax of this first portion, an ill-fated highway race between Marshall, Brewster, and Marshall’s younger brother, results in the brother’s fiery death at the hands of Brewster’s cheap right-bumper knock. The moment, while still powerful because of Paul’s raw reaction to the inferno (and his subsequent framing by Brewster for the crime), would be more devastating had the narrative spent less time in constant flux; the brother, played by baby-faced Australian newcomer Harrison Gilbertson, is sympathetic but not developed enough to beg any legitimate grief.         
  If the first hour of the film has the panache and efficiency of the video game narrative from which the movie gets its name, then the second half is its opposite: an expansive Bonnie and Clyde cross-country odyssey with Paul, who has been recently released from prison after serving time for his brother’s death, and the sexy caretaker of the car he has finagled for competition in a massive Californian street race, “The De Leon.” The chemistry between Paul and the appealing and brave Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots) is initially slow, but quickly gains traction over the course of their journey west. The writers impressively juxtapose increasingly ridiculous situations (They just got towed over the Grand Canyon by a helicopter! They just jumped five lanes of traffic! They just made seven State Troopers crash into each other!) with subtly flirty dialogue and body language. The development of the romance between the two is restrained and sweet enough to provide ample respite from the chases against time and the law on their way to San Francisco.
  The presence, or lack thereof, of the police is one of the film’s most frustrating drawbacks. Occasionally, cop cars will arrive in bulk, offering intense chases and undertones of paranoia. At other moments, however, the concern of being caught fades away entirely; at one point Marshall parks his car, by this point federally-flagged and a subject of national news, in front of the posh and central Mark Hopkins hotel in downtown San Francisco without issue. Waugh and his writers’ choice to use the police as periodic villains is understandable enough, as the film would drag far more if there weren’t moments of fun entirely unconcerned with incarceration. Their lack of presence, however, makes them a far less threatening and thus less striking foe. Additionally, the cops often act as a reminder of how ridiculous and dangerous Marshall and company’s racing is in the first place. After several lethal-looking highway pileups caused by Marshall’s evasions, it can be hard to root for the street racers.
  The rest of the cast can be likened to the racing scenes in the film. They are many in number and mostly entertaining, but also hard to follow and emotionally shallow. Benny (Scott Mencusi, better known as rapper Kid Cudi), jokes extensively about twerking and pilots a seemingly endless arsenal of flying devices that save Marshall and Maddon from police and bounty hunters. All of Marshall’s friends have similar gimmicks and communicate in tired and outmoded bro-machismo putdowns. In spite of the extraneous fluff, the film retains its octane until the end. When Marshall eventually starts to taste revenge, the slightly twisted grin on his face is irresistible.

In his directorial debut “Bad Words,” Jason Bateman stars as the shameless and foul-mouthed man-child Guy Trilby, breaking away from his typecast as the perpetually exasperated middle-aged man with seeming ease. At the age of 40, Guy has decided to enter the National Quill spelling bee, a competition intended for children who have not yet passed the eighth grade, by exploiting a loophole in its rules. At his side (or perhaps his heels) is reporter Jenny Widgeon (Kathryn Hahn) who has agreed to sponsor the withholding Guy in exchange for his story. As Jenny attempts to suss out Guy’s motivations, Guy heedlessly charges through the competition in spite of the outrage of parents and administrators alike. In the process, he finds himself the subject of fellow contestant Chaitainya Chopra’s (Rohan Chand) unwanted attention. Guy’s abrasive quips seem to have no effect on the persistently adorable boy, and thus the pair form an unlikely relationship. Devilishly funny and surprisingly thoughtful, “Bad Words” does not disappoint.
 
Bateman’s Guy is a delight; not once does the character pull punches, eliminating his competition with a hilariously flippant ruthlessness, undoubtedly traumatizing several children in the process. His behavior is deliciously nasty, and his dialogue wrought with a devastatingly witty petulance. However, it is not at all hard to find Guy endearing, as there is the charm of frankness in his unrelenting discourteousness and a depth to his character in his inherent intellect and interesting background. Guy’s motivations are a key mystery in the film, but it is immediately apparent he did not simply enter the bee on a whim. As his deeply personal reasons for entering the bee come to light, they reveal a tale of revenge—however, “Bad Words” does not try to explain away or justify Guy’s nature.
 
Likewise, Jenny Widgeon’s character is handled with a similar disregard for rationalizations. However, this does not always work to her advantage. Ever the nosy reporter, Jenny serves as an effective and efficient mechanism for getting to know our protagonist, Guy, but otherwise proves to be the film’s weakest link. In some of the film’s most dissonant scenes, Jenny and Guy engage in a strange series of flirtations that begin with a callous exchange of insults and end with begrudging and frantic sex. This not-so-romantic side plot has its merits; it certainly delivers some humor, as well as showing a glimmer of unexpected sincerity as Guy and Jenny’s exchanges begin to carry a nuanced affection towards the end of the film. Thankfully, no attempt is made to explore the relationship beyond these little encounters rendering this subplot merely an excuse to add more debauchery to the film. In the end, Guy and Jenny’s relationship fits uncomfortably with the rest of the script. Though Hahn’s performance was astute, her character is easily overshadowed by the duo of Guy and Chaitainya.
 
Undoubtedly the relationship between Guy and Chaitainya was the highlight of the film. There is something inherently funny about matching the innocent and chatty Chaitainya with the morally bankrupt and misanthropic Guy. Their exchanges, which typically consist of Chaitainya’s whimsical musings and Guy’s curt and vulgar responses, are thoroughly enjoyable. In one of the most entertaining scenes in the film, the pair spend a night out at town, resulting in a riotous montage of their misdeeds set to the Beastie Boys. The seasoned troublemaker Guy and the enthralled Chaitainya go about their mischief with unbridled glee, bringing chaos with them wherever they go. At the end of this night, after Chaitainya asks Guy if their time together means that they are now friends, Guy responds with a dry smile and the middle finger, encapsulating the nature of their relationship: bright-eyed enthusiasm met with begrudging affection. Their camaraderie is deceptive, however, as “Bad Words” refuses to grant us the typical story of the gruff old soul being warmed by an innocent young heart without throwing us a few twists.
 
Though the film fails to escape all clichés, it does not so much succumb to them as it brilliantly subverts them with a gleeful abrasiveness, turning what in any other film would be a hammy and touching scene into a hilarious bout of misanthropic shenanigans. Overall, the film’s well-paced script wastes no time on exposition, effectively juggling humor with coherency. Unfortunately the script does have a tendency to wander, lending an organic feel to the plot, but ultimately detracting from the heart of the film. And here in itself lies a pleasant surprise—the film actually has a heart. “Bad Words” does not simply scrounge up a plot for the sake of setting up a string of punch lines, but instead offers a short and bittersweet story about letting go. Suffusing this theme is the film’s own tendency to dismiss itself; a refusal to take anything too seriously or grant us any moral or message to take home. As Guy muses towards the end of the film in his own attempt to sum up his experience, “They’re just words.” “Bad Words” proves exactly that: words are what we make them, and the result can be strangely cathartic. After all, there is something to be said about a film that can turn the middle finger into a gesture of endearment.

If asked to picture what the police do, many of us might turn to “Cops,” the hit reality show in which a camera crew follows officers on the job, providing 30-minute vignettes of law enforcement for its TV audience. And apparently, since 1989, we have enjoyed watching. Most of the time, however, despite what “Cops” might suggest, we do not actually get to see police officers at work.
Sadly, when we do catch a glimpse, videos all too often capture not marketable arrest scenes but rather the dark underbelly of law enforcement. A quick Google search will yield story after story of police officers caught on tape in controversial episodes of violence, from the beating of Rodney King in 1991 to the killing of Luis Rodriguez mere weeks ago. The existence of these videos is, on one hand, deeply unfortunate. But on the other, perhaps we would actually benefit from more of these expositions. To improve accountability and reduce the number of tragedies, it is essential to videotape police actions as often as possible—indeed, one of the great benefits of this modern media is the powerful transparency it can offer the public.
 
In many contentious cases in the past, videos have provided critical evidence that otherwise likely would have been unknown. Only a security camera was able to capture Kelly Thomas’s pleas for mercy and officers’ declarations that they “smashed his face to hell.” In the case of Rodney King, if a bystander had not secretly recorded officers viciously beating King while he lay passively on the ground, the incident may have simply been logged as a case of “resisting arrest” or a similar transgression against law enforcement. This potential for misrepresentation of facts is particularly disturbing. For instance, Bobby Bennett was shot and arrested by police officers in October 2013, supposedly for lunging at them with a knife. But a surveillance video from the home of Bennett’s neighbor plainly showed that the police shot Bennett while he was standing still, with his arms down, about 20 feet away. In Bennett’s case, official police reports directly contradicted the reality caught on camera.
This is not to say that police officers in general are somehow corrupt or abusive by any means. On the contrary, those involved in notorious incidents are the exception, not the rule. Still, the existence of even some of these cases underscores the ever-present need for accountability in the actions of law enforcement. We as a society entrust the police with weapons and a unique license to use them—a “monopoly on legitimate violence,” as sociologist Max Weber called it. Accordingly, the appropriate use of police power is of utmost public concern and essential to a fair and functional justice system. Reliable, publicly accessible recordings would improve trust in law enforcement—trust that many minorities in particular currently do not have—by giving us more confidence that justice is indeed being served.
Video evidence, which can act as an impartial account of events, is not only valuable for defendants as a check against abuses of authority by police, but also for law enforcement agents: After all, video evidence is as powerful in convicting as it is in acquitting. And yet in Thomas, King, and Bennett’s tragic cases, video feeds existed only because an inadvertent third party happened to pick them up. In essence, we are so well-informed of such tragic incidents only by chance. With modern technology at our disposal, we can change that.
Now more than ever, we have the power and responsibility in our hands to contribute to a fairer justice system. The widespread ownership of smartphones allows ordinary bystanders to serve as civic reporters. Groups such as Photography is Not a Crime, founded in 2007 by photojournalist Carlos Miller after he was arrested for taking pictures of police, advocate on our behalf for civilian journalistic freedom. Recently, our legal infrastructure has starting catching up as well. In the 2011 case Glik v. Cunniffe concerning a 2007 arrest in nearby Boston Commons, the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld private citizens’ rights to record audio and video of public officials in public locations. However, videotaping of police is still a contentious issue, and people today are still being arrested for attempting to hold police accountable. This is a dangerous infraction of civil liberties, something that we as a society must not tolerate.
Beyond civilian empowerment, law enforcement agencies must adapt if they want to avoid more Rodney Kings. Police departments, for instance, should deliberately record officers on the job, ensuring a streaming log of video evidence. Indeed, some police departments have actually begun to move in this direction: For instance, the Orlando Police Department is experimenting with body cameras, and the Los Angeles Police Department recently began equipping officers with wearable cameras. This video technology introduces a constant transparency into law enforcement. What’s more, police officers conscious of the fact that their actions are recorded and may be seen by the public will feel encouraged to act honorably.
In the end, though, the value of video depends on the information it provides us and in turn, on whether we make use of it to demand accountability. A wise Roman poet once asked the question, “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”—“Who will watch the watchmen?” In this day and age of media technology, we have a ready answer: all of us.

Well aren’t you lucky. Stuck here on campus the Friday before spring break, with nothing better to do than read The Crimson, weeping softly to yourself about the midterm you just failed and the fact that the grapefruit you ate for breakfast probably hit its peak in December, just like you. Stop crying so hard—you’re soaking the paper, and making a scene.
Before we get too excited about spring break, a big congratulations is in order for the freshmen who were just assigned their houses! I must admit, I had my doubts. Third parties have reported that this year the administration replaced its sorting hat with a sorting “algorithm”, which is, as far as I can tell, an article of clothing worn around the neck, kind of like a necklace or scarf. Nevertheless, the sorting proceeded as planned, and the number of houses remained constant at 12, with three staying in the quad.
I know what many of you freshmen are thinking. “Me? How could it be me? I knew some people would have to end up in Dunster, but I never thought it would happen to me!” Fret not. All houses were created equal, the same way your parents love you and your siblings equally, ignoring the time they gave your brother a new car for Christmas to replace his old one, and they didn’t even bother to give you, the older sibling, a new bicycle. And now you’re just sitting there, cold and hungry, crying over spilled grapefruit juice. I already told you to stop. You’re embarrassing yourself.
And the rest of you freshmen, the ones who seem to be happy with your house placement, remember that however luxurious your new house may be, it will never be as lavish as the Business School. Does your house gym have a gold-plated hot tub filled with holy water from the Vatican? Didn’t think so.
But the time has come to let all your troubles go and call it a semester. Spring break is upon us, and, let’s be honest, there is no way much of anything will get done when we return to campus just in time for summer. For the first time since Jon Snow was sent to the Wall to protect us, the sun will finally shine. Brace yourselves; Yardfest is coming.
First, though, spring break.
Look on with jealousy at all your friends who are headed to Cancun or Punta Cana, even though they assure you they are going strictly to practice their Spanish: “Señor, un plato de nachos y una bomba coche Irish, por favor.” These lucky souls will return to campus glistening with gorgeous tans, or, as my mother terms it, early stage melanoma. They will also show up to lecture next Monday still unbalanced and swaying side to side, getting over their “sea legs” after spending a week “riding the rough waves” of “los nocheclubs” in the Caribbean.
But instead of lying around sloshed by the beach or frolicking in the water, you’ll probably sleep for two days and get right back to homework, conveniently due the day after break. Professors here are the best. “Oh, you have a week off? Great, then why don’t you write a policy memo and work on a group presentation focusing on European banking integration? You heard me correctly, a group presentation, due the Monday you get back.” I’m looking at you, Ec1400.
Once the memo is finished, you may or may not need to fill out a dozen or two summer applications for unpaid internships in which you might or might not wind up doing more than using the stapler and coffee machine. Those skills, your employers will tell you, are probably more applicable to “real life” than the class you’re taking on the history of Dadaist influence on the application of Cubist structural architecture in downtown Johannesburg. They might be right.
So no “bombas coche Irish” for you.
As for me, I’ll be on the beach in Miami, practicing my Spanish. If you’ll be in town, stop by and say hello.
But I’ll probably be too wobbly to say hola back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Twitter swiftly approaches its eighth birthday (the underwhelming first tweet was posted on March 21, 2006), it’s important to look back to how we got here. During its first years of operation, the site has stockpiled accomplishments, blowing past 500 million users, launching an IPO, and most monumentally of all, returning twelve search results in the Harvard Course Catalog. When I was eight, my biggest accomplishments to date were cutting duct tape out of my hair and stealing the girls’ kickball at recess.
Twitter issued a less start-uppy mission statement when the newly-public company officially filed for the aforementioned IPO, but the original objective simply read, “[Twitter’s goal is] to instantly connect people everywhere to what’s most important to them.” On all accounts, the site has remained true to its word, providing tweeps the virtual domain necessary for engaging in the dialogue that “is important to us.” But by deeming particular topics more “important” than others, Twitter users are inadvertently squandering a previously unimaginable opportunity to better public discourse.
Over the past few weeks, international crises have flared up in several locations. What began as a peaceful demonstration in Ukraine has rapidly erupted into violence and the Russian occupation of Crimea. Student protests in Venezuela over the astoundingly high murder and inflation rates have been raging since early February. Last Saturday, Malaysia Airlines lost contact with a passenger plane carrying 239 people, and all efforts to locate the aircraft have proven futile up to this point.
These three stories alone have the capacity not only to dramatically alter millions of lives, but reshape the international landscape in its entirety. Some scholars believe that the emergency in Ukraine holds the capacity to vault humanity into a second cold war or third world war. That merits some discussion. But according to Trendsmap, a site that aggregates the most popular topics online, the Twittersphere has been fixated on relatively inconsequential themes.
On the same day that Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Kiev, and the same day that Egypt banned Hamas operations within the country I was able to discern two ‘Ukraines’ and a ‘Putin’ on the trending topics list. Otherwise, the map is dominated by the likes of Ellen Degeneres, LeBron James, pancakes (no clue), and a playfully awkward exchange between scandalous child stars.
Unfortunately, I am not writing this piece from an intellectual high ground. My Twitter handle is as guilty of this misprioritization as even the most heinous of offenders. A Tuesday night post revolved solely around my late-night purchase of Fruit Gushers, and last week I provided my few followers with a “live tweet” of Kanye West’s interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers. Contrary to what Kanye himself might think, those two tweets are nothing more than mere obstacles my followers must circumvent in their quest for meaning and substance.
That being said, purposeful information is certainly available on the site provided one is willing to commit some time compiling a respectable timeline. Accounts like @CNNbrk and @NYTimes provide followers with up to the minute news alerts, and searching specific keywords allows for connections to be fostered between users sharing the same interests. In terms of real world application, Twitter aided in the coverage of the search for the Tsarnaev brothers, as well as showered Texas State Senator Wendy Davis with support in her pro-choice filibuster.
But the same site also allowed fangirls to spread their infatuation with the terrorist’s appearance and Tea Party member Todd Kincannon to fire off a slew of sexist tweets directed at Davis. Regrettably, this is the Twitter most of us have come to know and love. The most followed account on the site is pop singer @katyperry, trailed closely by pop singer-turned-potential-felon @justinbieber (probably due to his #maturity). Glad I could get two digs in there. CNN is the highest news outlet on the list, coming in at number 33 behind genuine visionaries like @Real_Liam_Payne and @Pitbull. I can’t say with confidence what Twitter founder Jack Dorsey actually had in mind when he created the site (I should have asked him on Wednesday), but I doubt he invested all those hours so Kim Kardashian could accidentally reveal the identity of the air marshal sitting next to her.
Perhaps I’m being naive. After all, Twitter’s goal was merely to connect people to whatever was important to them. If people would rather overanalyze a kiss between Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus than a potential shift in the global power structure, kudos to Twitter for providing them that opportunity. Maybe what constitutes as important has shifted, and I’m just late to the party.
But I don’t think so. What I do think, is that it’s much easier to tweet the quirky thought that pops into your head or fall into line with a mob mentality than it is to research a complex issue and formulate an opinion on it. Whether that’s right or wrong is not for me to decide. And I don’t think it even has to be decided at all. Through its very nature, Twitter will continue to adapt and change in a way that best reflects what society would like to gain from the service.
Just please, no more Justin Bieber. He is literally the worst.

Despite the proverbial security of the “Harvard bubble,” homelessness is one social problems that Harvard students encounter every single day. A stroll down Massachusetts Ave. or a trip to the CVS brings you face to face with the pervasive homelessness that exists right outside the gates of the richest higher education institution in the world.
Bread and Jam, a daytime, drop-in shelter here in Cambridge, works to improve the situation by providing food and shelter to those who need it.  After decades in operation, that shelter will close its doors on March 25, 2014. Changes in federal funding—which will now prioritize permanent housing solutions over street outreach—meanthat many programs helping the homeless right outside our door are being shut down. While we admire the federal government’s efforts to fund permanent housing for the homeless, the corresponding shift of funding away from daytime shelters like Bread and Jam will literally leave people out in the cold. Now, more than ever, it’s important that both students and governments to make eradicating homelessness a priority.
According to the City of Boston Homeless Census, 85 percent of both temporarily and chronically homeless people in Boston suffer from a mental illness, a disabling condition, substance abuse, or a physical disability, all of which require support and attention from society. Daytime shelters like Bread and Jam provide much of that support, and they are already strained and overflowing, unable to provide services to all those who need them. The closing of Bread and Jam will therefore be keenly felt among Cambridge’s homeless population. The only other such program in the Square is Youth on Fire, a drop-in center for homeless individuals under 24 years of age that is located near the law school. Yet that shelter too will soon leave the Square: It plans torelocate to Central, also citing cuts in federal funding.
The closing of Bread and Jam will exacerbate the already pervasive problem of homelessness, and both students and the government should prioritize ensuring that all people have access to safe shelter. For the government, this can mean re-examining policies that shift funding from street shelters without guaranteeing a replacement to fill the void. For students, making a difference can mean volunteering at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which is run and staffed primarily by College students through Phillips Brooks House. We should all try to be more cognizant of the issue and redouble our efforts to make homelessness a thing of the past.

Harvard has appointed Alicia Oeser, the current interim director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, to serve as the same office’s next permanent director after a national search lasted over a semester, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde announced in an email to undergraduates Thursday.
Oeser succeeds Sarah A. Rankin, who departed Harvard at the end of September to take on the then-recently created position of Title IX Investigator for MIT after seven years as OSAPR director. Oeser has served as the office’s interim director since Rankin’s departure in the fall.
As OSAPR director, Oeser’s responsibilities include supervising Response Peer Counselors and Sexual Assault/Sexual Harassment advisers, according to Oeser’s staff page on the OSAPR website.
“While at Harvard, it is Alicia’s desire to increase accessibility of OSAPR to individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexualities and to continue improving provision of culturally competent, non-directive service,” the description reads.
Prior to joining OSAPR, Oeser worked in the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office in Illinois as an LGBTQ/hate crimes specialist and at DePaul University as coordinator of sexual violence support services.  Oeser declined to comment Thursday afternoon without clearance from public affairs officials.
Matt G. Wardrop ’15, a member of Consent, Assault Awareness, and Relationship Educators, praised Oeser’s appointment Thursday, calling her “relatable” and saying that it is important that OSAPR has a permanent director again.
“Alicia has shown herself to be passionate about the work [in OSAPR] and passionate about Harvard” in her time so far at the University, Wardrop said. “I think she’s going to usher in a really exciting new era for OSAPR.”
Wardrop added that Oeser will continue Rankin’s “legacy of inspiring student leaders” in the office.
With Rankin’s departure in the fall, administrators convened a committee of faculty, staff, and students to search for a replacement, and the search was national in scope, Lassonde wrote in the announcement email.
Harvard University Health Services spokesperson Lindsey Baker said in December that the committee had by then finished its initial review of applications for the position. Director of the Department of Health Promotion and Education and Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services Ryan M. Travia oversaw the search.
Much of Rankin’s tenure as OSAPR director overlapped with a time of heated debate surrounding issues of sexual assault and Harvard’s sexual assault policy. In fall 2012, a referendum on the Undergraduate Council presidential election ballot calling for the reconsideration of the College’s sexual assault policies passed with 85 percent of the vote.
Harvard also recently created administrative positions in an effort to address Harvard’s sexual assault policies and the University’s compliance with Title IX. The University appointed federal civil rights attorney Mia Karvonides to serve as its first Title IX officer in spring 2013, and she later convened a working group to consider Harvard’s sexual assault policies.
Last November, Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94 and Administrative Board case manager Emily J. Miller were named the College’s first-ever Title IX coordinators.

A ten-year Harvard Medical School initiative aimed at researching the health problems associated with playing football will be funded solely by the National Football League Players Association, not the National Football League, a spokesperson for the NFLPA confirmed Thursday.
A collective bargaining agreement signed in 2011 by the NFL and the NFLPA outlined goals to collectively fund a medical research initiative and earmarked a “joint contribution amount” of $11 million annually from both organizations. According to the Boston Globe, after a competitive application process, the NFLPA selected the Medical School as the base of the jointly funded research initiative.
In January 2013, the Medical School announced that the NFLPA had issued a $100 million grant for the unprecedented research endeavor, which would involve several research facilities affiliated with the Medical School and a study of more than 1,000 retired football players regarding concussions, musculoskeletal trauma, and high-impact activity on player health.
However, though the collective bargaining agreement indicated that both the NFL and the NFLPA would contribute to the research initiative, George Atallah, a spokesperson from the NFLPA, told sports news outlet ESPN that “the landscape [of the initiative] has changed slightly.”
According to the ESPN article, Atallah said that the NFL will not be providing funds for the Medical School study. When contacted by The Crimson, another NFLPA spokesperson confirmed Atallah’s statement, adding that “at this moment, [the NFL has] not contributed to the program.” Furthermore, the link to the website of the initiative, coined “Harvard Integrated Program to Protect and Improve the Health of NFLPA Members,” which appeared in the original 2013 press release, is now broken.
When asked for a comment on the situation, an NFL spokesperson did not directly address the NFLPA’s claims, writing in an email that “the NFL’s grants to a variety of initiatives will help accelerate the medical community’s pursuit of pioneering research to enhance the health of athletes past, present, and future.”
Researchers involved with the initiative referred The Crimson to Medical School communications director David Cameron, who did not comment directly on the situation but pointed toward a recent program overview issued in Feb. 2014 regarding the initiative.
The overview did not mention a specific dollar amount of the grant or the NFL’s involvement in the grant. However, the overview did offer a timeline and state that “the first statements of work have been launched,” with the condition that the researchers would have to “achieve clear benchmarks” to secure continued funding. It is unclear whether or not researchers knew about the stipulations attached to the funding when the grant was first announced.
Currently, the NFL is in the process of channeling more than $30 million to the National Institutes of Health, as well as financing a separate initiative through General Electric. Commentators cited in the ESPN article are now characterizing the NFLPA’s 2013 announcement of the $100 million grant to the Medical School as a public relations stunt, designed to publicly pressure the NFL into funding the initiative.
Academics acknowledge that the NFL is likely to choose the studies they fund with care. Professor Stephen A. Greyser, a senior marketing professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in sports management said, “I can only speculate as to their thinking, but if I were in an analogous situation, what I would probably say to myself is if I participate in a particular study, to what degree am I bound to accept the results?”
Amid changing circumstances, the NFLPA spokesperson said that the union is “happy that the research is moving forward.”

Columbia University announced Thursday that it has joined edX, the online education platform co-founded by Harvard and MIT, becoming the organization’s 33rd “charter member.”
Columbia is the third Ivy League institution to join the platform, in addition to Harvard. The university will operate as ColumbiaX and plans to launch its first three courses later this year.
ColumbiaX’s first courses will center around American Civil War history and be taught by Columbia history professor Eric Foner. Foner is the author of “The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery,” which won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for History, and a professor at the university.
The Columbia Center for New Media Teaching and Learning, an initiative founded in 1999 to encourage the use of technology and other media to enhance the teaching environment at Columbia, will help develop the new courses in conjunction with edX.
“Columbia schools and faculty have been engaged with online learning for many years," said Columbia Provost John H. Coatsworth in a press release. "Joining edX will help us to provide the richest educational environment possible for Columbia’s students, as well as learners outside the University.”

Jack Belliveau, associate professor in radiology at Harvard Medical School, died at the age of 55 on Feb. 14.
Belliveau provided a major breakthrough in his field and went on to mentor many of today’s researchers.
Most recognized for his discovery of the functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, technique in 1991, Belliveau was a leader of his field. He served as a research fellow at the Massachusetts General Hospital in the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Center, using dynamic susceptibility MRI with a contrast agent to measure the changes in blood volume in various regions of the brain.
Unlike the EEG, which measures electric signals, this novel method allowed scientists to practice advanced techniques.
“[These were] exquisite things we didn’t even think of 20 years ago,” said colleague Tom Brady, director of the Center at the time.
With the new technique, neurobiologists could get clear images of the brain and observe which sections of it reacted to different activities.
“It was a very hard problem and people weren’t at all convinced it can be done,” said Bruce Rosen, former advisor and professor of radiology at the Medical School. “So, when Jack stood up as a graduate student and presented these findings…a lot of people took notice that otherwise had been somewhat dismissive of this possibility.”
Following the discovery, Belliveau presented the study to the Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine in San Francisco, where he won the Young Investigator Award.
The discovery provided clearer images of the brain that would later enable postdoctoral fellow Kenneth Kwong to use endogenous contrasts and to create a safer human fMRI. His discovery changed the field of neurobiology.
“Jack was a lightning rod that inspired a generation of neuroscientists,” Brady said.
The Boston Globe reported that Belliveau died of complications with a gastrointestinal disorder, according to his wife, Brigitte Poncelet-Belliveau.
However, Belliveau’s passion extended beyond these technological advances and lead him to further research.
“His dream was to record the human consciousness,” said Jyrki Ahveninen, who met Belliveau as a postdoctoral student, and is now an assistant radiology professor at the Medical School.
Until his death, Belliveau led a group of investigators at MGH studying the visual and auditory systems using multi-modal imaging tools. He also attempted to increase the temporal resolution of fMRI so that it could capture images at a much faster rate.
“Though many labs use fMRI, Jack came to realize—even having invented the tool—that it had certain limitations,” Rosen said. “So he had set out to bring other technologies to bear to study the brain.”
Belliveau would go on to become the first president of the Organization of Human Brain Mapping.
“He would always push me towards making large advancements rather than working on small increments of contribution,” said Giorgio Bonmassar, a former postdoctoral fellow of Belliveau’s and a current assistant radiology professor at the Medical School.
While his enthusiasm and passion for science was evident through his work, friends and colleagues remember Belliveau as a social man who was an avid golfer, skier, and drummer.
“I was really impressed with his creativity…. Jack always had this great sense of wonder and also a great sense of humor,” Brady said.
Belliveau also served as a mentor for numerous neurobiologists, for whom he was an inspiration.
“Perhaps what I see as the most important pieces of advice that Jack gave me relates to crystallization of what is the very essence of science,” wrote Iiro Jääskeläinen, a former mentee, in an email. “One of the things Jack often said was that the tasks of  a scientist should be simply ‘elucidation of the truth and dissemination of knowledge’.”
Belliveau is survived by his wife and his daughter, Amélie.
His contribution to the field of neurobiology did more than just modernize the methods biologists used to observe the brain, colleagues say.
“The way physicians evaluate the blood flow to the brain is by using the tools that Jack created, and many lives have been saved around the world, so it’s not just his impact on basic science and the engineering of brain imaging,” Rosen said. “It’s literally saved lives.”

As Harvard begins construction in Allston after a four-year pause, Allston residents have begun to question the role and make-up of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, an advisory board the Boston Redevelopment Authority charged with acting as a liaison between the neighborhood, the city, and the University.
Residents say that while they commend the efforts of the task force, which was originally convened in 2006, going forward into the next phases of Harvard’s development they would prefer to see the task force better reflect the diversity of ethnicities and ages that make up the Allston neighborhood.
“The Task Force is doing good in the community, but we have to be careful to make sure that those who do not live [in Allston] are really representing us,” Allston resident Renny McKinney said.
McKinney stressed that he believes all the task force members have the best interests of Allston in mind, but Allstonians must remain active in task force discussions to keep the discussion rooted in the community.
Many residents said that meeting that goal will require greater efforts by the BRA to increase the diversity of the task force to better reflect the racial and ethnic groups as well as age ranges that make up the Allston community.
“The demographics of the Task Force make Allston seem older and whiter, but when I look at my neighbors and my community, that’s not the case,” resident Galen Mook said.
Long-term resident Joyce Radnor also called for a greater mix of people on the task force, which meets with varying frequency throughout the year as BRA prepares to review new Harvard development.
“Our neighborhood has been ethnically diverse for over 100 years,” Radnor said. She called the task force “heavily white and heavily male.”
The issue of representation does not stop with the age, gender, or skin color of residents who sit on the task force. Some members of the community have said that where members of the task force reside could influence their ability to represent the neighborhood.
“The Allston Task Force should be made up of Allston residents or people that have an interest in this neighborhood,” Radnor said.
She added, however, that current members of the task force, including Newton resident Bruce Houghton, have shown a dedication to the concerns of the community.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force was created in 2006 as Harvard’s development was heating up in Allston to create a channel for community feedback to the city. After receiving nominations from the elected officials in Allston, including city councilors and state legislators, the final makeup of the task force is determined by the Office of the Mayor of Boston, as well as the directors and staff of the BRA.
As task force members leave the committee, the BRA appoints replacements. Five new members were added to the task force through this process last summer. Nine of the original 17 task force members remain.
Resident John Eskew called that process “absolutely non-transparent,” and many Allston residents described the selection of new task force members as occurring behind closed doors at the discretion of the mayor.
Other complaints have arisen regarding what community members call a lack of opportunity to participate in the operations of the task force. Many residents said they wish for better publicizing of task force meetings and more time allotted for community comments.
Task force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 attributed the lack of time allotted to community input during task force meetings to the priority given by the BRA to presentations from Harvard and its developers.
According to Houghton, imposed time constraints imposed prevent everyone from having the opportunity to voice their personal opinions. For instance, the task force was offered just a couple of months to produce a request for community benefits associated with a master plan Harvard had taken years to assemble.
But Gerald Autler, a representative from the BRA, said “there are plenty of opportunities to participate in the process and attend meetings as a community member.”
Acknowledging this potential for community input, residents said that the task force has room for improvement and evolution.
“The Task Force is committed, and I respect the years of dialogue they have had with Harvard, but the formation, roles, and responsibilities of the Task Force may need to be looked at with fresh eyes,” Mook said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 14, 2014, at 12:50 p.m.
Janelle Monáe will be the headlining act at Yardfest 2014, according to a video posted by the College Events Board on its website late Thursday night.
The Grammy-nominated American R&B and soul musician is known for her critically acclaimed 2010 concept album The ArchAndroid, her hit song “Tightrope,” and her guest vocals on Fun.’s 2012 song “We Are Young.”
The CEB and the Harvard Concert Commission, who planned the event, began their search for a headlining artist last October, according to an email circulated by members over House and freshman dorm lists. The email also included a Qualtrics poll asking for student preferences on the choice of the artist and their thoughts on how Yardfest overall should be presented.
The groups finalized their contract with Monáe over the past week.
“Janelle’s personal brand of funky, psychedelic pop music and her rad backing band are going to make for an awesome show, and we’re expecting the student response to reflect that,” according to a statement by the two organizing groups.
The selection of last year’s act, Californian rapper Tyga, provoked vocal criticism from student groups who spoke out against the artist’s allegedly misogynistic lyrics and called for the cancellation of his performance. In response to the controversy, the CEB decided to push back Tyga’s appearance to later in the evening to allow students unhappy with the choice to eat and leave early.
This year’s artist has generated significantly less controversy so far, according to students interviewed shortly after the announcement.
“Every year I have been at Harvard—and I’m a senior—Yardfest has been headlined by an artist that is both sexist and terrible. Janelle Monáe is neither,” Andrew J. Boyd ’14 said.
Other students agreed, although they said that Monáe was not their first choice.
“She’s cool,” Devi R. Nair ’16 said. “I was all for the Nickelback 2014 campaign or the Raven Symone campaign, but this is good too.”
However, some students voiced concern over the fact that Janelle Monáe is not as widely known as previous acts, with several students saying they had no knowledge of her whatsoever.
“Tyga may have been a more popular name, he was a more recognizable name,” Erin P. McDonnell ’15 said.
Others voiced their confusion over Facebook. “[W]ho is she?” wrote Nick D. Bendell ’17 on the post announcing the choice. The comment had garnered more than 21 likes at press time.
Still, despite Monáe's low profile, students expressed their satisfaction with the selection.
“That’s definitely an improvement from Tyga last year,” Laura W. Ottinger ’16 said. “I’m so excited to see a woman on stage, she’s wonderful and it’ll be wonderful.”

In a hotly contested game last season, the Brown men’s lacrosse team scored four unanswered fourth-quarter goals at home to beat Harvard, 11-9, in the squads’ Ivy League opener.
For both teams, this Saturday’s rematch in Cambridge carries the same weight as that game did a year ago: beat a conference rival, set the tone in the Ivy League, and get in position for a postseason run.
“It’ll be an exciting game,” said Crimson junior goaltender Jake Gambitsky. “Brown always brings out a good crowd, and we’re hoping we get a lot of Harvard fans out there. It’ll be a fast-paced, high-energy game.”
The Bears (3-1) have given their fans plenty of reasons to be excited recently. The team, led by eighth-year coach Lars Tiffany, has won its last two games after finishing last season with its first winning record since 2010.
Much of Brown’s early success has been the result of outstanding defensive play. Sophomore goaltender Jack Kelly has posted the eighth-best save percentage in the country at 60 percent.
The Bears have a potent offense as well, with freshman attackman Dylan Molloy earning his second Ivy League Men’s Lacrosse Rookie of the Week nod four days ago after scoring a combined seven goals in victories over Hartford and Hobart.
Brown attackman Sam Hurster has also had a hot hand. The senior racked up a career-high six goals in the win against Hartford.
“They play a quick, scrappy kind of game,” said Crimson co-captain and defenseman Joe Petrucci. “They like to run in transition and try to score a lot of points in a hurry.”
The Brown offense has a tough challenge to overcome, however, as Gambitsky has been solid in the net for Harvard. The junior won recognition as the Ivy League Player of the Week after helping the Crimson get two wins with a 12-save performance against Quinnipac last Tuesday and a career-high 18 saves against Georgetown on Saturday afternoon.
“Having a guy like that playing goalkeeper is huge for us as defensemen,” Petrucci said. “It allows us to go out there with the confidence that we can leave it all out there when we have him playing behind us.”
The Harvard attack will be bolstered by the return of sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer. After a breakout freshman year in which he put up 43 points in 14 games, Dwyer was forced to sit out the first four games of this season with a hand injury. He came back in last week’s contest against Georgetown and led the team with five assists and five groundballs.
“[Dwyer] is great to have on the team because he makes everyone around him better,” Petrucci said. “He uses his great vision to give other people opportunities to score.”
Peter Schwartz, the Crimson’s co-captain midfielder, has provided another spark to the squad’s offensive attack. In the game against Georgetown, he put up five points and made three of his four shots on goal.
“We just need to go out there and play our game,” Schwartz said. “We’ve put the work in, and we know our strengths. Now we just have to use them.”
The Bears’ lineup has relied on its speed to generate scoring opportunities. Many of its 53 points this season have been the result of an aggressive transition game.
“We’re going to have to play disciplined defensively,” Petrucci said. “Get them away from the goal, keep the ball off our half of the field, and move the ball around well.”
In this matchup, each team hopes to set the tone for its midseason stretch of games that will follow.
Brown’s next matchups include Bucknell University and Providence College, two squads that are coming off of recent losses.
Harvard will face stalwart opposition when it travels to Chapel Hill, N.C., to face the No. 5/4 University of North Carolina. The Tar Heels’ offense, which averages 16.2 goals per game, is second only to No. 13/13 Albany, which beat Harvard, 14-8, at the beginning of the month.
But, for now, the Crimson has to remain focused on Brown, which finished tied with Harvard for fifth in the Ivy League in 2013. In 2014, both teams are a threat to break the top four of the conference and secure an Ivy tournament bid.
For Harvard, last year’s game in Providence mirrored other conference losses to Cornell and Yale in which the Crimson jumped out to an early lead but could not hold on.
Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 and the team enter this year’s league play with a new motto.
“Our team’s motto this year is ‘buckle down,’” Schwartz said. “That means we go out, play hard, and get the job done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While many of their classmates will head home to relax over spring break, the Harvard women’s water polo players will travel across the country to California for 11 games, all of which will be against schools from the Golden State.
Six of the Crimson’s (8-6, 0-1 Ivy) opponents on the road trip are ranked in the top 20 in the nation, giving the squad the opportunity to test itself against some of the strongest teams that collegiate water polo has to offer.
“When I got [to Harvard], my goal was to build this program into a top program,” Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. “And to be a top-20 program…you have to learn how to play at that level consistently, and I think that’s what were doing now with this portion of our schedule.”
The Crimson begins the West Coast swing with four games at the Aztec Invitational on the campus of No. 16 San Diego State. Harvard plays Cal Lutheran and the tournament hosts on March 15, followed by No. 11 UC San Diego and No. 10 San Jose State on March 16.
For many members of the Crimson, the games will have added significance. Minnis is an alumnus of San Jose State, and nine of the team’s 15 players hail from California, the most well-established hotbed for water polo in the country.
“I think everyone likes to go to California to play,” junior co-captain Ariel Dukes said. “There’s a huge difference between indoor and outdoor pools, so I know we’re all excited to play outdoors. Everyone’s families come, so we look forward to this trip all year.”
Minnis hopes that his California charges will enjoy the extra time with family but also expects the squad to maintain concentration on the task at hand.
“We’ll get to play in front of our friends and family from back home, so it is a nice little homecoming,” Minnis said. “But I think there are distractions that come with it.”
It will be up to Harvard’s players to make sure that those distractions don’t affect their focus, as the grueling stretch of games will be taxing not only physically but also mentally.
“We know it’s a marathon—it’s a marathon every year,” Dukes said. “I don’t think any of us think it’s going to be a really easy week.”
After the Aztec Invitational, the Crimson has two days of rest before concluding the trip with six games over four days.
On March 19, Harvard will split up into two squads to play games at Whittier and Pomona. The next day, the Crimson will head to Cal State-Northridge for a rematch against Cal Lutheran and then a game against No. 7 Cal State-Northridge.
The Crimson will close the trip with matchups at No. 2 University of California, Los Angeles and No. 17 UC Santa Barbara. The Bruins, which fell to Stanford in the national semifinals at Blodgett Pool last season, will likely offer the stiffest test of the season for Harvard. Only defending national champion and No. 1 University of Southern California stands between the Bruins and the number one ranking in collegiate water polo.
Free from the pressure of the academic grind, the Crimson will look to refine its game over the break.
“It’s easier to stay mentally prepared now in this stretch than it is when [they] play four games in a weekend, and [they] are studying for midterms and all that stuff that happens when [they] are on campus,” Minnis said.
As the team heads across the country, Harvard will bring a balanced scoring attack that has seen six players record double-digit goals through the season’s first 14 games. Sophomore Yoshi Anderson, a native of Laguna Beach, Calif., leads the team in points with 43, and she also possesses a knack for creating opportunities for the rest of her teammates with 17 assists this year. Senior Shayna Price, who shares the team lead in goals with 26, will also be counted on to lead the way for the Crimson offensively.
On defense, Dukes anchors the Crimson in goal. The junior’s 73 saves thus far this season have been instrumental in helping Harvard pull away in wins and stay competitive in losses.
Of Harvard’s six losses this season, half have been by two goals or fewer. When the Crimson takes an early lead, on the other hand, the team has tended to run away with games. Five of its eight wins this season have come by six goals or more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a fast start, Harvard softball coach Jenny Allard’s squad will look to continue to breakthrough during spring break in the final leg of its opening nonconference stretch.
The Crimson (6-4) will compete in two tournaments and 12 games in California, starting with the San Diego Classic II on March 15-17.
Harvard, which has yet to play at home, will look to build upon its success from two weeks ago when it won the Purple and Gold Challenge at Louisiana State. The Crimson took four of five in the Bayou, including an upset victory over No. 23 LSU to capture the title.
The tough competition continues this weekend, as Harvard faces the Texas-Arlington Blaze (13-11), the Long Beach State 49ers (16-7), the Texas Tech Red Raiders (18-6), and the San Diego State Aztecs (16-7).
The tournament promises to be one that will test the Crimson, particularly with familiar opponents such as the Aztecs and the Red Raiders. The host Aztecs received votes in the latest top 25 USA Softball poll.
“I’m excited about San Diego State and Texas Tech,” Harvard captain Shelbi Olson said. “We’ve seen both of those teams multiple times in my career here, and they’re always good competition.”
Harvard has seen strong pitching from its starting rotation, led by junior and two-time Ivy League Pitcher of the Week Laura Ricciardone. The team has held opponents to 29 runs through its first 10 games while posting a 1.77 ERA.
Offensively, the Crimson has had its share of standouts in the batting rotation. Junior shortstop Emily Gusse leads the team with a .407 batting average and has yet to strike out this year.
Senior third baseman Kasey Lange has also helped carry the load for the team at the plate, leading Harvard with five RBIs to go along with a home run and two doubles.
Despite Gusse and Lange’s performances, Allard believes the Crimson’s offense could improve and achieve more balance.
“In the lineup, we’re looking for other players to step up and be more consistent,” Allard said. “We’re looking for our seniors in the lineup to step up a little bit more…. We want to have consistent offensive production, one-through-nine in the lineup.”
Doing so will be a tall task for Harvard, which will have to deal with full bullpens of quality pitchers.
San Diego State’s sophomore ace Danielle O’Toole has posted 11 wins on the season, tied for eighth in the nation. In addition, Long Beach State senior Erin Jones-Wesley has nine wins in 14 appearances, and Texas Tech sophomore Gretchen Aucoin has posted a 1.03 ERA, among the top 35 in the country thus far this year.
With such potent arms on the mound against an offense that has been inconsistent, sustaining its pitching advantage will be key for the Crimson.
Ricciardone has shared the mound this season with sophomore Morgan Groom, junior Gabrielle Ruiz and reigning Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week Taylor Cabe. Groom is close behind Ricciardione in earned runs average with a 1.21 ERA through 17.1 innings pitched this year.
“We’re obviously going to need a lot of production all the way through the lineup,” Ricciardone said. “We have a lot of games, so our entire pitching staff, all four of us, need to be ready to go and throw a lot of innings.”
Despite the intensity of the competition, Harvard is hoping to use this tournament as a metric for improvement and to gain experience against high quality teams.
The squad views the weekend as another chance to develop its game to meet one of its biggest goals for the season: to recapture the Ancient Eight crown after failing to reach the championship series last year for the first time since 2009.
“We’re planning to take [this tournament] game by game,” Olson said. “Overall, we’re hoping to leave with a pretty good win percentage.”
“Our main goal at the end of the day is to just play as well as we can play.... As long as we play our best we’ll be happy. We’re not really going in with any expectations [but rather we would like to] play ourselves into a better spot,” she added.
Overall, the Crimson is looking forward to playing in front of some familiar faces while soaking in a few rays during spring break.
Seven Harvard players hail from the Golden State.
“We’re excited to get back on the road,” Allard said. “California is a great trip for us and we’re looking forward to having a lot of families and fans out there, and [the chance] to play in nice weather.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s basketball team (26-4,13-1) heads into post-season play for the third straight season, individual honors continue to pour in for the Crimson. Junior guards Wesley Saunders and Siyani Chambers, who helped Harvard capture its fourth straight Ivy League Title, were tabbed to the National Association of Basketball Coaches All-District Teams in District 13.
Saunders, who has led Harvard in scoring, was named to the first-team for the second year in a row. Saunders was also named to United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) All-District I Team, association officials announced Tuesday.
Chambers, last season’s unanimous choice for Ivy League rookie of the Year, was named to the second team, after garnering first team recognition as a freshman.
The duo has led a dynamic offense this season and shown the capability to score in bunches. Nonetheless, it has been the often-underrated defense of the two that has led to the team’s success, as each draws the toughest defensive assignments on a nightly basis.
Saunders, who burst onto the scene his sophomore year, has continued his productive play, averaging 14 points per game while shooting 47% from the field
Meanwhile, Chambers has been the floor general since his freshman campaign and has averaged nearly 5 assists per a game and 1.3 steals per game this year.
Friday night, the Crimson punched its ticket to the NCAA tournament, with a 70-58 victory over Yale. Chambers showed why he has been arguably the most dominant point guard in the Ivy League against the Bulldogs, as he poured in 17 points and 7 assists.
The following night, Saunders reminded the Ivy League why he has been its most feared scorer the past two years, as dropped 19 points in the Crimson’s overtime victory at Brown.
Chambers and Saunders won’t take the floor again until the NCAA tournament, as Harvard eagerly awaits the announcement of its place in the tournament bracket.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The culmination of the regular season has inundated the Harvard men’s basketball team (26-4,13-1) with awards, as six members of the Crimson were announced to the All-Ivy League team on Wednesday.
Junior guard Wesley Saunders led the pack, as he was unanimously voted to the first team for the second straight year. Saunders was also named the Ivy League Player of the Year, becoming only the third player in Harvard’s history to garner the award. Saunders averaged 14 points per game and dropped 20 points five times this year.
Sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers, the reigning Ivy League Freshman of the Year, was named to the list for the second straight year, as he once again showed why he is the teams floor general with his passing and high-intensity play. Joining Chambers on the second team All-Ivy were captain Laurent Rivard and junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi.
Senior point guard Brandyn Curry and senior forward Kyle Casey were both named The co-captain Curry, who missed almost half the season due to injury, still managed to win all conference awards for the third straight season. In his final campaign, Casey was named All-Ivy for a fourth time, as he anchored Harvard’s defense and joined the exclusive list of 1,000 career points.
Co-captain Rivard improved from his spot as an honorable mention last season, as he became the programs all-time three-point scorer and joined Casey with over 1,000 career points this season.
Moundou-Missi was named to the list for the first time in his career, after a dominating performance in the Ancient Eight. The junior poured in a double-double to help the Crimson beat Princeton at Jadwin Gym for the first time since 1989 earlier this year, and then helped the team cap of the season with a dominant 21 point 11 rebound outing at Brown on Saturday night.
The six All-Ivy selections helped Harvard in winning its fourth straight Ivy League, after clinching the title at Yale on Friday. The Crimson is currently awaiting its seed in the NCAA tournament before it step back onto the hardwood.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While sophomore wrestler Todd Preston’s double sudden death overtime victory at the EIWA Championships all but guaranteed him Athlete of the Week honors, here were some other baller performances (read: they all played really good basketball) by Crimson athletes this past weekend.
Steve Moundou-Missi, Men’s Basketball
Moundou-Missi scored the first two points of the game for Harvard in its NCAA tournament berth-clinching win over Yale, 70-58. The junior forward added 14 more along the way to finish with 16 points and six boards. Moundou-Missi put up even better numbers in Saturday’s overtime win over Brown, finishing with 21 points and 11 rebounds to earn his second double-double on the season.
Laurent Rivard, Men’s Basketball
Rivard, as team captains are wont to do, played like a confident upperclassman and hit clutch buckets in key moments for Harvard in its two victories this weekend. Rivard was only one of five from three on the night as he rose up from beyond the arc with less than three minutes to go in Friday’s game against the Bulldogs. Yale had slowly clawed its way back to cut the margin to single digits on its previous possession, but Rivard drilled the three to effectively end any chance of a Bulldog comeback.
By Saturday night’s game, the sharpshooting senior had found his touch, going 4-8 from three on the game. Rivard’s last three was once again his biggest as the co-captain gave the Crimson a five-point edge with under a minute to go in overtime. After the game, Rivard credited teammate and fellow AOTW runner-up Moundou-Missi for freeing him up with a great screen on the play.  The three, Rivard’s last of his regular season collegiate career, moved him into second-place in the Ivy League for all-time made three pointers.
Temi Fagbenle, Women’s Basketball
In an interview after Friday’s win over Yale, Fagbenle said multiple times what an honor it was to play for her coach, Kathy Delaney-Smith, who now sits alone atop the Ivy League Basketball all-time wins list. The biggest reason why Delaney-Smith earned that monumental win? Fagbenle’s play on the court Friday night. The junior forward finished with 23 points and 12 boards to lead the Crimson against the Bulldogs. Fagbenle added to two blocks to go along with her double-double and put in three huge baskets down the stretch to secure the victory.
The British Olympian played only 19 minutes on Saturday with senior Elise Gordon getting big minutes in the final game of her Crimson career. The junior put in eight points on just six shots to go along with four rebounds and three assists for an efficient night.

Here you are, just a day before spring break with no plans. All of your blockmates are going to Florida, but you never bought your ticket because you have a fear of purchasing airline tickets (who knows if the site is going to crash???). You could stay on campus and finally catch up on all that reading you missed, but no. You can’t do that. So here are some cheap, last minute options for spring break!Zip Car Road TripThink of all the places you can get in a one-hour radius of campus. You could drive an hour North, an hour West, or, if you are a big spender, two hours North!Cambridge GalleriaMiss those days back in middle school when the only thing to do was to hang out in the mall and pretend like the guy with the gauges in Hot Topic didn’t intimidate you?

So get your parents to schedule that non-emergency surgery that you have been putting off since freshman year. Hopefully your medical insurance covers morphine.Akron, OhioSpring Break Ohio!
