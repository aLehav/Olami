After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard employee who asked a neighbor with a biracial daughter if she lives in “affordable” housing in a video that went viral and drew widespread criticism has been placed on leave.
The leave will be “effective immediately” for Harvard Humanitarian Initiative Executive Director Theresa A. Lund, the initiative’s director Michael J. VanRooyen wrote in a Facebook post Thursday night. He wrote that the organization “does not condone” Lund’s behavior in the video.
“Each of us is committed to advancing our organization’s values of belonging and inclusion,” VanRooyen wrote. “As such, HHI will implement in the coming weeks additional trainings and programs for our staff to address implicit and explicit bias.”
In a heated exchange—which Cambridge resident Alyson Laliberte filmed before posting it on social media July 14—Lund sat down next to Laliberte and her daughter and told them they were being too loud. Lund then began asking Laliberte where she lives.
“Are you in one of the affordable units? Or are you in one of the Harvard units?” Lund asks in the video.
The video has been watched almost 2 million times since Laliberte posted it. In her original post to Facebook, Laliberte called Lund “another Permit Patty,” pointing to a series of recent incidents nationwide in which white adults have accosted or called the police on black children performing everyday activities. Laliberte wrote that Lund’s actions were “discriminating and racist.”
Shortly after Laliberte posted the video, Lund apologized for her actions on her personal Facebook page, writing she should not have asked Laliberte whether she lives in affordable housing.
“I am terribly sorry about the exchange I had with my neighbor yesterday,” she wrote. “What I said was inappropriate and wrong.”
She also wrote that she apologized to the mother-daughter pair in person. Lund appears to have deleted her social media accounts.
VanRooyen’s post did not specify how long Lund would be on leave. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier, VanRooyen appears to have sought to defend Lund, writing in a now-deleted tweet that
“Theresa Lund is an ethical and principled individual and leader” and that “the recent posts do not represent who she is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Washington Post chief correspondent Dan Balz will return to the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics this fall as the organization’s first-ever “senior fellow.”
Balz previously served as an IOP residential fellow in fall 2017. IOP Director Mark D. Gearan said Balz’s position as senior fellow is “new” to the IOP and will allow Balz to “visit campus frequently during the semester.” In his new role, Balz will not host a study group or live on campus, as is customary for residential fellows.
Gearan said in a press release Friday that Balz’s popularity as a resident fellow and his experience with the media and politics prompted the IOP to extend him a second invitation.
“Dan Balz brings a unique perspective to our work at the IOP. As a veteran reporter and astute observer of American civic life, he will bring his vast experience covering political campaigns to our work at an important time in electoral politics,” Gearan said in the release. “We are fortunate to have his many talents and his deep understanding of the IOP, as a very popular fellow, and engaged member of the Harvard community.”
Balz, a longtime political reporter for the Washington Post, has covered 10 presidential campaigns since he joined the newspaper in 1978.
In a press release, Balz said “he couldn’t be happier about being welcomed back to the Institute of Politics.”
“My experience last year as a Residential Fellow and my involvement in other programs over many years before that have given me a deep appreciation for the IOP’s mission and its faith in public service as a way to foster a strong democracy,” Balz said. “I’m also grateful for its commitment to the students, who are the lifeblood of the institute, and I especially look forward to working with them in the months ahead.”
Balz's appointment comes as the IOP is restructuring its fellow system in the wake of intense criticism of the IOP’s decision to revoke the fellowship of Chelsea Manning and grant fellowships to former Trump staffers Corey Lewandowski and Sean Spicer. At the time, Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an email that the School was “working to better understand our current practices for applying the term 'Fellow', and to establish consistent standards across the School.”
In an interview with The Crimson in Feb. 2018, Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said this new set of standards would take effect in fall 2018.
