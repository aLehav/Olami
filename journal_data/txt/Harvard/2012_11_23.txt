After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the hundreds of undergraduates who stayed on campus this Thanksgiving, the break offered an opportunity to gorge on four different flavors of pie, catch up on school work, and reflect on what matters most.
Harvard community members who made their way to the dining hall in Dunster House between 11:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. on Thursday were greeted by a classic New England feast of roast turkey, cider-glazed ham, and sweet potato casserole. Nearly 700 students and faculty came out for the dinner, according to Dunster House Master Roger B. Porter.
One such patron, Clara Q. Chen ’16, admitted after dinner that she may have had too much to eat. "The sweet potato soufflé is really, really good,” she said.
Another attendee, Curtis L. Lahaie ’15, said that the “homey” cloths lining the dining hall tables made the dinner feel more intimate.
Other diners praised Harvard University Dining Services workers for facilitating the feast.
“Thanksgiving dinner at Dunster House was a warm and wonderful event in large part because of our outstanding dining hall managers and staff,” Porter wrote in an email to The Crimson. “We are grateful for their excellent service and cheerful smiles that brighten our day.”
David T. Zhang ’15 echoed Porter’s sentiment, saying, “The meal is good itself, but besides that I’m thankful that there are staff here that cook for all of us.”
Other undergraduates, facing looming deadlines for end-of-semester projects, papers, and finals, said that they were taking full advantage of the quiet study environment on Harvard’s temporarily tranquil campus.
Peter A. Boyce II ’13 said that he was using the “really quiet and peaceful” break to focus on his academic work.
And while some students on campus expressed regret that they were unable to spend the holiday with their families, many said that they were able to give thanks in other ways.
Min Jin Lee ’15, an international student who said that distance precluded her from going home to South Korea, said on Thursday that she planned to spend Thanksgiving dinner with her host family near campus.
Likewise, Natalie Maria ’16, who said she did not return home to Florida because plane tickets were too expensive, used the break to send appreciative emails to her high school teachers.
Maria, who said she was looking forward to seeing her family in several weeks over winter break, said that spending Thanksgiving away from home was far from dreary.
“Maybe if this was a movie and someone was walking around with a camera constantly reminding me that I’m not with a family, [I would] be sad,” Maria said. “But real life is not that dramatic.”
And with Dunster being the only campus dining hall to stay open for all meals during the break, Maria joked she had another thing to be thankful for–her laptop. 
“I am currently sitting outside Dunster for whole stretches of the day just waiting for meals so I don’t have to walk [back to my dorm],” Maria said. “I’m thankful for my laptop which allows me to do this.”
For his part, Boyce said that while he wished he could have spent the break with his family, he found solace in self-reflection.
“Spending time apart really makes us appreciate the time we can come together for the holidays,” Boyce said. “You need a reminder of how valuable time with family is and how special that is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s basketball team will look to extend its winning streak to four games this Friday in Ann Arbor, Mich., where the Crimson (3-1) will face the University of Michigan (3-1) for the first time in program history.
The matchup against the Wolverines comes as part of a two-game Michigan road trip that will end the following day when Harvard plays Eastern Michigan (1-2) at the EMU Convocation Center in Ypsilanti, Mich.
“We’re facing two opponents we’ve never faced before which is good for us in the sense that they don’t know much about us either,” co-captain Emma Golen said. “We definitely have a lot of momentum going in to play two big schools in bigger arenas in front of a lot of people. We’re pretty confident right now and excited to go on the road.”
The Crimson has built that momentum with three straight victories against North Dakota, BYU, and Holy Cross, the last of which came on Tuesday when Harvard topped the Crusaders, 80-62.
Michigan comes into the battle just as hot after a resounding 72-29 win over Seton Hall on Monday. The game set a new NCAA-era program record for fewest points allowed. The Wolverines have held opponents to an average of 50.8 points per game while averaging 61.
The starting squad that helped rout Seton Hall was made up of five players who have started every game for Michigan: guards Brenae Harris, Jenny Ryan, Nicole Elmblad, and Kate Thompson, and forward Rachel Sheffer.
Sheffer has led the team in scoring this season with an average of 16.3 points per game and double-digit performances in all four contests thus far. The senior has made 59 percent of her field goal attempts and 56 percent of her three-pointers. She has also grabbed 24 defensive rebounds and handed out 12 assists.
Second in scoring for the Wolverines is Thompson, who has netted an average of 14 points per game and hit 14 treys this season. The senior drilled five threes against Seton Hall en route to a career-best 19 points.
At 6’4”, the guard also leads the team in blocks, with eight. Her height poses an issue for the Crimson, who only has two players above 6’1”: forward Temi Fagbenle, who matches Thompson at 6’4”, and 6’2” forward Marissa Brock, who has yet to see game action this season.
Harvard arrives at Michigan's Crisler Center looking to earn its best start since the 2004-05 season with a win over the Wolverines.
Against the Crusaders Tuesday, Harvard began slow, trading off leads until a third three by Crimson guard Christine Clark put her team up, 15-12, with 10:38 remaining in the first period. From there, Harvard retained the lead for the rest of the game and defeated Holy Cross, 80-62, helped in large part by a big night from Clark. The junior finished the affair with a season-best 25 points on 9-for-17 shooting from the floor and 3-for-4 behind the arc.
“[Clark] was great [Tuesday],” Golen said. “I think a big thing for her was she played extremely smart, she ran the defense really well, [and] she didn’t try to do too much.”
Clark has led the team in scoring this season with an average of 18.8 points per game. She boasts a perfect foul shot percentage, hitting all 13 this year, and has made 50 percent of her field goals.
“She’s just a better player now,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith of Clark. “She’s older, she’s more experienced, she makes better decisions, and she’s a very talented player.”
Junior Missy Mullins was second for the team in scoring Tuesday with 13 points. She was the only other player to score in double digits. The bench as a whole contributed heavily to the win, adding 32 points as a group.
“This makes me so happy,” said Golen of the bench's play. “They come to practice every day and work just as hard as everyone else.... I think that everyone that played [Tuesday] and got into the game played phenomenally.”
The win was a group effort, with seniors Victoria Lippert and Golen each scoring nine points, and co-captain Miriam Rutzen, sophomore forward Erin McDonnell, and Fagbenle adding six each.
Thus far, all but three players on the Crimson roster have seen game action as the team gains a better sense of how to play together.
“It takes some time to transition and connect with each other,” Delaney-Smith said. “I like where we are right now, but there’s lots of work to be done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself in contention for much of Friday’s game, the Crimson was not able to pull out the victory and lost to Michigan, 72-61, in Ann Arbor.
Harvard (4-2) trailed by seven points at halftime, but the Crimson took advantage of sound defense in the second half to tie the score at 43 with 13 minutes remaining in the contest.
The teams traded baskets for several minutes before the Wolverines (5-1) finally pulled away, going on a 7-0 run to take a 70-57 lead with less than two minutes to play.
“I was pretty disappointed we weren’t able to hold on and win,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We had a pretty good game, but we had to be more disciplined in certain areas, and we weren’t. They’re a very good team, so we had to put it all together to beat a team like that. It’s disappointing that we didn’t win it, but we can learn from it, and we know what we have to work on.”
Junior guard Christine Clark continued to account for much of the Crimson offense, amassing 23 points and eight rebounds both team-highs. Clark shot 50 percent from the field in 39 minutes on the floor.
“[Clark] was again outstanding tonight on both ends of the floor,” Delaney-Smith said. “[She’s playing] very smart. Her experience now is kicking in. She’s making fewer and fewer errors, and she’s making great decisions with the ball. She’s doing a great job.”
Michigan benefited from the production of senior guard Kate Thompson, who led all scorers with 24 points, including 18 from beyond the arc, a number that more than doubled the total of the rest of her team from three-point range.
Senior guard Jenny Ryan also put together a solid performance for the Wolverines, accounting for 17 points and a team-high six assists.
The first major Michigan run came at the end of the first half, when the Wolverines outscored Harvard 9-1 in the final four minutes of the period to take a 36-29 lead at the break.
The Crimson eventually battled back and played with Michigan for the majority of the second half, culminating in a small Harvard lead, 46-43, with 12 minutes remaining in the game.
But a few minutes later, the Wolverines took over and scored nine straight points to seize control of the game with an eight-point lead.
The Crimson struggled offensively in the closing minutes and could not bridge the scoring gap, as missed shots and turnovers resulted in only nine Harvard points in the final nine minutes of play.
“I think they made a run when they needed to,” Clark said. “We weren’t able to pull together to get some defensive stops, and that’s what ultimately won it.”
Senior guard Victoria Lippert and senior forward Miriam Rutzen contributed nine points apiece, while sophomore forward Temi Fagbenle, who averages 9.0 points per game on the year, finished with a single point on 0-of-6 shooting.
Michigan took advantage of Harvard mistakes to pick up key baskets throughout the game, scoring 21 points off turnovers to the Crimson’s 11.
The two squads employed a similar style of play throughout the contest, as the number of field goals, three-pointers, and free throws attempted by each team differed by only one in each category.
“We played Michigan really close the whole time, and we can learn what it takes to win basically in a close game,” Clark said.
Clark has been Harvard’s leading scorer in every contest this season. Through six games the junior is averaging 19.0 points per game, nearly four points higher than her average last year when she was named to the All-Ivy First Team.
Friday marked the first time the Crimson and Wolverine women’s basketball programs had ever faced off.
Although the loss ended Harvard’s three-game winning streak, the game provided the team with a chance to gauge where it stands against a much larger, power-conference school at the onset of a long season.
“[This game] validates that we can achieve the goals we’ve set for ourselves,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everyone’s coming out of this game knowing we could have won it. We have the tools to be able to win it, and I think we have a good sense of what we have to do to make it happen, and that’s a good thing.”

November 19, 1925: Agent and Police Wet-Blanket Football Theatre Party—"Too Drunk to Talk to" Is Charge of Tremont Official
 
The University football squad, for whose entertainment an evening at the Tremont theatre had been planned, yesterday failed to witness "The Cocoanuts" because of the cupidity of an officious police officer and the unreasonable temper of the Tremont theatre's business manager.
 
Six taxis were engaged by the management to convey the players to the theatre. Upon alighting, the members of the party entered the lobby in a manner that was described by Manager S. de J. Osborne '26 as "not noisy, but quietly keyed up."

 
November 19, 1931: New Fire Station Will Be Built In Colonial Style
 
The new Cambridge fire station, to be erected on the plot of land between Memorial Hall and the Yard, will be of Colonial Georgian architecture, to conform with the Harvard buildings, according to information received yesterday. A preliminary appropriation has been made by the city council, and an architect will be appointed shortly, Mayor R. M. Russell '14 also stated. Work on the demolition of the Rogers Building, which now occupies this land, will begin as soon as plans are completed and construction of the station will be started during the present academic year.
 
The plot of land which will be the site of the new station was in the possession of the University until a few years ago when it was exchanged with the city of Cambridge for other land that was considered to be of more value in the expansion of the college. This was the first time in the history of the University that a piece of land had been allowed to fall into the hands of an outsider.
 
November 22, 1952: Poor Yale-New Haven Relations Continue
 
Early in February this year, the Yale Daily News published a three-part article on the town-gown problem. The article concluded: "... every time a Town-Gown problem is solved, another seems to take its place--but they're growing smaller with each succeeding year."
 
On the morning of May 13 this year, a dispute over an ice cream vendor precipitated the biggest riot New Haven has seen since the bloody fracas of 1919. Over 1500 students and scores of policemen battled with pillows, water bombs, fire hoses, billy clubs, and drawn revolvers.
 
For two centuries, Yale and New Haven have periodically come together in gory frays that make their Cambridge counterparts look sickly by comparison. Guns, knives, and an aura of ill-feeling have permeated the town-gown relationship.
 
November 22, 1963: Death of President Shocks Cambridge
 
People in Cambridge were finishing lunch when they heard that President John F. Kennedy was shot, and at 2:15 they know that he was dead.
 
On Massachusetts Avenue groups clustered by car windows to hear the radio. Transistor radios were everywhere. Students greeted each other with "He's dead," and in the restaurants the few diners spoke in low voices.
 
In Harvard Square of students were standing by the Kiosk, waiting for the extras to begin to arrive. A man in painter's overalls was arguing with a policeman about putting the flag over the Coop at half-meet.
 
November 19, 1970: For Segal, Harvard-Yale Game Is Annual 'Schizophrenia Time'
 
Erich Segal sat in his suite in New Haven last Saturday night pondering the Harvard-Yale game. "That game is schizophrenia time for me," he said, reflecting on 11 years as an undergraduate and teaching assistant at Harvard.
 
The author of a phenomenally successful novel, "Love Story," Segal is now an associate professor of literature at Yale. But when Harvard and Yale line up Saturday in Cambridge, Segal will be far removed editing a new film in California.
 
The nerve-racking duality of The Game reached its apex for Segal two years ago when he came to Cambridge for the meeting of unbeaten Harvard and Yale teams. It was his last football game.
