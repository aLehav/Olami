After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The spotlight outlines the silhouette of a woman behind the curtain, her fingers spread in classic jazz style, striding closer and closer to the front of the stage until she emerges in full view. Clad in all black and sporting a top hat, Patina Miller reaches out and beckons to the audience to join her. The curtain collapses in the background, revealing an enchanting spectacle of hypnotizing acrobatics and high-flying performers with even higher-reaching voices.
It is June 2013, and the cast of “Pippin” is performing at the Tony Awards. Only five months earlier, “Pippin” dazzled on a much smaller stage at the American Repertory Theater, across the river from Boston in Cambridge, Mass. When the musical eventually moved to West 45th St. in New York City, its elaborate, circus-inspired set made way for a cherished collection of glass figurines in a simple, dimly lit flat, as Zachary Quinto and Cherry Jones took the stage in “The Glass Menagerie.” After two months at the A.R.T., “The Glass Menagerie” set up shop on the same New York block as “Pippin,” following in its predecessor’s path from the cobblestoned streets of Boston to the illuminated lanes of Broadway.
This trend of theatrical productions traveling from Boston to New York may seem an unlikely occurrence given the distinctive strain of competitive spirit that exists between the two cities. Whether they are debating the merits of the beaches on Cape Cod versus the Hamptons or feuding in the stadium at a Red Sox-Yankees game, Bostonians and New Yorkers have placed their hometown pride on the line in many a passionate battle.
Yet a tradition of partnership has evolved alongside the storied rivalry. The arts offer a unique example of a flowering cultural exchange and promising potential for collaboration across state lines. With both cities serving as intellectual and cultural hubs on the East Coast, it seems only natural that gifted artists and savvy innovators look to both cosmopolitan centers. In doing so, they are able to expand their audience reach and take advantage of the permanent collections of sister institutions and the fresh talent flourishing just a few hours away. From a New York producer investing in a Boston musical to a Boston curator joining forces with her New York counterpart to enhance an exhibit, both the dramatic and fine arts industries of the two cities have recently benefited from a particularized balance of individual and joint successes.
A TALE OF TWO MARKETS
Just shy of a century ago, the New York Yankees announced the team’s purchase of Babe Ruth’s contract after his six seasons in a Red Sox uniform. Following the controversial trade, Boston spent more than eight decades waiting to win the World Series, caught in the snare of the so-called “Curse of the Bambino.” Fortunately for members of the two cities’ arts industries, the transfer of shows between Boston and New York has become more of a lucky charm than a dogged jinx.
The thriving theater districts in both cities boast a rich legacy of interdependence, yet key elements distinguish the performing arts industries in Boston and New York. Since 1984, Broadway in Boston has presented more than 250 Broadway productions in local theaters like the Boston Opera House. The company hosts 20 to 30 weeks of programming each year, often featuring four or five touring productions. The theaters in New York typically stay lit through all 12 months, and each show vies with nearly 40 other Broadway stages, not to mention off- and off-off-Broadway, in an effort to fill its seats. “As far as competition for shows, the New York media and marketplace is definitely a tougher place than Boston,” says Ken Mahoney, a New York-based financial adviser and active Broadway investor.
Under the chandelier of a New York theater, amid the buzz before the overture sounds, a myriad of foreign languages and regional accents intertwine among the audience. The proportion of native New Yorkers in the crowd may be less than half on any given day. The Boston theater industry, on the other hand, caters to a vast majority of local theatergoers. Richard Jaffe, president of Broadway in Boston, adds that while Boston theaters may draw patrons from neighboring states like Vermont or New Hampshire, the city’s productions are not as significant a tourist attraction as New York’s theater market. According to the Broadway League’s annual demographics report, domestic and international visitors purchased 70 percent of Broadway tickets in New York’s 2013-’14 season.
Yet Jaffe perceives the Boston theater audience as a widespread representation of the region despite the city’s smaller population. “I’ve worked in many cities, and typically you see education and wealth as the primary categories of where your audience is coming from, and in Boston, we have a very egalitarian audience,” he says. “[The audience pulls] from everywhere, which I think speaks to the Boston community in that everyone is willing to come out and take in a Broadway show.”
A NEW DIRECTION
In spite of demographic and market variances, the two cities resemble each other in an important way: A strong appetite for theater prevails in both, including an eagerness to experiment with more challenging and less conventional pieces. “I think in both cities there is an audience for virtually everything,” says Steven Showalter, general manager at the A.R.T. in Cambridge. This common enthusiasm for the dramatic arts has led to an abiding, fruitful exchange between Boston and New York. Yet the curtain appears to have opened on a new relationship between the cities that departs from the traditional model.
“Boston’s pre-Broadway history has gone in various directions,” Jaffe says. In previous decades, Boston laid claim as the preeminent city where productions would host a trial run before descending upon New York. But Jaffe notes that Boston has not seen a commercial pre-Broadway show since 2006. According to Jaffe, this shift stems largely from a spike in national competition. States such as Illinois and Rhode Island have introduced theater tax credits to encourage pre-Broadway tryouts in their major cities, drawing producers away from Boston as a result. Jaffe is among the supporters of a proposed bill that would aim to restore the once dominant Boston-to-Broadway trend by introducing similar tax credits for shows that play in Massachusetts venues before settling in New York.
The frequency of official pre-Broadway trials hosted in Boston may have declined as of late, but New York still owes several of its most significant successes to the creative minds up north. Boston continues to generate novel productions, and many have found their names ultimately emblazoned upon a Broadway marquee. The A.R.T., in particular, has debuted a series of high-profile shows that have since started a second act in Manhattan, such as A. R. T. artistic director Diane Paulus’s “Finding Neverland.” “We all very much want to see our productions have as wide an audience as possible, so if a show ends its scheduled run here and can have a future life, then that benefits everybody involved, most notably the author of the play,” Showalter says.
PREDICTING ACT TWO
Both Bostonians and New Yorkers interviewed credit the vision of Paulus, the 2013 recipient of the Tony Award for Best Director of a Musical, with inspiring shows that simply demand to be seen. Indeed, numerous productions have succeeded in both Cambridge and New York with Paulus at the helm, though other shows at the A.R.T., such as John Tiffany’s staging of “The Glass Menagerie” and Bill Rauch’s direction of “All the Way,” have also successfully traveled the Boston-to-Broadway trajectory.
Mahoney worked as a producer for “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” and “Pippin,” two of Paulus’s musicals that began at the A.R.T. and went on to capture Tony Awards as Broadway revivals in 2012 and 2013. Mahoney suggests that commercial and critical success in Cambridge and Boston frequently serves as an auspicious precursor to a future in New York. “If something really runs well in Boston and gets good reviews, it has a really good chance of making it on Broadway,” he says. “The transfers that came from Boston to New York seem to have a higher success rate than others, at least from what I have seen in the last few years.”
Situated a little more than 200 miles apart, the proximity between the two cities increases the chance that both patrons and press will travel from New York to see a show in Boston. Mahoney added that the relative ease with which New York media can review a Boston production is particularly vital, as a show that initially garners encouraging reviews from critics will likely see similarly positive reviews after its transition to Broadway. According to A.R. T. spokesperson Anna Fitzloff, success has grown increasingly challenging to predict within the theater industry, and critics’ praise is no guarantee of a Broadway embrace. “[Success] is very largely word of mouth driven now,” says Fitzloff. “A large percentage, I think, is about whether or not an audience feels passionate about a piece and whether they encourage others to see it. That is really where I see success for us locally,” she adds, positing that this newer word of mouth model expands significantly in as large a market as New York.
Showalter is quick to point out that Broadway is by no means the sole destination for A.R.T. productions after closing shop in Cambridge. After spending multiple years writing and developing shows, he admits that commercial success on Broadway is a welcome finale, but the difficulty of predicting such an outcome means that the possibility does not often influence the decision-making process at the A.R.T. “If we all could be so lucky as to have the Broadway piece, that’s great,” he says. “[But] a lot of times shows will leave here and they’ll go and be regional, or play in high schools or play off-Broadway or elsewhere, and all of that is beneficial to the industry as a whole.”
A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC
This frequent interlacing of the two cities’ theater scenes represents an intimate affiliation that is not always replicable in other artistic domains. The link between the fine arts industries in Boston and New York is much less defined and one in which such explicit creative exchanges are more the exception than the rule. Yet the artistic history of the cities has followed a rather parallel path. According to Teresa Carbone, the curator of American Art and managing curator of arts of the Americas and Europe at the Brooklyn Museum, the two cities came of age artistically around the same era, with much of their thriving art scenes sharing similar origins in the Gilded Age. New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art opened its doors in 1870, and Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts was unveiled in 1876. Additionally, both cities have benefited of late from the burgeoning popularity of the visual arts and history. Shawna Cooper, associate director at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York, says Boston and New York have each seen growing museum attendance and an increased focus on audience experience since 2000.
Greek and Roman statues peer down from behind glass enclosures on the floors above, silently observing the mix of students, academics, and artists scattered throughout the indoor courtyard of the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums in Cambridge. Sitting at one of the café tables in the courtyard, Elizabeth Rudy, assistant curator of European Art at the Museums, says that the relationship between the arts in Boston and New York can be rather complicated to discuss.
“We do collaborate a lot through loans,” says Rudy, who spent three years as a curatorial fellow at the Met. “We lend to the Met quite regularly, and they make frequent requests of us, as do other institutions in New York.” Such temporary loans strengthen the ties between Boston and New York institutions, as certain pieces of artwork commonly grace the galleries of museums in both cities. The MFA’s celebrated Paul Cézanne piece, “Madame Cézanne in a Red Armchair,” currently occupies a prime position in the Met’s “Madame Cézanne” exhibition, while the MFA’s recent exhibit “Goya: Order and Disorder” included multiple works from the Met and the Hispanic Society of America in New York.
Yet more extensive collaboration remains uncommon. While geographic proximity facilitates artistic exchange within the theater industry, curators in New York and Boston look to avoid repetitions of similar content, as both cities aim to attract a broad audience from throughout the Northeast. “Even though the cities are about three hours apart, there is a sense that you wouldn’t want to draw on one another’s audience for a major exhibition,” Carbone says.
CO-CURATING SUCCESS
When they do occur, however, larger-scale artistic partnerships have proven highly rewarding for establishments in both cities. The MFA and the Brooklyn Museum house the two largest collections of John Singer Sargent’s watercolors, and the 2013 exhibit “John Singer Sargent Watercolors”—co-curated by Erica Hirshler of the MFA and Carbone at the Brooklyn Museum—resulted in the grand display of more than 90 watercolors tracing Sargent’s journeys through the Mediterranean and Middle East. “If it is a good story, then [a co-organized exhibit] is worth doing,” says Carbone.
The Sargent exhibit was indeed a good story in Carbone’s view, in that it not only presented a fuller portrait of Sargent’s artistry but also embodied the history of both collaboration and competition between Boston and New York. At the time of Sargent’s original watercolor showings, the MFA and the Brooklyn Museum were both fledgling institutions with ambitious plans to bolster their collections at the turn of the 20th century, but it was the Brooklyn Museum that succeeded in purchasing the entirety of Sargent’s 1909 watercolor exhibition in New York and Boston. “There was also a sense of competition at the time,” Carbone continues. “When Brooklyn bought our body of watercolors, Boston had been thinking of doing it but didn’t move quickly enough, which is why Sargent then prepared a second body of watercolors for Boston to purchase.” Having been shut out three years earlier, the MFA quickly claimed the complete contents of Sargent’s second show, securing its acquisition in advance of the exhibit’s formal opening in 1912. The co-curated exhibit in 2013, which ran in New York and Boston, witnessed the first unified display of the two watercolor collections in history.
Alternative modes of collaboration bridge the separate art industries, as well. Tony Sigel, conservator of Objects and Sculpture at the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies at the Harvard Art Museums, notes that new techniques in conservation and restoration developed at the Straus Center are frequently shared with establishments in other cities. “Our mission in education is not simply to our own students and faculty and people who attend the museum,” he says, explaining that the Cambridge institute participates in a global dialogue on the role of conservation in the contemporary art world.
Cooper adds that the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery represents more than 35 artists and assists in arranging their exhibits at institutions in New York, Boston, and beyond. While New York has long been heralded as an international arts capital, Cooper lauds the increasingly global perspective adopted by Boston museums, including the Institute of Contemporary Art. “They are looking at the contemporary world outside of Boston, and they’re drawing talent on the curatorial side, in addition to looking at artists who communicate subject matter that people in Boston would be interested in and who are also very strong contemporary artists internationally,” she says.
CULTURAL KINSHIP
The relationship between museums in Boston and New York extends beyond the pages of a curator’s catalogue. “It’s a very collegial and friendly relationship we have with our partners down there [in New York],” Rudy says. Like all friendships, this sense of institutional comradery assumes added significance in challenging times. Following the bombings at the Boston Marathon of April 2013, art emerged as an emblem of hope and the solidarity that exists not only between the cities of New York and Boston but also among their respective art institutes.
According to MFA spokesperson Karen Frascona, the Metropolitan Museum of Art expressed support for its kindred institution and for the city of Boston within hours of the attack when the Met’s director and Chief Executive Officer Thomas Campbell offered to lend three paintings to the MFA. “The Met wanted to show support for its sister institution during this challenging moment for the people of Boston,” Campbell said in the MFA press release. “I hope the works of art we have lent will help the city’s recovery in some small way.”
When the pieces by Homer, Leighton, and Manet ultimately debuted at the MFA Memorial Day weekend, they became part of the greater history enveloping these two great cities. It is a history that encompasses centuries of competition and collaboration between the artistic epicenters–one that often changes in nature, yet remains rooted in a tradition of mutual respect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maria kept dreaming smoke was a man, his knee on her stomach, hands crushing her throat. When the men from the insurance company came, she saw that they had the same kind of hands, used to touching. The insurance men had said they’d call soon, and Lai had frowned as their boots left the house. Maria, too, had been unaccustomed to his no shoe policy when they’d first moved in together, and how the cutlery drawer was divided into half chopsticks, half forks and knives, and the dampness his newly washed hair imprinted on the bed before they slept.
She had been hungry but didn’t want to spend any time at the stove. One of the burners still worked. Lai had made eggs the other day. Otherwise, they mostly ate soup. She microwaved a bowl and brought it to him. She hadn’t left it in for much time; it was barely warmer than her fingers. She’d been afraid. She kept envisioning microwaving it for too long and dropping it on her way to Lai, scalding vegetables and shards of porcelain everywhere. Crusted on top of the ash, which they’d been instructed not to touch, so that the insurance company could make a more accurate estimate.
“Thanks,” Lai said when she set it down next to him. He blew at the screen, clearing away more dust she couldn’t see. He was between stories and so was roving around online. She’d asked him, a few times, if being between freelance gigs felt like being unemployed. He’d told her a little. He’d said that it wasn’t like what she was doing, though, taking a few months, then half a year, then an entire year to assess what she wanted with her life before finding another job. It wasn’t like that at all.
“Do you have a new story?” she asked, wedging herself in front of the desk onto his lap. His hands circled her hips.
“Not really. Here, let me eat, that’s going to get cold.”
She straightened some of the papers around his keyboard. Rough drafts, different colors of pen crawling out of the double-spaced text into the margins. The pages were out of order. She recognized the article as his most recently published one. It had gotten some attention—not a lot but enough that at a friend’s party one night he’d drunk too much and made out with her on the couch behind a piano, like a teenager, his tongue feeling new in her mouth, warm, sour. She started to shuffle the papers into the correct order but settled for aligning all the corners instead.
When she turned back to him, his hand was holding the spoon halfway to his lips. His eyes were closed. The curves around his mouth gouged into his face, frozen.
“What’s wrong?” Maria said.
The exhale he gave her moved a strand of hair across her forehead.
“Is it the soup? I can heat it more.” She was aware her body was rigid. The air through her nostrils was like cotton. Her heartbeat pushed hard against her ribs, and she wondered if this was a heart attack.
Later she would hate how he spoke like each word cut coming through his lips. Would remember how they felt leaden at the time, but that the dull weight just kept settling, heavier and heavier.
She would hate how he looked like he was about to cry. Would hate that he followed her out of the office back to their bedroom, where she would stand in front of the window. The ash hadn't touched this part of the house, but she wished it had so she could've focused on each little gray speck, the way it lightened on the side closest to the window, the jagged irregularity, how they had fallen in the pattern of the air currents at the time of the fire. But the windowsill was untouched, white, the marigold curtains she and Lai had installed when they'd moved into this new house together stretching a shadow along the wood. If it had snowed this year, there would've been tracks outside left by the fire trucks, the ambulance, the police cars, that Maria would've been able to see standing in the window, deep ruts in the face of late December snow, thawed and refrozen across several days until it glazed over, hard and blinding in the sun. But the lawn was brown. There’d been no snow, only cold that pulsed on the window to the timing of Maria’s breath. Her hands felt heavy at her sides, her fingers stiff but filmed with sweat. Lai was behind her, so quiet she could almost forget his toes that dug into the carpet when he was distressed, the mouth that melted downwards, the eyes on her back that really wished to be back downstairs in the safe, blue hutch of the computer screen whose hum was probably—she realized now that he’d told her he was asexual—warmer than she had ever made him, rather than here, up by the sharp light of the window from which they looked onto the sad, unhidden lawn outside they’d worked so hard to manicure each summer, through which enough of the chill reached inside that she felt it down her spine and hoped that he felt it too. “How long have you known?”
“Before I met you.”
“Why are you telling me now?”
“I’m sorry.” She heard his feet on the stairs, the door to his office close. She wondered if he was eating the soup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On “Open Book,” the concluding track of José González’s “Vestiges and Claws,”the Swedish-Argentine troubadour waxes poetic on humanity’s limitless potential, singing “I know there’s so much left to see / I know I have so much left to give.” But despite two stellar LPs and unwavering audience anticipation for his latest release, González is giving too much of the same to truly embody the latter of the two notions. Having spent the almost eight years since his last solo album touring with his alt-rock side project Junip and collaborating with a huge swath of indie rock’s biggest acts, González has had plenty of time to develop his musical sensibilities. And yet, though “Vestiges and Claws” is both melodically and lyrically stunning, the singer-songwriter’s third effort offers little in terms of emotional depth or any semblance of artistic innovation from his previous work.
As a whole, “Vestiges and Claws” is quintessential González—an array of hushed, pastoral indie pop, the singer-songwriter’s lilting delivery weaves through lush acoustic guitar and wood-block percussion. Similar to in his previous albums, “Veneer” (2003) and “In Our Nature” (2007), González once again imbues his tracks with a dreamy eeriness—his voice glides in and around the melody, and his sing-song tone directly contrasts with more foreboding lyrics. As with “In Our Nature,” he decided to forego collaborating with a producer and instead recorded the entirety of the album alone in his home, a choice that elevates the quality of the tracks. The most memorable songs off of “Veneer,” including “Crosses” and the haunting “Lovestain,” are inflected with a hazy reverb; each sounds distant, its emotional heft tantamount to that of a fleeting memory. On “Vestiges and Claws,” however, every song possesses a marked clarity. It feels as if González himself is playing right at the audience’s bedside, making the album more intimate and listenable.
González’s latest work marks his first album of entirely original material, and his lyricism generally delivers. The album’s breathtaking opener, “With The Ink Of A Ghost,” may be its best; it epitomizes all of González’s most beloved qualities. The austere presentation, intricate fingerpicking of a single acoustic guitar, and a soft, flowing melody work in tandem to create a quiet, poignant meditation on the beauty of discovery. Additionally, the album demonstrates González’s uncanny knack for painting lovely images: in the ruminative “Open Book,” González describes how “I feel just like an open book.../ Against my will, a drifting vessel in the storm / Pushed around, from shore to shore.” On occasion, the singer’s instrumentation seems nearly identical to that of “Veneer” and “Of Our Nature.” His gift for expressing both his own struggles and brief snapshots of the world around him, however, constantly surprises.
But González’s attempts at tackling the deeper questions of the world—ones involving existentialism, humanism, and fate—often ring half-hearted, his ideas more tenuous than his own hushed whisper of a voice. His musings begin to take a somber turn on the “The Forest,” where he wonders, “Why didn’t I see / The forest on fire behind the trees.” As usual, González presents the listener with a striking image, but his ethereal melody and resigned delivery dulls the lyric’s intrinsic menace. More egregiously, the meditative “Afterglow” is essentially the line “All of this will be gone someday” looped for three minutes straight. It is moments like these where González’s passivity hinders his otherwise gorgeous work. The absence of any urgency, coupled with his inability to sound even remotely bothered by anything, instills doubt into the listener—all of this may be gone someday, but if Gonzalez doesn’t seem to care, should we?
Maybe it makes sense, then, that González’s most acclaimed and emotionally rich songs are covers—The Knife’s electro-pop ditty “Heartbeats” and Massive Attack’s ominous “Teardrop” are especially laudable. On these tracks, his haunting delivery and sparse instrumentation distill the lessons on life and love originally drowned under beat-heavy production. It’s only when the singer pairs his acoustic arrangements with his own lyrics—image-heavy but occasionally lacking substance—that he tends to falter.
In a world where indie artists constantly churn out new material in a desperate attempt to salvage relevancy, González remains nonplussed. He adamantly refuses to conform to the perpetually shifting trends and tastes of his core audience, and for that, the man deserves some credit. But while Gonzalez’s enduring ability to craft a melody may please his most dedicated followers, his continued reliance on minimalist arrangements and lyrics that barely skim the surface of pressing moral issues can be frustrating. González may say he cares, but to produce truly great material, he needs to sound like it too.

Sufjan Stevens is one of the great signs of contradiction in modern popular music, managing to be both the bleeding edge of folk music and a wild reactionary. His latest single, “No Shade in the Shadow of the Cross,” off his upcoming album “Carrie & Lowell,” drives this point home like no other song he has recorded so far. Violently Christian and filled with Millenial obscenity, the song straddles apparently contradictory worlds, inhabiting a deeply melancholy and liminal space of its own.
Delicate, unaccompanied acoustic guitar lilts rather than twangs as it did in much of his previous acoustic work (such as that on “Seven Swans” and “All Delighted People EP”). This suits the starkness of the lyrics, which are austere in a way that eclipses his previous morose songs (e.g. “Casimir Pulaski Day” and “Enchanting Ghost”), which have always had a touch of expansiveness. The imagery is tight, almost obsessive: “There's blood on that blade / Fuck me, I'm falling apart / My assassin, like Casper the ghost / There's no shade in the shadow of the cross.” The close tie between erotic and religious imagery and the plaintive, uncompromising summary would make a John Donne or San Juan de la Cruz proud. Stevens has outdone himself as a poet and set a difficult standard to meet on the rest of the his new album.
The strangest aspect of “No Shade” is the apparent earnestness and lack of irony in its lyrics. As far as one can tell, this is a genuine spiritual with a literal, true-blue Jesus obsession. The fact that it was released right before the start of Lent underlines this bizarre anachronism. Most critics have ignored or explained away Stevens’s Christianity; while it remains to be seen if the rest of “Carrie & Lowell” will cultivate this strain, this single makes it significantly more difficult to dismiss this Christian imagery as a mere device.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Public service awards and governmental investigations rarely pair well. Just ask Robin Steinberg, suspended founder and executive director of the Bronx Defenders.
Several weeks ago, the Women’s Law Association and the Law and International Development Society at Harvard Law School tapped Steinberg as one of 50 honorees for an International Women’s Day Exhibit. The event planned to display the portraits of the nominees for two weeks in the Law School’s Wasserstein Hall.
Then, long-brewing controversy came to a boil. In early December, The New York Post had reported the cameos of two attorneys from Bronx Defenders in “Hands Up,” a music video about police brutality that seemed to advocate retaliatory violence. Bronx Defenders scrambled into damage control, but uproar erupted, occasioning a month-long investigation by the New York City Department of Investigation. The examination found that Steinberg had lied about her knowledge of the video and neglected to punish the participating employees. Since then, the two attorneys have quit, and Steinberg has accepted a 60-day suspension.
Steinberg’s Cambridge award and her New York punishment collided this week when a New York Post article bashed the Law School exhibit. Within hours, the WLA and LIDS revoked Steinberg’s award, setting off a heated round of opinions that included a statement of support for Steinberg signed by more than 180 Law School affiliates.
No matter the size of the current controversy, one instance of directorial wrongdoing should not overshadow a career defined by dedication and, indeed, justice. Founded by Steinberg in 1997, Bronx Defenders provides legal services to over 35,000 needy Bronx residents every year. Steinberg also advocates for gender equality, and Bronx Defenders has a record of hiring and supporting women in the traditionally male legal profession. Viewed over the course of her lifetime, these facts make Steinberg a worthy honoree. Notably, the New York City Department of Investigation did not find that Steinberg knew of the content of the video in which her employees participated. In short, she is a fair-minded public servant, and no evidence indicates that she advocated violence against police.
At the same time, the selection committee clearly did not perform its due diligence in spotlighting Steinberg. Announced after reports of wrongdoing had already surfaced, the invitation was poorly timed and therefore regrettable. If the WLA and LIDS had qualms about Steinberg’s untruthfulness, as they should have, then the planners should not have recognized Steinberg at all this year.
After the initial invitation, however, it was inappropriate to rescind the offer, especially given the short period between The Post’s condemnation and the event planners’ decision. As loudly as newspaper headlines scream, they should not bully the WLA and LIDS into one decision over another. Caving to negative publicity was an act of anxiety, not discretion. Moreover, the explanation given by the Law School groups betrayed a lack of knowledge of the case. Though they referenced the possibility of Steinberg’s exoneration, the investigation is over and her punishment seems unlikely to change. If the groups feel that she is deserving of the honor despite her lapse in judgment, they should simply give it to her and explain that reasoning.
The events of the past two months have been regrettable at essentially every step of the way. WLA and LIDS were mistaken to honor Steinberg while her organization was under scrutiny, and were also wrong to withdraw their award simply because of public pressure and with an inadequate explanation. All groups at Harvard need to exercise care when choosing public figures to honor, and show resolve in the face of foreseeable objections. In this case, the WLA and LDS exhibited neither.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every Sunday evening I have the same exact Skype conversation with my parents.
After sending a thousand texts reminding me of our weekly appointment and after a thousand rings before she remembers how to answer, my mom appears on screen, framed by our photo-cluttered living room, sitting in her usual spot on the couch. She does all the talking, occasionally twisting the laptop toward my dad who is in his usual spot on his recliner. (My longtime girlfriend has seen my dad out of the recliner only once, which is to say nothing of his work ethic and everything of a life that has granted him the right to “sit in my recliner and watch Jeopardy for christsake.”)
Without fail I can only see the upper one third of my mom’s face. If I ask her to move the camera I’ll only be able to see her shirt. I’ve given up complaining.
She smiles and starts talking. I say “Press the button Ma, I can’t hear you,” and I see her say “Oh!” and then I hear her say “Can you hear me now?” and I nod and she leaps into the usual interrogation.
“Is it cold?” “Wow, do you need boots?” “You mean the boots we got before school started?” “Are those warm enough?” “Are you eating?”
Finally, “How are you doing?,” which she saves for last, since any necessity to panic about my well-being probably could have been determined by my answers to the foundational questions, and partially out of low expectations of my answer.
I say I’m fine, and leave it at that.
I ask her how their week went. She tells me whatever silly mishap she and my dad have gotten into. My dad broke his glasses, again, and repaired them by affixing one arm of my mom’s many colorful reading glasses to his plain black frames, so he looks like Frankenstein’s monster—again. For dinner they had fried fish and baked potatoes. It was so warm outside they got to wear short-sleeved shirts on their evening walk.
I know my parents aren’t going to bring up bills, or job searches, or dosage increases. They know I won’t bring up anything similar in my life, whatever that would be.
When I hang up after eight or so minutes of confusion and pleasantries and some genuine smiles, I can hear my suitemate talking to her parents on the phone about summer internships and final clubs and potential concentrations. I can’t help but wonder if I’m doing something wrong. I know that if I wanted to do that I’d have to first explain to my parents what an internship is, or a final club. When we talk about classes I keep it simple—I’m in English, history, French, and religion. They’re good classes and I’m working hard.
Which is not to say that my parents are unintelligent (whatever that means) or unaccomplished. It’s more than that. This is not their world.
Days after my dad’s high school graduation, he left for basic training. For him, his options were clear: Enlist or work in his brother’s auto shop. He had worked in the garage for a while, and before that had driven a school bus, and before that was a caddy at the “Colored Golf Course” in his South Carolina hometown. He was ready for a change of scenery.
My mom knew it was advantageous but not necessarily practical to go to the local community college, and she knew that as a black woman her options were nursing or teaching. She knew that after helping raise all her siblings, she was pretty much over kids. She worked at the local Dolly Madison pastry factory at night to pay for nursing school during the day, and kept on helping with her siblings in the mornings and evenings, and that was totally revolutionary.
It was confusing for them when my older brother chose to go to the farthest in-state college from our hometown. It was borderline betrayal when I chose Harvard.
Here I have friends whose parents were avid members of college decision forums online, who took them on extravagant tours, who had admissions spreadsheets and files.
A few days after I was accepted, I asked my dad what he thought the acceptance rate was. He said, “I don’t know, 80 percent.” And I said, “Not quite. About 7.” “70?” “No, 7.”
I felt terrible for coming to Harvard. My financial aid package was incredible, but it did not say “zero dollars”, a figure at which my parents had sighed in relief at a couple of in-state interview weekends.
So far I think I love going to school here, but I am not going to apologize for thinking critically about what that means. I don’t know how I could torment my parents with the confusing and expensive sounding details, I don’t know how to tell them about the protests or the discussion groups, I don’t want to send them my columns because I don’t want them to think I’m unhappy here, or that their concerns were right and that I don’t belong here after all, and neither do they.
The first and last time my parents were here was move-in day, and the John Harvard statue scoffed at my sad old parents and our sad old things. They were both so tired and so sad to see me go. The next time they’re here will probably be commencement.
My parents have worked hard enough. I don’t want to burden them with any of the worries or insecurities or questions I have here. I want the next image they have of this place to be me thriving in it, walking across a stage and receiving my diploma. Ain’t that some belonging.
Until then, I’m warm enough. I’m eating enough, I’m happy enough, and my boots are keeping my feet dry. I’m doing just fine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 26, 2014, at 8:19 p.m.
I’ve been a student on campus for a little over a semester now, and I may have gotten breakfast in Annenberg a total of five times. It isn’t just breakfast that I skip; I often eat out or have a scheduling conflict and am forced to miss a meal. Out of the possible twenty-one plus meals I could be eating in Annenberg, I eat about twelve. The reason this is an issue is because we all pay for unlimited dining and there is no option to opt out. Given the high cost of the dining plan, Harvard undergraduates should be given more freedom in choosing a meal plan that suits their individual needs.
While unlimited food sounds like a wonderful paradise of buffets every day, the reality is not so dreamy. In the 2014-2015 school year, the meal plan contributed substantially to our annual bill, with room and board together costing $14,669. It is a large financial burden and for someone like me, it does not make sense to purchase all twenty-one meals per week when I only need twelve. Even the number of twelve meals is slightly inflated because I now have a higher incentive to eat in the dining halls because I have already paid for the meal. Anytime I want to eat out, I’m paying twice.
I understand Harvard’s goal of trying to “ensure that you can participate in every House activity on an equal footing with your peers” and it has some merit to it. Under this line of thinking, students who might be less financially stable now won’t have an incentive to eat less or feel left out of the dining experience, which admittedly is a very important part of our social lives. I can understand why minimizing social exclusion would be a top priority for a diverse, intellectually stimulating university like Harvard. However, this issue goes both ways. For the students who have spent the vast majority of their food budget on the meal plan, they feel either excluded or pressured to spend money every time their friends want to eat outside of the dining halls.
Additionally, I don’t think this is as large of an issue as advertised. Most of the students who might have an incentive to choose a smaller meal plan due to financial difficulties are covered by Harvard’s wonderfully generous financial aid program. As for any students who are not on financial aid, they currently have no choice but to pay the full amount even if they might not have the means to do so. This might be reasonable if everyone on campus who wasn’t receiving aid had boundless assets to spare. However, by only allowing the students in the middle one choice, the unlimited meal plan might actually be harmful to those that it was designed to help. I believe that the removed incentive to eat less is outweighed by the pressure the plan puts on those very people to pay for more than they need.
In addition to the high cost of uneaten meals, meal plan choice should be provided in order to give students more flexibility. There is nothing wrong with the food and service at our dining halls. I think that Harvard University Dining Services does a fantastic job operating each and every one of the meals they provide. However, everyone wants to switch things up every now and then. By forcing students to pay for every meal, Harvard is limiting the ways we can allocate our food budget. While the convenience of unlimited swipes is nice, many of us would trade it for choice and some savings on room and board.
The fix for this problem is quite simple: I recommend that Harvard offer tiered plans based on meals per week. Comparable universities offer a plethora of meal plans including zero, seven, eleven, fourteen, and yes, even unlimited meals per week. There is no reason why we can’t do the same thing. In order to address the University’s concern over students being on “equal footing,” I suggest that they continue to use financial aid to help low-income students and subsidize dining services for anyone who they deem might be inclined to opt out due to lack of ability to pay. Amid growing college costs, these changes will not only preserve Harvard’s inclusive spirit but also save many families hard earned money and provide some much needed freedom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent film "Selma" reminds us of the crucial role that black church leaders like Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. played in the fight for civil rights. The film also showcased Nation of Islam and civil rights leader Malcolm X, whose legacy proves that faith plays a leading role in the struggle for liberation. Despite their differences, the legacies of these two men were largely shaped by their religious values. People outside the black community were also driven by their own faiths towards the fight for racial justice. During the Freedom Summer, many white Jewish youth participated in this effort, pouring down from the North to help African Americans register to vote. These included Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, students from New York, who were brutally murdered by the Ku Klux Klan along with James Chaney, a local Congress of Racial Equality leader.
Recently, the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and other black individuals killed by police officers have brought national attention to the issue of institutional racism and the need for reform in our nation's judicial system. Many leaders within the religious community have carried the tradition of their predecessors and used their faith to bring an end to racial inequality. Last semester, Pusey Minister at Harvard's Memorial Church Reverend Jonathan Walton, preached a sermon at a die-in protest that called for students, faculty, and other members of the community to take a stand against racial oppression. However, there has been a clear racial divide among Christian clergy who have used the power of their pulpits to expose and expunge the racial injustices that have plagued our country for centuries. Similarly, too many Jewish institutions have been woefully silent, although organizations like T’ruah and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice have taken a strong stand, with many activists getting arrested in solidarity protests. Despite the arguably muted response from some within the Muslim community, many Muslim leaders have also utilized their efforts in combating issues of racial justice; activists such as Linda Sarsour, Mustafa Abdullah, and Faizan Syed, founders of Muslims for Ferguson, organized the Muslim community around issues of mass incarceration and police brutality.
Religious traditions have been the base of social justice and allyship for many movements in the past. It is crucial to revive this and make sure religious organizations are promoting the values espoused in their holy books of peace, justice and freedom. It is especially important in this day and age with such diversity and interconnectedness to emphasize solidarity between different communities and fight not only for your own rights but for those of people everywhere. As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. famously said, “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
Throughout the world, people have been embracing their duty to protect people of different racial or religious groups even when being persecuted themselves. In Pakistan in 2013, Muslims formed a circle around a church following a suicide bombing against Christians. In Egypt’s Arab Spring movement, the opposite took place, with Christians surrounding their Muslim fellow activists as they prayed amid the protests. After the recent attack on a synagogue in Denmark, Norwegian Muslims formed a “ring of peace” around a synagogue in Oslo. This past summer, Muslims in Gaza communicated with protesters in Ferguson via Twitter to give them advice on how to handle being tear gassed by the police. These acts of solidarity demonstrate the possibilities when communities of faith join together in support of one another.
We should start by trying to build solidarity between different religious, cultural, racial, and ethnic groups on Harvard’s campus. We need conversations about how our religious traditions and values motivate us to pursue social justice. Our religious traditions provide hope for a better world and the communities to walk with on our way there. It is important that we showcase what it looks like when we orient our religion towards what it’s really about—making the world a better place. In a world full of racial and ethnic struggle, it is critical that communities of faith take an active role in living out the value our traditions place on the dignity of human life. In that spirit, faith can ground organizing not only within our respective communities, but also across racial and religious bounds in solidarity. On Wednesday, February 25th, the Harvard Progressive Jewish Alliance, Harvard Black Students Association, Harvard Islamic Society, and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations are coming together for an event called “From Selma to Ferguson: Religious Tradition as Solidarity”. The event will feature veterans of the Civil Rights Movement and modern activists for racial justice from the Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities. It is our hope that this conversation will lead to more conversation and more action across religious communities on Harvard’s campus.
Sonya A. Karabel ‘18 lives in Matthews Hall and is a member of the Progressive Jewish Alliance. Lana A. Idris ‘16 is an African and African American Studies concentrator in Quincy House and the current President of the Harvard Islamic Society. Keyanna Y.

Call them tastemakers or trendsetters, fashion arbiters or brand evangelists. As more and more companies look to break into the coveted market of 18-to-22-year-olds, businesses are using college sudents to directly preach their gospels. Each year, brand ambassador programs attract thousands of eager college students looking to promote the “next big thing” at their respective institutions. Typically, students sign up for a flexible gig that provides cash, free swag, and a resume-boosting way to meet new people. In the process they also get to build up work experience and gain professional skills in marketing and brand development. It’s a smart strategy for companies as well. After all, what better way to build up credibility than by hiring cool college kids as living, breathing embodiments of your brand?
Apps
Nian Hu ’18 is a brand ambassador for Secret, a social media app that allows people to post messages anonymously within circles of friends or to the general public. “It’s like Yik Yak, but with a fox mascot instead of a yak,” she explains.
Looking to make some money during the semester, Hu, an active Crimson blog editor, found out about campus brand ambassador programs through a jobs and internships group on Facebook. After applying for a position with Secret, she heard back immediately. “Basically, with the phone interview I was already in,” Hu says. They paid her $250 at the beginning of the semester and will pay her another $250 at the end, with a bonus depending on the number of downloads on campus.
In terms of marketing, many brand ambassadors have a ton of creative license— they can advertise however they want, from hosting events to displaying the company’s promotional paraphernalia. As the snow whirled in torrents outside the window of Lamont Café, Hu shared the story of a fellow Secret ambassador who used the weather as inspiration for advertising: “Our logo is foxes, so she drew foxes in the snow along with the message, ‘download Secret app.’”
Repping an app is not an uncommon role for students. This past semester Nathaniel B. Horwitz ’18 was a brand ambassador for Classy, an app that facilitates a peer-to- peer student marketplace through a mobile platform. He describes it as “a Craigslist specifically designed for college campuses, where all of the buyers and sellers are also students on campus.”
Horwitz, an inactive Crimson editorial editor, relates the story of how he came across the position. “I was at a cocktail party on a Thursday afternoon when I met this venture capitalist,” he recalls. As it turns out, she was a part of one of the VC firms funding Blade, the consumer technology company that founded Classy. Taking a liking to Horwitz, the venture capitalist offered him a job: a 10-week position that paid $1,000 with $250 bonuses for extra work, like attending an app fair or getting more people to sign up.
At the time Classy had brand ambassadors at Boston University, Northeastern, and other schools in the New England area—but not at Harvard. They gave Horwitz several boxes of clothing and other merchandise in order to get the marketplace started. The rest of his job consisted, he says, of “general promotion of the app to friends and acquaintances, explaining what it did and encouraging people to engage.”
Once he got started, Horwitz was disappointed by the difficulty he faced when trying to engage his peers. “I generally encountered people who were enthusiastic about the idea, but who couldn’t actually be bothered to download [Classy] and upload items to the market,” he says. He believes that the market for apps is saturated to such a large extent that if a new idea doesn’t represent a breakthrough, it could easily get lost in a sea of other apps.
Hu echoes a similar sentiment. “I’ve been trying to get people to [download Secret],” she says, “but it’s not exactly the easiest thing to do.” Still toying with ways to increase brand recognition at Harvard, she admits that she is “kind of waiting for the weather to settle down first” before starting any serious brand promotion.
Overall, however, the experience has been a positive one for Hu. “It’s good, it’s fun, it’s pretty low commitment,” she explains. “A lot of people [represent brands] because it’s an easy way to be creative while also balancing coursework and extracurriculars.”
Clothing
Derek E. Ponce ’18 is a brand ambassador for Fresh Prints, a clothing design company that offers consumers deals for purchasing customized apparel in bulk. His role consists of both promoting the brand and convincing clients to switch from competitors.
Ponce radiates warmth and excitement about the product. “While I was interviewing with them, they told me, ‘If you get the position, it’s pretty much your company from here. We’re here to let you do whatever you want without having to worry about money or funding.’”
Much like Hu, Ponce also found out about the opportunity through social media. After applying and completing all rounds of the interview, he was offered the job. Now, Ponce is one of 50 Fresh Print campus managers worldwide, working to make college students aware of the deals offered by the company. In exchange for his work in marketing, he earns 7 percent commission on each deal he closes.
“My first impression was that they were going to expect a lot,” says Ponce. “They wanted to know about time commitment, if I was OK with reaching out to random people, things like that.” However, he was unfazed by the company’s expectations. Between speaking with the CEO, checking out the company website, and reaching out to organizations on campus, he’s made progress marketing Fresh Prints. “I enjoy being social, and the job isn’t a lot extra. I can do a lot of the work on my own time...and I think it lines up really nicely with my schedule.”
Skip L. Rosamilia ’17 operates on a more traditional schedule. He is the ambassador for Jack Wills, a British clothing company with 11 stores in the United States. “What’s unique about [Jack Wills] is that they don’t do any print publishing, so being a brand ambassador mostly consists of getting people to go into the store,” he says. Rosamilia, who is a former clothing model, is “supposed to wear the clothes a lot and channel the energy” of the company, run in-store events, and promote brand awareness, both in person and over social media.
Rosamilia started as an in-store sales rep with Jack Wills the summer after his senior year of high school. He stayed with them during his gap year and was promoted to supervisor before starting college. Because they knew he was going to Harvard, they offered him a marketing rep position on campus.
“I get paid $12 an hour, plus a $500 allowance at the beginning of each season to buy whatever full-price items I want—so that we get clothes to show off,” Rosamilia says. “At midseason, they give us an additional bonus to revamp our wardrobes.”
The job required Rosamilia to commit eight hours a week, half of which had to be spent in the store. “Finding that balance is really challenging,” he says. “The biggest thing about being a brand ambassador is realizing that people who aren’t at school run on a very different schedule than students.” Nevertheless, it has been an invaluable experience for Rosamilia. “The connections I made, the fun I had, being able to network, being the face of the company and being able to make these people aware of the brand, especially at Harvard...is really gratifying.”
Start-ups
Last semester, Belinda L. Zeng ’17 worked as a brand ambassador for Pymetrics, a start-up that “is trying to revolutionize the way we search for jobs.” Pymetrics matches students with compatible careers using a series of fun, neuroscience- based games. Students can sign up for free, play games, and get jobs offers in the process.
As the start-up’s brand ambassador, Zeng worked hard to talk to students about Pymetrics. Zeng went to the Office of Career Services to get their endorsement for the company, pubbed the site over various email listservs, and put up posters for Pymetrics in dining halls. She also met with the leader of the Pymetrics campus ambassador program to brainstorm different ways to make the company better known on campus.
Zeng joined term-time after having interned with Pymetrics, much like Rosamilia joined the brand ambassador program of Jack Wills after working there in the past. She described the role as “flexible” and “pretty low time commitment,” but was pleased with the results. Zeng received a $150 Amazon gift card for her efforts in promoting the startup. She was also happy to hear that a friend of hers got a job offer at a financial firm through the site.
As companies market through students, rather than to them, the ambassadors are able to tailor the brand towards their community of peers.
“As a brand ambassador, you inherit the reputation of the company,” Roasamilia explains. “I think that’s a very valuable lesson to have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a biology professor, curator of Entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the newly appointed director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, Brian D. Farrell has integrated his diverse passions into his multifaceted career and lifestyle.
The son of apple farmers in northern Vermont, Farrell developed a fascination with birds when he was young. He accumulated enough knowledge to serve as a teaching fellow for a course in ornithology, the study of birds, as an undergraduate at the University of Vermont. While camping in the mountains of New Hampshire and collecting insects one summer during college, however, Farrell fell in love again.
“I slowly felt myself being drawn to insects because of their amazing diversity of lifestyle, forms, and accessibility,” Farrell said. “There are insects everywhere and they don’t flee from you when they see you like birds do.”
Inspired by a professor in entomology who studied ground beetles, Farrell chose to study beetles that feed on plants so that he could simultaneously study botany.
“I’ve felt breathless ever since with the joy of actually being able to make a living as a naturalist,” he said.
Farrell and his colleagues recently finished a six-year project of building the beetle tree of life.
“Beetles are one out of every four animals. They’re a huge piece of diversity,“ he said, explaining the various roles that they play in the environment as predators, pollinators, feeders, and parasites.
Farrell and his colleagues observed with surprise that beetle diversity parallels the trophic pyramid, which is a structure based on energy flow between organisms.
Farrell, along with several fellow scientists, recently received a grant from National Science Foundation to document all of the insect fossils in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard.
“We knew we had 30,000 fossils when we applied for the grant. That made us the second largest collection of fossil insects in the world, second after the institute of paleontology in Moscow,” Farrell said. “But we just found that we’ve got about 15,000 more that were in long-term storage, so we might be the number one.”
Farrell is also an avid lover of jazz. He integrates his passion for music and biology in his freshman seminar, titled “Why We Animals Sing.” He explained that the two main motives for singing are attracting mates and competing for territory.
“Music is not just sound. It’s about social cohesion as much as it is about mating. Social animals use sounds to stick together,” he said.
One of the courses that Farrell teaches through Harvard Summer School’s Study Abroad program, “BIO S-158: Biodiversity of Hispaniola,” is a microcosm of Farrell’s vibrant lifestyle. Not only do students explore habitats ranging from coral reefs to cloud forests, but they also play on drums at one of the local nightclubs with the professor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2015, at 3:07 a.m.
After the National Association of the Deaf filed lawsuits against Harvard and MIT alleging that the universities’ online content discriminates against the deaf and hard of hearing, some legal experts said they believe the suit has merit.
Filed earlier this month, the complaint alleges that by not captioning its online content, including content on edX, a virtual education platform founded by Harvard and MIT in 2012, the schools violate the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which requires that places of public accommodation are accessible to all.
While experts acknowledge that virtual places of accommodation—typically defined as any place used by the public—have little legal precedence, most said they believe that the ADA will extend to publicly accessible digital areas.
“I actually think that the plaintiffs are on very solid ground in saying that the online courses that are provided by Harvard serve as a place of public accommodation,” said Samuel R. Bagenstos, a law professor at the University of Michigan and an expert in disability law.
However, some still consider spaces in the virtual world a “gray area,” according to Rachael A. Stafford, a project director for the Rocky Mountain ADA Center and a lawyer.
Stafford questioned whether institutions providing online content were “acting as hosts of information” or as “part of a program or curriculum” that is “required viewing” material for students. She said that if the online content is serving as curriculum, it must be accessible to all students, but if the university is simply hosting information, there may be less precedence from previous ADA disputes.
Harvard Law School professor Martha A. Field disagreed with Stafford, arguing that in either case the university is required to caption the materials.
“It’s not a gray area,” she said. “It’s explicit in the ADA act that universities are covered.”
While institutions can claim that providing accommodations is too costly, Bagenstos said that this will not likely be the case for Harvard.
“Honestly, when you have a university like Harvard, with the endowment it has, it’s not going to be in a very strong position to say that providing captioning is too much of a burden,” he said.
Although some disability law experts said that the plaintiff's case is strong, Field said that she believes Harvard will put up captioning before the suit makes it to court.
“The university has to start captioning,” she said. “They’ll be silly if they litigate it all the way [to court].”
For Haben Girma, a 2013 graduate of Harvard Law School and disabilities advocate who is deaf and blind, the suit will provide  much needed access to many.
“I’m thrilled that the [NAD] is working to make Harvard and MIT more accessible,” she wrote in an email. “Students, faculty, and other community members who are deaf deserve access to the wealth of information Harvard and MIT place online.”
After declining to comment on the lawsuit in an email, Jeff Neal, a spokesperson for the University, wrote in an email that Harvard expects the U.S. Department of Justice to issue proposed rules in June for accessibility to virtual education and provide “much needed guidance in this area.” The University will “fully comply” with these rules, he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics have discovered a new category of binary stars, made up of one fully-formed and one undeveloped star. While most stars come in pairs of almost identical masses, this class of stars is a subset of extreme mass-ratio binaries, a commonly known exception to that rule.
Maxwell C. Moe and his colleague Rosanne Di Stefano, both CfA researchers, sifted through data from a project known as OGLE, the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.
“They stared, or OGLEd at the Large Magellanic Cloud satellite galaxy for seven years, just monitoring the brightness fluctuations of 35 billion stars,” Moe said of the researchers at OGLE.
Moe and Di Stefano worked to catalog extreme mass-ratio binaries from this data set for about a year before discovering 18 binaries that Moe initially classified as “weird outliers.”
“I almost threw them away from our dataset because we really didn’t understand them but after banging my head against the desk for a little while we finally figured it out,” Moe said.
These “outliers” proved to be a previously undocumented subset of extreme mass twin stars where one star is at least five times larger than its partner and one star is still in its pre-main sequence.  A star that is “pre-main sequence” is still contracting and compressing, Di Stefano said.
The two stars can create an eclipsing system, in which the less bright pre-main sequence star blocks the light of the main sequence star. This eclipse effect helped Moe and De Stefano locate extreme mass-ratio binaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kim Bernard, the inaugural Artist-in-Resident in the physics department, showcased her interactive kinetic sculptures, including bouncing concrete balls attached to springs and a harmonograph that draws patterns by swinging pendulum, at a talk on Friday, Feb. 20.
She also modeled shoes with springs affixed to the bottom and shared her sources of inspiration at the event, “Collision: Where Art & Science Meet,”  which drew attendees from the Graduate School of Design, Extension School, and the physics department.
According to Jacob A. Barandes, associate director of Physics Graduate Studies, her art attempts to access the “aesthetic realm of physics.”
Bernard began her residency this January, after several years of communicating and coordinating with members of the department. While neither party remembers who reached out first, Barandes recalls learning about Bernard’s exhibit in the Boston Sculptors Gallery in 2011 and realizing that her work could offer the missing artistic element the department had sought.
Bernard’s studio is located in Science Center 302. This semester, she will sit in on department classes, and attend workshops on machine, lasers, and nanoscale technology. She said she also hopes to collaborate with members of the physics community, especially students in “Physics 15a: Introductory Mechanics and Relativity,” who are looking for a non-traditional final project.
In the meantime, Bernard will continue to walk the line between the fields of science and art, she said.
“With physics, there is an answer to your pset: it’s right, it’s wrong,” Bernard said. “So you go through the steps as efficiently as you can, to arrive at the answer. With art, there’s no right or wrong, but there is a process that you go through and it is a creative process.... It is a different process that a different physics students go through at the yes or no answer.”

Advanced technology has made visualization an increasingly important tool for the life sciences at Harvard. BioVisions, an initiative supported by Harvard and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has worked for several years to encourage members of the life sciences community to use visualizations as they animate, simplify, and communicate complex research.
According to Robert A. Lue, the founder and director of BioVisions and a professor of molecular and cellular biology, the initiative will help students “learn the concepts of science more easily.
“It’s an opportunity for us to really bring visualization to students much faster,” he said.
According to Jacqueline M. Brooks, a student advisor for BioVisions, the initiative “has a huge impact on the student’s ability and confidence in teaching and communicating their scientific ideas.”
“It makes them better oral, written and visual communicators,” she said in an email statement.
BioVisions’ animations are used by more than just Harvard researchers. The visualizations circulate to high schools and other colleges and feature in museums and books. The initiative aims to make biological research more accessible to the general public, Lue said.
Timothy S. Hopper ’14, a human evolutionary biology concentrator and an HHMI Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Fellow in 2013, developed an animation on the mechanisms of human learning.
“The BioVisions project serves an important mission by making research more accessible to the public,” Hopper said.
“The rich media that is available online is so much more flexible and adapted to visual technique,” said Randy W. Schekman, a Nobel laureate and HHMI investigator at the University of California, Berkeley, who has used BioVisions visualizations in his lectures.

As part of a new pilot initiative, the Institute of Politics has brought veteran campaign manager Mike Vlacich to campus for its “Campaign and Advocacy” workshop series.
The series will allow 35 students to get hands-on experience with campaigning over eight weeks this spring, covering topics ranging from campaign finance to communications and analytics. According to IOP spokesperson Esten Perez, the students were chosen by the IOP earlier this month after an open house event and have varying backgrounds in political campaigns.
Vlacich, who served as campaign manager for New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen’s successful 2014 bid for reelection, said that he was attracted to the IOP because of its leadership and mission for Harvard students.
“I was really impressed with [the IOP’s] vision to provide a more hands-on, real-life experiential opportunity to understand campaigns, and not just look at it as a political exercise but as a means to achieve good and give people the common sense and tools to do so,” he said.
Vlacich said the workshops will aim to help students understand the accessibility of politics and prepare them for affecting change in the issues they care about.
“What I wanted to do was explain and help articulate that campaigns aren’t just what you see on TV,” he added. “It’s not just writing speeches and making television ads.”
The introductory workshop was held last Monday, and, according to Vlacich, included a discussion about the importance of voter-to-voter contact and the competition between grassroots field campaigns and “big money” in New Hampshire.
Perez said that the IOP hopes to organize a “campaign info session” at the end of the series. The session would be open to all Harvard students, and would feature representatives from different campaigns and organizations.

Reflecting on her journey from working-class family to head of state, former President of Finland Tarja Halonen spoke at the Institute of Politics Tuesday about her career in public service and Finland’s achievements in education, human rights, and sustainable development.
Halonen served as president of Finland from 2000 to 2012, and recently co-chaired the United Nations High-level Panel on Global Sustainability. She is currently the Angelopoulous Global Public Leaders Fellow at the Kennedy School, a position intended to bring leaders transitioning out of their office or position to Harvard in order to collaborate with researchers and meet with students for one semester.
Halonen spoke at length at the event about the “we” mentality of compassion and public service instilled in her by her parents, which she characterized as the “Nordic way.”
“Life is not always fair,” she said, quoting her mother. “But that’s why we are here, [to] make the world better.”
Halonen was born into a poor, working-class family near the end of World War II, an economic situation she characterized as “normal” for much of Europe at the time. She attributed a part of her own success and that of her country to smart investments in education and human capital, which she said have allowed Finland to maintain a world-class economy despite a lack of abundant natural resources such as oil and gas.
Halonen said that one challenge her country has faced recently in education is the issue of developing a “life of learning” and instilling curiosity in its citizenry, since much of the knowledge learned in academic settings can become quickly outdated in content and style.
“As soon as you will leave Harvard University, your education starts [to become] old-fashioned,” she said.
Reflecting on modern sustainability and environmental protection, Halonen said that informing the public of the conclusive academic work done regarding climate change is key to making a difference.
“Sustainable Europe is a modern trinity—we have to respect the planetary boundaries but we [also] have to put the people in focus, because they are the only ones who can make these decisions concerning sustainable development,” she said. “We have to empower them.”
Halonen also emphasized the importance of a cohesive and inclusive national community, especially in small countries like Finland, highlighting in particular her country’s progress in the area of LBGTQ rights.
“You are part of us—it’s your sexual identity, and you should have the right to bring it openly [without] any pressure,” she said. “We are all different, but we are ‘we.’”
The John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event, which was moderated by Kennedy School dean David T. Ellwood ’75, is part of the Kennedy School’s annual “Public Service Week,” which will culminate on Friday with a day of volunteer efforts in the Cambridge and Boston areas.

Three North Korean student defectors spoke about the economic and intellectual poverty in North Korea, how they managed to escape the country, and the importance of media dissemination for the transformation of North Korean society at an event at the Fong Auditorium on Tuesday.
The event was led by Woorihana, a sister organization of the Seoul-based North Korea Strategy Center that seeks to connect students from the United States with defector students from North Korea. It was co-hosted by Harvard Human Rights in North Korea.
Eunju Kim, who defected from North Korea on two occasions, first in 1999 and then in 2002 recalled how the government exerted complete control over the education system.
“When I was eight years old, I had to watch a public execution; it was part of the public education in North Korea,” Kim said. “We thought it was right because the government was doing this.”
Kim’s father passed away due to starvation during a famine that took place in the 1990s. Kim said she wrote a will when she was 11, expecting to die the same way.
“The day my mom came back home empty-handed [after spending several days searching for food], she said, ‘Let’s die together,’” Kim said.
Gwang Seong Jung, another speaker who defected to South Korea in 2006, noted the extent of government propaganda through media and education. He said he had spent the past five months learning English in the United States.
“In North Korea, they teach you to hate Americans, so we can’t learn English,” Jung said. North Korean students learn Russian instead, he added.
Kim noted that in China, North Korean refugees are considered illegal immigrants and are deported. Those who manage to avoid deportation, according to Kim, often work as exploited workers, and women can be subject to human trafficking.
Se Jun Park, the last of the defectors to speak, was a trained doctor in North Korea before he escaped. He described the poor conditions of healthcare facilities and the lack of adequate equipment and medicine, including bandages and reliable pharmaceuticals.
“Being placed in an environment where I couldn’t save lives, I felt a lot of guilt as a doctor,” Park said.
Park described working during electricity shortages. Doctors often faced power outages while performing surgical procedures.
“I have transitioned from being a doctor...to a North Korea human rights activist who works to fix an ailing society,” Park said.
Park spoke about the work of Woorihana and the impact that bringing external content to North Korea—in the form of smuggled USBs—has had in transforming the society and helping bridge the information gap.
“A movie from the outside will give North Koreans hopes and dreams,” Park said.
Sharon M. Stratton, the US program officer for the North Korea Strategy Center said that Woorihana is doing a speaker tour, starting off at Harvard, that will last a week and a half.
“We are focusing on increasing the awareness and participation from US students on the discussion of North Korean human rights,” said Stratton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 25, 2015, at 4:27 a.m.
Despite shutting down operations three times this semester in what has been Boston’s second snowiest season on record, Harvard has remained open more often than many other area schools, including Northeastern and Boston University.
Northeastern shut down for six days, while Boston University trailed close behind with five days of closures. Like Harvard, Boston College shut down for three days but also had a delayed start at 10:30 a.m. on a day when some other schools suspended operations.
Officials from all schools said that the safety of students and employees played a large role in their decision-making processes. While they acknowledged that the ability of employees to safely commute to campus is a priority, some disagreed about how the availability of public transportation factors into snow day decisions.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp said that because many of Harvard’s employees commute to the University by public transportation, MBTA closures make it very difficult for the University to continue operations. As at Harvard, officials at Northeastern said the closure of the MBTA was the primary cause of two different snow days.
“It’s not an issue of whether the students can get to class. We have 4,000 faculty and staff that live all over eastern Mass., some live in New Hampshire, some live in Rhode Island. We need faculty to teach and we need staff to run the institution,” said Michael Armini, Northeastern's senior vice president for external affairs.
Boston College spokesperson Jack Dunn said the school does not heavily consider the running of the MBTA in its decisions because its location in Newton, Mass., is relatively less accessible by public transportation. He said the main safety factors that Boston College considers include the safety of students and employees on campus.
Officials also reported different policies for making up lost class time lost due to snow days. At Harvard, individual instructors dealt with the cancelations in a variety of ways, ranging from holding makeup classes at night to hosting sessions over Skype, according Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris. There also exists no formal class makeup policy at Boston College, Dunn said.
Meanwhile, other universities have established a more formal system of making up classes. After six days of class cancellation this semester, Northeastern has now designated two days in April—which were formally school holidays—fully-operating school days. Boston University has assigned two Saturdays, Feb. 28 and March 21, as regular school days, when all classes will meet as if it were a weekday.

The RadioShack store located at 28 JFK St. is one of at least 1,784 RadioShack stores scheduled to close by March 31. These closures come in the wake of RadioShack’s declaration of bankruptcy on February 5.
According to court documents published by the electronics retailer, stores will be closed in three tranches, or waves. The first tranche contains 162 stores, which ceased operation on February 17. The second tranche consists of 986 stores that will close on February 28, and the final wave of 636 stores is set to shut down by March 31.
The store at 28 JFK Street is part of the third tranche.
Two other RadioShack locations in Cambridge will also soon be closing their doors. One is in the CambridgeSide Galleria and is a member of the second tranche. The other, part of the third tranche, is located at 15 White Street.
RadioShack employees declined to comment on the closure.
Another retail store in Harvard Square, The Body Shop—which specializes in skin products and other toiletries—also closed its doors this month.

After a series of severe snow storms, crime in Cambridge for the month of February is headed for historically low levels, according to Jeremy Warnick, a spokesperson for the Cambridge Police Department.
“At the current rate, we are anticipating February to be at historic lows,” Warnick said. Specific data on crime were not available for February 2015 on a database of monthly reports on the CPD’s website.
Warnick said that the shutdown of the MBTA, as well as of certain roads and many businesses, might have been a contributing factor in the noticeable decline in crime. He added that the recent severe snow storms blanketing the Boston area, fewer public events and crowds, and reduced traffic led to fewer opportunities for crime to occur.
Warnick also said there seemed to be a correlation between inclement weather and drops in crime. According to data on the CPD’s website, rates of crime during winter months appear to trail those during warmer months in the year. There were a total of 267 violent and property damage-related crimes in August 2014. In contrast, there were only 162 such crimes in January of this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After repeated requests from faculty members, University President Drew G. Faust has agreed to host an open forum this spring “on how the University can best embrace its essential role in confronting climate change,” according to her spokesperson, Jeff Neal.
Faust “reiterated” her plans to host the climate change forum this spring in a mid-December email to a group of 235 faculty members from across all of Harvard’s schools who have signed an open letter urging the University to divest from fossil fuels, Neal said on Tuesday.
Faust has repeatedly argued against the divestment of Harvard’s $35.9 billion endowment, even as campus voices in support of it have grown louder. Harvard affiliates, including the Divest Harvard activist group, have frequently demanded an open forum on climate change and divestment.
Another group, Harvard Faculty for Divestment, formalized its request for a forum in a Dec. 1, 2014, email to Faust and Harvard Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72 requesting that both “join us in a well publicized and well planned open forum this spring semester to discuss the university’s role in addressing climate change.”
After Faust replied with the proposed spring forum on climate change, the Faculty for Divestment group responded at the end of last semester with another email to Faust about the importance of discussing the University’s investments specifically, but according to Professor of Psychiatry James M. Recht and Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin ’59, have not received a reply to that message.
Neal wrote in an email that Faust received two emails from the group and responded to the first.
“No questions were asked in the final email she received and there was no indication that a response was expected,” Neal wrote.
Other emails sent last year by the group to Faust and Lee that are available on the group’s website were more explicit in their calls for an open forum specifically about divestment. This week, some members of the Harvard Faculty for Divestment Group, who said they they would participate in the forum Faust proposed, maintained that they wanted Faust to partake in a forum specifically targeted at the University’s investment in fossil fuel companies.
“It would be wonderful if the University were willing to hold this forum on divestment with us, but we don’t see any sign yet that that’s going to happen,” Recht said.
He added that the group hopes to hold an educational event in April at the same time a Harvard student group, Divest Harvard, plans to host a week-long sit-in to demand that the University divest from fossil fuels.
Some members of the Faculty for Divestment met formally with Faust and Lee for the first time last October in a “cordial” meeting to discuss their respective views, according to Marglin, but have not met with the administrators since.
Faculty have aired concerns about communication with Faust amid a flurry of divestment activity on campus. On Feb. 12, students from Divest Harvard occupied Massachusetts Hall for a 24-hour sit-in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2004, out of the 302 Harvard applicants to medical school, about 40 percent were seniors aiming to continue schooling directly after graduation. The remaining 60 percent were alumni who had taken at least one year off, opting to pursue projects such as a travel fellowship, a different graduate degree like a Master’s or Ph.D., a research project, a teaching or community service experience, or paid employment.
According to data compiled by the Office of Career Services on Harvard undergraduate medical school admissions, the majority of Harvard applicants to medical school have been alumni rather than seniors since 1999. Over the past decade, the gap between the number of alumni and senior applicants has only grown, with 82 seniors and 204 alumni applicants in 2013.
Robert J. Mayer, faculty associate dean of admissions at Harvard Medical School, also noted the trend of an increasing number of alumni matriculants at HMS.
“When I was a student, 80 to 85 percent of people at Harvard Medical School came directly out of college,” Mayer said. “I’ve been in the role of leading admissions for about 11 years. [When I first started], about 60 percent were coming out of college. Now, it’s about 35 percent.”
The data mark a shift in the perception of gap years before medical school as an opportunity to gain life experience before committing to the profession, to develop interpersonal and scientific skills, and to bolster an application’s chance of success, students and Medical School officials say. Still, despite active encouragement of behalf of both pre-medical tutors and advisers to take at least one gap year, some students still have reservations about delaying their education.
PUSHING FOR THE GAP
Pre-med tutors and advisers promote gap years to prospective doctors, saying alumni applicants can have an advantage in demonstrating to selection committees their readiness and dedication to the medical profession.
Avik Chatterjee, a Dunster House pre-med tutor, taught chemistry at a high school for two years through Teach for America prior to starting medical school. He called the experience “exceedingly valuable” and “something [he] wouldn’t exchange for anything.” According to Chatterjee, holistic admissions at medical schools like Boston University and Mt. Sinai can emphasize applicants’ life experiences over test scores, which would benefit students who take gap years.
“From my own experience supervising medical students and residents, trainees who have a few years of additional life experience tend to come across as more mature, professional, and interesting,” Chatterjee wrote in an email. “I've heard the same thing from senior faculty who sit on admissions committees.”
Mayer echoed Chatterjee’s sentiments, particularly noting that travel during time off can broaden students’ perspectives and indicate to selection committees a greater potential for success in a future medical career.
“I firmly believe that sort of [travel] experience makes it easier for them to relate to a larger population of patients,” Mayer said.
Matthew F. Basilico, a pre-med tutor in Adams House, agreed that the motivations for taking a gap year are consistent with desirable qualities in a potential doctor.
“If healing is about empathy and science, and empathy is about understanding human experience, then it makes sense that those most interested in medicine—and those most attractive to medical schools—will seek out broad human experience before entering the most technical portion of their training,” Basilico wrote in an email.
In addition, some peer-to-peer advisers have advocated for gap years, with Justin S. Reynolds ’17, director of the Harvard Pre-Medical Society’s Peer Mentoring Program, considering the endeavor a “great idea” that he “absolutely” recommends. Reynolds himself took three gap years between his freshman and sophomore year at the College to work as a medical assistant in an ophthalmology practice.
“In the fast-paced progression from being overachieving high schoolers to ever-catered-to Harvard students, pre-meds often lack the opportunity to mature in the less tangible ways necessary to become good doctors,” Reynolds said.
According to Mayer, the increasing proportion of alumni medical school applicants is not limited to Harvard or the Medical School. At the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, the majority of applicants are also college alumni rather than graduating seniors.
“We see that pattern even more from schools other than Harvard,” Mayer said. "There are some schools that advise applicants to do something for a year or so.”
AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE
On the other end of the conversation, College students have increasingly accepted gap years between their undergraduate and medical school educations as common practice that can give applicants more time to pursue other endeavors or polish an application with little repercussions for the delay.
According to Amarachi I. Erondu ’15, a pre-health peer liaison, students hear the message that time off does not hinder an applicant’s chance for success.
“The stigma around taking a gap year is dissipating,” Erondu said. “Med schools are trying to make it clear that they accept alumni.”
Students have said the increased acceptance for taking a gap year better enables them to consider it as an option upon graduation.
“I have gotten the feeling from speaking with upperclassmen as well as pre-med advisers that it has become much more common to take a gap year before medical school,”  Yasmin Siraj ’18 said. “I do not know if I want to take a gap year or not, but now I know it is an option that is very much accepted in society today.”
Erondu also noted that taking gap years can allow for “a nice break” after four years of pre-med education, what she called an “attractive option.”
“It’s a great way to space out your pre-med requirements,” Erondu said. “You can take one pre-med class a semester.”
Harvard alumni were accepted to medical school with significantly lower GPAs than Harvard seniors, an average of 3.59 for alumni and 3.77 for seniors in 2013, according to admissions data compiled by OCS.
Assistant Director of Premedical and Health Careers Advising Sirinya Matchacheep said that while taking a gap year cannot directly make up for a lower GPA or MCAT score, individuals can take post-baccalaureate courses to boost their academic standing.
AN INDIVIDUAL DECISION
In the face of institutional and peer recommendations for time off, the decision to take time off still stands as largely variable from person to person.
For students who want to go straight to medical school, have strong grades and accomplishments, and are not considering any other endeavors, applying in their junior year would be the best option, according to Chatterjee.
Grant A. Sprow ’16, who intends to apply to medical school during his senior year, said he decided on medicine early in his college career.
“I just didn’t feel the need to take time off between college and medical school,” Sprow said. “A lot of other people have other interests and want to take the opportunity to pursue another interest and get work experience.”
Ved V. Topkar ’16, who hopes to pursue a M.D./Ph.D. program that typically takes about eight years to complete, said that he did not have time to take a gap year considering the program’s length, but strongly considered a gap year when he only planned on achieving a M.D. degree.
“I saw a lot of my classmates here having taken gap years before or during college careers...grow as individuals,” Topkar said. “Having unstructured free time to help yourself grow as a person...was the main draw for me.”
In the end, Mayer said that students should not feel pressure for either continuing straight to medical school or taking a gap year.
“What’s so important is that there is good mentorship,” Mayer said. “People are leaving the uterus, the womb of college, and now need to make some decisions. We all mature at different rates.”

Alan M. Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, has again denied allegations of sexual misconduct with a then-underage woman, this time in an op-ed in the Harvard Law Record, the Law School’s student newspaper.
Dershowitz was first accused of sexual misconduct in a December court filing that is part of a civil case challenging a plea deal for Jeffrey E. Epstein, a billionaire and Harvard donor who went to jail for soliciting prostitution. That initial filing and subsequent iterations of the accusations allege that Epstein forced “Jane Doe No. 3” to have sex with Dershowitz in a variety of locations, including Epstein’s New York and Palm Beach homes. Dershowitz has continually denied the veracity of these allegations both publicly and legally, appearing before a number of media outlets and filing to intervene in the civil court case, to which he is not a party.
In the op-ed, Dershowitz responds to earlier criticisms of victim-blaming from two Law School students, Anna Joseph and Kerry Richards, who wrote on Feb. 18 that Dershowitz’s response to the allegations against him was “vicious and sexist.”
“Joseph and Richards have it backwards in this case. The 31-year-old perjurer is not my 'victim.' I am her victim,” Dershowitz wrote. “[T]he charges against me are not only totally made up but are provably untrue.”

Although a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who has come under fire amid conflict of interest allegations has no formal affiliations with Harvard, the scientist’s use of Harvard’s name on research has brought attention to the University amid the public controversy.
Wei-Hock Soon, the controversial researcher based in Cambridge who claims that variations in the sun’s energy can largely explain climate change, has accepted more than $1.2 million from fossil fuel companies in the past decade, according to documents compiled by Greenpeace. He has not disclosed the funding in multiple scientific papers, prompting recent scrutiny.
Soon, who is also called Willie, is employed part-time by the Smithsonian side of the center and has no formal affiliations with Harvard, according to Charles R. Alcock, director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Soon is not an employee of Harvard, and there are no records indicating that he has applied for or been granted funds administered by the University, according to a statement from University spokesperson Jeff Neal quoted in multiple news outlets.
According to W. John Kress, interim undersecretary for science at the Smithsonian Institution, Soon receives payment in the form of “soft money,” or grants and contracts from external sources. About half of the external funding that Soon solicited went to his salary, and the other half went to infrastructure and administrative costs of the center, Alcock said. At the center, Soon does not formally study climate change, according to Kress.
Soon did not respond to a request for comment on his relationship with and employment at Harvard.
Alcock said the center is investigating whether Soon has violated open disclosure policies of several journals to which he has submitted articles, though he declined to say how they will discipline Soon should the allegations be found true. For now, Soon is continuing his research on solar variability at the center.
Although Soon is not a University employee, he has a Harvard email address and is searchable in the University’s public directory, and his name association with the University has prompted onlookers to turn to Harvard for a response. Soon has listed his association with the Harvard-Smithsonian on research on climate change in question, and some news outlets have referred to Soon as a “Harvard astrophysicist.”
Michael B. McElroy, a professor of environmental studies at Harvard, said it is common practice for scientists to submit journal articles without prior review by their affiliate organizations. Even so, McElroy said he thinks that Soon and Sallie Baliunas—a researcher with whom Soon co-wrote a paper—have used Harvard’s name inappropriately.
“The sense was communicated that this was a certified Harvard piece of work. But to my knowledge, neither one of them actually work for Harvard,” McElroy said.
In an emailed statement, Neal wrote that “Harvard takes the appropriate use, and the inappropriate misuse, of the University name very seriously. When made aware of a potential issue related to the misuse of the Harvard name, we communicate our expectations to the relevant individuals or organizations.”
Neal declined to comment on whether the University considers Soon’s case an inappropriate use of Harvard’s name.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said it is up to the due diligence of researchers to let a university know in what capacity they intend to use its name.
“Universities control their brand image very carefully,” Lake said. “If you are going to tag your work or statements to an institution, you have to be really careful that the institution is comfortable with that and accepts that.”
Lake added that he is unsure whether the allegations against Soon will hurt Harvard in any substantive way, but he said administrators should avoid a “knee-jerk reaction” to the controversy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It still does not look real, the image of former Penn football coach Al Bagnoli standing at a podium in front of a bunch of Columbia logos.
Bagnoli, in the foreground, is second in wins and conference titles in Ivy League history. He had three perfect seasons at Penn before calling it quits at the end of last season.
And now here he is in front of that light-blue WordArt arch of a logo? With the laughing lions that look like jesters (And they might as well be fools for smiling as Columbia has lost 21 straight football games).
This all can’t be right. It must be Photoshopped, like those photos of LeBron James wearing a Hornets jersey that circulated the internet this summer. Or like that Kim Jong Un Looking at Things meme.
But somehow, the image is real. Somehow that photo of Bagnoli wearing one of those laughing lions right above his heart is actually from Tuesday’s press conference in which he was introduced as Columbia’s next football coach.
The idea is shocking. Blow-dryer in the bathtub shocking. Kite in a thunderstorm shocking. WTF shocking.
This is nothing like ex-Harvard assistant coach Tony Reno getting his chance to lead a program by going to Yale. It’s not even like a gang leader switching sides.
A brief reminder of Columbia’s ineptitude: the Lions have not scored a point against Harvard since 2011. They haven’t won an Ivy title since 1961.
In the meantime, former Columbia coach Pete Mangurian became a meme himself, like Chuck Norris—except the opposite. His press conferences were increasingly dour, full of answers like “the problem is, you don’t play halves,” and “the day will come when [the score] won’t be 69-0.”
So Bagnoli’s decision to take the job is not just surprising because he is leaving Penn for another Ivy job. It’s where he has decided to go that leaves me stunned. It’s like Homer Simpson retiring from The Simpsons and then deciding he wants to go star on Bar Rescue. It’s your girlfriend saying she’s not looking for anything serious and then all of the sudden getting hitched with Oscar the Grouch. Unthinkable and impossible.
But it’s happening.
If you look at the move close enough, you can see some shrapnel of sense, bits of logic floating in an ocean of confusion. Newly hired Columbia Athletic Director Peter Pilling used to work at Villanova, across Philadelphia from Bagnoli. A mutual friend evidently connected them two weeks ago.
Bagnoli, at the time, was three months into an experiment in sports administration. Princeton coach Bob Surace told The New York Times Monday that he knew Bagnoli would not enjoy that line of work.
“I couldn’t imagine him sitting at a desk all day without just pulling his hair out,” Surace said.
And chatting over e-mail as he travels this week, Harvard coach Tim Murphy said he could see what Bagnoli found appealing about the Columbia job.
“I think that the best jobs are the one's where there is no place to go but up,” Murphy wrote.
That is certainly the case for the Lions.
As for why he left Penn, Bagnoli said, “At a certain point in time, you run out of challenges.” That should not happen for a long time in his new position.
Still, Murphy said he expects Bagnoli to turn the Light Blue ship around and become “very competitive” within three years.
We have certainly given Columbia some abuse of late, but in three years, maybe the Lions will have joined the league’s royalty. The basketball team, title-less since 1968, appears headed in that direction after upsetting Yale this weekend with a better roster expected next year. And now with Bagnoli headed to Kraft Field, the football team could get there too.
Welcome to the Age of Columbia Athletics, I guess.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some call it the second season. Technically, it’s called the ECAC Quarterfinals. But for the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team, this weekend’s series matchup is a chance to get one step closer to its ultimate goal of a national championship.
The Crimson (21-5-3, 16-4-2 ECAC) will face off against Yale (15-13-1, 12-10-0) at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center in a best-of-three series that will decide which team gets the opportunity to move on to the ECAC semifinals next weekend.
Harvard is coming into the series after finishing up its regular season campaign last Saturday with a 1-0 loss to ECAC rival Clarksont. The loss pushed the Crimson out of the top seed in the conference standings and allowed the Golden Knights to stake a claim in a share of the ECAC title.
“This series is a fresh start for us in a way,” senior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “If we get too wrapped up in the thought that we ended the regular season on a loss…we’ll end up gripping our sticks a little too tightly and getting a little too nervous. We just need to play our game and we’ll be fine.”
The loss to Clarkson was the first time that Harvard had been shut out since its 1-0 loss to Princeton on Jan. 31. Since then, the team has averaged over four goals per game in the month of February, heading into this weekend’s matchup with a 6-1-1 record over the past eight games.
The Bulldogs have been riding a similar win streak coming into this weekend’s series. Yale has won five in a row, the longest win streak for the team since the 2004-2005 season. The streak includes wins over Quinnipiac and Princeton, teams that are both ranked higher than Yale in the ECAC standings.
“We always watch video of our opponents so we can look at their tendencies and see their specialties, but other than that we are just going to play our game,” junior forward Miye D’Oench said. “It doesn’t really matter who comes to play us, as long as we play our game and play for each other we’ll be okay.”
Harvard is throwing its best defensive effort at the Bulldogs. During the month of February, the Crimson has surrendered one goal a game on average, and over the course of the season, that number is only slightly larger at 1.58 goals allowed per contest.
In the net, Harvard has mostly relied on the skills of junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who has been solid for the Crimson all season, tallying a .937 save percentage over her 19 games between the posts. Her save percentage lands her in second place among all goaltenders in the ECAC, just a few ticks behind Clarkson’s Shea Tiley.
“Last weekend Emerance played really well in both games, and we’re confident that she’s going to make the saves we need her to make,” D’Oench said. “Everything is a little bit easier when you know your goalies will come through on the ice.”
D’Oench and sophomore forward Sydney Daniels have been leading the offensive pack for Harvard as of late, each tallying three goals over the past five games. D’Oench was responsible for the power play goal that lifted the Crimson over Boston College in the Beanpot championship game Feb. 10, and Daniels tallied the goal that kept Harvard in contention for the tie against St. Lawrence last weekend.
For the Crimson, this series marks the beginning of a new phase of play in which maximum effort must be given on every line and no opponent can be taken for granted.
“In the back of your mind I think everyone feels a little different during the playoffs,” Fry said. “When it comes down to it we need to remember to stay true to our game. Every team we play from now on is going to be good, every game is going to be a great game, and we need to play start to finish.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After its thrilling come-from-behind win against Princeton, the Harvard men’s basketball team (19-5, 9-1 Ivy) stands alone atop the Ancient Eight. Joe Lunardi, who has had the Crimson in his bracket since Harvard won in New Haven, has projected the Crimson—which holds its fate in its own hands—to be a 12 seed for the third time in four years, playing Wichita State in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Here’s what some other outlets have been saying about the Ancient Eight race as it heads towards its conclusion:
Ken Pomeroy: College basketball’s most famous statistician has the Crimson as the 67th best team in the country, roughly unchanged from previous weekends. Harvard was ranked in the top 40 early in the season, but losses to Holy Cross and Virginia knocked it down several rungs. Yale remains in the low 80s (currently 81) after losing to Columbia, which the model sees as the third best team in the conference.
Vegas: While I couldn’t find any source telling Harvard’s odds of winning the Ivy League—@ivybball pegged the odds of a solo victory at around 90 percent—Vegas online sportsbook Bovada gives the Crimson 500/1 odds to win the national championship. Oddly enough, it gives Georgia Tech the same odds but has suspended bets on that channel. Per vegasinsider.com, the Crimson has been a sloppy cover, going just 8-10 on the year and failing four times to cover spreads of at least nine points.
ESPN: In ESPN: The Magazine’s latest issue, Jordan Brenner and Peter Keating identified Harvard as a ‘Generic Killer’ type of underdog for the NCAA Tournament. Grouped with Xavier, the Crimson was pegged as a tough matchup for Generic Giants Northern Iowa and Oklahoma. Lo and behold, the Sooners are the fourth seed in Harvard’s projected region.
CollegeInsider: Before the season, we took a look at whether Harvard would be the top mid-major program in the country if you stripped out “name only” mid-majors like Wichita State. The performance this year has not given the Crimson a credible claim to first, as Harvard ranks seventh in the latest mid-major top 25, five spots below Yale and directly below Murray State, Valparaiso, and Stephen F. Austin.
