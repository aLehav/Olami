After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An unidentified man allegedly solicited donations at the Kennedy School of Government on Tuesday for what he said was a charity connected to the Islamic State.
“He has not been seen on campus since, and there does not appear to be a threat to the community at this time,” Kennedy School spokesperson Doug Gavel wrote in an emailed statement. Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 and Executive Dean John A. Haigh notified affiliates of the incident via email on Thursday.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that police are investigating the incident and declined to comment further.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sharply condemned a controversial party invitation that circulated among undergraduates over email this week, writing in an email to the student body that its contents—which the Spee Club sent to advertise a Saturday party—were “offensive, crude, and sexist.”
On Thursday, the Spee, an all-male final club located on Mount Auburn Street, issued an apology for circulating the invitation, which included an image titled “Playbear” and linked to a since-removed YouTube video that featured multiple clips of women wearing underwear and models walking on a runway.
The invitation drew criticism from some students who said its depiction of women was objectifying. Vince T. Cooper ’15, whose email account sent the invitation on Wednesday, emailed recipients on Thursday night apologizing for what he called a “genuine lapse in judgment regarding Saturday's invitation.” Cooper later wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Spee hopes to hold an open forum with female final club members to discuss concerns raised by the invitation.
In an email to undergraduates Friday, Khurana did not identify the Spee by name, instead referencing an “all-male unrecognized student group.” He wrote that he received an image of the invitation and said that it did not align with the College’s values.
“I am troubled by the lack of judgment shown in organizing and promoting this event, which runs counter to the values we hold as a community,” he wrote. “I am concerned as a member of the Harvard community because sexism and bigotry are antithetical to our fundamental values as an institution.”
Khurana urged students to send him feedback on the invitation over email or through the Twitter hashtag “#crimsonrespect.” At least one administrator’s Twitter account, assistant dean of student life for public service Gene A. Corbin, sent out a statement using the hashtag.
Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 commended Khurana for addressing a topic she said administrators do not typically openly discuss. UC representative Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said Khurana’s email appeared to reflect the demands of undergraduates who voiced concerns over administrators’ response to several hundred students’ receipt of emailed death threats last semester.
“This email from Dean Khurana reflects that pressure from some students [for administrators] to take note of something like this, and not just take note of it, but take a position,” Biebelberg said.
Through Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven, Khurana declined to comment beyond his email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 7, 2015, at 12:35 a.m.
The Harvard men’s ice hockey team entered postseason play on Friday with a new look on its second line. So far, it looks good.
In just his second game on the Crimson’s second line after an extended injury, fourth-year right wing Colin Blackwell scored twice as sixth-seeded Harvard (16-11-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) beat 11th-seeded Brown (8-19-3, 5-14-3), 6-2, in Game 1 of the first round of the ECAC tournament. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey also had two goals and an assist to help the hosts pull away early.
“We were able to play with a lead and play an intelligent hockey game,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[We did] not have to reach and take a lot of chances once we got the lead.”
After drawing an interference call on a rush up the wing, Blackwell found the back of the net for the first time in months. The San Jose Sharks draft pick fed sophomore linemate Luke Esposito at the point and then collected Esposito’s rebound in the slot before beating Brown sophomore goaltender Tim Ernst glove-side.
It was Blackwell’s first goal since Jan. 9, 2013, when he scored the tying mark in a 6-5 Harvard comeback at Boston University. Blackwell missed all of the 2013-2014 season and all but three games of the 2014-2015 regular season with concussion-related symptoms.
“He’s gone through a lot of trials and tribulations,” Brown coach Brendan Whittet said. “I don’t feel happy that he scored two on us, but you’re always happy when a kid can overcome those scary concussion symptoms and issues.”
Blackwell’s second of the night was another high-skilled tally—a near side finish from the right circle that put the Crimson up, 5-1, with under 11 minutes left in regulation.
“It is a credit to him that without the amount of games that it would take somebody to stay sharp, he’s worked very hard to play at that kind of speed and with that kind of skill,” Donato said. “It’s a tribute not only to Colin but also to the training staff.”
With the emphatic return of one star, Harvard lost another. Sophomore Alex Kerfoot left the game late in the first period after colliding with a player in the Brown zone and would leave the arena in a right sling.
An upper body injury in the first game of last year's conference tournament forced the first-line center to miss postseason play last year. His status for the rest of this tournament is unclear.
“I guess we’ll probably check in the morning, but hopefully it’s not too bad,” Donato said.
Criscuolo opened the scoring at 3:57 on the power play, tapping in a cross-crease feed from Vesey at the left post.
Vesey connected on a one-timer in the left slot a period later off a behind-the-goal-line feed from classmate Brian Hart. Sophomore defenseman Clay Anderson set up Vesey’s second strike—a breakaway from the blue line—with a stretch pass at the Crimson goal line at 14:15 in the third period.
“He’s been remarkably consistent,” Donato said of Vesey, who was named the Ivy League’s Player of the Year on Thursday. “You expect great players to be important at this time of year, and he certainly was great tonight.”
Jake Horton scored early in the second period less than a minute after Vesey’s first goal to give Harvard a 4-0 lead. The sophomore forward redirected a behind-goal pass from sophomore center Sean Malone past the pads of Ernst, whom Whittet immediately pulled in favor of classmate Tyler Steel.
Fourth-year Crimson goaltender Steve Michalek (28 saves), meanwhile, looked confident in his first postseason win.
“He made some important saves and had some flurries of saves,” Donato said. “Not only did he make the saves, but he looked calm and collected back there, and I think that is something that is kind of felt throughout the team.”
First line forwards senior Matt Lorito and junior Nick Lappin had Brown’s only goals of the night. Lorito struck from the left point on the power play seconds after the expiration of a two-man advantage at 11:17 to draw the game to 4-1. Lappin added the game’s final marker with a close shot through traffic with just over three minutes left in regulation.
As time expired, the Bears looked ahead to Saturday. The game ended in a line-wide altercation with 1:19 left after Anderson boarded a Brown player on the right side of the Harvard zone, leading to penalties to three players. Whittet’s squad will need to find something extra this weekend in order to avoid an early end to its season.
“They’re a very gifted hockey team,” Whittet said of the Crimson. “We gave them some life, and they were really coming in waves on that forecheck. We were over-handling pucks, and I thought our [defensemen] got overwhelmed a little bit.”

UPDATED: March 6, 2015, at 11:23 p.m.
After watching Harvard celebrate an Ivy League championship on its own floor a year ago, the Yale men’s basketball team (22-8, 11-2 Ivy) returned the favor with a vengeance Friday night.
In the most highly anticipated basketball game at Lavietes Pavilion in years, the Bulldogs took control of the game early and led for the final 25:37 in a 62-52 victory over Harvard (20-7, 10-3) that took the Crimson’s Ivy League destiny out of its own hands. Despite not getting a single bucket from its top three-point shooter, junior Jack Montague, the Elis made 7-of-16 from beyond the arc and snagged nine offensive rebounds to overcome 14 turnovers.
“Their ability to get second-chance opportunities in the second half I thought was the difference,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Credit to Yale, terrific job by their kids, and [they were] very deserving of victory tonight.”
The two teams’ respective seniors shone brightest. Yale guard Javier Duren—who had 11 points in the game’s final 88 seconds, holding off a Crimson comeback by himself—led all scorers with 22 points on just 11 shots. He added nine rebounds and three assists, picking up the slack for his more heralded teammate, junior forward Justin Sears. The Ivy League Player of the Year candidate had two big threes but otherwise was held in check with more fouls (four) than field goals (three).
On the home side, Harvard co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi had 21 points and 10 rebounds. In a rare display of rage, the senior threw his hands in disgust after Harvard fell down by 10 early in the second half—proceeding thereafter to nearly make up the deficit by himself.
The Cameroon native made a jumper to cut the lead to eight a minute later, later hitting an and-one layup to cut the deficit to four with 11 minutes to go and bring the crowd to its feet. After the Bulldogs pushed the lead to eight with six minutes to go, he had a layup and an alley-oop dunk to bring Harvard within two possessions. Junior co-captain Siyani Chambers hit a pair of free throws a possession later to cut the lead to two points, but the Crimson got no closer.
“[Moundou-Missi] was one of the few people who was really battling,” senior wing Wesley Saunders said. “He was trying to spark us and get us energized, but we never really caught on. He played a great game…. He really carried us there.”
The game was eerily similar to the teams’ first meeting, with the visitor taking an early first-half lead. This time it was the Bulldogs, who responded with a 9-0 run when Harvard took the game’s first two-possession lead. The home team rallied, closing to within three points at the half behind eight points from Saunders.
But while Saunders was the star in the first half, he was invisible in the second. The Crimson’s leading scorer and reigning Ivy League Player of the Year did not have a point in the second half until 12 seconds remained with the game already out of reach. The team’s best perimeter defender spent time on Duren, Montague, and Yale senior forward Armani Cotton, serving as a Swiss Army Knife on the other end.
“We ask a lot of Wesley,” Amaker said. “We ask him to be our best player all over the floor, and that takes its toll. He’s capable; he’s done it before. He didn’t do it as well as we needed tonight, [however].”
With its best player struggling, Harvard’s role players failed to provide the spark. Sophomore sharpshooter Corbin Miller missed all nine of his shots, including a number of open looks that Amaker noted he would take from Miller every night. Classmate Zena Edosomwan missed all four of his shots, spending almost the entire game on the bench. Outside of its top three scorers, the Crimson got just 10 points from the remaining six players who saw playing time.
With a game left in the season, Harvard can still force a one-game playoff for the league title with a win Saturday against Brown and a Yale loss at Dartmouth.
“We knew the implications of this game,” Saunders said. “It’s a tough loss, but we have another one tomorrow, so we can’t hang our heads…. Brown isn’t going to come in here feeling sorry for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leading up to Friday night's conference-deciding Harvard-Yale tilt in Cambridge (8 p.m., ASN), the Ivy League Player of the Year race is still up in the air. Below, three Crimson sportswriters pitched their choice for ILPoY.
Justin Sears:
By Julian Ryan
To understand why Justin Sears is the best player in the Ivy League this year, you have to embrace the importance of the less glamorous side of the sport of basketball: defence and efficiency. Sears is a skilled and athletic wing who has absolutely been putting up buckets, but what ultimately separates him from the competition this season is combining that with a truly excellent defensive season and canny shooting season. Sears is the reason he’ll be leading his team into Lavietes this weekend with a chance to usurp the Crimson dynasty.
My fellow columnists may throw Hollinger’s Player Efficiency Rating, Myers’ version of Statistical Plus-Minus or Kubatko’s Win Shares out there as all-in-one ‘holy grail’ statistics which may argue why Sears is not the justified winner, but these metrics are flawed for this occasion. Firstly, at their core they are simple weightings of the box-score stats, the things we can count like points, assists and steals, and those weightings are based off NBA-based analyses. Although the formulas can be computed for college players, they do not necessarily reflect the college game, particularly when we get to the extremes as with these players. Secondly and more crucially, adjusting for strength of schedule is far more important in college, given there is significantly more variation in quality than the NBA. By kenpom.com, Columbia faced a considerably non-conference easier schedule than Harvard and Yale (who had the hardest of the three) and it is extremely difficult to appropriately adjust for that. So in my argument, I’m only going to rely on conference game data – even though admittedly Saunders has actually regressed a bit since his manic start to the season. The following statistics are all from college basketball reference from Ivy League play this season:
Wesley Saunders
Maodo Lo
Justin Sears
Points per Game
16.8
18.1
16.8
Rebounds per Game
6.8
4.3
8.1
Assists per Game
4.5
2.4
1.9
Steals per Game
1.5
1.2
1.2
Blocks per Game
0.3
0.2
2.4
Offensive Rating
112.7
114.9
121.5
Defensive Rating
91.6
106.4
89.9
Usage Rate
31.5
29.9
25.7
In these three numbers, Sears’ argument becomes clear. He has used significantly fewer possession than his teammates and according to this research, Saunders and Lo have actually been probably about as efficient as Sears this season after adjusting for their drop in efficiency from taking so many more shots for their team. However, that is clearly a conscious choice by Sears, who was scoring almost 20 points per Ivy game last season, but this year has curtailed that for an efficient attack. This is only logical when the also very efficient Javier Duren (ORtg 108.5 in Ivy play) is in the backcourt. Neither Lo nor Saunders can claim to have a teammate with the same level of offensive firepower of Duren this season (poor one out for Siyani Chambers). The per-game stats are up there to show you that all these guys contribute heavily to their team, with Saunders’ assists and Sears’ rebounds and blocks jumping out as impressive. The big three though are at the bottom. Offensive and Defensive Ratings were invented by Dean Oliver in ‘Basketball on Paper’ and, from a theoretical framework so crucially it can be applied to college hoops, devised a system by which the weights he placed on box-score stats changed depending on their interaction and on team characteristics in general. He discerned that the value of an assist to a high percentage shooting team was worth more than to a team that shot poorly, and so allowed his weights to vary accordingly. The numbers should be viewed as an estimate of how many points the player is responsible for producing (on offense) or allowing (on defense) per 100 possessions. Usage Rate is how often a team’s possession ends with a shot, trip to the line or turnover by that player when he is on the court.
Defensively though, Sears is by himself. To interpret defensive rating numbers, one must appreciate that team defence plays a large role in the calculation, as defensive statistics make up a small part of the box-score. While Saunders has played on a ferocious Harvard defence, with multiple plus-defenders on the court at any one time and ranked top 25 in the nation by kenpom.com, Yale’s defence has been good but hardly great. When taking this into account, Sears’ defensive rating is substantially better than Saunders’, even though they look similar in a vacuum.
Lo’s inability to bring it on defence sees him out of the competition. Saunders is undeniably impressive in shouldering such a heavy load for his squad. But in combining efficient shooting with absolutely elite defence, Justin Sears is the only logical winner of Ivy League Player of the Year.
Wesley Saunders:
By David Freed
Entering Saturday night’s titanic contest between Harvard and Yale, the race for Ivy League Player of the Year looks to be a three-way contest between senior wing Wesley Saunders, Yale junior forward Justin Sears, and Columbia junior Maodo Lo. My fellow columnists have argued in favor of Sears and Lo, but combining tactical and statistical analysis, it is obvious Saunders is the champion.
Lo has the weakest candidacy of the three. The strongest argument is that he’s the most effective (and proficient) scorer in the Ivy League, recently dropping 35 points on Brown and 33 on Harvard, shooting a combined 66 percent in those two games. On the less glamorous parts of the games, Lo struggles. His defensive rating of 106.4 in Ivy League play is by far the worst of the candidates and he has been a ball-stopped by point guard standards, averaging just 2.4 assists a game in Ivy League play
Looking at Sears and Saunders, it’s a question of value. Both teams structure their schemes around their star’s unique talents—Yale’s defense is based on funneling all ball-handlers to Sears inside; Harvard relies on Saunders to check the opponent’s best perimeter player and he’s spent time on point guards and power forwards alike at various parts of the year.
The statistics are kinder to Sears, who boasts a lead in Win Shares (2.6 to 2.2), defensive rating (90.1 to 91.6), and true shooting percentage (60.4 percent to 52.9 percent). The largest reason for the differences is shooting efficiency. Given that Harvard’s late-clock strategy is a typical variant of “give the ball to Wes and pray,” a bulk of Saunders’ shot selection is contested jumpers in the lane everyone on the defense is waiting for.
The lack of offensive weaponry around him is evident in the decline in his true shooting and effective field goal percentage. Sophomore year, when coach Tommy Amaker spaced the floor around him with three shooters, Saunders had significantly more room to operate and got to the free throw line much more—shooting a higher percentage at the rim. Sears has many of these same advantages, routinely playing with two or more ace three-point shooters behind him. Harvard, by contrast, often looks like it is playing four-on-five on offense, with defenders hardly guarding junior Agunwa Okolie to key in on Saunders.
Given this, we can look elsewhere to properly evaluate the two men’s games. Looking at the numbers, the first thing that jumps out is that both players boast roughly the same total rebounding percentage—indicating that from the wing, Saunders is giving his team forward-level rebounding. On a playmaking level, there is similarly no comparison—Saunders’ assist percentage (35.5 percent) is nearly three times Sears’ (13.9) while managing a lower turnover percentage. He has been responsible—through score or assist—for nearly 40 percent of the Crimson’s offense this season, something Sears cannot boast.
On the offensive end, then, the ancillary statistics give a better job of demonstrating Saunders’ importance to the Crimson offense. While Sears is a more efficient player, he is asked to do significantly less and is viewed more favorably by standard statistics that tend to disproportionately favor low-usage power forwards One needs to look no farther than ESPN’s own PER rankings—which share a lot of similarities to the Win Shares ones—to see names like Brandan Wright, Rudy Gobert, and Alexis Ajinca among the league’s top 25. Given this bias, Saunders’ numbers look all the more impressive. In this context, his high usage rate is a boon, not a mark against him.
The last relevant area is look at is the player’s performance in important games, essentially leveraging his stats for the situation. Here, Saunders comes out significantly ahead. In Yale’s two conference losses—and its near-loss Saturday at home against Penn—Sears has been practically invisible on the court, averaging just 8.3 points and taking only about seven shots a game. He had six turnovers in a must-win last Saturday against Penn where Yale trailed for nearly 35 minutes before making a late run.
Saunders, by contrast, has been at his best when the team needs him most. He had 33 points and 10 rebounds against Brown, carrying a static team and tipping in his own miss as time expired for the win. The next night at Yale, he led all scorers with 16 points and added five rebounds and three assists while holding the Elis’ best perimeter play—senior Javier Duren—to three-for-11 shooting. Against Columbia a week later, he was responsible for 18 points, six assists, and five rebounds in a four-point win. Last weekend, after being the only player to show up (19 points, 11 rebounds, no turnovers) offensively in a 57-49 loss to Cornell, he had 21 points (on just eight shots) and five assists as Harvard comfortably dispatched Columbia.
Ultimately, with the two still having their biggest game to play, the award is still up in the air. Using what I assume was the logic of last year’s committee, I’m guessing it will go to the best player on the best team—meaning that a win Friday night could have double the implications for the winning team’s star. Through 12 games, however, Saunders has established himself as clearly the front-runner.
Maodo Lo:
By Kurt Bullard
“What these young bloods have to understand is that this game, has always been, and will always be about buckets.”
So says the all-time NBA great Bill Russell. And if you’re using the 11-time NBA champion’s criterion, Maodo Lo is the obvious choice to take home the title of Ivy League Player of the Year.
Maodo Lo has been putting up points at a higher clip than any other player in the Ivy League this year, averaging 18.1 points per game in league play. Lo is forced to shoulder more of an offensive load than Saunders or Sears, taking 13 shots per game—one more than Saunders and three more than Sears.
His defining performance of the year came last Saturday against Harvard. Lo dropped 33 points against the 24th-ranked defense in the country, effortlessly going 13-for-21 on the night. The rest of his team struggled on the night, only combing to go 13-for-28 from the field.
Not only is he getting buckets more often than anyone else in the conference, but he’s also been scoring efficiently. Lo boasts the highest effective field goal rate in the conference with a 58% clip heading into the last season, higher than both Wesley Saunders and Justin Sears.
Saunders dropped 33 in an overtime game against Brown, but only shot 41 percent from the field when doing so against the 218th-ranked Brown defense. Lo one-upped Saunders later in the season, dropping 35 of his own against Brown while shooting 70 percent from the field. Lo is not only scoring more points, but he’s doing so more while not taking away as many shots from his teammates as Saunders.
Sure, some will point to the lack of wins that the Lions have at this late stage of the season as a reason why Lo doesn’t deserve the award, but there’s only so much that one player can do for his team. The Lions suffered a huge blow when Alex Rosenberg decided to withdraw from Columbia to preserve his final year of eligibility after injuring his foot. He had been named first-team All-Ivy a year before, averaging 16 points per game. The fact that Lo has been able to score efficiently despite being the team’s obvious go-to player is impressive in itself.
Some will also point to Lo’s relatively high defensive rating on the season as reason why he isn’t the best player in the conference. But his 106.4 defensive rating in conference play (compared to Saunders’ 91.6 and Sears’ 89.9) is inflated by the fact that his overall team struggles defensively. Columbia ranks 255th in the conference – second to last in the Ivy League. Both Yale and Harvard play significantly better defense by this metric, so it’s tough to compare individual defensive metrics between the players.
Dion Waiters said it best after a 24-point performance earlier this year, tweeting that “Men lie. Women lie. Buckets [don’t].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the final Friday of conference play in the 2013-2014 season, then-junior Wesley Saunders found sharpshooter Laurent Rivard behind the arc in the left corner. Rivard didn’t hesitate before letting the shot fly over his Yale defender, giving his team a double-digit advantage and effectively sealing its bid to the NCAA Tournament.
On the final Friday of this year’s campaign, the hundreds of students donned in Crimson gear held their collective breath as their men’s basketball team tried to cross the t's and dot the i’s of a comeback against the Bulldogs with a similar series of shots from the three-point line.
But unlike one year ago, there was no catch-and-shoot from the left corner, no Rivard triple, and no Harvard celebration. This time, each attempted three ricocheted off the rim, placing the ball, physically and proverbially, in the hands of Yale (22-8, 11-2 Ivy). Fittingly, it was a missed trey that ended the game for the Crimson (20-7, 10-3), with the Elis finally on the redemptive side of rivalry weekend, marching out of Lavietes Pavilion with the 62-52 win on Friday evening.
“[It was a] tough night for us shooting the basketball,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we had a ton of shots [and] we just didn’t make them. I don’t know what else to say.”
While the Crimson misfired on all eight of its three-point attempts in the first half, it was the wide-open missed triples down the stretch that closed the door on any chance of a comeback that Harvard had.
After falling behind by 10, 33-23, in the opening minutes of the second period, the Crimson took advantage of a Bulldog cold shooting spell to go on a tear. Thanks to a triple from junior co-captain Siyani Chambers, a short corner jumper from senior forward Jonah Travis, and an and-one from co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi, Harvard climbed back within four points, 35-31, with just over 10 minutes to play.
With the crowd the loudest it had been all night and the signal from Amaker to press, the Harvard defense forced Yale freshman Makai Mason into an errant reverse-layup, sending the Crimson running in transition. Only moments later, Saunders caught a cross-court pass from Chambers, squared up, and let the ball go. The shot that would’ve brought the Crimson within one point for the first time since the opening half clanged off the rim, resulting in a buried Bulldog three on Yale’s ensuing possession.
With 4:48 to play, an almost identical sequence played out. Down four and in possession of the ball, Chambers swung the rock to the left wing where sophomore sharpshooter Corbin Miller lay waiting. But as was the case all night, Miller misfired. Just one minute later, Miller missed once more.
Harvard’s 11.8 percent from deep was the worst three-point shooting performance the team has seen since 2013, while Friday's contest was the only time all season that Miller didn’t connect on a single field goal, ending the night 0-of-9 from the field—eight of which came from beyond the arc.
“It was an off night,” Saunders said. “We just let our emotions get too high.”
So while Rivard’s three in 2014 punched Harvard’s ticket to March Madness, it was Yale, this season, that celebrated after the final triple of the night, clinching a share of the Ivy title in front of a silenced, sold-out Lavietes crowd.
MON-DON’T-MISSI
Typically described by teammates as “poised,” the ever-composed Steve Moundou-Missi was furious as he walked towards his squad’s huddle with 16:50 to play on Friday night. He yelled something towards the bench, slapping a towel against the hardwood in a rare display of emotion. The Crimson was down 10, and the fate of his last few days of collegiate basketball was hanging in the balance.
And after the timeout ended and he took the court once more, Moundou-Missi seemed to further push aside that ever-calm demeanor, doing the dirty work—whatever it took—on both ends of the floor to give his team a fighting chance at a comeback.
Less than a minute after the timeout, a Miller missed shot led to an Eli fast break. Moundou-Missi ran the floor alongside Yale’s guards, swatting away senior Armani Cotton’s layup attempt before pivoting and sprinting down the court the other way; and fittingly, when Saunders found Moundou-Missi 17 feet from the basket in the right corner on the next possession, the forward showed no hesitation putting up the jump shot—burying it and beginning the Harvard’s run.
“He left it all out there on the court,” Saunders said. “[He] was battling, fighting.”
When Saunders sent an entry pass to Moundou-Missi with just over 11 minutes to play, the co-captain got his defender in the air, bullied his way into the paint, drew contact, and finished the layup. Three-point play, four-point game.
Then it was a hook shot over the extended right arm of Yale standout Justin Sears. Then it was a fast break alley-oop dunk from Chambers, who rewarded the big man for sprinting in transition, throwing the ball towards the hoop as Moundou-Missi soared in from the right wing.
The Lavietes crowd roared as the Yale bench signaled for a timeout—and when Moundou-Missi jogged to his team’s huddle once more, a semblance of his typical poise was back.
The co-captain would score six of his team’s final 13 points, finishing the game with a team-high 21 points on 9-of-18 shooting from the floor—his best offensive performance this season.
“He laid it all on the line,” Amaker said. “[H]e put his heart and soul out there, not wanting to feel like he had any regrets, and that was really wonderful to see….  [His] effort, energy, determination—how he played tonight was outstanding. We just didn’t have enough help.”
DUREN DURESS
Following the Crimson’s 52-50 win over Yale in New Haven last month, senior guard Javier Duren sat slumped in his seat, speaking to the media in the low, hushed tones reserved for those moments in sports when a game is lost, a big shot missed, a dream dashed.
“[I’d] take a win, especially over Harvard, over anything I could accomplish personally,” he said.
One month later, the personal accomplishments and program wins that he spoke of went hand-in-hand, as Duren led his team from tip-off to final buzzer on Friday evening, filling up the stat sheet in his last go-around against his hated Harvard squad.
His consecutive jumpers in the game’s opening minutes gave Yale its early advantage and his lights-out shooting in the contest’s waning moments sealed the Eli victory. Duren tallied 11 of his team’s 15 points in the last 1:28 of play, shooting a perfect 8-of-8 from the stripe in that span en route to his game-high 22 points.
Duren’s performance was the distorted mirror image of Harvard’s, as he responded, over and over again, to the Crimson’s runs by hitting big shots. When Harvard cut it to two, 43-41, with 3:40 remaining, Duren answered by attacking the elbow and crossing over twice, before stepping back and burying the jumper. Soon after, when Moundou-Missi brought Harvard within four with less than two minutes to play, Duren drilled a three from the left wing, knocking it down over the smaller Chambers.
“Duren was outstanding tonight,” Amaker said. “I [think] his poise, toughness, and confidence can be very contagious for their club, and I thought he was the best player on the floor…. We knew coming in how good and how tough he is.”
On a night when both teams were vying for a share of the Ancient Eight title, Duren pulled the crown the Elis’ way—finally getting that win he wished for one month ago.

If you’ve received the invite to the mysterious Facebook event, #HarvardOasis, asking if you “Remember warm?” then your reaction was probably the same as ours. *No*. No, we don’t remember warm, because New England has very literally frozen our hearts and souls. But we’d like to, and the event promises that summer is coming...at least from 3-6 p.m. this Sunday in the Science Center.
Danny V. Banks ‘17, Student Initiatives Chair on the Undergraduate Council, Holly Breuer ‘18 and Dakota Santana-Grace '16 both from the College Events Board helped plan and organize the event with the UC, CEB, the Office Dean of Student Life, the Dean of the College, and SMHL. The aim of the event, aided by a large anonymous donation, is to increase student happiness on campus (and Flyby, for one, is ecstatic that Harvard cares about our happiness to give us something other than reading and psets to do on Sundays).
As far as what to expect on Sunday, the planners are keeping the details of the event relatively quiet, but Banks did reveal that, “the Science Center will be unrecognizable. An outside group is doing the decorations. It’s going to be really decorated.” Those decorations will extend into the lecture halls, one of which “will have a formative movie from our childhood that has to do with the beach and the ocean.” (Hm...anyone have any guesses???).
Flyby has also confirmed that there will be tiki bars (yes, plural), a game room with shuffleboard, ping pong, and cornhole, and a surprise entertainment center in the basement of the Science Center. Flyby has our collective fingers crossed for a moon bounce, but that might not be feasible indoors but we can still dream so whatever.
So take advantage of all 42 degrees that Sunday has to offer and leave your dorm without looking like a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, and take a stroll to the Science Center where you can pretend that it’s 82 degrees. After all, spring break is fast approaching and this pset probably isn’t going to help your grade all that much, so prep for vacation with #HarvardOasis.

Recently, a fake Harvard rejection letter has circulated the internet, making light of the heightened anxiety surrounding college admissions around this time of year. The letter has been shared over 700 times on Facebook and Reddit, with many believing its contents to be authentic. But creator Molly McGaan’s set of talents, including “dank meme” proficiency and high levels of “$wagg moneyyyy” aren’t far from the realistic skill set of many Harvard students. The admissions office may be ostensibly looking for a set of qualities that define the next generation of talent, but from what we’ve seen of the student population during Primal Scream or even this past week’s first wave of midterms, they let in a wider range than just high SAT scores and well-written essays. What does it actually take to be a Harvard student? We think Molly McGaan has some real potential, and here’s why:
“We didn’t need a copy of your mixtape, regardless of how ‘fire’ it is.”
If the life of the average Harvard student were to be documented in a mixtape, what would it sound like? A moaning beached whale? Hysterical laughter after a midterm (regardless of the result)? Molly, your animal sounds may not be too far from reality, especially when we consider the fact that it’s nearly Spring Break, there’s still snow on the ground, and the Charles River has yet to un-freeze. What do we sound like when we realize we have three exams in a week? Yay?!
“We also suggest obtaining recommendation letters from teachers or trusted mentors, not my '#4 side ho Derek.'”
Picture this: it’s your freshman spring, and you’re just starting to look for summer internship opportunities because you’ve realized that Harvard freshmen by and large “accomplish things” and you need to, too. You also realize that your teachers, by and large professors who lead 400-student-plus lectures, probably don’t know who you are. Which makes sense, because you watched most of the lectures online. Sometimes, Chief Keef or your “side ho” may be the best ones to recommend you– yep, makes sense.
“We will be returning your copy of Grownups 2 signed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, because you said it was your ‘greatest possession’ and we don’t want it.”
Honestly, a signature of Angela Merkel would be a pretty big deal. Sure, presidents and the Humans of New York guy come here from time to time, but unless you’re the lucky duck who won the Institute of Politics’ elusive lottery, the closest you’re gonna get is a blurry Snapchat photo of the back of Amy Poehler’s head. Keep your head up, Molly, you sound like you’d fit right in!

The vast majority of the time, our classmates are impressive individuals who truly have accomplished most of what is written on their resumes and make us feel worse about the current state of our own lives. Sometimes, however, they like to stretch the truth….
“I had Bean boots before they were a thing.”Alright, so here’s the thing about Bean boots and your claim to fame in owning them before the rest of us– they’ve existed for nearly a hundred years, and chances are, unless your Bean boots are legitimately your grandparents’ and you legitimately live in Maine, you didn’t beat the trend that made news for its growing popularity more than three years ago. We know, we know, you’re from the Northeast! You’re no California kid trying to make do in his first winter! It’s okay– we won’t tell how recent your “rugged look” actually is.
 “Grade inflation definitely exists here, but not in any of my classes.”Ah yes, the classic “I am suffering more than you” comment, akin to the “I didn’t start my pset until 3 o’clock last night because I had an essay due at midnight” or the “I haven’t slept for more than 4 hours in 3 days” comment. Maybe it’s something about being a Harvard student, but we love our comparisons and our complaints. An A- is just not the same as an A, duh!
“Yeah, I participate in the hookup culture here.”Okay.
“I’ve always had a genuine interest in finance.”For some people, this could be true– they receive equal amounts of joy reading the latest from the Financial Times or the Economist as they do in finishing the third season of “House of Cards.” Excel spreadsheets get their hearts racing far faster than any relationship ever could, and their feelings are best expressed in a set of Powerpoint slides. Why investment banking? It’s funny you should ask, because it all started at the age of three when I pulled my first all-nighter...
“FOMO doesn’t really affect me, you know?”Oh, really? You’ve never gone to a party because your friends (or the girl of your dreams RSVP’d to the Facebook invite) are going? What do you even use Facebook/Instagram/Twitter for anyways? To stay updated on your side bar’s world news (sidenote: very helpful for pretending to be cultured and worldly)? We’re happy for you, we really are, but they also say the Friday night “freshman wander” can be a lot of fun! After all, what could be more fulfilling than getting rejected from yet another final club?!

Unless you've been living under a rock, in Lamont, or binge-watching the new House of Cards season, you know about Felipe’s new home on Brattle Street. After a brief stay with Flat Patties, this historic establishment now has its very own place again. After talking to the manager and delving deeply into their proudly authentic Mexican cuisine (helping the Sophomore 15, yes freshmen, that's a thing too), Flyby has compiled the following reasons you'll love the Nuevo Felipe’s:
Let’s be real, Felipe’s is the place where all Harvard students go (and where I wish the University would let me use my Board Plus). Be it for a study break or late night case of the munchies, Felipe’s will always welcome the hungry student into its new home.

Freshman, beware! One of the most important days of your freshman lives is coming up– Housing Day. Even though some of you will get lucky in terms of distance to the Yard, know that the tense minutes before your housing assignment arrives will be more agonizing than having to eat swai every week in the Berg. We’ve got some ways for you to anticipate that knock on the door and distract yourselves from your final fate.
1. Watch every Housing Day video in existence multiple times. Work on the pset you told yourself you were going to start last night. Do anything to block out the sounds of upperclassmen storming the Yard.
2. Have a box of Kleenex on every flat surface of the room. Will you and your blockmates cry tears of joy or tears of utter despair? You’ll never know, so it's better to be prepared rather than crying into the chest of the person handing you your housing letter.
3. Now it is time to get down to what really matters— food. Regardless of whether or not you get into your dream house or the one of your nightmares, you and your blockmates want to be able to celebrate or drown your sorrows in food. So go ahead, get hundreds of munchkins from Dunkin Donuts, tons of coffee from Au Bon Pain, all the chips at CVS. Freshman fifteen in one go?
4. Group hug all your blockmates and create a last minute prayer circle to the Housing Gods.
5. Prepare your reactions ahead of time for when you think you hear the chants of a house coming close to your door. Just don’t be the person who cries or slams the door on the upperclassmen who arrive.
Regardless of which House you’re stuck with, it’s only three years. And you can always transfer out (though the chances you get through are slim). Like we all say on Housing Day, may the odds be ever in your favor.
