After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The city of Oakland is as essential to Bay Area rapper Mani Draper’s existence as water is to fish.
“There's something magical about the Bay,” Draper said in an interview with The Harvard Crimson. “In the Bay, you can be an entrepreneur, you can be a creative, you can be an owner. There's all these opportunities and people come here to explore that part of themselves.”
For Draper, Oakland is his home and his creative lifeblood, a city with deep musical roots that are often overlooked. After all, Oakland is the town that birthed the world’s first bona fide rap star, MC Hammer.
“We have an opportunity to rewrite how our legacy in the Bay is remembered,” Draper said. “With MC Hammer, there’s a disservice done to his legacy for being the first rap star. Like it’s not Run DMC. It’s not Snoop Dogg. It's not people from other regions. The first rap superstar is MC Hammer, who went Diamond for fuck’s sake. He’s from East Oakland.”
As an artist, Draper said that he is a product of those who came before him. He is as much a rapper as he is a producer. Oakland’s rich artistic history pre-dates the invention of hip-hop. The likes of Richard Pryor and James Brown would regularly make stops in the city as an opportunity to crowd-test their acts for improvement.
Draper is a founding member of Grand Nationxl, an Oakland hip-hop collective created in 2020. Akin to the Wu-Tang Clan or Danny Brown’s Bruiser Brigade, Grand Nationxl is a rap crew focused on delivering high-quality bars on posse and solo projects alike. Founding member Kevin Allen dropped his acclaimed solo album “Nothing Lasts Forever” under the Grand Nationxl banner last October. The Oakland crew has also integrated a creative agency into the Grand Nationxl brand that is designed to identify and uplift local talent from the Bay Area and beyond through teamwork and collaboration — think Griselda Records meets Kendrick Lamar’s pgLang.
Draper’s latest solo effort “Communion,” which was released on March 11, is indicative of Grand Nationxl’s collective mindset. The album title and inspiration for the project came from Draper’s examination of communion as a creative concept.
“I am exceeding all of my dreams as a creative, just being a part of something bigger,” the rapper said. “And so then one starts thinking about Death Row, Dreamville, Odd Future, TDE. You realize you can benefit from being a part of a system. If you're the sixth man or the eighth man on the Jordan Chicago Bulls, you're still part of one of the best teams in history.”
“Communion” is as much a Mani Draper album as it is a Grand Nationxl one, according to the rapper. With six songs in length, the project boasts features from Allen and fellow Grand Nationxl members Brookfield Duece and Passwurdz.
The album is fully produced by Allen, who has been a close collaborator of Draper’s for the last several years. The fourth track on the project, “Favor Weighs a Ton” sees Draper and Allen go bar-for-bar, a sonic follow-up to the pair’s “Glass House” collaboration on “Nothing Lasts Forever.” Draper was an executive producer on “Nothing Lasts Forever.”
Draper’s latest effort hears the rapper commenting on the rapidly changing world around him: modernities like Oakland, church service, the hip-hop landscape, NFTs, and the Metaverse. “A.T.’s Gospel,” which features Duece and Passwurdz, is Draper’s tribute to the late Memphis legend Adolph Thornton, whose stage name was Young Dolph. “W.L. NFT (D.O.C.’s Gospel),” the final track on “Communion,” is the rapper’s homage to early N.W.A.-affiliate The D.O.C. — an ode to his father’s favorite ’90s rapper, according to Draper.
Yet, this was not the album Draper intended to put out. The version of “Communion” released to the public last month was recorded in just three days, a stark contrast to the meticulously crafted approach that Draper took in his executive producing role for “Nothing Lasts Forever.” The reason for the switch was out of Draper’s hands and is tied to the recent rise in car-jackings throughout the Bay Area. “Bipping” is the colloquial term locals have assigned to motor vehicle theft. In December 2021, Draper’s car was bipped, along with all his laptops and drives, which in many cases held one-of-one copies of his intellectual property.
“In December, Grand Nationxl was on our way to one of the biggest meetings of the company's existence,” Draper said. “Part of the meeting was set up for me to do a demo of the music that was made for Kev’s album. As we're having coffee before the meeting, we hear someone break the glass in my car.”
Immediately, Draper and the rest of Grand Nationxl ran outside. A high-speed chase through East Oakland ensued. It was ultimately futile. The work that Draper had planned to incorporate into “Communion” was gone. The thieves had also taken music that Draper had written for other artists including Duece as well as longtime collaborators Rexx Life Raj, P-Lo, and Iamsu!.
“I got records for people on my hard drives that they're waiting to get mixed and mastered and all the shit that they're trusting me to get done,” Draper said. “I was just sick because they were gone.”
Draper credits Allen with lifting him out of a slump after the car-jacking. To create “Communion,” Draper and Allen abandoned the luxury Oakland studio used to produce previous Grand Nationxl projects for a back-to-basics approach, sometimes recording until six or seven in the morning.
“Kev pulled up to my girl's house in Richmond,” Draper said. “We recorded all of ‘Communion’ at my girl’s mother's hair salon that's attached to their house. We set up shop there for a week and ‘Communion’ was recorded in three days.”
The car theft was demoralizing for Draper, but he said that the incident gave him the opportunity to reflect upon and reconnect with his creative roots. Giving up was never an option.
“There’s a time to mourn and be sad, but there was also some strange celebration in the moment,” the rapper said. “I wanted to make sure to capture a little bit of both.”
“Communion” speaks to Draper’s limitless passion for the music he makes. It is another piece of hardware in the ever-expanding Grand Nationxl trophy case. It can be streamed here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Harvard College,
I am writing to let you know that I am resigning as student body president, effective immediately. I was elected on the signature promise of dissolving and replacing the Undergraduate Council. Since that’s been fulfilled, I must step aside so we can turn to our next chapter.
Many generations of Harvard undergraduates before us have debated changing or ending the Undergraduate Council. Forty years after the Undergraduate Council’s establishment, this generation found the political will to take a decisive step. Nearly 4,000 undergraduates voted in the referendum (57.2 percent voter turnout) — the highest number of votes cast in any Undergraduate Council election since 2004. You chose to establish a new, action-oriented student association that aims to better serve all of us and generations of students to come. I am excited to see you participate in the initial elections and bring your aspirations for our University to this new system.
The last few months have taught us a lot. They have shown that we are capable of coming together, listening respectfully to others’ points of view, and turning our principles and ideals into reality. Leadership requires imagination, a willingness to question systems and think beyond established boxes. Those interested in the state of the public sphere should enter leadership roles, do what they promised to the best of their ability, and know when to leave.
It’s time to focus on the future that you voted for. The transition to that future must be as seamless as possible.
As per the new constitution, Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 will immediately assume the role of President and serve until new elections have been held in several weeks. Emmett will be your final UC President, and he has selected Christopher T. Cantwell ’22-’23 to serve as Vice President because of his independence and integrity. Chris is a Computer Science and Government concentrator in Leverett House who has served as a mediator on the UC this past semester, helped write the new constitution, and has years of nonpartisan civic experience from work with the Harvard Votes Challenge.
Emmett and Chris will not run for elected positions in the HUA. Their top priority is a smooth, successful transition, with elections staying as civil and policy-focused as possible.
I would like to thank you again for the honor and privilege of serving as your president. I’m grateful that we were able to launch Research Snackchats to connect students with experienced researchers and mentors, improve the Harvard administration’s transparency on Covid-19 policies, pilot new approaches to digital democracy, work with Harvard University Dining Services to offer new options and improve food quality, and help establish Double Concentrations to provide more academic flexibility.
As of this morning, every Harvard undergraduate has received a $10 Crimson Cash refund from the UC’s financial dissolution. I hope that this small gesture (toward printing, laundry, or food) begins to restore confidence in what student governance at Harvard is capable of.
In my last weeks at Harvard, I look forward to getting lost in used bookstores, playing video games like Tales of Symphonia and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, and spending time with friends and teammates. I am excited for my spring season with HVL (the varsity men’s lightweight rowing team), the first place at Harvard where I could be accepted for who I am, with all my imperfections.
To everyone who believes in a better Harvard — thank you so much for being part of this journey. I wish you the best for the rest of your time at Harvard and beyond.
I leave you with a quote from “The True Harvard,” a 1903 speech by Harvard philosopher William James:
“As a nursery for independent and lonely thinkers I do believe that Harvard still is in the van. Here they find the climate so propitious that they can be happy in their very solitude. The day when Harvard shall stamp a single hard and fast type of character upon her children, will be that of her downfall. Our undisciplinables are our proudest product. Let us agree together in hoping that the output of them will never cease.”
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a History and Mathematics concentrator in Quincy House, was president of the Undergraduate Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School just announced that former Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch ’81 will be our Class Day speaker at graduation. The choice is disappointing, but appropriate.
I remember the moment I was certain that I needed to go to law school. A week after the 2016 presidential election, despite a heartbreaking loss, Hillary Clinton kept her commitment to speak at the annual gala for the Children’s Defense Fund. Having worked on the campaign and still reeling in disbelief myself, I could not imagine her strength and sense of service to show up that day. In her speech, she remembered her time as a young law student: “I had lots of hopes and expectations about what a law degree would enable me to do.” She spoke of her friend, Children’s Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman, and her early work as a legal activist on behalf of kids. It was a moment of deep inspiration. Three years ago, I, too, entered law school with an idealism about the power of a law degree.
But it doesn’t take much time in law school to pull back the curtain. The mythology of America emphasizes great reverence for our legal system, but the law is not always just, fair, or even logical. The law is about systemic, foundational power: who gets to make the rules — and who gets to break them. I’m pleased that the country has become more attuned to this reality as we reckon with police racism, a recent insurrection, and a Supreme Court legitimacy crisis. As I prepare to graduate this May, as one of my favorite TV lawyers, Ellen Parsons, dramatically quips, “I don’t believe in the law anymore, but I do believe in justice.”
Still, I’m thankful I went to law school. The law can be a powerful tool — a main lever for change on the path towards justice. More immediately, I’ve gained critical insight into corporate law firms and how they operate. These “Big Law” firms are the glue holding our systems of power together, for better or worse. Based on my exposure to such firms over the course of my law school education, fairly often, it’s for the worse. Much of the litigation work done at major law firms is aimed at protecting the Goliaths from the Davids or shielding corporate bad actors from public accountability.
While many of my peers have lofty public service ambitions, most will begin their careers within the Big Law ecosystem. This is in no small part due to what Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein might call a “nudge” from the HLS administration and legal industry more broadly. Career services for non-private firm opportunities are substantially less robust. Moreover, private firms have extensive resources to spend on recruiting students through a highly structured Early Interview Program process, while public interest and non-profit employers have less access.
Of course, there are also financial trade-offs. Top law firms offer first-year associates a starting salary of over $200,000. There are a number of public and non-profit legal jobs that offer middle-income salaries or better, but for many, it would require great privilege to be able to turn down a chance at quickly repaying student loans. Still, there is a reason then-Presidential candidate and Harvard alumnus Pete Buttigieg’s time at McKinsey & Company earned great scrutiny. Individual financial rationalizations aside, there is a fundamental tension between a lifelong commitment to public service and a stint making a killing for the prototypical corporate villains — against regular folks.
This is how the 83rd Attorney General of the United States Loretta Lynch has spent her post-Obama Administration career. As a partner at a leading Big Law firm, Lynch has taken on a jarring role. With the history-making weight of her honorable service as the first Black woman Attorney General on her shoulders, Lynch has chosen to defend McDonald’s and the NFL against allegations of anti-Black discrimination. Though not uncommon for public sector leaders to return to private practice — her predecessor Eric H. Holder Jr. also returned to Big Law, in addition to championing voting rights efforts — I’ll admit her current trajectory in this charged moment is rather uninspiring.
As a private citizen, Lynch has every right to make whatever career choices are best for her. However — given her recent career arc — as Harvard Law School’s graduation speaker, Lynch symbolizes the haunting emptiness that plagues much of the legal profession.

On April 19, 2016, Nikki Daurio was walked to Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services by a set of her closest friends on Harvard’s campus. Nikki had been brawling with the convergence of depressive symptoms, intensifying body pains, and pounding headaches since January – by April, amidst this insurmountable storm, she had carved out a note and a plan.
But Nikki’s friends didn’t know either of these two particular facts prior to that late April walk to CAMHS. Only when they watched her falter and retreat at the sight of a few passing dogs did they realize something was off. “They know I love dogs,” Nikki told me. “And didn’t stop to pet any of them.”
It’s noticing these subtle signs, Nikki explained, that turns a good friend into an advocate. And it was one of these friends — not CAMHS — who later connected Nikki, daunted by the idea of admitting herself to a hospitalized setting, with a former roommate who had gone to McLean Hospital the year before. It was this call that granted Nikki the courage she needed to check into McLean the very next day.
After voluntarily admitting herself into McLean on April 20, 2016, Nikki spent eight days in the hospital before returning to campus to finish out the semester. The following fall, she opted to take a leave of absence.
Fast forward to 2017, and the role of Nikki’s friends-turned-advocates had been completely reconfigured through Harvard University print: “Past issues regarding undue stress on your friends, roommates, and teammates have raised some concerns about your enrollment at the College,” a contract presented to her read. She etched her signature onto the contract, entwined with “terms and conditions” that would allow for her subsequent return to campus.
This misconstrual of Nikki’s experience — in this not-so-fine-print which casts her help-seeking behaviors as a burden to her friends — isn’t just misleading. It’s also dangerous, particularly given the well-established importance of talking about suicide in order to prevent it. And it wasn’t just a slip of words, but a contract for the archives; one which should presumably have been met with care and rigor and review.
The actual Harvard College Administrative Board contingencies – while fundamentally designed to promote students’ future wellbeing and safety – also take on a subtly punitive tenor. One section indicates that should Nikki miss a therapy visit, or otherwise “fail to comply” with treatment directives,  her continued enrollment at the College could be jeopardized. Another condition allows the University, once approved by her provider, to monitor this compliance more directly, preemptively requiring that Nikki “agree to sign any additional authorization forms” that would enable designated University officials and clinicians to jointly monitor whether she was “cooperating.” These terms themselves are straightforward enough; and would clearly, in ideal circumstances, be leveraged by administrators to serve only their stated ends: That is, to see Nikki, or any signer, remain safe and “succeed at Harvard.”
But “terms and conditions” themselves cannot be wholly understood in isolation from the environment that they operate within. At Harvard, individual contracts like these, as well as universal policy terms, have instead become littered with evasive liability tacts – in which written guidelines have become twisted and lost in translation amid exchanges between University officials and students.
One student, who spoke with me under the condition of anonymity, claimed to have been signed onto a contract similar to Nikki’s after their Resident Dean learned of their eating disorder. The contract’s conditions, according to the student, included complying with a series of weekly weigh-ins at HUHS. When they eventually “dropped too much weight” and started struggling to meet treatment standards, the student alleges that they were made to leave the University within days.
“It wasn't even something I could resist,” the student told me. “I said what if I don't want to take a leave? They said, ‘no, you do not have a choice. You have to take this leave.’” The medical rationale, too, was lacking, based on the evaluations of the student's treatment team who, according to a note from the student’s parent that was sent to their Resident Dean at the time, understood the requirement to take a leave so “abruptly” to be “premature.”
“For a school to ask for students to take a leave means that there's a very serious manifestation,” said Michael A. Olivas, a higher education law expert and William B. Bates Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of Houston. “A concern that either can't be resolved during school, or that school itself is providing such a stressor, that it will not help you resolve.”
This pointedly perceptive intuition is, at a technical level, backed by Harvard policy — which designates mandatory leaves when the “student’s behavior poses a direct threat to the health or safety of any person.” But students’ quiet, hidden lived experiences paint a more difficult reality – one which reflects the all-too-readily interchangeable conflation between a student being a danger to themselves, and a danger to the University.
When the anonymous student petitioned to finish their in-person exams before returning home, they claim they were met with an approval and a caveat — they could take their tests, but they couldn’t live on, or enter, Harvard’s campus in the interim. And so, purportedly too unwell to remain a part of residential life, the student was instead left to stay — alone — within a nearby residence as they awaited their final exams.
It is in cases like these that Harvard’s twin goals of self-protection and student protection are not just at quiet odds with one another. Instead, they become actively antipodal ends of a perpetual and systematic game of tug-of-war. In this match, Harvard has the tools to implement its policies, and students are subject only to its arbitrary implementation – enabling the University, when push comes to shove, to preserve its lifeline threaded tightly by liability concerns.
A University spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the specific allegations of students Tuesday afternoon.
In a previous email inquiring about leave of absence policies, however, University spokesperson Rachael Dane sent me a short, two-line reply.
“As you know, page 44 of the Student Handbook explains the whole process for leaves,” it read. “We will not have further comment.”
Yet nowhere in this handbook’s pages could I find the stories — or the institutional practices that shaped them — that were illuminated throughout the course of my reporting. Perhaps that’s because institutional policies are not only about inky dents on canvas, or about pages of simplified rules. But the accounts that I have gathered since then, some of which are still untold, suggest that there’s much more to this mismatch between Harvard policy and practice.

UPDATED: April 6, 2022 at 12:18 a.m.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, who successfully led the charge to dissolve Harvard’s Undergraduate Council in favor of a new student government, resigned as president of the UC on Tuesday, leaving the transition to the new system in the hands of others.
Cheng’s resignation comes just days after undergraduates fulfilled his defining campaign promise — to abolish the UC in favor of a new system — by voting overwhelmingly to dissolve the 40-year-old body in a school-wide referendum.
The surprise move, announced Tuesday afternoon in a Crimson op-ed, adds to the uncertainty of the transition from the UC to the HUA, which will now be led by Cheng’s former vice president, Emmett E. de Kanter ’24.
“I was elected on the signature promise of dissolving and replacing the Undergraduate Council. Since that’s been fulfilled, I must step aside so we can turn to our next chapter,” Cheng wrote in an email to undergraduates Tuesday afternoon.
In a written statement, de Kanter lamented Cheng’s departure.
“Michael will be missed for his leadership, incredible work ethic, and kindness to all, and has left some huge shoes to fill,” de Kanter said.
de Kanter has selected Christopher T. Cantwell ’22-’23, former parliamentarian for the UC, as his vice president. The pair will serve as the student body’s interim leaders until HUA elections are held in the coming weeks. They will not seek election into the HUA, Cheng said.
In a separate email to the student body Tuesday, de Kanter and Cantwell committed to a smooth transition, with a promise to “ease off on emails.”
The pair also outlined a timeline for the transition process and affirmed the continuity of staple UC functions, such as summer storage and club funding.
Cantwell reiterated his desire for a drama-free transition in an interview Tuesday.
“I am honestly hoping to fade into the background relatively quickly,” Cantwell said. “I want to make sure that we’re able to uphold our core obligations to the student body.”
In their email to undergrads, de Kanter and Cantwell outlined the transition timeline and solicited applicants to serve on an interim election commission, which will be selected by the UC executive board.
Elections for the first HUA officers are set to take place by April 30, per the newly-adopted HUA constitution. The document mandates that an election timeline and rules be released by April 11.
According to Cantwell, at least seven students had applied by Tuesday night — enough to fill the commission.
The pair’s email also clarified the status of the UC during the transition.
“The UC will continue to exist as a legal entity in the next few weeks, but as per the referendum, the UC Constitution and Bylaws have been completely deleted, and the UC will be dissolved and replaced in an official ceremony by May 8,” they wrote.
de Kanter and Cantwell also alerted students that $10 in Crimson Cash had been awarded to each of them as a result of the UC’s dissolution. The funds were disbursed from a sum of $125,325.44 that was withheld from the UC for the duration of an audit of its finances.
House committees also received $500, while the remaining $50,000 was allocated toward club funding, according to de Kanter and Cantwell.

Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted overwhelmingly in favor of a proposal that will allow undergraduate students to pursue double concentrations at its monthly meeting on Tuesday.
Around 91 percent of faculty voted in favor of the plan, which will allow College students to study two fields without writing a joint thesis. The policy change will take effect in the fall.
Currently, undergraduates who want to study two disciplines must either pursue a joint concentration — which requires an interdisciplinary joint thesis — or add a secondary field of study, which has fewer requirements and less administrative support.
The double concentrations proposal allows up to eight credits — generally two courses — to be double counted between the concentrations.
The plan, which was first discussed by faculty members last month, was introduced by Undergraduate Education Dean Amanda J. Claybaugh.
Claybaugh said the change will open doors for students who want to pursue two unrelated fields, especially ones who would otherwise concentrate solely in a STEM field but have interest in the arts and humanities or social sciences.
But some faculty who opposed the plan said double concentrations could incentivize students to seek out another credential on their degree, limiting room for electives.
“What the legislation is changing is the credential that they have on their transcript,” said professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology David A. Haig.
The remark drew criticism from some faculty.
“With all due respect, I don’t think this is just a dichotomy between credentials and the substance of the student experience,” Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey said.
Kelsey added that people who choose to pursue a secondary field are often excluded from that department’s support and advising networks.
The double concentrations plan was crafted by a subcommittee formed in September by Harvard’s Office of Undergraduate Education.
The proposal also includes a five-year review, which would require the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy to analyze the impact of it in fall 2027.
Jeffrey D. Macklis, a professor of Life Sciences, said double concentrations will allow students to have access to personalized instruction in two fields. He said the proposal will not limit room for electives, but restructure them in a way “that allows depth in multiple fields.”
Claybaugh said a joint concentration has fewer course requirements than a double concentration, adding that a double concentration will be academically challenging and only be meant for students who are serious about pursuing rigorous coursework in both fields.
Faculty members also discussed a proposal to eliminate shopping week in favor of a previous-term course registration system, but ran out of time to vote on the plan, which will be taken up next month.
The previous-term course registration proposal would require instructors to plan course curriculum earlier and move advising timelines up. Students would be able to add or drop classes without instructor permission during the first week of the semester.
If adopted, the proposal would be implemented by a joint committee composed of faculty members, undergraduate and graduate students, and administrators. The policy would be reviewed by Harvard’s Faculty Council — a subset of the FAS that reviews legislation before it goes to the full body — within five years of its implementation.
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean Emma Dench spoke in support of the proposal, saying that shopping week can pose a burden for graduate students, who sometimes have to switch to a different teaching assignment at the last minute.
“I encourage colleagues to really be mindful of all of our students and the educational impacts on all of our students’ wellbeing,” she said.
But many faculty members still support retaining some form of shopping week, a longtime scheduling quirk that allows students to sample courses during the first week of the semester before officially enrolling.
Professor of German Peter J. Burgard called for the College to leave shopping week in place for freshmen in the interest of exploration, but move to a previous-term registration system for upperclassmen.
“Early registration is troubling for rising first and second-semester freshmen,” he said. “They can’t be advised in the same way in the spring about fall semester courses.”
Computer Science professor David J. Malan ’99 said shopping week is “one of Harvard’s most impactful traditions educationally,” despite the administrative planning difficulties it presents.
“It is not just an add-drop period in which to fine-tune decisions — it is an educational mandate from us to explore, a dedicated time to experience what courses are like, to discover yourself academically,” he said.
“And that culture of exploration, that uncertainty, that chaos changes students’ trajectories in college, if not beyond,” Malan added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Cambridge City Council committee unanimously recommended a policy order eliminating minimum requirements for off-street parking spaces for new developments during a virtual meeting Tuesday afternoon.
Under Cambridge’s current zoning code, developers must build at least one off-street parking space for each unit in a new residential building, with slightly different requirements for non-residential development.
Members of the Transportation and Public Utility Committee voted 5-0 to recommend a policy order authored by Councilors Burhan Azeem, Quinton Y. Zondervan, and Mark C. McGovern to remove this minimum parking space requirement. The order is likely to pass in the full Council, where five votes constitute a majority in the nine-member body.
If the order becomes law, Cambridge will join the growing list of major cities that have abolished parking minimums in recent years, including Minneapolis and San Francisco. Many others have implemented reforms significantly loosening parking requirements.
Azeem, the chair of the committee, gave a presentation about the policy order during the meeting, noting that parking minimums overestimate the true demand for parking in Cambridge.
“There’s a lot of evidence coming — as cities have started to move away from parking minimums — that parking requirements can be too high and suggests that cities are forcing developers to build parking that people don’t want, at a cost of housing units that people do want,” Azeem said in the meeting.
According to a 2020 report from the Cambridge Community Development Department, the share of both Cambridge residents and non-resident workers who drive to work has fallen significantly since 2000, while the share of people walking, biking, or taking public transportation has risen.
Councilor Paul F. Toner, who supported the order, called for “some oversight” to prevent developers from “abusing” the policy by not building sufficient parking.
“I know we dream of a future where nobody’s driving cars, but that future is not the immediate present,” Toner said. “We’ll just see people spilling out and further overcrowding of what's available on the public roadways.”
Azeem emphasized during the meeting that the order would not prevent developers from building parking.
“Developers can still build the same amount of parking,” Azeem said. “They can also choose to build less parking, but they would not be prevented from building the same amount of parking they would now.”
He added that developers often have financial incentives or contractual obligations to build parking spaces.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, who attended the meeting, said the passage of this order gives the Council an opportunity to consider ways for owners of existing unused parking spaces to convert them for other uses.
“There has to be a way for us to be creative in this moment, while we’re reimagining parking minimums, to allow for that possibility so that we can regain and recapture either that land for more car storage, or housing, or for a million other needs of the city,” Mallon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Washington Post columnist Michele L. Norris was awarded the 2022 Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism at an event hosted Tuesday by Harvard’s Shorenstein Center and the Harvard Institute of Politics.
Norris, a former host of NPR’s “All Things Considered,” discussed her career, the role of race in reporting, and the future of journalism in a 45-minute conversation with the Shorenstein Center’s director, Nancy R. Gibbs.
At the event, the Shorenstein Center also awarded the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting to Washington Post reporters Hannah Dreier and Andrew B. Tran for their coverage of climate refugees and the inequity in FEMA’s disaster response.
“The process of reporting these stories was often pretty wrenching and pretty lonely,” Dreier said, noting that few journalists had focused their investigative efforts on FEMA’s aid distribution.
The pair received $25,000 for the award, which honors work that “promotes more effective and ethical conduct” in government. The five finalists — including reporters for ProPublica, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, the Wichita Eagle, and the Nashville NPR affiliate WPLN — received $10,000 each.
Goldsmith Book Prizes were awarded to Karen Mossberger, Caroline J. Tolbert, and Scott J. LaCombe, who co-authored the book “Choosing the Future: Technology and Opportunity in Communities” and to Elizabeth H. Becker for her book “You Don’t Belong Here: How Three Women Rewrote the Story of War.”
In discussion with Gibbs, Norris reflected on her career in journalism, which has spanned nearly 40 years.
“I have been told something time and time again — the best of journalism is behind us — and I have refused to believe that that’s true,” Norris said.
“The worst of times tends to bring out the best in journalism,” Norris added. “We’re seeing that right now with Ukraine. We’re seeing that right now with the coverage of climate change. We’re seeing that right now with every one of the works of the nominees this evening.”
Norris also discussed her role in spearheading the Race Card Project, an initiative she founded to inspire conversations about race. The project, which has received over 500,000 submissions, asks people to submit a response capturing their experience with race in America in six words or less.
Norris said she has been surprised by the number of submissions and the diverse array of experiences and racial backgrounds covered in the project.
“One of the many things I have learned is that, when it comes to race, the story we tell is often incomplete,” Norris said. “We write about conflict, but not what is behind that conflict.”
Anjuli R. K. Shere, a Shorenstein Center fellow who attended the event, said she was “interested to hear the perspective” of the award winners.
“The future of journalism is probably individuals because of the crisis within news organizations — the mass layoffs that have happened during the pandemic,” she said. “Just individuals going out and finding stories themselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 8, 2022 at 8:08 a.m.
Harvard has received almost $385 million from sources in 46 countries since August 2019, according to United States Department of Education data.
Previously, a Crimson analysis of Department of Education data found that the University had received over $1.1 billion in foreign funding between Jan. 1, 2013 and July 31, 2019 — a figure later mirrored by an Education Department report in October 2020. Federal officials had been investigating whether Harvard and other universities complied with federal requirements for reporting foreign funding.
Following the investigation, Harvard updated its foreign funding reporting to include a “wider range” of contracts such as “the sale and licensing of academic publications” and “executive education programs.”
Section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 requires American universities to disclose contracts and gifts from foreign sources totaling more than $250,000 in a year to the Department of Education, per the department’s website.
The Education Department publishes the data in a regularly-updated online portal. The latest update to the portal revealed an additional $10.9 million in foreign funding received by Harvard prior to Aug. 1, 2019. The University reported these funds in 2020 and 2021 following the expansion of its reporting procedures.
Of the foreign funds Harvard received after August 2019, the University accepted $93.8 million through restricted gifts, $99.7 million through restricted contracts, $84.3 million through gifts, and $107 million through contracts.
Sources from China contributed $69.9 million to Harvard over the same time period, outpacing all other countries. Harvard received 12.9 percent of the total funding given to American universities by Chinese sources — the most of any school.
Additionally, 15.2 percent of overall contributions from Hong Kong to American universities since August 2019 went to Harvard, along with 6.8 percent of the total from England.
Harvard also received 66 percent, or $32.7 million, of total funding from Egyptian sources since August 2019. Of that sum, $31.8 million came from a single contract.
The University did not disclose any funding from Russia during the reporting window.
University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessey wrote that alumni and donor giving has “remained strong” following the conclusion of the University’s record-breaking capital campaign that raised $9.6 billion between July 2011 and June 2018.
“Throughout Harvard’s history, support from alumni and donors at all levels has been essential to our continued excellence in our research and teaching mission, which in turn enables Harvard’s critical impact in the world by helping to address society’s most pressing issues,” he wrote.
Hennessey attributed a portion of foreign donations to the 69,000 Harvard alumni who live in over 200 different countries.
These donations, he wrote, support financial aid, as well as “research in many critically important areas, student and faculty engagement and more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School hosted a virtual panel Tuesday discussing the impact of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in addressing health challenges in Latin America.
The talk featured University of Buenos Aires professor Laura Clerico, UN Senior Human Rights officer Christian Courtis, Argentine National Research Council fellow Liliana Ronconi, and Diana Guarnizo, a director at the Center for Study of Law, Justice and Society. Partners In Health Senior Advisor on Human Rights and Health Policy Alicia E. Yamin moderated the panel.
Yamin began the forum by drawing attention to what she called a Latin American paradox, noting the region possesses the “steepest socioeconomic inequalities in the world” despite its “broad constitutionalization of health rights.”
Founded in 1979, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has established case law in Latin America on the right to health. It has also regulated access to emergency care, HIV treatment, and health services for prison inmates.
Courtis highlighted a number of landmark cases from the court that center around the regulation of the private health sector, including Ximenes Lopes v. Brazil.
The Lopes case, brought before the court in 2006, established the recognition of health care as a “public good” after a patient died in a Brazilian psychiatric facility due to improper care.
Courtis said the case was the first to acknowledge the state has a responsibility to regulate and supervise private health providers and insurance companies.
Guarnizo said the duty of the state extends beyond setting regulations and called on governments to take an active role in monitoring the private health sector.
“In order to protect rights, states have the obligation not just to suppress any rules or practices that are against the rights, but also to provide norms, to create norms, to develop practices that make those rights effective and to make sure that those rights are effective in practice,” she said.
Following questions from the audience, Clerico concluded the panel by encouraging political activists and parties to join the court’s efforts for healthcare equity.
“We need some influential groups also to take part of the political agenda — the things related to the revolution of the health sector — because otherwise it is very difficult to transform this structure,” she said.

After spending the better part of two years desperately avoiding Covid, it finally infiltrated my suite. There’s never a good time to get the good ol’ Rona, but I can think of a thousand-and-one reasons why this was the worst week for it to all go down.
My first roommate started having symptoms Monday. Shortly thereafter, a rapid test was taken. BAM. Two red lines. One roommate was down. Three to go. Naturally, we all started freaking out — we never could have imagined this extremely likely scenario would happen to us. Who would be the last one standing?
Our suite was bursting with stress. More stress than the rest of the Harvard student body combined, and yeah, that’s saying something. And I, as a student-athlete, had exactly one week left in the season — so close, yet so far.
After testing negative — but staying positive — for three days in a row, things were starting to look up. We had probably been a little exposed but, hey, I didn’t even share a bedroom with our positive suitemate. The little tickle in my throat and my roommate’s sniffle were just stress, right? Or maybe spring allergies? Worst case scenario, the start of some mild frat flu I picked up from the Berg. That was nothing my immune system couldn’t conquer … right? The tests were still negative and we’d been leaving the windows open for air flow, so everything was … ok.
I was supposed to leave for New Hampshire with the team on Thursday. After hearing I was in close contact with my suitemate, my coach wasn’t jazzed about me getting in the van to drive three hours with the team. Luckily, my super-dad was flying across the country this weekend to come watch my last races, so the problem was solved: I’d drive to New Hampshire with my dad and isolate myself in my own room in the team house. All was well.
My dad and I got to New Hampshire, and the minute I stepped out of the car, I got a call from my fun and friendly roommate. And BAM. Another roommate down. Two more to go. This was becoming mildly catastrophic. I was really exposed at this point, and the tickle in my throat started to seem a bit more alarming. So observing more caution, I got a hotel room where my dad was staying, so I wouldn’t expose my teammates.
Fast forward and it’s Friday (race day) morning. I wake up, and I feel like I’ve been screaming at the top of my lungs at a Harry Styles concert. 15 minutes later and the rapid test confirms I am, in fact, Covid-19’s latest victim.
Well, obviously that squashed my race starts for the weekend, and I had also just exposed my chauffeur. Sorry, Dad! Ever the moral supporter — even though his dear daughter would be chilling in her hotel room all weekend — my dad masked up and went out to cheer for the other Crimson skiers.
I eventually made my way back to Cambridge after the weekend, accessorized in my N95 mask. Thanks to my dad, I was able to accumulate an enviable grocery haul to stock up for the rest of my isolation in Pennypacker — no, not just Trader Joe’s, but also Whole Foods. I joined my roommates, all of whom had Covid now, back in our suite. We then spent the weekend going on long walks, looking through social media at all the events we were missing, and “celebrating” my birthday in quarantine.
Did Covid ruin my season? No. Did it ruin this week? Pretty much. Have millions of people experienced this same exact inconvenience and much worse? Absolutely.
But hey, my symptoms were mild thanks to my three doses of the vaccine (shoutout Pfizer), and I’m coming out of quarantine a year older and with my sense of taste and smell. My roommates and I don’t hate each other (too much) despite spending DAYS with no other human contact, and I finally got caught up on the latest TikTok trends. Better yet, now I can start training for next season. And the best part of all: no more Color tests for the rest of the year. See you and your testing reminder texts later!
