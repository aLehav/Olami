After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s morning in Australia’s Dja Dja Wurrung country, and even over an international phone line, the songbirds’ celebrations lilt in and out of tune with singer-songwriter Harmony Byrne’s laugh. “Those little songbirds, I tell you, healed me so much!” Byrne says. She’s been living alongside them in the bush of Victoria — sans studio, company, or car — since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year. There, Byrne and the birds in the background recorded “The Songs I Sing When No One Is Listening,” an EP sent forth from the wilderness on Jan. 22 by a self-described “custodian of love.”
Like so many things since last March, this project was never part of Byrne’s plan. She was gearing up for the release of “Heavy Doors,” her genre-bending debut album a decade in the making, when a difficult year dealt her a one-two punch: lockdown and lost love. “It felt like a choice to become completely self-destructive or … destruct that fear, and that pain, and that loneliness,” she says. So Byrne bought a microphone, plugged it into a computer, and chose to chase beauty even in deeply unbeautiful times. Singing was a kind of self-healing. She never intended to share the results.
“There’s a big surrender that happened in releasing this EP, accepting it for what it was,” Byrne says. Writing and recording in a makeshift quarantine set-up meant swapping the bluesy brutalism of her studio work for barebones arrangements on an acoustic guitar. But given the chance to re-record her five new tracks in a sleeker setting, she ultimately opted to stick with the more stripped-down versions. As with her “Heavy Doors” vocal guide tracks, many of which unexpectedly made it into the final mixes, Byrne is intrigued by the authenticity of the originals. “You’re more natural when you think no one’s watching,” she says. “We create a beautiful world by sharing our gifts and our honest selves with the world, in our most natural way.”
Byrne seems to conjure up an endless supply of such aphorisms when she talks about music. Over time, the effect is holographic, producing a shimmering impression of her spiritual relationship to sound. As a child, she sang with her family’s church community; today, her songwriting philosophy is still rooted in the belief that “you’re a divine creation” and a voice is a gift. Even after years of writing and performing professionally, music remains mystical for Byrne. “I can’t even begin to understand what it really is,” she says. “It’s just magic. It’s just so powerful and moving. It’s the most beautiful relationship I have in my life that remains. It’s my one true love.”
One thing is certain, though: Music brings Byrne comfort. In the face of loss, songwriting helps prepare her heart for the long, steady process of recovery. Ever humble, she resists the implication that she could do the same for her listeners, but hopes her music inspires them to share their own stories. “I can’t really offer any healing, or any explanation or answer for why things are the way they are,” she says. “But I can hear you, and I can see you, and I can hold that.”
Now more than ever, Byrne believes, we need support. The world prizes the constraints of artificial beauty and strength — like auto-tune, which she mirthfully eschews — even (or maybe especially) when they harm people. “It’s a really confusing place to be: a part of these systems that seem to be built upon our pain,” Byrne says. But against all odds, she’s not cynical: She’s disappointed. “It’s really sad,” she says, her voice giving way a little. “We’re just these tender little things.”
Maybe Byrne’s new music can’t heal, but it can help by reminding listeners that they are not alone: “Love, family, and nature holds you, and it does love you, and it does care,” she says. She describes the first single from the EP, “The Good Days and The Bad Days,” as a mother’s voice reassuring a child that feeling broken and being broken are not the same thing. Her lyrical insight provides a tuneful echo of her conversational wisdom, shaping heartbreakingly true lines like, “Don’t question the good days, and don’t feel bad for the bad / It’s not your fault you can’t find happiness in a world that doesn’t care when you’re sad.” Byrne is singing to herself here, too. “There’s a thought in my head: ‘Oh, I’m always too much, I’m too much,’” she acknowledges. “And then I’m like, ‘Well, maybe you’re just enough.’”
So Byrne showed herself grace and released these five tracks, embracing their imperfections. Nowhere is her vulnerability more obvious than “Sparrow,” a love song which invites listeners into her sense memories and offers them new metrics for tenderness. About a minute and a half before the end of the track, Byrne’s controlled vibrato unravels, and suddenly, she’s singing the word “breathe” through halting tears, over and over again. The song is not about heartbreak, but the singer is heartbroken. It’s a shocking moment of honesty.
After pushing through to the end of the take, Byrne collected herself and recorded “Sparrow” again, but when listening back, she heard the familiar choir of songbirds accompanying her crying. “The birds told me that this is the one,” she says. “I just don’t think there’s any shame in showing our humanness.”
For Byrne, art is an expression of truth: It should be crafted, but never cultivated. And singers can connect best when they come as they are. Through the negative space on this minimalist EP, listeners can catch a glimpse of Byrne at her most sincere. That kind of openness, she believes, is both her privilege and her responsibility. “I feel like it is a gift,” she says. “Not just for myself, but for other people to share. And that’s my way of contributing somewhat to my community, and to the greater community of the world.”
“The Songs I Sing When No One Is Listening” is streaming now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faced with a global pandemic, a mass reckoning with racist government institutions, and Zoom fatigue — a sense of emotional exhaustion has collectively settled over society. Still, that hasn’t been able to stop Jon Batiste, whose soulful, synergistic energy is matched by few other artists; it has actually invigorated him to push forward.
The artist’s latest single, “I NEED YOU,” dropped on Jan. 22 and is the second single off of his upcoming album, “WE ARE,” which is set to release on Mar. 19. Batiste opens the song with a testament to “the new normal” and its tiring effects: “We done a lot of living / We working overtime.” The song is a dizzying and jubilant anthem of defiant joy, evocative of Batiste’s community-based musicianship. In a 2019 interview with Forbes, Batiste said: “All experiences of music at the highest connect us to something greater than ourselves, that is transcendent. It's a form of getting us all on the same page.” Leading by example on the first verse of “I NEED YOU,” he sings, “I couldn’t wait to blow my own horn / It ain’t wrong for you to play along / Playing this song ’til you die, come on.” It’s a warm invitation for the listener to join in as the beat drops, spinning into a musical fervor.
Last month, Batiste garnered praise for his musical contributions to Pixar’s “Soul,” the animation juggernaut’s first film with a Black lead. As the longtime band leader for “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and a Louisiana native, Jon Batiste has musical unification in his veins. For him, music is as much about bringing people together as it is about harmony and rhythmic swing. Last year, in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter Movement, he led peaceful protests all over New York centered on music. This was a significant act of homage to the indelible history of jazz as a form of protest music — and it was done with joy. Confronting systemic white supremacy and police brutality, Batiste’s soulful piano-playing and megaphone-like melodica celebrated Blackness and Black joy in a spiritual way, a symbolic act of resistance.
The single’s accompanying music video dynamic; Batiste brings an art gallery to life with song and dance, rising to the mighty challenge of matching the music’s energy. Notable is the multi-generational appeal of the choreography and costumes, reminiscent of the cultural past and ever-evolving future of jazz.
Adding to the hype, Batiste dropped an “I NEED YOU” dance challenge on Instagram, which features him swinging and stank face-ing his way through the song’s pre-chorus. Watching him perform adds an entirely new layer to the music: this is joy in its most unadulterated form. “In this world with a lot of problems / All we need is a little love,” he sings. Jon Batiste’s impetus for social connection through his music is on full display in “I NEED YOU.” In a time of such extreme social isolation, it is a beacon of hope, heralding a brighter future.
In a line that encapsulates his character, Batiste sings, “Thank you, thank you for your love.” What might the world look like if we all turned up the volume on our intrinsic empathy, hopping on the same wavelength as him? Batiste’s musical genius and effortless swagger are rare to come by, sure, but we can all try our hand at fostering radical joy, in our own way.

Every day, Michael J. Bobbitt wakes up at 6:30 a.m. to a quiet house (his husband sleeps in), thumbs through trade papers, maybe listens to the news. Four days a week, he trains with a friend who runs a Black-owned gym in Dorchester. “He kicks my butt for an hour,” Bobbitt said with an easy laugh. Amid the chaos of the world, he maintains a regimented schedule, assiduously protecting his health and his work. During a year marked by what he terms the “dual pandemics” of Covid-19 and systemic racism, these rituals give Bobbitt a sense of normalcy, allowing him to lean into the crisis and lead with compassion.
The director, choreographer, and playwright departed his post as artistic director at New Repertory Theatre in Watertown to join the Mass Cultural Council as its new executive director on Feb. 1. Despite entering his role at a time fraught with economic downturns and frenzied transitions to digital work, Bobbitt defended his audacity to dream big. “I’ve always thought of crises as opportunities,” he said. “I’ve thought of them as opportunities to make something better. So I always lean into them, and come out healthier, happier, stronger. I’m hoping that the arts and cultural world will do that — lean into what we’re in right now.”
Beyond his passion for supporting artists, the newly inducted director is a versatile artist himself. He trained as a European classical trumpeter in college, later transitioning to dance and theater. Adopting his now 19-year-old son compelled Bobbitt to reconsider his artistic trajectory — balancing “all the gigs” as a freelance artist made it too challenging to “be a dad,” he said. In the last ten years, Bobbit has come to realize his true passion lies in equipping artists with the resources to actualize their creative potential. “I just wanted to give work to artists, and give them everything they needed to do great work,” he said. “And then I would go out and make sure I found support for the work that they were doing.”
Rather than imposing his own vision, Bobbitt prefers to center the needs of artists themselves. In his first days helming the Council, Bobbitt said he remained deeply committed to — and exhilarated by — opportunities for collaborative dialogue. “I don’t aspire to make unilateral or arbitrary decisions,” he said. “I really love hearing from the various constituencies that we’re working with — which includes our council, our staff, our artists, our grantees, our local cultural councils, our partners, our legislators — to find out where we need and want to go.”
Though successful careers and sustainable lifestyles seem mutually exclusive, Bobbitt manages, somehow, to balance both. To decompress after work hours, Bobbitt indulges in TV — an all-time favorite is “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” which makes Friday a reason to celebrate — and scrolls through a seemingly endless bevy of Instagram reels. Beyond entertainment, he tries to squeeze in at least two or three calls with his son each week. Every night, Bobbitt uses a beaded bracelet as a tool to cultivate a mindset of gratitude. “I will touch each bead and name something I’m grateful for, which is kind of cool because I go through 30 or 40 things to remind myself that being grateful for what you have is pretty great,” he said.
Intentional living, however, is not merely a way for Bobbitt to maintain his physical health: It is a grounding ritual during a period of sociopolitical unrest. “Self-care is really important to me, especially during a stressful time of onboarding for a new job and, as a Black man, dealing with the racial reckoning that’s happening in the world, and also just dealing with the challenges of Covid,” he said. “Being healthy helps me navigate all of that well.”
In a time marked by national conversations regarding race and belonging, Bobbitt remains deeply committed to equity, both within the Council and across the industry. When assessing antiracism in arts and culture, Bobbitt acknowledges the need for structural, policy-driven reform while recognizing that, without cultural shifts, shifts in policy will be an incomplete solution. “The 1964 Civil Rights Act didn’t turn bigots into not being bigots,” he said. “It just made it illegal to discriminate against Black people. So policy can do a lot — it’s not going to fix the culture. It’s not going to change people’s hearts and minds.”
How can we — after the devastation wrought by both Covid-19 and sociopolitical developments — effectively move forward? How, in other words, can we heal? According to Bobbitt, the arts have been crucial for keeping people “healthy and vibrant” during these tumultuous times. This conviction aligns with the initiatives of the Council he now helms.
For instance, its CultureRx Initiative, launched in 2019, facilitates partnerships between healthcare providers and arts organizations. The program aims to provide discounts to cultural events for populations including low-income adults and children, veterans, and the eldery to build a “public infrastructure” that utilizes arts and culture as a “protective factor” in the health of state residents, according to the Council’s official website. Healthcare providers can prescribe going to an arts and culture event as “part of the healing” through the program, Bobbitt added. Through initiatives such as CultureRx, Bobbitt — as well as the Council at large — strives to leverage art as a redemptive force during a time of national restlessness.
Now more than ever, Bobbitt believes, the key to tackling the world’s most trying crises lies in the synergy between the arts and scientific innovation. He cites the creativity and radical empathy intrinsic to the artistic process as essential for national recovery. “Imagination is seeing the world differently,” Bobbitt said. “So there’s no one more qualified to imagine the world differently than artists. And I really believe that if we think about all the different things we’re struggling with in society — if we include artists in those conversations, who are expert imaginators, we can help solve so many things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Temperatures are literally rising for the Johnson family in an all-new episode of the ABC sitcom “Black-ish.” The show returned from its winter hiatus on Jan. 26, kicking off the second part of Season Seven, which began last October. In this mid-season premiere, a neighborhood-wide power outage on a hot day leaves Dre (Anthony Anderson) and Rainbow (Tracee Ellis Ross) to grapple with what community means to them, especially in times of crisis. “Black-out” brings the Johnsons into a new year, but it’s clear that the chaos and trauma that defined 2020 is still very much in their world, much like our own. When the power goes out across the neighborhood, beating the heat quickly becomes a family competition. As Dre launches straight into survival mode, stocking up on groceries and toilet paper in a sequence that pokes fun at the TP-hoarders of early 2020, Bow secures an invitation to cool off in another neighbor’s home.
But while most of “Black-ish”’s main cast assembles in the fictional heat to kick off the rest of the season, there is one thing that’s curiously absent from the show: the actual pandemic. “Black-ish” has long been known for the boldness and wit with which it tackles an array of social and political issues. And while the inaugural episode of Season Seven’s second half keeps it real in many ways, it’s still unclear which reality the Johnsons are living in, as almost all traces of the pandemic seemed to have disappeared. For example, a scene featuring a grocery store swarming with maskless shoppers is at once an alarming sight and a fond but distant memory. Continuity-wise, this shift is jarring, as the effects of the pandemic on the Johnsons was a centerpiece of Season Seven’s earlier storylines.
This diversion might, however, be for the best. The decision to abandon any in-world references to the Covid-19 pandemic might mean that “Black-ish” will miss out on some sharp commentary going forward, but the pandemic-free world in which its characters seem to be living is by no means unwelcome. It’s no stretch to assume that the vast majority of audiences have grown weary of seeing pandemic-related storylines on their televisions, costing many shows their escapist appeal. To this end, it’s certainly nice to see the Johnsons interact normally with their neighbors and engage in good old-fashioned tussles over grocery store items without the risk of spreading a deadly virus.
Nevertheless, the simple premise of this episode unearths many truths about being Black in America today, pandemic or not. Dre’s frantic preservationist efforts stem from his disillusionment with the idea of community as the only Black man in a very white Los Angeles neighborhood, knowing that, more often than not, he will be excluded from the cohesiveness and reciprocity that bind his neighbors together. Members of this community may tout their liberal leanings, but their concern with racial justice is largely performative — a reality underscored in the episode by the revelation that Dre has been racially profiled as a “possible looter” in the neighborhood monitoring app NextDoor. Though played for laughs, this moment demonstrates the plain reality that Blackness is consistently criminalized. Although Dre and Bow take divergent approaches to understanding their place within their neighborhood, each has something to learn from the other’s viewpoint and assumptions, as per usual: Indeed, it turns out that Bow’s invitation to spend time in another neighbor’s air-conditioned house is nothing more than a ploy to rope her into a multi-level marketing scheme with a microaggressive hook. Conversely, Dre’s cookout is ultimately salvaged by a neighbor’s propane tank. The episode’s dual case study in crisis management — Dre’s every-man-for-himself philosophy versus Bow’s belief in reciprocal altruism and community — converge to illustrate a point that both parties can agree on: The psychological toll of being the only Black family in a white neighborhood is incredibly real and absolutely necessary to acknowledge.
In some ways, “Black-out” almost feels like it’s been done before, at times leaning heavily on old character dynamics and situational cues while also underutilizing some of its funniest characters (the kids and Dre’s mother Ruby (Jennifer Lewis) aren’t given too much to dos). Nevertheless, the episode depicts some very real truths and wastes no time welcoming viewers back to the Johnsons’ world for the back half of Season Seven. Indeed, “Black-ish”, possibly having liberated itself from some coronavirus-related narrative constraints, is gearing up for a run of strong episodes, ripe with further antics and witty social commentary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s long list of 2021 Nobel Peace Prize nominees is two names longer thanks to Alan M. Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, who nominated former White House advisor Jared C. Kushner ’03 and his deputy Avrahm “Avi” Berkowitz last week for their work on the Abraham Accords.
We are surprised by neither the nominator nor the nominees, especially when considered in tandem. Dershowitz’s role in the nomination is hardly out of character; the high-profile attorney has long been an intimate companion of the Trump administration – a firm advocate of the establishment who has, over the past four years, championed the administration’s endeavors on cable news, in print, and in 280-character endorsements on Twitter. Dershowitz has also spent much of his fabled career building a prominent persona, and he has never shied from public attention nor the cases that garner it. This apparent appetite for controversy – paired with the attorney’s high-profile proclivities and firm support for the Trump family – contextualizes Kushner and Berkowitz’s contentious nominations.
But to be fair, the Abraham Accords are noteworthy in their own right. Sure, the agreement is controversial, with its output arguably bereft of any substantive acknowledgment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; yet it still represents the first public normalization of relations between the Arab world and Israel since 1994 – and that’s no small maneuver. Indeed, Kushner and Berkowitz’s efforts, at the very least, are a notable venture, a call whose loud echoes – constructive or not – have managed to reverberate across the geopolitical world. Given the sheer markedness of their simultaneously disrelished and lionized efforts, it seems only natural that Kushner and Berkowitz would land on the list of 2021 Nobel Peace Prize nominees.
So, perhaps Kushner and Berkowitz’s efforts in crafting the Abraham Accords are worthy of such high-level recognition – but can the same be said for Kushner and Berkowitz themselves? More broadly, in considering who deserves such attention and esteem, should we only probe singular, isolated actions? Or must we instead turn towards a more leveled exploration – a nuanced interrogation of all that they have championed, advocated, and accomplished?
We advocate for the latter – for a holistic, carefully integrated approach to evaluation. Kushner, for one, may have been acting in the name of peace through his work on the Abraham Accords; but, over the past four years, Kushner has also kindled conflict and ignited unrest. As former President Donald Trump’s senior advisor, he has tacitly enabled his father-in-law’s brinkmanship with North Korea and Iran; he has bred international distrust by affirming Trump’s withdrawal from countless multilateral treaties and organizations; and he has quietly watched as immigrants have been banned from seven predominantly Muslim countries under the Trump administration. Ultimately, Kushner’s “behind-the-scenes” ventures across the Middle East – his apparent efforts towards peace – do nothing to diffuse the disharmony that these other actions have propounded and provoked.
These standards, too, are by no means reserved for Nobel Laureates – they should, in fact, be carried and practiced within Harvard’s own gates.
In some of its most cherishable moments, the University has successfully risen to this very challenge. Just last month, for instance, the Harvard Institute of Politics clung tightly to this principle – to the importance of making holistic assessments when considering who it honors – when the organization boldly ousted U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) from her position on its Senior Advisory Committee following her dangerous claims of voter fraud.
Still, we at times see these tenets being overlooked at Harvard; we see the University making clouded, singular judgements rather than holistic, integrative considerations. Such was the case last semester, when the Government Department failed to sever ties with then Gov 50 Preceptor David Kane after his series of disgraceful, racist blog posts were unearthed. In making this decision, the department either failed to consider or chose to ignore Kane’s actions outside of the classroom and their effect on students.
Inevitably, this tension ripples and pulsates throughout our world – from the University to the Nobel Laureate level. Navigating such tension is no easy feat, but one thing is clear: To honor an individual, one cannot be blind the whole of their actions. We cannot award cowards for a single act of bravery; we cannot award the intolerant for a single act of inclusion; and we cannot award inciters for a single act of civility.

For decades, the size of Harvard’s student body hasn’t budged. Despite more and more proof of the sky-high value of a Harvard College degree and the University’s continuously growing applicant pool, administrators haven’t taken the logical next step: to let in more students.
Harvard now sits fourth among the eight Ivy League schools in its undergraduate enrollment totals, trailing Penn and Cornell substantially, as well as Brown by a small amount.
Yet Harvard might be the only one in this elite club to have seen such stagnant growth in its enrollment for so long. About 2,200 high schoolers were admitted to Harvard’s Class of 1982. That number was 2,147 in 1992, 2,074 in the mid-2000s, and just 1,980 for this year’s freshman class. Because the yield rate — the percentage of admits who choose to enroll — has risen steadily since the 1980s, the freshman class has stood virtually unchanged at approximately 1,600 students for more than four decades.
Yet Cornell, Dartmouth, and Brown have all seen their student bodies grown by at least 15 percent since the 1980s. Yale’s enrollment was steady for decades until it expanded its freshman classes by nearly 20 percent beginning with the Class of 2021. Harvard’s enrollment? No significant change to speak of.
Upping total admits by, say, 20 percent, would be a huge start. Just that small increase, administered thoughtfully, would help the University begin to atone for its dark history of class- and race-based exclusion by wielding its most precious asset — the golden ticket of admission.
So what could the University do with these 320 highly sought-after new spots?
How about using 300 of them to admit only students from the bottom 50 percent of the United States’ income distribution? After all, the College’s lack of socioeconomic diversity is downright pitiful (almost as many students hail from the top 0.1 percent of the income spectrum as from the entire bottom 20 percent).
Perhaps the final 20 new spots could go to members of Massachusetts’s Indigenous communities, on whose ancestral land Harvard now occupies.
Yes, growing the freshman class would let the University have its cake and eat it too. Rather than adopting needed reforms like ending preferences for legacy students, the expansion would allow Harvard to tout its increased socioeconomic diversity without upsetting its most influential donors. Yet these reforms clearly aren’t in the offing, and we have no time to lose.
Aside from the positive press that an enrollment boost aimed at low-income Americans would produce, consider all that these new students would bring to campus. Vital new perspectives. The grit, ambition, and wherewithal that comes from weathering financial adversity.
Well, how about the price tag? Let’s say, at most, $150,000 per student each year (almost all new enrollees would receive full financial aid of roughly $75,000, on top of costs Harvard absorbs even for its full-tuition-paying students). That’s less than $200 million in additional expenses annually with all four class years expanded by 20 percent.
Compared to the eye-popping $9.6 billion capital campaign the University wrapped up in 2018 ($1.3 billion of which went towards financial aid), that investment seems entirely attainable, either drawn from the existing round of fundraising or a new one devoted to this effort in particular.
So how might Harvard administrators respond to this proposal? “We just don’t have the physical space to grow our enrollment,” they might say. Harvard Yard can’t get bigger, after all!
Yet for years, the College has already been placing students in overflow housing. It began with DeWolfe, then the Inn, and then other makeshift apartments in Harvard Square. And almost by the day, Harvard is inking new land deals in Allston. How about a plot devoted to new dorms?
Or better yet, to avoid further gentrifying the other side of the Charles River, let’s avoid new dorms altogether. Now that so many undergraduates have experienced off-campus living during the Covid-19 pandemic, the cat might be out of the bag. Paying Harvard more than $18,000 for room and board? Going in with a few roommates for an apartment near the Square now seems to many like a better deal.
The issue of Harvard’s enrollment size came up briefly in 2018, when Joshua S. Goodman, a former assistant professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, suggested expanding the student bodies at elite schools amid the ongoing admissions lawsuit against the University, in order to “lower everyone's blood pressure when it comes to admissions.”
Yet apart from such rare mentions, Harvard’s enrollment gets very little attention. Well, it should.
On top of letting the country enjoy more YouTube videos of teary high schoolers finding out about their acceptance to Harvard, Harvard’s precious admissions slots could be employed for truly bold and noble ends. What are we waiting for?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
America is fast approaching its first Valentine’s Day with the novel coronavirus. The pandemic seems likely to challenge the traditional understanding of Valentine’s. What will Valentine’s Day look like in a year when masks and physical distancing are advised on even this most romantic holiday? If you’re distressed by this prospect, a review of Victorian medicine suggests an interesting cure to your 2021 Valentine’s ails. Down with the flu? Exhausted by Expos papers or CS50 homework? Lost your mojo? Sip on some Valentine’s Meat Juice, a 19th century patent medicine that claimed to provide the health benefits of raw meat without the digestive struggles. But, before you run out to find this tonic, let’s dig into its history.
Like any good valentine, this one involves romance. In 1870, a love-struck Mann S. Valentine was desperate to nourish his wife, who was suffering from a severe digestive disorder. Valentine experimented to find a cure. The resulting love potion? Valentine’s Meat Juice. Dosed orally or rectally, this juice was used to treat ailments ranging from influenza to gastritis. Made from only the finest cattle (“Texan beef will not do”), it claimed to provide “the germ of life … in a state ready for immediate absorption.”
Valentine was not the first to debut such a product. In 1847, German chemist Justus von Liebig had manufactured a similar meat extract. Liebig is famed for developing the hands-on lab approach to teaching chemistry; multiple Harvard faculty members trained under him in Germany. By 1899, Liebig’s product was trademarked as OXO, of the still-widely used European OXO cubes. Though marketing beef blocks as romantic may seem like a stretch, in the 1950s OXO leaned into mid-century gender tropes, advertising its bouillon cubes as an affordable way for housewives to give “a meal man-appeal!” Like OXO, Valentine’s Meat Juice was a commercial success. Thanks to this energizing tonic, Valentine amassed enough wealth to establish and endow a museum.
A rosy tale for a Valentine’s product? Not quite. Guns and roses would be more apt. On July 2, 1881, just months after his inauguration, U.S. President James A. Garfield was shot twice at point-blank range. Desperate physicians sought to save him. Alexander Graham Bell, famed for inventing the telephone, developed a metal detector especially to locate a bullet within Garfield. Physicians supplemented this innovative technology with none other than Valentine’s Meat Juice. Per the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, on July 12 Garfield consumed: “... twenty-nine ounces of milk, with an ounce of rum ... a small slice of milk toast … a small sandwich of scraped raw beef, with two teaspoonfuls of Valentine's beef juice and an ounce of Tokay wine of 1868.” Rum, wine, meat juice, and raw beef. Somehow, Garfield survived for 79 days after being shot, with his physicians publicly reporting on everything from his pulse to the size and consistency of his bowel movements.
Just weeks before Garfield’s final sips of Valentine’s Meat Juice, 19-year-old American Florence Chandler married Englishman James Maybrick, who was more than double her age. Alas, their marriage was not happy: Both soon had affairs. In March 1889, Florence boldly traveled to London for a hotel getaway with her paramour, a Mr. Alfred Brierley. Just two months later, on May 11, 1889, Maybrick died, and this is where things really get juicy (or shall we say… meaty?). An autopsy suggested that Mr. Maybrick had ingested arsenic. While some claimed Mr. Maybrick had been exposed by willfully consuming unregulated patent medicines, the jury found itself caught on a rather sticky detail: Florence Maybrick’s abundant purchases of fly-paper. At the time, fly-paper was made with arsenic. She claimed to have extracted the arsenic for use as a cosmetic. This explanation would not fly today, but beauty products like “Arsenic Complexion Wafers” were widespread in Victorian Britain.
Nonetheless, the jury was unconvinced by Mrs. Maybrick’s account. Only one question remained: How did fly-paper arsenic end up inside Mr. Maybrick? Per the Harvard Law Review, there was “arsenic in the meat-juice” at the Maybrick home, but “Valentine’s meat-juice is not made with arsenic.” The explanation for this mismatch of meaty ingredients? Mrs. Maybrick was suspected of having extracted arsenic from the fly-paper and fed it to her husband in his meat juice. It took the jury only 35 minutes to conclude that Mrs. Maybrick, enamored with another man, had poisoned her husband. She was sentenced to hanging. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and the Maybrick widow ultimately served 15 years.
The final twist? Mr. Maybrick was posthumously accused of being not one, but two, notorious serial killers: the Servant Girl Murderer, who killed eight women in Austin, Texas between 1884 and 1885, and Jack the Ripper, who murdered (at least) five women in London in 1888. Were these Maybrick’s final acts of passion before his own murder? Perhaps. Others think Florence Maybrick was framed by one of her husband’s brothers – the brother, so it’s said, was the real Jack the Ripper. Is it any wonder that, upon her release from prison, Florence returned to America to live out her days with dozens of cats? Perhaps a socially distant Valentine’s isn’t all that bad…

To AP because I don’t know what’s going on in your life anymore and we should catch up but we’re both terrible texters. To AW because the last time I talked to you I called you a jerk, oops.
To DK for being my first crush and never accepting my follow request on Instagram. To NC for making me download Snapchat and being my longest streak until I deleted the app. To JY for kick-starting my love of ice skaters and poetry about bugs.
To AD because you’re insane, man, you can’t just tell us that you like pain and end the conversation there. To SC because you have irrevocably altered my sense of humor. To KF because I literally never knew you and then we started texting and then we stopped and now I don’t know you again. To SZ for every day we spent at the library together last summer.
To JH because we never talk as much as we should and when you hugged me last summer I wish the doors of the T had held off on closing for just a little bit longer. To HK because I think of you every time I see a pretty sky. To WL because I did end up trying Le’s, and now it’s my favorite restaurant in Harvard Square.

I leave people behind in life like a trail of early exits and connections gone cold, and it’s only gotten worse with age. Especially now in college, when the face of every new person I meet at a party with the music too loud and every classmate suffering in the same breakout room fades too quickly into the amorphous mass of people I have already forgotten.
I want to know you all better. I want to go back to when we knew each other so well we could wear each other’s skins inside-out. Or if I never knew you that way, I want to spend the honest hours of 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. with you until we do.
But, at least for now, our time has passed and our paths have crossed. I suffer from main character syndrome in that I end up thinking of you all as supporting cast, background characters No. 43 and No. 44 who are there to provide exposition or parallel past encounters. I think of all the ways you have touched my life and not the ways I’ve touched yours.
Maybe I was remiss in calling you someone who has since forgotten about me. Maybe you miss me too. So shoot me a text, or I’ll shoot you one. I love you, or I loved you, and we should catch up.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College senior student athletes whose seasons were canceled due to Covid-19 will have the opportunity to compete for Harvard as graduate students next year in a departure from longstanding Ivy League policies barring graduate students from competition, Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott announced Thursday.
The Ivy League presidents granted a temporary waiver to Ivy League senior student athletes who lost a season of competition due to the coronavirus, McDermott wrote in an email to senior student athletes.
The Ivy League will allow current senior student athletes an extra year of eligibility as full-time graduate students during the 2021-2022 academic year. Students must be admitted as graduate students “through regular channels” at their undergraduate university to be eligible for this waiver, McDermott wrote. Students must receive approval from their fifth year advisor and the Ivy League office.
The waiver is an “unprecedented opportunity” for senior athletes considering graduate studies at Harvard, McDermott wrote, though she acknowledged it may be “difficult to take advantage of” due to the decision’s timing.
“In granting this waiver, the Presidents acknowledge the unique impact of the pandemic during the current academic year across all three sport seasons for those students in their final year of Ivy League eligibility,” she wrote. “This change is a direct result of the pandemic and will not be available in future years.”
After canceling the spring 2020 sports season in March as a result of the then-nascent health crisis, the Ivy League also canceled its fall and winter sports seasons for the 2020-2021 year because of the pandemic.
After various collegiate athletics conferences canceled spring sports last spring, the NCAA granted an extra year of eligibility to athletes who were not able to compete due to Covid-19. In response to the NCAA ruling, the Ivy League released its own announcement, doubling down on its longstanding policy barring graduate students from participating in athletics.
McDermott’s email Thursday marks a reversal of that statement.
The Ivy League is expected to announce its decision for the spring sports season later this month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund and of the Southern Black Girls Consortium, discussed her experience mobilizing voters during a Thursday event at the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.
Brown opened the event by singing “Oh, Freedom,” an African-American freedom song that played a prominent role in the Civil Rights movement.
In the discussion, which was moderated by Kennedy School professor Khalil G. Muhammad, who studies history, race, and public policy, Brown said her family's history of enslavement in Alabama and her childhood in Selma have informed her organizing work.
“In the 90s, I started doing voter work because I started understanding that if we want to change policy, we have to engage people in the political process,” she said.
Brown said she had little campaigning knowledge when she entered politics as a candidate for the State Board of Education in Alabama. At the time, she was a single mother in her 20s.
Brown said her organizing background was ultimately a political strength in the campaign.
“What I didn't know is that it was considered such an uphill battle. What I knew how to do is to organize. That's what I knew how to do. And so what I did is I organized,” Brown said.
Brown said Black people play a vital role in upholding American democracy.
“The narrative has been reduced to ‘Black people were fighting for the right to vote in this democracy in this country,’ as if there was something so significant and wonderful about the country and they themselves were secondary, when in fact, it wasn't that,” Brown said. “In fact, it was Black people were fighting for their humanity, Black people were fighting to operate in their agency, and they saw democracy as a tool, as a means to an end to get them there.”
Brown mentioned several moments in her career when she faced physical dangers due to her work and listed several points in her career where she came under threat because of her work. She once stayed in an Airbnb that was set on fire, she said.
“Black organizations and Black leaders that do this work, that are literally shifting power, are constantly under attack,” Brown said. “But in spite of that, because I know the history, because I know that that's par for the course, because I know where I am and the environment, I've learned to really be able to navigate through that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Wednesday he is “hopeful” the Department of Justice will side with Harvard should the Supreme Court take up a lawsuit brought against the University by the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
The Justice Department dropped a similar lawsuit accusing Yale University of discriminating against white and Asian American applicants on Feb. 3, a move that Bacow called “a good signal” for Harvard in its admissions lawsuit.
“I was pleased when the Justice Department dropped the Yale lawsuit, and I would certainly hope that they would support our position on affirmative action should the case go to the Supreme Court,” Bacow said.
Legal experts expect the DOJ under President Joe Biden to pull its support for SFFA’s lawsuit, which would mark a reversal of its Trump-era support for challenges to affirmative action.
“Based upon the kinds of statements the president has made in his prior life and the immediate action in dropping the Yale lawsuit, I’m hopeful,” Bacow said.
It remains unclear whether the Supreme Court will accept the case once SFFA appeals a Nov. 12 ruling by the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals that upheld the legality of Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies. The appeal is expected in the coming weeks.
Bacow said it “remains to be seen” how much of an impact the Justice Department’s support would have if the case were to reach the Supreme Court.
“It certainly can’t hurt,” he said.
Biden’s nominee for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, Kristen M. Clarke ’97 — who would oversee the DOJ’s position on cases related to discrimination — is one of at least 63 Harvard affiliates joining the new administration’s ranks.
“Certainly there are many people in the Biden administration who are well-known to the institution, and we look forward to working with them,” Bacow said.
The Justice Department's reversal in the Yale suit comes following four years of conflict between Harvard and the federal government over issues including affirmative action and immigration.
Bacow wrote a letter to Biden in December calling on him to “act without delay” to support visa leniency for international students. He said Wednesday that he appreciates the steps the new administration has taken so far, and acknowledged “they are limited in terms of how quickly they can act” while many appointees await approval from the Senate.
Currently, only previously-enrolled international students can stay in the United States while taking fully-online courses.
“We’re grateful for the efforts of the administration in that they have understood the challenges that institutions like ours face, and they are taking steps certainly in the right direction from our perspective,” Bacow said.

A non-profit website, run in part by Harvard College students and incubated in the University’s iLab, is pushing forward in its mission to provide free aid to those working through immigration applications.
ImmigrationHelp.org helps users file for naturalization, green cards, work and travel permits, and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, simplifying what can be a long and complex process, according to executive director and co-founder Jonathan Petts.
“My dad was an immigrant to the U.S. in the 70s,” Petts said. “The sad thing is that in the last four years, my dad’s dream was basically impossible for most low-income immigrants from Latin America, from Africa, from the Caribbean.”
Last year, undergraduates became involved with the organization through the College’s Mindich Service Fellowship, a 10-week public service summer internship program.
Some students — like Fernando Urbina ’22 and Lavinia Teodorescu ’22 — chose to continue working at the nonprofit even as the summer came to a close.
Urbina, a director of outreach and a member of the founding team, said he “fell in love with the work” and was inspired to help others as the son of a Mexican immigrant.
“I remember my mom went through a very complicated naturalization process,” Urbina said. “I wanted to be part of a team that helps streamline immigration processes for people so that accessibility could be increased for immigrant communities.”
Teodorescu, an international student who also directs media relations for the group, said she was moved to work for ImmigrationHelp.org last spring after noticing an uptick in immigrants facing legal troubles amid the intensifying pandemic.
“We all needed to be safe, and other people had to worry about ‘Am I safe, just by being in my home?’” Teodorescu said. “That should be a clear response, ‘yes, you’re safe by being in your home,’ but that wasn't the case for many people.”
In the last month alone, more than 500 people have used ImmigrationHelp.org, per Teodorescu.
Requests to help file DACA applications make up most of the site’s traffic, according to Petts. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to preserve DACA, a policy that protects undocumented youth.
Petts said Biden’s presidency marked “a new day” for low-income immigrants.
“I never want to count chickens before they've hatched,” he said. “But I'm so optimistic about the prospect of the next four years in creating a permanent path for some of our users to live in the country.”
Near the end of fall semester, Jaya J. Nayar ’24 received an email that ImmigrationHelp.org was seeking a volunteer for winter term. Nayar said she volunteered with ImmigationHelp.org by writing grants to help the nonprofit offer more services such as financial training and job coaches via their website.
Given her father’s immigrant background, Nayar said that ImmigrationHelp.org was an “amazing opportunity” to give back to immigrant populations.
“With Biden in power, he’s easing up immigration restrictions so there’s going to be a flood of people coming in,” Nayar said. “We don’t want to get backlogged, so it’s important that we have organizations that have a wider capacity to help immigrants apply for things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed legislation last week seeking to decriminalize the use, possession, and distribution of entheogenic plants, the latest in a series of steps toward more comprehensive decriminalization in Cambridge and Massachusetts.
The measure, which passed by an 8-1 margin during a Feb. 3 meeting, states controlled substance use should be viewed as a public health issue, citing possible medical benefits in treating conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.
While the use of entheogens — a category that includes psilocybin or “magic” mushrooms — remains illegal at the state and federal levels, the order calls on Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan to cease prosecuting all cases involving entheogens as well as any controlled substance cases without intent to distribute. It also directs city officials to treat arrests on those charges as the lowest law enforcement priority.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, one of the order’s sponsors, said the action was a “low-hanging fruit,” but one that lays the groundwork for more comprehensive decriminalization efforts.
“This is a particular case where we can push the envelope a little bit,” Zondervan said. “To get to broader decriminalization we need more help from our state and federal lawmakers.”
The policy order is the second of its kind in Massachusetts, following a nearly identical resolution passed by the Somerville City Council on Jan. 14.
The Massachusetts Coalition for Decriminalization — a collaboration between a number of local advocacy groups — helped draft both measures. The coalition includes groups such as Decriminalize Nature Massachusetts and Bay Staters for Natural Medicine.
Frank Gerratana, a member of Decriminalize Nature Massachusetts, said the order was based on a 2019 Oakland, Calif. bill decriminalizing entheogens. He said the organization began to draft Cambridge’s order soon after the Oakland bill’s passage.
“Cambridge has a long history of being a leader in progressive issues,” Gerratana said. “If the [state] legislature sees that a lot of towns and cities are already doing this, then they're gonna pay much closer attention and be a lot more interested.”
Gerratana said the group believes there is interest for similar legislation in larger Massachusetts cities including Boston, Worcester, and Springfield. The coalition has also been in touch with state legislators in hopes of bringing the issue to Beacon Hill in the near future, he added.
One such bill is expected to be put forth by State Representative Mike Connolly (D-26th Middlesex), whose district encompasses most of Cambridge and Somerville. The bill will propose a committee to examine the issue of statewide entheogen decriminalization.
A critical element of the decriminalization movement's argument, Gerratana said, is recent medical research suggesting psychedelics including psilocybin may be effective in treating chronic mental illnesses such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration declared psilocybin a “breakthrough therapy” in treating depression and accelerated clinical trials of the drug.
Cambridge City Councilor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., who offered the sole dissenting vote on the policy order, wrote in an email he would have liked to hear more on the public health aspect of the issue.
“At the time of the vote I felt that I did not have enough information on the potential impacts of decriminalization of this category of plants and would have preferred that this matter had a committee hearing that allowed for proper input from our public health and public safety officials,” Toomey wrote.
Addressing critics of the measure, Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, who helped sponsor the measure, wrote in an email that the “War on Drugs” has been ineffective and that it is time for the city to reconsider its priorities.
“Substance abuse is an issue that is going to continue to need to be addressed, but criminalization as the focus has not worked well,” Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote. “Treating substance use through a public health lens and addressing underlying reasons that people turn to substances — like housing insecurity and lack of healthcare — is a more effective approach.”
Zondervan said he agrees it is important to address addiction through treatment rather than incarceration.
“Ultimately, it was a matter of racial justice,” Zondervan said. “Dismantle the war on drugs, and get people the treatment that they deserve, and stop criminalizing adults using substances.”

The Harvard University Native American Program, Stanford University’s Native American Studies Program, and Stanford’s Native American Cultural Center jointly hosted prominent Indigenous scholars at a panel discussion in celebration of their programs’ 50th anniversaries on Thursday.
The event — titled “A Circle of Notable Native American Scholars” and co-sponsored by the American Academy for Arts and Sciences — drew nearly 700 virtual attendees. Its panel featured Philip J. Deloria, a history professor at Harvard; K. Tsianina Lomawaima, a professor in the School of Social Transformation at Arizona State University; Henrietta Mann, a professor emerita at University of Montana, Missoula and Montana State University, Bozeman; Robert Warrior, a professor at University of Kansas; and Greg Sarris, an endowed chair at Sonoma State University.
Before the panelists spoke, Anna Kate E. Cannon ’21, a co-president of Natives at Harvard College and a former Crimson Fifteen Minutes executive, provided a land acknowledgement for the space occupied by Harvard.
“Everyone at Harvard has benefited from the continued occupation of this land, and we must acknowledge our indebtedness to our Massachusett relatives,” she said.
The discussion centered on the importance of Indigenous studies and the experiences of Native Americans in higher education.
Mann, who is Cheyenne, acknowledged that teaching Indigenous history is “daunting,” given there are 574 federally recognized Indigenous nations, each with their own histories. Nevertheless, she said that it is a necessary pursuit.
“Harvard and Stanford have an obligation to teach about the nation or nations upon whose ancestral lands they are situated, and the nations located within each of their states, federally recognized or not,” Mann said.
Lomawaima said Indigenous scholars have often been “marginalized outsiders” in higher education but have also served as “hopeful transformers” of academic institutions. She emphasized the importance of developing programs like those at Harvard and Stanford.
“Indigenous studies play a critical role in public education,” Lomawaima said. “Our classes and interactions with students can serve as pathways for non-Native learners to encounter historical truths about the nation they call home.”
Warrior — a member of the Osage Nation who was denied tenure while he taught at Stanford in the 1990s — said his experience during the process revealed some of the challenges Indigenous scholars face in institutions of higher education.
“With the negative news about my tenure chase in the winter of 1999, I was suddenly the one having to deal with the institution telling me I didn't belong,” he said. “I'd done good work, the official notification from the dean told me, but what I did was too narrowly focused. American Indians, in other words, weren't a big enough concern to justify tenure at Stanford.”
During his time at Stanford, Warrior said he noticed many of the Native students he knew felt marginalized at higher education institutions, where they make up a fraction of the student body.
“Belonging was at the root of problems many Native students were facing, not just on that campus, but across the continent,” Warrior said. “As a mentor dedicated to helping Native students succeed, I looked for ways to reinforce the fact that we belonged.”
Native Americans and Native Hawaiians make up just 2 percent of Harvard’s Class of 2024.
Mann stressed the importance of creating enclaves within college campuses to support Native students. She praised the Native American Student Hall at the University of Montana and a similar space opening this fall at Montana State University as examples of such locales.
“Students need to have a place where they can gather, where they can create their own sense of community, where they can just be who they are, as our land's beloved children,” Mann said. “A place that gives them the feeling of being at home and that they belong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two women who were victims of sexual misconduct by former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez criticized the findings of an external review into Domínguez’s misconduct and urged the University to take stronger measures to address sexual harassment.
In 2018, the Chronicle of Higher Education published a pair of articles in which 18 women publicly accused Domínguez of repeated acts of sexual misconduct, establishing a pattern that extended across four decades. The University had, in fact, found Domínguez guilty of sexual harassment against former Government assistant professor Terry L. Karl in 1983.
The external review identified failures in Harvard’s enforcement of its own sanctions against Domínguez following Karl’s complaint. Following an investigation, then-dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Henry Rosovsky prohibited Domínguez from receiving administrative appointments for the next three years. Yet just two years later, in 1985, Dominguez was appointed to chair the Special Appointments Committee in the Government department and the FAS Foreign Cultures subcommittee of the Core Curriculum.
In a Monday emailed statement to The Crimson, Karl disputed the report’s conclusion that, “for its time,” the University’s response to her complaint in 1983 was “appropriate and admirable in many ways.”
Karl wrote that while American attitudes and policies surrounding sexual harassment have changed over time, “sexual harassment was made illegal in the workplace in 1980.”
“In the Dominguez case, for example, using the ‘times have changed’ excuse is misleading,’” she wrote. “Yes, the Women’s Movement, Anita Hill, MeToo, and the actions of Harvard women and a few of its highly appreciated men have changed the culture. But in 1980, as stated above, the Harvard administration knew that sexual harassment was illegal and further knew that its actions were wrong.”
Karl also contested the report’s finding that a failed institutional memory enabled Domínguez’s sexual misconduct to persist, pointing to a report on sexual harassment at Harvard by then-Associate Dean for Undergraduate Education Sidney Verba ’53 presented to the Faculty Council in September 1983.
“This knowledge has been ‘at Harvard’s fingertips since 1983,’ one person wrote to me, and all subsequent Harvard administrators as well as the department chairs ‘knew or should have known’ the pervasiveness of harassment,” Karl wrote.
Karl further wrote that Harvard did not respond effectively to complaints raised about Domínguez, enabling him to rise in Harvard’s ranks and gain influence.
“By ignoring this history, remaining silent or covering up, Harvard permitted Dominguez to continue to harass students, staff and at least two other non-tenured faculty for almost four decades while eventually being promoted to Vice Provost,” Karl wrote, referring to Domínguez’s appointment as inaugural Vice Provost for International Affairs in 2006. “The damage to uncounted women and the loss of their scholarship and success has been enormous.”
In a Wednesday interview, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said that Harvard would create a “centralized process” to access personnel records, after the external report stated Harvard’s decentralized structure “could have impeded” efforts to vet Domínguez for leadership positions.
However, Charna E. Sherman ’80, a former Government concentrator who was harassed by Domínguez, wrote in an emailed statement that centralizing personnel records would not address structural issues that “systemically protect” those in power committing acts of sexual misconduct.
“President Bacow’s out-of-the-gate announcement yesterday to centralize personnel records is little solace to current victims of sexual misconduct by tenured predators,” she wrote. “His reported comments create a false equivalence between personnel records and sexual harassment reporting.”
At Harvard, anonymous disclosures of sexual misconduct can be made to Harvard’s Title IX office, but only formal complaints are investigated by the Office for Dispute Resolution, which determines whether a policy violation has occurred.
“In line with due process requirements, disciplinary actions can only result from formal investigations,” the external committee report states. “While disclosures are recorded in the Title IX Office, they cannot be accessed for personnel decision-making.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Karl and Sherman’s statements.
Karl added that while she was “appreciative” of the apology that Bacow issued to her alongside the report last week, she did not feel vindicated by it.
“Vindication comes from the gratification women feel in trying to protect others and themselves – whether we get it or not,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Weeks after student organizers at Columbia University announced a tuition strike to protest their administration’s “flagrant disregard” for proposed university-wide demands, Harvard student activists have not indicated if they will organize a tuition strike of their own.
In a November letter, strike organizers at Columbia called on their administration to lower tuition costs, increase financial aid, dismantle the campus private police force, and halt the University’s expansion into West Harlem.
If these concerns were not addressed, more than 2,000 Columbia students were prepared to withhold tuition payments and donations to the university, per the letter. As of Feb. 11, more than 4,400 students have signed a petition in support of the strike.
While Harvard’s unions and activist groups have publicly supported the Columbia organizers, they have not indicated if they plan to launch a similar effort.
Brandon J. Mancilla, the president of the Harvard Graduate Students Union - United Automobile Workers, wrote in an email that the union is not planning for a tuition strike, citing that such action would fall under the domain of undergraduate organizers.
“Our union, HGSU, negotiates the wages, rights, benefits, and protections of student workers, not the tuition that undergraduates and other graduate students (specifically masters students and professional school students) pay,” Mancilla wrote. “Thus, it is not our place or purpose to initiate such an action.”
Mancilla added that, if tuition-paying students decide to strike, HGSU-UAW would support their initiative.
“This Columbia action was taken by undergraduates. If such a thing were to happen at Harvard it would be led and organized by Harvard undergraduates,” he wrote.
Ruy A. Martinez ’22, co-chair of the Harvard College Young Democratic Socialists of America, wrote in an email that the chapter’s members were “inspired” and “amazed” by the organizing efforts of the Columbia YDSA chapter.
“The only way to unite the student body in such a forward action is through solidarity as part of a multi-racial working class coalition that fights for justice at all levels in this school,” Martinez wrote. “Regardless of our goals relating to the University and tuition, this is our chief organizing principle, and is the most important takeaway from the powerful and inspiring tuition strike at Columbia.”
Martinez did not say if his organization was planning to announce a tuition strike of its own.
Matthew A. Gamero, a sophomore at Columbia and a strike organizer, said withholding tuition provides students with the opportunity to use financial leverage against the University.
“What brought me into the strike was recognizing all the power that students have,” Gamero said. “We can collectivize and organize to create a movement to hold leverage against those who we thought we couldn't ever influence or even change their position.”
Gamero added the organizers paired up with coalitions, such as the Mobilized African Diaspora, to protest the gentrification in West Harlem that stems from the University’s campus expansion plans.
“We understood that this strike can be a way to get Columbia to listen to their demands,” he said.
Willem Morris, a senior at Columbia and strike organizer, said he hopes the strike will be included in the “larger conversation” about the affordability of higher education.
“We really hope that this movement can be a part of a larger conversation about affordable education,” Morris said. “It’s really important to us that this conversation extends beyond the pandemic, because this problem isn't going away, even if the pandemic does.”
A Columbia University spokesperson wrote in an email to The Crimson that its leadership is attuned to student demands and understands the motivations behind the strike.
"This is a moment when an active reappraisal of the status quo is understandable, and we expect nothing less from our students,” the statement read. “Their voices are heard by Columbia's leadership, and their views on strengthening the University are welcomed."
Jeremy Dominguez, a student at Harvard Extension School, said the challenges students face during the pandemic warrant more recognition from the University in the form of lowering tuition rates.
“I definitely think Harvard has not done much at all to what they should be doing, what they're supposed to be doing,” Dominguez said. “A tuition strike is definitely overdue, long past overdue at Harvard at this point.”
Peer institutions like Princeton University, American University, and Georgetown University announced 10 percent tuition cuts for the 2020-2021 academic year, while Williams College cut its cost of attendance by 15 percent.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on whether or not Harvard would freeze or reduce tuition fees for the next academic year.
Since the pandemic began, Harvard’s administration has increased its support for financial aid programs. University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in the University’s Annual Financial Report published in October 2020 that the University increased funding for financial aid by $31 million in the past year.
In the same report, University Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister and Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75 wrote that Harvard’s financial position “remains strong” as a result of thorough financial planning, despite losing $10 million from operations due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“This sound financial management allowed the University to be in a position to cover sudden losses from operations, while also investing in the mission, for example, by granting $645 million in financial aid and scholarships to students,” the report read.
Without financial aid, tuition at the College stands at $49,653 for the 2020-2021 academic year and balloons to $72,391 with the addition of room, board, and fees.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At least 26 Harvard affiliates received positive Covid-19 test results between Jan. 25 and Feb. 5 — forcing at least some into isolation housing — that were later invalidated after the testing lab adjusted the threshold required to determine a positive result.
Two affected undergraduates told The Crimson that, after being moved into isolation rooms at the Harvard Square Hotel, they were initially refused additional testing despite suspecting that their tests were “false positives.”
Students living on campus self-administer three Covid-19 tests per week using kits designed by Color Genomics. The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard then processes the tests, allowing Color to notify students of their results, often within a day. If an undergraduate tests positive, they enter isolation and move to a University-designated location. Their close contacts must quarantine in their rooms at the direction of Harvard University Health Services.
The 26 affected tests came after the Broad Institute made an upgrade in late January which doubled their testing capacity and augmented the “robustness” of their testing assays, according to Broad Institute spokesperson Karen Zusi.
“After two weeks’ worth of data from the upgrade, working with the MA Department of Public Health, we adjusted the interpretation thresholds that we use to call a test ‘positive,’” Zusi wrote in an emailed statement. “This means that a small number of tests reported as ‘positive’ under the original interpretation framework between Jan 25th and Feb 5th have been updated to a different result (for example, ‘invalid,’ and moving forward, ‘inconclusive’).”
Since Covid polymerase chain reaction tests — known as PCR tests — can detect extremely low viral presence in an individual even when he or she is not infectious, this adjustment was made to prevent the tests from being too sensitive, HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry added in an emailed statement.
Color later informed the 26 affected affiliates that their tests were invalidated due to a “process error.” Zusi pointed out that “process error” is the standard language Color uses whenever a result is changed, and — in this case — it reflected the updated protocols for interpreting results, rather than an actual “error.”
Only 26 out of 37,000 tests run during this period were affected, Zusi added. All results reported before Jan. 25 and after Feb. 5 remain valid, as do negative results reported during this period, according to Perry.
Zusi explained that affiliates whose test results were deemed “invalid” are not necessarily negative for Covid.
“Re-collections were strongly recommended,” she wrote.
Luis F. Esteva Sueiro ’24 — one of the 26 Harvard affiliates affected — received a positive Covid-19 test result on Feb. 4 and was immediately instructed to quarantine for 10 days at the Harvard Square Hotel, according to emails Sueiro provided to The Crimson.
A few days into quarantine, however, he suspected the result might have been a “false positive" after his suitemate tested negative twice. Sueiro said he did not experience any Covid-19 symptoms, and no one he had been in contact with in the days prior tested positive.
After calling HUHS to ask for another test to confirm his results, Sueiro said he was “met with a lot of opposition.” He said he continued asking every day during HUHS phone check-ins and temperature checks, and his request was denied by staff around four times.
The one time Sueiro did make headway, HUHS put him in contact with a physician, who was also “pretty opposed to giving another test,” but agreed to administer an antibody test three weeks later to determine if Sueiro actually had the illness.
“I go through this 10-day quarantine, according to Harvard, I have antibodies and I’m good. But since I didn’t actually have it, I’m going to go out into the Harvard community, potentially get Covid a month from now, not be testing, and then walk around for 10 days spreading it without knowing,” he said. “That was my main concern.”
Students who recover from Covid-19 do not test again for 90 days, according to HUHS protocol.
On Feb. 8, Suiero received a new update from Color on his testing portal that stated “the previously reported result (DETECTED) is not valid due to a process error.” At the bottom of the notice was a recommendation that “this patient should be retested.” The next afternoon, Sueiro retested and received a negative result on Feb. 10.
He said he then called HUHS about leaving quarantine and was sent to voicemail a number of times before given approval to move out Wednesday evening.
Perry wrote that Color system results were changed before HUHS was informed of the 26 affected individuals.
Another student, whom The Crimson granted anonymity to discuss confidential medical information, also tested positive on Feb. 4 and received the same “process error” notice from Color four days into quarantine at the hotel. The student said they started to doubt the original positive test after the contact-tracing process revealed that no one they came into contact with contracted the virus, nor did their two suitemates.
The student was denied a re-test over the phone on the second day of their quarantine when they still had not experienced any symptoms. They asked again several days later when they received the updated inconclusive Color result, but were told that would not be possible. The day after, the student said, a nurse informed them that the isolation period would likely remain the same.
When another nurse eventually came to conduct a re-test, that nurse also informed the student the quarantine would likely not change, regardless of the test result, according to the student.
“Well, if nothing’s going to change, then why even test us in the first place?” the student said.
The student was given permission to move out Wednesday night.

In case you’ve been in nonstop Zooms for the past week, Datamatch is out, and there’s still time to sign up! For those of you unacquainted with Harvard’s best tradition, Datamatch is the exact intersection of two of everyone’s favorite things: personality quizzes and free food. In normal times, you would sign up, take a funky quiz, indicate if you’re looking for platonic or romantic matches (or both!), and then get matched with other Harvard students through a top-secret algorithm. If you and your matches both clicked “Match,” you could grab some free food in the Square with your date!
The “meet up for free food” side of things looks a bit different this year for obvious reasons, but Datamatch is still helping you land fun, free dates no matter where you are in the world. I had the pleasure of chatting with Isabelle S. Zheng ’22 and Bill W. Zhang ’21, the Supreme Cupids of Datamatch, to uncover how Datamatch is adapting to the new normal, the inspiration behind some of the new features, and relationship advice from the finest matchmakers on campus. Spoiler alert: Love is real, and Datamatch will help you find it. :-)
First things first, let’s talk about free stuff — remember the good ‘ol days when you used to get bribed to go to events with free food? Luckily, there’s perks for students on and off campus. Here’s what our Supreme Cupids have in store in terms of free dates:
For on-campus folks: 
You can expect the standard Datamatch treatment: free food with your top match at local partners in the square. “Thanks to Harvard moving to Level Yellow,” Zhang said, “we feel very comfortable allowing in-person dates to occur at our partner restaurants this year, which include Amorino, Black Sheep Bagel, [and] Kung Fu Tea. In past years we always run out of dates, because everyone wants to go on a date, but this year due to the limited student population on campus, we feel there’s a much better chance that everyone will get a chance to go on a date with their top matches.” Sounds like good news to us! Also, the on-campus options aren’t limited to students living on Harvard property, but are open to participants residing in Cambridge near campus as well.
For off-campus folks: 
If you’re not on campus right now, Datamatch has still got you covered. “For students who are not on campus, we have a new very exciting virtual escape room option that we paid for for all of our top matches, which is a really fun collaborative experience to have with the person you’re matched with,” Zhang said. Additionally, the Snackpass partnership extends to all cities that Snackpass serves, so you might still have a shot at free food in your hometown!
So, now that you know what’s in it for you, head on over to Datamatch and bask in the glory of its beautiful aesthetics (p.s., there’s definitely not a cute Easter egg if you spend enough time clicking around the landing page. No sir.). Datamatch, as always, has a fantastic quiz, but there’s new features this year, too. You can customize so many things about your profile, and even link your Spotify.
One especially helpful new feature is the addition of the Blocklist. Still mentally cringing over that time that you broke a plate in Annenberg in front of your crush? Just don’t want that asshole devil’s advocate from section in your matches? Enter their email into your Blocklist (you can still preemptively block them even if you don’t know if they’ve signed up), and the algorithm will make sure they aren’t in your matches.
If the gorgeous website and fun features haven’t convinced you to sign up yet, don’t worry. This year’s Datamatch is better than ever, thanks to a ~spicy~ new addition: the Crush Roulette feature. Crush Roulette allows each user to submit the emails of two people they think should get together, and the algorithm adjusts their chances of matching accordingly. Each user can only submit one pairing, though, so scheme wisely. Zhang and Zheng can explain the secrets of Crush Roulette better than I ever could, so I’ll let them take it from here.
ISZ: We were really trying to shake it up this year. We wanted to get more users more engaged and offer new things to play around with on the website, and one of our members came up with Crush Roulette. This was totally member-led; they designed the feature, they built the feature, they worked out all the kinks with it, so we’re really excited about it.
BWZ: As far as I can tell, it’s all my blockmates and my friends can talk about — who they’re gonna put, or asking around for which friend they can help ship. Empirically, it seems that things are really getting heated with Crush Roulette.
BWZ: The goal here, of course, is to allow people to feel like they have more control. We’re not going to go into any of the details of the algorithm, just because that’s some, uh, magic sauce. We will say, just to make sure people don’t have false hope, it’s not that if you just put [an email into Crush Roulette], that person becomes your number one, because that would be too easy. So, we do account for it in the algorithm, but it’s not the end-all be-all result.
BWZ: And that’s also necessary, because otherwise I could just put Isabelle and Isabelle could put me and we’ll just get our free food. So, we did wanna make sure that does not happen.
Welp, there goes our hope for gaming the system. Sigh.
PAJ: Is it like a laborious, intensive, multi-day process [to create the matches]?
ISZ: So usually, after the survey closes on February 14th, our algorithm team stays up all night to run the algorithm for all of the schools. So, it does take multiple hours to run, but I wouldn’t say it takes days.
BWZ: Yeah, at this point we’ve successfully discovered how to use computers, so it’s no longer like the laborious hand-matching process that I’m sure our predecessors, like, twenty-some years ago who started Datamatch had to use. But, it’s still something that requires a lot of attention, and you know, making sure that different users requests — whether it’s like the different preferences, or the Blocklist — are accounted for. So it is something that we pay a lot of attention to, to make sure we get it right.
ISZ: I will also personally add that our members have been working a lot on making the algorithm even better this year using anonymized data, trying to figure out what makes a match good. So, we’re continuously trying to improve those matches.
PAJ: So do you guys work kind of continuously on Datamatch since the start of the school til launch, essentially?
BWZ: It’s definitely becoming more and more a year-round endeavor, um, partly because as you can see a lot of these really cool features they take a lot of time to brainstorm, design, and also partly because we’ve sort of been introducing new variants of Datamatch. Last May, when everything became virtual, we tried, like, a quarantine Datamatch that was open to all students and they got put into a single pool. In the fall we now have a Meet program, called Meet24, for freshmen to platonically — platonically — get to know each other. And, in recent years, Datamatch also became the organization that conducts Match20 — or, this year it’ll be Match21 — which is for, like, the outgoing seniors to get, like, one last shot. So, as a result, there’s things going during, like, all parts of the year.
ISZ: I also wanted to add, just really quickly, that we’re trying to build a lot of education into Datamatch’s “comp”, quote-unquote, as well. One of our web leads put together this entire web bootcamp curriculum that ran over the summer, and again in the fall just to kind of teach everyone that goes through it a lot about web development and coding and getting them into the specifics and basics of Datamatch.
PAJ: So, like, anyone can join Datamatch? Even if you’re not computer-inclined?
BWZ and ISZ: Yes!
BWZ: Absolutely! We sort of paint ourselves as these CS nerds, who, like, come up with this algorithm, but there truly are a ton of other things to work on. In fact, if you look at, like, the credits page, you see the web team, the algo team — very typical, like, STEM-oriented teams — but the business team, the design team, all the other campus leads and campus members, what they work on day to day is a lot more operations-focused, a lot more creative — like writing the questions, reaching out to the businesses, establishing partnerships, finances. Our comp is completely open, there’s no interview, there’s no cutting. Our philosophy is: We want you to have fun doing it, and you will know at the end of it if you had fun. We give you responsibility wherever you want it, wherever you ask for it.
So, basically, Datamatch is one of the most wholesome groups on campus (almost on the level of a certain blog run by a certain newspaper). Not all that surprising, given that love and connection is kind of their deal.
PAJ: Since you guys happen to know everything about love, any advice for Datamatch hopefuls? Any pro tips from the people behind the machine?
ISZ: Oh yes, yes! I actually worked on a project after Datamatch last year that just collected anonymous survey data from a bunch of the users on Datamatch, and just wanted to provide a report and cool data visualizations of what dating’s like at schools around the country. So, one of the stats we found was that Datamatch users who actually go on a date with their Datamatch were actually 30 percent more likely to be in a relationship in college. So, I think the message in that is just, keep your mind open, match all of the Datamatches you get, and just, like, see what comes out of it. Having that practice in being open-minded means that you might be open-minded to other things in the world as well.
BWZ: Yeah, and like reinforcing that message of being open, we definitely also saw that Datamatch users who have profile pictures, filled out their bio, just provided more information about themselves, were more open to their potential matches — they got matched more often, went on dates more often. And so, that’s also sort of similar to Isabelle’s message: be comfortable, be open; don’t be shy, don’t be skeptical. Everyone on the website is a fellow Harvard student, right? Nobody else is gonna see you that you don’t want to see you and you have the Blocklist, so really be open and try to form new connections. And, if you have that mindset, then people will come to you.
Bruh. That’s some cute shit. This is the most emotion I’ve felt since last year. Honestly, love might be real, y’all. 
PAJ: Just one last question: If you had to describe your love life as a HUDS dish, anything come to mind?
ISZ and BWZ: [silence]
BWZ: Oh man.
BWZ: I would say my love life is like the Red Spiced Chicken. On the outside, it’s like people always think that things are going on, but no. On the inside it’s just plain chicken. Like, it’s just the most normal, ordinary thing.
ISZ: I’m just, like, very fond of, like, the biscuits and honey butter. I can’t exactly describe why I wanna tie that to my relationship status or whatever, but it’s just, like, you know, a little bit salty and sweet, and it has that nice honey flavor. The textures are great. Just like a nice, I don’t know — I don’t think that really applies. [laughs] I don’t know.
BWZ: What about you?
PAJ: Oh, jeez, I dunno. I should’ve prepared an answer to this! [silence] I guess, kind of like ordering something from the grill because it takes a long time, and by the time you get it you don’t really want it anymore. [awkward laugh]
PAJ: So, any closing thoughts for our readers?
BWZ: One last message I wanna leave is just that Datamatch, we’re always trying to bring love to more people. Um, this year, I think we’re doing a little too well. There’s other schools on our tails in terms of signing up. A message to Harvard students: please sign up, we can’t lose to other schools!
ISZ: Particularly, WashU!
BWZ: We have to keep our Harvard dominance in Datamatch!
At the time of publishing, UW Madison is somehow beating Harvard by nearly 900 sign-up’s… y’all. This is just sad. Go! Sign! Up!
If you’re not convinced by now, maybe you just hate love. Just kidding. Kind of. But, seriously: Sign up, get your free food, and find the platonic or romantic love of your life! Happy matching!
Xoxo,
Flyby
