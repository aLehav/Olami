After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the universe of cinematic drummers, Ruben Stone, the heavy metal drummer in Darius Mauder’s “Sound of Metal,” is a classic Andrew Nieman. In short, he's a case study of how dedication, obsession and perfection come at the expense of mental — and often, physical — health.
Mauder's film follows Ruben (Riz Ahmed), a drummer in a touring metal duo with his girlfriend Lou (Olivia Cooke), as he loses his hearing and consequently, the rocker life he was accustomed to. From the moment of his diagnosis, Ruben refuses to listen to medical professionals who advise him to stop drumming in live shows. This sets up the main conflict: Ruben’s struggles with addiction and perilous relationship with Lou. After entering a deaf rehabilitation house, Ruben seems to connect with the welcoming lifestyle of the community, and even shares his own talent for drumming.
Joe (Paul Raci), the host at the rehabilitation house, serves as the beating emotional heart of the film — in large part due to Raci's honest and candid performance. Joe is a welcome antidote to Ruben’s frustration and stubbornness: When Ruben falters, Joe remains a patient teacher.
Mauder also takes critical steps to avoid falling into deaf stereotypes, even casting deaf actors to play deaf characters, which heightens the film’s realism and provides much-needed representation. This includes Jenn (Chelsea Lee) who is, as all deaf characters are in the film, a complex, nuanced character.
Another standout is the film's expert sound design — which takes centerstage from the loud, powerful opening scene to the serene silence in the final scene. Mauder's deliberate choices with sound design vivifies Ruben’s very relationship with sound, and allows sound itself to serve as a storytelling mechanism. For instance, as Ruben’s hearing deteriorates, the film makes a pointed effort to distort or altogether mute sound in key shots.
Ruben’s experience in the deaf community, too, is refreshing in a film largely driven by Ruben’s anger and desperation. The wide, lingering shots in the idyllic deaf community stand in sharp contrast to the dark concert scenes where Ruben drums with animalistic fervor to the tune of a shaky camera. It's a contrast as pointed as Ruben's transformation over the course of the film — from initially abrasive to compassionate.
Though the majority of the film is enjoyable, the problem in “Sound of Metal” lies in its ending. When the credits roll, audiences find that Mauder has done little to resolve the tensions between Ruben, Lou, and the deaf community. One is simply left to accept that the central conflicts have been wrapped up in a matter of minutes — with very little to show for it.
For instance, Mauder resolves one plot line by finally allowing Ruben to find peace and stillness. This is the peace that Joe had been pushing Ruben to seek throughout the film, but despite a dramatic build up, the conclusion seems fraught. Throughout "Sound of Metal," Mauder had focused squarely on how Ruben’s abrasive, impulsive personality affected his relationships with others, so to allow Ruben to find peace without atonement leaves the film feeling unfinished.
“Sound of Metal” is an ambitious directorial effort, but perhaps Mauder took on too much. The experience of addiction, of loss, of growth, of adaptation — all of which initially set themselves up at the crux of the story — are tragically underplayed by the film’s conclusion. For music lovers, “Sound of Metal” is still a worthwhile film to watch; the energetic concert scenes are enough of a draw in and of themselves. Anyone who watches, however, will also have to contend with a story that tries to do a lot but achieves too little.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 18, 2020 at 12:08 a.m.
University Professor and potential 2022 gubernatorial candidate Danielle S. Allen said she would apply decades of experience in academia to her foray into politics in an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday.
Allen announced on Twitter Monday she is exploring a potential Democratic candidacy for Massachusetts governor in 2022. She also officially filed as a potential candidate with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, making her the second Democratic candidate to publicly explore a 2022 gubernatorial bid.
At Harvard, Allen’s academic work has focused on democratic theory and the history of political thought. Allen — who holds Ph.D.s in classics and in political science — said her academic interests have provided her with a “long historical perspective” valuable to public office.
“A historical perspective is always useful in any human endeavor,” she said. “It helps you see how hard change is, how durable communities are, and how resilient they are.”
Allen said she thought about entering politics as a result of three pivotal moments over the past decade, including her family member’s experience with mass incarceration.
“In 2009, I lost a beloved baby cousin,” Allen said. “He had been arrested when he was 15, served about 12 years, and then was killed two years after his first release by somebody he had met in prison.”
Allen also pointed to the 2016 presidential election and the onset of the coronavirus pandemic this March as further reasons she decided to explore entering the political sphere.
“The erosion of democratic norms since [2016] has felt profoundly painful, and I have felt a need to help reverse that and model an alternative in the public sphere: real commitment to core democratic norms including trustworthiness and truthfulness,” Allen said.
As director of Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, Allen helped author the Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience, a comprehensive policy guide published in April that promotes the use of testing, tracing, and supported isolation to combat the coronavirus pandemic.
“I just could see real opportunity, real potential to do so much better in terms of how we invest in our health infrastructure," she said.
While Monday’s announcement marks Allen’s first step toward a potential run for governor, Allen said she previously took time off from academia to serve as a regional field organizer for the 2008 Obama campaign. If she were to commit to running, Allen said she plans to take leave from the University.
Allen said that she has always “straddled the lines” between academia and public service – a balance she said she would hope to continue as governor.
“I’ve always merged the two activities,” Allen said. “I have been really fortunate to be able to build on my scholarly track record to collaborate with and contribute to policy-making and legislation.”
Allen also said the skills she has gained as a scholar would be beneficial to addressing public policy issues in Massachusetts as governor.
“Any healthy democracy depends on an ability to bring together big networks of folks with expertise and also connect that to on-the-ground community conversations — where people set their own goals and objectives — and to try to weave those two things together,” she said.
Allen said she will continue in her full-time role at Harvard while she conducts a listening tour to scope out Massachusetts residents’ concerns over the next three months.
“It’s really important to assemble all the best ideas that people around the state are putting forward and really build on the efforts that are underway — asking the question of how can state government really help scale up and bring impact for ideas that are already working,” Allen said.
Allen has already begun assembling a campaign team, courting Reynolds D. Graves, who was a vice president at political communications firm SKDKnickerbocker, as campaign manager. Harvard Business School professor emeritus Malcolm S. Salter ’62 will be her campaign chairman, according to the campaign filing.
Graves previously served as an aide to former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston city councilor Tito Jackson, according to the Boston Globe.
Allen enters into a sparse field of declared candidates for the governor’s seat. Scott M. Khourie — a Democrat from Quincy — officially announced his committee on Dec. 11, while Carlos D. Perez — a Libertarian from Springfield — filed on Nov. 4.
Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 has not yet announced a run for a third consecutive term in office. Baker, a two-term incumbent Republican, has remained popular in the state, earning the title of most popular governor in the United States for a span of more than two years.
Still, Allen said she believes she could bring a different perspective to the corner office at the State Capitol.
“Every democracy is healthiest when it has competitive elections, so I believe there’s room for a new voice,” Allen said.
“I believe I add a distinctive voice,” she added.
CORRECTION: December 18, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Boston Globe reported former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston city councilor Tito Jackson were serving on Allen's campaign team. In fact, the Globe article has been updated to clarify that Patrick and Jackson are former employers of Allen's campaign manager, Reynolds D. Graves, and are not on Allen's team.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Academic continuity was a guiding principle in Harvard’s planning for the spring semester, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Monday interview.
Harvard’s plan for the spring semester — announced earlier this month by Khurana, along with University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay — welcomes roughly half of all undergraduates to live on campus. The plan gives preference to seniors, currently enrolled juniors, and students faced with learning environment or time zone challenges.
This past semester, the College hosted just a quarter of students — primarily first-years — in its dorms. Khurana said the success of the fall opened the door to bringing even more students back this spring.
“Our campus was able to maintain a Covid-19 positivity rate that was below that of the surrounding Greater Boston and Cambridge communities and we did not find any evidence of transmission among members of our undergraduate residential population that was on campus,” Khurana said. “This encouraged our outcomes and our decision-making.”
When deciding which students to invite to campus, Khurana said administrators prioritized academic continuity.
“We made a commitment that if we were going to have any type of students, it would be students who couldn’t do their academic work at home,” he said. “So students who didn’t have the conditions to advance on their academic work or needed to be on campus to do their academic work.”
Khurana said the groups the University chose to prioritize bringing back to campus have particular academic needs that can only be met on Harvard's campus.
“Seniors have projects that range from a thesis to capstone projects,” he said, citing endeavors that require access to Harvard’s libraries and other academic resources located on campus.
He added that the second semester of junior year is also a crucial “jumping off point for independent research.”
Khurana said that the College prioritized juniors who completed the fall not only because of their second-semester research needs, but also because it sought to maintain consistency with its earlier messaging that students who took a leave of absence would not be guaranteed on-campus housing upon their return.
Though they will not be prioritized, juniors returning from a leave of absence are still eligible to apply for spring on-campus housing and will be “accommodated to the greatest degree possible,” according to the University’s spring plan.
Khurana acknowledged the spring housing decision shuts the sophomore class out of living on campus for the entire academic year.
“This is also a difficult decision because we knew how challenging it would also be for sophomores who were confronting the reality of being away from campus for a full year, which is really, really difficult,” he said.
Some sophomores — in addition to first-year students and juniors returning from a leave of absence — told The Crimson they were disappointed with the spring plans shortly after the University’s announcement.
“I know that the decision is not the optimal decision,” Khurana said. “Our ultimate goal is to bring all students back to campus.”
