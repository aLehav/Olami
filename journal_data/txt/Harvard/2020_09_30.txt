She’s done it again, folks. Lady Gaga dropped the video we’ve all been waiting for. The music video (or, per Gaga, “short film”) for “911” has landed.
Since the release of Gaga’s sixth studio album “Chromatica,” fans have been going crazy for the track "911,” especially in conjunction with the seamless transition from the instrumental interlude that precedes it, “Chromatica II.” Gaga revealed that the album’s third single is about her use of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, which helps her combat self-destructive behaviors. The short film, set to both “Chromatica II” and “911,” reflects not only her need for medication but also the importance of receiving support from others.
Laden with surreal imagery and heavily influenced by Armenian filmmaker Sergei Parajanov’s “The Colour of Pomegranates,” the video begins with Gaga standing in the midst of a Spanish mission as an uncanny depiction of life jerks around her. A man smashes his head into a pillow on the ground, a woman cradles a mummy, and two figures — a woman in a white gown and miter and a scantily clad man in black — follow her throughout the film, keeping her grounded every time she tries to leave. At one point, adorned in postmodern halo headgear, Gaga ascends to what appears to be heaven. But the woman in white and the man in black refuse to let her go, lassoing her back down to earth.
As the film seems to reach a fever pitch, with pictograms of a car accident flashing across the screen and Gaga screaming in front of a spinal board while the nameless characters of the film all point at her, the man in black plunges two daggers into Gaga’s chest, shocking her back to reality.
Once she awakes, her clarity returns, and we see that she was a part of that previously depicted car accident. The seemingly incomprehensible pieces of the puzzle come together: the woman in white and the man in black are paramedics, the Western Asian influences are derived from an Armenian Film Festival sign, and the mission setting comes from an advertisement for White Sands National Park in New Mexico. More and more of the video’s surreal elements begin to fall in line with their parallel reality. Gaga cries to the paramedics, “I don’t want to die,” but they were there the whole time, ensuring that she would never slip away.
In an Instagram post about the release of the short film, Gaga wrote: “Reality and dreams can interconnect to form heroes within us and all around us.” While Gaga could have ascended to heaven, the paramedics followed her throughout the vision and brought her back to life when her grasp on reality was slipping away. The dark lyric “My biggest enemy is me / Pop a 911” speaks to the difficulty of finding a way to survive in those moments when the body can no longer help itself. The surreal imagery and movement throughout the short film reflect a deeper emphasis not just of the will to live, but of the necessity of receiving help from others when you need it. Survival even against one’s internal struggles is only possible through a network of caring heroes.

How do you get over a breakup?
If you’re a lesbian, you’ll probably make a piece of art with your ex. Artistic collaboration between queer women who’ve broken up is no rare phenomenon –– take the 2019 film “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” written and directed by Céline Sciamma and starring her longtime ex-lover Adèle Haenel, or the intimate music video for The Japanese House’s “Lilo”, featuring lead singer Amber Bain and her ex Marika Hackman. Hackman, herself a musician, said: “It was never nasty between me and Amber. We’re still best mates. We hang out a lot. It’s what lesbians do by the way.”
This rule holds true yet again in Cari Fletcher (better known as FLETCHER)’s latest album “THE S(EX) TAPES,” a glittering synthpop chronicle of a past but lingering relationship. All of the seven music videos were shot and directed by Shannon Beveridge, high-profile queer YouTuber and (you guessed it!) Fletcher’s ex.
“THE S(EX) TAPES” is a brash about-face from Fletcher’s previous album, “you ruined new york city for me,” a much softer sort of break-up pop. Here, those plucky electric guitars and faded synths get a glossy makeover. The message is clear –– this one is meant to be danced to.
In that sense the album certainly succeeds. Fletcher can write a hook as well as anyone in the business. Add in a few collaborations with high-profile songwriters, including the songwriting team behind Dua Lipa’s biggest hits and Jennifer Decilveo, who has written for everyone from Machine Gun Kelly to Ben Platt, and you have a sexy-pop-break-up sensation in the works.
The highlights: “Shh…Don’t Say It” and “If I Hated You” both epitomize the sad-yet-danceable genre in which Fletcher excels. The toned-down “Bitter,” co-written with Kito, is the angry ache of a blister rubbed raw. “I know you fucked her on the counter right before you cooked her dinner,” Fletcher sings, through her teeth. It’s a knockout line, even more so considering her subject is right there on the other side of the lens.
And that brings us to the music videos. Here’s where the vapid, surface-level reputation that defines today’s pop music catches up to Fletcher. Each of the videos brims with that trademark pop sex appeal which, although it’s less commodified for Fletcher than for, say, Justin Bieber or Ariana Grande, still rings with falsehood. Even while stumbling into the foamy grey sea in “Silence,” Fletcher maintains her perfect makeup, her too-cool model’s slouch, and her air of studied nonchalance. Many of the videos are nothing more than a Calvin Klein photoshoot, shuffling too quickly between generic pop shots of lips-eyes-skin with very little substance behind them. The videography is beautiful, but it’s so concerned with the physicality of intimacy that it forgets the emotion behind it.
There is one exception to that rule. Ironically, “Sex (With My Ex)” is the most explicitly narrative, and perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable, of the seven songs. The music video is a black-and-white compilation of shaky intimate shots, most of them handheld and casual, pulled from social media and an extensive camera roll. It’s the only time we really see Beveridge in front of the camera, and the effect is startling. The monologue becomes a conversation. There is a new kind of intimacy. For just a moment, we are privy to the golden days.
At the very end of the music video for “Sex (With My Ex),” we see Beveridge and Fletcher, together one last time. “Quarantine’s ending,” Fletcher says, her eyes drifting just below the frame. Then a quick cut and she’s looking right in the lens, her gaze sultry and sad. “Goodbye forever.” It’s a stripped-down moment, a sharp counterpoint to the staged glamour of the last six songs. If only it had lasted a little longer.

It’s loud. It’s haunting. And it’s unmistakably Almodóvar. Academy Award winning Spanish writer-director Pedro Almodóvar, known for “Talk to Her” and “Pain and Glory”, leaves his trademark stylistic stamp on his English-language debut “The Human Voice.” Almodóvar's latest is a timely story about grief and the importance of human connection, which also comments on the role that film can play in facilitating such connection.
“The Human Voice” is a short film about an unnamed woman (Tilda Swinton in a powerful, emotionally resonant role) who struggles in the aftermath of a four year relationship that ends unceremoniously. It opens with the woman taking a trip to a hardware store, where she purchases an axe from a very concerned-looking salesman and uses it to slash at her partner's suit laying dormant on a bed. Some time passes before her former partner calls and she talks to him with audio only; we only ever hear her side of the conversation. Soon, the woman walks out of her apartment, and it’s revealed that her apartment exists within a film stage.
It seems to have been a priority for Almodóvar to work with some of his frequent collaborators in "The Human Voice". Here, he pairs again with cinematographer José Luis Alcaine, from “Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown” in 1988 to “Pain and Glory” in 2019, and production designer Antxon Gómez, who worked on “All About My Mother” and “Pain and Glory.” Even the score, by Alberto Iglesias — who has composed the scores in all of Almodóvar’s films — revisits musical motifs from the director's filmography, including themes from “Talk to Her.”
But Almodóvar doesn't reunite with these craftsmen for the pure sake of nostalgia; “The Human Voice” is special because it exhibits an uncanny self-awareness. Almodóvar’s latest looks past the acclaimed director’s filmography and highlights his key themes of loneliness, regret, and the importance of human connection, all while shining a light on the parallels between filmic constructions and everyday reality.
On a visual level, Alcaine injects an absurdist quality into “The Human Voice.” His camera work is particularly striking in the opening scenes, for instance with a dolly zoom as the woman looks, distraught and disoriented, over the terrace, or with a creeping tracking shot of her legs as she approaches the bed with an axe. Alcaine’s hyper-saturated palette of scintillating reds and pronounced greens represents the heightened reality of a filmic presentation. Evidently, this was Almodóvar’s intention. Alcaine sometimes shoots from overhead to reveal the apartment set in its entirety, illuminating all the dividing walls.
These shots work in large part thanks to the ingenious production design from Antxon Gómez. He dresses up the house interior like a typical Almodóvar film, complete with the same palette and even identical decorations — some rooms might as well have been pulled straight out of “Pain and Glory."
There is no doubt that this is an artificial, constructed reality. But it’s also one where Swinton’s character is walled in, not only in reality as an actor bound to the set, but as a character stuck in the shell of a relationship that no longer exists. It’s a puzzling development that could leave multiple interpretations; however, it’s most likely that Almodóvar is pointing to how film, as a constructed reality itself, is used to communicate and connect with the audience. When that connection breaks down, all that’s left is the theatrics — a flamboyant, and as Swinton’s character proves, a highly flammable, set.
Almodóvar’s film was set to begin shooting in April 2020, but due to COVID-19, production instead began in July. As most of the world remains in some form of lockdown, "The Human Voice" finds itself screening virtually at the New York Film Festival. It’s prescient that a film about the importance of human connection should be interrupted by a pandemic that strained the very definition of those connections.
“The Human Voice” may well be one of the premier highlights of NYFF, and serves as a reminder that Almodóvar remains a filmmaking force — even with a career now entering its fifth decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At long last, after a six year absence from the silver screen, David Fincher returns to the director’s chair with his widely anticipated film “Mank.” Fincher’s celebrated filmography spans masterpieces like “Fight Club,” “Seven,” and “The Social Network.” In "Mank," Fincher brings back much of his ensemble crew, including production designer Donald Graham Burt, editor Kirk Baxtor, and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross — so expect his signature style and power in his latest film.
Fincher’s pronounced absence from the big screen isn’t the only streak that will end with "Mank"'s release. “Mank” itself has toiled in production hell for over 20 years. Since Fincher’s now-late father Howard “Jack” Fincher drafted its screenplay, multiple studios have picked up, stalled, and dropped “Mank” from their production cycles. Fincher's insistence on shooting in black and white was a key contributing factor for this purgatory. However, Fincher's luck turned following the critical success of Alfonso Cuarón's black and white Netflix-produced “Roma.” The streaming giant later found confidence in greenlighting ambitious films from auteurs, including Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman," Noah Baumbach's "Marriage Story," and most recently, Fincher's "Mank."
In spite of the go-ahead, Fincher can’t seem to catch a break from controversy. At one point in the film's production, he even considered casting Kevin Spacey in the lead role. From tackling Facebook with all its ethical dilemmas of privacy rights to disowning a critically divisive "Aliens 3" to incorporating gratuitous gore in "Seven," Fincher has walked a fine line treading between both sides sensitive issues in the film world. "Mank" is no different: It captures the heated half-century debate over which screenwriter of Orson Welles' debut masterpiece "Citizen Kane" deserves primary credit — the titular Herman “Mank” J. Mankiewicz or the boy-wonder director Orson Welles himself.
In 1971, through two consecutive issues of the New Yorker, film critic Pauline Kael published “Raising Kane.” The 50,000-word essay explored the creation of "Citizen Kane"'s screenplay, and praised Mankiewicz as the script’s mastermind while criticizing Welles for his meager contributions. Mainstream press welcomed Kael's article, but many critics — with Welles's close friend Peter Bogdanovich at their helm — fought against Kael's assertions. Bogdanovich cited a lack of evidence, and pointed to how Kael herself stole credit from UCLA faculty Howard Suber. Kael’s essay turned out to be heavily influenced by Mankiewicz’s own friend John Houseman. Both narratives were hotly contested, yet it was team Welles that came out on top — where it remains today. When “Mank” finally releases, viewers will see Fincher’s perspective first-hand, and the controversy will inevitably be revived once more.
"Mank" marks the first film where Fincher serves as both director and producer. The film comprises a star-studded lineup with Gary Oldman as Mankiewicz himself, Tom Burke as Welles, and Amanda Seyfried and Lily Collins as Marion Davies and Rita Alexander. Co-producer Eric Roth — who wrote “Forrest Gump” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” the latter of which Fincher directed — will imbue his own quirks and humorous style.
Although Fincher has shrouded many details about his film in secrecy, he has also proven that he knows how to handle a biopic. In “The Social Network,” Fincher depicted the creation of Facebook through the eyes of its founders Mark Zuckerberg and Eduardo Saverin. An audio-visual masterpiece, the 2010 film related the universal experiences of triumph and emptiness, and brought the start-up craze to mainstream culture. Ten years later, Fincher’s “Mank” gives the director another chance to showcase his abilities in classic Fincher fashion: by affecting millions from behind the camera. When it is finally released, all eyes will be on “Mank.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Breonna Taylor was an emergency medical technician. Every shift she leased her breath to restore life into strangers’ lungs, but no one came to her rescue for 20 minutes after three officers sent five bullets into her body and left her family with one less daughter. Black families across the country cry familiar and familial tears for another Black life lost. Cities burn in Breonna’s honor to caution racist institutions of their looming fate and Black women apply pressure to society's chest, trying desperately to resuscitate justice for one of our own.
Black women do not hesitate to provoke chaos because we have never known peace. Slave masters forced their wretchedness into our wombs and denied our femininity. Real women were made to be loved, so white men told the world to screw us. Our ingenuity is discounted and upcycled for white women to make chic. Somehow we still find space for joy and laughter despite being the punchline to every adolescent Black boy's joke. When those young men call on us to protect them, our answers too often go unrequited. Our humiliation, exploitation, and death is always a prerequisite as America pursues her degree in progress.
Political scientists mutated Breonna Taylor’s death into an antibiotic ointment to treat the nation’s wounds and gave corporate witch-doctors and white-guilt-driven healers instructions to apply each dose of the drug liberally. Black women outline our condition to legislative physicians and request preventative care, but instead, for our cries of pain we are prescribed indifference and malpractice.
Designers fashioned Breonna Taylor’s death into an accessory to accent the costumes that celebrity pacifists, masquerading as activists, don for their performances. Black grief was commodified into hoodies, tee shirts, and masks, and its price included neither shipping nor intentional handling. Her family watches “socially conscious” businesses build prosperity off their bereavement and waits to collect residuals that will never come.
Influencers memed Breonna Taylor’s death, transforming a woman into a mascot. Her name punctuated every Instagram caption, and “arrest the killers of Breonna Taylor” became a jingle before it ever had the chance to triumph as a rallying cry. Newly enlightened and self-proclaimed allies bark her name until it loses its bite and Black women are reminded we can trust no one to take our lives seriously but ourselves.
White America does not even bother to ask for forgiveness; they got so busy manipulating Breonna Taylor’s movement that they forget their obligation to produce her justice.
But the day after National Voter Registration Day, the only thing found guilty for Breonna’s murder was her Blackness, and the summer’s ensemble composed of blackout squares and vocalists who belted “I’ll never understand, but I stand,” stood silent. Their white noise was replaced by a harmony of neoliberal democrats and campus political challenges begging the Black community to vote. Their pleas are so loud that they muffle the demands of the Black women still demonstrating in the streets. It seems we are the only ones still singing the song for our liberation. The police abolition our chorus calls for knows no home in either party, and paper ballots are not durable shields against bullets that never cease fire, generation after generation. They urge us to dampen our protests and pour into the polls, confirming no one is listening.
After long days fighting to preserve our existence, Black minds are offered no recess. The grand jury’s decision not to seek justice for Breonna Taylor weighed so heavily that it should have been the elephant in every Zoom room, but instead, it went unaddressed by the same institutions who vowed to promote anti-racism. Professors and preceptors pile problems sets and essays onto their Black students’ heartbreak and require our full participation because a Black woman’s funeral is not an excused absence.
When a Black woman dies, white America does not cry, and Harvard does not send its condolences.

“If you are a talented musician and dedicated scholar, choosing between in-depth music training and a liberal arts education can be a tough decision.” – Harvard College promotional material
It’s a rare admission of weakness: one from Harvard that acknowledges its academic music department’s inability to provide a strong education in music performance. Its two dual degree music programs — with the New England Conservatory and Berklee College of Music — are born out of that concession, created to siphon prospective students away from both universities with attractive music schools (like Yale and Northwestern) and prestigious standalone conservatories (like the Cleveland Institute of Music or the Juilliard School). Such schools traditionally offer educations in classical and jazz performance, and sometimes also theater and dance. Conservatories’ singular focus makes them ideal for the the most dedicated students, the ones who dream of a successful career in the performing arts. And that’s why Harvard partners with them.
But in a world where few are able to make a living in a full-time orchestra or opera company, what exactly should conservatories be teaching? One study calculated that there are only 57 full-time orchestras in the United States, each with infrequent job openings, and more than 8,000 music school graduates every year: a sobering statistic for orchestra hopefuls. In contrast to the broad B.A. and B.S. degrees, the B.M. in Performance is a curriculum with a specific career path in mind. If orchestra jobs are dwindling, what does holding this degree mean?
To pursue a career in music, theater, or dance — activities that for most, remain hobbies— is bold. The dilemma orchestral musicians face after graduation combines the plight of the English major with that of the professional athletics hopeful. Like many humanities fields, jobs are few and far between, and most who enter the profession sign away their hopes of riches (the very best orchestral principals only make a modest six-figure salary). Getting that job, however, doesn’t involve an interview. Like the first day of training camp for a newly drafted rookie, all that is required is peak physical and mental performance on the day of the audition. Likewise, depending on the physical demands of their craft, some might have a shorter career than an injury-prone running back. In this way, students are gambling at a high stakes table — a loss can be devastating — and success is far from guaranteed.
Even before March, the classical music industry was routinely discovering new nadirs, as conservatory graduates nationwide fought each other for increasingly few orchestra positions. As a result, more and more of the college curriculum seems to be focused on “teaching to the test,” or emphasizing audition preparations at the expense of performance experience. One walking down a practice room hallway would hear audition excerpts for various orchestral instruments saturate the air: the oboe solo from Ravel’s “Le Tombeau de Couperin” here, the trumpet solo from Stravinsky’s “Petrushka” there, as students drill the few measures of music that might eventually decide whether they can afford a mortgage payment or not.
Auditions are serious business — they’re an intimidating, nerve-wracking, high pressure gauntlet. But the only thing worse than taking auditions is having no auditions at all. Due to the pandemic, this year has seen the cancellation of most orchestra seasons, along with the auditions for positions in them. For the time being, few orchestras are in any position to hire a new member, as they struggle to pay even their current members any salary.
Instead, we’re faced with a challenge and an opportunity: to adapt the classical music career to the times and teach our students accordingly. As solo and chamber music become the only opportunities for live performance, given their smaller size, swapping out some orchestral studies to focus on this repertoire may prove wise. Moreover, while audition excerpts will likely still remain relevant, they are unsuitable for performance on their own. Many students learn rigorous solo music only to satisfy their graduation recital requirement. But if social distancing is here to stay, a musician who wants to perform must adjust their focus accordingly.
Further, the ability to self-produce professional quality recordings is now becoming a necessity for all musicians. As many live performances may be permanently replaced by recordings, a working knowledge of the current recording technology is going to be important for any musician’s career. But the basic nuances of audio engineering, like the types of microphones, their optimal placements, and video editing skills, are relegated to far corners of schools’ course offerings, where students infrequently take advantage of them. There are countless other competencies that are required of modern musicians that could create a more whole degree-holder, not just an audition-taking automaton.
Of course, it’s difficult to turn a curriculum on a dime, but as the pandemic’s sojourn continues to overstay its welcome, these new skill requirements will be here for the foreseeable future. Harvard added its dual degree program with Berklee in 2016 and redesigned its music department’s curriculum to create more flexibility in 2017. Continuing on this path of self-reflection and expansion is crucial. Music was already hard enough. If there’s a time for colleges — both liberal arts institutions and conservatories — to support their music students with new course offerings and career preparation for a changing music industry, it’s now.

Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 — the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean for Administration and Finance — will retire next spring, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced in an email to faculty and staff Tuesday afternoon.
Kirwan’s accomplishments are “considerable and wide-ranging,” Gay wrote. After being recruited in 2009 to oversee all FAS administrative functions, she helped guide FAS out of a massive deficit following the 2008 financial crisis, balancing the budget by 2012 and eventually guiding the school to a $13.6 million surplus in 2019.
While maintaining the size of the faculty, Kirwan enabled the expansion of the financial aid program and the renovation of more than 800,000 square feet of space in the undergraduate residential Houses, according to Gay.
More recently, she led the FAS’s fiscal response to another economic downturn — the pandemic-induced recession, which led to more than $30 million in losses for the FAS alone.
“Now, as the FAS confronts the unprecedented challenges of the global pandemic, we do so with the benefit of Leslie’s wisdom and experience, of the strong teams she has built, and of a community that knows how to work together on hard problems in the face of considerable uncertainty,” Gay wrote. “And even as the Zoom calls stretch from early morning to late at night, Leslie’s warmth and humor, her dedication to her team and to the success of our academic community continue to lift me up when I feel my own energy flagging.”
Kirwan also restructured the FAS’s academic and budget planning. She implemented multi-year financial planning, introduced Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to the FAS, and initiated comprehensive annual public reports of the FAS financial decision. She also helped build the integrated model of Harvard University Information Technology, according to Gay.
Before joining the FAS, Kirwan served as finance director of the Massachusetts Port Authority, helping to lead the agency through a massive drop in revenues following the September 11 attacks. She came to Harvard from a position serving as the State of Massachusetts’ Secretary of Administration and Finance under Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, the first woman to serve in that position.
Often most visible to Harvard College students and FAS affiliates through her weather advisory emails, she would periodically announced that “FAS is currently expected to be open, with all events held as scheduled.”
Gay congratulated Kirwan for the “proud legacy” she will leave at Harvard.
“We have each been drawn to Harvard to participate in its enduring mission, one that betters the world by championing truth, advancing knowledge, and deepening our understanding of what it means to be human,” Gay wrote. “Dean Kirwan personifies this deep institutional commitment and fearless stewardship in service of our enduring mission.”
The FAS will launch an “international” search for Kirwan’s successor this fall, Gay wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Attorneys and activists squared off in state court Tuesday over Harvard’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign over University investments.
In oral arguments in front of Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Judge Christopher K. Barry-Smith ’88, the parties sparred over whether the suit against the University — similar to one filed by fossil-fuel divestment activists dismissed in 2014 — will proceed to trial.
The lawsuit, filed in February, accuses the University of two violations of Massachusetts law.
The first count alleges that Harvard violated its fiduciary duty and the Harvard Charter — a 1650 document that deemed the Harvard Corporation responsible for the University’s finances — by refusing to investigate the scope of its investments in the prison industry.
The second count accuses the University of “untrue and misleading advertising” based on Harvard’s promises to reckon with its historical ties to slavery, even as it maintains investments in prisons.
Harvard and HPDC have long disagreed about how much money the University invests in the prison industry. Harvard argued at the time that its investments totalled only $18,000, a drop in the bucket relative to the University’s then-$40.9 billion endowment. However, HPDC has argued that the number is closer to $3 million, counting indirect investments.
Amanda T. Chan and Anna L. Nathanson, both of whom graduated from Harvard Law School in May, and the other plaintiffs — Ismail A. Buffins, a graduate of the Divinity School, and Jarrett Drake and Citlalli Alvarez Almendariz, doctoral students in Anthropology — are appearing pro se in the suit.
Martin F. Murphy, a partner at Foley Hoag LLP, argued on behalf of Harvard for its motion to dismiss the suit.
In attempting to combat the charge of fiduciary violation, Murphy focused his attacks on the plaintiff’s standing to sue. Murphy argued that there are no “meaningful legal distinctions” between this lawsuit and a 2014 lawsuit that also alleged a violation of the Harvard Charter. That lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, with the judge finding that student plaintiffs had no stake in the endowment and lacked standing.
To differentiate the current suit from the failed 2014 attempt, all of the plaintiffs donated to the University, which they say gives them a stake in the University’s finances.
Murphy disagreed, citing legal precedent in Massachusetts that found that donors lacked the ability to sue the charities to which they donated.
He also noted that allowing small groups donors to dictate how the University spends its endowment when there is a “high likelihood” of donors with differing opinions would lead to “absurd results.”
Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General Emily Gabrault — who appeared on behalf of the state’s Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92, also named as a defendant in the suit, as is required in matters involving charities — backed the University’s position and its motion to dismiss.
Gabrault said in court on Tuesday that under state law, “donors themselves don’t have a specific interest above and beyond the general public.”
While noting the AG’s Office appreciates the plaintiffs’ focus on issues of systemic racism, Gabrault called the lawsuit an “inappropriate forum for that kind of advocacy.”
In response, Chan contended that she and the plaintiffs were not arguing a breach of fiduciary duty, but rather a “contractual claim”: that Harvard is required to give its donors “a seat at the table.”
“Harvard is fully within its rights to invest in lawful slavery if that is what its fidicuiary judgement ultimately decides,” Chan said, referring to Harvard’s prison industry investments. “But at the very minimum, Harvard must also hear plaintiff donors’ moral and financial concerns in good faith.”
On the charge of false advertising, the attorneys clashed over whether there were any advertisements in question and the difference between facts and opinions.
Murphy noted that state law dictates “the actionable statement must be contained in an advertisement.” The statements the suit references include an op-ed by former University President Drew G. Faust and an announcement from University President Lawrence S. Bacow about an initiative to study Harvard’s ties to slavery, not traditional advertisements.
Nathanson fought back by claiming that advertisements are any public announcements that proclaim qualities of a product and have a “wide dissemination.”
Even so, Murphy argued that the plaintiffs failed to prove that they contained “an assertion, representation, or statement of fact that is untrue, deceptive, or misleading.”
Rather, he said, whether or not Harvard has engaged in a “reckoning” with its ties to slavery is “a question of opinion, and not something that can be proved or disproved as a matter of fact.”
Nathanson replied that rather than proving an untrue statement, the plaintiffs only need to prove “a misrepresentation significant enough that it might influence the consumer.”
That misrepresentation comes from investments in the prison industry and the “sham” that is the project on Harvard and slavery, per Nathanson.
At the close of the proceedings, Barry-Smith said he will work to write and deliver his decision “promptly.”
Tuesday’s hearing was conducted fully by Zoom, as have many state hearings during the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a somewhat unusual question from the judge.
“What is your background on Zoom?” he asked Chan.
“‘Zoom backgrounds for lawyers,’ from Google Images,” Chan replied. “I highly recommend.”
Correction: September 30, 2020
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Amanda T. Chan and Anna L. Nathanson are representing themselves and the other plaintiffs. In fact, each of the five plaintiffs appeared pro se.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge held a special meeting Tuesday to update residents on its ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Various city officials shared news about Cambridge’s initiatives to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. Some of the policies they highlighted include the extension of outdoor dining for restaurants and the city's plan for reopening schools.
The meeting comes as the city reports 100 confirmed COVID-19 deaths and 1,394 confirmed cases as of Tuesday afternoon. City Manager Louis A. DePasquale relayed those figures at the opening of the council meeting, reminding residents to stay alert.
“Sadly, this week, we marked our city's hundredth death caused by COVID-19. This milestone serves as a solemn reminder that we are still in the midst of a public health crisis,” DePasquale said. “We must remain vigilant in adhering to the practices that will minimize the spread of the virus.”
DePasquale said that, despite the city’s fatalities, Cambridge is performing well. The city has had the lowest case count among Massachusetts’ largest cities in the last 14 days.
“I want to bring home again that all we've put in place, I believe, has had significant impact on COVID,” he said. “The city is slightly over one-tenth of 1 percent positive testing administered to Cambridge residents during my last update.”
Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob said “vigorous testing” has been a “key ingredient” to the success of the city at controlling the virus, in addition to support from other city departments, organizations, and the Broad Institute at Harvard and MIT.
“Cambridge is the only non-hot spot city in the Commonwealth providing this free mobile COVID testing for asymptomatic individuals,” he said.
Councilor Marc C. McGovern and Jacob both said Cambridge requires a customized response that may not always be identical to those of neighboring towns or Massachusetts as a whole.
“Making decisions for the state is far more varied than your individual city,” McGovern said. “What I've seen is that a lot of the cities — Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, Framingham — have all taken more strict steps than the governor.”
“Some folks would say, ‘Well, look at what Belmont’s doing.’” he added. “Cambridge is not Belmont.”
Still, Jacob said each city's response plays an important role in mitigating the effects of the virus.
“Massachusetts serves as one of the most decentralized public health states in the nation,” Jacob said. “We are still required on the ground locally to customize and look at the relative risk in our municipality.”
“We are required to have, not ordinances or regulations in conflict — they must align with our state level partners — but we do have the option to have a higher bar, which is what you tend to see based on the decisions we make here,” he added.
The City of Cambridge has sometimes opted for stricter provisions than the Commonwealth. Last week, the Commonwealth issued a series of standards for restaurants to address COVID-19 — among them a limitation of 10 people per dining party.
“Following the governor's announcement last week, the city issued an emergency order that kept the limit of table size at the maximum of six,” Matthew Nelson, assistant city manager for community relations, said.
Ellen Semonoff, assistant city manager for human services, gave updates about school reopenings in the city. The Cambridge Public School District is conducting learning remotely but is offering in-person options for preschool to third grade, students with disabilities, and English language learners.
“Because of the state COVID related regulations, we're operating currently at just below 60 percent of our normal capacity,” she noted. “Many families did choose to defer their slots until January, so despite the reduction in our capacity, we were able to serve all of the families who had registered for preschool for this fall.”
Semonoff said community programs have also allowed students to connect in-person, while following social distancing guidelines.
“A number of parents have shared with our staff that they've used our outdoor sites as places for their children to meet new classmates that they've seen online, but never had a chance to meet,” she said.
Despite Cambridge's relative success in managing COVID-19, city leaders said they are still mourning the residents who passed away during the pandemic.
“COVID-19 has had a terrible toll on many of the Cambridge community. I want to express my heartfelt sorrow to the families who have lost loved ones to this virus,” DePasquale said. “We are working tirelessly to ensure the city is doing everything we can to prevent the loss of life in our city to the COVID-19.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 30, 2020, 8:45 p.m.
After a staff member tested positive for COVID-19, Harvard University Dining Services employees and kitchen staff were instructed by a manager to go home when they arrived at the Quincy House dining hall Tuesday morning.
But after receiving those instructions, a different member of management asked four general service workers to instead stay and serve breakfast to students living in the house — generating confusion and concern amongst the staff, according a Quincy dining hall worker who The Crimson granted anonymity because they feared retaliation.
The worker said staff were told that "no one is supposed to work" and that they need to "sanitize" before returning to the dining hall.
UNITE HERE Local 26, a labor union that represents Harvard’s dining workers, has begun an investigation into the incident and is currently in discussion with the University in order to fully understand the situation. Ed Childs, an Adams House chef and former Local 26 chief shop steward, said the negotiations “may last a day or two.”
According to HUDS protocols, since all employees practice social distancing and wear protective equipment, it is assumed that they have not been exposed to infection. The protocol also states that workers who may have been sharing a kitchen or dining hall with an individual who tests positive can work in another location until the dining hall has been cleaned and disinfected in accordance with CDC requirements.
HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an email that HUDS immediately initiated response protocols and closed the dining hall after receiving notification that a worker had tested positive. Martin added that HUDS does not have an immediate reason to believe that other staff members — including the managers who continued to serve students for the rest of the day — were close contacts of the worker who tested positive.
Harvard University Health Services will complete a contact tracing review of the situation, per Martin. HUDS management has not instructed the Quincy dining staff to get tested for COVID-19 before re-entering the kitchen or dining hall.
Students living in Quincy received an email from house administrator Krystle Petrie Tuesday morning redirecting them to the Junior Common Room for the day’s breakfast, lunch, and dinner pick up.
The normal upper-level meal pick-up location in Quincy dining hall has been closed, according to several undergraduates living in Quincy. C. Angela Dela Cruz ’24 said the stairs leading up to the main dining hall were “roped off,” adding that the modified setup was “basically a condensed version of the dining hall.”
Lachlain B. McGranahan ’24 said Petrie’s email provided “no reasoning as to why” the dining hall was closed. HUDS closed the top floor to allow a cleaning crew to sanitize the kitchen and seating areas.
After the four dining workers served breakfast Tuesday morning, all dining staff left the building. Managers took over meal distribution for lunch and dinner Tuesday.
Petrie wrote in her email that students should expect to return to normal dining hall pick-up operations Wednesday morning “unless otherwise advised.”
Quincy dining hall staff are currently unaware if their managers expect them to return to work tomorrow morning, the worker said.

Harvard researchers identified a potential link between optimism levels and risk of hypertension in a study published last month.
Laura D. Kubzansky, a social and behavioral sciences professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, and her co-authors conducted a study to determine possible connections between optimism levels and hypertension risk in U.S. Army active-duty soldiers. The study analyzed more than 100,000 responses from the Global Assessment Tool, a survey that allows soldiers to self-assess their levels of optimism.
After controlling for potential variables like baseline blood pressure and previous history with hypertension, the researchers showed that individuals with the highest optimism scores had a 22 percent lower risk of developing hypertension than those who scored the lowest. The study’s findings allow for new potential prevention techniques for those at higher risk for hypertension.
Hayami Koga, a Ph.D. student in population health sciences and a co-author of the study, said her team’s research could lead to more focus on hypertension prevention instead of treatment.
“Risk factors for hypertension, cardiovascular disease aren't necessarily easy to modify,” Koga said. “It's really hard to change people's eating habits, exercise habits, etc., and I think this study suggests there might be other factors we could look into. There's many studies on hypertension, but the studies are mostly focused on treatment and less on prevention.”
Koga said although the results were limited to a population of active-duty soldiers and thus “not transferable to the general public,” the high internal validity of the study could have meaningful implications for future hypertension treatments.
Koga also noted her team’s focus on a more diverse population than in previous studies on optimism.
“Usually these population-based studies in the U.S. are mainly constituted of white populations. The strength of this study was that it was able to look at the association in Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc. – a much more diverse population.”
Koga said the study supports the implementation of hypertension interventions at earlier stages of life. The average age of the soldiers in the study was roughly 30 years old.
Koga added that her team hopes to expand on their work by attempting to alter optimism levels in humans in an experimental setting.
“This is observational data,” she said. “It's what we see, we see the association. But I think the next step is, if we actually see – if we intervene on optimism – if that actually leads to better health is the next step to test this theory.”

Researchers at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital found that near-infrared low-level light therapy — or LLLT — may help treat traumatic brain injuries, according to preliminary findings the group published in mid-September.
An estimated sixty-nine million people experience some form of traumatic brain injuries annually, making it the most common type of traumatic injury worldwide. However, there are currently no treatments for the condition, largely because of researchers’ lack of complete understanding of its underlying biological mechanisms and the challenges of conducting studies of actual patients with acute trauma.
The MGH study enlisted the help of 68 participants and of 20 researchers in order to examine the effects of LLLT over a period of four years. To find candidates, doctors screened 4,216 patients in the emergency room of Massachusetts General Hospital, looking for patients who demonstrated contusions, brain bleeds, skull or facial fractures, or blood accumulating outside the skull.
A team of physicists, neuroradiologists, physicians, and engineers developed a plastic helmet to administer the infrared treatment to trial participants.
The group arranged clusters of LED lights over the inner layer of the helmet in order to dissipate energy uniformly to the scalp. A disposable molded plastic piece shielded patients from any direct contact with LED light, while fans on the outside of the helmet protected them against any heat the LED lights generates.
Ultimately, team members like data scientist and Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Can Ozan Tan said the study’s outcome was unexpected. Statistics showed that light therapy could have a demonstrable effect on healing brain injuries.
“Seeing a measurable effect was, to me, the most surprising thing,” Tan said. “I was surprised to see an effect in a relatively small sample size, in this particular study. So I wasn't expecting that, to be honest.”
Despite those encouraging results, however, researchers remain unsure about how LLLT directly helps with treating traumatic brain injuries.
“We know from some of the earlier data in-vitro data in animal data, it has different effects on the structure and vasculature of the brain,” Tan said.
Jarone Lee, a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, also underscored that such preliminary results “can still be random noise.”
“This level of light through the helmet itself can promote healing of the injured brain, of course — that has to be seen,” Lee said. “But I think our prelim results do show that there’s a signal there, it’s that our sample size is too low to really make conclusions.”
Lee said that future studies are on a “holding pattern” while the U.S. Department of Defense, a primary sponsor of the study, dedicates resources to battling the COVID-19 pandemic as cases begin to surge again.

Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences launched a task force on visual culture and signage, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced in an email to affiliates Tuesday.
In response to the recommendations of the University’s Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, Gay charged the new task force with developing principles and guidelines on how to “evolve the visual culture and imagery across the FAS”; conducting a survey of the current FAS visual landscape to determine opportunities for immediate changes; and instituting best practices for all FAS units to improve their visual culture.
“It is my sincere hope that this work will provide a stronger foundation for existing local efforts, as well as catalyze new, more systemic change across the FAS,” she added.
Arts and Humanities Dean Robin E. Kelsey, who is also a photography professor, will lead the 21-member task force, which includes several other art scholars, faculty, and administrators from across the University, according to Gay’s announcement. The newly appointed FAS associate dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, Sheree Ohen, is one of the members.
The presidents and vice presidents of the Undergraduate Council and Graduate Student Council will also serve on the task force, according to Gay.
“How and where we memorialize individuals, events, and moments in our institutional history through imagery and symbols should reflect our core institutional commitments to truth, knowledge, and critical thinking,” Gay wrote. “At the same time, they should authentically represent the possibility inherent in our present moment and encourage the sense of welcome and belonging each of us needs to feel seen, heard, and be able to thrive.”
Issues of race in visual art have been contentious for Harvard affiliates in recent years.
In March, 2019, Tamara K. Lanier filed suit against Harvard alleging that the University unlawfully possesses and profits from historic photos of slaves she says are her ancestors.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an April 2019 interview with The Crimson that Harvard’s possession of the images was not illegal, and that the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology displays them in order to illustrate the slaves’ humanity. Harvard affiliates, meanwhile, have called on the University to stop displaying, publishing, and selling the rights to the two images.
Days after Lanier filed suit against the University, Lowell House faculty deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser announced that the House would not display portraits of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and his wife Anna Parker Lowell, citing the former University President’s racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic views.
Gay announced the task force’s formation Aug. 20 alongside a number of other diversity initiatives, including the resumption of a high-profile search for four faculty specializing in ethnic studies and the creation of Ohen’s position.

After students alleged that Government department preceptor and Government 50: “Data” instructor David D. Kane authored racist posts on his website EphBlog, some of his fellow Harvard faculty members called the posts “horrible” and “deeply disturbing.”
Kane allegedly wrote the posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25.” Entries posted by “Field” on EphBlog reference “Black Supremacy” in the NBA; claim that more than 90 percent of Black students at Williams College would not have been admitted if not for their “Black’ness” [sic]; and interrogate Williams College’s decision to condemn white supremacist group Identity Evropa without simultaneously condemning the Black Lives Matter and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements.
Kane did not respond to a request for comment for this article, or to multiple previous requests for comment from The Crimson regarding the allegations against him.
Joseph K. Blitzstein, a Statistics professor who serves as the department’s Dean of Undergraduate Studies, wrote in an email to concentrators Monday that faculty members in Statistics have been “disturbed and disgusted” by the allegations against Kane.
“We in Stat have been disturbed and disgusted by the recent information about David Kane and Gov 50, reported in The Crimson,” his email continued. “And the blog posts I read about are horrible.”
In response to the situation, Blitzstein wrote that the Statistics department would accept Gov 51 as a related course for concentrators currently in Gov 50.
“Normally Gov 51 does not count as a ‘related’ course since there is too much overlap with Stat 104, though there is still value in seeing some applications of statistics in government,” Blitzstein wrote. “We don’t want anyone to feel trapped in Gov 50.”
“Of course, the Government department should be fixing the problem, rather than the burden being on students to have to find a course to switch into,” his email continued. “I just read [link to Crimson article] and was impressed that the TFs basically offered to run the whole class, at least until a replacement instructor can be found. There is a large teaching staff and a lot of free online materials that they can work through with the students, though of course someone needs to be in charge.”
The Gov 50 course staff and Kane jointly agreed that Kane would temporarily stop lecturing in Gov 50, according to a Sunday email from course staff to students.
The announcement came a day after some teaching fellows wrote to their students proposing that they boycott Kane’s lectures and meet in private teaching sessions instead.
In an email to Gov 50 students later that day, Government department chair Jeffry A. Frieden called the teaching fellows’ proposal “completely inappropriate” and “unprofessional,” given their job positions. But Blitzstein wrote in his Monday email that he disagrees.
“To me it sounded like they were generously trying to find a solution to a terrible situation in which both the TFs and students are, very justifiably, uncomfortable continuing with Kane as instructor,” Blizstein wrote.
Frieden declined to comment on Blitzstein’s remarks.
Eric Beerbohm, a Government professor and Quincy House faculty dean, invited students in his house to a Monday night meeting to discuss the situation and its impact on them.
Beerbohm called the allegations “deeply disturbing.” He added that the incident “hits painfully close to home” as a member of the Government department and the chair of the Committee on Degrees in Social Studies.
“I’m probably feeling some of the emotions that students in the course and those hailing from the Government department are experiencing,” he wrote.
Beerbohm urged students in the course seeking “specific recommendations” to set up individualized advising meetings with Quincy’s resident dean and its Government tutor, among other house staff.
Harvard’s Government department is currently reviewing the allegations against Kane.

Following President Trump’s nomination of Judge Amy V. Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court, constitutional law professors at Harvard Law School are split between supporting Barrett and denouncing the nomination process.
Trump formally announced his nomination of Barrett on Saturday — eight days after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who had filled the seat for more than 27 years. The Court vacancy only weeks before the Nov. election has invited questions about whether Trump should be able to nominate a new Justice.
Professor Tomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, wrote in an email that Trump “needlessly breached decorum” by nominating a Justice before Ginsburg had been buried. She also pointed out the nomination comes after the presidential election has already begun, since more than one million people have cast their ballots, according to data from the United States Elections Project.
“The nomination process should await the outcome of the election; the person duly elected president, whether Biden or Trump, should nominate someone to fill the open seat,” she wrote.
Professor Richard J. Lazarus echoed concerns about the timing of the nomination. He wrote in an email Barrett’s confirmation could create a conflict of interest if election disputes make their way to the Supreme Court.
“Yet, President Trump has made it clear that the prospect of such a case before the Court is precisely why he wants Barrett to be on the Court immediately, before the election, more quickly than any past nominee in memory,” he wrote.
Lazarus noted he wants the Senate to question Barrett on whether, if confirmed, she will recuse herself from an election dispute, as well as whether the White House asked about her “loyalty” to the president before her nomination.
“We know that the President is very concerned about such loyalty, as evidenced by his asking just such questions of James Comey when he was serving as Director of the FBI,” Lazarus wrote.
Law School Professor Emeritus Laurence H. Tribe ’62 also expressed suspicions about the Supreme Court’s involvement in a potential election dispute.
“There has never been a Supreme Court confirmation while a presidential election is underway,” Tribe wrote in a Tweet. “The Constitution permits it, but it’s an irresponsible abuse of power designed to kill the [Affordable Care Act] and pack the Court to back up Trump’s plan to stop counting on Nov 3.”
Despite criticism of the nomination process, Professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 defended Barrett’s qualifications in an article for Bloomberg News. Feldman clerked at the Supreme Court with Barrett in 1998 and described her as a brilliant lawyer with a “judicial temperament.”
“I disagree with much of her judicial philosophy and expect to disagree with many, maybe even most of her future votes and opinions,” he wrote. “Yet despite this disagreement, I know her to be a brilliant and conscientious lawyer who will analyze and decide cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles to which she is committed.”
He also argued that concerns surrounding Barrett’s Catholic faith should not disqualify her from the position and claimed that regardless of the politics and circumstances of the nomination, Barrett exceeds the criteria for a good Supreme Court Justice.
“When she is confirmed, I am going to accept it as the consequence of the constitutional rules we have and the choices we collectively and individually have made,” Feldman wrote.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will begin moving into the Science and Engineering Complex in Allston during the first week of November after the complex obtained its Certificate of Occupancy last week.
The long delayed move-in process will continue into February 2021. The SEC’s conception and construction has spanned almost three decades. Though work on the complex paused in the spring as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the SEC is now projected to open for undergraduate student access in time for the 2021-2022 academic year.
The research operations of SEAS faculty have been in flux over the past year due to the on-and-off progress of the SEC, SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said. Starting this summer, SEAS faculty have worked through a lab reboot process in accordance with University health guidelines, with labs now filled at 50 percent density.
“Come November, they’re going to have to start to pack up these very sophisticated laboratory spaces, and then they’ll be moved to the SEC, and they’ll have to unpack and set them up in an entirely new space,” Karoff said. “But the good news is, it's a new space that they – those faculty and PIs — designed themselves. It’s custom-built for their needs and long-term goals.”
The move into the SEC will be carried out in waves: One wave will enter the building each week, according to Karoff. Larger experimental groups and staff will kick off the move-in, and theory labs will join in the fourth wave.
Aside from logistics, Karoff also highlighted the significance of considering signage and naming around the building, calling it a priority for the SEAS Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging this year.
“It runs the gamut from making sure that public restrooms are labeled and signed in an appropriate way to making sure that the spaces themselves are accessible to all too,” Karoff said. “Things like portraiture and artwork on the walls and ensuring that they are representative, that they both do two things really, in the case of Harvard — that they honor and respect the historical, intellectual traditions of the place, but that they also are inclusive and welcoming.”
Still, Karoff said plans for the SEC are still contingent upon Harvard’s approach to the spring term more broadly.
“The wild card, what we don't know, obviously, is what spring will hold vis-a-vis students returning,” Karoff said. “That decision is slated to be made somewhere around the first week of December.”
He also cited one of the specific intentions of the SEC’s architectural design: to encourage social interaction.
“There’s a little bit of an irony that it’s now complete, and we’re in a world where we all have to be socially distanced, conduct our lives on Zoom calls instead of in person,” Karoff said. “When we come back, I’m sure it won’t be flipping a switch back to the before time. It will phase into a different kind of operating style than we used to have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Republican Club has endorsed incumbent United States President Donald J. Trump in his 2020 re-election race, according to a Tuesday evening press release.
The club made national headlines in 2016 when it split from the Republican Party by refusing to support Trump’s first bid for the presidency, the first time in the group's 128-year history that it declined to back the GOP nominee. Since then, a new faction of conservative undergraduates have pushed for the club’s leadership to throw their weight behind the Trump administration.
Trump’s supporters in the group finally got their wish Tuesday, after HRC president Wesley L. Donhauser ’21 emailed members with the endorsement message from the club’s executive board. The message came just hours after the first presidential debate between Trump and Democratic nominee former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. The federal election will take place on Nov. 3.
“Our conservative and Republican convictions compel us to endorse candidates that will fight for an enduring moral order, protect Americans traditions, and prize careful prudence in all decisions for the betterment of Americans,” the message reads. “President Trump has demonstrated a commitment to these ideals that surpasses his challenger former Vice President Biden.”
The group cited several of what they saw as Trump’s “marquee accomplishments” on issues including foreign policy and tax reform. Republican Club leadership wrote that they believe Trump has promoted global peace and American interests abroad by “decimat[ing]” ISIS, moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, organizing two summits with North Korea, and meeting foreign interference in U.S. elections with sanctions.
Club leadership also wrote that they believe Trump successfully corrected trade imbalances by withdrawing from NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership and brokering “new landmark trade deals” such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
The message also pointed to what the group considers Trump’s contributions to African Americans.
They wrote that, under Trump’s presidency, African Americans reached “historic levels of prosperity” and record-low unemployment rates prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. They added that Trump has also committed “record levels” of funding to historically Black colleges and universities.
“It is our sincere belief that the policies of the Republican party and President Trump would lead to the most prosperous and safe lives for Black Americans,” they wrote.
Still, Trump has drawn sharp criticism for his record abroad and on issues of race. He has repeatedly declined to condemn white supremacists — including in Tuesday’s debate, during which he told members of the white supremacist group the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by, but I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about Antifa and the left.” During the same debate, Biden criticized Trump for withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation and failing to address reports that Russia offered Taliban-linked militants bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.
The HRC message noted that the club still intends to take advantage of the election to provide Trump and other elected officials with feedback.
“We should not be afraid to criticize any elected official, even if they are of the same party,” they wrote. “We celebrate the debate and growth inherent in the election process and look forward to the ideas generated by the national discourse.”
In their letter, the club recognized several of what they described as Trump’s shortcomings. They wrote that these include not creating an “acceptable” and “regulated market-based” alternative to the Affordable Care Act, diminishing the “broad sense of dignity and distinction” of the presidency, and failing to unify Americans across the political spectrum around a “guiding set of principles.”
Republicans constitute a minority on Harvard’s largely liberal campus, and Trump supporters an even smaller pool. In a September survey of the Class of 2024 conducted by The Crimson, an overwhelming 90.1 percent of respondents indicated their support of Biden, compared to Trump’s 7.1 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 30, 2020, 10:37 p.m.
Harvard preceptor David D. Kane will remain the instructor of Government 50: “Data” and resume teaching duties on Oct. 13, according to an email he sent to students Tuesday night.
Kane’s email comes after students in the course alleged that he authored racist blog posts under a pseudonym and a Sunday announcement from him and his course staff that he would stop teaching “for the foreseeable future.”
“I am truly sorry about the events of the past week and will do my best to return Gov 50 to the course you have enjoyed thus far,” Kane wrote in his Tuesday email to students. “I will be returning to lecture on Tuesday, October 13th and then staying thereafter. Lecture attendance, as stated in the syllabus, is required.”
Students alleged Kane wrote racist blog posts under the pseudonym “David Dudley Field ’25” on his website EphBlog. One post from “Field” on the blog was signed “Dave Kane ’88.” Kane, a 1988 graduate of Williams College, created the blog in 2003 for Williams affiliates.
Other entries “Field” posted on EphBlog makes references to “Black Supremacy” in the NBA; claim that more than 90 percent of Black students at Williams would not have been admitted if not for their “Black’ness” [sic]; and interrogate Williams’s decision to condemn white supremacist group Identity Evropa without simultaneously condemning the Black Lives Matter and Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movements.
Following the allegations, undergraduates criticized Kane and called for his removal as the Gov 50 instructor. At a Sunday meeting, the Harvard Undergraduate Council unanimously passed legislation supporting a student petition to remove Kane from his teaching position and re-evaluate his role as head advisor for the Government department’s Data Science track.
That petition, which students began to circulate Monday morning, has received roughly 600 signatures from Harvard students, alumni, and student organizations as of Wednesday morning.
The petition claims that the EphBlog posts violate Harvard College’s Faculty Policy Statement on Racial Harassment, which defines racial harassment as “actions on the part of an individual or group that demean or abuse another individual or group because of racial or ethnic background.”
“While we recognize that these rules apply [to] acts committed while on the job at Harvard, it should be no less alarming that a current professor entrusted by Harvard is involved with these acts to any degree, regardless of the setting,” the petition reads.
The petition also demands that Harvard waive fees for dropping Gov 50 and adding other courses, allow students late entry into another course of their choosing, and facilitate accommodations from professors whose classes students would join. It also calls on the department to investigate Kane’s involvement in EphBlob.
“I just felt like it was an act of holding someone accountable who hasn't been held accountable,” Benjamin F. Bryant ’22, who signed the petition, said.
Maria Keselj ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, who also signed the petition, said she believes the number of signatories reveals the degree to which the situation impacts some students.
“I think the most important [thing] is to ensure that students are able to continue learning and continue their academic life without having to worry about interacting with David Kane,” she said.
Outside of signing the petition, several Gov 50 students described joining their classmates andKane on one of two Zoom calls that he offered for his students in the wake of the allegations.
Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21, who attended the first of the two calls, said he believed Kane tactfully contextualized some of the beliefs espoused on the blog, though Kumar emphasized that he did not agree with many of the opinions Kane expressed.
“He has very conservative views on a lot of things,” Kumar said. “I thought he was going to be very defensive — like argumentative — but he was very respectful.”
Kumar relayed that Kane said he regretted a number of articles that appeared on his blog — for which he did not explicitly claim authorship — and apologized for his first email to students in his course, which Kumar’s classmates lambasted as flippant and tone-deaf for failing to address the allegations against him.
According to Kumar, Kane also said the entirety of the class — students and teaching staff alike — would re-evaluate the quality of the course and his involvement in it later in the semester.
Despite the petition and the calls with students, Kane committed to returning to teaching in October in his most recent message. Kane ended his Tuesday note urging students to stay in Gov 50 following a “terrific start to the semester.”
“I will move heaven and earth to ensure that if you remain with Gov 50, you will, come December, be glad that you did,” he wrote.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office has extended the add drop deadline for two weeks to Oct. 19 for students in Gov 50, according to an email sent to the Mather House list from David Jud, a tutor and former Government Ph.D. student.
Kumar also noted that Kane said on the call with students that a formal apology addressed to the class is forthcoming.
