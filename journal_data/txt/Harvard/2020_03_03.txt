That the line between celebrity and politician is blurred is nothing new. But this election cycle, the involvement of stars in the presidential race feels like a daily phenomenon, from endorsements and hot takes on Twitter to collaborations between celebrities and candidates. Jonathan Van Ness of “Queer Eye” fame has been campaigning for Senator Elizabeth Warren for months. Senator Bernie Sanders has hosted multiple concert-rally hybrids featuring artists like Bon Iver, Vampire Weekend, and The Strokes.
Two endorsements from this past week are especially fascinating. Actor Dick Van Dyke joined the company of pop artists Cardi B and Ariana Grande in endorsing Sanders. Longtime Republican Clint Eastwood gave a surprisingly unsurprising endorsement of former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg’s campaign. These endorsements serve as interesting manifestations of the problems facing their respective campaigns, and the blending of public figures with public servants through celebrity endorsements demonstrates just how high-stakes and high-publicity this election is.
Van Dyke’s endorsement was an appeal to older voters to consider casting their ballots for a candidate who is often associated with energizing millennials and the burgeoning voting bloc of Generation Z. Among the various calls for unity in this election cycle, this endorsement stands out, calling for the transcendence of generational divides in the wake of “Ok Boomer.” According to entrance polls from the Nevada caucus, the plurality of voters age 65 and older support former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, and Sanders’ support wanes among older age groups.
Eastwood’s endorsement could be interpreted as an indication of the possibility of breaking partisan lines, but it would be more accurate to understand it as representative of Bloomberg’s conservatism costumed as centrism. Eastwood has not exemplified stoic bipartisanship. Instead, he picked the closest candidate he could get to a Republican while distancing himself from the stench of a Trump endorsement in 2016.
Despite the highly publicized nature of these endorsements, a celebrity’s ability to change electoral outcomes is limited — 89 percent of over 2,000 survey respondents said that there was not a celebrity that could influence their vote with their endorsement. The only causes that celebrities have a plausible chance of furthering through their political endorsements are their careers, name-recognition, and egos. So, how much damage could a celebrity endorsement actually do?
Enough damage that it’s worth discussing. The state of our politics has put Americans through the wringer. Bad news, scandals, and profound societal issues that face our communities, our country, and the world feel inescapable. For celebrities to insert themselves into the political spotlight is suffocating. There is a sickening irony in celebrities — often people with net worths placing them at the top tenth of the one percent of earners in the U.S. — endorsing candidates whose platforms discuss profound inequalities that are furthered by the ultra-rich while doing little to actively change their position in our society.
Then again, a practically meaningless endorsement is far preferable to the direct influence certain famous figures have in our politics. Bill Gates’ meddling in public education through funding charter schools and charter school advocacy groups or the history of celebrities running for office, like Ronald Reagan, Al Franken, and even Donald Trump, are just a few examples of dangerous celebrity incursion into our national politics. While we face the inevitable slew of celebrity endorsements that will come in the next few months, it’s important not to lose sight of how manipulative politics already are without the involvement of superstars.

In the opening lines of her iconic novel “Emma,” Jane Austen describes her titular character as a “handsome, clever, and rich” girl who “had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.” Autumn de Wilde, following in the footsteps of many previous adaptations, is the latest director to bring this romantic satire of hubris and misunderstandings to the big screen, casting actress Anya Taylor-Joy as her witty but vain heroine. While de Wilde’s “Emma.” was released in the US on Feb. 21, Boston-area film-goers got the opportunity to see the film and participate in a Q&A session with the director and her leading actress at the Coolidge Corner Theater Feb. 25. The Harvard Crimson sat down with both de Wilde and Taylor-Joy to talk through their film-making journey as they tried to maintain the historical accuracy of Austen’s story without sacrificing any emotional authenticity.
“Emma.” marked de Wilde’s feature film debut after a successful career in rock photography, where she has been developing her own unique visual aesthetic for years. In the initial film pitch that won her the directing job, de Wilde envisioned Anya Taylor-Joy, known for her breakout performances in horror films “The Witch” and “Split,” as her Emma Woodhouse. The pieces immediately began to fall into place. “We never really had a first meeting in terms of ‘Autumn and Anya’,” Taylor-Joy said. “The second we walked into that room the first time, we were making the film.”
It was love at first sight. And the instant connections did not stop there.
“Genuinely, Autumn is very good at putting people together,” Taylor-Joy said. “I’ve only experienced this kind of collective chemistry with a cast a few times before in my life.”
At its romantic core, Austen’s plot, according to de Wilde, revolves around “two people that fight so much they don't realize that they're in love.” George Knightley, Emma’s highly intelligent and sometimes pedantic lifelong friend, loves to tease her for her brattiness, but Emma loves to serve it right back. According to Taylor-Joy, the two actors’ chemistry was essential as their playful, platonic friendship evolved into something deeper. From Taylor-Joy’s point of view, de Wilde proved her great casting instincts by casting beloved British musician and actor Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley: “I hadn’t met Johnny before, but from the second he walked into the room, the relationship was just there,” Taylor-Joy said. “We felt super comfortable around each other. We loved poking fun at each other. We just had this brother-sister thing that was instantly available and we felt really, really safe with one another.”
Yet “Emma.” also leaves plenty of room to explore the female friendship between Emma and the kind but naive Harriet Smith (Mia Goth). While Emma’s attempts to meddle in Harriet’s love life start off rather manipulative, their bond develops into something more genuine over time.
“I think the first best friend between anybody is like a type of true love that might be unmatched,” de Wilde said.
De Wilde said that she immediately envisioned actress Mia Goth in the role of Harriet, without knowing that her and Anya Taylor-Joy had actually been best friends in real life for years. “I just became hyper aware that my best friend was about to wrap on a movie that we got to make together and had done so much incredible, beautiful work, and I was so proud of her,” Taylor-Joy said of Goth's last day on set.
As essential as the swoon-worthy romance was to Austen’s tale, de Wilde still also saw the source material as “a satire about the class system on top of everything else.” The director turned to costumes to preserve much of the film’s comedic effect: Playing with the bright colors and elaborate hairstyles of the Georgian era, de Wilde looked to caricatures for inspiration. “They poked fun at the rich. They poked fun at fashion. They poked fun at men and women and, you know, politicians and at the Royals,” de Wilde said.
On the flip side de Wilde, who included intimate scenes of Mr. Knightley getting dressed and later ripping off his stuffy jacket when he officially falls for Emma like his “skin is on fire,” also explained intended to use nudity to show "vulnerability and comfort."
“We’ve all put red lipstick on and gone out, feeling amazing, and then something horrible happens and you hate the things you put on,” de Wilde said. “You hate that lipstick, you hate those heels, you throw that dress away.”
Continuing this trend of humanizing characters from two hundred years past, de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton decided to break from the original source material and give Emma a nosebleed during Mr. Knightley’s emotional proposal to her. Taylor-Joy found herself with a real nosebleed during one of the takes, making for a totally authentic shot in the film. To de Wilde and Taylor-Joy, this was incredibly “exciting,” but to the unprepared Johnny Flynn it was like “an alien nightmare” — another crazy coincidence to add to the list.
“I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like,” wrote Jane Austen famously of her complicated protagonist Emma Woodhouse. With this quote in mind, Taylor-Joy was firmly committed to not shying away from the dislikable aspects of her character’s personality from the start, even if it rendered "Emma." “infuriating to watch for the first half of the film.”
“If I was more fear-centric, I could have said, ‘No, but let's not push it too far because I'm supposed to be beautiful and charming and wonderful and everyone's supposed to love me’,” Taylor-Joy said. “But if I was more fear-centeric in that way, I think the film would have really lost out… I don't think you get the payoff at the end unless you really feel that she is sorry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge winter is in full swing, bringing with it temperatures well below freezing and early sunsets pressuring us to stay indoors as much as possible. Even though the towering trees in Harvard Yard are dead, the student body is thriving — at least when it comes to the winter wardrobes on display every day in the dining halls, libraries, and other nooks inhabited by students. If you look to your left and right, you’ll see trendy high-waisted jeans, oversized sweaters, chunky sneakers, and turtlenecks galore; however, a couple trends transcend these both in terms of novelty and sheer fashion.
If, while reading the trends already mentioned, you realized the outfit you planned to wear tomorrow isn’t actually that unique, don’t worry; it’s probably still fairly stylish (albeit rather basic). The key to a compelling fashion trend is its limited ubiquity. In other words, trends must abide by the Goldilocks principle: they should be popular, but not too popular. Here’s a list of the top five Harvard winter fashion trends that manage to achieve this balance of popularity on campus.
5. Gold Medallion Necklaces
A gold necklace? How could that be a trend? Yes, gold necklaces are nothing special in and of themselves, but they’ve managed to creep into men’s fashion at Harvard in a particularly distinctive way this winter. The flex kings on campus have collectively decided that throwing a golden lion’s visage around their necks is the epitome of fresh style. The downside of this choice is that accessorizing every single formal outfit with a gold medallion can quickly become predictable and mundane, especially when the medallion is paired with a basic turtleneck, which only leads to you serving The Rock sans the muscle. At the end of the day, no one can tell whether your necklace is authentic 24k gold from Cartier or cheap gold-plated platinum you snagged for 50 percent off on Amazon using a gift card you got for participating in a study at the Harvard Decision Science Lab. Either way, try not to wear it too often or its luster will fade.
4. Bleached Hair
Everyone loves to switch up their hair every once in a while, and bleaching is usually an easy way to do so. For some reason, stripping one’s hair of all its pigment looks strikingly good on anyone — well, at least on most people. If you went home over winter break and bleached your hair to try something new, cope with stress caused by the fall semester, or as a last-ditch effort to try and differentiate yourself among the masses, applause is in order. Although platinum blonde can be a great look, it takes an awful lot of maintenance to keep your hair from looking like a poor attempt at early 2000s frosted tips or a damaged orange ombré mess — all the more reason why the well-executed bleached hairdos on campus should be admired.
3. Moncler Color Pop Puffers
If you’ve spent more than five minutes on Harvard’s campus, you’re probably familiar with the infamous Canada Goose parkas donned by every affluent student within a five-mile radius. For those students who wish to be a little more inconspicuous about their wealth, Moncler provides a fashionable alternative with an arm patch that is a quarter of the size of its rival’s. Moncler’s brightly colored puffer jackets, with their luxury sheen, have become the new favorite of Harvard’s affluent. On any given day, you may see these jackets in a bright red, forest green, aqua blue, or bubble pink piercing through the sea of black parkas on campus. The desire to appear more subtle than their Canada Goose clad peers is quickly lost when students debut their obscenely bright colored coats, costing upwards of $1,200. Despite their exorbitant cost, Moncler puffers do serve as a nice pop of color to make a statement and elevate the composition of any outfit.
2. Cropped Wide-Legged Trousers
There is something so utterly chic about someone waltzing around in a pair of cropped, wide-legged trousers, shamelessly parading their shins across the Yard. Unlike the polyester gauchos that haunt the minds of girls who wore them in their middle school days, these trousers are versatile garments and quite appealing to the eye. They can be paired with practically anything, including lux mules or Vince slip-on platform sneakers. Get rid of those skinny jeans, burn your mom jeans, cut up your leggings, and get yourself a pair of cropped wide-legged pants before the trend is run into the ground. You heard it here first.
1. AirPods Pro
It’s amazing how quickly AirPods Pro gained traction after their release. They were the newer, sleeker, and smaller version of their predecessors, and Harvard’s biggest Apple fans did not hesitate to cop them. Whether you chose to purchase a pair of AirPods Pro for the flex or because you genuinely wanted wireless earphones that produced a quality sound, capitalism still won in the end. And that’s coming from the owner of a pair of “archaic” 2nd-generation AirPods.

“Yehimi Cambrón. The ‘h’ is silent in Spanish, and you need the ‘m’ otherwise it’s a bad word,” said Mexican-American artist, activist, and public speaker Yehimi Cambrón by way of self-introduction. Cambrón came to Winthrop House on Feb. 27 to give a talk titled “Art as Activism: Celebrating the Contributions and Resilience of Immigrants” for the Harvard Immigration Initiative — and in her talk, she discussed the importance of art in the undocumented community.
Born in Michoacán, México, Cambrón now lives in Atlanta, having come to the U.S. as a child with her parents.
“That’s when I became undocumented, at seven years old when I crossed the border,” she said.
Cambrón has lived under that status ever since. In Winthrop, she spoke about the biographical inspiration behind her art, from pencil drawings now hanging on the pristine white walls of an Atlanta museum to murals, or "monuments" as she prefers to call them, scattered throughout the greater Atlanta area and the entire country.
As an immigrant, Cambrón said she struggled to integrate herself in a culture where she didn’t speak the language.
“I felt so ignored and so isolated, but when I was in the art classroom, I didn’t feel that way. That was the only space where I felt that I could be successful without having to use the English language,” she said. “Being in this space gave me all the confidence that I needed to be successful.”
While Cambón found art welcoming, she said it was also through art that she first felt the pangs of institutionalized alienation. After winning third place at a state art competition, Cambrón was barred from accessing her cash winnings due to her lack of a Social Security number.
“I had grown up feeling so normal and all of a sudden someone decided that, because I didn’t have a Social Security number, I didn’t deserve recognition,” she said. Cambrón was bewildered that her hard work could be ignored simply because of a status she didn’t even know she carried.
Since then, Cambrón has struggled with the fact that she was and is "growing up in a system that was forcing [her] into illegality.” She said her undocumented status prevented her from basic aspects of life that would otherwise be taken for granted, such as the ability to be hired or to get a driver's license. Despite these barriers, Cambrón earned a college scholarship, the only viable option for her family. She chose to study art knowing she would not be able to find work in another field, instead choosing to focus on her passions. At Winthrop, she would unpack the various traumas of living undocumented in America.
“You feel the trauma in your body,” she said.
It was during her time as a teacher after college that Cambrón became a DACA recipient and began to feel she could truly be an artist and make a name for herself, starting with her design of the iconic “Education is Liberation” monarch butterfly. This icon signified not only the intersection between education and migration, but also built off of the use of the monarch as a symbol for migration and immigrant rights. The next step for Cambrón was murals, one of the first of which featured that same monarch, blown up for all of Atlanta to see and right across the street from the high school where she taught.
For Cambrón, her art is akin to monuments. They were and continue to be powerful testaments to the life, struggles, and successes of immigrants and their families.
“I want people to look at [my murals] and be like, ‘these are my neighbors,’” she said.
Cambrón described, for example, a particular mural she was commissioned to paint which would be placed over a previous mural of two indigenous Black women. After hearing input from the community, the mural featured an immigrant Black woman at its center.
“At the end of the day, that was the right thing to do, because if anyone is discriminated against in this country, it’s Black women,” she said. “If I have this privilege, and I have this platform, then I’m going to use it to put people front and center that need to be front and center.”
Cambrón also acknowledged her relatively privileged status as a DACA recipient. "We were deserving, but our parents had to be deported," she said.
Cambrón highlighted what she considers to be the nonsensical disparities in how the United States views its immigrants: celebrating a select few while bashing those who choose to sacrifice ever seeing their homes or families again, as well as to sacrifice their safety, in what could only be described as an "act of unconditional love.” This struggle featured prominently in Cambrón’s life, and it continues to guide her art today.
At the end of her talk, Cambrón emphasized the importance of the allies who “shut up and listened” to her struggles and those of other undocumented children.
“I am a product of immigrants. My ancestors immigrated from Italy,” said Jeff M. Perrotti ’85, an audience member and the director of the Safe Schools Program for LGBTQ Students. “I feel a real connection with being an ally to immigrants and understanding the issues and seeing really how I can be involved in helping them to fight for their rights in this country.”
Emilia R. Pfannl '04, a tutor in Winthrop House and one of the event organizers through the Harvard College Cultural Agents Initiative, felt similarly.
“I was also a teacher, so seeing how she was able to connect her work in the classroom as a teacher with her art and her activism. I just think that the three are connected no matter what in so many ways, and to see a person modelling that is really powerful,“ Pfannl said.
“I was an activist in high school and continue to be now in college,” Juan C. Venancio ’23 added. “I’m going to walk away from this feeling inspired to do something.”
Cambrón ended her talk with an open call for questions, followed by “or we could just drink wine.” A roar of laughter came from the audience.

When Harvard Law Professor Adrian C. Vermeule ’90 made a lame attempt at humor by tweeting that principled conservatives would be “[t]he very first group [headed] for the camps” under a post-Trump liberal regime, critics condemned him for trivializing the Holocaust. They did so even though he did not mention the Holocaust and even though he might just as easily have had in mind the camps in which Japanese Americans were interned during World War II or those in which the People’s Republic of China is confining the Uighurs today. A joker who comes anywhere near the Holocaust does so at his peril.
But a few months earlier, when Vermeule took dead aim at atheists, the critics were silent. In defense of state laws that forbid atheists from holding public office or serving on juries, he tweeted that they are “sensible” because atheists “can’t be trusted to keep an oath.” This wasn’t an inadvertent insult, like his tweet about “camps” may have been; Vermeule demeaned atheists intentionally. The critics were silent because bigots enjoy far greater freedom to slander atheists than any other minority group.
If Vermeule had said the same thing about laws in Southern states depriving African Americans of the right to hold public office and to serve on juries, the uproar would have been deafening. Harvard students would have overrun the Law School and demanded his resignation. Had he targeted Muslims, gay individuals, or Hispanic immigrants, the reaction would have been the same. But even at a university whose students detest bigotry and discrimination, a faculty member who accuses atheists of immorality bears no greater risk of being condemned than one who speaks out against, say, abusive husbands and neglectful parents.
Because bigotry against atheists is common and tolerated, most atheists refuse to describe themselves as such. When asked by polling organizations about their religious beliefs, about 4 percent of respondents say they are atheists. But a clever study conducted by researchers at the University of Kentucky found that people who do not believe in God comprise about 26 percent of the population. The researchers hypothesized that, because “religious nonbelief is often heavily stigmatized, … many atheists [] refrain from outing themselves even in anonymous polls.” Summarizing the results of a study published in 2016, one author described atheists as the “group Americans love to hate.”
It is all but certain that many Harvard students are closeted atheists. Atheists tend to be far more educated than those who are religious. According to a 2018 report by the Pew Research Center, 45 percent of atheists and other “Solidly Secular” persons hold college degrees versus 14 percent of “God-and-Country Believers” and 12 percent of the “Diversely Devout.” The student bodies at universities and other places of higher learning also contain mostly young people, and young people are far less likely to affiliate with churches than their elders. Yet, because atheism is stigmatized, many are reluctant to state their lack of faith openly and the influence of atheists is muted.
Because atheists tend to be better educated than believers, Vermeule’s attack on them is also a veiled broadside against education. His assertion that it is “sensible” to preclude atheists from holding elected office and serving on juries further implies that less-educated people are better suited to public service. Why anyone would hold these opinions is a mystery; that a professor at one of the country’s elite law schools does is horrifying.
Vermeule’s attack on atheists also implies that religious individuals can be trusted to uphold oaths. But if that is so, one must wonder how he can explain the ease with which Republican members of the United States House of Representatives and Senate ignored their oaths during the impeachment proceedings? The GOP is the party of religion. Republican officeholders typically wear their religious affiliations on their sleeves. Yet, instead of upholding the Constitution and judging President Donald Trump’s culpability objectively, as their oaths required, they frustrated the investigation, rigged the process in his favor, and ignored the evidence entirely. When push came to shove, their religious beliefs gave them no moral courage. The only exception was Senator Mitt Romney, who was pummeled by Trump and Fox News for allowing his religious convictions to influence his vote. Oh, the irony.
Vermeule’s defense of state laws denying civil rights to atheists is religion-inspired bigotry, pure and simple. It’s time to put people like him on notice that atheists are entitled to respect. I hope that members of the Harvard community will send him this message, loudly.

As coronavirus, COVID-19, continues to grow, so must global cooperation.
The University announced last week that a group of Harvard scientists will collaborate with Chinese researchers over the next five years to study the coronavirus. Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley and Zhong Nanshan — the head of an expert team within China’s National Health Commission — will co-lead the team, which will focus on creating more accurate diagnostic tests, designing vaccines, and antiviral therapies, and will be largely funded by a $115 million grant from the real estate giant and Fortune Global 500 company China Evergrande group.
The transnational partnership highlights the importance of countries and institutions around the world transcending national borders to solve global crises. Though Harvard is an American institution, its role as a leader in academia and scientific research endows it with duties to people around the world. Researching coronavirus is crucial not merely because it threatens Harvard students — who now face University travel restrictions on Italy, Iran, China, and South Korea — nor because it affects Americans — which, as the six U.S. deaths suggest, it no doubt does — but because it threatens the safety of people around the world — sickening nearly 90,000 and killing over 3,000 people.
The collaboration offers Harvard the potential to continue its legacy as a leader not just in the field of public health — going all the way back to the smallpox vaccine in 1799 — as well as in global cooperation. But in the present, Harvard’s public image has faced criticism — specifically given the scrutiny it has received for accepting foreign funding, as well as funding from morally questionable private sources. This joint project offers the University an opportunity to demonstrate its institutional commitment to advancing knowledge in pursuit of positive societal transformation.
Moreover, we hope that through its involvement with the pandemic, Harvard can help take control of the social narrative of coronavirus. In light of recent racist attacks against Asians and Asian Americans from New York City to Los Angeles, whoever is helping frame the discourse around coronavirus must remain cognizant of the xenophobia that this conversation has the potential to generate. Coronavirus cannot become the object of racist rhetoric or a vehicle for racialized and xenophobic policy. The spread of such a disease must be addressed vigorously, but not at the expense of tormenting and ostracizing our neighbors.
Writing of the reports of stigma around the world related to the virus, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email to college students, “That is not who we are at Harvard, and I ask you to join me in ensuring that everyone in our community is treated with respect and dignity.”
That call shouldn’t just concern our campus community, but the global one we are a part of and to which Harvard as an institution of knowledge production and social influence is so deeply responsible. Cooperation across borders  — regardless of trade wars and whatever other sources of stigma might prevail — must continue. We applaud Nanshan and Daley for their leadership toward that end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Currently, there are over 46 million posts on Instagram tagged “#cleaneating”. Many of them come from accounts dedicated to health and fitness, whose administrators adhere to a dizzying array of diets: vegan, keto, paleo, Mediterranean, and raw being the most common examples.
There is no formal definition for clean eating, but that hasn’t stopped people from using the term. It actually seems like tangible guidelines are beside the point; clean eating isn’t really about what you eat so much as how you feel about it. According to its evangelists, clean eating is a way to feel good — it relies on the assumption that diet has an impact on mental health.
What you eat undoubtedly has an impact on your brain, as numerous scientific studies have confirmed. However, a fixation on eating healthily isn’t necessarily a good thing. In fact, the clean eating trend, along with “cleanses” and similar fads, may be contributing to a rise in a little-known condition called orthorexia.
Orthorexia is essentially an obsession with eating “pure” foods. It comes from “ortho”, meaning right or correct, and “orexia”, meaning appetite. It hasn’t yet been officially recognized as an eating disorder by the American Psychiatric Association; the name was only coined in 1997 when Dr. Steven Bratman, a physician from California, wrote an essay detailing observations of his health-obsessed patients.
“Orthorexia begins innocently enough,” Bratman wrote. “But … Over time, what they eat, how much, and the consequences of dietary indiscretion come to occupy a greater and greater proportion of the orthorexic’s day.” Eventually, “the sufferer spends most of his time planning, purchasing and eating meals.  The orthorexic’s inner life becomes dominated by efforts to resist temptation, self-condemnation for lapses, self-praise for success at complying with the self-chosen regime, and feelings of superiority over others less pure in their dietary habits.”
I’m well-acquainted with orthorexia; there was a time in my life when I displayed many of the symptoms. It was difficult for me to eat foods that I deemed “unclean” without an anxiety-inducing level of guilt. On days when I only ate acceptable foods, or hadn’t eaten much at all, I felt almost euphoric; on days when I had “messed up,” I tormented myself with disparaging thoughts about my weight and health.
I’m hardly the only one who’s experienced this; I’ve been surrounded by them my whole life, from athletes who cut out entire food groups to reach “optimal performance” to friends who only eat the lower-calorie versions of the food they actually want to eat. I often wonder if, in the absence of an ever-present diet culture, these problems would still exist. What started out as something positive — encouraging people to eat well — has morphed into an environment wherein people are encouraged to disregard their mental and physical health in pursuit of sketchy dietary advice.
When I say sketchy, I literally mean inaccurate; a lot of the diets touted by health-food bloggers as “clean” aren’t even beneficial and might even be harmful. For example, it’s true that on the whole, vegans seem to live longer than non-vegans, but that might also be because their diets are generally higher in vegetables. People who eat an omnivorous diet high in whole-grains and fibrous foods can be just as healthy as vegans — perhaps more so, since they have to worry less about vitamin deficiencies. Keto diets are great for losing weight, but staying on them for too long might mean that your diet is low in fiber, which is essential for your body to function properly. Paleo and raw diets can actually be dangerous. And the “diet”, low-calorie, and low-sugar products that dieters love are often filled with artificial sweeteners linked to nasty long-term health outcomes.
The clean eating trend, then, has become less about eating well than needless restriction. I don’t think that the influencers who promote clean eating think that they’re doing anything wrong. It might be that, despite their best intentions, they have simply tapped into and exacerbated toxic undercurrents in our culture.
Social media is an echo-chamber; trends and ideas are amplified, often without any real thought put into their merits. Add this to the constant comparison that social media encourages, and disordered dietary habits that lead to restrictive eating — especially ones promoted with colorful, aesthetically-pleasing Instagram posts — can spread like wildfire.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HealthMap, a Harvard Medical School-developed artificial intelligence technology that can track and predict the spread of infectious diseases, is now being used to monitor coronavirus cases across the globe.
As with previous disease outbreaks, HealthMap — created by Medical School Professor John S. Brownstein and a team of researchers — has helped track reports of the global uptick in coronavirus infections, including in several states across the United States.
Local newspapers and social media posts initially identified early signs of the outbreak before the virus drew international attention, according to Brownstein. The technology collects similar local data and uses it to create an extensive, publicly-available map of the outbreak.
The system updates in real-time as it collects and processes data from the web. Researchers with HealthMap have partnered with organizations including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“It provides situational awareness so we get insights globally into what’s happening,” Brownstein said.
Brownstein said the system's goal is not only to identify cases, but also to gather information on the public perception of disease outbreaks.
“The social media mining provides us with a perspective on how the population's reacting to coronavirus and also rumors that people have around the disease,” Brownstein said.
Brownstein founded HealthMap in 2006 with a team of epidemiologists, researchers, and software developers.
Using novel sources of information, including Google searches, social media posts, blogs, and chat room inquiries, the technology identifies markers of various infectious diseases and collects data for researchers and government agencies.
Brownstein said the team created HealthMap to provide clear information on the progression of diseases. He added that it has proven effective in mapping many outbreaks over the past decade, such as swine flu and ebola.
“It was very challenging to get an accurate picture of what was happening around the world in terms of infectious diseases. Either we didn’t know about events, or governments weren’t really reporting them, or it was information that was locked in a whole bunch of different information streams,” he said.
Using a combination of machine learning and crowdsourcing, HealthMap uses information from the web that epidemiologists do not typically use to track diseases, according to Brownstein.
“If you could organize that sort of information — scrape it, tag it, process it, and remove the noise — you could provide a view of emerging outbreaks in a way that hadn't been shown before,” Brownstein said.
Brownstein added that the system can help researchers create complex projections on how diseases may spread.
“When a big event is identified, we spend a lot of time developing, tracking, and building situational awareness, and then feeding that data to make projections, whether that’s through connecting that data to transportation networks or understanding population mobility. So feeding that information to help to form projections of risk,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Public health experts convened to share information, updates, and advice for the public on the recent coronavirus outbreak during a Monday forum at the Harvard School of Public Health.
Health care journalist Elana Gordon moderated the forum, which featured in-person panelists Paul D. Biddinger, the medical director of emergency preparedness at Massachusetts General Hospital, and School of Public Health professors Marc Lipsitch and Winnie Chi-Man Yip.
Hilary D. Martson, a policy advisor at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joined the forum remotely via video call in place of NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, who was originally slated to speak.
Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, China, at the end of last year. More than 90,000 cases have been reported worldwide, and more than 3,000 people have died from the illness.
Harvard restricted travel to Italy and Iran Saturday amid an outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the two countries. The University previously instituted travel restrictions to China and South Korea.
Yip, who also serves as faculty director of the China Health Partnership at the School of Public Health, discussed the Chinese government’s response to the outbreak at the event.
“China has been, I would call it, in a firefighting mode — locking down Wuhan, imposing very, very strict travel bans across the entire country, extending the Chinese New Year holiday,” Yip said. She added that these strategies were consistent with expert recommendations at the time.
The panelists stressed the importance of expanding testing capacity to combat the outbreak.
“Testing is really the biggest barrier we face,” Biddinger said. “I think trying to make sure we can know who does and who doesn’t potentially have the virus is going to be one of the most significant challenges in the healthcare system.”
Martson argued that, given the long time frame required to develop new vaccines, public health measures may be the most reliable and timely responses in the interim.
“If everything moves as quickly as possible, the soonest that it could possibly be would be around one and a half to two years — that still might be very optimistic,” Martson said.
Lipsitch identified two “essential” pieces of information researchers are focusing on to better understand COVID-19 transmission: the role children play in spreading the virus and the number of undetected cases.
Toward the end of the forum, the panelists emphasized the importance of cooperation and empathy over division in response to public fears and instances of racism in wake of the pandemic.
“We are all in this together,” Biddinger said. “We should be grateful for actions of the Chinese, the Italians, others who have delayed some of the spread to help us respond.”
“We should all recognize that we have a stake in responding effectively together, and that’s true in our neighborhoods as well as in the country and our global perspective,” he added.
Throughout the event, panelists reminded the audience of the level of uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and urged them to be prepared for both progress and persisting unknowns.
“I don’t think there is an easy yes-or-no answer to the question of whether we are prepared,” Biddinger said in an interview after the event. “I think we are absolutely more prepared in the healthcare system than we have ever been and we are building on decades of work, but we also have real capacity constraints.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz and former Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel B. Poneman ’78 discussed the importance of nuclear energy in an event moderated by Harvard Kennedy School Professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan at the Institute of Politics Monday night.
Moniz, an MIT physics professor who served as Energy Secretary during the second term of the Obama administration, and Poneman, who served as the department’s deputy secretary during the Obama administration, spoke about nuclear energy as an essential power source.
Moniz said nuclear energy, in addition to renewable resources like wind and solar power, will be necessary as the United States attempts to move toward a net-zero carbon output.
Both Moniz and Poneman said carbon reductions through the use of renewable energy alone are not sufficient for current energy demands. Moniz cited California as an example of the infeasibility of relying on renewable resources alone, with not enough wind and sun to generate adequate renewable energy in the state year-round.
“We just don’t have [storage] today in renewables,” Moniz said. “We do have it today in natural gas.”
Poneman spoke about his belief in nuclear energy as a potential solution to energy demands as well as multiple other national and global issues.
“There's serious interest – a bipartisan interest – in promoting nuclear energy as a response to climate change and also as a response to the need for U.S. leadership on other issues we’ll talk about, like national security and non proliferation,” Poneman said. “But it's going to be a slog, there's no question about it.”
Both Poneman and Moniz also stressed the importance of forming coalitions, both internally and internationally, around the issue of nuclear power.
“There are some people who think climate change is a hoax, but they might think the United States needs to be a great leader in nuclear energy because of our global influence,” Poneman said. “There might be some people who really don’t care about the global world but worry about the climate change.”
He added that nuclear power in the United States appears to be waning as other countries like South Korea and China increase their use of nuclear power.
“We still have a leadership role to play,” he said. “But the leadership role we want to enjoy has significantly eroded.”
Duncan O. Glew ’23 said he attended the event to learn more about nuclear energy.
“This is one of the areas of American politics and government that I’m just not as much of an expert on, and I just want to learn about our energy infrastructure and how nuclear fits into that,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously adopted a policy order requesting information on what steps Cambridge should take to prevent a coronavirus outbreak at its meeting Monday evening.
The policy order — sponsored by city councilors E. Denise Simmons, Timothy J. Toomey Jr., and Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 — requests that City Manager Louis A. DePasquale consult the Public Health Department to settle upon measures the City should take “to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus” and “to minimize the risk to our community if the pandemic spreads to Massachusetts.”
“You cannot turn on the television or go to your email and not hear something about this virus. People are very worried and concerned about it,” Simmons said at the meeting. “A lot of us just don’t know where to turn, so I think it’s important that we get a report from our city manager through our public health department what they’re doing.”
The order requested that the information be reported at the City Council’s next meeting on March 16.
At the portion of the meeting dedicated to comments from the public, William Hanage — an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health — stressed the importance of a proactive response to the disease.
“We think that this virus can often be transmitted before a patient becomes aware they’re infected, presenting great challenges for control, and as a result, we must be more than proactive,” Hanage said. “This city should expect substantial disruption for potentially long periods of time during the most intense period of transmission, and planning for this has to happen now — including support for the most vulnerable in our community.”
Hanage also referenced research from Marc Lipsitch — another epidemiologist at HSPH— who estimated that around 40 to 70 percent of the world’s population will become infected.
“With optimistic estimates of the mortality rate, that would translate to dozens of deaths in Cambridge alone, with many more severely ill and hospitalized,” Hanage said. “We have a very narrow window to prepare — hopefully as much as months, but maybe as little as weeks, and you should act accordingly.”
Nolan told the other councilors she hoped the city could work with Hanage on its response to the virus.
“I really encourage us, if it’s appropriate, for us to reach out to people like him,” Nolan said. “I think if our Department of Public Health can be put in touch with him and include him in whatever work that we’re doing to ensure that we understand where this is going, it seems like that’s exactly the kind of resource that we are so lucky to have in the city.”
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said he is planning to hold a Health and Safety committee hearing to distribute more information on preparedness.
“We have to use all the channels of communication to make sure that people know what they can and should be doing to get ready, and really the simplest way to boil it down is personal hygiene, wash your hands, and be prepared. Have a plan for how you would stay at home and conduct your work if there was a quarantine for an extended period of time,” Zondervan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of federal charges brought against Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber for failing to disclose funding from a Chinese university, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Monday that Harvard relies upon the “honesty and good faith” of its faculty to disclose external funding.
Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28 for making false statements about funding he received from the Wuhan University of Technology. On Jan. 31, U.S. District Court of Massachusetts judge Marianne B. Bowler required Lieber — a renowned nanoscientist and University professor — to surrender his passport and post a $1 million bail.
Harvard placed Lieber on indefinite paid leave while he is awaiting trial in Massachusetts, according to University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain.
On Monday, Bacow said it was his decision to place Lieber on “administrative leave” after the federal investigation revealed Lieber’s involvement with China’s Thousand Talents Plan.
China’s Thousand Talents Plan is a government program that intends to attract overseas researchers and scholars to the country. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the United States Senate deems the plan a national security and economic threat.
Bacow said that while Harvard has policies that require faculty to disclose conflicts of interest, the University has no way to “investigate” every faculty member to determine whether or not they have “outside engagements.”
“We don’t have subpoena power. We don't investigate every faculty member to determine whether or not they have outside engagements,” Bacow said. “There's no way for us to do that, so we rely upon the honesty and good faith of our faculty in filling those forms out.”
“The policy exists,” he added. “But much of the way the University operates, it assumes the goodwill of those who are subject to such policies.”
The U.S. government and American universities have recently launched investigations into “academic espionage” by faculty members, especially in connection with the Chinese government.
On Feb. 11, the U.S. Department of Education launched an investigation into Harvard over its foreign funding from the governments of China, Iran, Russia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.
Bacow said Monday that Harvard appropriately disclosed its foreign gifts, contracts, and grants “in a timely way” and in compliance with the law. He said the University is currently working on a response to the Education Department probe.
Bacow noted that there are a “variety of ways” in which Harvard safeguards its intellectual property, including filing patents and seeking judicial protections. He said the University does not conduct “classified research” and that all of the research the school does is ultimately published.
In the interview, Bacow said he will continue to emphasize the importance of collaborating with “peers throughout the world.”
“I think that it's important that we work with other institutions,” he said. “It's important that we be open to students coming from throughout the world. It's important that we engage with faculty and scholars in different parts of the world. This is, in fact, how we succeed in addressing some of the greatest challenges that we confront.”

Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences strongly favor United States Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over other 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, according to a survey of FAS faculty conducted by The Crimson.
Forty-four percent of faculty members who took the survey said they back Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor. The tally is far higher than any other presidential hopeful. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) boasted the second-highest level of support among surveyed faculty at 20 percent.
A mere three of the 260 respondents said they support President Donald J. Trump in his re-election campaign.
The Crimson distributed its faculty survey to more than 1,000 members of the FAS in late February, polling Harvard’s flagship faculty on key University policy decisions, pressing issues on campus, and challenges they face as academics. Emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty all received the survey.
The 74-question survey garnered nearly 500 responses, though not all respondents answered each question. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from Feb. 20 to 27. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
As faculty head to the polls today on Super Tuesday alongside other Massachusetts voters, the first installment of The Crimson’s 2020 faculty survey series explores the political beliefs of Harvard professors in a highly contentious and consequential election year.
The survey closed before the Feb. 28 South Carolina primary, which former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won handily. Businessman Tom Steyer, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg ’04 and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have dropped out of the race in the days since the survey closed.
Beyond the top-line results, The Crimson’s survey provided insight into the faculty’s political views along a variety of demographic lines.
According to the survey, Sanders is less popular among the top and bottom faculty income brackets. The longtime Vermont senator has support from just 9.7 percent of faculty members who earn north of $250,000 per year from the University. He holds the support of 9.1 percent of those who earn $40,000 per year or less from Harvard. He finds his strongest support among faculty members who earn between $41,000 and $65,000, with 37.8 percent of respondents in that income bracket expressing their support.
Warren and Sanders received strong support among surveyed faculty aged 25 to 35, at 41 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Fifty-one percent of respondents aged 36 to 45 favored Warren, while Sanders came in second in that age bracket at 21 percent. Support for the pair of progressives waned among faculty over 65, with Warren at 38 percent and Sanders at a mere 8 percent. Buttigieg, meanwhile, placed second among the oldest age bracket, receiving 19 percent of respondents’ support.
In addition to indicating support for Warren on The Crimson’s survey, FAS faculty also backed her with their wallets more than any other candidate in 2019, according to an analysis of Federal Elections Commission data conducted by The Crimson.
The Crimson cross-referenced all faculty members with FAS in their title in the Harvard Connections database with contributors who listed Harvard as their employer in 2019 FEC filings. According to that analysis, Warren received at least $19,666.59 from at least 28 Harvard faculty members. In 2019, Buttigieg — who dropped out of the Democratic race Sunday night — came in second with at least $7,091 in donations from FAS faculty.
An overwhelming majority of faculty members who took the survey broadly characterized their political leanings as “liberal” or “very liberal” — forty-one percent of faculty responded they are “liberal,” and 38 percent said they are “very liberal.” Just four professors identified themselves as “conservative” or “very conservative.”
A similar survey of the faculty in 2018 also found that the vast majority of respondents identified as “liberal” or “very liberal,” and a similarly large majority reported that they voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Despite indicating in large numbers that they planned to vote for Warren, faculty survey respondents were divided over which Democratic candidate they believe is most electable. The plurality of respondents, 30 percent, ranked Sanders as the “most likely to beat candidate President Donald Trump” on a question which garnered 246 responses.
A combined 53 percent of faculty believed one of the candidates on the left wing of the ideological spectrum — either Sanders or Warren — would be most likely to win in the general election. Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who will appear on Democratic primary ballots for the first time Tuesday, ranked third on electability among surveyed faculty at 17 percent, followed by Biden at 11 percent.
Opinions on electability also diverged along lines of age. Fifty-six percent of respondents aged 25 to 35 believed Sanders to be the most electable, while only 14 percent of respondents aged over 65 felt the same. A plurality of surveyed faculty over 65 believed Bloomberg to be the most electable, at 31 percent.
Nationally, Democratic primary voters say electability is one of the most important factors in selecting a nominee to face Trump in the general election. Just four major candidates — Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Bloomberg — remain in the Democratic race ahead of today’s pivotal Super Tuesday contests.
For its 2020 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from Feb. 20 to 27, 2020. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,341 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in October 2019 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS titles, including emeritus, tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure-track faculty.
Of those faculty, 476 accessed the link to the survey. A total of 416 participants answered at least one question, while 263 participants completed every question in the survey.
To prevent participants from accidentally taking the survey more than once, The Crimson enabled Qualtrics’ browser cookie functionality to register unique survey sessions on each device. This device data is controlled by Qualtrics, and The Crimson does not retain information that could identify devices accessing the survey with anonymous responses.
In an effort to check for response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, minority background, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, respondent demographics tracked with faculty demographics.
Of survey respondents, 41 percent identified themselves as women and 20 percent identified themselves as minorities. Based on data in the 2019 FAS Dean’s Annual report, women and minorities make up 39 percent and 24 percent of FAS ladder faculty, respectively.
According to the Dean’s report, 41 percent of the FAS were non-ladder faculty — a term synonymous with non-tenure-track faculty. By contrast, 39 percent of respondents to The Crimson’s survey identified themselves as non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 127 — or 9 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of Harvard Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber’s arrest, United States Senator Marco A. Rubio (R-Fla.) urged the U.S. Small Business Administration in February to ensure recipients of its grant programs do not have connections to governments such as China.
Lieber, a renowned nanoscientist, was charged in federal court in January with concealing research funding from the Chinese government and lying to American agencies about his alleged ties to China’s Thousand Talents Plan.
In his letter to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza, Rubio wrote he is “alarmed” that Lieber was able to advance his research with millions of dollars in funding from the federal Small Business Innovation Research program — which is coordinated by the SBA — while allegedly maintaining ties to the Chinese government.
Rubio urged the SBA to evaluate its grant practices and play an “active role” in ensuring that academics who receive funding from the SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer programs do not have “improper” foreign ties. Rubio requested that Carranza provide information on its oversight processes to the Senate committee he chairs, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, by March 13.
The company Lieber worked for, Nanosys, Inc., received 16 awards through the SBIR program between 2002 and 2006 for research into “nanosensor and nanowire projects through his lab at Harvard University,” according to Rubio’s letter. The grants — which came from five different government agencies, but were coordinated by the SBA — totaled more than $5.4 million dollars.
The Small Business Association declined to comment on Rubio’s letter. Lieber did not respond to a request for comment.
Nanosys CEO Jason Hartlove wrote in an emailed statement that his company has not had contact with Lieber in “over a decade,” and that Lieber has made “no contributions” to Quantum Dot technology, the sole piece of technology the company has been developing since 2013.
“Nanosys licensed nanowire IP from Harvard developed by Dr. Lieber which we attempted to develop in the early days of the company,” Hartlove wrote. “We divested the nanowire IP and any remaining assets from that program in 2013.”
Rubio also wrote in the letter that he believes universities need to appropriately vet their faculty, who are “competing and bidding for these government resources.”
"I am also concerned about the seeming lack of appropriate due diligence on the part of Harvard University to assess the ties their professors have with foreign entities,” Rubio wrote. “It is imperative that the SBA is playing an active role, to the extent possible, in ensuring this due diligence occurs.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Rubio’s letter.
According to experts, Lieber’s arrest is part of an ongoing crackdown by the United States government and American universities on “academic espionage,” the transfer of academic research at American universities to foreign governments.
Harvard has placed Lieber on “indefinite” paid administrative leave and is cooperating with federal authorities while it conducts its own review of his conduct, according to Swain.
Lieber was released from jail on $1 million bail on Jan. 31, but he remains barred from Harvard’s campus during the investigation.

One of 14 states represented in Super Tuesday, Massachusetts will cast ballots today for primary contenders vying for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential election. 
Multiple candidates in the race boast Harvard connections: U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) formerly taught at Harvard Law School, and former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has donated significant sums to the University. Other former presidential hopefuls honed their political skills in Cambridge, too, including former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Peter P.M. Buttigieg ’04.
The Crimson sent reporters to polling locations in Cambridge and Allston to talk to voters throughout Super Tuesday. Read our live updates below.
***
Mar. 3, 8 p.m., Cambridge City Hall 
A consistent stream of voters flowed into the basement of Cambridge City Hall during the final hour of voting Tuesday.
Cambridge resident Teagan Haggerty said she made a last-minute decision to vote for United States Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. received the endorsement of two former candidates — former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P. M. Buttigieg and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
“I’ve been a Warren supporter all along, but in the last couple days, it definitely seems like the [Democratic National ommittee] is trying to push everybody into the status quo with the exit of Buttigieg and Klobuchar,” Haggerty said. “So I want to make sure that Bernie is going to get enough votes to be the candidate that the people chose.”
Haggerty said she hopes to bolster Sanders as moderate voters appear to be coalescing around Biden.
“Lots of people are kind of hypothesizing that he’s going to now collect all those votes from Klobuchar and collect the votes from Buttigieg,” she said. “I don’t like that as an 11th-hour move.”
Cambridge resident Ziba Scott, who said this year’s primary has been “a lot messier” and more contentious than he’d like, voted for Warren Tuesday.
“I like how she approaches articulating her visions. I think she’s sharp and ready to participate in really constructive and intelligent ways in the debates we need to have.”
—Jasper G. Goodman, Crimson Staff Writer 
Mar. 3, 5 p.m., Gund Hall
Gund Hall at the Harvard Graduate School of Design remained a relatively quiet polling location Tuesday afternoon.
Eli B. Frankel ’22 said he voted for Sanders because of the consistency of his message over the years.
“I think that the excitement that he energized in people is sufficient to beat Trump in the general election,” Frankel said.
Sajjad Rizvi, a Cambridge resident, said his decision to back Biden was an easy one, citing the former vice president's long political career.
“I think we need the experience,” Rizvi said. “I think we need somebody who can take the president on. I think he is a strong candidate for that.”
Frankel, a social studies concentrator, said he will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is. He added that he is not worried about Sanders supporters getting in line to back the nominee if the Vermont senator loses.
“The people we hear from are those who are the most energetic and sort of extreme supporters of each candidate,” Frankel said. “When people say that no Sanders supporters are going to turn out for a Bloomberg or a Biden, it’s really an exaggeration of the truth.”
—Jasper G. Goodman, Crimson Staff Writer
Mar. 3, 4:40 p.m., Quincy House
Cambridge resident Maggie Brown said she was “very disappointed” when former South Bend, Ind. Mayor Peter P.M. Buttigieg ’04 dropped out of the presidential race on Sunday night.
At the polls Tuesday, she said she voted for Biden but was not “excited about him.”
“He's the safest,” she said. “I know pundits that I hear on TV — people who are really staunch republicans — that would vote for Joe Biden.”
Despite bubbling in Biden’s name, Brown said she walked away from the booth with a hint of disillusionment over the remaining democratic nominees.
“It's amazing to me that starting off with a diversity of candidates we had, we ended up with all these people in their 70s,” she said.
—Charles Xu, Crimson Staff Writer 
Mar. 3, 4:12 p.m., Cambridge City Hall 
The stream of voters has slowed to a trickle inside the City Hall basement. Cambridge residents from a wide age range hand in their ballots and don small oval “I Voted!” stickers. A woman with a baby strapped to her chest places a sticker on the baby’s shirt and poses for a selfie.
Cambridge resident Mary R. Few, 74, said she planned to vote for Warren, confessing that she does not know much about the other candidates.
“I’d really like to have a woman president,” Few said.
On the other end of the age spectrum, first-time voter Raya S. Keir said she thought Sanders was the “best candidate” for this year’s election.
“His policies most match up to my personal policies,” she said. “I really support him on healthcare and education for all.”
Outside, a small crowd of volunteers holding bright blue “Warren” signs cheers loudly as passing cars honk in support.
—Joshua C. Fang, Crimson Staff Writer
Mar. 3, 3:40 p.m., Cambridge City Hall 
For the first time this afternoon, a small line has formed at the Cambridge City Hall polling station.
The source of the build-up? A paper jam in the box that counts each voter’s ballot. According to the box, 923 votes have been cast so far.
Voters wait in line, some fidgeting and pulling out their phones, others making small talk with others in line.
“I voted for Elizabeth Warren because I think she’d be the best president,” said Caitlin A. Koseck, a 2016 Harvard Law School graduate. “I’ve really liked her since law school.”
“I brought my own pen because of the coronavirus,” another voter announces to the room.

Sanika S. Mahajan ’21 — a Mather House resident — entered the booth as a Warren supporter. After voting, she described the senator as the progressive candidate with the "most actionable plans."
In an interview, Mahajan emphasized the importance of voter turnout among youth and minorities.
"Young voters and people of color and women showing that they're going to vote for the Democratic nominee — no matter who it is — in November is so important, even beginning now," she said. "Turnout matters so much, regardless of what the outcome of the primary is and the convention in July."
Some voters said they wanted a progressive agenda, but debated between Warren and Sanders.
For Rosalind A. DeLaura ’21, the choice came down to supporting a woman in her presidential bid.
"I feel like I owe respect and admiration toward Warren," she said. "Everyone keeps talking about how she's unelectable because she's a woman. If you always say someone's unelectable then you're going to keep them unelectable."

Mar. 3, 3:15 p.m., Cambridge City Hall 
A small but steady stream of Cambridge residents trickles through the basement to cast their votes at the City Hall voting location.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) presence in her home state is clear, with volunteers standing outside the front door of the building holding signs to urge voters to choose Warren.
Maureen C. Ryan, who has lived in Massachusetts for over 30 years, said she voted for Warren because she was the most “qualified” person for the job.
“I’ve been following her, listening to her all along her campaign trail,” she said.
Other voters had a blunter assessment of the Bay State senator.
“She’s a badass,” Cambridge resident Kathy R. Weller said. “She just cuts through the crap and I really trust her.”

Mar. 3, 2:20 p.m., Quincy House
A bevy of current and former Harvard students cast their ballots at Quincy House Tuesday afternoon.
Adam S. Park ’22 said he has supported three different candidates throughout the primary process, eventually landing on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Park originally backed entrepreneur Andrew M. Yang’s longshot presidential bid before he dropped out on Feb. 12. He then threw his support behind United States Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who suspended her campaign and endorsed Biden Sunday.
“I think it’s a little concerning to see what things look like — how fragmented things are,” Park said. “I’m happy to see the more moderate-leaning candidates coalescing around Biden.”
Madison L. Coveno ’14 said she was less pleased to see the support Biden picked up over the weekend from former rivals. Coveno — a supporter of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — said she is concerned about progressive Democrats not unifying behind one candidate with both Sanders and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) still in the race.
“I’m nervous that Warren staying in the race is going to split the progressive vote,” she said.
Still, both Coveno and Park agreed that the party is likely to unify behind the eventual nominee.
“It’s really easy to have unity when it’s just not Trump,” Park said.

Mar. 3, 10:30 a.m., Honan-Allston Public Library 
Several Allston voters came to the polls today in support of the two of the race’s most progressive candidates — U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Recent polls before election day showed Sanders leading Warren in her home state.
Matthew C. Gillick, a Sanders supporter, said that the senator stands out to him as the “one candidate that isn’t bought.”
“He’s been saying the same meat and potatoes platform for the past 35 years,” he said. “There needs to be a huge overhaul in the system.”
Gillick said that healthcare was a particularly important issue that led him to support Sanders, who has proposed implementing a “Medicare for All” system.
“It just makes sense to have more options for healthcare,” he said. “If that means a government-run program, it might not be perfect but at least it’s something that people can fall back on.”
Allston resident Patrick E. Shaw said that he voted for Warren because he believes she is “brilliant.” He said Warren’s education policy was an important factor that influenced his vote.
“The fact that she has a background in education and with the teachers is really big to me,” he said. “I feel like those ideas centering around education are always important to me.”

Mar. 3, 10:10 a.m., Honan-Allston Public Library 
A steady stream of Allstonians made their way into the Honan-Allston Branch of the Boston Public Library Tuesday morning to cast their votes, many remarking on the sunny spring weather.
Elydia S. Riley, an Allston resident and mother of a young daughter, said that deciding who to vote for was “very, very difficult.” She ultimately voted for U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
“Originally I was planning on voting for Biden, even though I love Elizabeth Warren, but I don’t think she can win,” Riley said.
“I feel like he’s the only one who can take on Donald Trump,” she added.“And I feel like crazy needs to go against crazy.”
Riley also said that her vote was influenced by her daughter.
“I cannot have her grow up in this type of world,” she said.
Dorothy A. McDonough, an Allston resident who said she’s worked in politics for “many years,” said that she voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden today.
“I think he’s probably the one we have to go with at this point,” she said. "Not even anti-anyone, but just for someone.”
She also said that she was pleased by the turnout at the Allston library.
“I’m pleased today to see so many people coming, even at this early hour,” she said. “And I just hope we can get going in a different direction.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ripping a volley down the backhand side, sophomore Victor Crouin watched as his opponent, No. 3 University of Pennsylvania’s Andrew Douglas, made a desperate stab at the ball in the back corner. When his return fell short of the front wall, Crouin turned towards the roaring crowd and thumped his chest in triumph.
Crouin had just come out on top in a grueling hour-long affair that saw him save three game balls to win the fourth game, 16-14, and secure a 3-1 victory for the Crimson in its first seed matchup. It was one of Harvard’s six victories against the Quakers as they beat their Ivy League counterpart, 6-1, securing their second straight national championship this past weekend. The Crimson ends the season on a 33-match win streak — it has also won its last 19 home matches.
According to Crouin, staying focused during the fourth game of his match, which lasted upwards of twenty minutes, required immense mental strength.
“At some point, it's not [just about] skills and technique,” Crouin said. “It's just who wants it the most and who can like deal with the pressure and the mental side better.”
“In that last game, I just told myself to keep going and just stay positive with myself [whatever] the score was, and just keep fighting,” Crouin added.
Crouin’s marathon match was a spectacle on the final day of the tournament, but Harvard’s victory was buoyed by strong performances up and down the ladder. The Crimson had actually clinched the victory during the final stages of Crouin’s match, when junior Adam Corcoran defeated UPenn’s Wil Halen to secure Harvard’s fifth victory and its championship title.
Senior co-captain Sean Hughes secured the first victory of the day for the Crimson with a 3-0 victory at the fifth-seed pairing. First year Ayush Menon, playing at ninth seed, secured Harvard’s second win with a 3-0 steamrolling of his Quaker opponent. Sophomore Marwan Tarek put the Crimson within striking distance of the title with a sweep of his own at the second pairing, giving it a 3-0 lead over the Quakers. Junior Sam Scherl set the stage for Corcoran’s clincher with a 3-1 victory at the fourth-seed matchup.
According to Scherl, the team’s shared sense of responsibility was instrumental to their performance this past weekend.
“With weekends like this, we always take it one match at a time,” Scherl said. “And I think everyone just focused on their match. And we didn't want anyone to feel like their match was expendable. We wanted everyone to feel like their match was the one that was going to decide it. And I think everyone really took that on and had a sense of personal responsibility. Like, ‘I'm not going to be the one to lose, I'm going to be the one to get us another point on the board’.”
Several strong opponents stood in the way of Harvard’s quest for the championship. Before facing off against the Quakers, it had to fight its way through eighth-seed Drexel in the quarterfinals and fourth-seed Princeton in the semifinals. However, the Crimson efficiently cut their way through both matches, securing back-to-back 9-0 wins to come into the finals rested and ready to rumble.
“We were really focused on getting every match done as clinically as possible,” Scherl said.
Harvard has experienced sustained levels of success over the past few seasons, but getting to win the trophy in front of the home crowd was especially meaningful for the team, according to Crouin and Scherl.
“I just want to thank all the parents and fans and fans of Harvard for coming or even watching on the live stream,” Crouin said. “I think it was a very successful event here at Harvard and, and it will probably be the highlight of many of our years. It's not every day that we can play with such a deep crowd and so I think the guys deserve it and we’re really happy to win it home especially.”
The victory at home was especially sweet for the Crimson’s senior players, who just missed out on the title at home their freshman year.
“It's kind of a cycle for our seniors, a nice ending to their college squash careers,” Scherl said. “They lost it here their freshman year in a brutal battle and to be able [to come home during] their senior year and clinch it and win a final national championship I think is really meaningful for them and the whole team. So we're just so excited to be able to perform in front of all our friends and supporters.”
With the victory, Harvard closes out another phenomenal year under the leadership of Head Coach Mike Way, Associate Head Coach Hameed Ahmed, and Assistant Coach Luke Hammond. The Crimson will head into next season as the reigning National Champion for the second consecutive year.
This Friday, several Harvard players will make their way down to the University of Pennsylvania for individual nationals, where they will compete against the nation’s strongest collegiate players. More information will be released closer to the date of the tournament.

Join us at Flyby (the Blog of the Harvard Crimson) as we embark on the ultimate challenge: eating FlyBy (the thing under Berg) lunches and bagged dinners for an entire week. (Note: Do not try this at home.)
Predictions for the Week
Ariana: Ever since I took my first bite of an Uncrustable at the age of 6, I was hooked. Eating FlyBy for a week sounds scary, I’ll admit, but for a PB&J-lover like myself, it seems surprisingly doable. Then again, my recent decision to eliminate meat from my diet along with my dairy allergy might limit my options for the week. Lunch and dinner for five days… 10 meals, if I’ve done my math right. It won’t be that bad… right, Kiana?
Kiana: I think having FlyBy everyday for lunch and a bagged dinner everyday will get pretty old pretty quick. Lunch I’d be ok with, but not only do I have two midterms this week — one late at night and one early the next morning — but I’ll also be going to Columbia on Friday for an environmental career fair. Not to mention, I have PAFee Annenberg meetings set up this week, so let’s see how those go. But like Ariana, I don’t eat meat, so I also see a lot of PB&J’s in my future. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, right? That being said, my expectations are pretty low…
Day 1: 
Ariana: I retract my statement from yesterday. Day 1 wasn’t bad, of course, but I may have overestimated my capacity for PB&Js. This whole “Flyby eats FlyBy for a week” might have to turn into a “Flyby tries every single thing on the FlyBy menu,” for the sake of both our readers and my quality of life. I’m going to try to ~mix~ things up each day and experience what FlyBy truly has to offer. Life’s all about trying new things, and those hummus tabbouleh wraps are no exception.
Kiana: I played it pretty safe for lunch, sticking with a PB&J on hearty wheat, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they offer vegetarian wraps that could keep my boredom at bay for a bit. The lines at FlyBy are actually insane, though. I ran out of my 10:30-11:45 a.m. class to beat the lines, but by the time I walked out the door, the line to get in would rival any post-Ec10 Annenberg rush. Pro tip: if you’re trying to fill up your water bottle with water, do that literally anywhere else other than FlyBy. Overall, though, lunch wasn’t bad and now I have snacks to munch on during class.
Day 2:
Ariana: Fun fact! When I was four years old, I told my mom that I could eat mac and cheese for the rest of my life and never get sick of it. My wonderfully supportive mother decided to take me up on this and, after five days of straight mac and cheese, I couldn’t take another bite of it. Fast forward 16 years, and it seems I haven’t learned my lesson. All that talk about trying new things from yesterday, and yet here I am, hoping this PB&J dinner will give the energy I need to study for my midterm tomorrow. I also forgot to order a bagged dinner, so I had to walk through the FlyBy line twice and pack food for later.
Kiana: Update: I had my caprese wrap during lunch while meeting with a PAFee, so that was interesting. Overall, not too terrible, but I miss hot food. I’m not really a fan of chili, and I hate the scooping mechanism (you inevitably spill), so I’ve been avoiding that, but maybe that’s something else I’ll try this week. I really admire Ariana’s commitment for waiting in that line twice!
Day 3: 
Ariana: Another day, another two FlyBy meals. Added the sweet potato quinoa chili and caprese wrap to the list of foods I’ve tried, and honestly, both were better than I expected. Not sure if pregaming my ec midterm with a FlyBy caprese wrap was the best for my cognitive functioning, but guess we’ll never know.
Kiana: It’s only been three days? I think I’m more yogurt and carrot than I am human at this point. Lunch today wasn’t too bad. I returned to the trusty PB&J and munched on some carrots in Lamont as I was studying for a midterm. Tip: Oreos make for a nice snack to share during long lectures. But! I forgot to order my bagged dinner last night, so I guess we’re back to normal dinner food for today. (I’m actually super happy about this. I really haven’t been getting enough protein or variety of flavors in my diet.) Today, though, I learned that there are upperclassmen on the campus who not only have never been to FlyBy, but don’t even know where it is. If only I could say the same.
Day 4: 
Ariana: I just had my seventh (seventh!) PB&J for the week and I think I might throw up. I know I’m being dramatic, but all of a sudden, I find myself counting down the hours until this challenge is over. At least there was tomato basil ravioli soup for lunch! 10/10 would recommend.
Kiana: Another day. Another midterm. Another FlyBy meal. Although I stood in line for FlyBy today, I was not feeling the cold lunch, so I ended up eating in the dhall but kept my carrots and yogurt for snacks throughout the day. I really needed to avoid eating another PB&J after my exam.
Day 5:
Ariana: TGIFALDOF = Thank God it’s Friday A.K.A. Last Day of FlyBy.
Kiana: So I had to wake up at 4 a.m. to catch a bus to New York today, and let’s just say that FlyBy was as far from my mind as I was from Harvard.
Final Reflections
Ariana: Although I’m looking forward to my first warm HUDS meal since taking on this challenge, there was something slightly therapeutic about eating FlyBy each day that I may actually miss. As someone who regularly experiences decision fatigue, the routine of FlyBy made my life a bit easier, especially with midterm season in full force. Plus, it was nice to conquer this as a team… every time I saw Kiana this week, we knew exactly what each other was going through. For now, I’m going to take a quick break from PB&J’s, but before you know it, I’ll be back in that pre-noon-class-FlyBy-line.
Kiana: Overall, my commitment to this challenge was, um, not as enduring as I would have hoped during this busy week. But, I did discover that there are other meal options out there (the caprese and spinach wraps were not bad) other than PB&J (although it is a staple). Yet, I think I’ll stick to having FlyBy only when I must, even though I appreciate the convenience factor! (I’m really proud of Ariana’s dedication, though. Getting daily texts of meal updates was fun!)
