After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite being steeped in two centuries’ worth of tradition and history, the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra has adapted to its new leadership with surprising musical ease. Federico Cortese’s debut concert with HRO on Saturday night featured an ambitious program of Berlioz, Debussy, and Tchaikovsky; its success confirmed that the departure of longtime music director Dr. James Yannatos has not compromised the musical and technical standards of the ensemble.
A crowded house welcomed Cortese as he opened the concert with Hector Berlioz’s “Roman Carnival,” the same overture that James Levine selected to jumpstart the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s (BSO) current season. The formidable musical benchmark the BSO set just last month, however, hardly deterred the best of Harvard’s instrumentalists from delivering a comparable rendition.
The Italian saltarello-inspired exposition pulsed with animation and drive, transitioning seamlessly into a tonally exquisite English horn solo. A few flubbed French horn entrances and a high strings section that occasionally tended to overpower its lower counterparts did little to detract from the ensemble’s procession towards an energetic, brass-heavy coda.
Members of the Radcliffe Choral Society and the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum joined HRO members onstage for “Nocturnes,” Claude Debussy’s electrifying trio of symphonic poems. Debussy’s orchestration plays with texture and tone just as impressionist painters manipulate light and color, and the ensemble demonstrated a remarkable talent for this tonal experimentation. From the mystic wind and high string introduction to offbeat trills and pizzicato sequences in the second movement, the orchestra adeptly drifted in and out of various keys and tonalities  without losing its crucial sense of rhythmic grounding.
The instrumental use of female voices in the third movement complemented the ebb and flow of orchestral sound, adding yet another textural layer to existing pentatonic harmonies. The tonal color of the choir was concentrated in the high sopranos, whose vocalizations meshed seamlessly with the full orchestra to personify a tempestuous sea.
Cortese rounded out the night’s program with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky’s “Symphony No. 5,” a romantic classic valued for both its grand scale and its lyrical nuance. In the first movement, a muted clarinet stated a brooding motif that was to be reintroduced frequently throughout the piece. A lilting second theme showcased the ensemble’s nuanced sense of musical line, though its dynamic palette leaned to the conservative side. The high strings led the vibrant third movement waltz with a perfect dose of rhythmic momentum, propelling the orchestra into a finale whose measured, yet stirring, execution never came close to risking the melodramatic.
Arriving on the coattails of one of Harvard’s longest serving music directors is a formidable challenge, to say the least, but Cortese already seems to have established a musical rapport with the orchestra—a relationship that became evident during Saturday night’s performance. Given the ensemble’s remarkable responsiveness to Cortese’s blend of unbending precision and interpretive plasticity, one can only imagine the degree of artistic cohesion HRO may realize after a few more years under Cortese’s guidance.

There’s nothing inherently modern about John Eccles “Semele.” Written at the beginning of the 18th century, the Baroque opera narrates an Ancient Greek myth about a mortal protagonist whose jealousy for her divine lover costs her her life. But Harvard Early Music Society’s production of “Semele,” which ran this past weekend at the New College Theatre, manages to spruce up the antiquated setting quite a bit, perhaps predictably arranging the action in America’s own period of mythical free love and divine (ahem, drug-induced) revelation: the groovy 1970s. Nuanced but still exciting, “Semele” shows that Baroque opera can still be fun.
At its core, “Semele” is a familiar story—men will say anything for sex. In this case, the man (or god) is Jupiter (Joshua Taylor), the king of the gods, and the focus is on his affair with Semele (Kathy D. Gerlach ’07, GSAS ’13), a mortal. At the guileful behest of Jupiter’s divine consort, Juno (Stephanie Kacoyanis), Semele withholds intimacy until Jupiter promises to give her immortality and show her his true form, a move which ultimately kills her.
Written by John Eccles, the piece itself is an archetypal example of Baroque opera. Each character sings recitatives (narratives that serve the purpose of advancing the story) and arias (songs that do not move the plot forward). Characters are accompanied by a small pit orchestra of strings and a harpsichord. Eccles’ “Semele” is a more sexually graphic version than the better-known Handel opera of the same name. Because the Early Music Society shifts the setting of the story, however, the raunchy nature of the opera does not seem as out-of-place as it might have at the time of its creation.
The costume design of “Semele” orients the audience immediately to the ’70s. Costume designers Janice J. He ’11 and Ashley N. Kaupert ’12 ensure that each costume has at least a hint of either the disco era or flower power. For example, the priests wear bellbottoms or a long, flowery skirt with a headscarf. The dresses of Juno and those of Iris (Aria L. Guarino ’13), the goddess of the rainbow and handmaiden to Juno, are ball gowns with an inner layer of flashy neon fabric showing through. Although the costumes remain fairly true to the ’70s setting throughout the show, at one point, Jupiter changes from his mortal appearance—decked in a brown leather jacket—to his deified appearance, which features a white ponytailed wig. Juno, as well, sports a white wig. Both headpieces are reminiscent of early British royalty, and show that the couple is the oldest and most experienced of the gods—a revelation cohesive with the idea that they ultimately stay together because of tradition, though not without a little trickery.
The cast of “Semele,” remarkably, is without a single weak link. Each member displays a mastery of his or her part, with almost flawless singing and acting. This is even more to their credit in light of the diversity of experience levels throughout, from debuting actress Guarino in a stand-out performance, to operatic veterans such as Gerlach and Taylor.
Lily T. Kass ’10, as Ino, Semele’s sister, and Robin W. Reinert ’10, as Cupid, are particularly notable. Kass—decked out in a bright mini-skirt, white tights, and high heels—plays Ino perfectly. Her lovelorn glances and flirtatious advances towards Semele’s betrothed, Athamas (Clare McNamara), provide much of the comic relief throughout Act I. More than just funny, Kass fills the role of the unappreciated lover with darling and panache. During Athamas’ aria about Semele’s insensitivity, for instance, Kass checks her makeup and bats her eyes lovingly. Her attempts are not for naught, as she and Athamas become engaged by the end of the opera.
When Kass isn’t on stage providing comedic action, Reinert takes her place there with spunk and energy. Portraying the playful and mischievous cupid, Reinert is garbed in a mismatched white and red-checkered shirt and pants, with a pair of aviator shades to match. Not only are her arias beautifully sung, but she is constantly in character, whether snuggling next to the sleeping Semele after Jupiter has left her, or serving drinks in Solo cups to the cast while they sing joyfully about everything working out the way it should have. This, the final scene, is especially hysterical. Semele dies, Ino and Athamas become engaged, and the entire cast joyously celebrates, completely ignoring Semele, whose corpse remains noticeably on stage.
The only thing that detracts from this production is that, at times, the pit orchestra overpowers the vocalists. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, it distracts from the action on stage and causes the lines in certain scenes to be lost.
Without a boring moment, “Semele” takes the audience on an exciting journey through this mythological tale, masterfully incorporating the dated material into a more functional setting. And though Eccles’ Baroque opera is ‘broke,’ in this production, the Harvard Early Music Society fixes it.

Hyperion Shakespeare Company’s “Richard II” wants very badly to explore the politics of gender. The production, which ran this weekend in the Horner Room of the Agassiz Theater, brings an all-female cast to Shakespeare’s history play in an attempt to question the nature of power and whether an authoritative ruler needs to be aggressively masculine. In reality, however, the production only half succeeds in its goal; though it successfully reinvents the character of Richard, it leaves the rest of the cast lagging behind. The directorial decision to focus on Richard reduces the play from a deep meditation on power to a simple, albeit fascinating, character study.
“Richard II” is a surprisingly underrated work, often lost in the adoration heaped upon Shakespeare’s more famous plays. Yet it is one of his most vital and affecting pieces; the tale of Richard’s deposition by Henry Bolingbroke addresses the key question of what it means to be a king and what it means to overthrow one. By approaching this classic tale of Richard II with a new angle, Hyperion ambitiously turns the audience’s attention to a play worth exploring for its mix of political and personal drama.
The original portrayal of Richard II cast the ruler as weak, poetic—even feminine—and constantly struggling to live up to his position. The decision by director Meryl H. Federman ’11 to use only female actresses for this production appears to be motivated by this original depiction, and it is a choice that defines the play. The production makes no effort to bring any other new aspects to the script, relying solely on its unorthodox casting to make its claims about femininity.
A very static performance, “Richard II” features little physical action besides two very brief sword fights and the comically repetitive throwing down of gauntlets to challenge enemies. Generally the actors stand in one place and deliver their lines, moving only occasionally to engage the other characters. The stage is similarly uneventful. The intimate Horner Room is barely altered; a throne and the room’s balcony are the totality of the set. The production therefore relies totally on its actresses’ ability to shed new light on their characters.
As Richard, second year Harvard Law School student Nicole Kinsley is remarkably successful in uncovering unexplored depths of her character. Her performance as the king is the undoubted triumph of the production and lends some justification to the use of an all-female cast. Initially, she seems uncertain in the role; it is very apparent that she is a woman trying rather unsuccessfully to play a man. As the play progresses, it becomes evident that this characterization is deliberate: Kinsley’s struggles with masculinity mirror those of Richard’s with kingship. Eventually, Kinsley blossoms, becoming a fascinatingly deep character. Even as Richard loses his grip on his crown and his sanity, Kinsley projects more assurance than might be expected from the role without losing any sense of her character’s pathos. When she says, in Richard’s final monologue, “Thus play I in one person many people,” her performance fully justifies the line.
While Kinsley’s performance matures as the play goes on, the portrayal of Bolingbroke by Emily B. Hecht ’11 moves in the opposite direction. Whereas Kinsley is hesitant in the opening exchanges, Hecht delivers her verse with authority, exuding confidence and manliness. As the play progresses, Bolingbroke also becomes a more complex character—though, compared to Richard’s, this transformation is much less satisfying. Faced with Richard’s defeatism but continuing righteousness, Bolingbroke has no retort. This is less the fault of Hecht than the performance as a whole. Whereas the early contrast between the two rivals for the throne is enlivened by the use of actresses, a feminine portrayal does nothing for Bolingbroke as the play goes on. In Shakespeare’s original, Bolingbroke becomes a less assured character after becoming King Henry IV, but Federman’s mission to explore femininity in politics leaves Hecht with nowhere to progress. She can’t revert to femininity, because Henry simply becomes less confident rather than more womanly. This plot progression allows her no other option but to simply retreat into the background and let her personality fade, leaving Richard free to dominate the stage.
The decline in Henry’s character exposes the essential flaw in Federman’s scheme. Having a woman play the king is fascinating, but having women play all of the other roles too is essentially meaningless. Exactly the same effect, or an even stronger one, could have been created with Kinsley as Richard and more conventional casting. Almost all of the supporting performances are strong, particularly that of second year HLS student Mary R. Plante as Bolingbroke’s father, John of Gaunt. However, these depictions don’t tell us anything new about the characters.
An additional problem with the sole use of female actresses is that the two main female characters, Queen Isabel and the Duchess of York, feel compelled to deliver their lines in excessively high-pitched voices, as if attempting to declare “I’m a real girl!” to the audience with every line. It is disappointing that a play so obsessed with the supposed femininity of politics has so little to say about femininity itself.
As a study of the character of Richard II, Hyperion’s production is an undoubted success. By the end of the play there is a clear demarcation in quality between the scenes in which Richard appears and those in which he does not; such is the centrality of his character to the performance’s success. This is due both to the excellence of Kinsley’s performance and to the innovative angle Federman takes on the character. The rest of the play, however, feels weak and generic, failing to explore the themes of either the original play or the masculine/feminine dichotomy the production itself sets up. One of the morals of Richard’s story in the original Shakespeare is that too much femininity is detrimental to kingship. Unfortunately, despite bold direction and excellent performances, an excess of femininity is also detrimental to this production of “Richard II.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Nine months ago, the nation was outraged over the awarding of bonuses to some of the executives whose firms’ irresponsible actions helped precipitate the financial crisis. Now, America’s focus on financial regulation seems to have shifted to the other issues of the day.
But the most recent round of bonuses at some of the nation’s most moneyed corporations has not escaped the notice of the Obama administration, which has ordered average compensation reductions of 50 percent at seven of the largest recipients of federal bailout funds. The cuts will affect the executives of some of the companies most closely linked with the recession, including American International Group, General Motors, and Citigroup. However, other firms that have already paid off their bailout loans, like financial behemoths Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are immune from these restrictions and may continue to award massive bonuses to their executives.
The Obama administration’s move to slash the pay of many top executives at the seven firms that have still not paid off their bailout loans is an understandable attempt to create a sense of accountability for corporate executives. It is a bold policy move that attempts to send the message that irresponsible behavior should not and will not be rewarded with massive compensation.
However, the policy is ultimately little more than a symbolic gesture and a Band-Aid fix to a problem that is in dire need of a suture. Simply cutting the pay of executives does little to address the systemic problems that helped give rise to the financial crisis. The Obama administration now has a unique opportunity to capitalize on populist discontent with policies that correct the lax regulatory regime that helped enable the financial meltdown. Real change to the current system, which incentivizes unnecessary risk-taking and corporate irresponsibility, cannot be replaced with simply cutting executive pay. The recent cuts are, in reality, a slap on the wrist for executives who will still enjoy multi-million-dollar pay packages and does not affect companies who were equally complicit in the crisis if they have already paid off their bailout loans.
The pay cuts will likely garner some level of popular support and allow the Obama administration to maintain an image of being tough on corporate excess. But they do not represent a long-term solution to a potentially recurring problem. Without long-term and thoughtful policy supporting these pay cuts, what’s past will likely be prologue. There are real and persistent problems in the current system, and if the current administration is genuinely interested in securing America against economic declines of this magnitude in the future, it must engage the problem with long-term regulatory focus in mind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I don’t know much about the health-care debate.
It feels good to get that off my chest.
My mystification persists despite the countless blog posts and articles I’ve read on the subject. Thanks to my good-faith attempts to learn something about the issue, I’m familiar with the problem of asymmetric information and the meaning of terms like “rationing” and “end-of-life counseling.” I could write you a list of countries that have a single-payer health-care system or drop a casual reference to the “Baucus bill.”
But I could not tell you very much about an HSA or an HMO. In the process of researching this article, I had to look up the meaning of “community rating” and “guaranteed carry,” which are apparently incredibly important aspects of the reforms currently being considered. I have not read a single word of any of the bills or proposals being considered—and I would not be too surprised if you hadn’t either.
I think that’s OK. Life is too short for us all to spend our time becoming experts on health-care reform. In fact, it looks like democracy might survive our tremendous dimwittedness. A famous result in political science shows that, under certain conditions, even widespread political ignorance in the populace has zero effect on the resulting policy, as long as the ignorance—to glibly oversimplify—is evenly distributed on both sides of an issue. After all, if the same number of people exist who are wrongly convinced that healthcare reform is dangerous as are wrongly convinced that it is a good idea, the tie will be broken by the informed. And no matter what each side may say, neither left nor right has a monopoly on political ignorance.
But one cannot deny that politics has become too complex for the non-specialist. The difference between a successful and an unsuccessful health-care reform bill may lie in a few paragraphs buried deep in a thousand-page text, paragraphs that even an intelligent, motivated, and honest citizen might miss or misunderstand. It has gotten to the point that even politicians cannot be expected to read the bills that come before them, so that they farm the work out to aides and advisors who have more time and a greater inclination to develop an informed opinion.
Yet everyone—not just those who have pored over the texts—seems to have an opinion. Students not much better versed than myself in matters of policy seem utterly committed to one or the other side of the debate. When I am confronted regarding my views on health care, admitting my moderate ignorance is taken as conceding the correctness of my challenger. Some people even see my lack of knowledge on the issue as a moral affront.
This problem is mirrored at the national level. The modern pundit is expected to be able to opine on any development, at any moment, regarding any issue. While some scholars make a career out of studying the details of a particular policy area, the most influential public intellectuals are those that take the broadest view. The same columnists currently writing about health care in The New York Times were writing about the stimulus bill last winter and will continue to write about whatever next occupies the national consciousness.
Most people, of course, do not make their decisions based on extensive research into the area, but rather by following their party or their favorite politicians. Taking a strong position on more than a few issues requires either making a snap judgment based more on ideology than on reasoned analysis or trusting someone else—an expert or a leader—to do the hard work of forming your opinion for you. Necessary as this is, it is sobering to think that our democracy has become too complex for its citizens to handle alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

In May 2006, I met Craig Kelley for an early morning interview at a coffee shop near Davis Square. Though he is a city councillor, he wanted to talk about little besides the Cambridge Public Schools. Kelley is a polarizing politician—often somewhat too dogmatic, even strangely eager to alienate his colleagues—but he does have a tendency to tell it like it is, and one thing he said has stuck with me for the past three and a half years: “If we can’t make public education work here,” he said, “there is no hope for public education in a diverse, urban environment anywhere.”
And so, it would seem, there’s no hope. Just last week, the most recent standardized test results showed that, despite improvements, Cambridge students are still scoring below the state average and that the racial achievement gaps in the city are larger than they are in Massachusetts as a whole. Particularly distressing was the staggering 44-point achievement gap between white and black students on the seventh-grade math test. The disappointing results come in the face of natural advantages that most cities would kill for: notably, a blank check from taxpayers—at last count, an extraordinary $25,000 per pupil—and the commitment of a significant middle-class population.
These positives have long been overwhelmed by a school committee without a clear direction and ineffective superintendents that were the result—a common enough occurrence that many experts believe school-board models are themselves unworkable. School committees can succeed at running districts, however, as long they do at least three things: provide extensive political cover for the superintendent; manage the system’s finances effectively; and think creatively, but not intrusively, about curriculum and instructional issues. On these criteria, two of Cambridge’s committee members—Patricia M. Nolan ’80 and Marc C. McGovern—stand head and shoulders above the rest.
In the recent search to hire a superintendent, Nolan strongly backed Newton schools chief Jeffrey M. Young—and, along with several of her colleagues, stood her ground against the many residents who evidently did not like that he is white and from the suburbs. The experienced and savvy Young possesses both the strong managerial skills of his predecessor, Thomas D. Fowler-Finn, and the grace and consensus-building style of Fowler-Finn’s predecessor, Bobbie D’Alessandro. As Young makes controversial staffing and curricular decisions, as he surely will, it will be important that committee members are allies in promoting reform and not agents of obstruction.
On financial issues, Nolan’s record as a school-committee member has been exemplary. She has developed a sophisticated understanding of the district’s finances and has pushed for cutting central administration spending and redirecting it to classrooms. Early in her tenure, she sponsored a proposal to reclassify the district’s surplus money as discretionary funds for principals—an effort to see the dollars spent in the schools—but it received only the votes of Nolan and committee member Luc D. Schuster, who is not seeking reelection. Her intimacy with the data has also allowed her to discover worrying information, like the fact that Cambridge spends so much more than other districts but without the lower teacher-to-student ratios to show for it.
McGovern, for his part, brings an unfortunately unique perspective to the school committee, for, as a youth social worker, he is the only member of the committee who actually works with children. His professional background is reflected in his priorities: Where Nolan often pushes for better market research and financial management, McGovern’s concerns are more oriented toward the classroom and pedagogy. He has pushed to spend more resources on students with special needs and has called for the district to create a comprehensive plan to improve the educational climates in schools, including an anti-bullying strategy. Crucially, he has been the strongest supporter of an early childhood education center, which would provide programs to ensure that all children begin kindergarten on a level playing field.
Today it’s as rare for Harvard students to become involved in Cambridge issues as it is for a Cantabrigian to vote in local elections. The reason I’ve paid attention for so many years is that I just can’t shake what Craig Kelley said to me during that early morning interview. Making public education work in Cambridge has proved to be far harder than most people thought, but in the past year the stars have begun to align. When Cambridge voters go to the polls next Tuesday, I hope they mark their ballots for the two committee members who have the strongest records of bringing positive change to the city’s public schools.
Paras D. Bhayani ’09, a Teach for America corps member in Chicago, was managing editor of The Harvard Crimson in 2008. He previously covered both the Cambridge Public Schools and the 2007 city council and school committee elections.

Early in her tenure, she sponsored a proposal to reclassify the district’s surplus money as discretionary funds for principals—an effort to see the dollars spent in the schools—but it received only the votes of Nolan and committee member Luc D. Schuster, who is not seeking reelection. Her intimacy with the data has also allowed her to discover worrying information, like the fact that Cambridge spends so much more than other districts but without the lower teacher-to-student ratios to show for it.
McGovern, for his part, brings an unfortunately unique perspective to the school committee, for, as a youth social worker, he is the only member of the committee who actually works with children. His professional background is reflected in his priorities: Where Nolan often pushes for better market research and financial management, McGovern’s concerns are more oriented toward the classroom and pedagogy. He has pushed to spend more resources on students with special needs and has called for the district to create a comprehensive plan to improve the educational climates in schools, including an anti-bullying strategy. Crucially, he has been the strongest supporter of an early childhood education center, which would provide programs to ensure that all children begin kindergarten on a level playing field.
Today it’s as rare for Harvard students to become involved in Cambridge issues as it is for a Cantabrigian to vote in local elections. The reason I’ve paid attention for so many years is that I just can’t shake what Craig Kelley said to me during that early morning interview. Making public education work in Cambridge has proved to be far harder than most people thought, but in the past year the stars have begun to align. When Cambridge voters go to the polls next Tuesday, I hope they mark their ballots for the two committee members who have the strongest records of bringing positive change to the city’s public schools.
Paras D. Bhayani ’09, a Teach for America corps member in Chicago, was managing editor of The Harvard Crimson in 2008. He previously covered both the Cambridge Public Schools and the 2007 city council and school committee elections.
In May 2006, I met Craig Kelley for an early morning interview at a coffee shop near Davis Square. Though he is a city councillor, he wanted to talk about little besides the Cambridge Public Schools. Kelley is a polarizing politician—often somewhat too dogmatic, even strangely eager to alienate his colleagues—but he does have a tendency to tell it like it is, and one thing he said has stuck with me for the past three and a half years: “If we can’t make public education work here,” he said, “there is no hope for public education in a diverse, urban environment anywhere.”
And so, it would seem, there’s no hope. Just last week, the most recent standardized test results showed that, despite improvements, Cambridge students are still scoring below the state average and that the racial achievement gaps in the city are larger than they are in Massachusetts as a whole. Particularly distressing was the staggering 44-point achievement gap between white and black students on the seventh-grade math test. The disappointing results come in the face of natural advantages that most cities would kill for: notably, a blank check from taxpayers—at last count, an extraordinary $25,000 per pupil—and the commitment of a significant middle-class population.
These positives have long been overwhelmed by a school committee without a clear direction and ineffective superintendents that were the result—a common enough occurrence that many experts believe school-board models are themselves unworkable. School committees can succeed at running districts, however, as long they do at least three things: provide extensive political cover for the superintendent; manage the system’s finances effectively; and think creatively, but not intrusively, about curriculum and instructional issues. On these criteria, two of Cambridge’s committee members—Patricia M. Nolan ’80 and Marc C. McGovern—stand head and shoulders above the rest.
In the recent search to hire a superintendent, Nolan strongly backed Newton schools chief Jeffrey M. Young—and, along with several of her colleagues, stood her ground against the many residents who evidently did not like that he is white and from the suburbs. The experienced and savvy Young possesses both the strong managerial skills of his predecessor, Thomas D. Fowler-Finn, and the grace and consensus-building style of Fowler-Finn’s predecessor, Bobbie D’Alessandro. As Young makes controversial staffing and curricular decisions, as he surely will, it will be important that committee members are allies in promoting reform and not agents of obstruction.
On financial issues, Nolan’s record as a school-committee member has been exemplary. She has developed a sophisticated understanding of the district’s finances and has pushed for cutting central administration spending and redirecting it to classrooms. Early in her tenure, she sponsored a proposal to reclassify the district’s surplus money as discretionary funds for principals—an effort to see the dollars spent in the schools—but it received only the votes of Nolan and committee member Luc D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Big Brother lives next door, and he loves playing online games for cash. Next month, a British firm will launch a website that allows people to win money for reporting crimes recorded by private security cameras. Businesses who own closed circuit television equipment can pay a fee to include their video feed in the game, and those fees get redistributed as prizes to players who report a crime in progress.
There are lots of things wrong with this picture. The most obvious critique of the game is that opening up private cameras to public viewing is a gross invasion of privacy. Since anyone can “play,” it gives carte blanche to snoopers to keep tabs on their neighbors and relatives as they go to the bank or the grocery store and opens up a world of possibilities for stalkers. It could easily lead to harassment, enabling perverts to ogle attractive women, racists to target minorities, and reactionaries to sniff out atheists or communists. It’s only a matter of time before footage of an embarrassing moment, or, worse, someone flashing her social security number, ends up on YouTube.
The game’s website alleges that players will not get to choose their camera feed and have no way of knowing the location of a particular camera. However, it’s likely that determined hackers will be able to tease more information out of the server—especially since the venture was launched by a former restaurant owner rather than a seasoned Internet-technology security veteran.
It is possible that this “game” will actually increase crime. Savvy players may realize that they could score a far greater reward by individually blackmailing the criminal they caught rather than reporting her to authorities for the reward. Drug dealers and gang leaders could use the video feeds as a way to recruit hoodlums hanging out in a particular location. Experienced thieves would get a gold mine of information about the businesses themselves, such as when employees shift in and out, that could help them commit robbery.
But even if the game runs without a hitch, there are deeper ethical problems that arise when companies encourage citizens to treat each other as potential transgressors and reward people for reporting their neighbors.
As the number of CCTV cameras has skyrocketed in recent years, civil libertarian groups, like the American Civil Liberties Union and its counterparts in other countries, have argued against their spread as a matter of principle. Britain now has more cameras per person than anywhere else in the world, and certain areas of the U.S. are not far behind: New York City now uses thousands of public cameras, and residents have become more receptive to surveillance after the World Trade Center attacks in 2001.
But the cameras themselves aren’t the problem. Like most technologies, the ethics of CCTV equipment don’t concern the technology itself, but how humans use it. Machines don’t have morals—we do. For instance, cameras have indeed been marginally useful in solving British crime, although a few high-profile cases such as the London Underground bombing in 2005 have given the public the false impression that the cameras are some kind of silver bullet. A UK police chiefs’ report in 2008 alleged that only three percent of crimes were solved through CCTV footage.
Supporters often push public cameras as a way of reducing crime, acting as a cheaper alternative to a police force. In reality, while CCTV shows some ability to deter premeditated property crime, such as thefts in parking lots, it can’t prevent more serious transgressions. A recent study by the University of California suggests that San Francisco’s $700,000 program to install public cameras has had no effect on violent crime since they were installed in 2005.
Therefore, it is wrong to frame the debate in terms of a tradeoff between privacy and security. Take, for example, the London police reviewing the subway footage to identify suspects after the 2005 bombing. This had a minimal effect on privacy and served a purpose far different than providing security: administering justice.
By contrast, the online game that enables players to snitch on criminals in the act is a particularly pernicious use of the technology. Naively, it may seem that having fellow citizens behind the video screens would be preferable to anonymous government bureaucrats or corrupt policemen. But if we encourage average citizens to start treating their neighbors and coworkers as suspects before a crime has even been committed, it undermines the natural trust that allows society to function. At the extreme, we will become like Congress in the ’50s, Germany in the ’30s, Salem in the 1690s, or, most appropriately, George Orwell’s dystopian vision of 1984.
So far, Harvard’s approach to CCTV ranges from mundane uses like identifying which delivery truck is at a docking bay to productive crime-solving like reviewing tapes after a theft. But given that CCTV is here to stay, we all have a duty to ensure it continues to be used responsibly on campus and that the world follows suit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a move that clarified why administrators have tamed fiscal messages of late after months of stressing the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ impending financial deficit, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith delivered the news Friday that the school had posted a $58.6 million surplus in its unrestricted funds for the fiscal year that ended June 2009. The figure, released Friday in Smith’s Dean’s Annual Report, was balanced by a consistent emphasis that most of the gains were “the result of one-time events,” and that, as expected, much still has to be done to close a remaining $110 million deficit. Still, Smith noted that FAS received about $33 million in unrestricted gifts from two anonymous donors this past year, while also making a one-time withdrawal of $20 million in cash from its endowment to help offset the increased costs of the middle-income financial aid initiative. Both funding sources represent isolated influxes into the annual budget, and will not be reported in subsequent years, meaning that the long-term deficit that Smith has emphasized in a series of faculty meetings and community gatherings remains a concern. But Smith wrote in the report Friday that the “positive results from [Fiscal Year] 09 allow us more time to implement...strategies so that we can bring our finances back into balance.” In the meantime, it appeared from the report that Smith’s calls for cost-cutting measures last spring, when deficit estimates ran as high as $220 million over a two-year period, had paid some dividends. In addition to the one-time injections of cash in the last fiscal year, FAS achieved a small unrestricted surplus from various savings measures—allowing FAS to grow its reserves by $58.6 million. These savings included reductions in unrestricted sums, known as subventions, distributed to major FAS units, as well as lower costs associated with faculty recruitment and relocation, which appeared to follow from a Smith letter last December that announced a sudden, severe slowdown in searches for new faculty. The additional savings also included reductions in utility rates and consumption in buildings that were aided when reduced hiring led to lower occupancy rates in the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering and the Northwest Science Building. FAS also pocketed about $12 million in additional revenues from various funding sources such as Extension School tuition—more than budgeted for the last fiscal year. At an open forum in September, Smith first informed faculty and staff that progress had been made on a financial situation that led him to declare “all is not rosy” in correspondence to the Faculty last October. Speaking before an audience in the Science Center, Smith mentioned the anonymous gifts and told forum attendees that, thanks to a combination of windfalls and budget trimming, the current fiscal year had seen its deficit already slashed by over $100 million from projections. Today’s report brought more details. In the report, Smith wrote that the administration should avoid spending all of the surplus accrued over the last fiscal year, stressing the importance of aggressive fundraising, especially for unrestricted current-use funds. He also repeated what has become a continuing note of caution—adding that FAS should be careful to hire faculty and staff only with the assurance of long-term funding. FAS must whittle down its expenses after the endowment lost $11 billion—30 percent of its value—this past year. The Harvard Corporation slashed its endowment distribution to FAS by 8 percent for the fiscal year ending July 2010, and is planning to cut another 12 percent the year after, University President Drew G. Faust said at an October Faculty meeting. “I am reminded daily of how enviable our intellectual resources are. These resources demand an intensified commitment to...a better understanding of our academic identity,” Smith wrote in the report. “Like a bridle for Pegasus, the result of such commitment will help us harness our financial and administrative resources to better serve our academic mission.” The Dean’s Annual Report completes FAS’ official financial records from Feb. 2008—the endpoint of the last report—through June 2009. Instead of releasing the Annual Report nine months or more after the end of a fiscal year, Smith said he will now publish the report every October to detail the most recently closed fiscal year. —Staff writer Bonnie J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In collaboration with the U.S. News Media Group, last Friday Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership compiled and released a list of America’s Best Leaders of 2009, which will appear in the November issue of U.S. News & World Report.
The Center for Public Leadership worked with a group of Kennedy School students to draw up a list of potential candidates for the report, which features 22 individuals or groups of people with exemplary leadership abilities.
“We want to provide refreshing stories,” said Catherine M. Otis-Cote, assistant director of CPL. “We want to provide an educational opportunity for people to learn more about inspiring examples of leadership in the US.”
When nominating candidates, the CPL searches for individuals who set direction, work to achieve tangible results, and cultivate a culture of growth and frank communication within a given organization, according to Otis-Cote. The individuals’ accomplishments must impact America and have occurred in the past year and a half, she added.
The list touches upon professions that run the gamut from politics to choreography. This year’s list includes Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75, former Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, Rockefeller Foundation President Judith Rodin, activist Eboo Patel, and MIT College President Susan Hockfield.
The Center for Public Leadership—which was founded in 2000 to provide graduate students with an education in leadership—has been working with the Media Group since 2006 to publish the annual list.
The CPL began gathering notes on potential candidates for this year’s ranking in January. At that time, a group of 15 Kennedy School students drew up a short-list of about 300 individuals, which was then pared down 100 candidates.
Those names were then passed along to a selection committee of 30 professionals from varying fields, Otis-Cote said. The final selection was sent to U.S. News, which profiled each honoree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nationally-renowned cardiologist Elizabeth G. Nabel will take the helm of two major Boston teaching hospitals—including the Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital—administrators announced last Thursday.
Nabel is currently director of the $3 billion National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health.
According to selected for both her research and administrative experience, according to G. Marshall Moriarty ’64, chairman of the Brigham’s Board of Trustees. “We have a lot of high-powered researchers,” Moriarty said. “We need someone who can deal with the faculty members as an equal.”
Nabel, who Moriarty said emphasized patient care during her term at NIH, has also worked personally with local residents in Washington, D.C. This experience, he said, has prepared her to lead a premier research institution that also serves as a community hospital for the Jamaica Plain, Dorchester, and Roxbury neighborhods.
“She has the whole package,” Moriarty said.
For Nabel, who completed her residency at Brigham over 20 years ago, accepting this position represents a return to her roots within the Harvard medical community. “I see this as an opportunity to come home in many ways,” she said, adding that she had met her husband and given birth to her first child at Brigham.
In 2007, Nabel had the opportunity to return to Harvard when she was considered for Dean of Harvard Medical School, but she did not pursue the post due to family commitments. Now that her youngest daughter is about to graduate from high school, Nabel is no longer as concerned about uprooting her home in D.C. and relocating to Boston.
As part of her new position, Nabel will also oversee a second institution, the Tufts-affiliated Faulkner Hospital, which is also run by Partners Healthcare, a conglomerate that oversees several local medical institutions.
Nabel said that both Brigham and Faulkner will continue to emphasize innovation in diagnostics, therapeutics, and other areas of patient care.
Given the current economic climate, the hospitals will face inevitable fiscal challenges, Nabel said, but these are the same difficulties that hospital presidents across the country must address.
Still, patients and their families will continue to remain at the forefront of the hospitals’ mission.
“We will make sure we do not lose sight of those very important values,” she said.
Nabel, who will spend the first few months of her tenure learning about the hospitals’ current clinical and research programs, said that setting a specific agenda would be “premature” at this point.

The Harvard College Queer Students and Allies and the Transgender Task Force have long struggled to clarify their respective roles in the Harvard queer community, but in the last few months, the two student groups have attempted to improve communication in an effort to create a more unified queer community at Harvard.
In 2008, TTF was designated as an autonomous subcommittee of QSA, but only this year have the two organizations clarified certain responsibilities and integrated others, according to leaders of the groups.
“We set new expectations and clarified how leaders of each organization relate to the other,” said Eva B. Rosenberg ’10, chair of the Task Force. “QSA made a stronger commitment to be aware of and participate in TTF activities.”
According to the new stipulations, the TTF chair will now attend alternate QSA meetings, TTF will consult with the QSA treasurer on financial decisions, and the two groups will co-sponsor at least one event per semester.
The recent efforts to enhance collaboration comes on the heels of recent changes in leadership, according to Jia Hui Lee ’12, political chair of QSA and a member of TTF.
In the past, each organization largely focused on its own endeavors, but the new leadership has called for greater inclusion and unity between the groups, he said.
“We wanted a mutually beneficial relationship,” said QSA Treasurer Antonio Iglesias III ’10. “QSA wants to reach every single person who falls under the queer umbrella, and we’ve developed this relationship so we can cater to different members of the community.”
Historically, QSA and TTF have had different organizational goals—TTF focuses on raising awareness of trans issues on campus, while QSA seeks to provide a social space for the queer community and engages in activism and other campus-wide activities, according to Lee.
“It hasn’t always been the most friendly, collaborative relationship,” said Marco Chan ’11, co-chair of QSA. “Working more closely and supporting each other goes to show that rather than harboring any divisions, we’re in this together.”
Chan said he hopes that the heightened collaboration will send a strong message that despite the varying organizational goals between the two groups, they can both raise awareness and support for the queer community in their respective ways.
“Although the goals may be separate—one being more political and one being more social—it’s unifying because we are making sure that the identity of being queer isn’t fixed,” Lee said. “There’s a lot of room for people to fit in anywhere they want to.”
The collaboration, after all, seeks to unite students in spite of their differences, Chan said.
“We’re doing all we can to make sure there’s a community for anyone who cares to be a part of it—whether not out, coming out, or walking down the street draped in a giant rainbow flag,” Chan said.

As part of International Day of Climate Action, members of the Harvard community rallied this weekend to draw attention to the threats posed by climate change and to push for the passage of more aggressive legislation at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen this December.
Over 170 countries across the globe participated in activities to raise awareness about global warming in anticipation of December’s conference.
At Harvard, a group of students focused on more tangible efforts towards reducing carbon emissions. Mobilized by the Environmental Action Committee, these students learned how to “weatherize” homes, a process that retrofits homes to be more energy efficient by sealing windows and patching holes in several Cambridge buildings.
“The best way to raise awareness is not to run around shouting but to take action,” said Jackson S. Salovaara ’11, an EAC member who organized the weatherization effort. “Improving energy efficiency will be a big piece of combating global warming.”
Students also learned other masonry and electrical techniques from professionals who volunteer for the Home Energy Efficiency Team, a group that brings Cambridge community members together to weatherize local homes.
“We’re facing a crisis and we need to mobilize as a community, which is what we hope weatherization does,” said Steve Morr-Wineman, a member of the HEET Board of Directors. “Our spirit and practice is that we need to work together if we are to have any chance at all of facing this problem.”
On campus, Harvard University Operations Services also drew attention to environmental issues by participating in the Recycling Game Day Challenge. The competition, which is sponsored by the Environmental Protection Agency, encourages colleges and universities across the nation to promote recycling at their football games.
At the Harvard-Princeton football game on Saturday, UOS and Harvard resource efficiency program volunteers handed out recycling bags at the tailgate and also played a short film at halftime featuring Harvard quarterback Carl D. Ehrlich ’10 endorsing recycling at Harvard.
Efforts to combat the urgent threat of climate change were not confined to the International Day of Climate Action. Several Harvard students and faculty from the Harvard Divinity School took part in a protest at Boston Common Sunday afternoon. The protest was organized by the Leadership Campaign, a group of students and other concerned citizens dedicated to pressuring politicians to adopt stronger climate legislation. The protest kick-started a “sleep-out” during which affiliates of the Campaign plan to camp out on the Common until the Copenhagen climate conference in December.
“We refuse to sleep in our homes that are powered by dirty electricity to positively demonstrate our values, the degree of sacrifice that we will make, and how seriously we take the situation,” said Craig S. Altemose, a coordinator of the Leadership Campaign who is also a joint law and policy degree student at the Harvard Law School and the Harvard Kennedy School.

President Barack Obama called for increased use of renewable energy and levied criticisms against opponents of the energy and climate bill now making its way through Congress during a speech at MIT on Friday.
Addressing a crowd of MIT students, faculty, and local supporters of clean energy programs, Obama lauded MIT’s Energy Initiative launched Sept. 2006 to advance energy-related research, education, and outreach activities at the school.
Obama challenged lawmakers to pass comprehensive clean energy legislation and touted the benefits of the current cap-and-trade proposal that he said would make the “best use of resources we have in abundance,” including biofuels and wind and solar energy.
“There’s no silver bullet to do it” Obama said, acknowledging that the question of how the United States will transition from fossil fuels to renewable fuels remains unanswered. “But there’s no question that we must do all these things.”
Earlier that morning, MIT President Susan Hockfield gave Obama a tour of MIT research laboratories, pointing out advances in energy research and technology, including generating electricity by directing light to solar cells in windows and engineering viruses to create high-power batteries.
Citing examples of energy research he saw at MIT, Obama called on young people to undertake “the challenge of their generation” at a time when critics of the proposed energy and climate legislation attempt to block its passage.
“The closer we get, the harder the opposition will fight and the more we’ll hear from those whose interest or ideology run counter to the much needed action that we’re engaged in,” Obama said.
But pessimism—“that our politics are too broken and our people too unwilling to make hard choices,” Obama said—would be far more detrimental to the nation’s progress in using clean energy.
Obama also praised Mass. Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 for his efforts to push through clean energy initiatives, pointing to the new Wind Technology Testing Center in Boston funded by a $25 million investment from the American Recovery and Reinvestment passed in January.
Harvard has also scaled up clean energy projects in order to meet its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 30 percent below 2006 levels by 2016. This September, Harvard Real Estate services installed two forty-foot wind turbines on the Soldier’s Field Parking Garage that will provide up to 10 percent of the garage’s annual energy needs, said Joe A. Gregory, assistant director of sustainability for HRES. To further cut emissions, Harvard has undertaken the installation of the largest institutional solar array, a 250-yard solar complex atop a University-owned building in Watertown that will generate over seven percent of the complex’s annual energy.
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will begin hearings on Tuesday on the climate change and energy bill introduced last month by Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass), who arrived in Boston with the President aboard Air Force One, and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years after derogatory material was posted about them in an online law school discussion forum, two former Yale Law students have reached a settlement in their case against about two dozen anonymous online posters.
The settlement marks the conclusion of a two-year lawsuit in which the two students alleged that these individuals posted sexually harassing and threatening information on AutoAdmit, a message board utilized by law students and employers.
The two students—Heide Iravani and Brittan Heller—claimed that the postings resulted in “negligent infliction of emotional distress” and caused one of them to lose a legal internship.
“Our clients were happy with the settlement and felt that they had done the right thing by pursuing this case, being active instead of passive in the face of attack,” David N. Rosen ’65, a professor at Yale Law School and one of the womens’ attorneys, wrote in an e-mailed statement to the Crimson.
He declined to disclose the terms of the settlement.
Rosen added that the key to the case was tracking down the posters in order to discover their identities and hold them accountable for their actions.
But Marc J. Randazza—a representative of Anthony Ciolli, one of the defendant who was dropped from the case early on—said that he disagreed with how the case was carried out.
“You don’t just lash out at everyone you can get your hands on,” he said. “It’s the difference between firing a rifle at a deer and firing a machine gun to hit everything.”
David S. Ardia, director of the Citizen Media Law Project at Harvard Law School Berkman Center, said that the lawsuit offered two important lessons.
“The first is that pockets of true anonymity online are very rare and individuals should govern themselves with that in mind,” he said. “Second is how blunt a lawsuit really is as a tool to fix what the plaintiffs in the case wanted to fix.”
But for some individuals, the case does not appear to be over.
Randazza said that Ciolli filed a complaint in 2008 alleging an abuse of legal procedure.
“Mr. Ciolli has nothing to lose, and now he is a plaintiff against these women,” he said.

Prominent social activist Geoffrey Canada passionately denounced the barriers to education reform as he delivered the Phillips Brooks House Association’s annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Lecture in Memorial Church last Friday.
Canada, a 1975 graduate of the Graduate School of Education, is the President and CEO of the Harlem Children’s Zone, a non-profit organization that operates in a 100-block area of Harlem and helps low-income students bridge the achievement gap through a comprehensive set of programs and services.
After receiving the Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award” from University President Drew G. Faust, Canada commenced Canada commenced his speech with a series of humorous stories about his appearances on “60 Minutes” and “Oprah,” but quickly switched gears as he discussed his slow realization that the government was not doing anything to improve the state of education.
“Unless we do something radically different in educating our most vulnerable children, there is no way we will remain the kind of superpower that we are today,” Canada said. “I am convinced that this is a crisis.”
Canada also presented his vision of an improved educational system, which includes a longer school year, an expectation that all students will attend college, and, most of all, a greater degree of accountability on the part of adults involved in education process.
“I don’t care about unions. I don’t care about tenure,” Canada said. “I just care when lousy teachers ruin the lives of children, and we feel like there’s nothing we can do about it.”
Canada was selected by PBHA student officers to receive this year’s “Call of Service” Award and to give the associated speech as part of the University-wide Public Service Week, which concluded on Sunday. The week also included a number of volunteer opportunities and seminars, concluding with the celebration of PBHA’s third annual alumni weekend.
Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons prefaced Canada’s talk by presenting him with a signed proclamation from the Cambridge City Council in recognition of his work, and called the Harlem Children’s Zone “an incredible representation of what can be done when you put all your energy into doing what it takes to educate children.”
As Canada laid out his main points, the audience spontaneously burst into cheers and applause. Canada concluded his talk with a call to action through a reading of his poem “Take a Stand,” upon which the audience arose for a minute-long standing ovation.
PBHA President Richard S. Kelley ’10, who estimated that more than 1,000 students and local residents showed up for the event, said he was impressed by Canada’s ability to capture a wide range of emotions through his words.
“His speech was both hilarious and, at times, it brought me almost to tears,” Kelley said. “I really appreciated his frankness, his honestly, and his challenge for service to all of us.”
For some PBHA volunteers, Canada’s challenge served to renew their sense of purpose in their service on campus.
“Lately, I’ve been wondering if my work was actually worth anything,” said Jarell L. Lee ’10, who is involved in a number of PBHA programs. “After hearing his speech, I literally felt like I had a tune-up, and I was ready to go on for a longer ride.”

Approximately 70 percent of in-state physicians support the current Massachusetts Health Care Reform Law that authorized near universal health care coverage for the state in 2006, according to a study released by the Harvard School of Public Health earlier this month.
The law requires almost every Massachusetts resident to have health insurance, provides free or subsidized coverage for some low-income individuals, and is the first of its kind to be enacted in the country. National policymakers have closely analyzed the act, which was signed into law by former Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, as a potential model for national health care reform.
The HSPH study sought to investigate physicians’ views on the law, which researchers said can provide insight into how the reform is actually functioning and whether it has affected access to health care.
As part of the study, the researchers asked approximately 2000 practicing physicians in Massachusetts about 22 different aspects of their practice and whether these had been affected by the law’s passage.
Physicians were asked to rate the bill’s effect on everything from their ability to get needed referrals to their patients’ waiting time.
In 21 of the areas, the majority of physicians reported that the law had either a positive or negligible effect on their practice.
Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the School of Public Health who was a co-author of the study, said he and his colleagues found little evidence to support the claim that the bill has limited access to health care and lowered its quality—a popular  criticism among many of the law’s opponents.
In fact, Blendon said, many doctors “thought the law was unbelievably successful in helping those who were not insured get care.”
The study concluded that its findings “suggest that it is possible both to provide near-universal coverage of the population” and have a system that most physicians believe will not impede their ability to provide high-quality care.
“The fact that physicians say that health care is not deteriorating [as a result of the law] is very important in this debate,” Blendon said. “This is the only survey that has ever asked physicians broadly what they felt about the law.”
But the study’s researchers also acknowledged that the reform’s positive results have come with “trade-offs,” including administrative burdens and higher costs. About 50 percent of the physicians polled said they believed the law was “hurting” the overall cost of health care in Massachusetts.

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation last night that would overhaul the student group recognition process, creating a joint student-faculty committee comprised equally of students and administrators that will approve new student organizations.
The legislation, entitled the “Student Organization Recognition Act,” amends UC bylaws to place the responsibility of approving new student groups in the hands of the Student Organization Recognition Board, which will have significant UC membership.
The Board will consist of eight UC members—the UC President and Vice President, the Chair and Vice Chair of the Student Relations Committee, and four SRC members. The remainder of the Board will comprise eight College administrators, three from the Office of Student Life and five from Harvard institutions—such as the Phillips Brooks House Association and o specific goals of different student groups.
“This is the first time in the UC’s history that we’re putting a foundation for a student-faculty committee that does a very important task in the UC’s bylaws,” said Eric N. Hysen ’11, chair of the Rules Committee and a member of the Crimson IT Board. “It’s a very important precedent for how the UC can be involved in governing student life.”
UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10 said that the new structure will give the UC “institutional legitimacy.”
“Putting students responsible for the growth of their extracurricular life is incredibly empowering,” she said.
The reforms were created to address what was seen as an inefficiency in the student-group approval process. Previously, the student-faculty Committee on College Life, which met monthly, spent “an inordinate amount of time” sorting through student group applications, said Paul J. McLoughlin II, Assistant Dean of the College.
According to UC Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12, the change in bylaws also allows those seeking to form student groups a chance to advocate for themselves more thoroughly.
The legislation passed unanimously, but one source of contention was whether to restrict student membership on the Student Organization Recognition Board solely to members of SRC.
SRC Chair Daniel V. Kroop ’10 argued that the SRC was the appropriate body to oversee student group approval because of its role as liaison to the student body. This role would help “the committee stay relevant as a focal point of interaction between students and the UC,” he said.
UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 proposed an amendment that would require one member of the UC Finance Committee to sit in on Board meetings as a non-voting member in order to give FiCom a glimpse of the “bigger picture” of student groups.
This recent amendment passed on the heels of an unsuccessful one proposed by Mallika Khandelwal ’11, chair of the Student Initiatives Committee, that would have replaced one SRC member on the Board with a voting member of the FiCom.
In addition, the UC approved legislation last night that would partner the Committee with Harvard Student Agencies to provide shuttle service to and from Yale during the Harvard-Yale Football Game. The UC also supported creation of a new ad hoc student committee to discuss education and other topics such as financial aid for students.

Plummer Professor of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes underwent a heart pacemaker surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital on Friday after stumbling from severe dizziness while delivering a talk in upstate New York on Wednesday.
Gomes, 67, suffered from a sudden bout of dizziness and light-headedness while speaking at St. Lawrence University and subsequently lost his balance on stage, according to Rev. Jonathan C. Page ’02, Epps Fellow at Memorial Church. Gomes was immediately taken to a hospital near the university that night.
On Thursday, he was transferred to Mass. General and examined by cardiologists, who determined that a sudden drop in blood pressure had caused Gomes’ faintness, according to Page.
The next day, doctors inserted an artificial pacemaker into Gomes’ heart. The devise sends electrical signals to the heart in order to regulate the heart rate and maintain constant blood pressure in the body. The pacemaker will hopefully help to relieve Gomes’ sensations of dizziness, according to Page, who also noted that the procedure went smoothly.
“If all goes well, [Gomes] should be released from the hospital in the next few days. He’ll probably be taking it easy, and I don’t know when he will come back fully to work,” said Page, who visited the Pusey Minister at the hospital on Saturday. “The good news is that he seems to be doing very well, and hopefully he’ll be back to his normal self in no time.”
Gomes, who was appointed professor and minister at Memorial Church in 1974, has been a quintessential presence at Harvard for decades. He hosts a weekly Wednesday Tea at Sparks House, the residence across from Memorial Hall in which he lives alone. It is unclear whether he will be well enough to attend this week.
Page said that Gomes welcomes any flowers or cards sent to his home at 21 Kirkland St.

In a move that brought clarity to why administrators have tamed fiscal messages after months of stressing the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ impending financial deficit, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith delivered the news Friday that the school had posted a $58.6 million surplus in its unrestricted funds for the fiscal year that closed in June 2009.
The figure, released on Friday in Smith’s Dean’s Annual Report, was balanced by a consistent emphasis that most of the gains were “the result of one-time events,” and that, as expected, much remains to be done to close a remaining $110 million deficit.
Still, Smith noted that FAS received about $33 million in unrestricted gifts from two anonymous donors this past year, while also making a strategic withdrawal of $20 million in cash from its endowment to help offset the increased costs of the middle-income financial aid initiative.
Both funding sources represent isolated influxes into the annual budget, and will not be reported in subsequent years, meaning that the long-term deficit situation that Smith emphasized in a series of faculty meetings and community gatherings remains a concern.
But Smith wrote in his report that the “positive results from [Fiscal Year] ’09 allow us more time to implement...strategies so that we can bring our finances back into balance.”
In the meantime, it appeared Friday that Smith’s calls for cost-cutting measures last spring—when deficit estimates ran as high as $220 million over a two-year period—had paid some dividends.
In addition to the one-time injections of cash in the last fiscal year, FAS achieved a small unrestricted surplus from various savings measures—allowing FAS to grow its reserves by $58.6 million.
These savings included reductions in the amount of unrestricted sums—known as subventions—that are distributed to major FAS units, as well as lower costs associated with faculty recruitment and relocation, which appeared to follow from a Smith letter last December that announced a sudden, severe slowdown in searches for new faculty.
The additional savings also included reductions in utility rates and consumption in buildings that were aided by reduced hiring, which led to lower occupancy rates in the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering and the Northwest Science Building.
FAS also pocketed about $12 million in additional revenues from various funding sources such as Extension School tuition—more than budgeted for the last fiscal year.
At an open forum in September, Smith first informed faculty and staff that progress had been made on the University’s financial situation which had led him to prescribe cost-cutting measures that went “significantly further” than the “proverbial belt tightening,” as he wrote in a correspondence to the Faculty last year.
Speaking before an audience in the Science Center, Smith mentioned the anonymous gifts and told forum attendees that thanks to a combination of windfalls and budget trimming, the current fiscal year had seen its deficit already slashed by over $100 million from earlier projections.
In the report, Smith wrote that the administration should avoid spending all of the surplus accrued over the last fiscal year, and stressed the importance of aggressive fundraising, especially for unrestricted, current-use funds. He also reiterated what has become a continual note of caution—that FAS should be careful to only hire faculty and staff with the assurance of long-term funding.
FAS must whittle down its expenses after the endowment lost $11 billion—30 percent of its value—this past year. The Harvard Corporation slashed its endowment distribution to FAS by 8 percent for the fiscal year ending July 2010, and is planning to cut another 12 percent the year after, University President Drew G. Faust said at an October Faculty meeting.
“I am reminded daily of how enviable our intellectual resources are. These resources demand an intensified commitment to...a better understanding of our academic identity,” Smith wrote in the report. “Like a bridle for Pegasus, the result of such commitment will help us harness our financial and administrative resources to better serve our academic mission.”
The Dean’s Annual Report completes FAS’ official financial records from Feb. 2008—the endpoint of the last report—through June 2009. Instead of releasing the Annual Report nine months or more after the end of a fiscal year, Smith said he will now publish the report every October to detail the most recently closed fiscal year.

The first ever Boston Book Festival attracted thousands of people to Copley Square this Saturday to listen to panels, participate in workshops, and flip through books of all genres.
Event organizers said that the event was intended to celebrate “the power of words and ideas in a city that has a long history of innovation and creativity,” and featured a multitude of internationally-known authors and artists, including filmmaker Ken Burns, comedian John Hodgman of Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show,” and Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk.
Several Harvard affiliates were also featured as presenters at the event, which highlighted different forms of literature.
Hollis Research Professor of Divinity Harvey G. Cox, who brought a cow to the Tercentenary Theater earlier this year in celebration of his retirement, spoke about the role of religion a society that suffers from “cultural attention deficit syndrome”.
“I think that faith is a basic, irrefutable human need,” he said. “You can’t live without it.”
Bret A. Johnston, the University’s director of creative writing, hosted the “Ties that Bind” panel, and focused the discussion on the role of the family in novels.
“[Stories about families] will probably be the last stories we ever write,” he said. “They are stories that arrest, sustain and reward the reader time and time again.”
Deborah Z. Porter, the festival’s founding president, said in an interview that she began preparing for the event after learning that Boston was “the only major U.S. city that did not have an annual book festival.”
The event took more than two years to organize, she said.
Panels were held in the Boston Public Library and booths for the festival’s sponsors were featured outside in Copley Square.
She added that she wanted to concentrate the day’s events in one central location.
“[The book fair in New York City] was all over town,” she said. “I wanted a center and a heart to the festival...one that has an outdoor component to it.”
Justin M. Levine, a volunteer at the inaugural festival, said that he was impressed by the organization of the day.
“For the first time, they’re doing an amazing job,” he said. “The different types of panels, the different authors they’re bringing in...it’s a fantastic thing.”
People who attended the event said that the festival did a good job of bringing together booklovers of all ages.
“[Reading] is like an escape from the real world,” said Danny D. Gottschalk, a graduate of Suffolk University. “The more you read...the more you get educated.”

Drinking four glasses of alcoholic beverages a week can significantly reduce a woman’s chances of becoming pregnant through in vitro fertilization, a recent study conducted by researchers at the Harvard Medical School suggests. The study was headed by Dr. Brooke V. Rossi, a clinical fellow in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Biology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Rossi and fellow researchers surveyed over 2,500 couples attempting to have a baby through IVF, comparing survey results from those couples who regularly drank alcohol to those who did not.
Rossi’s group concluded that increased alcohol consumption in both men and women strongly decreased the likelihood of a woman’s egg being successfully fertilized.
Consuming more than four drinks per week can reduce the chance of conception by 18 percent for women and 14 percent for men. In couples where both the man and woman drink up to four drinks a week, chances of conception are reduced by 26 percent—“a huge decrease,” according to Rossi.
The effects of alcohol consumption on successful pregnancy were most pronounced in women who drink four units of white wine per week and in men who drink the same amount of beer.
According to Rossi, although her research team discovered a correlation between alcohol consumption and decreased probability of pregnancy through IVF, they are still unclear about what leads to this decreased likelihood.
“This is not an epidemiologic study, so we can’t comment on what’s happening at a biological level,” Rossi said. “Based on a few animal studies, it might have something to do with the spindle of the egg.”
Though it is no surprise that alcohol consumption during pregnancy has a detrimental impact on fetal development, Rossi said she could not yet comment on the different effects alcohol has on women impregnated through in vitro versus women impregnated through sexual intercourse.
“We are now trying to analyze data to see if there are any specific differences in the cycle, egg number, sperm quality, that could contribute to these findings,” Rossi said.

The Boston Bike Film Festival, which featured 14 non-fiction films that celebrate cycling culture, attracted approximately 200 people to the Brattle Theatre this weekend.
The festival, which also included a silent auction, was organized by Cat M. Bryant, who started the event in 2005 as a means to raise awareness about cycling. Profits from the event will be donated to local cycling advocacy groups such as Hub on Wheels and MassBike.
“We’re trying to attract a lot of attention to biking and make people think of it less as spandex-clad speedsters and more as a way to get around,” said David M. Watson, executive director for MassBike.
“Some of the big issues of our time—economic issues, environmental issues, social issues and health issues—can be impacted by cycling,” he said.
MassBike, which played a pivotal role in publicizing the festival, also supplied volunteers to staff the silent auction and serve food at the event.
The program, which screened over Friday and Saturday nights, consisted mostly of documentaries but also included one rap video. The selections had been submitted online by independent directors.
“They’re sort of low-budget, avant-garde films,” said Everett Briggs, a cyclist who attended the event for the first time last year.
Several directors whose work was featured in the festival were present to introduce their films in person.
John S. Allen, the director of “Grand Street,” a short film that shows bicyclists riding down the controversial Grand Street bicycle lane in New York City, which separates cyclists from traffic with a row of parked cars. The film was shot in one take, using cameras in front of and behind the two cyclists.
“The purpose I had in shooting was to be analytical. It is helpful for us in Boston to look at how things are done in other cities,” Allen said.
In addition to showcasing films about cycling, the festival also serves as a social event for bike enthusiasts in the local area.
“I think of it as a way to get the Boston bike community together again as the season winds down,” said Ellen Gugel, a board member of the Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition who volunteered at the festival.
“There’s a really active cycling community in Boston that has grown over the past years,” said Randy A. Stern, a festival attendee who is also an employee of the Harvard University Library. “This festival tends to attract the activists, but the event really engenders community [among all cyclists].”

CORRECTION APPENDED
Six Harvard Medical School researchers were poisoned in August after drinking contaminated coffee, according to a memorandum released by HMS officials last Friday.
Tainted coffee sent the six researchers to Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center on August 26 with symptoms ranging from dizziness and fainting to ringing in the ears, according to the Associated Press.
HMS spokesman David J. Cameron said that contracted toxicologists found sodium azide, a chemical used in air bags and laboratory preservatives, in samples of the victims’ coffee and in the water tank of a coffee machine in the New Research Building in Boston.
The memo, which was authored by HMS Executive Dean of Administration Daniel G. Ennis and Associate Dean for Physical Planning and Facilities Richard M. Shea, confirmed the presence of sodium azide in the coffee machine.
Mabel P. Duyao, director of research at the HMS Pathology Department, said that sodium azide is used in laboratories—including the 8th floor pathology lab at the New Research Building—to protect solutions from bacteria and other microorganisms.
According to Cameron, how the chemical wound up in the machine is still under investigation by the Harvard University Police Department and that they have yet to form a concrete theory about what happened.
One victim told the Boston Herald that they believed the poisoning was not an accident. Duyao said that such a theory cannot be ruled out, and that the main focus of the police investigation was to determine whether there was a motive behind the incident.
“We don’t know if it was accidental or if it was done out of malice,” she said. “That’s really what we’re trying to get out of this investigation.”
Since the August incident, additional cameras have been installed in the pathology lab, the HMS memo states.
According to Duyao, the first researcher checked into Beth Israel around 9 a.m., and all six were admitted to the hospital by 4 p.m. Five of the six were released the same day, and the sixth checked out the following morning.
HMS refused to release names or details about the affected researchers, but The Herald identified two of the six victims, doctoral student Lidia Bosurgi and research fellow Matteo Iannacone. Both refused to speak with The Herald last week, citing a request from Harvard that they refrain from media interviews.
Cameron said that this restriction was intended to give HMS time to contact all of the victims and that as of last Friday, the six were free to talk to the press.
“When the chemical compound or agent was identified, HMS leadership wanted to talk to each victim individually and tell them what it was,” Cameron said. “When they talked to [the victims], they said, ‘Until we talk to each of the six people individually, please don’t talk to anyone about the chemical.’”
HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano declined to comment. Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel F. Conley, said that the office was aware of the case but that no charges have been filed.

Harvard was most dangerous on Saturday each time Princeton’s punt unit took the field. The danger came not from the Crimson’s return game, which managed only five yards on three attempts, but from the Tigers’ self-inflicted struggles.
“The punt team part of our special teams had been our most consistent,” Princeton coach Roger Hughes said. “To see that go down was very disappointing.”
The circus began on the Tigers’ first punt of the day. A low snap from Princeton long snapper JP Makrai skidded past punter Joe Cloud and rolled toward the goal line. After Cloud recovered the ball, senior linebacker Nick Hasselberg delivered a crushing hit that caused another fumble. Although Princeton recovered the loose ball, the turnover on downs gave Harvard possession at the three-yard line, and it converted for a score on the very next play.
“It seemed like JP [Makrai] and Joe [Cloud] were having bad days, and, for whatever reason, they weren’t doing whatever they normally do,” Hughes said.
The early turnover forced Hughes to change his personnel as Jason Tiemeier replaced Makrai at long-snapper.
But the results were more of the same. Midway through the second quarter, another bounced snap caused Cloud to rush his punt, which traveled only 25 yards.
Backed up in its own end of the field with only 43 seconds remaining, the Princeton punt unit struck again.
This time, Harvard senior defensive back JB Monu broke through the line, blocked Cloud’s punt, and sophomore linebacker Alex Gedeon recovered the ball at the 21-yard line. The turnover led to a Crimson field goal to close out the half.
Although Otavio Fluery replaced Cloud in the second half, he shanked a 10-yard punt at the end of the third quarter to cap off a miserable day for the Tigers’ special teams.
“I don’t think [the game] got away [on the first possession],” Hughes said. “It was more the mistakes on special teams.”
GROUND GAME
With rainy conditions throughout the afternoon, the Harvard offense attacked on the ground. Nine players carried the ball a combined 53 times for a total of 267 yards, roughly five yards per carry.
“[Crimson coach Tim Murphy], this week during practice, emphasized establishing the run, saying that if we want to be successful we have to run the ball,” said junior running back Gino Gordon.
Gordon gained the lion’s share of the Crimson’s yardage with 84 yards and a touchdown on nine carries. His biggest play came with Harvard leading, 14-3, midway through the first half. Facing third-and-15 on the Princeton 22-yard line, junior quarterback Collier Winters handed the ball off the Gordon, who raced towards first-down marker on the left sideline. A late burst of speed garnered enough yardage to move the chains, leading to another Crimson touchdown.
Protecting a lead in the second half, Harvard kept to the ground. In one sequence, the Crimson gave senior running back Cheng Ho carries on 9 consecutive plays. Ho finished with 73 yards on 12 carries. Freshman running back Treavor Scales rounded out the top three rushers with 59 yards on 10 rushes.
“All the running backs, Cheng, Treavor, and I, we ran hard and that was a big part of our success overall,” Gordon said.
SOMETHING LEFT TO BE DESIRED
Although Harvard put up a season-high in points on Saturday, it could have scored even more.
With 1:43 remaining in the second quarter, the Crimson had the ball at the Tigers’ six-yard line. Winters took the snap and rolled to his right, trying to find an open receiver.
With a lineman in his face, Winters lofted a pass to the right corner of the end zone, where Princeton cornerback John Callahan picked off an easy interception and ended the threat.
Earlier that same drive, Harvard executed a nifty trick play. Senior wide receiver Mike Cook got the ball from the running back on a reverse and, rolling to his right, threw a perfect pass downfield to senior wide receiver Matt Luft. Luft sauntered into the end zone for an apparent touchdown, but a penalty, due to an ineligible receiver downfield, took the points off the board.
“The goal isn’t just to win. It’s to play to your full potential,” Murphy said.  “As happy as we are beating a rival, getting a good win, still in control of our own destiny in the league, we still made too many mistakes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of Ivy League football this year has been about unpredictability. With no stacked lineups or breakout superstars, almost any matchup could be anybody’s game. Brown quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero outdueling Patriot League god Dominic Randolph? Columbia holding Princeton scoreless in a 38-0 blowout? Yale having the league’s best scoring defense—and a sub-.500 conference record?
At this point, nothing in Ancient Eight football should surprise me. But on Saturday, something did.
The one exception to this league of unpredictability has been Dartmouth. Before Saturday, the Big Green had lost 17 games in a row. Last season, Dartmouth wasn’t within a touchdown of winning any of its games.
Columbia rolled into Hanover on Saturday looking to rebound from a tough loss at the hands of league frontrunner Penn. And instead of sending the Big Green tumbling to its 18th-straight loss, something went horribly wrong.
Dartmouth scored first. It opened up a 14-0 lead at halftime. And the Big Green won the game, 28-6.
Safe to say, even with a win under its belt, Dartmouth won’t be challenging anybody for the Ivy crown. But it’s also safe to say that upstart Columbia shouldn’t be included in any more discussions of the Ancient Eight’s upper echelon.
With just four games remaining to decide this year’s Ivy champion, the field has been narrowed to a three-horse race. It’s the only teams with a winning league record—undefeated Harvard and Penn and 2-1 Brown—who can still make a run at the crown.
The Bears’ one Ivy loss came under the lights at Harvard Stadium, a 24-22 decision in which Brown was throwing for the winning touchdown in the final three plays.
Since then, Newhall has emerged as the best quarterback in the league, completing 65 percent of his passes for 13 touchdowns and an average of 290 yards a game—though he does lead the league in interceptions (10) as well.
Of course, it helps that Newhall has the best receiver in the Ivy League to throw to. Senior Buddy Farnham hauled in touchdown passes of 48 and 56 yards in a win at Cornell on Saturday, padding his Ivy Player of the Year resume.
Brown, like the Crimson, gets three mediocre teams—Yale, Columbia and still-dismal Dartmouth—in its final four games. But its biggest test will come next weekend, when Brown welcomes Penn to Providence.
Among the top trio, the Quakers have the meat of their schedule still to play. The comeback win over the Lions has boosted Penn’s credibility after it beat Dartmouth by only six points in the league opener.
But the Quakers must go on the road to face Harvard and the Bears—no easy task.
Penn’s defense is outstanding, and that was on full display Saturday in a 9-0 win at Yale, where the only touchdown was a first-quarter interception return.
Because of their defensive prowess, the Quakers present an interesting matchup for the offensively-minded Crimson and Brown teams.
Penn leads the league in both rush and pass defense, but it will be going head to head with the Ancient Eight’s best rush (Harvard) and pass (Brown) offenses.
With a stalemate on one side of the field, what these games will come down to is how well the Crimson and Bears can stifle the Quaker offense. Penn’s got the worst passing attack in the Ivies, averaging under 130 yards a game. But it’s second behind Harvard in rushing offense, and the team that can figure out how to stop the Quaker ground assault—led by Lyle Marsh—is the team that has a shot to take Penn down.
I think it’s the Crimson that has the best chance. The Quakers have the ability to get in Newhall’s head, while Harvard’s capable of playing a balanced game on offense, even if it’s struggled to do so thus far.
And when the Crimson’s defense is on, it’s on. The team faced off against the third-best rushing offense on Saturday and held Princeton to just 38 yards on the ground. But to take down Penn—or Dartmouth, Columbia or Yale, for that matter—Harvard has to execute.
The Crimson seems to have the clearest path to the Ivy crown at this point. All it has to do is keep winning—unlike Brown, which needs both of the unbeatens to lose—and its toughest remaining game comes at home. If it can solve the Quakers, Harvard just has to beat the stumbling Bulldogs to take the title outright.
But this is the Ivy League in 2009, and anything can happen. Just ask Columbia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It only took a minute and a half for the Harvard football team to begin erasing the bitter memory of last week’s loss to Lafayette.
In Saturday’s contest against Princeton (1-5, 0-3 Ivy), the Crimson (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) used three plays in its first drive—a pair of one-yard rushes and a 77-yard bomb from junior quarterback Collier Winters to classmate Chris Lorditch—to tack seven points on the board, en route to a 37-3 drubbing of the Tigers.
The funny thing is, according to Harvard coach Tim Murphy, the offense wasn’t even the highlight of Saturday’s game.
“It was overall, just a very solid team effort across the board: special teams, defense, offense—in that order,” Murphy said.
Though Princeton responded on its opening possession with a 58-yard drive—culminating in a field goal from the Harvard two-yard line—that would be the Tigers’ only redzone threat. Princeton crossed into Harvard territory only three more times in the game.
“They came out and moved the ball very well, and I think holding them to three on that drive was a morale builder for us,” Murphy said
And then the special teams unit took over.
On the Tigers’ second possession, a botched snap dribbled down to the Princeton three-yard line, and though the Tigers’ Brad Stetler managed to recover it, Harvard took over on the turnover on downs.
“The best part of our special teams to this point had been our punting,” Princeton coach Phil Hughes said. “And it was disappointing that we didn’t handle the snap, and the snap was not as good as it could have been. And that gave them field position early and easy field position early. And against good teams like Harvard, we can’t do that.”
The Crimson punched in the score on a short completion from Winters to rookie tight end Kyle Juszczyk, who finished the day with three receptions—good for 27 yards.
“He’s 6’3, 245, and he’s another one of those guys that we thought while recruiting, ‘Wow, this kid might be able to help us as a freshman,’” Murphy said of Juszczyk. “Usually when you say that, it’s the kiss of death, but since he’s got here, the transition has been a very smooth one.”
Harvard posted two more scores to close out the first half—a touchdown coming from a rush by Winters and a 23-yard field goal by senior Patrick Long in the waning seconds of the second frame.
Winters finished the day passing 13-of-19 for 190 yards with two picks and two TDs. He also added 26 net rushing yards on the day with a touchdown.
The running back platoon of junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales rushed for 84 and 59 yards, respectively.
After Gordon punched in a touchdown from three yards out late in the third quarter to give the Crimson a comfortable 31-3 lead, Harvard brought in some of its third and fouth stringers. Freshman Colton Chapple and junior Matt Simpson both spent time under center in the fourth quarter, and senior Cheng Ho—who is third on the running back depth chart—managed a team-second 73 yards on just 12 carries and a touchdown in his limited play in the fourth quarter.
“I think a lot of the credit today—taking nothing away from the running backs—is that the offensive line played extremely well,” Murphy said. “I mean, we always say it’s what’s up front that counts on both sides of the ball, and if you control the line of scrimmage, you’re going to win a lot of games. And if you don’t—and we didn’t last week—then you’re in trouble.”
Defensively, Harvard contained a Princeton offense that has been struggling all season. The Tigers average 269 total offensive yards per game compared to their opponents’ 388 yards. Saturday was no different, as Princeton mustered only 157 yards compared with the Crimson’s 457.
A large part of the Tigers’ offensive misgivings this season has resulted from Jordan Culbreath’s recent diagnosis of aplastic anemia. Culbreath has 1551 career rushing yards and has been lynchpin of the Princeton offense in recent years.
But with Culbreath out, the Harvard D had little difficulty controlling the pace of the game.
“They prepared well for us last year, they ran all over us, and we made it a point as a defense to get in and make sure we prepare well, make sure we come out and play it well, all out, leave everything on the field,” said senior linebacker Jon Takamura, who led the defense with eight tackles, including four solo and one for a loss.
But as much as the Crimson had everything clicking on Saturday, Murphy still expects more from his team.
“As happy as we are beating a rival, getting a good win, being still in control of our own destiny in the league, we still made too many mistakes,” Murphy said. “We play like a young team sometimes, and we can get away with that maybe in the first couple of games as an alibi, but there’s no excuses for it. We’ve got to tighten things up. We’ve got a long way to go as far as I’m concerned.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The cheers from Harvard bench had scarcely subsided when, suddenly, the ball was in the Crimson net, and the cheers were coming from the opposing team.
If this theme sounds familiar, that’s because it is—for the second game in a row, Harvard scored to pull ahead and surrendered its lead minutes afterward.
In the Crimson’s mid-week matchup against Providence, Harvard was able to claim victory anyway, but against Princeton (7-5-2, 2-2) on Saturday, the setback was more costly. No. 9 Harvard (10-3-1, 2-1-1 Ivy) could not score again in regulation and surrendered the game-winning goal in the second overtime to lose to the Tigers, 2-1.
“It’s disappointing,” said second-year head coach Jamie Clark. “It’s one of those things that becomes unacceptable when you’ve done it twice in a row.”
The upset threatens the Crimson’s Ivy League championship chances—Dartmouth has a 3-0 record, so Harvard must count on both winning the remainder of their Ivy League matchups and the Big Green dropping points to another conference team.
The loss came as a huge disappointment for both coaches and players.
“We could’ve played better,” Clark said. “I don’t think we connected a pass in probably 55 minutes. We thought we had to win, and we kind of lost composure to pass the ball. [Princeton] did too, to be honest. It just became an ugly fight.”
Another factor was the conditions, for a rainy Saturday morning left Ohiri Field a slippery mess for both teams.
“[The rain] didn’t help the quality of play,” Clark said. “But you have to be able to play in pockets, and we didn’t find pockets to play in.”
The game was back and forth for the first half, with few good chances for either team. But in the 66th minute, co-captain Andre Akpan broke away and was tripped by the Tigers’ goalie in the box. On the ensuing penalty kick, Akpan wrong-footed the keeper and calmly slotted the ball into the bottom left corner.
“The goalkeeper made contact,” Clark said of the foul call. “Good forwards drag their legs to ensure contact, and if there’s contact that’s a foul.”
Akpan’s tenth goal of the season leaves him two away from the Harvard record, but the excitement was short-lived. A mere 20 seconds later, Princeton infiltrated the Crimson defense and knocked the ball into the Harvard net.
“The ball just kind of slipped through,” senior defender Kwaku Nyamekye said. “We were kind of caught off guard.”
While the Crimson defense, and Nyamekye in particular, did a good job of containing the Tigers for the rest of regulation, Harvard could not put together anything of its own.
“Certain plays we didn’t capitalize on,” Nyamekye said. “At the end of the day, it just comes down to one or two plays.”
In the 102nd minute, Princeton headed in a well-placed cross from the left to win the game, shocking the Parents’ Day crowd and handing Harvard its first Ivy League defeat.
“We knew it was going to be a set piece that won it,” Clark said. “In the first [overtime], we created quite a few chances, and they made the most of their chances in the second overtime period.”
Set pieces have been a problem for the Crimson the whole season. While Harvard has the physical potential to be a dominant team in the air, it has only scored one goal all year from a set piece.
For a team that was 5-1 in one-goal games, the failure under pressure was uncharacteristic.
“[If] you play enough close games…you lose some,” Clark said. “Odds are if you go into overtime enough times, you’re not going to win them all, and that’s our reality right now.”
That reality leaves the Crimson in a must-win situation against Dartmouth next weekend.
“We need to really start preparing for Dartmouth, thinking about Dartmouth, not dwelling on this loss but keeping this in the back of our minds,” Nyamekye said. “We’re going to train hard this week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The “hard-fought game,” as sports fans tend to visualize it, takes place in the rain, on a muddy field. It’s fierce and physical with star players getting knocked around and fans heckling the refs and opposing players. The two teams relentlessly attack each other’s goal, often to no avail, until the very last second. One play, quick and unexpected, decides the game.
The Harvard women’s soccer team’s (7-6-1, 4-1 Ivy) 1-0 loss to Princeton (6-6-3, 2-2-1 Ivy) on Saturday at Ohiri Field had all of these features. The deciding tally came from Tiger freshman Jen Hoy, who scored with less than five minutes to play.
“You definitely got your money’s worth coming to this one,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said.
Harvard came out charging early and seemed to dominate possession for much of the first half but was unable to capitalize. Junior Katherine Sheeleigh and sophomore Melanie Baskind were able to put pressure on the Tiger defense and goalie Alyssa Pont, but Princeton was able to thwart the Crimson’s offensive plans. The Tigers were able to clear the ball after Sheeleigh set up a scramble in front of the goal and were able to force wide shots by Baskind and senior Christina Hagner.
“I think in the first half, especially, we had a lot of chances to put it away,” Baskind said. “You’ve got to punish them in the moment, [or] it’ll definitely come back and get you.”
Princeton, meanwhile, was struggling for much of the half to get its offense going and to get Hoy involved.
“We have six or seven freshmen on the field,” Princeton coach Julie Shackford said. “From game to game, we don’t often know which ones are going to step up...at the end of the day, [Hoy is] our most dangerous in terms of getting behind people, putting defenders on their heels, that kind of stuff.”
The Tigers seemed to find their fire towards the end of the first half, outshooting the Crimson, 4-1, in the last 10 minutes of the half. Princeton carried that intensity into the second half and dominated the ball just as Harvard had done for much of the first half.
The second half was decidedly rougher than the first. Trying to clear the ball out of the box, co-captain Lizzy Nichols took what looked to be an elbow to the nose and was escorted off the field with a towel to her face at 73:58.
But the senior plugged up her nose and went back in the game at 76:38. A minute later, Nichols got a shot off.
The next shot of the game came from Baskind, and it looked as if the Crimson was regaining its control of the game.
But the thing about soccer is that one play can change everything.
“It definitely had a feel that it was a one-goal game,” Leone said.
That play came from Hoy. The freshman beat Harvard defenders freshman Taryn Kurcz and sophomore Lindsey Kowal down the field and drilled the ball past senior goalie Lauren Mann to the lower right corner at 85:10.
“Jen’s got the speed to get behind people,” Shackford said. “[She] hasn’t finished a goal like that all season, so it couldn’t have come at a better time.”
If the Crimson was frustrated with the play, it didn’t show it, bouncing right back. Nichols rallied her teammates and got off her second shot of the day at 86:00. Shortly after, junior co-captain Gina Wideroff took a shot, which Pont deflected out of bounds, giving Kowal a corner kick. Freshman Caroline Albanese tried to capitalize out of a one-on-one with a Princeton defender but was unsuccessful.
“I was really proud of them,” Leone said. “How they did in the last four minutes was amazing [because] you could fold up thinking there’s not enough time, but there’s always time. If there’s a second, there’s time.”
And in the last second, Albanese nearly changed everything. But Pont was barely able to get a hand on her shot at 89:59 and the ball went over the right corner of the goal, giving Princeton its first road shutout of Harvard since 1985.
“I thought [Albanese’s shot] was going to go in,” Leone said. “And it was a good save, it was close. I’m just more proud of how we were even able to take that shot. You can’t control everything. The only thing you can control is giving it all you’ve got, and they did, and that’s what I was appreciative of.”
After the loss, Harvard—which had gained sole control of the Ivy League in its Tuesday win against Yale—will need to win its final regular season games against Dartmouth and Columbia to stay in the title hunt. The Crimson was in the same situation last year after losing its Ivy opener to Penn.
“The way we responded last year was unbelievable,” Baskind said. “We know it’s in us.”
“We need this challenge,” Nichols added. “I feel sorry for Dartmouth next week [because] we’re going to come out on fire.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the last three minutes of Harvard field hockey’s matchup with Princeton, it looked as if the scoreboard at Jordan Field might need a few extra lights. But thankfully for the scorekeeper, the Tigers attack halted before it could reach double-digits.
Playing in a light drizzle before a crowd sporting as much orange as crimson, No. 4 Princeton handed the home team its worst loss of the season, 9-0.
“Their speed of execution was something we couldn’t keep up with [Saturday],” Harvard coach Sue Caples said.
The Crimson (5-8, 2-3 Ivy), which failed to register a shot throughout the first half, was outshot by the Tigers 33-1.
“We obviously didn’t play necessarily strongly,” said junior forward Chloe Keating, who leads the Harvard offense in scoring this season.
With Saturday’s victory, Princeton (12-2, 5-0) increased its lead in the Ivy League to one and a half games over second-place Yale heading into the final two weeks of conference play. 	Senior midfielder Kaitlin Donovan, who failed to score in her team’s first 13 games, led the Tigers with three first-half goals. Princeton struck early and often, registering four goals in the game’s first 16 minutes.
Donovan got things started for the Tigers in the fifth minute, receiving a pass off a penalty corner just inside the semi-circle before firing it to the left of Crimson goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos.
Tassopoulos, who entered Saturday’s contest after her first career shutout against Cornell, allowed nine goals, just two fewer than she allowed in Harvard’s first four Ancient Eight games combined.
Nearly three minutes after Princeton’s first score, Alyssa Pyros batted a shot into the air above the glove of Tassopoulos for her first goal of the game. Pyros struck again two minutes later, this time keeping the ball on the ground as it rolled into the right side of the net, giving the Tigers the commanding 3-0 lead.  On Princeton’s third penalty corner in the 16th minute, Donovan got her second score, this time off a pass from Katie Reinprecht.
Keating tried to get the Crimson offense going, leading a charge in the game’s 10th minute. After juking past a duo of Tiger defenders, Keating made her way into the semi-circle before the ball was knocked away from her by Princeton’s swarming defense.
“[The Tigers] are very fast. They have great individual speed and team speed,” Caples said. “They’re just an outstanding team.”
The Harvard offense, which was plagued throughout the game by bad passing and aggressive pressuring from the Princeton defense, failed to come up with another scoring opportunity in the half.
Solid play from the Crimson defense for the game’s next 19 minutes kept the Tigers stuck at four goals. But just as things were starting to look up for Harvard heading into the break, Princeton scored with 29 seconds remaining.
Donovan netted her hat trick, this time off a cross from Katlyn Perrelle that set her up with an open shot in front of the goal before the buzzer sounded.
“We kind of came out flat, and they really buried us in the first half,” Keating said.
The Tigers kept up pressure in the second half, scoring just 46 seconds into the start of the period. The Tigers’ final total of nine goals marked its highest offensive output of the season.
“Princeton is an outstanding team [with] tremendous athleticism,” Caples said. “There’s a reason why they’re ranked fourth in the country.”
Knowing it faced a talented offense, the Crimson hoped to slow the Princeton attack by adjusting its formation to concentrate on the Tiger’s high-powered midfielders.
“Our goal was to stop them early before they could get into our 25 to limit shots on goal,” Tassopoulos said. “I think that we came out and didn’t really execute the game plan against Princeton.”
Despite allowing nine scores, the Crimson was able to hold Princeton’s leading scorer, Kathleen Sharkey, with a blank sheet. Sharkey, who entered the contest leading the Ivy League averaging one goal per game, finished with just two shot attempts.
On the other side of the field, Harvard hoped to get the ball inside the semi-circle to come away with penalty corners, but the Crimson had a difficult time controlling the ball. Harvard finished the contest with a single penalty corner, compared to the eight taken by the Tigers.
With just four games remaining in its season, the Crimson will need to finish undefeated if it hopes to come away with a winning record, both in the Ivy League and overall.
“We know now what it’s going to take to finish out the season,” Tassopoulos said. “We only have four more games left, and you have to stay mentally prepared through [the end] of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the warm rain outside was a memory that it’s still fall in Cambridge, fans of Harvard women’s hockey got their first taste of winter Saturday afternoon.
The Crimson took the ice against collegiate competition for the first time this year, defeating McGill, 4-1, in exhibition action at Bright Hockey Center.
Co-captain Kathryn Farni led the team with her four-point effort and six Harvard rookies made their Crimson debut.
“We learned a lot this week,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “I was most impressed with the increase in effort over last weekend[’s scrimmage]. Part of the challenge of having a young team is getting them to work hard and to understand that they’re capable of more than they think they are—and that was good.”
Farni, a defenseman, set the tone for the Crimson with a first-period shorthanded goal.
Near the end of the Martlets’ first power play, Farni intercepted a pass in the neutral zone and found open ice, charging forward to slip the puck inside the right post.
“You could kind of tell that she was looking to pass far side,” Farni said of her steal. “I got lucky, I guess. She did what I thought she was going to do, and there wasn’t anybody between me and the goalie, so I had a chance to put it in.”
Harvard doubled its lead with 8:30 to play in the first period. Rookie center Jillian Dempsey won a faceoff, passing the puck off to Farni.
The co-captain connected with junior Kate Buesser, who was waiting between the circles. Buesser launched a high slapshot that found the top left corner of the net.
“Buess is just a great kid—she’ll put the puck away if you get it on her stick, and same with Katharine [Chute],” Farni said. “They’re both big, strong skaters, and if they have the chance in front of the net, they’ll put it away.”
Farni went on to orchestrate Harvard’s third goal as well, which lit the lamp at 6:21 in the second. The blueliner sent a shot in from the outside, and Buesser was waiting in front of the net to slam the rebound past McGill netminder Taylor Salisbury.
“[Farni’s] playing with confidence, and she’s picking her spots of when to jump into the offense,” Stone said. “But one of the big things is that she got her shots through today, and that was the key to three assists also.”
In a 3-0 hole, the Martlets were not discouraged, and with under seven minutes to go in the second frame, McGill found an opportunity in transition.
Martlet captain Vanessa Davidson got the puck on her stick at the top of the Crimson zone, and her wide-open slapshot sizzled over goalie Christina Kessler’s shoulder.
Rebecca Martindale was credited with the assist on the score, which brought McGill within two.
But with just a second remaining in the second period, junior Katharine Chute put the final nail in the coffin.
Martlet Victoria Wells was in the box for tripping, giving Harvard a power play for the balance of the frame. The Crimson, as it did all afternoon with a man up, kept the pressure on in the McGill zone but couldn’t break through Salisbury’s wall.
As the clock wound down, freshman defender Hilary Hayssen put the puck on Farni’s stick. Stepping into the role of playmaker once again, Farni found Chute right in front of the net.
With 1.2 seconds on the clock in the third frame, Chute chipped the puck over Salisbury’s left shoulder, giving Harvard a 4-1 lead that proved insurmountable.
Though the Martlets got more shots off in the final frame—10—than in any other, Kessler held strong. She finished the game with 22 saves, while Salisbury recorded 29.
The Crimson was 1-for-5 on the power play and a perfect 5-for-5 on the penalty kill.
“We’re playing a little bit more of a pro style on the penalty kill,” Stone said. “And with a small squad, I think it saves us a little bit.”
As Harvard prepares to open its regular-season slate on Friday at Colgate, perhaps the most encouraging part of the game was the performance of its freshmen. Dempsey and Hayssen tallied assists, while forwards Margaret Chute and Kaitlin Spurling and defensemen Josephine Pucci and Kelsey Romatoski also saw significant playing time.
“This is like the land of opportunity for these freshmen, because they’re all getting an opportunity to play right off the bat,” Stone said. “And with that comes a lot of responsibility, and I think they felt it pretty heavy last weekend. Hopefully they can just go out there and play light and let their instincts take over.”

Oh, Canada. Facing off against McGill in a preseason exhibition game, the Harvard men’s hockey team battled to a 3-3 tie with the Canadian squad at Bright Hockey Center on Friday. Although the Crimson outshot McGill, 49-18, and had 13 powerplay chances—including a few minutes of 5-on-3 play—Harvard was unable to get the winning goal past McGill goaltender Hubert Morin.
“McGill’s a smart team, and when the goalie’s playing that well, it can make it awfully difficult to feel good about generating shots,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We had plenty of opportunities, and obviously our power play needs to be more effective, but there are certainly a few positives that came out of the game.”
“We outshot the team, but we couldn’t really score,” freshman Louis LeBlanc added. “Overall, it was a really good game, though.”
McGill jumped out to an early lead in the first period, with forwards Giullaume Doucet and Francis Varreault-Paul slipping a shot each past Crimson junior netminder Kyle Richter, who returned to Harvard ice for the first time since the 2007-2008 season.
But the Crimson had a few solid scoring chances, with 15 shots in the first period and 14 in the second. Halfway through the opening frame, senior defenseman Doug Rogers rocketed a shot at McGill’s net and took a swipe at the rebound, but Morin was too quick and saved both attempts.
And in the last minute of the first period, LeBlanc maneuvered through the McGill blueliners to launch a shot, which bounced off Morin’s pad. Although the rookie pounced on the rebound and prepared to rip a follow-up, a pair of defenseman double-teamed him and stole the puck.
“Even though we had the puck in their zone a lot, they made it very difficult,” Donato said. “[McGill] looks like they’re a little bit further advanced right now in their season than us, but I was happy with the way our guys persevered, and I thought we really had a great sense of urgency in the second half of the game.”
The Biega brothers initiated the Crimson comeback. With 20 seconds left in the first frame, junior Michael Biega took up a pass from LeBlanc and ripped a shot over Morin’s shoulder to put Harvard on the board, 1-2. Doucet scored his second goal of the night in the middle period, restoring the Canadians’ lead to two points.
But at 10:49 in the third period, captain Alex Biega fired a slapshot off freshman Conor Morrison’s pass to narrow the gap to 3-2.
Rogers—who had a total of six shots over the night and led both teams with 15 faceoff wins—launched an unassisted slapshot from the right, evening the score at three with just over two minutes left in regulation play.
“The bench was hungry to put pucks on the net and get that game tied up,” Donato said. “Their goalie was awfully good for the entire game and especially in the third, but I was really pleased with the way our guys kept coming.”
Although the Crimson failed to seal the deal in overtime, Richter came in with a clutch save against McGill’s Patrick Belzile, who ripped a shot with 25.9 seconds left on the clock, keeping the game at a tie.
Harvard was unable to pull out a victory against the Canadian squad, but the Crimson made some waves on the offensive front, largely because of the highly-touted freshman class, which made its collegiate debut over the weekend. While none of the rookies scored, they took a combined 19 shots on goal.
LeBlanc led the squad in shots on goal with eight attempts, and he earned an assist on Michael Biega’s first-period goal.
“Louie was tenacious on the puck all night,” Donato said.
“He shows up ready to play from the drop of the puck. They’re young, our freshman, but they did a lot of good things.”
Freshmen Marshall Everson and Danny Biega fired off four and three shots, respectively, and rookie Conor Morrison also earned an assist.
“They add a lot of talent and skill to the game,” Alex Biega added. “These are going to be impact players, and they really stepped up and filled roles right away.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After coming up short against Ivy League-leading Penn (16-4, 7-0) 3-1, the Harvard volleyball team (8-11, 4-4 Ivy League) sought to go over .500 in conference play when it took a two-game road trip against Brown (5-13, 1-6) and Yale (18-4, 6-1) this weekend.
The Crimson swept Brown 25-23, 25-17, 25-21 to go over .500 in conference play, and then came out firing against Yale (18-4, 6-1). But after a challenging first set, the Bulldogs overwhelmed the Crimson with its attack and escaped in three sets, 25-23, 25-18, 25-21, dropping Harvard back to an even record in conference play.
YALE 3, HARVARD 0
Five Crimson players notched at least five kills, but sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll led them all with nine. Senior Lily Durwood had 30 assists, extending her streak to six consecutive games with at least 30 assists.
After Yale opened a 14-9 lead in the first set, Harvard responded with four-straight points with the help of two kills from senior Chelsea Ono Horn to keep the first set a nail-biter to the end. The Crimson tied the score at 20, 22, and 23 in the first set, but two consecutive Harvard errors solidified the 25-23 opener for the Bulldogs.
“We came out ready to play against Yale and played three very solid games,” Ono Horn said. “It didn’t work out in our favor, but we definitely showed we were ready to play and we really did most things right”
The final two sets were a story of Yale runs, as Yale turned a 4-4 tie into a 10-5 lead and responded to the Crimson’s rally that tied the score at 11 with five consecutive points to lead 16-11. Ingersoll’s kill late in the set brought Harvard to a 20-18 deficit, but Yale responded with four kills and an ace to close out the set.
The third set saw five lead changes before the score was evened at 13-13 midway through the set.  The Bulldogs led early, and Harvard fought back to cut Yale’s lead to 20-18. But it was the same story as the second set, as Yale went on another four-point run to hold a 24-18 lead and eventually closed out the match with a 25-21 victory in the final set.
“There were definitely a couple of games where we let Yale get on a run or two,” Ono Horn said. “You definitely can’t let that happen, because they are the kind of team that can take that kind of advantage and run with it.”
Harvard will have one more shot at Yale when the teams square off at the Malkin Athletic Center on Nov. 6.
“We had trouble getting used to them as a team,” Durwood said. “They kept attacking our middle back, and that was hard for us to defend with our system...I definitely think we will adjust our defensive systems before we play them next time.”
HARVARD 3, BROWN 0
Harvard was seeking to go over .500 in conference play and ensure it wouldn’t hand Brown its first Ivy win of the year when the two conference foes squared in Providence Friday evening.
The Crimson escaped a tight first set and wore down Brown toward the end to gain the win.  With the score tied 4-4 in the first set, Brown made an outstanding run to quickly extend its lead to 12-5. Harvard rallied and eventually evened the ledger at 19 before a timely Bears error gave the Crimson the lead for good, 22-21.  Harvard never trailed in the following two sets to secure a crucial league victory.
Junior Mikaelle Comrie led Harvard with 16 kills and only two errors on 24 swings to notch a .412 hitting percentage.  Sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer added eight kills on 20 swings for a .400 mark for the day.
“We came out really ready to play against Brown, and we worked a good system,” Ono Horn said. “We started off excited to play, worked within ourselves, and took care of business.”
Sophomore Christine Wu had 17 digs for the Crimson and Durwood recorded 30 assists.
“Brown is kind of a tough opponent—you never really know what to expect from them,” Durwood said.  “They play really scrappy defense, and they can really come back at you. This hasn’t been a great year for them, but they are still a really tricky team to play, and it was good that we got the win.”
Harvard held a 42-36 kill advantage as well as 6-1 lead in blocks for the match.  The Bears out-dug the Crimson slightly, 60-53.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
During the 2009 spring season, one of the most compelling stories about Harvard men’s lightweight crew was the dominance of its freshman boat. The Crimson rookies blew by the competition week in and week out.
With the tale of their predecessors’ success in mind, this year’s freshmen seem poised to write a sequel. Yesterday, the lightweight boats took to the water at the Carnegie Chase in Princeton, N.J., and the rookies crossed the finish line in the freshman eight race with a resounding victory.
Harvard finished in 13:58.086, beating second-place Navy by over 16 seconds.
“This is the second year in a row that we won the freshman eight,” lightweight captain Martin Eiermann said. “We knew from practice that they have a very fast boat. It’s a pretty motivated bunch.”
Because last year’s freshmen also won their event at the Carnegie Chase, this year’s boat was granted a favorable start ahead of Princeton. The rookies rowed well throughout the race but really began to put distance between them and their opponents in the third sector.
“We felt really good,” freshman rower Eric Schultzer said. “The class last year was really strong. I think there’s definitely a lot of pressure on us based on the quality of work they did.”
Novice coxswain Alex Sall was especially impressive, directing the freshman eight to victory in his first race with the boat.
“He did a great job,” Schultzer said.
While the freshmen cruised to victory, Harvard’s varsity rowers saw varying degrees of success, with the top boats excelling but finding first place elusive.
In the varsity eight race, the Crimson 1V finished in 13:23.708 but failed to catch up with a speedy Princeton boat that came in at 13:19.685 and had to settle for second.
“We knew that Princeton was going to be very fast after Head of the Charles,” Eiermann said. “We knew that [how Harvard stacked up against the Tigers] would be the benchmark to really measure how we would do.”
The Crimson struggled with the wind early on, but found a rhythm and rowed to a promising, if not ideal, finish.
“Being four seconds behind Princeton is not where we’d like to end up in the spring but for now it was a solid race,” Eiermann said.
The Harvard second varsity eight was not as pleased with its performance. The 2V came in at 14:07.466 to take a 17th-place finish, crossing the line just ahead of the Crimson 3V.
“The 2V wasn’t quite satisfied with their performance,” Eiermann said. “They hoped to do a little better, and I know they have more speed than they showed here.”
Eiermann acknowledged that the boat lineups had been shuffled, as the Harvard coaches are experimenting with different mixes before finalizing their boats for the spring season. He was encouraged by the Crimson’s performance across the board, especially since the 2V and 3V boats rowed well compared to their counterparts from other schools.
“This is definitely kind of a basis from which to work,” Eiermann said. “It shows that the team is very deep.”
After the varsity eight race in the morning, Harvard split up its top two boats and placed them in the varsity four event. The Crimson’s A and B boats flourished, taking second and fifth, respectively, while the C and D came in 14th and 16th.
The A boat barely missed out on a win, finishing just over four tenths of a second behind Princeton—who once again was Harvard’s spoiler—at 14:48.045. The B boat crossed the line at 15:08.470.
The Crimson now looks forward to the Tail of the Charles Regatta on Nov. 21, its final competition before the grueling winter training session begins.
“The spirits are pretty high,” Eiermann said. “We can leave this weekend with our heads held high.”

CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Oct. 26 sports article "Rookies Dominate Field at Princeton’s Carnegie Chase" incorrectly stated that the Harvard men's lightweight crew's freshman boat came up short against Princeton last April 25. In fact, Yale's was the only team to place ahead of the boat in the 2009 spring season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black and White Varsity Eight is usually accustomed to racing in dual competition, but yesterday’s Princeton Chase, a head race hosted by Princeton University, gave the rowers of the Radcliffe 1V a chance to test themselves over a three-mile stretch of Lake Carnegie in Princeton, N.J.
The event, which draws crews from across the collegiate rowing circuit and features both men’s and women’s races, comes just one week after the Head of the Charles Regatta and offered the Black and White’s lightweight squad a second opportunity to compete in an event focused solely on intercollegiate rowers.
“The conditions were perfect. It was warm and sunny, great especially compared to last weekend when we had snow,” freshman Liz Hamilton said.
Yale carried the day in the women’s varsity eight race, coming in first place with a finishing time of 14:46.323, while the Black and White clocked in at 16:06.052.
The Black and White’s split time came in at 9:09.899.
This finish put Radcliffe just seconds behind the Georgetown C Lightweight Boat, which crossed the line with a time of 16:03.419.
“There were a lot of strong boats in the field,” Hamilton said. “It’s a competitive event, but I think we stacked up against them pretty well.”
Radcliffe, racing in the women’s varsity heat along with many other heavyweight boats, finished in 21st place out of a total of 55 boats in the team’s only race of the day.
“It is a different race mentality. It’s longer. You’re not directly lining up against other boats, and you’re racing the clock,” Hamilton said.
“When you finish the race, you don’t necessarily know who has won, and you have to focus on having a great race for yourself.”
Unlike the way many other crews approached this competition, the Black and White did not send a second varsity eight or any novice boats. Given the sheer number of boats involved, a strategic shift is also needed to find success in this type of event.
“Our plan was to attack the race right off the start. We were hoping to hold them off from the start, which we did very well,” Hamilton said.
The fall season finishes up with two more competitions, a novice race at Dartmouth on Nov. 7 and the Foot of the Charles on the following weekend.
“I think we’re getting a lot stronger, and we think it will only get better from here to it,” Hamilton said.

Heads up, aspiring t-shirt designers—if you've ever thought the official Harvard/Yale shirts have trended a little stale or more than a little staid, here's a chance to spice things up. Harvard sex magazine HBOMB will hold its first official Harvard/Yale t-shirt contest this year, calling for "sexy, classy, smutty and—most of all—witty t-shirt designs" that "reflect HBOMB's vision."
As an addendum, the graphic should, in fact, also reference Harvard and/or Yale, the instructions note.
Not much word on the contest's criteria, but if the honor of having your design emblazoned on shirts that some students will cherish for years isn't enough, the other incentives should make it worth your while. The creator of the best design will receive not only a free t-shirt, but also a "patented" gift basket "guaranteed to numb your body with pleasure, or at least have some cool goodies in it." Flyby isn't sure what these super extra awesome awards might be (besides that it probably won't be a basket of fruit and cheese), but we hear that mystery just ups the thrill factor.
Entries should be sent to Eva Gillis-Buck (ebuck@fas.harvard.edu) by 3pm on Nov. 1. When the hundred variations of Harvard/Yale shirts start popping up all over campus, Flyby will be keeping an eye out for "the sexy ones."

Jerry Seinfeld once said, “A bookstore is one of the only pieces of evidence we have that people are still thinking.” In an age of 140-character updates it appears, shockingly, that many Bostonians are still thinking in long form.
This past Saturday, the first ever Boston Book Festival was held in Copley Square, featuring authors and performers across all genres and art forms.
One of the most interesting and well-attended events was a interview with John Hodgman. You may not know the name, but you probably know his face. (Hint: he's a PC.)
He was interviewed by author Tom Perrotta ("Election," "The Abstinence Teacher"), who taught him once when Hodgman was at Yale. Despite his low-caliber education, Hodgman has enjoyed much success as a writer, literary agent and personification of a computer since his graduation in 1994.
Speaking to an adoring audience that was almost entirely college-aged in the sanctuary of Old South Church, Hodgman quipped, “I’ve always wanted my own megachurch.” More from the PC and the Yard cow-grazer post-jump.
When asked about how he took on his persona of a (fake) expert in every subject, Hodgman referred to his experience as a literary agent in New York City.
Hodgman also commented that he used to think that “it was not okay to be funny...I never considered myself to be a humorist or a comic writer… until the Daily Show,” he said.
Hollis Research Professor of Divinity Harvey G. Cox, best known for recently grazing his cow in Harvard Yard, and author of "When Jesus Came to Harvard," was also at the Book Festival. In a panel called “Matters of Faith”, he spoke about religion in society today.
He expressed that all the distractions in the world today “are inducing in us a cultural attention deficit syndrome.”
“I think faith is a basic, irrefutable human need,” he said, drawing from his years of working with Harvard students. “There is a hunger… for something beyond our capacity to be manipulated.”
From documentary fanatics (Ken Burns made an appearance) to adults who read kid lit (Chris Van Allsburg, author of "The Polar Express" was there, and so was Clifford the Big Red Dog) to spoken word poets, the inaugural BBF had something for everyone. Flyby is eager for the second edition.

Poisoned coffee sent six Harvard Medical School researchers to the hospital last August with symptoms ranging from ear ringing to fainting. HMS waited until last Friday to let people know that the incident occurred, and in the memo that they released, they told us the name of the semi-deadly chemical that caused the calamity: sodium azide.
There's more info about the incident in today's copy of The Crimson, but if you want to know more about NaN3 and about the mystery, check out what we've discovered below.
The funny thing about sodium azide is that it usually saves lives. That's because, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sodium azide is best known for its role in air bags. When a car crashes, an electric charge causes the sodium azide to explode and, in turn, release nitrogen to inflate the air bag.
In this case, though, sodium azide almost did the opposite. When consumed, inhaled, or touched, it's said to have symptoms similar to cyanide: rapid breathing, dizziness, and an increased heart rate.
These symptoms prompted the six to rush to Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center (one in an ambulance, according to Mabel P. Duyao, research director in the HMS Pathology Department) on August 26. The Harvard University Police Department is in the process of figuring out how the sodium azide got into the coffee machine, but as of now, what happened is still a mystery.

Quidditch may not be the same without flying broomsticks, but there's still no lack of competition for the newly formed Harvard Quidditch team.
For the first time ever, the Quidditch team undertook a grueling 4 hour journey to compete in the Intercollegiate Quidditch World Cup at Middlebury College, in a quest for glory, thrills, and a chance to emerge victorious in yet another contest against that college in New Haven. Twelve valiant competitors, an assorted crew including a member of the varsity track team and all diehard Harry Potter fans, boarded a bus in the predawn hours yesterday morning to face off against some of the most experienced college Quidditch teams across the country, running across grassy fields with brooms between their legs.
But when the Harvard team arrived, beating Yale was a simple matter of showing up—which the Yale team didn't manage to do, thereby forfeiting the match.
"Yale is clearly scared of us," said Quidditch co-captain Stacy L. Rush, a visiting student from Toronto.
Read more about the blood, guts, and glory of the Intercollegiate Quidditch World Cup after the jump.
Harvard's other matches against BU, Emerson, and UMass Amherst proceeded less smoothly. In the words of Rush, "we were pulverized in the first one, beaten in the second one, and almost won the third one." Rush said that Harvard had been leading 30-10, but the appearance and capture of the Snitch was a game-changer, resulting in a 30-40 scoreboard (doesn't that sound suspiciously like Harry Potter's uncanny ability to save his team heroically, in just about every match?).
The injury rate among hard-tackling Quidditch players adds another touch of realism. Several players on other teams broke bones, including a collarbone, said co-captain Alana J. Biden '11.
"You're allowed to do anything but pull hair," Biden said. But for the casualties, too bad there's no such thing as magical healing (a flick of a wand, a swig of potion, and Harry's always good to go).
As a relatively new team organized only two weeks ago, Harvard has a long way to go compared to eventual World Cup winners Middlebury—who founded the Intercollegiate Quidditch Association and who has won the World Cup every year since the first tournament in 2005. But according to Rush, the Harvard team has significant potential for improvement, given the natural athleticism of its members.
"We just have to get our game together and work out strategies," she said.

Those are pretty good odds. It is more likely than getting rejected from Harvard.
