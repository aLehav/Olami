After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAMBRIDGE, England—This pub is called Revolution and although it’s a Thursday night and there’s a five pound cover, the July 4th crowd is teeming with both Americans and Brits. I’m sitting on the roof deck and talking to two youngish guys from the town of Cambridge, UK. It’s a genuine cross-cultural experience: we discuss everything from the American club scene to British words for inebriation (“Wankered”? “Trolleyed”? Really?). Finally, one of the two asks me an important question: “Well, you’re an American. What do you think about gay marriage?”
Before I have time to respond, he quickly answers his own question, declaring, “I think people should have rights and all, just don’t stick something up my fucking ass!”
The guy and his friend both laugh. I smile along uneasily. The conversation quickly moves on to something else.
I feel somewhat like I have missed an important political moment. Wasn’t there somewhere in that interaction where I was supposed to say, “Well, In My Own Experience as a queer woman, I might marry a woman and I of course want that to be okay but there’s a lot more to rights than just marriage and also gay men are not all rapists—”?
But I didn’t say any of those things. I didn’t say anything at all.
Later that night, I reassure myself with excuses. There was no room for such an interjection in the tempo of our pub conversation. Plus, I had already told the two men about my boyfriend so that might be complicated to explain. Plus, I didn’t really technically disagree with anything they said—I don’t think people should be sticking things up each other’s asses non-consensually, either! Plus, when in Rome…
None of my justifications could help me shake the feeling that I had somehow failed in my American queer ambassadorial mission.
Of course, I didn’t have to travel to England to find people not familiar with liberal discourse on gay rights. And I’m not sure if there is, or should be, such thing as an American queer ambassadorial mission. (If there is, it’s exemplified by the Obama administration’s decision that US foreign aid be tied to countries’ gay rights records. And I don’t want anything to do with that—either the US aid or the strangely prescriptive liberal universalism.)
So on one level, I don’t think I should feel guilty for not pushing back when I could have. On the other hand, perhaps my status as a foreign student with a really cool American accent lends me enough authority that I could have made a difference in the minds of my two new British friends.
I’m still not sure whether I did the right thing or the wrong thing or if there even is a right answer on how to confront heterosexism when you find it on the roof deck of a British bar. Either way, it’s strange (but perhaps not unsurprising) that it took spending my fourth of July in England to make me think hard about what it means to be a queer American.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Covers give a strangely pleasant sense of displacement, like being in two places at once. I accept the idea of music being a “universal language,” and so I don’t understand the fury of a diehard fan raging at the inaccuracy of a song adapted and translated to fit different places and time periods. If sentiments expressed in music are infinitely diverse, then covers are rare bridges between disparate experiences and emotions of people all over the world.
Listen to the English folk band Daughter’s cover of French electronica duo Daft Punk’s recent single “Get Lucky.” More than a channel is crossed when a groovy nightlife refrain becomes a tired hymn. The new version brings out the meaninglessness and ennui when days and nights blend together, and reminds us that feeling one has “come too far to give up” can be a listless sensation.
Things move in the opposite direction in Purity Ring’s cover of Soulja Boy’s “Grammy,” where Megan James’ childish, Canadian voice turns Mississippi rapper DeAndre Way’s unworried flow, a mature assertion of skill, into an aggressive and over-excited call to arms by a young upstart, full of reverberating synth.
The immense self-assurance it takes for a musician to make another’s song her own comes across in the quality of her music. “Hanging on the Telephone” and “The Tide is High” were unremarkable before Blondie, and their brazen new-wave conviction made them irrevocably belong to Debbie Harry. The disco years, full of imitation and experimentation, were an era that overflowed with more confident and universally engaging songs than ever before.
It’s hard to think of a song more unfamiliar to their works, but nothing better expresses the contradictions at the heart of The XX’s music than their cover of Aaliyah’s “Hot Like Fire.” Behind rolling waves of bass, the English pop band manages to transform the Brooklyn R&B singer’s lyrics “I won’t keep you” from the words of someone excitedly giving in to the desires of a significant other into weary sentiments heard in a relationship moving just past its peak. It’s strange that some of the least faithful covers are best at overcoming seemingly unsurpassable musical divides.
But, though there are few things more beautiful than one thoroughly unique artist thoughtfully imitating another, a cover is much more than just that. They tie together entirely different experiences and memories in a remarkable way. We all lead our lives somewhere between folk, rock, pop, disco and hip-hop, and covers help us figure out where exactly we are.
If someone asked me what my favorite music was before the age of 13, the answer was always Paul Simon. These being days before I had an iPod, I was oblivious to the predictable order of track listings, and pleasantly surprised whenever cozy tunes like “Kodachrome” or “Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes” came on the family stereo. But with the adrenaline pace of junior year in high school, I found the percussion-fueled clarity of the Austin, Texas band Spoon to be more soothing, since their opaque lyrics and reliably strong percussion could fit any part of my life.
It was only a couple of years back when I heard Britt Daniel cover Paul Simon’s “Peace Like A River.” Two very different parts of my life found a link there, in the same way two very different kinds of music did. Paul Simon’s music will always have a place in the living room of the house I grew up in, playing Scrabble with my family. But Britt Daniel’s voice evokes late nights during the summer, driving myself back home from hanging out with friends or seeing a movie.
Covers are remarkably fun to listen to because they transport us, much in the same way that music you hear during a great scene in a movie sounds better than it actually is. With two songs, you get two sets of experiences, and a sense of understanding about how each experience is part of an indistinguishable whole: nightlife is both exciting and draining, being an artist is a confidence game, and relationships are emotional roller-coasters. Covers are worldly in more than one sense of the word. When artistic inspiration crosses the globe, it allows half-formed ideas lying dormant in lyric and noise to become more sophisticated.
Music is one of the most intensely personal art forms, kaleidoscopic to the point of seemingly unbridgeable difference between alternative indie rockers and folksy singer-songwriters. But knowing that a passage exists between Britt Daniel’s shrewd, acute southern-city drawl and Paul Simon’s wise northeastern levity makes the whole world smaller in a very reassuring way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly 22 years ago, Mustapha Jorti helped welcome the first guests to the Inn at Harvard. On Monday, the University-owned hotel’s final day of operation, he manned a quiet front desk as the Inn’s last patrons checked out of their rooms.
“This is a sad day,” Jorti said as a worker with an outside consulting company dismantled the front desk servers. “We spend more time together than [I spend] with my wife back home... You see people leaving—It’s not an easy thing.”
The Inn, a stately brick building at 1201 Mass. Ave., has long been living on borrowed time. Operated under a contract that allows Harvard to adapt it for institutional use with 12-months’ notice, the hotel kept its doors open through the tenures of four University presidents until Harvard announced last summer that its time had finally come.
The University is shutting down the hotel to convert the building into swing space housing for students displaced by construction related to House Renewal, the University’s more than $1 billion project to eventually renovate all 12 upperclassmen Houses. Over the next year, Harvard plans to transform the Inn’s guest rooms, stately atrium, and conference rooms into dorm-style bedrooms, a dining hall, and social spaces. The building is expected to be ready in time for the 2014-2015 academic year, when it will be used along with three University-owned apartment buildings to house displaced Dunster residents while their House is under construction.
With the Inn’s closure, between 50 and 60 of its 65 employees will lose their jobs, while the others will move over to the Harvard Square Hotel, according to Collegiate Hospitality CEO Richard Carbone. Collegiate Hospitality operated the Inn at Harvard and continues to manage its sister University-owned hotel, Harvard Square Hotel.
Of the employees who are being laid off, approximately 20 have already found employment with other hotels in the area, while others are retiring or currently in the process of interviewing for new jobs, Carbone said. He said Collegiate Hospitality will issue severance packages to the laid-off employees, and though he declined to comment on their value or duration, several recipients said they thought the packages were fair.
“Everyone at Harvard’s been very supportive, very helpful in reemploying everybody, and been very sensitive to the process of closing the Inn,” Carbone said, citing, among other resources, Harvard-hosted resume-writing and interview-training workshops held for the Inn’s employees over the past several months.
Campus Services is also in the midst of interviewing “a number” of the Inn’s culinary workers for open positions with Harvard University Dining Services, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement.
But for some, the University’s efforts cannot atone for its decision to close the hotel. Mohamed Medjahed, an assistant front desk manager who has worked at the Inn for 17 years, said he believes Harvard decision-makers gave too little thought to the livelihoods of the Inn’s longtime workers.
“You hurt us,” said Medjahed, whose wife has also worked for the Inn for 16 years. “You hurt our kids and family.... It’s not about money; it’s about the place, we love the place—we work as family here.”
And not all Inn at Harvard employees face a certain future. Though both Jorti and Medjahed said they were optimistic about their future employment prospects, they have yet to find new work. Both said they plan to go abroad to visit family before searching for new jobs.
But on this final day, they said, their thoughts were focused on the Inn. They said that they and other employees had marked their last days at the hotel by taking photos, exchanging goodbyes and email addresses, and serving their final guests. Though no one would be returning for another night, patrons were served breakfast as usual Monday morning, and housekeeping staff were instructed to tidy the rooms and make beds as they normally would.
As he worked his final shift at the operating hotel Monday, Medjahed recalled some of his fondest memories of his time at the Inn—among them, meeting Jackie Chan, Queen Latifah, Shakira, and Lionel Richie during their visits to Cambridge.
Jorti, who along with Carbone and two others was there for both the Inn’s first and final days, said wistfully: “It’s been a wonderful 22 years.”
