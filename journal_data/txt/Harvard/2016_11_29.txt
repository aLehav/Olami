After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. "Lemonade," Beyoncé
Beyoncé dropped her explosive sixth album and second visual album, “Lemonade,” this year. The work was accompanied by an hour-long HBO film featuring poetry from Warsan Shire. A concept album, “Lemonade” tells a story of infidelity, revenge, and forgiveness, laced with powerful moments of feminism—black feminism in particular. Though typically categorized as an R&B album, the music at times roams the genres of jazz, funk, country, and pop: Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake, and Kendrick Lamar are featured on several tracks. The album’s extensive lyrical references to marital drama also caused a storm of infidelity rumors for Beyoncé’s husband, Jay Z. —Rebecca H. Dolan

2. "The Life of Pablo," Kanye West
Controversy aside (“Famous,” anyone?), Kanye West’s seventh album might strike some as unpolished, even incoherent. But consider the record’s masterful arrangement fused with West’s fiery cadence and biting, unabashedly self-aware humor, and “The Life of Pablo” proves to be a work of inventive execution and staggering emotion. Here, West radiates when most vulnerable: “FML,” for instance, is a raw confession—one punctuated with thoughtful pauses and moody sampling from British post-punk unit Section 25’s “Hit”—about his relationship revealing some “layers to [his] soul.” “Pablo” is ultimately pure Yeezy, often offensive but also ingenious and provocative. —Ha D.H. Le

3. "Blonde," Frank Ocean
If you weren't convinced after hearing “Channel Orange” that we owe Frank Ocean the world, then you had better be after listening to “Blonde,” the feverishly anticipated follow-up to Ocean’s critically lauded, genre-bending studio debut. More James Blake than James Brown, laden with a vulnerability intimate in its delivery but grandiose in its vision, “Blonde”—an exercise in defiance of both social and musical convention—sweeps away all preconceived notions of what it means to be an R&B artist and presents Ocean at his open-hearted best.—Victoria Lin
4. "Anti," Rihanna
Pop queen Rihanna released “Anti,” her eighth album, early this year. The Barbadian singer-executive produced her own work in collaboration with DJ Mustard, Timbaland, Jeff Bhasker, and other acclaimed artists. Breaking away from her established pop style, “Anti” includes strong dancehall and soul influences. Drake is featured on lead single “Work,” which makes use of Jamaican patois, and Rihanna gives nods to ’80s rock on “Kiss It Better” and ’60s soul on “Higher.” Much of the album’s material may deal with Rihanna’s own failed romances, perhaps lyrically alluding to Travis Scott in “Woo” and Chris Brown in “Love on the Brain.”—Rebecca H. Dolan

5. "Views," Drake
Drake reeled from from a devil-may-care 2015—the dark, swaggering “If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late”; the spontaneous collaboration on “What a Time to Be Alive”; the Meek Mill beef—into a fourth studio album, “Views,” in turns tender, laconic, joyful, and paranoid. With its raw adrenaline polished away and a colder, more jaded CN Tower’s view, the impression was of a newly hardened Drake persona; despite the chill, though, the album’s tracks dominated charts all summer ’16 and beyond. “Y’all showed me that nothing’s guaranteed,” Drake raps broodingly on “Pop Style,” but the persistence of “Views” in our memory certainly seems to be. —Emily Zhao 

6. "untitled unmastered," Kendrick Lamar
Each song is titled “untitled,” adorned with its track number (lest the listener cannot count), and a cryptographic date (perhaps a recording date, the date of a moment of racial tension in the United States, or a string of eight random numbers). “untitled unmastered” is the least complete (cohesive and comprehensible are equally apt adjectives) album in Kendrick Lamar’s oeuvre. Yes, random and untamed—Lamar still produces a paean to the psychological effects of inhabiting a world that is neither pre-racial nor post-racial over West Coast synths and samples of Motown funk. Precisely through its ungainly demeanor, “untitled” allows for a disarranged journey into one of rap’s most masterful, unmastered minds. —Aziz B. Yakub

7. "A Seat at the Table," Solange Knowles
Solange Knowles’s third solo album, “A Seat at the Table,” offers polished, gorgeous ruminations on her experience as a black woman, drawn deep from her family’s roots and the rich tradition of black music. The album melds R&B, soul, and funk to create a richly textured whole that maintains a strong sense of unity, despite its variegated musical heritage. Highlights include the album’s opener, “Rise,” a crooning, delicately jazzy testament to the act of enduring, as well as single “Cranes in the Sky,” which balances a relaxed airiness with lyrics that evince a deep desire for escape. —Adriano O. Iqbal

8. "22, A Million," Bon Iver
Bon Iver’s melodically experimental, unapologetically arrhythmic “22, A Million” marks a sharp musical departure from both the lush chamber pop of his 2011 Grammy-winning effort, “Bon Iver,” and the raw folky yearning of its 2007 predecessor, “For Emma, Forever Ago.” Between the warbling autotune of “715 (Creeks)” and the jarring instrumental distortion of “10 (Death Breast),” it all seems like it might be enough to deter a casual listener—but Justin Vernon’s trademark layered falsetto stitches the record together with the thinnest of threads to form an evocative, remarkably accessible whole. —Victoria Lin

9. "Blackstar," David Bowie
David Bowie released his 25th studio album two days before his death, proving that even when he dies, he dies cooler than the rest of us. “Blackstar” is a fusion of wild jazz and surrealist theater, a pretty heavy work that might not be easily likable for the casual listener. Like most great Bowie albums, it is full of subtexts, complex melodies, and otherworldly images. The title track exhibits Bowie’s eclectic musical genius as he blends his signature narrative songwriting with the beautiful saxophone solo from Donny McCaslin. It also sets up an enigmatic, melancholic atmosphere that continues through to other great tracks such as “‘Tis a Pity She’s a Whore” and “I Can’t Give Everything Away.” —Tianxing V. Lan

9. "A Moon Shaped Pool," Radiohead
Thom Yorke and company may be approaching 50, but they clearly do not intend to rest on their laurels. From the contemplative and personal “True Love Waits” to the familiarly neurotic “Identikit,” Radiohead’s ninth album, “A Moon Shaped Pool,” finds them at their most eclectic and perfect. The lead single and opener, “Burn the Witch,” featuring Yorke’s trademark spooky falsetto over a thundering string section, became an immediate Radiohead classic upon release. Its lyrics, a terrifying imitation of right-wing frenzy, seem incredibly timely—even if their first draft, like those of several tracks, were written more than a decade ago, perhaps a testament to the staying power of one of the millennium’s greatest acts. —Trevor J. Levin

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. The Big Short
Director Adam McKay doesn’t need champagne waterfalls to make Wall Street fascinating. Instead, he reels in Anthony Bourdain to explain collateralized debt obligations using halibut. Innovative techniques, along with riveting performances such as Christian Bale’s eccentric take on hedge fund manager Michael Burry, make “The Big Short” fresh, witty, and smart. It isn’t all humor, however: Rife with cold, sterile visuals and jarring cuts, the film exudes both jolting chaos and controlled style, potentially a cinematographic reflection of the current turbulent global financial situation. Cynical yet vivacious, “The Big Short” stands tall. —Ha D.H. Le

2. Star Wars: The Force Awakens
A decade after the last Star Wars movie, a beloved franchise roars back to life in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Return to a familiar galaxy far, far, away and long, long, ago, and follow a host of new characters as they set off to protect the universe from evil with blasters, lightsabers, and good old-fashioned Jedi mind tricks. If the plot looks a little familiar, pay it no mind—that’s just director J.J. Abrams delivering a time-honored formula with a modern finish. —J. Thomas Westbrook

3. Zootopia
For a Disney movie, “Zootopia” is surprisingly brave. It grapples with race relations in an elegant metaphor, simplifying themes with anthropomorphic animals in a predator-prey-centric world. The movie follows Judy Hopps—the world’s first-ever rabbit cop—on her first investigative mission. She unwillingly partners with fox con artist Nick Wilde to discover the cracks in the city’s seemingly harmonious predator-prey relationship. With quirky, self-aware humor and bright, bubbly visuals, “Zootopia” crafts an imperfect world filled with imperfect characters who earn “Zootopia” its place on this “Top 10” list. —Grace Z. Li

4. Deadpool
Whatever the plot of superhero flick “Deadpool” might be, it’s far from the film’s main attraction. Audiences flocked to theaters to see Deadpool (played by Ryan Reynolds) himself. The gleeful antihero broke the fourth wall left and right, poking fun at Hollywood, at the oversaturated superhero genre, and at his own ridiculous storyline. Despite being a bone-shattering, blood-splattering celebration of gore, “Deadpool” sounds more like a stand-up comic at the top of his game, and like all good comedians, he keeps his audience laughing along to the last breath. —J. Thomas Westbrook

5. Finding Dory
Ellen DeGeneres reprises her role as the lovable, forgetful blue tang Dory in this highly anticipated sequel. “Finding Dory” inspires whimsy with its colorful visuals, clever humor, and witty references to its predecessor. But it also strikes deep, flooding the film with the homesickness and frustrating confusion that plague Dory during her search for her long-lost parents. In “Finding Dory,” the protagonist is fully fleshed out, making this a movie that can stand on its own without riding on the fame of “Finding Nemo.” Despite its predictable plotline, “Finding Dory” still stands out as inventive and pure with its punchy quips and poignant recollections. —Grace Z. Li

6. Moonlight
“Moonlight,” the critically acclaimed second feature film from director Barry Jenkins, follows its protagonist Chiron (played in three successive episodes by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders, and Trevante Rhodes) as he grows up in the Liberty City neighborhood of Miami. The film explores the challenges of being black, poor, and gay in America but also weaves together a nuanced, empathetic portrayal of Chiron as an individual and of the bonds that link him to family and friends. Visually stunning, perfectly scored, deeply thoughtful, and completely heartbreaking, “Moonlight” is without doubt one of the best—and most important—films of the year. —Elizabeth C. Keto

7. The Lobster
The English-language debut of Greek writer and director Yorgos Lanthimos, “The Lobster” depicts a dystopian world where being single is a crime, and those who can’t find romantic partners within a six-week window are turned into an animal of their choice. Bizarre? Absolutely. But the deadpan social satire, anchored by strong performances from Rachel Weisz and an uncharacteristically slovenly Colin Farrell, succeeds in grounding its madcap premise with a unexpectedly romantic core. Part love story, part not-so-subtle affront to gendered power dynamics and the stigmas associated with singledom, “The Lobster” is occasionally moving, frequently disturbing, and always original.—Shaun V. Gohel

8. Captain America: Civil War
The third installment in Marvel’s Captain America trilogy follows warfare among the Avengers as Captain America (Chris Evans) refuses to allow the government to regulate superheroic interventions in international affairs, which pits him against Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.). It’s a superhero flick that nevertheless touches on some key political issues, such as the role of military contractors in overseas conflict. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo pull the sprawling plotlines and ensemble cast of a dozen main characters into a quick-paced, funny, and dramatic film. —Elizabeth C. Keto

9. Doctor Strange
Let’s face it: It was only a matter of time before Benedict Cumberbatch ended up starring in a superhero film. In “Doctor Strange,” eponymous protagonist and eminent neurosurgeon Dr. Strange loses the use of his hands in a devastating car accident. His dogged quest to heal himself ultimately imbues him with occult powers in a faux-Tibetan aesthetic, which he must employ to defeat sorcerer Kaecilius and his cabal of zealots. Despite the glut of uninspired superhero films in this past decade, “Doctor Strange” manages to evade mediocrity through its technically-savvy incorporation of mystic elements, a fairly nimble script, and strong performances from Cumberbatch et al.—Adriano O. Iqbal

10. Sausage Party
After a horrendous accident shatters their routine, vacuum-packaged lives, a sheltered hot dog wiener and his companions set out to find the truth about their grocery store and what really happens in the world outside. “Sausage Party” proves Seth Rogen’s continued dedication to pushing his hotboxed silly-guy niche. Though their only aim appears to be to poke raunchy fun at franchises that deliver high morals via googly-eyed animations, Rogen and Co. somehow craft a movie that ends in an extended, literal food orgy, yet also works as an incisive allegory about bigotry, willing ignorance, friendship, and courage. —Emily Zhao

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
1. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver
While other late-night comedy talk show hosts snatched the endless low-hanging fruit offered by the most absurd presidential election in modern history, John Oliver took advantage of the weekly format of “Last Week Tonight” to delve into enormously important issues that escaped the breathless 24-hour news cycle: special-purpose districts, police reform, and school segregation. He peppered his searing exposés with irreverent, absurd throwaway lines, creating possibly the funniest lectures of all time. Oliver may have concluded a segment titled “Fuck 2016” by blowing up the four digits, but this crazy year certainly gave him material—enabling “Last Week Tonight” to reach new heights of biting satire and razor-sharp insight. —Trevor J. Levin

2. Game of Thrones
The sixth season of “Game of Thrones” brings a whole new meaning to the phrase “kill your darlings.” Cersei’s violent streak combusts in shocking levels of bloodshed, Sansa turns darker with every episode, and Daenerys continues to defy the impossible. As expected, the series keeps adrenaline running high as more characters die, more secrets are revealed, and more fan theories are put to rest. “Game of Thrones” soars past its own reputation, leaving a reason to continue watching in every episode. —Grace Z. Li

3. House of Cards
Netflix has consistently produced intriguing content, and “House of Cards” is no exception. Having left Frank Underwood both at a presidential campaign high and in a marital crisis in season three, “House of Cards” had a lot to handle in its fourth season. Perhaps spurred to raise the bar after the previous season’s suboptimal reviews, the showrunners succeeded in elevating “House of Cards” back to the engrossing drama that made it a household name. Underwood’s hold on the presidency—which some would argue is as dangerous as Trump’s—represents a fictional reprieve from real-life politics, but the stakes are just as high. —Mila Gauvin II

4. Stranger Things
“Stranger Things,” a Netflix sci-fi extravaganza, is—well, strange. What starts as a typical lost child mystery turns into an elaborate saga featuring supernatural forces, government experimentation, telekinesis, and a rather creepy young girl. Creators Ross and Matt Duffer pull the whole thing off, though, and the final product proves to be simultaneously bold, bizarre, addictive, and touching. On a more meta level, “Stranger Things” functions as an excellent homage to Spielberg films and 1980s television, blending giddy nostalgia with careful historical reflection. —Charlotte L.R. Anrig

5. Veep
The fifth season of HBO’s biting political satire “Veep” follows former Vice President-turned-accidental President Selena Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as she lobbies for re-election with the help of—or perhaps in spite of—her jaded, bumbling team of egotists. Hilarious and unrelentingly cynical, “Veep” boasts one of the tightest, most joke-dense scripts in modern television. The cast's cutting barbs fly like bullets, tearing through egos and skewering insecurities at breakneck speed (a highlight: “Right now you’re about as toxic as a urinal cake in Chernobyl.”) Though Meyer's political aspirations are consistently hampered, "Veep," much like its insults, shows no sign of slowing down. —Shaun V. Gohel

6. Orange is the New Black
The fourth season of Jenji Kohan’s “Orange Is the New Black” delivers its usual bitter comedy and silly tragedy as its characters—imprisoned women—struggle to achieve and maintain power. This time around, though, all of the elaborate and multifaceted drama takes a particularly powerful turn: Nearly every character in the ensemble cast battles the prison’s painfully racist hierarchy, and for one woman in particular, the outcome turns out to be fatal. The show also addresses transgender rights, inadequate mental illness healthcare, and several other politically resonant issues in an unusual but ultimately moving display of ambition and social conscience.  —Charlotte L.R. Anrig

7. Bojack Horseman
By the Netflix original’s third season, it no longer feels strange that one of the bleakest shows on television is an animated dramedy set in a world where anthropomorphic animals live alongside humans. Perhaps encouraged by season two’s rave reviews, “BoJack Horseman” writers took bold risks in their third go-around, including a nearly dialogue-less underwater episode and another centered on a refreshingly honest portrayal of abortion. Along the way, viewers watch the titular movie-star horse sink deeper into existential despair and discover astonishing depths in the supporting characters (and, of course, laugh hysterically at visual puns and animal jokes). —Trevor J. Levin

7. Black Mirror
The conspicuously titled science fiction anthology “Black Mirror” returned for a tumultuous (and murderous) third season on Netflix. “Black Mirror” is somewhere between a modern day “Twilight Zone” and a technophobe’s fever dream. At its best the Charlie Brooker-helmed show portrays the death and rebirth of the human heart under the advent of (post)modern technology. At its worst, it’s a thoughtful (if overintellectualized) series of didactic morality tales, that portrays human emotion with glib amaurosis. Nevertheless, at least it tries to be thoughtful—placing it leagues ahead of most programs played on our own black mirrors. —Aziz B. Yakub

7. Atlanta
Ever wonder how Childish Gambino got signed? Well, “Atlanta” isn’t that story—though the rapper is its star and creator. Earning rave reviews in its first season, “Atlanta” follows protagonist Earn (Donald Glover) as he manages his up-and-coming rapper cousin Alfred Miles (Brian Tyree Henry). Caught between his real-life responsibilities of raising a daughter with his best friend (Zazie Beetz) and the demands of street life, Earn is the instrument through which Donald Glover fine-tunes his signature sense of humor while providing insightful commentary on Atlanta’s rap scene—and, by extension, its racial climate.

10. Full Frontal with Samantha Bee
It has Samantha Bee. It has Jo Miller. But most importantly, it has full frontal. After 12 years working for Jon Stewart’s “The Daily Show,” Bee has started her own show, a late-night news comedy program featuring her often awkward, always hilarious field reports. She interviews Trump voters, visits Syrian refugee camps, and travels to Moscow. Luckily for Bee (but perhaps unluckily for us), 2016 shaped up with just enough hot mess for fresh material each week. —Tianxing V. Lan

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It is a well-known fact that morally, professionally, ethically, and physically, I am as solid as a rock. A paragon of rugged, masculine reliability. A veritable slab of discipline. A productive quarry yielding up metric-ton after metric-ton of sheer bonhomie and can-do optimism. I’m the bona-fide Ruhr Valley of getting things done. The Venerable Bede, paraphrasing a bit of ancient folklore, once wrote: “While Adriano stands, Rome shall stand; when Adriano falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, the world shall fall.” It’s a heavy cross to bear, but I do so with equanimity and pluck.
As a testament to my unshakeable commitment to serving as the steady, thrumming motor of the Arts Board, I present to you some excerpts from blog pieces that I have totally written in a timely fashion for the Arts Blog. They’re there; I promise. You’re just not looking hard enough. I wouldn’t lie to you.
Music Video Breakdown—Emotional Mugger—
“What is it about this man that impedes his cameraman’s ability to keep his camera steady? Is it his gray one-piece? His triangle of matted, curly hair? This 15-minute epic has given me much, but this final answer remains elusive. Will report after the next 10 viewings.”
What the Hell Happened—Liberation of the Serfs?—
“I have tons of villein friends, and they all think Alexander II is making a catastrophic mistake.” 
MacGyver—
“I do, however, take issue with the continuity reboot inherent in this series revival. The original series had such a rich supporting cast and an intricate system of lore—the new series papers over all this. A more straightforward, in-universe sequel series would have perhaps have been more apropos. What diehard fan wouldn’t have liked to see ‘MacGyver 2: Son of MacGyver’ or ‘MacGyver in Hong Kong’ or even ‘Back From The Grave: MacGyver’s Last Stand,’ instead of the insipid rehash we received?”
What the Hell Happened—Ms. Pac-Man: The Patriarchy Wins Again—
“How are we, as modern consumers of the Arcade Game as Art, expected to reconcile Ms. Pac-Man’s staggering competence in the Maze with her willingness to abandon it? In a scant three cutscenes, external to the action, she meets, falls in love with, and conceives a child with her male counterpart, ostensibly sacrificing the inescapable maze of ghosts and pellets for the far more treacherous maze of the domestic sphere.”
What the Hell Happened—Dan Quayle: Hot or Not—
“Were it not for that shrew Marilyn Tucker, Vice President Quayle would undoubtedly hold the title of Washington’s Hottest Bachelor. That salt-and-paprika hair, that rugged jawline, those eyes—so soft yet so piercing, sparkling like an unscratched Laserdisc in the cool Indiana sun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The long debate on the College’s sanctions against final clubs and other unrecognized single-gender social organizations is set to reach another milestone next month when the Faculty of Arts and Sciences votes on a motion denouncing the policy. After a debate earlier this month on the motion, members of the Faculty are no doubt aware of the many points of contention on both sides of the issue. Recently, three points of data suggesting that students oppose the sanctions—one from a Crimson survey, and two from UC referendum questions, have entered the discussion.
While these data points are all interesting, we urge the faculty to set them aside and instead focus on the merits of the arguments for and against the policy. While all three data points suggest opposition to the sanctions, they still show a sizable portion of the student body in favor. Given the current tenor of the debate, we also suggest that the administration begin to take stock of why the sanctions have engendered this level of uncertainty from students.
Lamentably, the data currently available do not present reliable figures on students’ perspectives on the sanctions. In The Crimson's survey of the student body, for example, a significant 20 percent said they had no opinion, suggesting at the very least that student opinions may still be in flux.
The problems with the UC referendum results are even clearer. Though more students voted, turnout was still quite low, and faculty should not assume that it is representative. Furthermore, while one question was straightforward in asking students whether they thought the current sanctions should be repealed, a second one asked "Do you think the unrecognized single gender social organizations should have gender-inclusive membership by a means different than the current College administered sanctions?" This second question is quite difficult to understand and does not accurately reflect student opinion, as evidenced by the high number of abstentions. Given this added source of confusion, Faculty should be wary of accepting the results of either referendum as a guide to the undergraduate mood.
Nevertheless, there are lessons to be drawn from the unrest and ambivalence that have surrounded the prospective sanctions. They are the direct result of the lack of input that preceded their announcement. Solving issues of sexual assault and inclusion rest largely  on student buy-in, and consequently on consultation with students. While the Implementation Committee has made belated attempts to understand what students are thinking, these have only added to the confusion by making the policy’s exact contours less clear.

Ruben: What does a failed promise look like? It looks like an introductory literature course where the only thing whiter than the kids in your class is the syllabus. It sounds like people spitting that cultural groups are a form of self-segregation. It stings like the words of a high-ranking administrator explaining that Harvard doesn’t have a multicultural center because of philosophy rooted in the 1960s, as if Jim Crow didn’t have a grip on this country’s throat then.  A broken promise is seeing through the smoke screen of admissions pamphlets, looking at your brownness in a mirror, and wondering whose Harvard you’ve been admitted into.
Zoe: It’s constant reinforcement that my experiences aren’t considered enough. Being a woman of color, being low-income, being first-generation are thought to be the boxes checked on a college application, never to be acknowledged again as impacting my college experience. As if those labels that I live and breathe, that make up my identity, should no longer be considered significant after walking through the gates of Harvard. The University lacks resources that recognize my experience as a low-income student of color as being different from the experience of a white student from a high-income family. This only serves to reinforce that my identity isn’t important enough to be acknowledged outside of the classroom where I’m supposed to be the voice of diversity. I am constantly shown that my worth on this campus comes from my otherness, my unique identity, the brown color of my skin, but when it comes time to address those differences and how they have influenced my needs as a student, they are no longer important.
R: What, then, do we do with the promised support that is shattered to pieces by a tiny For Whites Only sticker? They cut our golden flesh, and once we’re able to control or bandage the bleeding, we speak out. We spend hours writing a column. We climb on statues. We plan protests. We do anything to get ears to listen and people to support us. We ignore those who tell us to be grateful for our place. They try convincing us that our spots were nothing more than affirmative action admissions and that they should have gone to another white male who’d be better off fulfilling his destiny by punching a final club. But we will not bleed forever, and we’ll keep fighting for support and change at this institution until the wound has scabbed over.
Z: To the College, I’m no more than a walking, talking number used to justify their claiming of the magical buzzword “Diversity.” I’m supposed to feel like a valued member of this college community. I’m supposed to believe that my perspective, my voice, is indispensable in a classroom dominated by white students from privileged backgrounds. I’m supposed to believe that this is just as much my college as it is theirs. But when I look to the front of my classroom I only see white men. When I receive counseling I have to scour page after page for a counselor who can address the intersectionality of my identity. When I want to receive funding as the treasurer of a cultural organization, I have to talk about it in terms of how it can educate the white majority about my culture rather than the more important reason: how it can create an otherwise nonexistent safe space for the minority students on this campus. I’m not just a word on an admissions website; my experiences aren’t labels thrown around like a currency to determine which top-tier institution has the most well-rounded student body, only to be forgotten when I arrive here. If this place truly wanted to acknowledge me as no different from anybody else, they would ensure I was supported in every capacity, they would hire people who came from backgrounds like mine thereby deeming them worthy enough, qualified enough, to teach, to counsel, within their prestigious walls.
R&Z: This country will not pretend any longer to be America for all equally. That is clear. So whose America are we living in? That question will inspire films, art, future columns, and years of forced confrontations with our ugly realities. Those conversations will be difficult—impossible for some—but while we grapple with that, we must make progress on this campus.
Harvard is no longer comprised only of the white elite, so we must think about why it’s still built to be for the white elite. If we must tear down certain pieces of this institution to rebuild it to better reflect the brown, black, and yellow bodies it currently crushes, then so be it. Even if we have questions about whose America we live in, we should not have questions about whose Harvard this is. We live in a borderland, on our fronteras, on the barbed wire, and in a painful liminal space. You, the reader, as you sit behind your screen or look down at our words in print, have heard what life is like on these borderlands. What will you do? Esto es nuestra realidad, ahora que harás?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Nov. 15, 2016, just one week after the presidential election, President Faust wrote a letter that envisioned a Harvard “enriched, not embattled, by difference and diversity” and called us to exercise “our capacities and our values” to heal this nation. In response to her bold proposition, we, the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, write appealing for critical ethnic studies at Harvard.
We believe that this is a pivotal moment to fulfill intellectual needs that have gone unaddressed for too long. The president-elect’s political platform was built on xenophobic, sexist, and racist rhetoric and policy proposals, which, even within the first few days of the election, have inspired hate crimes against many marginalized groups in the United States. We believe this calls for urgent action on Harvard’s part to be ever more proactive in educating "the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society," as the mission of Harvard College states, who are grounded in values of equity and justice.
Over the past 44 years, Harvard students have submitted 11 proposals for ethnic studies. Today, neither a concentration nor a department for ethnic studies exists at Harvard, while our peer institutions have established research centers, departments, and programs in ethnic studies. In his 1903 book “Souls of Black Folk,” W.E.B. Du Bois prophetically declared, “the problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,” but today’s political climate reveals that we have yet to overcome that color line. How can Harvard be a leading academic institution for the 21st century, and in this political climate, without an institutional commitment to the study of race and ethnicity in all of its multiplicity?
Currently, the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights, founded as the Committee on Ethnic Studies, offers only undergraduate secondary fields. Though many of us are members of the EMR community and have been nurtured by its affiliated faculty, EMR remains under-resourced, and its current structure is inadequate to meet the needs of students and faculty.
In addition, Harvard’s Department of African and African American Studies and Hutchins Center for African and African American Research indicate to us Harvard’s ability to create and fund scholarship at the forefront of studies of race and ethnicity. However, without similar strengths in other areas of the study of race and ethnicity, the University fails to undertake a comprehensive examination of differences between and across racial and ethnic identities as well as histories while risking the perpetuation of a black/white binary.
Students and faculty across schools and departments at Harvard have demonstrated their interest in and dedication to ethnic studies over the years. During the past year alone, we have organized teach-ins, town halls, and workshops on ethnic studies. Harvard students continue to pursue ethnic studies, even given the limited intellectual and material support from the University. We, then, find it incomprehensible that our institution continues to overlook our appeals and consequently fail to foster our intellectual growth.
Our proposal for structural change includes, but is not limited to, the following. Many of our concerns are also reflected in the recent petition to protect undocumented students.
We ask that Harvard establish a Department of Ethnic Studies, which would offer undergraduate concentrations and secondary fields in Native American and Indigenous Studies, Latinx Studies, Asian American Studies, Arab and Muslim American Studies, and Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies, as well as Ph.D. degrees and graduate-level secondary fields in Ethnic Studies. The University can only be a leading institution of learning by providing the necessary institutional structures for students to critically examine the historical and contemporary constructions of race and ethnicity.
In order to provide much-needed intellectual space for students, scholars, and faculty, we ask Harvard to also establish a center that would be a national and international hub for research in critical ethnic studies in comparative, national, transnational, and global frameworks. Currently, Harvard falls far behind its peer institutions as a host for research on race, ethnicity, and power. The center would promote intergenerational and interdisciplinary engagement by sponsoring a variety of events, including conferences, workshops, and seminars.
Lastly, it is critical that Harvard recruit and retain Ethnic Studies faculty and faculty of color by dedicating tenured, tenure-track, and visiting professorships for Ethnic Studies and its allied fields such as Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, and African and African American Studies. No academic program can be sustained without a community of dedicated and distinguished faculty and scholars.
We believe that now is the time to act—for the University to be at the forefront of teaching, learning, and research in an academic field that seeks to examine some of the most fundamental and critical questions of our time. Indeed, the University must renew its dedication to developing leaders who can make a difference at home and globally.

Ruodi Duan is a second year Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of History. Helen J. Kim is a fifth year Ph.D. Candidate in the Committee on the Study of Religion. Juhwan Seo ’17 is a joint Sociology and Studies of Women, Gender & Sexuality concentrator living in Leverett House. They write representing the views of the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition.
This op-ed is based on a petition to support ethnic studies at Harvard, which has more than 700 signatures from Harvard students and alumni. The petition has been officially endorsed by Asian American Association, Black Students Association, Chinese Students Association, Concilio Latino, Native Americans at Harvard College, and South Asian Association.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The battle for Yardfest has begun—20 weeks early.
Over the holiday break, a debate erupted between two Facebook pages promoting desired performers for the College’s annual music festival: Canadian pop singer Carly Rae Jepsen and electronic dance music duo the Chainsmokers.
The only problem? There is no shortlist for the concert yet.
Tensions flared among fans of the two acts on social media as rumors circulated they were in the running to perform at the College-wide event. The two fan bases marshaled forces for their preferred performer.
The Facebook pages, “Carly Rae Jepsen for Yardfest 2017” and “The Chainsmokers for Yardfest 2017,” both aimed at rallying support for their respective artist, gave rise to rumors that the artists had been chosen for the shortlist as the College Events Board made its selection. The social media frenzy at times focused on more than just the music—some in the Carly Rae Jepsen camp argued the Chainsmokers were too expensive.
The Jepsen Facebook page had garnered more than 250 "likes" by Monday night, compared to more than 450 for the Chainsmokers.
Amid the escalating dispute, the CEB issued a statement on their Facebook page denying rumors that they had created a shortlist, writing that while the board had “taken notice of the buzz surrounding some posts on other Facebook pages,” they were far from their final decision. They also urged students to respect “each other’s differing opinions” when advocating for their preferred artist.
“While Carly Rae Jepsen and The Chainsmokers had an impressive showing, there were also many other artists that students showed heavy support for. We have not made any offers, nor have we ranked artist options, thus, the information shared about Carly Rae Jepsen and The Chainsmokers being our top 2 artists is false,” the statement read.  “We love Carly Rae Jepsen, we love The Chainsmokers, but they are not our top 2 as we do not have a top 2 at this point in time.”
In a subsequent email, Kaysie J. Gonzalez ’18, co-chair of the CEB, clarified that the committee had still not settled on a shortlist of artists for the event.
The argument reached a boiling point after some students raised concerns that they found the Chainsmokers a troublesome choice to perform at the College-wide concert because of previous statements the artists have made. In one interview with Billboard Magazine, the two members of the Chainsmokers bragged about their genital size and said their goal in becoming famous was “to hook up with hotter girls.”
Nicholas Whittaker ’19, who was vocal on Facebook about his opposition to the Chainsmokers, said in an interview he was concerned after “seeing some things that the Chainsmokers have said, and the kind of attitude that they promote, especially towards women, and a general atmosphere that is kind of uncomfortable to a lot of us.”
The choice for Yardfest’s headlining artist has, in the past, sparked controversy among students. In 2013, when the CEB chose Tyga as the headliner, more than 1,000 people signed a petition to cancel the performance, citing some of the artist’s lyrics that they said were derogatory towards women.
The CEB in Saturday’s Facebook post said it welcomed debate and was “inspired by how vocal students have been about their support for the artists they suggested.”
Fans of Jepsen, best known for her hit single “Call Me Maybe,” expressed hope that the debate remain positive.
“I'm a diehard Carly Rae Jepsen fan but it seems to me a lot of people want the Chainsmokers, " Spencer Glesby, ’19 one of the students who started the Carly Rae Jepsen page, wrote in an email.
In its post, the CEB said it was taking all suggestions into “careful consideration” and would continue to welcome any feedback it received.

Get Team Jess and Team Logan from Gilmore Girls off your mind, because the real war is right in front of you, and it’s—naturally—about Yardfest 2017. The Class of 2019 Facebook group erupted with arguments this weekend while the rest of us were sleeping off our gobble wobble. The two factions are those who support Carly Rae Jepsen for this year’s Yardfest, and those who support The Chainsmokers, and of course, each side is violently opposed to the other.
Some background: rumor had it that the College Events Board was picking between these two artists, which brought the groups head to head. We‘re not entirely certain how much of the fight is sarcasm, but we’re pretty sure we know comedic gold when we see it.
If you’re trying to fill the gaping void that Harvard’s loss to Yale has left in your heart, it’s time to get involved in something else that only Harvard would take too seriously. Not entirely sold? We’ll help you choose.
The Chainsmokers
To paraphrase the Facebook spat, do you want the upcoming Yardfest to be a non-stop “certified banger”? Do you want music that’s more nuanced than “call me maybe?” Are you, like Alex Pall of the DJ duo, a self-proclaimed “frat-bro dude”? Look no further than The Chainsmokers. Yeah, okay, you’ve heard ‘Closer’ around a dozen times every weekend since it came out, but you can still get down to it! Yardfest isn’t really about the pinnacle of musical mastery, it’s about ending the year with a bang...er.
Carly Rae Jepsen
If you’re fighting on this side, the first and foremost requirement is that you abhor The Chainsmokers’ dudebro reputation and want an actual artist at Yardfest, thanks. If you think ‘Call Me Maybe’ is an underrated pop masterpiece, then you already know you’re Team Carly. In fact, you’re not even really reading this article; you’re already digging for more gross things The Chainsmokers have said. There’s only one person who can bring the right upbeat feel to Yardfest to you. Is it too soon to bring back #ImWithHer?
Staying neutral?
At this rate, you’re going to either sit Yardfest out, or intentionally pregame too hard. Don’t give up hope, though, because the CEB confirmed that they don’t haven’t whittled their list of potential headliners down to a top two yet. There’s still hope that Frank Ocean will get in the mix.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard College graduate turned third-party presidential candidate is grabbing national headlines this week after she launched an effort to recount votes in three states Donald Trump won in the 2016 presidential election.
Jill E. Stein ’72-73, the presidential nominee of the Green Party, has called for vote recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan because she believes the software used for electronic voting was hacked. The three states were key in Trump's upset victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton earlier this month.
But some Harvard professors said voters should not expect Stein's recount effort, which has raised $6.4 million of a $7 million goal, to overturn or substantively change the results of the election. 
“Recounts are useful in terms of guaranteeing the outcome is what it’s supposed to be, or what we thought it would be. They typically don’t shift more than 500 votes, one way or the other,” said Stephen D. Ansolabehere, a professor in the Government Department. But he noted that “there have been cases” where the recounts have reversed election outcomes.
David C. King, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School, said he believes Michigan should conduct a recount. Trump won Michigan with a 10,704 vote lead over Clinton—a result only announced Monday because of the close results.
“Michigan, for example, looks so close that they’re going to have to recount. Wisconsin, I don’t understand why there’s a recount going on because the outcome is not close enough to warrant one,” King said. “Recounts are helpful because they help us to refine our systems going forward, but I don’t think that we’ll find widespread problems with how the election was actually handled in terms of the machines and counting technology.”
Ansolabehere also said the recounts may reveal voting problems in individual towns.
“Having a decentralized system is a good thing. It gives you some resilience, because it’s hard to hack 8000 different towns at the same time,” Ansolabehere said. “The quality of town-level government administration determines the quality of election administration. So to the extent that we’re going to find things, it’s going to be in a very localized and decentralized way.”
Some Stein supporters have nevertheless stood by her recount effort. Ian Jackson—the treasurer for the Massachusetts branch of the Green-Rainbow Party—said the state organization raised $50,000 towards the recount since last Wednesday, when the party decided to throw their support behind Stein’s effort.
“We raised considerably less than them [the Stein campaign], but still stand ready to help with our donations if possible or appropriate, depending on what they need,” Jackson said. He criticized a series of tweets President-elect Donald Trump posted Sunday railing against the recount effort and "millions of people who voted illegally."
“I think that it behooves everyone to try to stick to factual information. If you don’t have facts to back it up, be quiet,” Jackson said. “What the Green Party and Jill Stein are trying to do is use a legal process to check those facts.”
Stein did not respond to request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Beginning next semester, the Q guide will likely contain a question about the affordability of course materials, Undergraduate Council Education Committee chair Scott Ely ’18 said at the UC’s general meeting Monday.
Students would be asked how much they estimated individual courses cost them, Ely said, emphasizing the Education Committee had received a “soft commitment” from administrators.  The change would be part of an ongoing effort by the committee to address the high course material costs on campus.
“That’s the first time in my memory that the UC has ever gotten anything with regard to the Q guide to actually happen,” Ely said. 
The change  to the Q guide, the College’s course and instructor evaluation system, would come after students criticized economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw for requiring students to purchase a $132 access code to an online textbook and set of online materials for the first time, with some arguing the change made the class too expensive.
For the majority of the UC’s meeting Monday, representatives debated funding a for-profit party equipment rental service, but ultimately chose not to fund the group this week.
As part of the Council’s Grant for an Open Harvard College initiative—which provides $30,000 in funding each year to projects that address priorities that fall under four “compelling interest” categories—the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee considered providing $5,000 this week to College Party Rentals, a startup created by Harvard student that rents party materials like speakers and lights to students at low cost.
Initially, the Student Initiatives Committee recommended against funding the group this week.
“We love the ideas, but we felt we didn’t have enough information to fund a full $5,000,” Student Initiatives Committee vice chair Alex Popovski ’19 said.
College Party Rentals co-founders Max Y. Hsiao ’18 and Daniel Um ’19 explained their goals and describing how they would use UC funding at Monday’s meeting.
“We want to provide a platform for students to be able to get speakers for a price they can afford,” Hsiao said. “We have a substantial inventory, but we want to build up more.”
Several representatives raised concerns with the for-profit status of the group, arguing that funding such an initiative would be a misuse of student term bill funds.
“I would be more than willing to support them if they were willing to register as a non-profit,” Mather House representative Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said.
UC Finance Committee chair William A. Greenlaw ’17, who ultimately voted against funding the group, said there was historical precedent on the UC for funding for-profit initiatives.
Although Oak Yard representative Michael Scherr ’20 proposed an amendment to the grants pack that would have provided funding to College Party Rentals, the amendment did not pass. Popovski said the Student Initiatives Committee would consider the group’s proposal again next week.
During the meeting, the UC also unanimously voted to spend $11,868 on the Finance Committee’s weekly grants pack to student organizations.
Elections for new committee chairs will take place this week, and elections for next year’s UC secretary and treasurer will take place during next week’s general meeting. Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18—who were recently elected next year’s UC president and vice president—will be sworn into office next week as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy ’98 called for medical professionals to be more engaged in healthcare policy-making decisions at a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event Monday night.
Murthy, a former Harvard Medical School instructor, began the event by addressing the nationwide “abuse” of prescription painkillers and other opioids, which he said is one of the most pressing public health issues today. Amitabh Chandra, a professor at Harvard Kennedy the school, moderated the discussion. 
In August, Murthy wrote a letter to American physicians asking for their help in combatting the opioid crisis, the first time the Surgeon General’s office had issued such a letter.
While Murthy admitted his confirmation process to become Surgeon General was contentious, he said he does not think his policy positions are controversial. He said he sent the letter because he believes that clinicians must not only prescribe medication but also educate people about health and medicine in ways the government cannot.
“I also believe that the scale of the crisis warranted it,” he said.
He also called for doctors and other medical professionals to expand their traditional roles beyond the offices and into public life. He said they not only need to safeguard the health of their individual patients, but also fight to improve the environments in which their patients live.
“It’s no longer enough for us to sit in our hospitals and clinics and hope that the healthcare system gets fixed, hope that social determinants [of health] get addressed, and when in fact we need to step up and be that voice that calls for some of that change,” he added.
When Chandra asked Murthy what changes Donald Trump, the president-elect of the United States, would make to public health policies, especially regarding substance abuse, Murthy said he thinks progress will be made on these issues in the coming years.
“This is an issue that has been bipartisan for a number of years now,” Murthy said.
Carl G. Streed, a research fellow at HMS, said he agreed with Murthy and enjoyed the discussion.
“His response around education was a good one because it reduces barriers to patient understanding and physician’s ability to actually engage with patients,” he said. “Once patients have actually heard about this issue they’re more willing to hear the doctor out on this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of alumni decried “excessive” compensation for executives at Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm that oversees its $35.7 billion endowment, in a letter sent Monday to the Harvard Corporation.
In the letter, 11 members of the Class of 1969 wrote that HMC executives do not deserve their compensation packages as endowment returns have remained “poor or mediocre.” 
In fiscal year 2016, the value of Harvard’s endowment dropped nearly $2 billion after HMC returned negative 2 percent on its investment portfolio. The negative returns combined with other financial flows, including the $1.7 billion HMC distributed to fund more than a third of Harvard's annual budget, resulted in the endowment’s drop in value. In the last few years, Harvard’s endowment performance has lagged behind that of many of its peers, including Yale.
In the letter, sent to the University’s highest governing body, the alumni presented an analysis that claimed that HMC executives have seen increases in compensation packages for nearly every year since the 2008 financial crisis, despite lackluster endowment returns. The alumni proposed that HMC alter its current compensation packages and increase transparency regarding payments to executives.
“The compensation given to the highest-paid employees of Harvard Management, extravagant in its own right, continues to be vastly disproportionate to performance,” the alumni wrote.
Emily Guadagnoli, an HMC spokesperson, wrote in an emailed statement that HMC will increasingly tie compensation to performance in coming years.
“Starting in fiscal year 2017, compensation paid to internal investment managers will tie a meaningful share of variable compensation to HMC’s overall performance,” Guadagnoli wrote, adding that “current and former employees will forfeit compensation that was held back in prior years” because of HMC’s losses in fiscal year 2016.
In 2014—the last year for which compensation data has been made public as part of Harvard’s tax returns—Stephen Blyth, then the CEO of HMC, made $8.3 million. Andrew G. Wiltshire, who has since retired as the head of alternative assets, made $10.4 million.
The impetus for the alumni letter was a PowerPoint presentation consulting firm McKinsey and Company created for HMC, the authors wrote. The McKinsey presentation, first reported by Bloomberg, quoted HMC employees calling the culture at HMC “lazy” and “stupid.”
This is not the first time this group of alumni has written to a Harvard president to express disapproval with the compensation of HMC executives. Led by David E. Kaiser ’69, the cohort of alumni wrote to former University President Lawrence H. Summers during his tenure as well as Faust in 2009, 2011, and 2014.
Following criticism in 2014, Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development Tamara E. Rogers ’74 penned a letter to alumni to argue that the salaries were justified.
The group’s letter comes as HMC undergoes a transition of leadership. N.P. Narvekar, formerly the head of Columbia’s endowment, will become the CEO of HMC in early December. He will succeed Blyth, who resigned in July after 18 months at the helm of the investment arm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust pledged to take steps to protect undocumented students in the wake of Donald Trump’s election, writing an email to Harvard affiliates Monday to “reaffirm our clear and unequivocal support for these individuals.”
In the email, Faust wrote the University will expand the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program at the Law School and bring immigration experts to campus to provide legal resources for undocumented students. Faust’s chief of staff Lars Madsen will also coordinate efforts across the University to advise undocumented students. 
The email also reiterated a message from Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. Riley last week stating that the department will not ask about the immigration status of Harvard affiliates or enforce federal immigration laws. Faust referenced existing University policies preventing Harvard from disclosing immigration statuses or allowing law enforcement officials seeking to deport affiliates to enter campus without a warrant.
“[T]here has been growing concern about the effect more aggressive enforcement of federal immigration laws could have on many students, scholars, and staff at Harvard, especially on students who are undocumented,” Faust wrote.
President-elect Trump pledged during his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants and overturn the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.  President Barack Obama established DACA by executive order in 2012 to provide temporary legal protection to qualifying undocumented young adults. About 40 undocumented students currently attend Harvard.
After Trump’s victory in the Nov. 8 presidential election, students circulated a petition calling on the University to appoint an administrator to support undocumented students, create an office for such students, and hire a mental health counselor with experience working with people facing deportation.
The petition had amassed more than 4,000 signatures as of Nov. 14, when hundreds of students gathered at a rally and presented the petition to administrators. A group of undocumented students also met privately with Faust to discuss their concerns and present proposals for administrative action, according to Paulo J. Pinto ’18, who is undocumented.
“[W]e recognize and share the deep anxiety that campaign rhetoric and proposals have created for many members of the Harvard community,” Faust wrote in her email.
Faust’s email also reaffirmed her “active support” of DACA and the DREAM Act, legislation that, if passed, would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented young adults. Faust joined other university presidents last week in signing a letter to political leaders defending DACA.
Faust’s email does not specifically name Harvard a “sanctuary campus.” In recent weeks, students at universities across the country have pushed for their schools to adopt this designation—a largely symbolic term without a clear definition. Administrators at Wesleyan University formally declared the school a sanctuary campus, specifying that the university will not discriminate against undocumented students or aid federal officials with deportations—policies Harvard currently follows.
“By the terms that President Faust has outlined in the email, I think it’s pretty much a sanctuary campus by the terms other universities have outlined,” Pinto said. “There’s no clear definition, but it’s just that the place [is] saying it supports undocumented students and will do everything it legally can to protect them, and I think Harvard is doing that.”
Pinto said he understands critics’ concerns that designating campuses as “sanctuary” would draw attention to undocumented students, making them targets of immigration authorities.
But undocumented student Daishi Tanaka ’19 said he thinks Harvard should send a message with a specific designation as a sanctuary campus, and was disappointed that Faust’s email did not do so.
While several undocumented students praised the University for taking concrete action to support undocumented students, they felt the measures she outlined are not sufficient.
Pinto reiterated student activists’ requests for an administrative office for undocumented students, and Ilian A. Meza-Pena ’17 said she was disappointed  Faust has not yet hired a designated mental health professional.
“From a holistic point of view, I think that the letter represents a lot of progress and I’m really happy for that progress, but at the same time there is more work to be done,” Tanaka said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Romantic comedies: a unique genre of movies simultaneously derided and adored by people across the country. Most importantly, they are perhaps my favorite guilty pleasure of all time.  Honestly, nothing compares to my love of romantic comedies; carb-filled foods, shocking tabloids, and long massages can all step aside when it comes to romantic comedies. Not only do I adore romantic comedies, I’ve surely watched most romantic comedies from 2000 onwards by this point. Of course, my love for this genre is not unique (if it were there wouldn’t be a million-dollar industry behind it), but there’s a reason for that. Romantic comedies are an idealist’s dream, and that’s what makes this guilty pleasure all the more special.
Romantic comedies are an ideal love story in an ideal world. The best ones follow a special formula: An independent, intelligent, beautiful woman with a job in the city meets a handsome, seemingly caddish but actually sweet guy. They don’t get along at first but somehow end up together against all odds. Sprinkle in an excellent soundtrack and this movie’s bound to be a hit. It’s dynamite for the typical idealist (i.e. most Harvard students). We dream of big things like an ideal government or ideal international relations, so why not aspire to have an ideal love life as well? Most relationships won’t follow this almost impossible pattern, but at least romcoms remind us to set the bar high when we search for love.
More importantly, however, the romantic comedy is so special because it’s nothing new. Consider “Pride and Prejudice:” It’s a book, of course, but it set the standard by which to judge romantic comedies. Full of ridiculous side characters and wonderful dialogue between Elizabeth and Darcy, it manages to be amusing and romantic but is also rife with social criticism. Romantic comedies today are capable of doing the same thing, poking fun at dating in the modern world and the perceptions of femininity and manhood. “27 Dresses” would be nothing without its interesting take on the marriage industry, and “Love Actually” does the same for Christmas, friendship, and even cross-cultural relations. There are plenty of ways to critique the world’s problems, but romantic comedies do so in a light way and add a good story as well.
Romantic comedies have more substance than people give them credit for. They provide a sort of cute standard for people to aspire toward; some social criticism; and in my case, unrealistic romantic expectations. Most importantly, though, they’re just fun to watch on a rainy afternoon!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For any student the transition to college can be tough; from figuring out classes to take, navigating campus, or finding their niche amongst the student body.
For student-athletes the process includes all of the above along with managing time with workouts, film sessions, practices, and games—going through that process twice can’t be easy.
For Taylor Rooks, however, it was just another day at the office.
“[The transition] has been pretty seamless, the coaching staff has been great and the team is awesome,” Taylor Rooks said. “The environment is very fun and competitive; that made the transition very smooth and easy,
Rooks is a junior forward on the Harvard women’s basketball team. She hails from Warren, N.J.,  where she played at Gill St. Bernard’s School in Gladstone, N.J. There she was a two-time New Jersey Gatorade Player of the Year, and her accolades earned her a scholarship to play Div-1 basketball for the Stanford Cardinals.
After limited time her first year with the Cardinals, Rooks sought a new opportunity. That new opportunity brought her back to the east coast and through the gates of Harvard.
Often considered the “Harvard of the West,” Stanford would appear to be a far cry from the Ivy League. When it comes to basketball, and despite the Cardinals being ranked 11th in the nation, the New Jersey native sees little difference between the programs.
“[Harvard and Stanford] are pretty similar,” Rooks said. “The academics and career services [here] are very good, and school along with sports is hyper competitive here. I wouldn’t even consider going from Stanford basketball to Harvard basketball as a step down.”
Due to NCAA transfer rules Rooks had to sit out her sophomore year, limited to practices and  watching games from the bench.
Rooks patiently waited all year to contribute to the team.
“Oh my god! After a year of sitting on the bench not being able to contribute on the court during games,” Rooks said.  “I’ve never been so amped to go out there and perform, and to really play and be a part of a team again. I’m just really excited.”
The patience would prove to be worth it as Rooks came in big for Harvard this past weekend against a visiting Fairfield squad.
After a close first half, it was clear the Crimson needed to lock down on defense to come out with a win Kelsey Carey, a senior forward for the Stags, was giving the Harvard defense a lot of trouble. At the half, Carey already had 14 points.
“I let that girl score an insane amount of points on me,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “Taylor Rooks was able to come in and drop a few points for us and give our team confidence. Having the ability to do that is a beautiful thing.”
On top of a struggling defense, the Crimson was struggling on the offensive end. Harvard’s field-goal percentage on the night was 35 percent, falling well below the team average on the season.
Harvard also shot 25 percent beyond the arc, making only four three-pointers despite averaging 8.6 on the season.
On the night where the usually prolific shooting of the Crimson was absent, Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith needed a spark from the bench, and that spark came in the form of Rooks.
In response to a poor night of shooting, Harvard crashed the boards and outrebounded the overwhelmed Stags 48 to 33, with 15 of the boards coming off the offensive glass—an effort spearheaded from beginning to end by Rooks.
“We adjusted to the fact that we weren’t hitting the shots that we normally do,” Nunley said. “In response we crashed really hard, and I don’t think they were expecting that.”
Rooks would finish the game with six points, four blocks, and 10 rebounds. The junior’s defensive production would prove invaluable on a night where defense was the difference between a victory and a defeat for Delaney-Smith’s squad.
Behind three points, four rebounds, and a block from Rooks in the fourth quarter, Fairfield was limited to only seven points in the last quarter.
“The way I feel about this team is someone’s going to [step-up] and do something,” Delaney-Smith said. “Taylor Rooks came up and did something.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow night Patrick Steeves ’16 will be lacing them up under the lights of Lavietes Pavilion once again—this time, however, he won’t be donning the familiar Harvard uniform he wore as an undergraduate.
After missing his first three seasons at Harvard due to a recurring injury, Steeves comes back to Cambridge as George Washington faces off against the Crimson (1-3) tomorrow. Suiting up for the Colonials (3-3) as a graduate student with two years of NCAA eligibility due to his injuries as an undergraduate, Steeves comes into the matchup averaging nearly five points and three rebounds per game for George Washington.
On a Harvard squad that often struggled to muster offense last season, Steeves averaged more than nine points and nearly four rebounds a game. The most memorable of his performances last season came on Senior Night against Princeton; playing against a Tigers squad still vying for the Ivy League title, Steeves dropped 25 points, hit the go ahead free throw and the game winning block.
While the storyline of tomorrow’s matchup will without a doubt be centered on Steeves, the game is one that’s still important for both squads. After losing each of their first three games by single digits, the Colonials are riding a three game winning streak. Harvard, on the other hand comes into the game having dropped two in a row to Holy Cross and UMass and remaining winless against Division I teams.
Coming into the matchup, both squads couldn’t be more different. George Washington comes in with a clearly defined scorer in another graduate student, Tyler Cavanaugh. After leading the Colonials in scoring last season, Cavanaugh leads George Washington not only in scoring, but also in rebounding and assists with averages of 18.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 2.7 assists.
The Crimson is still looking for some degree of consistency amidst an undefined lineup. Despite the constant adjustments, the Crimson boast one of the best freshman classes in the nation and a deep bench.
“The lineup thing is not really a big deal for us because we work together with different people in practice; it’s not like we have a first line, second line. ” co-captain Siyani Chambers said. “One day you’re playing with one group and the next day you’re playing with a totally different group of guys.”
After taking last season off due to a knee injury, Chambers’ has returned to Harvard and is the team’s “quarterback”, as Tommy Amaker refers to him. Chambers is responsible for running the offense and being a vocal presence on the floor, especially on such a young team. Through four games he is averaging 8.7 points and a team high five assists per game.
Despite Chambers’ successful return, senior forward Zena Edosomwan has yet to live up to his standout junior season. Averaging just 15 minutes a game, the senior is averaging 3.5 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.
“What we need is to maybe have a bit more production from veteran guys,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[Chris] Egi, Zena, Siyani, Corey [Johnson], Tommy [McCarthy]—they need to play like veteran guys and we aren’t necessarily getting it from them.”
Despite the lack of production from the Crimson’s veterans, Harvard’s freshman have seen significant minutes. Through Harvard’s four games, all seven of Harvard’s freshman have seen the floor with Bryce Aiken, Henry Welsh, and Seth Towns all averaging over 20 minutes per game.
“It’s hard to ask much more from younger players like that, but you know again this is college basketball and you can have some solid numbers and not win,” Amaker said. “The goal for us is to really play well.”
After scoring a season-high 21 points against Stanford in Shanghai, Aiken has struggled since returning to campus. Against Fisher, Aiken scored two points on 1-of-8 from the field and against UMass last week Aiken failed to make a field goal, going 0-of-9 from the field while adding six points from the charity stripe.
Welsh has been one of the lone sources of consistency on Harvard’s young squad. He comes into tomorrow’s matchup averaging 8.3 points and seven rebounds per game. Facing an experienced George Washington squad, consistency might just be the key to a Crimson victory.
“You’d like to see if you can teach by playing better and winning but this is where we are,” said Amaker. “We are hopeful that we can utilize it to advance our growth and development for this year.”

Ever wondered how to make your Monday nights a little more exciting? Swing by 14 Plympton Street to join The Crimson’s Arts board in their weekly writers meeting. Bring this drinking game and a bottle of vodka, and you’ll fit into the family right away.
Disclaimer: I don’t actually drink. I don’t remember anything I learned from DAPA. And these things happen a lot during your average Arts meeting. Play at your own risk. For 21+.
Take a shot every time outgoing and incoming theater exec Trevor J. Levin ’19 fumbles to play “The Final Countdown” when two compers stand up to fight to the death for a pitch.
Take a shot if you thought “fighting to the death” meant actual fighting and were disappointed when all they did was play rock, paper, scissors.
Take a shot every time a comper chickens out of playing rock, paper, scissors. We want a bloodbath, not this incessant politeness.
Take a shot every time you’re a little freaked out that so many execs get weirdly excited about rock, paper, scissors.
Take a shot every time someone references a previous exec who wasn’t around when you comped. Who’s Natalie Chang?
Take a shot every time a writer struggles to do simple math in a game of numbers. 31 - 17 = ?.
Take a shot every time the aforementioned writer gives the excuse: “We’re Arts! We don’t do math!”
Take a shot every time someone stands up to get a can of lukewarm PBR.
Don’t take a shot if the PBR is actually chilled.
Take a shot every time your answer to the week’s artistic question is stolen.
Take two shots every time “Shrek” is mentioned.
Take a shot every time incoming Editor-at-Large Grace Z. Li ’19 doesn’t have an answer to the week’s artistic question and humbly accepts “Shrek.”
Take a shot if you think that outgoing film executive Shaun V. Gohel ’18 should drop out of school and do movie voiceovers instead based on his high-quality, somewhat dramatic film pitches.
Take a shot every time someone makes the pun “life’s a pitch.”
Take a shot if outgoing Arts co-Chair Ha D.H. Le ’17 is sitting on the Crimson chair. Take two shots if outgoing Arts co-Chair Victoria Lin ’17 is.
Take three shots if the Crimson chair has been stolen by a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
Take a shot every time a comper stole a pitch you wanted. Additionally, shoot the comper death glares from across the Sanctum.

—Grace Z. Li is the incoming Arts Editor-at-Large and designated driver for all upcoming Arts socials. Here’s to being the only sober person in the room!

All the Small Things
As Arts works in ever greater harmony with the rest of The Crimson following its integration into the daily paper, the board and its content approach the asymptotic workplace ideals of professionalism, efficiency, and relevance. Only the arts calendar, a list of upcoming Boston-area arts events printed weekly on page 3, retains those qualities that characterize the true artistic masterpieces of the recorded Crimson Arts canon: last-minute compilation, authorial hot potato, and an utter lack of concern for the opinions of those who would gaze upon it. Rather than strive to erase these last traces of irresponsibility, the Arts board must embrace the arts calendar as the pièce de résistance of its artistic ethos. The haste, the palpable reluctance, the barely-suppressed resentment with which our calendar is written—those things, my friends, are revolution. Those things are art.
Victoria is a Punk Rocker
Since joining The Crimson, I have most notably assumed the administrative role of Problem Child in my long-term partnership with Ha D.H. Le ’17. My two percent contribution to chair emails and zero percent contribution to meeting agendas render me uniquely qualified for the conscious slacktivism required of my vision of the Calendar exec.
Anarchy on the Arts Board
To compensate for the increasingly reader-facing nature of the rest of our content, we need a corresponding decrease in the degree to which our calendar gives a crap about what everyone else thinks. Below, I outline several initiatives that would best preserve the punk-lite rebellious spirit of the Arts board through the calendar:
Respectfully submitted,Victoria Lin ’17
Dropdown: Charger exec
(499.9999999998 words)
—Victoria Lin ’17 is the outgoing Arts Chair and prospective incoming Arts Calendar exec. She is planning to spend her retirement from The Crimson moored off the coast of Los Angeles with her Best Friend Ha D.H. Le ’17, where she will hopefully never have to wear nail polish again.

At the end of each year, members of The Crimson submit their candidacy for executive positions in a process called the Turkey Shoot. Attached is one proposal for an arts associate editorial position, somehow lost during this year’s shoot but now found.
The Calendar’s Overture
2016 brought huge changes for The Harvard Crimson’s arts section. With our transition into the daily, we now reach a larger, more diverse readership. But what do these readers first see when they turn to the arts pages? Page 3: a carefully designed Arts banner, a well-written feature and equally well-photographed image, and our section’s ugly duckling—the arts calendar. It’s time for a revival. It’s time to overhaul the arts cal.
Who am I? I’m [Harvard ID Redacted]
Since joining The Crimson exactly 1,038 days ago, I have compiled the arts cal two times—in other words, 0.192678227 percent of my time with 14p has been with the calendar. With my clear adeptness at mathematics and equally clear devotion to the arts cal, I would bring incredible experience to the calendar exec role.
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes (Turn and face the cal)
The arts cal has used the same format and system since the beginning of Arts itself. While I understand huge change will face resistance, I propose several actionable measures that will make the transition smoother:
Respectfully submitted,Ha D.H. Le
Dropdown: Charger exec
(499.9999999999 words)
—Ha D.H. Le is the outgoing Arts Chair and prospective incoming Calendar exec. She is planning to spend her retirement from The Crimson moored off the coast of Los Angeles with her Best Friend Victoria Lin, whose nails she plans to paint every day.

As the year draws to a close, it comes time to reflect, or maybe in the case of 2016, to forget. The past 12 months have been quite a ride, not the carnival kind but rather the 12-hour-drive-with-six-siblings kind of ride. But art—ambiguous, sometimes incoherent, often intelligible art—can express every damn bit of 2K16’s ups and downs. So these are eight moments from this past year that are particularly deserving of visual manifestation.
BREXIT—“The Creation of Adam,” Michelangelo
This summer, the UK voted to leave the European Union. Much like God breathing life into Adam’s fingertips in Michelangelo’s “The Creation of Adam,” the EU has nothing but warm wishes for its British divorcees.
HUDS STRIKE—“The Potato Eaters,” Vincent Van Gogh
For 22 days, HUDS workers went on strike, coaxing students to find creative ways to satisfy food anxieties—not unlike those in Van Gogh’s “The Potato Eaters.”
PABLO BEGINS LIFE—“The Birth of Venus,” Sandro Botticelli
Kanye West dropped “The Life of Pablo” in February, leading to, among other things, a TIDAL lawsuit, a music video featuring a nude George W. Bush, and the release of a secretly recorded telephone conversation with Taylor Swift. And a whole lotta Nike sales. The genesis was no less extraordinary than Sandro Botticelli’s “The Birth of Venus.”
YALE WINS THE GAME—“The Scream,” Edvard Munch
After nine years of good old-fashioned Harvard wins, Yale had the nerve to subject fans to not only an upsetting win but also the Saybrook Strip.
TRUMP WINS AMERICA—“The Fountain,” Marcel Duchamp
Donald Trump was elected President of the United States, and the country fulfilled all of Marcel Duchamp’s predictions in “The Fountain.”
CONGRESS LEGALIZES MEDICAL MARIJUANA— “Pie Counter,” Wayne Thiebaud
Early in 2016, Congress nixed the federal ban on medical marijuana, rendering life for many even more reminiscent of a Wayne Thiebaud spread.
HARAMBE—“Campbell’s Soup Cans,” Andy Warhol
In May, a gorilla was unjustly murdered, reminding the world of the evils of capitalism, much like what Andy Warhol tried to do in 1962.
BRANGELINA DIES—“The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” Damien Hirst
As of 2016, Brangelina is no more. Only Damien Hirst’s shark tank masterpiece, “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” can truly capture how the breakup made us feel: Celebrities really are all that different from us.
—Rebecca H. Dolan is the incoming Campus Arts exec. She never watched the original “Gilmore Girls” series, so she has no frame of reference to judge the revival.

Brief Bio: Aside from collecting Virginia Slim-smoking mistresses, feeding pigeons the last crumbs of the stale baguette I rummaged out of the trash can (with extremely pathos-laden facial expressions and gestures, in anticipation of my lead role in an artsy film made by a semi-depressed Coppola exile), and getting in bar fights with Ernest M. Hemingway and Meg P. Bernhard, I also lead a student tour at the Fogg, “Vegetables of the Orient.” My Tinder bio is going on display at the MoMA this coming January. I have a lot of stamina*.
Column Description: A column about columns.
Ideas:
1. Great Art reimaginings:
a. The Sound and the Columnb. Tha Column III—and IV and Vc. This is How You Column Herd. If You’re Reading Columns It’s Too Latee. The Column (John Grisham)f. Mona Columng. Column Me Thru the Phoneh. Anna Columnina
2. A review of a fellow columnist’s review of peer-reviewed column literature
3. Guest Column by James Wood: Consciousness and Libido in Equatorial and Martian Colonial Postwar Columns
4. Miscellaneous questions and answers:a. How many columnists does it take to change a lightbulb?i. Answer: Four. One to change the lightbulb; one to pour sweat and soul into a five-installment column elucidating the subtle human pathos of the experience, which will then be relegated to a dime-sized icon in the lower left hand corner of the Arts website; and one to replace the second one after she dies of grief and consumption, but who will shortly defect/realize he’s a masochist/succumb to his lifelong pipe dream of being a frat star and comp FM/News/Biz, after which the columns editor will resign, comp the Advocate for the 17th time, and need to be replaced as well.
b. How many columns does it take to be Greek?i. What’s the difference between a Greek and a Roman column?
c. On Wikipedia, what’s the smallest number of clicks it takes to go from “Column” to “Illuminati”? How about “Column” to “Suicide”? to “Postmodernism”? “Gristle”?
d. Does the word “column” actually mean anything to anyone anymore? Kind of tastes like mushy HUDS hash browns in my mouth.
5. After submitting my vanity, I read all of my fellow execs’ vanities and realized that I had a lot more leeway than I thought I did, because we had essentially infinite leeway; this breaks my heart because if I had time to go back and rewrite this vanity it would definitely be about Drake or Lil Wayne—actually, no, let’s be honest, definitely Lil Wayne. A few days ago I got a slightly confrontational email from a woman who claimed to be Lil Wayne’s current girlfriend, and it was the best thing that’s ever happened to me.
*can someone please define this for me
—Outgoing Columns exec Emily Zhao ’18 is 1 to 5 against Ernest M. Hemingway as of yesterday but beats Salvador D. F. J. Dalí in a fight every time.

Coloring Book by Chance the Rapper
Time: 2007 hours. The Crimson’s arts section’s blank pages wait to be filled. Final edits have yet to be made and pieces still need to be seconded, but the fun has only just begun. After all, How Great are the Arts exec Angels, who have No Problem slaving about All Night? All We Got to do is Juke (and) Jam until we get to the Finish Line. Does everything make sense yet? Is anything organized as of now? Not quite, but we’ll get there soon enough.
Dive Bomber and Tank by Jose Clemente Orozco
Time: 2337 hours. Anguish, fear, despair. The looks on the execs’ faces say it all. Doom and disaster are imminent as the poor souls get sucked into their computer screens, machines that will chew them up and spit them out when all that’s left are their tears. A red light glints from the blinding screens—the machines are running on less than 20 percent of the juice they need to make it through the night. The wretched editors try desperately to finish up for the night before time is up, but secretly they pray for the relief at which the red light hints. Let the red light shine! Let the screens turn black! But then… what of the week’s Arts issue?
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest by Ken Kesey
Time: 0044 hours. A savior has arrived with a long white cord. Jamming it into the computers, the execs bolt up, electrified awake. As the computers charge up, their captives lose hope of having the reprieve they had dreamt of all night—or is it day now? A savior, was the cord-carrying fiend? Nay, the devil, come to nurse the sufferers further into the insanity they’ve already spun themselves into. Will Ha and Victoria be a strong enough force for good to counter the darkness?
Breaking Bad
Time: 0128 hours. On the verge of psychotic breaks themselves, Vic and Ha turn to illicit manipulation to force the execs into action. Nothing is off limits: Bribery with snacks and soda, blackmail with the most depraved secrets, and selling the darkest of drugs—caffeine—are just a few of the many tactics used as a last ditch effort to get the job done. But when does evil ever prevail?
The Incredibles
Time: 0148 hours. Change of tactics. Like in any superhero movie, teamwork and perseverance save the day—or rather, Crimson Arts. Elizabeth’s quiet strength and Thomas’ steady pragmatism complement Vic and Ha’s infallible leadership, and coupled together, the sets of incoming and outgoing Arts chairs rally their comrades to finish yet another issue of Crimson Arts. Exhausted but proud, the Arts execs have once again produced the arts section. Finally, Vic and Ha can rest knowing they’ve done their job well. After all, with great power comes great responsibility… Wait, isn’t that from Spiderman?
—Staff writer Mila Gauvin II is the incoming Books exe… Wait, “II” as in “the second?” What is she, a princess? (Upon further research, it would appear that Mila Gauvin II is not a princess, but in fact a queen. Please excuse any other implication.)

1. Space your content out over as many pages as possible. That way everyone has to click through multiple pages to read the whole article, and clicks are life. As your content-to-page ratio approaches zero, your article’s value approaches infinity. All right, not infinity, because the industry’s in rough shape, but probably a bit more than it was before.















2. Apparently Arts also comes out in print? Hm. Figure out how to make Arts more useful for constructing papier-mâché parade floats or whatever it is people are doing with the print issue. (Side note: Figure out what people do with the print issue.)














3. Most art is kind of boring, so try to find pictures of something that’s not boring and make that the image for the article. Readers who don’t speak English will be fooled and think the article is actually about the exciting photo! What do a concert in Boston and this adorable cat have in common?
Nothing, and also I don’t really like cats, but statistically a lot of you clicked just to find that out.











4. Your titles should be exactly seven words, because seven is the best length to get your article clicked on. Short enough for readers to gulp down like shots in Arts’ “Shrek” drinking game (drink every time you see Shrek!); long enough that they feel like they learned something. Not six, not eight. Seven words. (Side note: Seriously, though, where are all these print issues going? They seem to be everywhere, and I’m very confused.)













5. Apparently your writers and fellow execs don’t really like BuzzFeed journalism, but they also want to boost Arts readership. This is a problem because your main plan for boosting Arts readership was to plagiarize BuzzFeed. Tell everyone that you have a secret plan to boost Arts readership without using any kind of clickbait journalism.















6. Uh-oh, now you’re chair and you forgot to come up with a secret plan! This is very embarrassing and also looks like it’s going to be a lot of work. You’d better try to sneak out when no one is looking. You can camouflage yourself with some of the spare Crimson print issues lying around.

















7. Outline before you write your title. If you promise seven stunning tips for boosting Arts readership, be sure you can actually deliver seven, rather than just six. (Side note: Frankly, six sounds pretty good to me. No need to get greedy.) If you do promise seven and only come up with six, however, console yourself with the knowledge that nobody is going to click all the way to page 7 to find out.

—J. Thomas Westbrook is the outgoing Blog exec and incoming Arts Chair. He claims to do some actual journalism in his spare time, but if a tree falls in the forest and no one’s around to hear it, can it really be fact-checked? (No.) Please direct all administrative questions to elizabeth.keto@thecrimson.com.

Dear Arts readers (or as Ha still likes to say, Arts baes),
We’re excited to present the 2016 Arts Year-in-Review—our special supplement that continues a time-honored tradition (by which we mean since 2013). Using the results of an extensive campus-wide survey, we have ranked the year’s best films, music, books, TV shows, campus theater productions, and more.
The Crimson Arts’ mission has always been to educate our writers, inform our community, and offer commentary on our generation’s creative and artistic projects. To that end, we are grateful to have had the opportunity to both report and critique. We like to think that we’ve made great strides in 2016: We have revitalized our blog section, facilitated a transition into the Tuesday and Friday daily paper of The Harvard Crimson, focused on greater inclusivity and accessibility in our coverage, and increased the research and breadth of our front features to focus on topics such as diversity in the Music Department, comedy on campus, and the relationship between art and service.
Before we leave you to reflect on the year in arts, we’d like to thank all of our execs, staff writers, compers, and designers for their time and dedication; our design execs Uju S. Nwosu ’17 and Tiffany K. Lam ’18 and our multimedia exec Katherine L. Borrazzo ’18 for their devotion to creative and engaging designs and photos; Managing Editor Meg P. Bernhard ’17 and President Mariel A. Klein ’17 for their support and guidance throughout 2016 to ensure the quality of our online and printed Arts writing; and finally you, our readers, for your ongoing interest in our features, reviews, columns, and other content.
We would also like to congratulate our successors, Elizabeth C. Keto ’18 and J. Thomas Westbrook ’18. While we’re sad to set sail for new waters, we know that incredible hands will be steering the arts section into 2017.
With gratitude, relief, and (most importantly) Arts love,
Ha D. H. Le ’17 and Victoria Lin ’17Arts Chairs, 143rd Guard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Five hundred twenty-five thousand, six hundred miiinutes! After almost a year of serving Crimson Arts as theater executive, I, a wee sophomore, the Boy Wonder of the Arts Board, was ready to move on to bigger and better—hell, I would’ve taken “different”—things. But nobody else was willing to step up to the plate, so I’m back for round two. My theory: People didn’t apply to be theater exec because they didn’t know what it’s like to be theater exec. So, current and future Arts writers, please find below a summary of the position’s weekly responsibilities. HRDC, please see disclaimer in tagline.
MONDAY
7:29. Pitch a piece at the Writers Meeting. Really talk it up, or else no one will take it. “Come on, guys—a classic play with a cool, relevant spin! Two tickets, so you can bring That Special Someone to a classy night on the town!” No one picks it up. An hour later, email the pitch to the Arts listserv. Pass the evening editing last week’s pieces at Arts production night at the Crimson. You wait all night, but nobody picks up your piece. Decide to review the show yourself.
TUESDAY-THURSDAY
Contemplate asking That Special Someone, or anyone at all, to a night at the Theater.
FRIDAY
7:18. Well, it’s 7:18, and you don’t have a date. Message your blocking group to see if anyone wants to catch a play. Nobody does. Maybe you should stop asking producers for two tickets.
7:46. Ask the girl at the will call booth for your tickets. “Two, right?” she asks. “Nope, just me,” you say with a smile and a shrug. Find a seat around the middle of the house. Take out your Moleskine, so if anyone sees you, they will (correctly) assume you are a smart, on-top-of-things Theater Critic, not just some loser alone at the theater on a Friday night.
7:55. Scan the program. Preemptively dock the play a couple points because the director failed to cast you in his show freshman fall (back when you had the guts to make art, not sit behind a computer screen and point out how the strong man stumbles). Hey, that’s that guy and girl from your seminar. Are they a thing? You know what, good for them, making it work. It’s hard. Or so you hear.
8:44. Hey, the female lead is cute! She’s pretty good at acting, too, you guess. Start to worry that this show might be well done, meaning some creativity might be necessary to exact vengeance on the director. Doze off. Oh, Jesus, how much of the show did you just miss? It’s ending! You only saw half the play. It’s fine. You took good notes.
SATURDAY
3:08. Start writing. Formulaic intro paragraph. Praise the cute female lead, obviously, and show’s concept and Relevance. God, can someone do a show at Harvard that doesn’t have the bleakest possible themes? Let’s check on the compers’ pieces: Oh, good, the preview of the show about the futility of war came in clean; the one about depression looks fine, too; but the review of the show about sexual assault, racism, and despair is late, so that’s no good.
4:45. Wrap up. Wait, you didn’t exact vengeance! Say the lighting was, like, “inconsistent” or something. Yeah, that’s more a lighting designer thing than a director thing, but, you know, the buck stops there. Who gives a shit?
—Trevor J. Levin is both the outgoing and incoming Boy Wonder theater exec. He would like to reassure members of the Harvard theater community that this piece—like some perfectly performable works of theater, by the way—was written as levity. He does not have, nor has he ever had, a man-bun, which should really just be called a “bun.” #MasculinitySoFragile

So, here’s the thing.
We reviewed a lot of books this year. A lot of really good books, actually: “Swing Time” by Zadie Smith, “Imagine Me Gone” by Adam Haslett, “Float” by Anne Carson. By all accounts, a strong pool of candidates for the top honors.
For some reason, though, you asshats voted for “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” as the best book of 2016. (I’m not even going to talk about “Miscellaneous Adult Coloring Books.”) This is nothing more than an egregious, humiliating, horrifying mistake—maybe even a Donald Trump-level upset—for the following reasons:
(Heads up on some minor spoilers.)
1. The thing sounds like fan fiction. Bad fan fiction. Fan fiction written by my 13-year-old self, username: “teamdramione15xoxo.”
2. Hermione would not have become nasty, mean, or vindictive without Ron. She’s inherently kind and also a totally awesome feminist icon who don’t need no man. (Down with the patriarchy.)
3. Ginny is smart and awesome and good for a lot more than making sympathetic mom noises at everyone. (Down with the patriarchy.)
4. Ron is not a jokester. That’s Fred and George. All having the same red hair ≠ all being the same person.
5. It should really take more than a mildly embarrassing moment in high school to make someone pledge their life to an inhuman wizard Nazi.
6. Unclear how a fragment of an evil soul attached to another soul via a backfired curse can be genetically transmitted.
7. “Minister for Magic” or “Minister of Magic?” Different. Could have been sorted out ahead of time with a simple Google search or a post on Yahoo! Answers.
8. Voldemort had sex. Voldemort had a child. Okay. First, Voldemort’s whole goal was to live forever all by himself because he thought he would never be defeated. There would be absolutely no reason for him to want or need an heir. Second, Voldemort scorns anything resembling dependence, affection, or intimacy, but you’re telling me that he had sex?! On that note, his body was vaguely humanoid, but that’s pretty much it. He didn’t seem to eat or sleep, so there’s not a lot of indication that normal sexual functioning was a thing. So, basically, ew.
9. Trolley witch. I just… I can’t.

At its pinnacle, art deconstructs the fluid fabric of time, elevating experience into inescapable infinitude, elucidating the contours of inexpressible minds. But some experiences are so deeply traumatizing—so heinous—that nothing short of divine intervention could result in the annals of memory allowing their existence to persist: “Trevor Sucks” by Big $haun is one such experience (alternatively spelled “TrevOr $U.c K.’s,” pronounced “Trev, Or Dollar Sign U. c K.’s”—the c being a soft c, akin to the French cedilla). It is nothing short of a paean to the lowest form of human consciousness—a polemic to post-thought modernism.
The dissemination of its despicable lyrical intonations feels morally reprehensible (but alas, my editors have forced me to write these words). “Trevor Sucks” begins with a six-minute 66-second assemblage of sounds from the sonic stomach of Satan. In a seeming response to the abrasive introductory synths of “Yeezus,” the opening sound of this affront to moral goodness is the slick splat of spit accumulating in a man’s mouth, only to be ejected onto his hand a few seconds later. Slowly, and ever the more horrifying for it, the saliva-covered hand slowly rubs against rustling hair, concluding in the song’s climax: a staccato snap, presumably of a hair tie, and a sound of despicable relaxed affirmation. Then, for the first time, we hear $haun’s macabre marble mouth pronounce: “Fuck your man bun.”
The title single, sadly, suffers the same fate as the intro. With metaphysical bankruptcy $haun promulgates, “Elucidating obvious audiences with my hydrolysis / my mind fires lyrical bullets faster than Aroldis / Chapman for all you chemists / STEADY STATE THEORY 1914 / Fuck your man bun.” The historical inaccuracies of these lines are deeply problematic: David Chapman, the lesser figure in the Chapman triple entendre (the other two being Aroldis, the baseball player, and Mark David, John Lennon’s assassin), proposed the steady state hypothesis in 1913—not 1914.
The stand out single (and by stand out, the writer wishes to make this song stand outside in the cold, freeze to death, have its corpse meet the fate of Polynices and then, naturally, burn in eternal hellfire—if hell is nonexistent, the writer will personally build a pyre) is “Cut The Fucking Man Bun.” Its melody features an organ from the French classical school undergoing parallel key modulation while simultaneously achieving polytonality; waiting with six-second pauses is $haun, who pronounces a series of seemingly random numbers. However, synthesizing every sixth number, adding consecutive multiples of .6 (rounded down) and assigning it a letter value produces a disgusting message: “Cut the man, bun.” Trevor should, of course, keep the man bun—and bring about the apocalypse: A world in which “Trev.or $U.c K.’s” exists is a world that does not deserve to endure.

After all, it is 2016. It is no longer about modernism. It’s not even about post-modernism. It’s post-art anti-aesthetic late-capitalist nihilism—in one word, apocalypse. We know for a fact that God is an overweight middle-aged white man eating burritos and watching “The X Factor,” who spends way too much of his time on social media. Jean-Luc Godard put it well: “First there was Greek civilization. Then there was the Renaissance. Now we're entering the Age of the Ass.” So as art enthusiasts, we inevitably find ourselves facing the question: If it is truly the Age of the Ass, why are we still concerned with any art that is not ass?
We certainly don’t make art to impact society. If the purpose of art is to change something, then it should be evaluated by how much it changes this something. Most great artists, however, separate themselves from the mainstream culture, and most good art never reaches—not to mention impacts—ordinary people. If one really wants to spread a message around the world, she should resort to YouTube instead of museums and become a porn star instead of a sculptor. Of course, artistic media such as photography and film remain powerful weapons for social activists, but those people use them in different ways from artists. Admittedly, there’s an intersection where good art is accessible to the general public, but no one should confuse the two as the same thing. Which is to say, while art might sometimes give a damn about positive impact, it usually doesn’t, really.
Art is about not making an impact. We’re really tired of it—impacting this, impacting that, impacting each other so that we can all go and impact the Third World. We find this whole vicious cycle kind of dumb and want to just chill for a bit and find something fun to play with. We decide to give a name to this thing that we are playing with, so we call it “art.” At first we play with things that are beautiful, but then we run out of beautiful things or we get tired of them, so we start to play with unbeautiful things. Some people call these things “modern art,” and others call them “I could have also created those Mondrian paintings. Why can’t I earn five million dollars from that?” It is because he came up with it before you.
Many artists are sensitive. Some of them are extremely kind; others, absolute assholes. Either way, they need to pay great attention to the world around them while keeping a proper distance from it. They need to spend a lot of time on their own, thinking and feeling. After one year of contemplation, they finally get to work and write down three sentences or film one shot. But those three sentences and that one shot are so beautiful that they make us want to take a pause from our busy and often confusing lives and to have in mind nothing but these little artistic fragments. When such moments happen, we think art is worth it.
—Tianxing V. Lan is the outgoing Campus Arts exec and incoming Film exec. He never watches/listens to/goes to anything he reviews, and just tosses a coin to determine whether to call it “provocative” or “lacking a unique aesthetic.”

Author Francine Prose once talked about imagining her favorite writers as her personal cloud of witnesses, looking over her shoulder as she crafts her National Book Award-nominated sentences and moves around her critically acclaimed commas. I always loved this idea. It seemed like a nice thing to have Leo Tolstoy tell you whether your prose was purple or an appropriately restrained shade of lavender, or to have Virgil call you on your incorrect and anyway probably pretentious use of the term chiasmus. And then this one time in Lamont, as I was working on my eighth coffee of a total 11 consumed that night and my second page of a total 25 due the next morning, there they all were! All the writers I most admire and whose opinions I most respect! We had a great conversation until I was kicked out of the reading room for talking to myself.
Emily Dickinson: I like a look of agony, but does your eyebrow always twitch like that? And between us, you have a piece of Triscuit in your hair. Darling, you might want to find a dimmer slant of light to sit in.
André Breton: [reading my essay] I like this. The meaningless spewing forth of the inchoate unconscious, eh?
Me: Um. No. An analysis of the politics of gender in the fiction of D.H. Lawrence, actually.
D.H. Lawrence: [also reading essay] [faints in horror]
Me: Hm. Well, just leave him there, I guess.
Charles Dickens: [reads essay, then takes off spectacles and rubs eyes in a defeated sort of way]
Ernest Hemingway: [offers Dickens bottle of gin]
Charles Dickens: [takes bottle of gin] I spoke too soon about the worst of times. I mean, how bad is the guillotine, really? It would all have been over in a second, and it took me at least 53 seconds to make it through that essay. You’ve misspelled “Misogyny” in your title, by the way.
Me: Oh. Thanks.
Robert Frost: [looking at essay] Hard to say what it’s about, but visually it’s quite striking. It makes me think of a slim birch tree, or a narrow path through a snow-covered wood. Any particular reason the margins are so wide?
Jane Austen: Normally I would try not to prejudge things before I’ve really given them a chance, but the fact that you’ve typed this in Comic Sans makes it rather difficult. Is it supposed to make your essay, like, “fun” or something?
Homer: Could you explain the phrase “post-structural proto-Marxist anti-imperialist femininity”? Is that some kind of lingo that the kids are using these days?
Henry David Thoreau: [weighs essay in hand] I wonder how many trees died for this. Christ. I’m going back to Walden.

Harvard affiliates and residents from across the Boston area are organizing efforts to protest top Donald Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon’s visit to the Institute of Politics this week.
Bannon’s name appeared on a list of confirmed attendees for the IOP event, called “Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 2016,” to be held at the Kennedy School of Government Wednesday and Thursday. The event will feature election journalists and political strategists from both the Hillary Clinton and Trump campaigns.
Bannon was the CEO of president-elect Trump’s campaign, and Trump appointed Bannon to be his chief strategist once he assumes office in January. Bannon previously headed Breitbart News, a controversial right-wing media outlet.
Boston activists and Harvard students condemned Bannon and began organizing on social media to protest his visit after The Crimson reported Monday that he will attend the IOP event this week.
More than 700 people have indicated on a Facebook page called “Protest Stephen Bannon & Trump Advisors at Harvard” that they plan to attend a protest at the Kennedy School on Wednesday.
“We do not accept hate and bigotry as normal or legitimate. Come preacefully [sic] protest. Then help us organize,” the Faebook event description reads.
Bannon graduated from the Harvard Business School in 1985. His appointment has draw criticism from hundreds of HBS alumni and the Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Meanwhile,  Harvard students are circulating an open letter to University President Drew G. Faust asking Faust to condemn Bannon’s appointment to Trump’s administration. According to the letter’s authors, more than 3,300 people have signed the letter.
“We are certain you know that Harvard’s name has been used to justify Mr. Bannon's appointment despite criticism of his hateful words and deeds,” the authors wrote in the letter.
The final event of the this week’s program is a public panel titled “War Stories: Inside Campaign 2016,” and will bring together Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.

(Camera opens on Trevor’s bed. There lies a giant man-bun, with two little legs sporting white Converse. Cue “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves. Man-bun springs out of bed, begins brushing face, arms, chest, and back. Man-bun then brushes teeth—they’re incredibly white, for a man-bun’s. Turns to camera.)
MAN-BUN: Hi! I’m Trevor, also known as Man-Bun Levin. You know what I hate? Fascism! Also conditioner—that stuff’s the worst. Did you know I’m from Cleveland? Spoiler alert: I am!
(Man-Bun Levin starts strutting out of his spacious Mather single. Waves good-bye to his suitemates. They do not wave back. One, craven-eyed and twitching, menacingly waves a pair of clippers. Man-Bun laughs, blows him a kiss. Cue Kanye West’s “Gold Digger.”)
MAN-BUN: These flowing locks are a blessing and a curse. A blessing because when I whip my head back and forth, my hair spins like two helicopter blades, and I can float to class. A curse because sometimes small children accost me and use my locks as a jump rope. They also call me “Hairy Potter” and “Prince Hairy” and “Hairy Connick Jr.” They also play tug-of-war with my head; whoever wins, I lose. It was never like this in Cleveland, though. I’m from Cleveland.
(Man-Bun Levin arrives at Social Studies 10. Goes on 30-minute rant about Tocqueville, economic inequality, and quality Spotify playlists. He finishes, turns to his peers for opposing opinions. They do not respond, since they are tangled in his hirsute body. Cue “The Scientist” by Coldplay.)
MAN-BUN: But… really. Did you not know I was from Cleveland? Ha! That’s crazy. Because I am! I am, guys. It’s in my blood. No, really—my heart is shaped like Ohio. It’s a serious issue. (Sighs) I guess what I’m trying to say is… Donald Trump. Is. The. Worst.
(Man-Bun Levin engorges a pile of septuple-stuffed Oreos. Begins crafting pitch email. Sun sets, begins to rise again. Man-Bun Levin is still crafting pitch email—it is 20 pages long. Cue “High and Dry” by Radiohead.)
MAN-BUN: Here’s the truth. Beneath this mountain of hair, I’m just a fleshy, sentient man. And beneath this flesh, I’m just a smaller, fleshier mountain of hair, with a perfect GPA and a passion for Europe. Not the continent—the band. I’m from Cleveland, guys.
(Camera lingers on Man-Bun Levin’s face-hair. Pans out—he’s in Progressive Field, immersed in a sea of a thousand Hillary Clintons, singing the entire Beatles discography in three-part harmony. Camera cuts back to Man-Bun. He turns, winks at camera. Credits roll.)
