After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Carousel,” which ran from March 12 to 13 in the Oberon, was an immersive theater experience that immediately pulled the audience into the world of Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan—a world of carnival games that effortlessly caught the eye with its flurries of bright colors, lights, candies, and bar drinks served before the play even started by the very same cast members that would grace the stage later that evening. This pre-show interlude was completed by similarly enchanting music by an impressive band led by Andrew R. Chow ’14, an active Crimson editor.
 
Such a scene set the stage for “Carousel,” the story of the tumultuous romance between carousel barker Billy Bigelow (Jacob A. Brandt ’14) and millworker Julie Jordan (Elizabeth K. Leimkuhler ’15)—a romance that lasts through thick and thin despite the character flaws of both parties involved. With solid technical elements and an excellent cast that sometimes struggled to create a sense of unity amongst themselves, the production, directed by Susanna B. Wolk ’14, successfully navigated the musical’s light surface and dark undertones.
 
These undertones were conveyed through effective usage of props, set design, and lighting.The lighting aptly conveyed night and day, spotlighting dramatic moments like Julie’s pregnancy announcement and Billy’s entry to heaven. Wolk even cleverly used the Oberon bar to create a picturesque tableau that displayed the cast as some sat on bar seats and others on the actual table in “Blow High, Blow Low,” showcasing the actors together in an innovative way. Moreover, stylistic choices like the masked ensemble members and props such as the hordes of jeering cardboard eyes in Louisa’s (Maya M. Park ’16)—Billy and Julie’s daughter—debut scene were effective in reinforcing her feelings of being an outcast since birth.
 
Each of the show’s leads carried out well-executed performances, particularly Leimkuhler and Brandt. Leimkuhler’s classically strong and elegant singing style gave her role a distinctive character that was highly reminiscent of Jan Clayton in the original Broadway cast. Similarly, Brandt’s powerful mixed register coupled with his fantastic resonance made for a great musical performance. Both actors’ vocals worked especially well together in “If I Loved You,” their central duet, creating a musical rapport that was effective in conveying the sentimentality of the song.
 
On the whole, each of the actors performed extremely well individually from the standpoints of both music and character development. In “You’re a Queer One, Julie Jordan,” Kyra A. Atekwana ’14 showcased her fabulous tone and powerful upper register as Carrie Pipperidge. Kyle R. Whelihan’s ’17 phenomenal range and charmingly innocent portrayal of Enoch Snow were a joy to experience as he dramatically entered behind the audience to make his debut in “When I Marry Mister Snow.” In the song “You’ll Never Walk Alone,” the mood is particularly heartbreaking as Leimkuhler’s character immediately breaks down just after whispering to Brandt “I love you.” It was one of the most powerfully delivered lines of the entire production. 
 
Park, however, particularly stood out in the cast. Her skills as a dancer complemented the role in the best possible ways. While her character was given a relatively small amount of time onstage, Park certainly left an impression with graceful movements that flawlessly matched the youthful, spritely tone of the music in the miniature ballet at the beginning of the second act.
 
Given all of this, the chemistry between the actors was lacking in parts. Atekwana and Whelihan’s onstage relationship, while at times sweet and heartwarming, was contrived and artificial in other crucial scenes. When Carrie’s supposed infidelity is made apparent, Whelihan’s anger fell flat and lacked the nuance of a genuinely upset, betrayed spouse. Similarly, Atekwana’s reaction to the advances of Jigger (Brad A. Latilla-Campbell ’16) seemed less than truly distraught and defensive. Moreover, at times, leads Brandt and Leimkuhler suffered from strained chemistry most notably during Brandt’s death scene. The musicality of the two actors, though, made up for these drawbacks.
 With an extremely strong cast—at least as individuals—and an effective use of set, props, and lighting, Wolk’s production has proven to be a ride on a carousel that will be thoroughly remembered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after the commencement of U.S. Senate hearings to confirm U.S. Surgeon General nominee Vivek H. Murthy ’98, a Harvard Medical School instructor, the White House is “recalibrating” its efforts to appoint the physician in response to strong opposition by the National Rifle Association and Congressional conservatives, according to White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.
In a letter to the Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, the NRA’s chief lobbyist, Chris W. Cox, condemned Murthy’s record of support for increased gun control measures, including firearms restrictions, gun “buyback” programs, and the removal of restrictions on anti-gun advocacy research by the Centers for Disease Control, claiming that the physician’s “political [and] ideological motives” could impede his ability to serve as Surgeon General.
In 2008, Murthy, who now works as a physician at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, founded  “Doctors for Obama,” which was later renamed “Doctors for America,” an organization aiming to support President Obama in broadening health care access.
Now, Murthy faces criticism by Republicans and as many as 10 conservative Democrats, according to several Senate aides, suggesting that he will face a decidedly uphill battle in receiving the Senate approval necessary for appointment to the position.
In the letter, Cox said that Murthy’s stance on gun control, which the physician has called an issue of public health, would taint his ability to act only on empirical evidence and to examine health issues relevant to firearm owners.
 
“Dr. Murthy’s record of political activism in support of radical gun control measures raises significant concerns about...the likelihood he would use the office of Surgeon General to further his pre-existing campaign against gun ownership,” Cox said.
 
When asked last week if the White House would abandon support for Murthy’s confirmation, Carney told reporters that the Executive Office was re-evaluating its approach, although it remained optimistic about the appointment.
“We expect him to get confirmed ultimately and be one of the country’s most powerful messengers on health and wellness,” Carney said.
According to Arthur L. Caplan, head of the Division of Bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center and advocate for the treatment of gun violence as a public health issue, the opposition is a politicized attempt to distance gun violence from discussions of public health.
“The effort to block him by the NRA is absurd on its face, has no merit, is utterly politics, and is inimical to the health of all Americans,” Caplan said in an interview. “It’s ridiculous. It’s absurd. It shouldn’t even be a subject of debate as to whether gun safety and gun violence are public health issues.”
Theodore Ruger, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on constitutional and health law, stressed that the Surgeon General is but an advisor to the President—and thus does not directly implement the Executive Branch’s legislative agenda.
Recalling the decades-long latency period before legal action was taken after the Surgeon General’s first reports linking smoking and health issues in the 1960s, Ruger said that, in the case of Murthy, there would be a disconnect between his political views and actual gun control legislation.
“This makes the opposition look much more like a political statement than any serious concern that an Surgeon General is going to restrict gun rights,” Ruger said.
 
Still, according to Caplan, the role entails significant influence over the lifestyle and behavioral decisions of the American public, while working within the limits of information validated by scientific research and scholarship.
 
“The office, in a strange way, is nothing more than a bully pulpit. It’s a very loud megaphone,” said Caplan. “You don’t make laws. What you’re trying to do is to get people to be healthier by being a conduit to the latest research and wisdom about what you can do to be healthy.”
 
Contrary to what one might expect, said Ruger, opposition to gun control has grown in recent years, despite the 2008 landmark case District of Columbia v. Heller, in which the Supreme Court upheld an individual’s right to possess a firearm, at least in federal enclaves such as the District of Columbia.
 
“What seems to have happened is that the voices against gun control have gotten even more extreme since Heller, and more aggressive since Sandy Hook, and opposing even very moderate gun control legislation that would have been widely agreed to a decade ago,” he said. “We can clearly say that it is politically and constitutionally more difficult than it has ever been to regulate guns in the United States.”
 
According to Caplan, however, the fierce opposition to gun control does not necessarily reflect the views of the broader American population.
 
“I think that the position of the NRA still remains ‘we can’t give an inch or the law will break and we will not be able to stop a cascade of restrictions on gun ownership and sales,’” he said. “But I think the opposite is true: Americans are very positive about guns, but they want to see them used safely and responsibly.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Spring break is on the horizon, meaning that the winter sports season is coming to a close. Several Harvard teams are deep in postseason play, including the men’s and women's basketball teams, who are in the second rounds of the NCAA Tournament and the WNIT, respectively. Additionally, the Crimson will be sending a handful of individuals into postseason competitions, including sophomore wrestler Todd Preston, junior diver Mike Mosca, and 11 fencers.
Nonetheless, even amidst the commotion surrounding the playoffs, Harvard athletes have still found the time to take to Twitter. Here at The Back Page, we have compiled some of our favorites from the past week. Enjoy!
7. With the tournament just a week away, junior men’s basketball player Jonah Travis is trying to stay motivated everywhere he goes.
“Meek mills ooh kill em probably wasn't the best to listen to before class... I'm in here about to start a fight for no reason.”
Whatever it takes, Jonah.
6. Next on the countdown is sophomore men’s squash player Nick Hopcroft, who asks the question that has been on the minds of Pixar fans for years.
“What ever happened to Incredibles 2?”
Any opportunity to get Samuel L. Jackson into a Disney movie is one that needs to be seized.
5. John Rose, a senior on the men’s lacrosse team, has finally come to a realization after analyzing his fellow classmates closely over the last four years.
“Harvard people are too smart. most of them can read five books at the same time but i can barely finish the one I'm coloring ‪#godhelpme.”
To be fair, coloring is an art.
4. Needless to say, freshman swimmer Sava Turcanu was not happy about her commute Tuesday afternoon.
“Had to walk an extra mile to my dorm because the President's on campus. ‪#ThanksObama.”
The President once said, “If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.” He may or may not have followed that up with a #sorrynotsorry.
3. As mentioned before, Todd Preston is heading to the NCAA Championships, and freshman wrestler Zach Dinan could not be any happier.
“Todd I literally just screamed my head off in lamont and everyone started staring at me. CONGRATS BUD!!!! ‪@tpreston16 ‪@HarvardWrestlin.”
Totally worth it.
2. The men’s basketball team has gotten plenty of national attention over the past week, and freshman guard Matt Fraschilla is certainly enjoying the spotlight.
“On sportscenter hitting the Nae Nae after Steve's dunk ‪#crossthatoffthelist.”
He’s been taking lessons from Jonah. #ohhkillem
1. The Crimson men’s basketball team officially became the first team in the country to secure a spot in the Big Dance Friday Night, and the madness has begun to spread. So earning the top spot on our countdown is none other than the man, the myth, the legend—Jeremy Lin.
“Yessirrrrr ‪@hoopsatharvard ... were goin dancing!!! ‪#nerdscanhooptoo.”

When the start of the NFL season rolls around this September, Harvard alum Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 will once again take a crack at winning the AFC South division title. However, this time around, he will be suiting up for a new team.
The former Tennessee quarterback agreed to a two-year deal with the Houston Texans Thursday. According to the Houston Chronicle, the deal will be worth $7.5 million.
Fitzpatrick appeared in 11 games for the Titans last season and recorded a 3-6 record in his nine starts. All six losses came against teams with winning records, but the quarterback kept them close, as five out of the six contests were decided by fewer than 10 points.
After beginning the season as a backup, Fitzpatrick was launched into the permanent starting role when franchise quarterback Jake Locker went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Despite his poor record under center, Fitzpatrick actually posted one of the best stat-lines of his career.
Fitzpatrick finished the year with 2,454 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He matched his career best in completion percentage (62.0) and recorded his second best passer rating (82.0), falling just short of the 83.3 mark he reached in 2012.
In his first year at the helm, Texans’ coach and fellow Ivy League grad Bill O’Brien addressed one of his team’s biggest needs with the signing of Fitzpatrick. Houston quarterbacks combined to throw just 19 touchdowns against 22 interceptions last year. Furthermore, Matt Schaub, who began the season as the Texans’ starter, has lost the support of the fans and could be on his way out.
Consequently, Fitzpatrick will likely be competing for the starting job right off the bat in training camp. Barring any offseason moves by the Houston front office, he will be up against Case Keenum, T.J. Yates, and possibly Schaub. Houston also holds the first overall pick in May’s NFL Draft, so the depth chart could be even more crowded by the start of the preseason.
Since entering the league in 2005, Fitzpatrick has thrown for 16,790 yards and 106 touchdowns. He spent two years with the Rams, two years with the Bengals, and four years with the Bills before heading to Tennessee.

One of the most remarkable facets of the Crimson’s win over Cincinnati is that Harvard did not play like an underdog. The Bearcats was the favorite but was not beaten by a typical underdog pulling in offensive boards, creating turnovers and draining an abnormally high number of threes. Cincinnati was simply outplayed over the course of 40 minutes despite being the clearly more athletic team. This begs the very simple question: can Amaker’s boys do it again on Saturday against Michigan State?
Fortunately March is when the sports stats community comes out of hibernation in the name of ‘bracketology’, with multiple predictions trying to put a number on the Crimson’s chances.
ESPN's Giantkillers blog gives the Crimson at a lowly 24.0 percent of pulling out the upset, but acknowledge that they believe that to be a “lowball estimate”. ESPN points to Harvard playing actually a fairly average game in the second round with an uncharacteristic 12 turnovers and only nine offensive rebounds as evidence that the Spartans need to watch out as the Crimson can step up their game.
According to kenpom.com, Harvard has shot an excellent 38.8 percent from beyond the arc, good for 26th in Division-I, but only 28.5 percent of its field goals are three point attempts, in the bottom quintile nationwide. On Thursday, the Crimson upped its three point rate to 38.6 percent—reminiscent of its 42.8 percent rate last year against New Mexico—and will likely do so again against the Spartans. 
Underdogs benefit from high variance tactics, and there is no higher variance shot than the trey. The Spartans rank a barely-above-average 112th in the country at allowing three pointers to drop. If Rivard and Curry can get going as they did in the first half against Cincinnati, Michigan State will be in danger.
Ken Pomeroy, a meteorologist and leader in tempo-adjusted college basketball analytics, uses the entire season of data to put a Pythagorean winning percentage on each college hoops team. Using the Pythagorean numbers from two opponents, we can estimate the probability of each team winning using Bill James’ log5 formula. Using this method, Harvard comes out a lot better with a 36.0% chance of getting to the Sweet Sixteen. However, Ken Pomeroy himself acknowledges that “there are subjective factors which this analysis does not include” when predicting Tournament games. 
Nate Silver, of predicting elections fame, uses kenpom’s rankings along with a whole host of other predictive metrics in his analysis. A fuller explanation of his method is here but there are two key reasons why he is not as high the Crimson, giving them only a 23% chance to beat Michigan State. Firstly, he incorporates the preseason rankings which had the Spartans narrowly as second only to Kentucky, which he argues represents an estimation of the true talent on their roster independent of the relatively short 35-game season. Secondly, he utilizes Sonny Moore's ratings, which emphasize recent performance very heavily. Since Michigan State is one of the hottest teams in the country right now, with 22.3 percent of ESPN users picking them to make the Final Four—the most popular team from the East—it scores very highly via this metric. 
Finally, if you want a model which likes Harvard, look no further than a recent Harvard graduate. John L. Ezekowitz ’13 produces a bracket annually based on survival analysis. His bracket analysis also makes unique use of mapping the network of Tourney teams based on regular season interactions, and then integrates network properties of each team into his estimations. John’s predictions have the Crimson winning 38 percent of the time.
Of course, outside of the statosphere is the betting line, which reflects public opinion on the game. As of press time Harvard is a +274 underdog, which translates to an expected winning percentage of 26.7 percent.
So while everyone disagrees on how much of a chance the Crimson have on winning tomorrow, everyone agrees it has a chance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—On Saturday night (8:40 EST, TNT), the Harvard men’s basketball team will take on the Michigan State Spartans in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. In part I of a two-part preview, staff writer David Freed looks at Michigan State’s tournament profile and whether its style of play increases the likelihood of a Harvard upset.
Quick Primer on Michigan State:
Record: 27-8 (12-6 Big Ten)
Best Wins: Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa (twice), Oklahoma
Worst Losses: Georgetown, Nebraska, Illinois
RPI: 17
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 10
Star Players: Gary Harris (So. Guard), 16.9 ppg, 2.6 apg; Adreian Payne (Sr. Forward) 16.7 ppg, 7.4 rpg
Common Opponents:
The Spartans and the Crimson have just one opponent in common—the Columbia Lions. Harvard swept the Lions, winning in double overtime in New York and then pounding them by 33 at Lavietes Pavilion. The Spartans beat Columbia at home, 62-53, in a nailbiter that caused Spartan coach Tom Izzo to say afterwards: “We proved tonight we’re not ready to handle any kind of success, and that disappoints me.” Columbia led by four at the half and trailed by just two with two minutes to go, at which point it committed back-to-back shot clock violations, and Michigan State scored the final eight points.
Style of Play:
Michigan State plays in the mold of its coach as a tough defensive team with a host of rugged post defenders that clean up the defensive glass. After the Columbia win, Izzo noted that “rebounding here is a religion,” and Payne and junior forward Branden Dawson, who combine for nearly 15 boards per game, live by that mantra.
The Spartans do not play at a particularly fast pace, ranking just 208th in the country in adjusted-tempo. Michigan State is a patient and extremely effective offensive team that employs a balanced inside-out attack to pummel opponents. Four Spartan starters shoot 35 percent or better from deep, and Izzo often uses tough screeners Payne and Dawson to generate open looks for Harris and senior guard Keith Appling (37 percent from deep).
Because Payne, a 44 percent three-point shooter himself, has a devastating pick-and-pop game, opponents cannot switch off the screener. Payne’s diverse game is a nightmare mismatch for opponents and forces opposing forwards away from the paint, which opens up driving lanes for slashers Harris and Appling. This also gives Dawson, an extremely effective post player who shoots 60.6 percent from the floor, ample room to operate in the interior. Add this all up and you get a devastating offensive attack that ranks 10th in the country in offensive efficiency.
Upset Potential:
Last week, I ranked eight possible Crimson first-round opponents in five categories—three-point shooting frequency, three-point shooting frequency allowed, defensive rebounding percentage, offensive rebounding percentage, and opponent turnover percentage—to judge Harvard’s chances of an upset. Here is where Michigan State fits in, with its national rank (out of 351) in parentheses:
OREB%: 32.7% (83)
DREB%: 76.0% (9)
Op. TO%: 17.6% (193) 
3P Freq.: 35.8% (92)
Op. 3P Freq.: 37.0% (307)
Unlike most Izzo teams, the Spartans do not profile as an extremely safe “Giant” by most of these metrics. Although Michigan State has been touted as a title-favorite—picked by both Obama and Vegas to win it all—the squad does not do the things most safe favorites do. Because the Spartans rank as only slightly above average on the offensive glass and rarely force turnovers, they do not maximize possessions to allow talent disparity to come through.
Beyond that, the Spartans are one of the 50 worst teams in the country in letting opponents get free from behind the arc. In its first matchup against Delaware, the Hens got loose for 20 three-point attempts, knocking down eight as they hung around late into the second half, despite getting slaughtered on the boards, 42-24. Good three-point shooting by Payne and junior Travis Trice (7-of-9 combined from long range) kept Delaware at bay, but the Hens, who turned it over eight times, provided the blueprint that Harvard needs to follow on Saturday.
Ultimately, the numbers aren’t too kind to Michigan State because of the injuries it has suffered this year. When healthy, the Spartans ran off 18 of 19 to start the season, and romped through the Big Ten Tournament, living up to the expectations that made them the preseason second-ranked team in the nation. Harvard is well positioned to attack Michigan State with its ability to take care of the ball and let the ball loose from deep, but the talent disparity here is far larger than against Cincinnati.
Crimson fans can take solace in the fact that Harvard certainly did not play its best against the Bearcats and that Harvard matches up well with the Spartans. With the exception of Payne, Michigan State is not an especially large team (Dawson is the next biggest starter at 6’6”) and Harvard’s defense actually ranks better than that of the Spartans. Michigan State can get out and run, but the pace won’t be anything like what the Bearcats threw at Harvard. The talent difference is vast, however, but Harvard will be in this game if it knocks down the open looks it will get from three and holds Payne and Harris relatively at bay. But, if those two get going early, this contest could evoke memories of last year’s evisceration at the hands of Arizona.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SPOKANE, Wash.—More than two decades ago, then-Duke assistant coach Tommy Amaker and then-Michigan State assistant coach Tom Izzo ran into each other in the hallway of their hotel. And in a rickety, old high school gym. And in various other interchangeable places on the road—the restaurants, gyms, and highways that are familiar to those involved in the recruiting scene.
 
The two young coaches were coming from different backgrounds and different universities but were both going after the same high school player: Chris Webber.
 
Webber was in the midst of a celebrated career at Detroit Country Day School, during which time he guided his team to three state titles. By his fourth year, he was averaging almost 30 points per contest. The forward was highly sought-after, and was just the type of player that major programs like Duke and Michigan State aimed to seduce.
 
Enter Amaker and Izzo, who, according to Izzo, “spen[t] an enormous [amount of] time on the road together,” traveling down to Florida to watch Webber compete in AAU Tournaments.
 
“You end up getting to know each other [while recruiting],” said now-Harvard coach Amaker at Friday’s NCAA Tournament media availability. “You don’t get a better guy [than Izzo]…. [Those trips] started our friendship and relationship, and it’s never wavered.”
 
Flash forward about a decade, and the two were still going head-to-head from the sidelines of the hardwood. But instead of competing for high school players at AAU gyms, Amaker and Izzo were now the head coaches of the University of Michigan and Michigan State, respectively—two schools considered rivals in just about every athletic category.
 
While Amaker and Izzo had been on the same page when recruiting Webber, their two programs were on anything but equal levels. Izzo and his Spartans had just taken home the 2000 national championship, while Amaker inherited a Wolverines team that was facing the repercussions of several NCAA violations—some of which, incidentally, were incurred during Webber’s career at Michigan, his eventual collegiate home.
 
“He came in at a tough time,”  Izzo said on Friday. “He gets the job and…all  those sanctions come out. And he was behind the eight ball before he even got started. Michigan’s a good school, and I think under normal circumstances, he could have had a lot of success.”
 
Amaker remained at Michigan for six seasons, during which time he amassed a .567 winning percentage, notching the 2004 National Invitation Tournament title and losing in the finals of that same tournament in 2006. His efforts were not enough, however, and he was let go after the 2006-07 season.
 
“Amaker had to weather some things that, when you look at schools that have been under serious probation, the next coach in there, that’s a tough, tough job,” Izzo said. “But I think he was respected by people…. I [was] his number one nemesis at the time, [his] rival, and I always had great respect and admiration for the guy.”
 
A little less than 12 years and two months after the two “nemeses” first competed against one another as head coaches, Amaker and Izzo will once again face off. This time, it’ll be in Spokane, Wash., as their two teams vie for a bid to the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet Sixteen.
 
And just 30 hours before the coaches match up once more, Amaker took a moment out of his press conference to remember how it was this “rival” that offered him support upon his dismissal from Michigan. Izzo, Amaker said, was the first opposing coach outside of his “immediate family” to phone him after news of the firing broke.
 
“We go back a long way,” Amaker said. “He’s a terrific basketball coach, [and] he’s even a better person…. Tom has been a true friend through the years, and I’ve respected him…. I think he’s an ambassador for the institution, for the state of Michigan, and certainly for the game of basketball.”
 
After Amaker left the podium on Friday, it was Izzo’s turn to take the microphone. While Amaker reflected on their common history, Izzo turned to the present—to Amaker’s current seven-year tenure with the Crimson.
 
“Knowing Tommy like I do…Harvard’s been just kind of a great situation for him,” Izzo said. “Where he’s taken that place is unbelievable to me. They’re a good, solid basketball team. Tommy is a good, solid human being and a great coach. So, consequently, nothing surprises me about [the Crimson’s success]. I think Harvard is lucky to have him.”
 
In less than twenty-four hours, the former rivals will once more share a common gym. While they may no longer be watching an AAU Tournament, and while they are certainly no longer in Michigan, their joint journey to and in the big leagues of college basketball has not been forgotten.
 
“I think the world of him and I just—I wish we wouldn’t have to have this game,” Amaker said. “But certainly it’s here, and I do think that [Izzo] is as good as they come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Let’s be clear, Saturday isn’t just a big day for Harvard; it’s a big day for the Ivy League.
The Crimson will take center stage for the conference tonight when it takes on Michigan State with a Sweet Sixteen berth on the line. A win would mark the sixth consecutive year that Harvard has improved its postseason performance and the second time in five years that the Ivy League has made the Sweet Sixteen.
Hidden in that stat is the rub: this conference isn’t sneaking up on anybody anymore.
For the first time in its history, the Ivy League sent five teams to postseason play this year. Harvard, as the conference champion, headed to the Big Dance, but Princeton (CBI) and Columbia, Brown, and Yale (CIT) all punched their own tournament tickets. Four teams—all but Brown—advanced. Three will play games today, with Yale having a chance to avenge the league’s only loss tonight against Holy Cross.
“You can always argue about some teams being better in the past, but in terms of top to bottom, it’s as good as ever,” Yale coach James Jones said.
The numbers back him up. This year’s Crimson does not profile as the league’s best champion, but for the first time in 10 years, the Ancient Eight has four teams in the top 150 of the RPI. Since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the Ivy League has never had the run of postseason success it is having now. The conference has split its last eight Tournament contests, with only a Brandon Knight floater standing between it and a winning record.
The players certainly don’t fear the big conference schools anymore. In its two NCAA tournament wins, Harvard has led nearly tip-to-buzzer, trailing for less than seven minutes combined. Its next opponent, Michigan State, trailed Columbia for 20 consecutive minutes in November before back-to-back shot clock violations keyed a late 8-0 Spartan run.
“Anything can happen in these 40 minutes,” said Crimson co-captain Brandyn Curry on Wednesday. “These upsets are happening more and more often. I think it’s because the talent around America is just getting better, and these players are going to decide to be different.”
I’m not a subscriber to the belief that the pressures on Kentucky and Kansas to recruit one-and-done freshmen have leveled the playing field—after all, the biggest stars on some of the nation’s recent Cinderellas have been young. Sophomore Gordon Hayward led Butler to the championship game in 2010, and last year’s Final Four darling Wichita State used three underclassmen (Fred VanVleet, Ron Baker, and Tekele Cotton) in its backcourt.
The Ivy League has emerged because the conference has shown an ability to recruit talent in spades. The stories have all been written about Harvard’s recruiting prowess, but both Yale and Penn have three-star recruits playing for them. Princeton came extremely close to having two consecutive Ivy League Players of the Year; Cornell is just four years removed from a 29-win team.
“I don’t think people understand really how hard it is to go and play back-to-back nights against these teams,” Curry said.
The 14-game regular season, with each team playing a home-and-away series against every other, ensures coaches and players are extremely familiar with one another. Often called “the 14-game tournament” by Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, the grueling road back-to-backs of the regular season—with players on the bus just two hours after a game and on the floor a day later—prepare teams well for the turnaround part of the NCAA Tournament.
Mastering this quick turnaround is essential to winning the league. Much has been made about Michigan State coach Tom Izzo’s 18-3 record in tournament turnaround (Saturday/Sunday) games, but Amaker himself is 13-5 on Saturdays over the three-year Tournament run.
“You got to take each weekend by itself because it’s a mini-tournament within itself,” Curry said. “The Ivy League is just going to continue to get better.”
“I just hope it gets more credit,” he continued.
Three wins Saturday, and it certainly will.

If you weren’t in the Boston for St. Paddy’s Day, you missed out—that is, if you weren’t in South Boston for its annual parade the day before St. Patrick’s Day.
 I was lucky enough to make it to Irish Pride central last Sunday for the parade, so if you couldn’t make it to Southie, here’s a little play-by-play of what you missed.
Drunk people
Lots and lots of them. It is a parade celebrating the Irish after all, what else is expected
Alcohol
Along with the thousands of drunk college students (and native Southies) roaming around Broadway Street were the many six-packs of Bud Light that followed. A walk through the Broadway Red Line T stop saw many a crushed PBR or Budweiser.
Boston cops
Where there are drunk college kids, there are cops. And the St. Paddy’s Day Parade was surely no exception. I don’t think I’ve ever seen more cops patrolling a Burger King parking lot than I did at the Burger King on Broadway and D Street. I saw more cops giving out tickets to college kids with open bottles than I see them giving out parking tickets in Harvard Square.
No Mayor Walsh
Big in the news was Mayor Walsh’s announcement that he would not be attending the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Walsh, in a press release a week before the Parade, stated that he would be boycotting the Parade over anti-gay discrimination.
Green
I’ll leave the interpretation up to you, but whether you’re thinking about the color that represents Irish Pride, or the plant with a distinct smell, there was a lot of green represented in Southie.

For seniors who have been slow on the uptake, it’s probably time to get a job. The cash flow from your bank account has slowed to a trickle and the care packages from your parents are no more. Luckily, to supplement your lavish Harvard lifestyle of sushi in Lamont and midnight Tasty Burger, there’s a perfect job opening for you. 
Pretty much the dream, this job asks for a “Wikipedian-in-Residence” to edit and add articles to the people’s encyclopedia. That’s right, you’d get paid for editing Wikipedia, which probably more than a few nerds do here already. 
Paying $16 per hour and centered in Houghton Library, the rare books library, this is one of the sweeter gigs on campus. Basically the applicant will “expand coverage on Wikipedia of topics relevant to Houghton collections.” This includes adding sources and creating new pages—child’s play for anyone who has ever participated in a Wikirace. 
While the title “Wikipedian-in-Residence” might sound like make-believe, it is very real, with many companies and institutions, such as the Smithsonian, the British Library and the Palace of Versailles, opting to hire one to upload more content for everyone to browse freely. This is perfect for any seniors who forgot that the real world and resumes exist. Bulk up!

On campus and looking for something to do in the last days of spring break? Want to be an aspiring photographer or looking for a great way to get acquainted with the Hub? Boston is a beautiful city, with more than three centuries of architecture and a spectacular natural setting. Here are some of the best views of the city:
Airplane
This view is easily the most dramatic of Boston, but also requires the greatest degree of luck, because there are multiple runways and approaches that pilots can take flying into Logan Airport, and you have to be sitting on the correct side of the plane to get a view (which side of the plane that is depends on the approach). Still, if you are lucky enough to be on the correct side of the plane, you can get what is arguably the best view of Boston.
Boston Common1311 Tremont Street, Boston
The United States’s oldest park and the start of the Boston Freedom Trail, Boston Common is situated in the heart of Boston, nestled between some of Beantown’s most famous neighborhoods - Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Chinatown, and Downtown Crossing. This large, grassy expanse offers a great place to go for a walk, play frisbee, or just read in this oasis of tranquility. It also offers great views of the Boston skyline and the Massachusetts State House, which is located just across Beacon Street.
Nearest T stop: Park Street (Red Line)
Charles River Esplanade47 David G Mugar Way, Boston
Located along the banks of the Charles River in the Back Bay and West End neighborhoods of Boston, the Charles River Esplanade is a wonderful park to go jogging and to take in views of the Back Bay skyline (Back Bay is home to Boston’s two tallest buildings - the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center). It is also home to the Hatch Memorial Shell, which is an outdoor concert venue. The best spot to get a skyline view is just south of the Longfellow Bridge, while the part north of the Longfellow Bridge offers great views of Kendall Square and the bridge itself.
Nearest T stops: Charles/MGH, Park Street (Red Line)
Memorial Drive575 Memorial Dr, Cambridge
Memorial Drive parallels the Charles River throughout most of Cambridge, but the best spots to get a classic view of the Boston skyline are located on and around the campus of MIT. The area in front of the Hyatt Regency Cambridge offers a view of Back Bay, Beacon Hill, Downtown, as well as the Citgo sign in Kenmore Square and the Harvard Bridge (which is ironically on MIT’s campus). Travelling further east, the views continue as far east as the Museum of Science. The Charles River Path, which follows Memorial Drive, is also a great place to go for a run, jog, or walk. Crossing the Harvard Bridge (which carries Massachusetts Avenue across the Charles River) also offers a unique perspective of both the Boston and Cambridge skylines along with the iconic Zakim Bridge.
Nearest T stops: Kendall/MIT (Red Line)
Piers Park95 Marginal St, Boston
Located in East Boston just north of Logan Airport, Piers Park is a wonderful place to get a view of Boston Harbor and the Downtown Boston skyline. This angle looks very different than the skyline of Back Bay, as city’s skyline appears to be much more dense from this angle.
Nearest T Stop: Maverick (Blue Line)
 Robbins Farm Park61 Eastern Ave, Arlington 02476
 
Perched atop a hill in Arlington (located just northwest of Cambridge), Robbins Farm Park offers an expansive view of the entire Boston skyline, including Back Bay, Downtown, the Zakim Bridge, and the Bunker Hill Monument. You can also see a few Harvard buildings in the foreground when looking from this park. It is located in a quiet, residential neighborhood, near a school and a subdivision, and also has a children’s playground.
Nearest T Stop: Alewife (Red Line), from which you need to take a bus; however, the fastest way to get there is to take the 77 Bus to Massachusetts Ave. & Prentiss Rd.
 Skywalk Observatory800 Boylston St, Boston
Located on the 50th floor of the Prudential Center (Boston’s second-tallest building), the Skywalk Observatory offers a 360-degree view of Boston as well as neighboring cities such as Cambridge. The Skywalk also has exhibits related to the history and culture of Boston, making it a great place to get acquainted with the city. Two floors above the Skywalk is an expensive restaurant called “Top of the Hub”, but much less expensive food options abound at The Shops at the Prudential Center (which is also one of Boston’s largest shopping centers) and in the surrounding Back Bay neighborhood.
Nearest T Stops: Prudential (Green Line)
South Boston Waterfront/Seaport District1 Seaport Lane, Boston
Located south of Downtown Boston, the South Boston Waterfront is home to a number of restaurants, hotels, convention centers, and the Institute of Contemporary Art. It also has a portion of the Boston Harborwalk, which offers views of the Downtown Boston skyline and Boston Harbor.
Nearest T Stops: South Station (Red Line), from which you can take the Silver Line to a number of destinations in the South Boston Waterfront/Seaport District.
 


It is a temptation as a college student in the Class of 2017 to imagine that somehow 
college was always like this. Particularly at Harvard, it is obvious that, in recent decades, the demographic makeup of our classes has undergone a revolution in terms of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity. 


Recent data published and analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education reveals that the revolution is set to continue, and that the Harvard Class of 2035, as well as other college classes across the United States, will change dramatically in the coming decades. Here are the top five major changes:

Recent data published and analyzed by the Chronicle of Higher Education reveals that the revolution is set to continue, and that the Harvard Class of 2035, as well as other college classes across the United States, will change dramatically in the coming decades. Here are the top five major changes:
1. “Two or more.” Will categories of ethnicity fade into less and less relevancy? The number of students choosing the category of “two of more” for ethnicity will explode to 46.6%. This follows a sharp decline in the number of white, black, and Asian students.

2. White declines the most. Whilst, as above, other racial categories such as black and Asian also decline, the vast majority of the decline in college-aged students comes from white families. This will mean whites losing majority status on even more campuses.
3. Californication. On the whole, the number of college-aged students will decline for the next fourteen years, and California is no exception: A fall from 535,005 to 494,058 is expected. But in Massachusetts the fall from 83,316 to 71,434 is even more dramatic. The net effect? More Californians in college relative to Massachusetts and other New England states with similar demographic profiles. The Californian:Massachusettsian college student ratio will jump in the next fourteen years from 6:41 to 6:91.
 

 
 
4. Fewer rich kids, more poor. Representative of other demographic changes, the number of students coming from richer, whiter, better educated counties will fall sharply, whilst the number coming from more ethnically diverse, poorer and less well educated countries will, for the large part, remain stable or, in some cases, increase. Illustratively, Rockingham County, New Hampshire, home of Phillips Exeter Academy, will see a fall of white students from 4,086 to 2,316 and all other ethnicities from 364 to 297. Whilst Jefferson County, Louisiana, one of the state’s most deprived areas and far less well educated, will experience an increase in students from 5,122 to 5,627. This will certainly test school’s financial aid budgets but provide great opportunity and necessity for school’s to become better at attracting a growing pool of super 
diverse candidates.

diverse candidates.
5. More internationals. What can we speculate will come from this great decline? More internationals. Many international countries are experiencing the opposite population pyramids to a majority of the United States, schools such as Harvard are yet to fully tap into much talent from frontier economies, and the effects of financial aid and opportunity have yet to embed themselves in many countries’ educational cultures. In the Class of 2035, it could be internationals that become the new generation of WASPs: filling gaps in funding, reversing falling enrolments and compensating for ethnic changes.
