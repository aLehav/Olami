After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recent revelations that Harvard has quietly begun fundraising for a capital campaign have prompted speculation on the extent and direction such a program would take. By nature, capital campaigns often do not go public until a significant amount of the money has already been raised. This period, known as the “quiet phase,” allows the university to evaluate its fundraising strength as well as discern projects for which donors have a particular appetite. The latter aspect of this phase is significant in that it means that a capital campaign lacks a clear focus before it is formally announced, but recently administrators and donors have said that the primary focus is raising money for the upcoming House Renewal project. Rebuilding the Allston community, which was left partially desolate in the wake of the delayed Science Complex Project, while still important, is further down on the list of capital campaign priorities.
The House Renewal project represents the sort of forward thinking that Harvard needs to survive and thrive in the years to come. Not only are many Harvard houses falling into disrepair, but some of them even violate existing fire and safety codes. However, the present flaws of the housing system exceed the scope of safety or comfort; Harvard’s housing system no longer fits the ever-evolving concept of life in a residential setting. The sense of community that is currently absent from many of the antiquated houses is a problem that Harvard needs to tackle head on, and this project is a positive step towards achieving that goal.
Harvard University’s decision to undertake this campaign is positive and progressive, but its vision should not be as inward-looking as it currently is; although the capital campaign should include internal improvements, it must prioritize above all else resuming development on the Allston campus and restoring the local community.
The Harvard community is by no means insular. While the institution may only technically educate those within its gates, Harvard still plays an important role in much of the Greater Boston area. It may be a private institution, but it is a private university with a public persona and an even larger public obligation. For years, Harvard has involved itself in the Allston community for the worse, in ways that are far more tangible and much more profound than the problems that the House Renewal project seeks to correct. Given that the stalled plans across the river have negatively affected the health of the community the professional lives of many Allston residents, Harvard has a responsibility to finish this project as soon as the resources become available; to do otherwise not only projects an image of apathy towards the plight of Allston residents, but also establishes the precedent that failed projects adversely affecting communities are acceptable. Relations with much of the Allston community have soured, and a capital campaign in which Allston renewal was a conspicuously absent goal would only further exacerbate an already tense relationship.
For clarity, when comparing the Allston and House Renewal projects, we are not advocating the priority of one project to the detriment the other. Little is worth putting the long-term safety of students at risk, and in the event that the actualization of the Allston plan would necessitate the continuance of unsafe or illegal conditions for students, we would condemn such a decision. However, we see any argument suggesting that prioritizing Allston will adversely affect students as creating a false dichotomy; House Renewal can still continue even while Harvard centers the mission of its capital campaign on completing its Allston projects.
Furthermore, it would be disingenuous to characterize a focus on Allston as merely a means to make amends to a blighted community. The scuttled Science Complex project was conceived for scholastic reasons, and it would have served as the culmination of an academic paradigm shift meant to propel Harvard’s applied science programs into a future of competitiveness with schools like Stanford and MIT. This is a laudable mission, and one not worth abandoning.
There is no reason that the capital campaign cannot have both internal and external ends, but the Allston community must take precedence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Sorry, I was just admiring your shoes. I really like them. Where’d you get them?” she said. “Oh, thanks so much,” I said, taken aback. “I got them in the States.” Her boyfriend chimed in gruffly, “That’s a long way to go for some shoes.” Unlike Blanche DuBois, I am always wary of depending on the kindness of strangers, but in that moment, in the midst of the chaos of the King’s Arms, one of Oxford’s most famous pubs, this random woman’s smile made a world of difference. Because of my shoes, I’d finally “made it.”
More so than in America, shoes here are about both fashion and function. After spending two months on a study abroad program at St. Catherine’s College at Oxford University, I have come to realize just how crucial footwear is to those in countries that rain 24/7. For a wanderer such as myself, I need shoes that will comfortably and unassumingly allow me to blend in as a member of this big, bustling British city. Each morning, I wake up and choose between the few pairs I brought with me. Always a more modest man and rule-centric figure, my dear father advised to bring “only what you can fit in one suitcase.” This has meant that my shoe collection has been limited as I traversed countries throughout Europe this semester.
I did not come empty-handed, though. There are of course the coffee brown, lace-up, mid-ankle boots, padded, mint green studded flats, and chunky, clunky brown-bear-colored boats, which are sturdy as ever and ugly as sin, too. I also have a few pairs of pumps for those special occasions where I awkwardly dance in the corner at formal functions on campus and a pair of woeful tennis shoes that have not seen the light of the sun since I have arrived in England. Part of the reason for that is because there simply is no sun in this region of the world, and the other part is that the Oxford gym and I have not yet established a stable relationship. I resolved, however, not to the let the paucity of my shoe collection stop me. Upon realizing my accent truly does make me stick out like a sore thumb, and that I have an embarrassing inability to understand half of what English people say, I decided that clothing and apparel would be one frontier I could manipulate that would allow me to integrate into my surroundings.
One pair took me to a formal ball with thousands of people, endless champagne, handsomely dressed Brits and constant sources of entertainment. Indeed, that pair of gold strappy heels accompanied me as I wandered from tent to tent with break dancers in one side, a series of videogames in different one, a main room filled with burritos, pizza, hog roast, Asian fusion needles, and several spaces for enjoying the Silent Rave or the comfort of a special friend in the pink-and-red adorned Lover’s Lounge.
On less special occasions, though, when I have given up on trying to impress anyone, I slink into my thick, sturdy chocolate brown boots to help my feet avoid the lovely wetness and grime of Oxfordshire streets. Not only do this clunkers keep my feet warm but they also give me a sense of security: A month and a half into my time here and I am already comfortable enough in myself to let my fashion sense slip in favor of utility. Regardless of the fact that I noticed countless English women’s eyes darting from directly down to the horror of my thick shoes, I firmly believe (sometimes) in the value of shoes that protect one from the outside elements. It no longer matters to me that women were are perfectly coiffed with fake fur coats, thick scarves, professional looking makeup, leggings of all colors of the rainbow, and their overall hipster/preppy swag. I do not care if they dress as though the runway’s nearby at all times. I just need shoes that suit me.
In fact, moments when I have tried to sacrifice comfort for the sake of trying to look cute in the midst of wet weather or crisply cold times always come back to haunt me. For instance, one night, I thought it would me feel more authentically British to wear painfully thin shoes to a club, hoping they would help me to fit in. Instead, all I got was a story about the fact that after waiting 30 minutes in 25-degree weather with my poor toes congealing together in beginning stages of frostbite, an Oompa Loompa cut me in line. This is not a hyperbolic anecdote about an overly-tanned Snooki look-a-like: This girl literally thought it made sense that she should cut me in line spite of being painted orange, wearing a fluorescent green wig and white painted eyebrows.
At this moment, I decided those pumps were made for walking. As I hobbled myself through the cobbled streets that night and wrecked the heels themselves, I started really examining my shoe choices for this semester. It made me re-think how I carried myself and re-charged my motivation to walk about Oxford in a different, more confident way, regardless of my footwear. On the other hand, though, it also gave me a new reason to go on a new shoe-shopping expedition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nestled in a fern planter in the entry to my house, eyes closed and legs crossed, sits a life-size stone Buddha. My mother drove it up some years ago in a blue Isuzu hatchback from an artist colony in Big Sur. It wouldn’t have been my decorating choice: for a long time, in fact, I found it actively distasteful. We weren’t Buddhists. It looked kitschy. It invited awkward questions. And it seemed an uncomfortable relic (something to go with the Flokati rug). In my head I christened the Buddha with the dumb name Mr. B and moved on.
I remembered it on the way to Big Sur, which we finally got round to visiting this January. Car nearly scraping the cliff wall at a corner, there Bixby Bridge suddenly was in front of us: land dropping away and the Pacific stretching for miles, broken only by a lighthouse and craggy rocks. In the backseat I turned the pages of Henry Miller’s “Big Sur and the Oranges of Hieronymous Bosch.” It was easy to see why Miller had chosen to live here for 18 years—the place was a half-dream. It made even the exiled Polish poet Czeslaw Milosz pause for breath: In his diary of 1987 he wrote that “between steep hills, there is a gully formed by a stream; luxuriant grass, trees, shade, bindweed, masses of lady’s-smock near the water, the same magical greenery that appeared near the ancient cloister in Nonza.”
Like all those places skirting the Pacific along Highway 1 from Eureka to Pismo Beach, though, Big Sur is ultimately a small town. There are hamburger shacks, gas stations, maybe a pie shop if you’re lucky, but mostly it’s surrounded by uninhabited wilderness. Miller writes grandiosely that this is “paradise. There being nothing to improve on in the surroundings, the tendency is to set about improving oneself.” And yet, as quickly becomes clear, “paradise” is full of quirky characters I know would drive me mad. One of the more innocuous is one “Gilbert,” who “would rub himself down with olive oil and hide behind the bushes in back of the house to take a sun bath, the music going full blast—Shostakovich, Gaspard de la Nuit, Beethoven quartets, Vivaldi, flamenco, Cantor Rosenblatt.” An unnamed Samoan bully lurks in the hot springs to accost bathers with facts about India, and Miller’s houseguest Conrad “Devil in Paradise” Moricand’s constant requests for specially-sized writing paper, fancy toothpaste, exotic drugs, and Gauloises bleues grow so exasperating Miller is forced to evict him.
Deep down, Miller realizes the snags in his utopia, and some pages later amends his statement: “Certainly paradise, whatever it be, contains flaws. One’s destination is never a place but a new way of looking.” What follow are subtle meditations on how to live in an imperfect world: “Even if it lasts for only a few moments, the privilege of looking at the world as a spectacle of unending life and not as a repository of persons, creatures, and objects to be impressed into our service is never to be forgotten.” This comes as a refreshing alternative to some of the less subtle socially activist writing of the late 1950s.
What Miller means is that paradise is never given—it must be manmade. But there are two ways in which this paradise might be created. One is through revolution; the other is by adapting what already exists. There is value to recognizing the breaking point—when the current leader is performing so poorly, and civil liberties are so endangered, that the government is not worth preserving. But there is value too in recognizing the need for patience, compromise, and willingness to endure the slowness of constitutional reform in the long years until the next election.
The most interesting question regarding the revolts in Arab countries to me is not necessarily where they are happening (the pressure cooker of the Middle East, in countries headed by authoritative leaders) or how (“social media”), but why they are happening at this moment in particular. Writers from media outlets from MSNBC to the Wall Street Journal have issued statements supporting the rebels in defense of freedom, democracy, and the Arab equivalent of apple pie. But el-Qaddafi has been in power for four decades, nearly all tumultuous ones: periodically replacing the concrete frame of his bullet-proof tent and replenishing his retinue of 40 virgins. It is true that many factors in Libya make full-scale action difficult (a very diverse ethnic and linguistic population including 140 distinct tribes, a strong Sufi element promoting a metaphysical rather than activist Islam, arbitrary arrests and government censorship), but nothing about these obstacles makes them any easier or more difficult to overcome now than before. How does one explain such protracted forbearance in the civilian population?
Strangely enough, it was while suffering undemocratic conditions that the Libyan population proved itself most ably. Merit exists in seeking to adapt to circumstances first, rather than immediately turning to physical violence. A critical moment, real or perceived, did arrive, and action was necessary—but the perseverance up to the point of agitation should also be admired.
America, unlike Libya, is not prepared for or in need of violence in the streets, but in many aspects it does remain badly in need of change—through reformism, not revolution. Opening the door back home, the first thing I saw was the Buddha, serene despite the barking dog and the talking television in the next room someone had forgotten. The country was still going through a “jobless recovery”: indeed, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics, 13.9 million Americans are still unemployed. It will be a long, slow process to set things right. But Miller had found his utopia in Big Sur; and I thought that we can work at making this country unspoiled for us; and somehow, very far from home, Mr. B, too, had found his paradise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Get your dance on to the “Zenga Zenga Song” like well over two million other people have. By all means, join me in my disbelief at each speech on Al-Jazeera or read the quotes in which he “dares you” you to find dead protesters as media outlets display photos of those very fallen. Just do not give Muammar al-Gaddafi what he wants—and put pressure on Western nations to intervene in Libya.
In February of 2009, I argued that Gaddafi was right to argue for more African unity. That seems a lot longer than two years ago at the present, as Gaddafi attacks his own people through mercenaries and air strikes. I would never give credit to Gaddafi for anything right now, except for his bid for most egomaniacal leader in the world. Yet in a perverse way, Gaddafi’s old pet project could have proven useful in the current situation. With balanced leadership, a stronger African Union could have helped put a stop to the mercenary units Gaddafi has rented out around the continent and now called back to suppress his people. Such an organization could have also threatened and used military force to limit the attacks Gaddafi forces are making in waves on cities held by the rebels. An African-initiated no-fly zone might have stopped the bombing runs.
Africa could have taken measures that the West currently can only “consider” and debate. France and the United Kingdom have demanded a no-fly zone, but this term has almost taken on a life of itself. As Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has recently pointed out, no-fly zones require violence. To set one up in Libya, NATO planes would have to bomb Libya’s air defenses. That accomplished, the no-fly zone would entail shooting down any Libyan planes that then entered the airspace to attack rebel positions.
Gaddafi, I believe, would privately welcome this move. In his struggle with the rebels, his troops have not fared very well. From various accounts, Counterattacks have been repulsed by  volunteer troops made up largely of civilians and semi-trained soldiers operating outdated equipment or arriving on the scene completely unarmed. They bring to mind the almost suicidal bravery of those who famously advanced without weapons against the Nazis at Stalingrad. Those Russian forces, however, were defending their homeland from invasion. The Libyans must defend their homeland from within its own leadership.
And that is exactly how this crisis must stay. It cannot devolve into a situation in which Gaddafi’s crazy claims of foreign agency gain any validity. The situation is unfair; forty years of rule under Gaddafi was also unfair. So, perhaps, is the legacy of the Iraq War on America’s options here. Nicholas D. Kristof’s latest column in the New York Times has also made this point. His alternatives to U.S. military intervention, however, depended heavily on an Arab League and African Union no-fly zone. Now it is apparent that the Arab League will not agree to such a step.
Blame the Arab League for its passivity. But do not think that the United States, or any other body, possesses the political capital to create such a zone on its own. Military intervention by the United States would run the risk of galvanizing Gaddafi’s supporters and delegitimizing his protestors. At most, the U.S. government should be applying much more pressure on its allies in the Arab League and Africa to take stronger action.
The history books must never have to debate “who really won the Libyan revolution.” If this effort is to succeed, it must come from the strength of the Libyan people. They have certainly been dealt an unlucky hand: Without his ability to exploit his nation’s oil reserves, Gaddafi’s regime would have been out faster than whatever advisers told Beyoncé and Mariah Carey it was a good idea to sing for big bucks at Gaddafi family private parties.
From the United   States and Western nations, there is not much we can do to help. We can contribute to aid organizations working to mitigate the growing refugee crisis on the Tunisian border. We can read reports, stay informed, and make sure that Libya remains part of the national dialogue—especially in our outlets of debate, from classrooms to Institute of Politics Forums.
No matter how bizarre Gaddafi acts, however, we cannot compromise ourselves by demanding our country flex its muscles for the cause. It would be so easy to ground his underfunded, corrupt air force if we tried—the two assault ships the U.S. sent through the Suez Canal on Wednesday could probably do it on their own.
It’s tempting to demand more from our governments, and even more tempting for governments like France and the United Kingdom to claim they will give their people what they want. In this case, however, what many of us want is to end this tragic farce of a final act in Gaddafi’s dictatorship. Yet to allow for any positive outcome from the situation, we must accept what we are—sitting this one out, a nation of unwilling cheerleaders.

A photograph of a centipede-inspired robot won two Harvard affiliates an “Honorable Mention” in the 2010 International Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge last month.
The photograph was developed by School of Engineering and Applied Sciences graduate student Katie L. Hoffman and SEAS professor Robert J. Wood.
Science Magazine and the National Science Foundation awarded Hoffman and Wood in the photography category for their “centipede millibot.”
Hoffman said the competition asked contestants to take a picture that could convey an interesting scientific idea or device to the general public. She said she used a digital SLR camera to take the photograph, which contained no special effects or additional editing.
“I just spent a lot of time trying to take a good picture of the robot because I thought it was a pretty picture,” Hoffman said.
The photo includes a 12-legged, segmented robot perched next to an only slightly smaller penny, atop a reflective surface. The top view shows the mechanical devices controlling the movement of the legs, each of which is engraved with the words “Harvard Microrobotics Lab” in 150-micrometer-wide text.
The reflection shows the connections between the segments, which are made out of carbon fiber, a flexible material used to create “soft” robots.
Hoffman said she has worked on the “centipede millibot” for the past year and a half as part of her research in the Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory, which focuses on engineering on a small-scale. Hoffman said she uses the centipede-like robot to study the locomotion of centipedes.
Wood, an associate professor of electrical engineering, serves as the administrator to the Microrobotics Laboratory. Hoffman said he helped her assemble the robot and encouraged her to enter the contest. “I believe there is great value in the ability to convey the story of a research project visually and in a manner that is both accessible and exciting,” Wood said. “Katie [Hoffman]’s photo describes her device in a way much more effective than words.”
In 2009, SEAS researchers at the Aizenberg Biomineralization and Biomimetics Lab won first prize in the same challenge for their photo entitled “Save Our Earth, Let’s Go Green,” which depicted tiny “fingers” made out of polymer hairs cradling a tiny green sphere representing the Earth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It took Krishna M. Prabhu ’11 two years to decide to commit to pursuing a career in medicine, but after working in a South African tuberculosis hospital the summer after his sophomore year, he took the plunge.
Now, Prabhu is writing a Social Studies thesis on the practice of medicine in South Africa and why doctors choose to work in certain hospitals. He plans to take a year off after graduation before attending medical school.
Rachel A. Levy ’11, on the other hand, came into college certain that she wanted to be a doctor. After falling in love with the English Department, she says she decided to pursue both interests. After all, she points out, “Keats had studied medicine before becoming a poet.”
Prabhu and Levy are two of many students at Harvard who recognize a value in pursuing pre-medical studies in conjunction with a concentration in the humanities or social sciences.
According to Harvard Medical School Professor Anne E. Becker ’83, more people have begun to appreciate the interface between the social sciences and clinical medicine. Becker, whose research has focused on social determinants of eating disorders, refers to herself as a “physician anthropologist.”
“I think there’s a better appreciation of the translation of empirical knowledge, not just from the bench to the bedside, but from the bedside to care delivery to the community,” she says. “A focus on social sciences in the undergrad years can really broaden perspective.”
And while balancing pre-med requirements with a non-science concentration requires students to straddle two very different disciplines, students who have chosen the route say they are excited about the chance to study what they love.
“Being a doctor [is] a career path [where] I think a lot of people want to end up, but you don’t have to take a linear path to get there,” says Maya E. Pena ’12 , a history concentrator.
A REFRESHING BALANCE
Many social science and humanities concentrators who are also pre-meds say they are not concerned with switching gears from problem sets to heavy reading. In fact, many say they welcome the balance.
“Social Studies forces you into an ivory tower,” says Prabhu. “Science classes help ground a person.”
For many future doctors, college is their last chance to study a field unrelated to science. These concentrators say the skills they are learning in their concentration classes will be very useful in the medical field.
“[In] Gen Eds and higher level Ec classes on global health and American health care policy, having a background in economics is pretty helpful in being able to understand some of the papers that are very quantitative,” says David Wang ’12, an economics concentrator who is also pursuing a secondary in Global Health and Health Policy.
Wang says he wants to run a hospital one day, and is considering a joint MD/MBA program after college.
Tenley A. Malmquist ’13, a pre-med and joint concentrator in anthropology and Romance Languages and Literature, says she decided not to study neurobiology after a summer trip to Honduras confirmed her passion for archaeology and languages and piqued her interest in a “Doctors Without Borders-kind of career.”
“Being bilingual helps in any profession,” she says.
Pena adds that the heavy writing demands of social science and humanities courses give students strong communication skills that will be useful when writing grant proposals or journal articles.
And students and professors alike say that the critical thinking and analytical skills fostered in the humanities and social sciences departments go a long way in the hospital.
“One thing historians are really good at is working with uncertainty. We never have information,” says Brett Flehinger, a lecturer in history and resident dean of Lowell House. “You become comfortable with what you don’t know. Doctors work that way a lot of the time.”
THE SOCIAL DIMENSION
Anisha R. Kumar ’12, an anthropology concentrator, has conducted numerous interviews for her thesis, which concerns medical anthropology. She says the notion of “medicine as a social profession” is an important one—and does not necessarily reveal itself through science classes alone.
She adds that her thesis has allowed her to explore “the lived experience of an individual [through] personal contact.”
Ja-Yoon “Uni” Choe ’12, another humanities-studying pre-med, conducts research with the Boston University School of Social Work aimed at improving health service to Asian American women in the Greater Boston Area.
The Women, Gender and Sexuality concentrator took classes at the Harvard School of Public Health last semester and says she found that the intersection of gender and health was rife for exploration, especially in the Asian American community.
The social implications of medicine also appealed to Hillary L. Ditmars ’12, who says that this interest convinced her to begin pre-medical studies in her junior year. Ditmars, a Social Studies concentrator, interned at the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland last summer and realized that she wanted to work directly with patients rather than craft health policy.
“It’s really, really important work, but it also made me realize thinking and writing about health in an abstract way wasn’t what I wanted to do,” she says.
Ditmars plans to complete a year of post-baccalaureate studies to finish her pre-med requirements. Nonetheless, she says her background in Social Studies is integral to her interest in becoming a doctor.
“If you’re studying medicine, it’s really important to have an understanding of the way a person’s social and cultural position affect ... health,” she says.
CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
Despite the benefits of pursuing their passions, several pre-meds who study the humanities or social sciences note that balancing divergent disciplines at Harvard comes with its own set of challenges.
Several students contacted for this article say they have had to sacrifice electives in order to fulfill requirements for both fields.
“That’s probably one of the biggest downsides, not being able to take a random class on acting, or drama,” says Prabhu, who is currently enrolled in organic chemistry while also writing a senior thesis.
But Flehinger, the history lecturer, says he believes the Gen Ed program has done a lot for pre-meds looking to fulfill distribution and pre-med requirements at the same time.
Several students also say they face the challenge of convincing laboratories and medical schools that they are equipped to handle greater workloads in science.
“I found when I was applying to work in labs over the summer ... it was a little bit difficult to convince them that I was qualified to work in the lab,” says Kumar.
Not taking as many science courses can also impact a student’s ability to find a consistent group of study companions. Wang says he has a “lot of friends through doing problem sets together,” but that it is much more difficult to find people who can share his cross-disciplinary perspective and work demands.
“The pre-meds that are majoring in science together, they have more of a camaraderie,” says Choe. “Being a humanities major, I feel like I need to come up with my own path.”
While Choe says she enjoys the “creative license” this independent path brings, she admits that it can be “kind of stressful.”
Many of these pre-meds say that finding advisers with an interdisciplinary perspective can also be difficult. While several students say they have found support from the Office of Career Services, pre-med tutors in their houses, or professors in their respective departments, they note that not everyone has first-hand experience with melding the two disciplines.
“One thing that I wish we had more was diversity among the pre-med advisers. I haven’t been able to speak a lot to those [who] majored in humanities,” says Choe.
Ultimately, however, many students say that the diversity of their studies actually reinforces their desire to pursue medicine.
“Because I was in a situation where people around me were looking at other concentrations, I questioned whether I really wanted to do medicine,” says Kumar.
“I definitely think concentrating in a non-science while being pre-med is one of the best decisions I made at Harvard.”

Adults who regularly take ibuprofen have a reduced risk of developing Parkinson’s disease relative to non-users, according to a study conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.
The researchers concluded that adults who regularly take ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, two or more times a week have a 30 to 40 percent lower risk of developing the neurodegenerative disease than those who do not.
The findings suggest that the inexpensive over-the-counter drug could potentially protect neurons from degeneration, said lead author Xiang Gao, an instructor in  medicine at HSPH.
But Gao added that the researchers do not recommend that people start taking more Ibuprofen-containing drugs, such as Advil or Motrin.
“As our study is an observational study, we cannot make [conclusions] of causality,” Gao said.
Ibuprofen could also be beneficial for individuals with early stage Parkinson’s Disease, said senior author Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiology professor at HSPH.
But he said the results of the study do not indicate that patients with Parkinson’s should begin to take more Ibuprofen, which can have side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.
“We do not recommend that anyone should take ibuprofen for the prevention or treatment of PD, except as part of a rigorously conducted clinical trial,” said Ascherio.
The researchers analyzed data on disease incidence using two long-term epidemiological studies: the Nurses’ Health Study, which has tracked the health of more than 100,000 registered nurses, and the Health Professional Follow-Up Study, which has followed more than 50,000 male health professionals.
The study did not find protective effects of aspirin or other NSID drugs against the risk of Parkinson’s disease, said Gao.
Gao said the next step for the researchers is to investigate the effect of Ibuprofen on patients with Parkinson’s disease, particularly with an eye to understanding whether a causal relationship exists.
“Future studies should investigate whether Ibuprofen can slow disease progression among people with Parkinson’s disease,” said Gao.
The study was published online on Wednesday in the journal Neurobiology and is scheduled to be published in the print issue on March 8.

Researchers at Harvard and University of California, San Francisco have developed a model for human leukemia in mice, a breakthrough that may allow scientists to more effectively study human cancers.
The researchers focused on a type of leukemia known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a disease largely caused by genetic mutations that increases the production of potentially cancerous proteins known as Ras proteins. The disease is reported to cause roughly 9,000 deaths in the U.S. annually, according to the National Cancer Institute.
The study found that mutations in two genes for different Ras proteins—known as Nras and Kras—induced AML symptoms in mice. But mutations in Nras were found to cause a slower, more benign disease progression.
The study highlights a critical distinction in disease-specific cancer treatments, said Harvard Medical School Assistant Professor of Pathology Kevin M. Haigis, a co-author of the study. He added that the findings reveal how functional differences between genes arise in different disease scenarios.
According to the researchers, the findings hold significant implications.
“For many, many years people thought all the Ras proteins were the same, so if you made a drug that could effectively treat one type of Ras cancer, you could use that for all Ras cancers,” said Haigis. “What we’re beginning to learn now is that not all the Ras genes are the same—Kras is different from Nras, so the therapies for treating these cancers is different.”
Haigis said that the research was founded upon the observation that mutations in these genes are commonly found in instances of human AML.
“While these genes are highly related, human cancer studies suggest that they can be different in their function,” Haigis said.
“In the Kras mice, the disease occurs so fast that it’s hard to study, but in Nras mice, we see a much more indolent, slow-moving disorder,” said Scott C. Kogan ’86, a professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF and co-author of the study.
Kogan said that the work might enable scientists to gain a deeper understanding as to how genetic changes contribute to AML, adding that his team is currently using the model to understand the pathogenesis of the disease.
The researchers mentioned that they are continuing to explore new avenues of focus with their model.
“We’re developing models showing [that] the model mimics human disease, and we plan to use these models to test ideas about treatments.” said Kogan.
The study was published in a recent issue of the hematology journal Blood.

On weeknights, Alex Vasic ’13 can often be found in the lab, where he studies hematopoeitic stem cells, the cells responsible for maintenance of the blood and the immune system.
Hematopoeitic stem cells—HSCs for short—have a limited lifespan, and replacement cells must be steadily generated.
Specifically, Vasic studies these stem cells located in bone marrow in Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Professor David T. Scadden’s stem cell laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital.
He analyzes how HSCs can be used in the treatment of illnesses such as leukemia and other diseases derived from the overproduction of blood cells.
When stem cells are not functioning properly, the possibility of an overproduction of a certain type of cells arises, and with it, the danger of leukemia. Treatment is targeted in the area of the marrow through traditional deterring methods like radiation, followed by a transplant of new cells, whose success is not guaranteed. In light of the risks associated with this kind of treatment, Vasic is working on ways to avoid using chemotherapy and employ small non-toxic cells instead.
When it comes to the controversies surrounding stem cell research, Vasic explains that in the case of his research, there are no moral implications. He uses adult stem cells, not embryonic cells, and adheres to the ethical standards of lab research.
Vasic, a Canadian from Toronto, is second generation Serbian. His parents’ origins have shaped and fueled his fascination with science, Vasic says, as well as his inclination to help those who lack opportunity to help themselves.Indeed, much of the motivation driving his study of stem cells derives from his family’s affinity for science.
With an engineer as a father, high expectations were part of the daily routine, he says.
But his particular research focus arose in high school, when he attended a few lectures on scientific innovations. One year, a talk was on the potential of using either stem cells or embryonic cells for research purposes.
Despite his long lab hours, Vasic has maintained a personal and social life. Winston S. Waters II ’13, a friend and entryway mate, says Vasic’s ability to maintain a positive work-social life balance.
“His stem cell research just adds another dimension to his complexity, his personality and his identity, in general,” Waters says.
Although Vasic suspects he will work with patients in the future, he says his research experience has allowed him to appreciate the potential of the science to improve medical treatment.

Professor of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics Michael P. Brenner was awarded the George Ledlie Prize this week for his innovative and interdisciplinary research, as well as his commitment to education.
The Ledlie Prize is a University honor awarded every other year since 1956 to a Harvard affiliate deemed to have made the most significant recent achievements towards the advancement of science.
Brenner’s work at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—where he has been a faculty member since 2001—has focused primarily on applying both old and new mathematical methods to a wide range of scientific questions. His research has often led him to collaborate with faculty members from other departments.
For example, Brenner worked with  Associate Professor of Chemical Engineering and Physics Vinothan N. Manoharan to gain a better understanding of the assembly of very small spheres into well-defined structures using mathematical models.
“We’ve been working to try to figure out what the rules are, and how one would design a system to get it to assemble into a desired structure as opposed to any other structure,” Brenner said.
Faculty and students say that Brenner—also the area dean of Applied Mathematics—brings the same interdisciplinary approach into practice within the classroom.
Brenner created Applied Mathematics 50—an overview course that introduces prospective concentrators to the use of mathematics in different fields—and was involved in the creation this year of the popular course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to the Science of Soft Matter.”
“His courses have a creative, different architecture,” said Marie D. Dahleh, assistant dean for academic programs at SEAS.
“He works diligently to devise his curricula.”
Paula M. Maouyo ’14, who took “Science and Cooking” last semester, said she admired the course for its “great interdisciplinary approach.”
“The course combined cooking and science without compromising the science part,” she added.
Brenner said he hopes to continue to enhance the undergraduate concentration in Applied Mathematics.
“I know for a fact that I will continue to explore more compelling scientific questions using mathematical models,” he added.

Harvard researchers have recently discovered that cell migration can be modeled after the movement of colloidal glass—a finding that could have significant implications for future medical research.
The results of their study represent a new way of understanding the movement of aggregations of cells—an area in which previous research has been sparse, according to co-author Jeffrey J. Fredberg, professor of bioengineering and physiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
“Imagine a busy stadium, people jostle and push each other to get in. Well, cells do the same,” he said. “We now have been able to measure, analyze and understand the relationship between [those] forces and the motions.”
Co-author David A. Weitz, professor of physics and applied physics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said he was surprised by the results, which showed that the movement of masses of cells can take on glass-like properties.
“We would never have expected that inanimate and animate objects would have the same properties,” he said.
Vinothan N. Manoharan, associate professor of chemical engineering and physics at SEAS who was not involved with the study, said that he felt his colleagues’ research was promising.
“Physical laws that govern the dynamics of these cell systems haven’t been studied at this level of detail before,” he said.
The results, which were published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Feb. 14,  may have significant implications for medical research in fields such as cancer treatment.
For example, the process of cancer metastasis—by which cancerous tumors spread to different parts of the body—may be better understood if modeled after the properties of glass, Weitz said.
In this case, the model suggests that future research on cancer treatment should be targeted at methods to slow down the migration of tumors, rather than at reducing their density, said co-author Thomas E. Angelini, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Florida.
“Perhaps the solution is to get healthy cells to squeeze the cancerous cells together,” Angelini said.
Weitz added that cells also flow like glass during the process of wound healing, as well as during embryonic development.
“If you use the descriptions for glass, it is a very good description of the motions of the cells,” he said. “That’s what’s cool.”

A proposal to separate middle schools from elementary schools in the Cambridge Public System—known as the “Innovation Agenda”—will be discussed by the School Committee meeting on March 8, a week before it is scheduled to come up for a vote.
The new plan, which was presented to the Committee on Feb. 1, seeks to turn the upper grades at four of Cambridge’s K-8 schools into separate middle schools, which will serve the entire Cambridge community.
Cambridge currently has 12 schools that serve grades K-8 but no middle schools that operate independently.
The reform package grew out of Superintendent Jeffrey M. Young’s 2009-2010 Middle School Study.
In a public letter sent on December 20, Young called the reform a “milestone” in the transformation of public schools and said that the goal is “to become the most academically successful urban school district in the state by harnessing the riches of the Cambridge community and preparing all students for college and 21st century success.”
The proposal seeks to address disparate levels of preparation that were observed in students at the high school level, according to Cambridge Public Schools Chief of Staff Lori L. Likis.
Endorsing the overarching goal of the proposal, Public School Committee member Marc C. McGovern said that “we have to address the inequities in our system both educationally and socially.”
The proposal also aims to address some of the bigger issues in Cambridge education, such as the achievement gap and controlled choice—a placement program that attempts to increase diversity based on socioeconomic status rather than race.
In the new system, public schools serving grades K-5 will be paired up with a larger school that incorporates an independent middle school. “[The pairing] requires that we balance schools in terms of socioeconomic status,” Likis said.
But McGovern expressed doubts as to whether the proposal could bridge the achievement gap.
“Kids come to kindergarten ... with a gap existing. If we really want to close the achievement gap in the long term, we should be focusing on early childhood education,” he said.
Another concern that several School Committee members shared is that there is no proposed middle school in the Cambridgeport area.
“There is a whole section of the city that is not going to have a middle school, and that seems little unfair,” Nolan said.
McGovern said he supports the creation of a fifth middle school in the Cambridgeport area in order to address the issue.
Some also expressed concerns that the new plans would require Cambridge’s bilingual K-8 schools to split into an elementary school and a bilingual middle school.
“It’s really difficult for an immersion program when it’s in two different locations,” McGovern said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction.
CORRECTION: MAR. 6, 2011
The Mar. 4 article "Cambridge Public Schools Consider Reforms" misquoted Marc C. McGovern in two instances. Referring to Cambridge's bilingual education options, McGoven said that "immersion," not "emerging," programs are difficult to maintain. Additionally, the article quoted McGoven as saying educational inequities need to be addressed "educationally and academically" when, in fact, he said that such problems need to be solved "educationally and socially."

For many juniors who have been seeking internships in consulting and finance through Harvard’s on-campus interview program, today is the deadline to decide whether to decline or accept outstanding offers.
According to preliminary data from the Office of Career Services, 554 juniors—or 33 percent of the Class of 2012—participated in the On-Campus Interview program this year, leading to roughly 11,174 internship applications in total and an average number of five interviews per student.
This year, interviews through the OCI program began on Jan. 28, the first Friday of the spring semester.
OCS has made an effort to shorten the timeline of the recruiting process from six weeks to five weeks this spring, according to Deborah A. Carroll, director of the on-campus interview program.
OCS has made it a policy for participating companies that they must give students until March 4 or three weeks after offer date—whichever comes later—to make a final decision.
“Definitely this year we are finding a lot of organizations weren’t getting their offers out early enough for the March 4th deadline to reply, but that students have three weeks of notice for most of them,” Carroll said.
Sometimes the March 4 deadline allows students more time to consider their summer prospects, making sure that students are given the chance to fully evaluate internship offers that came in at different times.
“The March 4th date is to even the playing field among those who come on the first day and those who come on the third week so that students can compare,” Carroll said.
Yet even with the OCS policy in place, students in the recruiting process say they have had mixed experience interacting with the firms.
Some students say they are not facing much pressure in terms of decision-making, such as Daniel C. Norris ’12, who quickly accepted an offer made by Bain & Company this past Monday.
Other students, however, say they have faced more pressure from the companies that offered them internships.
“I got an exploding offer on my first day. [They told me] ‘you have to tell us in two days if you want to take this.’ ... This was a good place but it was just putting me at an awkward spot,” said Sanjay P. Misra ’12.
According to Carroll, OCS has dealt with many cases in which students were not given enough time to make decisions on offers. Carroll said that the Office encourages students to speak up about the issue, as “it is always [OCS’s] place to enforce the rule.”
“We definitely had a lot of students come in this spring, and we have a sort of multi-pronged approach to this,” Carroll said.
“We can coach students on how to make sure that they get enough time on their own, as some of them are pretty nervous about having OCS [intervene]. At the same time we absolutely can call employers,” Carroll said.

A group of foreign correspondents, radio hosts, and museum curators emphasized the importance of global citizenship while also taking the tastes of local audiences into account in two panel discussions at the Harvard Kennedy School yesterday.
The program, entitled “Bronzes and Broadcasts” and sponsored by the Hauser Center for Non-Profit Organizations, began with a discussion of the challenges generated when national news outlets disseminate information to the rest of the world.
“We’ve recognized that if you’re a national program, you’re an international program”, said Robin Young, host of WBUR’s Here and Now.
While discussing the importance of social media in today’s reporting, Young added that WBUR was able to produce some of the first reports from Egyptian civilians in Cairo’s Tahrir Square protests by using Twitter rather than waiting for correspondents on the ground.
But audience expectations can also have a negative effect on news coverage, said current Nieman Fellow Jennifer Eccleston.
Eccleston, a CNN foreign correspondent currently based in Rome, acknowledged that CNN often assesses the market value of a story to their audience and tailors their broadcasts accordingly.
“[CNN’s reporting] remains painstakingly objective”, she said. “But the audience for un-garnished news is getting smaller each year.”
Catering too much to audience reaction, national news can end up frustratingly incomplete in comparison to international news, Eccleston said.
In the second panel, four panelists discussed a dilemma facing museums in an ever globalizing world: how to grow their audiences while serving their local and global communities.
Teresa A. Carbone, director of the Brooklyn Museum, said her museum continuously caters to the local community. Founded as a populist institution, it attempts to serve the whole of a diverse community through a variety of exhibitions and the juxtaposition of objects from different cultures.
“Our job is to find a compelling enough reason to make every person in our community come to our doors,” she said.
However, Dan L. Monroe, CEO and Executive Director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass., said that in many museums there is still an inherent bias against non-Western art that is often overlooked.
For example unknown compositions of African Art are often attributed only to a specific tribe, ignoring the fact that an unknown artist, not a whole culture, created it.
Anne Hawley, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, explained that artists from all over the globe are brought to her museum to both create art and teach to local children.
She and her fellow panel members emphasized that it was important to expose children to museums with a global scope early in life.
“We’re both very local and very global,” Hawley said.

Iran is one of eight countries where homosexuality is a crime punishable by death—but also a country in which sex-change operations are legal, said Organization for Refuge Asylum and Migration founder Neil Grungras in a discussion last night about LGBT rights in the Middle East.
The event featured a 30-minute screening of the movie “Be Like Others,” an official selection of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival which explored the nuanced and complicated social phenomenon of sex reassignment surgery in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Iran, described by Grungras as a country fraught with strict and conservative social mores, is among the “most dangerous countries in world to be LBGT in terms of government persecution.”
Grungras traced the origins of the unusual permissibility of—and sometimes even the encouragement and subsidization of—sex-change operations in the otherwise conservative country to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. After the Iranian Revolution, Khomeini issued a religious edict to make sex reassignment surgery permissible for “diagnosed transsexuals,” giving rise to a generation of young Iranian men adopting transsexual identities, Grungras said.
“The government ideology is, if you are homosexual, you must have been born into the wrong body, so the only obstacle that remains is to change sex,” he said. “The complex situation in Iran includes social stigma, legislation, subsidies, and corruption that comes together tend to compel or force people who are lesbian and gay to have sex reassignment.”
The government position on sex-change surgeries can leave individuals who are transgender or choose not to opt for surgery in an uncomfortable situation, he added.
Emma Q. Wang ‘12, co-chair of Queer Students and Allies—which co-sponored the event along with the Harvard Undergraduate Legal Committee, Trans Task Force, and the Radcliffe Union of Students—said she plans to stay involved with ORAM, the first organization focusing exclusively on refugees fleeing from sexual and gender-based violence. She plans to write her thesis on LBGT individuals who have successfully sought asylum in the United States.
Wang, Samuel J. Bakkila ’11-’12, and Jia Hui Lee ‘12 worked at ORAM for two weeks over January Term at its headquarters in San Francisco, where they compiled country profiles and examined benefits for refugees in certain countries, such as housing stipends or subsidies for HIV treatment.
“I learned a lot about issues facing refugees,” Lee said. “It got me thinking about law school.”

With midterm season in full force, Lamont Library Café worker Sharon S. Song ’12 says business is booming.
“You can definitely tell that there is a greater rush during midterm season,” she says.
At a certain point every semester, the atmosphere on campus noticeably shifts as midterm season leads into Housing Day and the subsequent Spring Break.
Already, science students have tackled exams in Life Sciences 1b and Physical Sciences 1, while the introductory course Ec 10, one of the largest undergraduate classes, held its first midterm of the semester on Wednesday.
For many students, the surge in workload can be tough to handle.
“I have to go to practice, come home from practice exhausted, and then take a math midterm at 7:00,” says lightweight rower Andrew J. Campbell ’14. “What sort of cruel person would do this to me?”
For some particularly unlucky students, exams will conflict with one of the most festive days of the year.
With Housing Day—when freshmen are sorted into their respective Houses—approaching next Thursday, their celebrations may have to wait.
The exams will fall amidst the chaos of House pride across campus, and for some, will follow an evening of partying the night before.
Some of the most popular courses are holding exams that date, including the introductory Psychology course, Science of Living Systems 20, taught by Professor Stephen A. Pinker, and the large sociology class Sociology 43: “Social Interaction.”
In order to accommodate for housing day and the demands currently on thesis writers, other classes—such as Ethical Reasoning 24: “Bioethics”—have moved their midterms from Housing Day to after the Spring Break.
But other students face similarly unfortunate scheduling.
“I’ve had Ec 10 yesterday, have Math 1b tonight, and an essay due Friday,” says Fritzi Reuter ’14. “So I’ve not really had a chance to properly think about each one.”
“The hard part was probably balancing my entire schedule,” says Gorick Ng ’14. “Not so much the work itself, but the fact that there was so much going on.”
But for some of those more seasoned Harvard students, midterms have become routine.
After three and a half years, James C. Winter ’11 says he is unfazed by his three midterms in one week.
“As a senior, it’s standard operating procedure. Everyone has one or two weeks in which they have multiple midterms to study for,” he says. “So at this point it’s just business as usual.”

The zesty aroma of hot sauce permeates through the kitchen as a group of freshmen enters Annenberg Dining Hall.
“Yes! They are serving the red spiced chicken!” one of the students says, giving high fives to his friends.
The red spiced chicken breast—consistently ranked the Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services’ top five favorite dishes—is a recipe submitted by the parents of a Harvard undergraduate through a program called Recipes from Home. The entree was so popular when first introduced several years ago that it became a regular menu item.
During winter break, HUHDS sends a postcard to parents asking them to send in their favorite home-style recipe, which are featured in the undergraduate dining halls from mid-February to March.
As part of the program, a tradition that has been in existence for more than 10 years, HUHDS receives recipes from parents of students from every class, every House, and every part of the world, HUHDS spokesperson Crista Martin said.
“It’s fun to see what people are eating at home,” Martin said. “We get a glimpse into the food culture around the world.”
Before the Internet, parents had to fill out the postcard by hand and return it. Now everything can be submitted online through the HUHDS website.
Once all the recipes are submitted, Martin said she distributes them to the chefs, who then select which ones to showcase in the dining halls.
“We try to pick the one that caters to a huge number of students,said Luiz C. DaCosta, chef production manager at Kirkland and Eliot Houses.
Finding a dish that can be made in large quantities is not always easy, DaCosta said. An upperclassman dining hall serves an average House population of about 400 students, with Annenberg serving more than 1,600 freshmen.
Arlene B. Richburg, chef production manager at Lowell and Winthrop Houses, said that although she loved a submitted recipe for sticky buns, it wasn’t feasible to make hundreds of sticky buns to serve in the dining hall.
“I’d love to do it for a smaller group,” Richberg said, “but I also want to do justice to the recipe.”
Richberg, who said she tries to make about three to four recipes from home per week, said the white chicken chili was so popular that she cooked extra for the baked potato and chili bar.
Martin said popular recipes from home are sometimes incorporated into the HUHDS’ regular menu, just like the red spiced chicken breast.
Other recipes that have been featured this year include cheese polenta, pork loin with artichoke sauce, Creole chicken, and Pavlova, a meringue-based dessert.
Megan MacMillan, mother of Kathryn G. MacMillan ’13, submitted a pasta dish with avocados and roasted peppers. She named it “Out of the Ballpark” because Kathryn’s brother had hit his first Little League home run on the day she cooked it.
“The recipe was an instant hit at our house here in Colorado,” MacMillan said. “It has remained a family favorite ever since.”
MacMillan said her daughter enjoyed a little taste of home at Harvard when the Leverett House dining hall highlighted the entrée in February. She said Kathryn called her immediately to say that it had been well-received.
“We are grateful that the dining services are more than just three square meals. Students seem to enjoy time to linger and socialize around the healthy food options,” MacMillan said.

The Harvard community filled Memorial Church last night in a service of compline to honor the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes.
Gomes—who served as the church’s beloved minister and the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals for the past 35 years—died on Monday evening.
While the 40-minute ceremony was light on mentions of Gomes himself, it served as a powerful testament to his legacy and following at Harvard and beyond.
The pews were lined with a diverse representation of the Harvard community that included students, faculty, and congregation members. While some attendees were long-time friends of Gomes, others said they had never been to a service at Memorial Church but were inspired by his legacy as a spiritual and moral leader.
“He was a teacher, mentor, pastor, and friend,” said Epps Fellow Nathaniel P. Katz, who led the ceremony along with Memorial Church Associate Minister Dorothy A. Austin.
The ceremony itself began with a procession of the Harvard University Choir, clad in their red and black choral robes.
Attendees quietly entered the chapel—lit only by the hundreds of small candles in the hands of the mourners— some sharing an occasional hug or tear.
Solemn hymns and prayers were interrupted only by the occasional cough and a baby’s cry. Attendees departed the Church in silence after the ceremony.
The service of compline capped a day of prayer at Memorial Church dedicated to Gomes’ memory. Members of the community filtered in and out of the chapel throughout the day to honor the reverend.
Gomes’ casket was situated at the front of the room where mourners began to line up at 9 a.m. to pay their respects. Next to the casket sat a portrait of Gomes along with large, ornate arrangements of flowers.
Throughout the day, the organ—to which Gomes had dedicated much of his time in recent years to seeing restored—led those paying tribute in a set of somber hymns.
Known for his oratory skills, strong advocacy for equality, sharp insight into the Bible, and magnanimous spirit, Gomes was a long-time fixture on Harvard’s campus. He is largely credited for maintaining a following at Memorial Church while attendance shrunk at other university churches across the country.
Gomes’ death sparked an outpouring of emotion across the Harvard community.
“He was a scholar, a preacher, a teacher, and a public intellectual who brought religion into politics in ways that illumined our thought,” Austin told The Crimson earlier this week.
“No one epitomizes all that is good about Harvard more than Peter J. Gomes,” said Harvard Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates Jr. in a statement.
Austin announced that the University will hold a formal memorial service in Gomes’ honor open to the Harvard community on April 6 at 11 a.m.

Ending a 40-year standoff between Harvard and the military that began with the Vietnam War and culminated in the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” University President Drew G. Faust signed an agreement Friday with Navy Secretary Ray E. Mabus formally recognizing the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps on Harvard’s campus.
“Our renewed relationship affirms the vital role that the members of the armed forces play in serving the nation and securing our freedoms,” Faust said at the signing ceremony Friday.
The agreement to recognize NROTC—which comes on the heels of Congress’ December repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the military policy which banned gays and lesbians from openly serving the military—will go into effect when the policy’s repeal is implemented later this year. The University previously did not recognize ROTC because it said that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” violated its non-discrimination policy.
Speaking before a bank of television cameras and around two dozen Navy sailors and Marines in dress uniform, Faust said that she had “looked forward to this day with anticipation and pride.”
Since the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”, Faust and other University officials have been in discussions with the Pentagon about bringing the program back to campus.
“It underscores the importance that all of us place on opportunity and inclusion—on opening pathways for students to pursue their ambitions, to cultivate their capacity for leadership, to lead lives of value to others,” Faust said.
The University is currently in discussions with the other services about resuming official relations, Faust added.
While Friday’s agreement only grants formal recognition to NROTC, the decision is of significant symbolic importance and represents a drastic departure from the often antagonistic relationship that has existed in the past between elite U.S. universities and the American military.
But tensions remain as some consider Friday’s agreement to be discriminatory.
Outside the signing ceremony in Loeb House, protesters picketed the event in support of gender equality. Some opponents of ROTC’s return to Harvard contend that the move is in violation of the University’s non-discrimination policy given that trans-identified and intersex individuals are not allowed to serve in the military.
With Friday’s agreement, a director of NROTC will be appointed at Harvard, and the University will provide funding for the full cost of students’ participation in the program.
“It is wonderful news. It’s a huge step forward, not just for the military and for Harvard, but for the country,” said Seth W. Moulton ’01, a retired Marine captain. “We shouldn’t have elite institutions removed from those who serve our country.”
The recognition will also allow midshipmen to use Harvard facilities for physical training and to take Harvard transportation to MIT.
Although ROTC will be officially recognized, a unit will not necessarily be established on campus, and Harvard cadets will continue to train at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The University is unlikely to establish a unit at Harvard until there is a sufficient amount of interest among students.
Currently, only 20 students are enrolled in ROTC.
Military budget constraints may prevent the return of other services in the near future, according to Kevin “Kit” Parker, chair of the newly created ROTC implementation committee. Parker is an associate professor at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
The return of ROTC to Harvard is also likely to have spill-over effects to universities who currently do not recognize the program.
Moulton said that he believes that Harvard’s recognition will put pressure on other universities to follow suit. Columbia and Yale have had a similar non-recognition policies toward ROTC, though both universities are said to be in talks with the military.
Kennedy School Professor David R. Gergen said he believes that Harvard’s recognition is “likely to have a ripple effect across the nation.”
But as Faust signed the agreement in the grandeur of historic Loeb House, approximately 25 students, faculty, and queer rights activists protested outside, chanting “Put down your pen!”
Many picketers said that the University’s recognition of ROTC was not only a violation of the non-discrimination policy but also gave the impression that the trans community had been “overlooked.” Several held signs that read “R.I.P. non-discrimination policy.”
“Harvard has a commitment to take its non-discrimination policy seriously,” said Sam J. Bakkila ’11-’12, a Harvard College Queer Students and Allies board member. “One group can’t be ignored. Every member of LGBTQ, including the T, must be considered.”
Currently, the military does not allow trans and intersex individuals to enlist as it considers gender identity disorder—the psychological classification that describes transgenderism—and intersexism to be medical disqualifications. Some opponents of recognizing ROTC contend that this policy is discriminatory.
Though openly gay and lesbian individuals will be able to serve after top government officials certify the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the new policy will not apply to trans and intersex individuals.
“I feel really sad, more than anything else,” said Cameron E. Partridge, a trans-identified lecturer on Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality and at the Divinity School. “I don’t think this is an uncaring decision. This just raises questions about how Harvard intends to uphold its non-discrimination policy.”
In 1969, Harvard expelled ROTC amidst a wave of student and faculty anger over the Vietnam War. Later, the University based its continued split with the military on the basis of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” which Harvard considered in violation of its non-discrimination policy.
In recent years, relations with the military have warmed significantly. Since 2008, Faust has attended the spring ROTC commissioning ceremony, continuing a precedent set by her predecessor, Lawrence H. Summers. During a campus event with Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael G. Mullen in November, Faust made clear that ROTC would be welcomed back when the military changed its policy on gays and lesbians.
Several faculty members at the ceremony acknowledged the protesters’ concerns, noting that they intend to work toward reconciling this issue.
“This day is a very important and significant moment in the history of the College and the University,” said Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. “But there are still a lot of things we have to do to resolve these concerns.”
Faust said that administrators will continue to “dialogue” with these students.
“I view [the protesters] sympathetically. This is a work in progress, but recognizing ROTC is a very important step nonetheless,” said Harvard Divinity School Professor Diana L. Eck, a Lowell House Master who has served on the BLGTQ Task Force.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you can play solid defense on the baseball diamond, then you are dependable. If you can take the mound and hold off the opposing offense on a consistent basis, then you are reliable.
But if your coach can put you wherever he needs, knowing with full confidence that you will give 110 percent no matter where you are on the field, then you are indispensable.
For the Crimson, sophomore Danny Moskovits is indispensable.
“Without a doubt, [Moskovits] is the one guy who’s made the biggest improvement so far,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “We had him in the lineup a little bit last year, and he was swinging the bat really well, but he’s really come on as a player since the end of last season.”
With the arrival of springtime comes sunny days, green grass, and the return of baseball, and Moskovits cannot wait until the season comes into full swing.
“Obviously, I’m really excited,” Moskovits said. “Everyone on the team is really excited, because we have the best team that we’ve had in a long time, especially in these last four years. We should be really good this year.”
Last season as a freshman, Moskovits played in 19 games for the Crimson and started 11 of them. But after the end of the season, he did not stop playing baseball; instead, he went out to improve his game over the summer and is anxious to show off his skills when Harvard takes the field this upcoming season.
“I just got in 50 times better shape—way more explosive,” Moskovits said. “I just grew a lot mentally after freshman year. Freshman year was pretty tough because my approach, especially at the plate, wasn’t where it should have been. So I’m just trying to stay more relaxed this year and having fun playing baseball and just letting my skills take over. It’s been going really well.”
On the field, Moskovits spent most of his time last year playing third base. But with the graduation of Dan Zailskas ’10, Moskovits finds himself on the other corner of the diamond, taking over the responsibilities at first base.
“He’s taken to it like a fish to water,” Walsh said. “He looks really comfortable over there. We have to wait until the games to see, but we feel really good with him at first base.”
Most players stick to one primary position for the majority of their careers, but according to Walsh, one of the things that makes Moskovits such a special player is his versatility.
“I played all over the place in high school,” Moskovits said. “I’m pretty versatile on the field. I played a lot of shortstop in high school, but I actually played a decent amount of first base in my senior year of high school, so it’s not like a brand new thing for me. The transition’s been fun, and it’s been really good for me.”
But Moskovits doesn’t just showcase his talents on the field playing shutdown defense —he is also a pretty talented pitcher.
“Moskovits will get you through about three innings,” Walsh said. “He wants the ball. He’s an 89 mph guy with a slider, and he wants to be out there.”
“If I get the call to go warm up in the bullpen, I just switch mentalities,” Moskovits said. “I’m still going to be in the lineup when I’m pitching so that’s not a problem. But I love pitching. It’s not hard and it’s something that I really embrace. This year, pitching has been going really well, so I’m excited to get on the mound.”
Even with all the talk about his versatility on the field, his offense at the plate is nothing to ignore or shove aside. His flexibility also applies in the batting order, and Walsh is comfortable starting him at any spot one through nine, although he will primarily be a middle-of-the-lineup hitter.
With the change in the type of bats that will be used in college baseball this season to promote more small-ball and less power-hitting, the heart of the lineup will have to focus more on making contact and driving in runs. Moskovits is not worried about this change at all.
“Personally, I haven’t really changed my approach with the new bats,” Moskovits said. “I mean it’s not the same, but you just have to focus. If you were a good hitter with the old bats, you’ll be a good hitter with the new bats.”
With the start of the season just around the corner, Moskovits has embraced his starting role. After seeing limited action in his freshman year, he is ready to play a bigger role for the Crimson as its starting first baseman. He hopes to be a part of the first winning season for Harvard baseball in four years.
“This year should be the start of a winning tradition here,” Moskovits said. “We have all the talent to roll through the Ivy League and get to the NCAA regionals, but at this point, we just got to go outside, get back to basics, and do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the old expression goes, pitching wins championships.
But that wasn’t quite true for Harvard last year. Despite boasting the best team ERA in the Ancient Eight, the Crimson fell to Cornell—number two by the same metric—in a deciding third game of the Ivy League Championship a season ago.
As Harvard focuses on the 2011 season, it looks to its staff as a key element in its search of the team’s first league title since 2007.
And junior Rachel Brown is clearly the anchor of the rotation.
“She’s a true strikeout pitcher. She has that depth of her pitches and she has the quality with her riseball,” Crimson coach Jenny Allard said. “I think she is a go-to pitcher for us—everybody knows that. Everybody’s comfortable with her in that role.”
A year ago, Brown was a statistical powerhouse. The first-team All-Ivy Leaguer had a shot at winning the pitching Triple Crown, with top marks in ERA, strikeouts and wins, falling short in the win category to the Big Red’s Elizabeth Dalrymple, now a senior.
Brown led the league in ERA, strikeouts, shutouts, opponent batting average, and appearances. Her 1.37 ERA bested Dalrymple’s second-ranked 1.80. The Harvard junior’s 233 strikeouts were 21 more than the Cornell starter recorded and 130 more than third-place pitcher Kristie Chin from Brown.
She also pitched two no-hitters in a 10-day period, against Princeton on April 2 and Columbia on April 11. Brown had no walks in either game, but errors in the field kept Brown from notching two perfect games.
Brown succeeds Margaux Black, who graduated Harvard last year, as the veteran of the staff. Black wasn’t quite the powerhouse on the mound that Brown has become, but still finished with a 2.29 ERA working mostly in relief.
“[Black] worked hard at her craft and I think really peaked her senior year,” Allard said. “I think Margaux was someone we could really rely on who could come in and throw strikes…I think that’s definitely something we’re going to have to replace within the staff.”
With Black gone, junior Julia Moore, sophomore Jessica Ferri, and freshman Laura Ricciardone will round out the rotation behind Brown. Harvard will rely on its three other starters over the course of the season. The Crimson often plays four games or more in a weekend, so Brown will need support around her in a schedule that does not allow her to pitch every game.
Moore finished 5-4 with 3.48 ERA last season, but Ferri struggled in her rookie year, finishing 0-9 with a 6.89 ERA in 14 appearances. This year’s rookie, Ricciardone comes in as a highly-touted recruit, going 18-9 as a senior at Pope John Paul II Catholic High School in New Orleans with a 0.50 ERA and 280 strikeouts.
“I think they work really well as a staff,” Allard said. “The pitchers have good rapport—they troubleshoot with each other. If someone’s got a great riseball, they watch each other…They really learn from each other.”
Unlike traditionally structured staffs, pitchers at Harvard play a variety of different roles. Brown worked in relief 10 times in 2010, registering two saves on top of her win total. Every regular pitcher last season started at least five times and worked out of the bullpen at least five times.
“[Allard] likes to have a game plan of a starting pitcher, and then a quick reliever, and then a closing pitcher,” Brown said. “The great thing is that no pitcher of the four of us really is tied down to any of those roles, and we can all fill in where needed.”
When the season opens in Florida this week, classmates Brown and Moore will begin to focus on updating, shifting, and tweaking their repertoires. In a league as small as the Ancient Eight, pitchers’ styles become recognizable after two years.
“I think, especially for Jules and me, we have to redefine ourselves as pitchers, especially in our third year,” Brown said. “A lot of these teams have seen us. More so than just changing pitches physically, it’s changing the mental approach and changing the game plan.”
Even for Brown, this change is a critical one. She had led the Ivies two years in a row in strikeouts, and holds four single-season records for Harvard. She is already third all-time in strikeouts in Crimson history, a record she will likely break this spring.
But pitchers become easier to hit it they are not willing to make adjustments.
“People in the conference have seen [Brown] for two years—they know what to expect,” Allard said. “She has got to be able to reinvent herself in some cases. She’s capable of doing that; she’s up to the challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most baseball players, spring officially begins with the high-pitched “ping” of a ball hitting a graphite or aluminum bat. Yet, players, coaches, and fans alike will have to adjust to a new, duller sound of bat-to-ball contact due to the NCAA’s new bat regulations. Effective Jan. 1, 2011, bats used in NCAA competition will have a different standard, making metal bats behave more like wooden ones.
The new testing system is called the Bat-Ball Coefficient of Restitution, or BBCOR. Unlike the previous Ball Exit Speed Ratio (BESR) standard that measured the exit speed of the ball compared to the incoming ball speed and swing speed, BBCOR measures what the ball and bat do on actual impact. In essence, BBCOR measures the “bounciness” of the ball when it comes into contact with a bat. When a ball hits an aluminum bat, the barrel compresses a small amount, causing the ball to “bounce” back quickly. This is known as the trampoline effect. In order to reduce the significance of the trampoline effect, NCAA regulations prohibit a bat from having a BBCOR coefficient higher than 0.500, which is about the same as a wooden bat.
Keeping a low BBCOR coefficient means a change in the composition of aluminum bats and, more significantly, a reduced “sweet spot” of the bat. New bats will approximately have a three-inch sweet spot as opposed to the previous five inches. Batters will be forced to make more accurate contact with the ball in order to get the same results as they could have gotten with the old bats.
“It’s pretty close to swinging with wood,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “They’ve taken the thump out of the aluminum, and I think that you’re just not going to see the home-run ball in college baseball that you’ve seen in the past.”
Taking the “thump” out of metal bats is exactly what the NCAA is trying to do, hoping that the new bats will increase player safety, specifically for pitchers. With the old bats, balls would come flying at pitchers at an average speed of 93 mph, sometimes reaching up past 100 mph. Pitchers would have little to no time to react to the high-paced balls careening toward them, creating highly dangerous situations. The new bats reduce the exit speed of the ball off of the barrel, giving pitchers and other athletes on the diamond more time to move to protect themselves.
Besides increasing the safety of the players, the substantially smaller sweet spot and lower ball exit speed are also expected to lead to fewer hits, home runs, and scored runs. Batters will need to refine their hitting skills in order to accommodate for the increased difficulty in making contact. Some teams will be forced to change their game plan to adapt to this decrease in offensive power. For example, instead of having a big-hitting mentality, teams may need to hit and run, bunt, or steal bases more often. Defensively, players will need to polish their fielding skills and be ready for more in-field hits as opposed to high fly balls.
On the other hand, the new bats do not pose an offensive problem for everybody. Some teams, like the Crimson, may even receive a slight advantage from the new bats.
“We weren’t a team last year that hit a ton of balls out [of the park],” said junior Jeff Reynolds, who batted a .359 average in the 2010 season. “So I think if anything, it plays into our hands a bit because we’re not going to have to adjust our game as much as other teams.”
With the new aluminum bats being made according to the same BBCOR standard as wooden bats, people are starting to wonder what is stopping colleges from only allowing wooden bats. Although some coaches and players are angry about the new bat standard and its close similarity to that of the wooden ones, not everyone is upset. In fact, some, like Walsh, endorse wooden bats.
“I just want to tape practice someday with only wood bats and balls coming off,” Walsh said, “And you know how they sell the waterfall music and stuff in those Brookstone stores? I just want to get the bats’ wood sound and put it on the headphones.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Power, speed and confidence are just a few of the words used to describe this year’s softball team’s freshmen. As the weather starts to warm, the Harvard softball team will be looking for its freshmen to contribute to what is expected to be a successful season.
Last year, the Crimson fell just short of winning the Ivy League Championship in a single-run loss to Cornell. Harvard looks to make this the year that it takes it all.
The team lost six seniors at the end of last season, but it gained six talented freshmen that appear poised to help the team both offensively and defensively.
According to Harvard coach Jenny Allard, freshmen Jackie Cooley and Shelbi Olson add both depth and speed to an outfield that has already garnered Ivy League recognition.
On the diamond, newcomer Kasey Lange is slotted to get playing time at third base—a spot she earned with her prowess at the plate,  not her glove.
“I feel like Kasey’s swinging her bat well,” Allard said. “We’re going to find a place for her in the lineup.”
Freshman pitcher Laura Ricciardone is poised to join a pitching rotation that already includes juniors Rachel Brown and Julia Moore and sophomore Jessica Ferri. The right-hander may potentially even be pitching to fellow freshman Allison Scott behind the plate.
“Ally is going to probably work herself into starting behind the plate at least 50 percent of the time,” Allard said.
Jessica Perillo, currently out with an injury, will round out the freshman infield when she returns to provide versatility in the middle infield. The hope is that this season, she will learn from senior first-team All-Ivy second basemen Ellen Macadam and junior middle infielder Jane Alexander.
The team’s four preseason games will allow the freshmen to not only just receive playing time but also let them to leave a mark on the field.
“We have a freshman class that was much like Rachel [Brown] and Whitney [Shaw] and Jane [Alexander]. They came in, and they were like, ‘We’re going to make an impact here,’” Allard said.
The upperclassmen on the team were able to get a taste last year of how successful the team could be, but none of them are resting on their laurels—especially thanks to the newcomers.
“The older girls are really pushing the team to challenge themselves this year. We are practicing and training harder than ever before, and even though Cornell lost a few people, we want nothing less than to win the Ivy League [title] for our senior captains,” Cooley said.
Facing a tough preseason schedule and non-conference games against ranked teams, the Crimson will have been tested even before it even reaches Ivy League play.
“It’s good that we have been challenged and are going to be challenged, because the Ivy League is very competitive,” Lange said. “We want to be prepared for when we get to the critical games.”
The freshmen also have the challenge of adjusting to varsity athletics at the Division I level, in which they will face the best of the sport.
“Though we all played on really competitive teams with either high school or travel ball, college softball is just more intense,” Cooley said. “Our team is so focused on improving that the time commitment and practices...are the things that will separate us from our competition.”
The Crimson is growing closer together as the season nears, and its developing chemistry is allowing the team to push itself even more.
“Playing together with these girls is almost like playing with family members. We eat and do stuff outside of softball together, which makes for a better team,” Lange said. “It’s more fun to play with someone you trust and can push you because you know they’re looking out for your best interests.”
Harvard’s first test will come at the hands of Seton Hall when the team takes its skills down south to Boca Raton, Fla., to compete in the Florida Atlantic Invitational Tournament this week. This will also be the first chance for the freshmen to taste collegiate play.
Their first opportunity within the Ivy won’t come for another month, but Allard believes both her team and her freshmen are going to be ready.
“Coach Martin is our recruiting coordinator and is the first pass with a lot of correspondence and evaluations, and I thought she did a great job,” Allard said. “We have one of the best freshman classes we’ve ever had.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every baseball team in the book—from the Yankees to the Mudville nine—has depended on their big hitters for both runs on the scoreboard and energy in the lineup. It’s the slugger who has the potential to change the nature of an inning, a game, or a season.
The Harvard women’s softball team is no exception, looking to a hitter with offensive prowess of her own: Whitney Shaw.
The 6’0” junior has made her mark both on her team and on the Ivy League in the last two seasons, leading the Crimson last year with 42 RBIs, and the conference with 13 home runs. In addition, Shaw set a new school record for the most hit-by-pitches, with 13, and tied the record with the most doubles in a season, with 14.
Beyond her strengths at the plate, the San Francisco native was a unanimous pick to the All-Ivy League first-team and played strong defense at first base.
And having accomplished all of this by her sophomore season, Shaw changed the question from, “what can she do,” to, “what can’t she do,” with one more year of maturity, experience, and training under her belt.
But for Shaw, it’s less about the accolades and more about a simple love of the game.
“Softball has a great dynamic between both team and individual aspects,” she said. “I can focus on my own personal game, but always have that team support to keep me going.”
The slugger happened upon softball at a young age, when it was just one of her many athletic interests.
“My parents just wanted to get me involved in as many things as possible,” Shaw said. “I played soccer, basketball, volleyball, and softball...but as I got older, I had to pick and choose what I wanted to pursue more.”
Fortunately for Harvard, she picked softball.
But as much as she has brought to the Crimson already, Shaw recognizes what her team has given in return.
“[The team] has been a great family to have here,” Shaw said. “Some of my best friends have come out of it...but it’s also been the foundation for learning about college. I’m a big believer that sports can teach you things about life that you’ll never learn in class...and [softball] has allowed me to balance everything out.”
For her teammates and coaches, the feeling is mutual.
“Whitney is definitely a rock on this team,” said fellow junior and pitcher Rachel Brown. “I have 100 percent confidence in her. When I’m pitching, I know she’ll put her best foot forward...and when she comes up to bat, I think she’s going to get a hit every time.”
“She’s a power hitter for us,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard echoed. “She can change the game with one swing...and [on the field], she makes sure that those plays that need to happen, happen.”
Although Shaw can lead her team with her bat and glove, some of her biggest contributions come from her personality and leadership style.
“One of the most amazing things about Whitney...is that she doesn’t take herself too seriously,” Allard commented. “We want her to be vocal and to know our defensive system, but also we want her to keep the team loose and confident. She has a great sense of humor...but also a wisdom and a perspective about her that’s really healthy, so people look for her and trust her a great deal.”
“[Shaw] never shows if she’s struggling,” added Brown. “If you’re feeling nervous, you can turn to her and she can settle you down.”
But despite the powerful duo of Shaw and Brown, the Crimson fell just short of its ultimate goal last year: an Ivy League title. Harvard was able to fight its way to the best-of-three Championship series against Cornell, but suffered a heartbreaking 3-2 loss in the final game.
Shaw hit a game-tying home run to even the game at two, but the Crimson never recovered after a Big Red rally.
Because of her success behind the plate in the last two seasons, Allard and Shaw expect that opposing pitchers may change their strategy, throwing her tougher pitches or fewer strikes, forcing her to hit less.
But neither coach nor player seems worried.
“Pitchers will obviously adjust, but at the same time, we’ve been focusing in practice working on counts and staying aggressive,” Shaw said. “We’re going with the mentality to not give the pitchers enough time to change their style, just attack early... and force them to throw strikes.”
“[Pitchers] know her now and will be tougher... but she’s capable,” Allard added. “She’s been driving the ball pretty hard in practice...and our pitchers have even had a hard time facing her too.”
So, unlike mighty Casey of Mudville, who struck out when his team needed him most, Whitney Shaw looks poised to continue leading Harvard from the plate.
In short, as Brown said: “I feel sorry for the other pitchers.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Standing at 6’5” with 100 strikeouts to his name after just two seasons of college baseball, junior pitcher Brent Suter is the pitcher Ivy League teams least want to face, according to a College Baseball Insider poll. The lefty also received preseason recognition from Ancient Eight coaches as one of the league’s top three starting pitchers.
With Suter on the mound, the Harvard baseball team is in good hands.
“Brent has done so much to take what was already super athletic and build and make himself strong and throw hard and be durable,” senior catcher Cole Arledge said. “[Our pitching staff] plays a lot of games in the summer and they work really hard, so you have to give a lot of credit to the pitchers.”
A sophomore last season, Suter earned first-team All-Ivy accolades as a starting pitcher after recording a perfect 4-0 record in Ivy League games. Suter will likely lead from the mound again this year, as part of a Harvard pitching staff that should be one of, if not the top, staff in the league. His dominant performance last season included 33 strikeouts in 33.0 innings pitched.
Coming off of what Harvard coach Joe Walsh called “an unbelievable summer,” Suter has recently earned the attention of major league scouts.
“I’ve been contacted by some major league teams…[and have been] doing some interviews and calls.” Suter said. “It’s really exciting, but right now I’m just focused on helping the team win.”
Having a player like Suter pitching for Harvard benefits the Crimson greatly, but, because Ivy League baseball teams play up to five games each weekend, one strong pitcher is not enough to establish a dominant presence in the league. Luckily for Harvard, the 2011 Crimson pitching staff is currently the deepest it’s been in several years.
“What I’m most excited about [this season] is having a good core of starting pitchers,” said senior Sean O’Hara, who garnered first-team All-Ivy honors at shortstop last season. “We didn’t have that in the last few years, which is kind of a problem, because we play three or four games in a weekend.”
“We have four, five, six really good pitchers that can give you starts and can beat anybody,” Arledge added. “I think that’s going to be the big difference this year. Hitting, I think we’re similar. Guys are one year older, and we didn’t really lose very much, but pitching is just awesome and, as a catcher, I’m just really excited.”
The lineup of starting pitchers for the Crimson will likely include Suter, senior right-handed pitcher Max Perlman, senior lefty Eric Eadington, and junior right-hander Conner Hulse, veterans all looking to lead defensive efforts for Harvard.
“We’re rolling out a weekend staff that can compete with every team in the Ivy League and in the country,” Suter said. “We think we can keep the team in the game every game by eliminating runs, keeping game at quick tempo, and throwing strikes.”
Perlman, a second-team All-Ivy selection his freshman year, had an impressive junior campaign, including a four-inning shutout of Brown last year, after an elbow injury forced him to the sideline for most of his sophomore season.
“Perlman’s back to where he needs to be just as a dominating pitcher,” Walsh said. “Eadington, he’s a lefty capable of throwing 90. We don’t see many teams in the big leagues that have that. Hulse…has gone from being an 86-87 guy to a 91-92 guy. “
A strong crew of reinforcements, including sophomore right-handers Matt Doyle, Joey Novak, and Danny Moskovits, will likely make a big impact on the mound as well.
“[A successful season] has a lot to do with having solid starting pitchers, but our pitching staff is very deep,” Arledge said. “I don’t think we’re going to ever run out of quality pitchers.”
“We had a scout day in the fall and we had nine guys throwing 88 [mph] and above,” Walsh continued. “We didn’t have Eadington, so it’s really 10. We have some power arms on this team, but it doesn’t mean anything unless you get that breaking ball and those sliders.”
Overall, the Crimson boasts three freshman pitchers and 16 upperclassman arms. And on a Harvard team that has few power hitters and a strong defense, the Crimson’s pitchers will need to take on a big role if the team hopes to make a run at its first Ancient Eight title since 2005.
“Our team goal is first and foremost to win the Ivy League,” Suter said. “We feel not only that we have worked hard enough, but that we have the talent and the drive to do it.”
“As a [pitching] staff, we want to keep a low ball-to-strike ratio, keep runs down, keep hits down,” he said. “But most of all to keep team in the game every single game.”
Though only time will tell if Harvard will win the program’s 20th Ivy championship this year, the pitching staff looks promising to Walsh.
“They’re all capable pitchers,” Walsh said. “Right now, we’re really excited because of the number of arms we have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Modesty has its place, but not on the diamond.
“We’re really, really excited about the season this year,” said Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh. “I’m not going to give you any ‘We’re cautiously optimistic’ or anything. We’re good. We’re good right now.”
After making small improvements over the last few years, Crimson baseball is ready to take down its typically grueling schedule with a high level of performance that the entire program seems enthusiastic about.
“We’ve had a lot of great players since I’ve been here,” senior catcher Cole Arledge said, “but I think this year we have the most total talent...I’m just really excited.”
“We have a lot of confidence, and we know what we have to do,” fellow senior Taylor Helgren echoed. “Maybe that’s the same or different than last year, but it’s going to be a lot of fun.”
Arledge and Helgren are part of the squad’s class of 14 seniors, many of whom have played all four years at Harvard. The prominence of veteran players is a big change in team dynamic coming off of a year when the Crimson had only three seniors.
“I think this year we just have a lot more experience,” said senior catcher and captain Tyler Albright. “It’s a little different team this year, but I think this is going to be a good year for us...There’s a lot more team leadership out on the field.”
Albright has been a key part of that leadership, returning to captain the team for the second year.
“I can’t say enough about Tyler,” Walsh said. “Every pitcher wants to throw to him.  He calls 95 percent of the game, blocks curveballs in the dirt with men on third base, and he’s a clutch guy up at the plate. We’re really lucky to have a kid like that.”
And although Harvard is looking to avoid the injuries that plagued Albright and several others in its lineup last season, the team’s widespread talent this year gives the Crimson depth at many positions. This includes junior catcher Jon Smart and Arledge, who are there to back up Albright behind the plate.
On the mound it’s a similar story. Harvard has an unprecedented number of high-caliber pitchers—including Eric Eadington, Conner Hulse, Max Perlman, and Brent Suter—that many are hoping will allow the team to improve on last year’s 17-26 overall record.
“Starting pitching is key; it’s just the basis of the game,” senior shortstop Sean O’Hara said. “But I think we have the defense and the hitting to keep up, so I’m looking forward to being pretty competitive this year.”
With a slew of skilled hurlers keeping its opponent’s bats at bay, the Crimson’s offense should have a good chance to pick up some wins with experienced hitters and a new batch of quick runners.
O’Hara, Albright, and junior Jeff Reynolds led Harvard batters last season and are likely to post good numbers again along with returning impact-players seniors Sam Franklin and Dillon O’Neill, and junior Marcus Way.
A number of rookies are also working to earn their spot in the lineup, a couple of them boosted by speed that the Crimson’s coach believes can be instrumental in picking up bases in the team’s small-ball offense.
“We have two freshmen that can flat out fly in [Jeff] Hajdin and [Carlton] Bailey. I would love to get their bats in the lineup with [junior J.T.] Tomes making the start,” Walsh said. “I don’t expect us to be a power-hitting team…but I do think we’re going to have nine guys in our lineup that are going to be tough outs.”
Harvard will put its new squad to the test as it heads down to Florida this weekend for a four-game series against Jacksonville St., before heading out on its marathon 11-game Spring Break roadtrip.
“We’re going to have to be a tough ballclub when we play some of these teams down South,” Walsh said. “There are some hard-nosed players on those teams, and we’re going to have to be that way as well.”
“It’s great having this indoor facility, but to go down and play other teams that have been outside all year and have already played eight games kind of puts us at a disadvantage,” Albright added. “But, then again, we’re excited to get outside … and to put up some W’s.”
The Crimson will return to the Northeast to begin conference play in April. Last year, Harvard split every Ivy weekend, and the team can’t stand the thought of a repeat.
“That doesn’t win it for you,” Walsh said of the splits. “When you come back from a weekend 2-2, it’s like kissing your sister.”
Jokes aside, the Crimson faces a tough slate of Ancient Eight opponents.
“There’s so much parity in the Ivy League that any team can compete any year,” Franklin said. “One good thing about that is that you can be optimistic every year, but on the other hand we’re facing great competition every weekend.”
But with both experience and fresh talent on its side, Harvard is poised to make a run for the Ivy title that has eluded it for the past five years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One more win.
That is the theme of the upcoming year for Harvard’s softball team. One more win last year, and the squad would have been Ivy League Champions.
The Crimson will look to rebound from last year’s loss to Cornell in the league finals and step up to take the Ancient Eight crown.
“I think we will focus on using the feelings [of despair] that we felt at the end of the year when Cornell took the championship right out from under us,” junior infielder Whitney Shaw said. “I think we are doing a good job of using [last year’s loss] to turn it around and use it to fuel us.”
Harvard opens its season this weekend in the Florida Atlantic Tournament, the first chance for the team’s six freshmen to see live action. Its next stretch of games is in California from March 11-13 in the UCR Tournament.
“I’m really looking forward to these preseason trips, [especially when we play] Seton Hall and Stonybrook, who are in our region, and playing Michigan State, the preseason favorite.” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “It’s going to be a good comparison for us to go back to Southern California, playing UC Riverside this year and comparing our play this year versus last year...I think that’s going to be a good benchmark.”
For Harvard to reach its preseason goals, it must have strong play from returning players Ellen Macadam—a team co-captain—junior pitcher Rachel Brown, and Shaw.
Macadam commences her senior season looking to continue her solid play of a year ago, when she hit .365 and stole 16 bases. The Crimson will look to Shaw to repeat last year’s performance as well, when the team’s power threat tallied 14 of the Crimson’s 27 home runs and hit .333.
Brown was Harvard’s ace last year, leading the league in most pitching statistics and earning first-team All-League honors.
The Crimson has the potential to win often this year, but it knows that the goal of an Ivy League championship is a long way away, and it will require excellent team play to wrest away Cornell’s league title.
“One thing we are focusing on is attacking every single game, even [if] it’s the preseason,” Shaw said. “We are focusing on every single aspect of our game and not only working on the obvious skills like fielding, hitting, pitching and throwing, but also our mental game.”
In order to stay grounded, the team has set many goals for both the short- and the long-term in order to improve everyday until the playoffs.
“Our team is pretty big on setting goals,” Shaw said. “The main goal is to win the Ivies, and I think we are doing a good job of breaking down and thinking about the steps that it takes to get there...[We’re] working on not striking out; these are definitely things we are working on and building on that will hopefully cultivate [into] our final goal.”
The team will face stiff competition in its quest for an Ivy title, especially from the two-time defending champion Big Red.
“I think the league is just going to be a pure dogfight,” Allard said. “It’s going to be tough. I think we’re anxious to play Cornell again—there’s no question. I think the team has made huge strides against Cornell in the last few years.”
One more reason for optimism is that the Big Red has graduated many of its best players from a year ago.
“They’ll be an interesting team to see how they reshape after losing a pretty phenomenal class,” Allard added. “That class [of 2010] was the reason they won back-to-back titles.”
But for now, the Crimson is concentrating on itself. It knows that there is a lot at stake and is taking it one step at a time to reach its goal.
“We always come out with that fire [to start the season], especially with last year leaving a bitter taste in our mouth,” Shaw said. “Because none of us have experienced [winning a championship], it adds an extra dimension of not only playing for that ultimate goal, [but also] for playing as a team in order to achieve for all of us that experience of winning it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With 15:40 to play in the second period of the ECAC Semifinals, Dartmouth forward Amanda Trunzo took advantage of a 5-on-4 player advantage and snuck a slapshot into the back of the Harvard net—a goal that ended a 1-1 tie and, effectively, the      Crimson’s season.
Unfortunately for Harvard (17-11-4, 14-6-3 ECAC), this was a lead the No. 9 Big Green (22-10-0, 16-7-0) would not relinquish.
Dartmouth went on to score two more second-period goals on the way to a 4-1 win over the Crimson at Bright Hockey center last night.
“They were one step ahead of us,” Harvard coach Katy Stone said. “They thought faster and they were grittier.”
The Big Green was the first team to light up the scoreboard, as a scramble around the Crimson net allowed Trunzo to put the puck behind sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy with just over eight minutes to play in the first frame.
But with 3:23 to play in the same period, sophomore Josephine Pucci answered for Harvard with a goal of her own.
After a long Crimson possession, tri-captain Leanna Coskren sent the puck to the sophomore, who smacked a quick shot from just inside the blue line at the Dartmouth goal. The puck deflected off of Big Green goaltender Lindsay Holdcroft and rolled into the net to tie up the score.
“No one wants to go down by any [number of] goals,” Coskren said. “For [Pucci] to score, that was huge for us to get a little momentum. She has a great one-timer. I knew when I had the puck, if I got it over to her she was going to get a great shot off. That’s been her sweet spot this season.”
“It’s kind of exactly what you hope for: a quick shot, straight at the net, and the puck goes in,” Stone added. “We would have liked to have a little more of that in the [final] two periods.”
The second period was all Dartmouth, as the Big Green scored three goals in just over seven minutes.
Dartmouth forward Camille Dumais netted the final goal of the game at 10:56 in the middle frame, giving the Big Green a comfortable three-goal advantage.
“When you go down three goals, you dig a hole for yourself,” Stone said. “We’ve been good at coming back … We have a lot of firepower, a lot of speed and we put a lot of pressure on [Dartmouth], but they were able to withstand it.”
Despite a big third period effort in which Harvard outshot the Big Green, 17-5, Dartmouth held onto its lead to end the Crimson’s season and ECAC tournament run.
“[Coming into] the third, we knew we were in a do-or-die situation,” Coskren said. “We’ve unfortunately been in these situations a lot of times before—down by a couple of goals going into the third period—and in those games we have come back.”
“We didn’t count ourselves out, [and it’s] important to make sure we never do that,” she continued. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t win it tonight, but our effort was definitely there.”
Holdcroft had 32 saves on the night to help the Big Green extend its season. Bellamy had a strong game between the pipes as well, recording 23 saves for Harvard.
Senior forward Katharine Chute won 15 faceoffs in last night’s game, more than any other player on either team.
“We came on strong in the third period and did a lot of good things, but we never had the kind of chances we wanted to have,” Stone said. “My hat’s off to them and the pressure they put on us. They shut down our speed, and the goaltender made the saves she needed to make.”
The Crimson won both games against Dartmouth in the regular season, by scores of 5-3 and 3-2, but it is the Big Green that will advance to the ECAC Finals next weekend in the hopes of earning a berth in the NCAA tournament.
Dartmouth will take on No. 2 Cornell, which defeated Quinnipiac, 4-3, in last night’s other ECAC semifinal matchup.
“It’s unfortunate, because we’ve had a tremendous second half of the season to put ourselves in this position,” Stone said. “I’ve been so proud of the kids to get to this point, and it’s disappointing to be a little flat tonight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Harvard men’s hockey team prepares for its first-round ECAC playoff series with Clarkson this weekend,  it finds itself surging at just the right time.
After starting the year 4-18-1, the Crimson has won five of its last six contests, including a sweep of the Golden Knights and St. Lawrence last weekend.
The streak pushed Harvard (7-14-1, 9-19-1 ECAC) past the Saints and into tenth place in the ECAC standings.  That set up a matchup at seventh-seeded Clarkson (9-12-1, 15-17-2), which has gone in the opposite direction recently, losing four of its past six games.  The series begins tonight at 7 p.m. at Cheel Arena, and will be followed by contests at 7 p.m. tomorrow night and 4 p.m. Sunday, if necessary.
“Probably a month ago, we really made a decision as a team and as a group not to dwell on what our record was at the time, but really concentrate on …playing our best hockey coming into the playoffs,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “That’s where we’re headed, and now we have to do it consistently.”
The teams split the season series this season, with the Golden Knights prevailing 3-1 in Potsdam on November 13 and the Crimson winning by the same score last Friday evening in Cambridge. Sophomore forwards Marshall Everson and Alex Fallstrom and junior forward Alex Killorn all scored for Harvard in that contest.
“We have to stick with what we’ve been doing,” senior forward Matt McCollem said. “We’ve definitely been taking steps in the right direction, and we’re on a pretty good streak now.”
But the Crimson knows it cannot focus on prior results as it prepares for its best-of-three series.
“I don’t think beating them last weekend is going to have any say over what our attitude is going to be [this weekend],” McCollem said.
To emerge victorious, Harvard will need to contain a Clarkson offense that ranked seventh in the ECAC with a 2.74 goals per game average.
Senior forward Brian DeFazio led the Golden Knights with 13 scores and 24 points during the regular season.  Junior Jake Morley had seven goals and a team-high 15 assists, while forwards Nick Tremblay and Allan McPherson were tied for the team lead with 21 points.
Trying to stop that offense between the pipes will likely be senior Ryan Carroll, who is 5-0 in his last five starts.
“I think establishing a good forecheck, and getting shots on net, are a few key things we need to do,” McCollem said.
The Clarkson offense had a lot of trouble scoring on man-up opportunities during the regular season, as the squad’s 12.2 percent power-play percentage ranked dead last in the conference.  But that may not be a problem for the Golden Knights, as the Crimson defense faced an NCAA-low 111 power-plays during the regular season.
While Clarkson was not successful playing man-up during the year, the team was used to playing man-down. The Golden Knights’ 615 penalty minutes in 2011 were significantly more than any other team in the conference.
In net for Clarkson will be junior Paul Karpowich, who led the ECAC in saves by a wide margin during the regular season, but finished just tenth in the conference with a .910 save percentage.
Attacking Karpowich will be a Harvard offense that has averaged 3.29 goals per game in its last seven contests.  Junior forward Alex Killorn led the squad with 13 scores during the regular season. Sophomore defenseman Danny Biega–named to the All-Ivy League First Team yesterday–paced the team with 25 points on 15 assists and ten goals.  Senior brother Michael Biega finished with eight scores and 13 assists.
The Crimson offense has been extremely balanced of late, with eight different players scoring the team’s nine goals last weekend. The squad’s 23 scores over its past seven contests equaled its total number of goals from its first 17 games.
“We have really come together as a team,” Fallstrom said. “We’ve been facing a lot of adversity, and it’s really made us stronger. And we really found a game plan now, and we have our power-play going, and our penalty kill is really strong, so we’re really starting to put the pieces together.”
In addition to a birth in the ECAC Quarterfinals, a major milestone is at stake for the Crimson as well this weekend.  With a series victory, Harvard will reach 1,300 hundred wins in program history.
The Crimson has won three of its last four ECAC first-round series, including a sweep at Princeton last year.  The Golden Knights hold a 50-46-11 all-time record against Harvard in a rivalry that dates back to 1935, and the teams are tied in the playoffs at 9-9-1.
But for now, the Crimson isn’t paying any attention to history.
“All we’re thinking about is playing [tonight], and we’ll take it from there,” McCollem said. “We’re going to come in prepared and do what it takes to win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hide your kids. Hide your wife. And hide your husband, because the Ivy League is getting fratricidal this weekend. Judgment Week has come for the Ancient Eight.
Three teams—three-and-a-half if you count Dartmouth—have a shot at killing the dreams of a title hopeful. Penn has a crack at Harvard tonight and Princeton next Tuesday, and the Tigers and the Crimson throw down tomorrow evening, likely for the top spot in the conference (the Big Green also has a statistically insignificant chance at beating Princeton tonight).
Without getting too technical, Harvard must pick up a half-game in the standings to catch the Tigers. A sweep this weekend would ensure that outcome and force, at the very least, a neutral-site playoff to determine the Ivy’s Tourney team. Any Crimson loss, however, would necessitate help from Dartmouth (yikes) and/or the Quakers to keep Harvard’s banner dreams alive.
In the simplest terms, both Princeton and the Crimson control their own destinies. If either team wins out (including a potential playoff), that squad will join the Madness.
So while its 70-69 loss to Yale last Saturday was crushing, Harvard is still very much alive. If, at the beginning of the season, the basketball gods had offered me this situation—two, potentially three, straight wins to end the season would earn a ticket to the Dance—I would have taken it in a heartbeat. In that sense, the Crimson is right where it needs to be, playing at home, no less, where it has won 15 in a row.
But make no mistake; the pressure is on. Tonight is the latest “biggest game in Harvard men’s basketball history.” Then it will quickly be supplanted by tomorrow’s game against Princeton.
Win or lose, Lavietes will be a glass case of emotion this weekend. Personally, I’m all-in on this team. This is my last tour Around the Ivies, and to come so close and fall short of history would be devastating. It’s the burden of being a fan. You follow a team through its ups and downs, and then one day you realize that your heart is on the line.
When that day comes, you’re rooting for more than just the game. You’re rooting for all your loyalty to pay off, for a sign that the universe still rewards faith, care, and hope. That’s why the student section doesn’t just chant, “We will win.” The chorus that’s become so familiar to Lavietes starts with one person saying, “I…I believe…”
Belief alone won’t hang a banner, but I do believe that we’ll win out.
PENN (12-13, 6-5 Ivy) at HARVARD (21-5, 10-2 Ivy)
Poor Penn has the toughest conclusion to its season, with games against the Crimson and the Tigers still left on its slate. The flip side of that scheduling is that the Quakers are still relevant. Sure, this class of Penn seniors is the first since the early 1990s to not win a league title, but at least it can spoil the dreams of either Harvard or Princeton.
The first matchup between these two teams was one of the most electric sporting events I’ve ever been to. The Crimson actually won the game three times—once at the end of regulation when the referees inexplicably waved off a foul, once at the end of the first overtime when the buzzer sounded before Zack Rosen’s game-tying shot, and finally for real at the end of the second extra period. I think Harvard will beat Penn for the fourth time this season to set the stage for a showdown with the Tigers.
Pick: Harvard 74, Penn 66
PRINCETON (22-5, 10-1 Ivy) at DARTMOUTH (5-21, 1-11 Ivy)
I hate having Dartmouth as a travel partner. To be fair, last Saturday was the first time all season that the Crimson lost while playing the same team a night after the Big Green did, but situations like tonight make me wish that a stronger squad was batting ahead of us in the lineup.
Opposing teams just don’t have to worry about Dartmouth. Friday games versus the Big Green are just foreplay to Saturday night against Harvard. I expect Princeton will be ready for the Crimson tomorrow.
Pick: Princeton 70, Dartmouth 57
YALE (14-12, 7-5 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (14-12, 5-7 Ivy)
With two games left, it’s time to kick off the Ivy League Player of the Year discussion. It has to start with Bulldogs big man Greg Mangano, right? He’s arguably the best scorer in the conference and definitely the best rebounder and shot blocker. While the Bulldogs won’t finish in the top tier of the league, I don’t think a single player has done more for his team.
A strong finish to the season would do wonders for his candidacy. I think Yale continues its winning streak over Columbia in New York.
Pick: Yale 70, Columbia 68
BROWN (11-15, 4-8 Ivy) at CORNELL (8-18, 4-8 Ivy)
Brown had Harvard on the ropes last weekend until sophomore Andrew McCarthy missed a wide-open layup that would have tied the game with just over three minutes left. Had the end of that contest played out differently, the Bears would be riding the longest winning streak in the league.
I like the way this team is coming together. Tucker Halpern, Sean McGonagill, and company should be able to climb up the Ivy ranks next year, with the squads ahead of them losing seniors from their core. In the meantime, I see Brown picking up its second conference road win.
Pick: Brown 76, Cornell 75
PENN at DARTMOUTH
Aside from Princeton-Harvard, none of the Saturday games will even register on the college basketball Richter scale. If the Quakers beat Dartmouth and nobody is paying any attention, does it still count?
Pick: Penn 69, Dartmouth 58
BROWN at COLUMBIA
By tonight, Columbia will have played the top four teams in the league in succession. Brutal. The Lions are another team that will be on the rise next year, so this Columbia-Brown matchup will be a lot more interesting in 12 months. Tomorrow’s game, however, will be merely a footnote in the 2010-11 Ivy season. I like the Lions at home.
Pick: Columbia 77, Brown 72
YALE at CORNELL
Yale stole one from Cornell back on Feb. 4 when the Bulldogs erased a 10-point deficit with less than two minutes remaining to pull out a 71-70 victory. I think the Big Red enact a measure of revenge and end Yale’s season on a sour note.
Pick: Cornell 71, Yale 69
PRINCETON at HARVARD
Now that Charlie Sheen has told us the secret to winning is tiger blood, I understand Princeton’s success. But, like Sheen, I don’t think the Tigers can keep this up forever. I keep waiting for a spectacular fallout. So far, it’s been a steady climb of excellence for both Princeton and Sheen—I’m not even sure where the peak is anymore—but this has to end horribly, right? Tell me yes, because I don’t want to live in that other world.
I said it already, but I think Harvard has a championship pedigree. I saw it against Colorado, Boston College, George Washington, and Brown, and I think we’ll see it again tonight.
Pick: Harvard 70, Princeton 65
PRINCETON at PENN
The final kink in the Ivy schedule is this quirky game next Tuesday night between the Tigers and Penn. Given a Princeton loss tomorrow, I hope the Quakers win so that I don’t have to rebook my flight for Spring Break in order to cover a playoff game. I don’t think I’m that lucky though.
Pick: Princeton 65, Penn 61
RECORD LAST WEEK: 6-2 (To date: 30-11)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s time for the Weekend Preview! After two weeks off from previewing all of the weekend matches, I’m excited to be back…and it could not be a more action-packed weekend to welcome my return. Just as the parents are arriving for Junior Parents Weekend, multiple athletic teams are gearing up for one of the busiest weekend in a while.
All eyes will be on the men’s basketball team as it battles for a spot in the NCAA Tournament against Penn and Princeton this week. Going into last weekend, Harvard was the frontrunner to take first place in the Ivy League, but lost a critical matchup against the Bulldogs, 70-69, allowing Princeton to slide into first place. The Crimson will look to keep its title hopes alive in two of the biggest home matches in Crimson history: the first game against Penn tonight at 7 p.m. and the second against Princeton tomorrow night at the same time. Harvard holds a 21-5 (10-2 Ivy) record, but Princeton possesses a slight advantage with a 22-5 (10-1 Ivy) record.
The results from the women’s basketball squad’s away matchups versus Penn and Princeton are just as important, as the team clings onto the slight possibility of earning a berth to the postseason. The squad holds an 8-3 conference record, but can equal the past two season’s Ivy records of 11-3 by winning its last three games on the road. Harvard faces off against Penn tonight at 7 p.m. and against Princeton tomorrow night at 6 p.m. Last season, the Crimson beat the Quakers 55-52, but fell to the Tigers, 78-66.
The men’s swimming and diving team also has an important weekend at the Ivy League championships at home and will square off against one of its toughest competitors, Princeton. For the past two years, Harvard has dominated all of the other Ivy squads except the Tigers, but the Crimson finally pulled out a 189-164 victory at the annual HYP meet this year. The Ivy championships started yesterday, but action continues today and tomorrow. In the past three years, the Tigers hold more wins over the Crimson, but Harvard now has the confidence that it can reverse that trend.
The men’s hockey team heads to Clarkson for the first round of the ECAC Tournament. The season has been less than favorable; the men currently hold a 9-19-1 record, but the squad has turned the season around and has won five of its last six matches. The No. 10 seed will face off against No. 7 seed Clarkson in a best-of-three matchup to determine who will move forward in the tournament. Last year, the Crimson made it to the quarterfinals but lost to Cornell, the eventual champions.
The men’s tennis team travels to Ball State and Louisville for its first road trip of the spring season. The Crimson maintains a 5-5 record for the season but lost its last two matches to Cornell and Princeton in the ECAC Division I Indoor Team Championships. Tomorrow, Harvard takes on Ball State and will face off against Louisville the next day. Harvard has only met both teams once, winning its matchup in 1994 against Ball State, 5-2, but dropping its matchup to Louisville in 2005, 4-3.
The men’s volleyball team also has two matches this weekend against Juniata tonight and Princeton tomorrow afternoon. Compared to last season’s start of nine losses, the squad is faring much better this year. After seven games, Harvard held a 6-1 record, but has dropped three straight, including a three-set loss to Juniata. The last time the Crimson faced the Tigers resulted in another straight-sets defeat.
The baseball team’s season is just getting underway this weekend with four games against Jacksonville State. The first takes place this afternoon at 3 p.m. and the men wrap up the quadruple-gamer on the road on Sunday at noon. Last season, the men finished with a 17-26 record and looks to improve upon that this year. The last time the Crimson faced off against Jacksonville was in 2009, resulting in one win and three losses.
The softball team also begins its season on the road against five teams this weekend at the Florida Atlantic Tournament. Last year, the women posted a winning record (27-23) and were a game away from winning the Ivy crown. The squad first takes on Seton Hall today at 11 a.m. and finishes up the weekend against Providence on Sunday at 9 a.m.
The men’s and women’s lacrosse teams are also at the beginnings of their season. The men started off the season on the right foot against Canisius with a 9-7 win and will try to carry this momentum forward against Hofstra tomorrow at 1 p.m. Hofstra has beaten Harvard in its last two encounters. On the other hand, the women’s lacrosse team dropped its first match of the season against Stanford last weekend. The women will try to even their record against Cornell tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m. Harvard has won the last two meetings between the teams, but Cornell holds the overall advantage, winning 10 of the last 12 matchups.
Finally, some teams are traveling to some big tournaments to round out their seasons. The track and field team heads to the ECAC Championships starting tomorrow and continuing into Sunday. The wrestling squad heads to Lewisburg, Pa. for the EIWA Championships this weekend. The men and women’s squash teams travel to Hanover, N.H. to compete in the CSA Individual Championships. Finally, the sailing team will be nearby at MIT for the Sharpe Trophy Team Race tomorrow morning.

If you see an unusually large number of eager adults following harried students around campus this weekend, don't be alarmed—it's just Junior Parents Weekend.
You can find a complete list of the special events here, but we've compiled some of the best of them to get you started on your PG plans for the weekend.
Friday, March 4
8:45 a.m. to 4 p.m.—Have your parents stop by the reception desk in the Cambridge Queen's Head Pub. They'll need those buttons.
 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m.—Parents pestering you about getting a job or hitting the books? Take them to the open houses held during parts of the day at the Office of Career Services or the Bureau of Study Council, or distract them with a tour of a museum, the Women's Center, the Harvard Foundation, or even UHS. You might at least be able to score some free candy at a few of these spots.
10 a.m. to 12 p.m.—Take a tour of Widener Library. "Hey, Mom! Look at this amazing library where I could study. Instead, I go to Lamont Café!"
3 p.m.—Pack into Sanders Theatre for a welcome address by University President Drew G. Faust and speeches by a panel of Harvard seniors. Stay afterward for a cappella performances. 
5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.—Check out the reception at your House. Meet your blockmates' parents.
8 p.m.—Catch "Kashmir If You Can," the Hasty Pudding Theatricals' annual dragstravaganza, at the New College Theatre. As tickets are pricey ($38), Parents Weekend is the right time to go. The show also runs on Saturday at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 8 p.m.

2 p.m. and 7 p.m.—Let your parents show off all that Harvard gear they just bought in the appropriate arena: cheer on the men's volleyball team as it faces Princeton at the MAC in the afternoon, or support the men's basketball team in their match against the Tigers at Lavietes Pavilion at night.

Want to hear about progressive causes on campus? Looking for a new way to publicize your activism-related organization's events?
Subscribe to the new Harvard Activist List, an e-mail listserv for sharing information about campaigns, rallies, and progressive events on campus,
Moderator Sandra Y.L. Korn '14 defined activists as "people advocating their causes and trying to change policy and get legislations passed."
After talking to leaders of several activist groups last semester, Korn decided to create a unified group in order to consolidate activism-related announcements.
To prevent spam, the listserv will enforce several rules, such as limiting subscribers to sending no more than two posts about the same event and requiring that all posts include the name of the organization behind them.
Over 100 students have signed up for the list.
The Activist List is active—the listserv has already seen e-mails about a rally tomorrow protesting the return of ROTC to Harvard, a teach-in on universal health care, Tuesday's "Feminist Coming Out Day" events, and more.

CS50 is an undergraduate class whose final projects dramatically impact Harvard student life. Although students produce most CS50 projects, course instructor David J. Malan '99 regularly contributes projects of his own design that benefit Harvard students, including HarvardCourses, Shuttleboy, and, most recently, HarvardEnergy.
HarvardEnergy, a part of the Resource Efficiency Program, was inpired by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith who asked Malan to "help students better understand and visualize our usage of energy on campus."
In addition to offering information on each House's energy and water consumption, the website also features a "Green Cup" metric, which compares each House's total energy consumption and carbon footprint. This measurement is "one of the determining factors" in the Green Cup, the annual inter-House competition that ranks Houses according to how much they've reduced their energy consumption over the past year.
"The overarching goal of the site, really, is awareness. Even if a student spends just seconds on the site playing around, the hope is, next time they exit a room, it'll occur to them with higher probability to switch off the lights on their way out," said Malan, in an e-mailed statement.
While most of the information on the website comes from pre-existing sources, Malan's goal was simply to make the data more accessible and fun to explore.
"If we, as a campus, can indeed reduce our overall consumption of energy this year, then the site will indeed have been worth everyone's effort," he said.

Housing day is now less than a week away, and Pfoho continues to release funny videos. In "Pfoho is Too Damn Pfly," the House satirizes the notorious Jimmy McMillan of the 2010 New York gubernatorial debates. In "Pfabuloso," Pfoho parodies a Kahlúa commercial to show how living in Pfoho makes everything more "intriguing."
