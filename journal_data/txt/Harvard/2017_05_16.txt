After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A committee tasked with potentially revising the College's policy penalizing membership in final clubs and Greek organizations will share preliminary recommendations with the Faculty “in the coming weeks,” according to a letter from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith.
According to Smith’s letter to Faculty sent Monday, the committee will also create and share an online forum for Harvard faculty members to post feedback on the committee’s recommendations after they are disseminated.
"A wiki page will be created to provide the Faculty with an online forum for feedback and engaged dialogue about the policy and the work of the committee,” Smith wrote in the letter.Formed in January and composed of faculty, staff, and students, the review committee is currently assessing a policy which starting in 2021 will bar members of single-gender social organizations from holding club leadership positions and athletic team captaincies as well as receiving many post-graduate fellowships. According to Smith, the committee “will plan for a number of substantive discussions” on its recommendations in the fall, though the policy will have already taken effect for incoming freshmen by that time.Months of contentious faculty debate provided the impetus for the committee. Last year, some faculty members charged administrators with skirting Faculty governance, saying they had not been adequately consulted in the formation of the policy. In an interview last year, Smith called these accusations “categorically false.” Following the creation of the committee, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 withdrew a motion aimed at blocking the sanctions against single-gender groups. Still, he said that if the committee produces recommendations he deems to be “without adequate revision,” he will reintroduce his motion.
Some faculty members have expressed concern that Khurana—the policy’s original architect—serves as a co-chair for the committee. During a Faculty meeting in March, Smith responded to these criticisms by saying that it did not make sense to restart conversation on the policy without conferring with Khurana on the matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a reversal of longstanding support for co-ed membership, undergraduate members of the Fox Club voted against allowing women to be elected into the final club this fall in a non-binding vote, according to internal emails obtained by The Crimson.
The May 1 vote marks a stark about-face for the club’s undergraduate membership, who unilaterally added nine women to the club in October 2015. That move drew the ire of some graduate members, plunging the Fox into an almost year-long internal dispute. In an August 2016 internal survey, 83 percent of polled undergraduate members said they supported opening the club to women.
Fox graduate board president Hugh M. Nesbit ’77, undergraduate president Alexander M. Fisher ’18, and more than two dozen members of the Fox did not respond to or declined requests for comment on the vote.
This spring’s undergraduate vote comes just months before a College policy slated to penalize membership in single-gender social organizations will go into effect.
Before the announcement of the College’s social group penalties, more than 80 percent of the club’s undergraduate membership voted in favor of going co-ed, according to a letter sent by the undergraduate leaders of the club to graduate members in October 2015.
The letter also stated that, although pressure to go gender neutral from Harvard had “forced [their] hand,” Fox undergraduates had wanted to add women to the club for some time.
The move pitted the club’s undergraduates against their alumni, however, as the graduate board—just weeks after the undergraduates’ decision—briefly shuttered the organization’s clubhouse on JFK Street and assigned new members a provisional status amidst concerns about the decision.
In August 2016, a motion to open the club to women narrowly failed to reach the two-thirds majority among graduate members it needed to pass, effectively reversing the undergraduates’ decision—though the elected women are set to retain provisional status until later this year. This year, the Fox’s newly-elected class was all-male.
