The prestigious Hoopes prize for outstanding research or scholarly work was awarded last week to 83 undergraduates for their theses or projects.
The prize—funded by the estate of Thomas T. Hoopes ’19 and administered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Prize Office—comes with a rigorous application process, requiring nomination from a faculty member and review by a prize committee.
At the end of the process, winners receive an award, which totalled $3,500 for students and $1,000 for the winners’ faculty advisers last year. Hoopes Prize recipients Evan B. Kornbluh ’09 and Matthew M. Spellberg ’09 said that they were not told how much the prizes would pay this year.
After spending the past summer in Mexico City digging through government archives, Kornbluh wrote his thesis about the government’s reaction to Chinese political factions in Mexico during 1911—the year of the Chinese Revolution.
Spellberg, a joint English and Romance Languages and Literatures concentrator, submitted his senior thesis entitled “Art and Dream in Marcel Proust,” which explores the theme of dreaming in Proust’s novels, a topic he said has fascinated him for years.
“While reading Proust, a lot of the things I was thinking about crystallized into something that became more concrete, and I realized I wanted to write about these topics using Proust as a template,” he said.
Hoopes Prize winner Megan L. Srinivas ’09, a Human Evolutionary Biology concentrator, spent this past summer in Peru and wrote her winning thesis on the evolution of malaria’s ability to resist treatment.
But though she conducted her research in Peru, Srinivas said she doesn’t plan on spending her award money in the Americas. Rather, she’ll be backpacking with friends in a different part of the world—Europe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate student leaders met Friday to discuss a joint reaction to the sweeping budget cuts announced last Monday by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. The group agreed on a three-phase protest dubbed “We Are Harvard: Students, Staff, and Faculty for Transparency and Inclusion in Budget Cuts,” which will take place before, during, and after the monthly Faculty meeting this Tuesday.The administration is “still not being transparent,” said Andrea R. Flores ’10, Undergraduate Council president, at the meeting. Other than Flores, Institute of Politics President Mary K.B. Cox ’10, Harvard College Democrats Presidents Eva Z. Lam ’10, several UC members, and numerous House Committee chairs were in attendance. In an e-mail to The Crimson, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote that he did not understand the logic behind the protest, as the “open dialogue” students are calling for is already happening.“We are openly and actively informing the community of the actions we’ve planned,” he wrote.The protest will begin with student group leaders—and possibly faculty or staff—handing out materials before the meeting starts. Then students who serve on student-faculty committees, and are therefore allowed to attend the meeting, will pose questions to the Faculty about budget cuts, according to the plan.At 5:15 p.m. the group plans to hold a larger rally outside University Hall, where the Faculty meeting will be in progress. During the meeting, several students discussed methods to increase press coverage of the event to put more pressure on administrators. “There are mainstream media outlets that care about this,” said UC representative Eric N. Hysen ’11, “Now I think that’s something we can leverage.”“The best thing we can do is bring together students, staff, faculty, and alumni. If we can bring together all those forces, they will listen,” he said. Several students in attendance seemed optimistic that members of the Faculty would take their side in the struggle to give student voice more sway in College budget decisions. In an e-mail sent to the student body, Flores wrote that the budgetary decisions—to reduce shuttle service, close the Quad library, cut hot breakfast, increase section sizes, and slash House budgets—were the result of a “top-down” approach without input from those affected by them.“Broad community input would have alerted the administration to the serious issues that have been raised by many of these cuts,” she wrote. “Going forward, we are concerned that this pattern will continue as future cuts are announced over the summer and into the fall, when student input will be even more limited than during these first round of cuts.” A Facebook event listed as being hosted by “Harvard Students, Faculty, and Staff” has been created for the rally. HoCo chairs said they also plan to ask their House Masters to take part. Flores, who said she had initially expected “primarily administrative cuts” to be announced last Monday, said before the meeting that the strong student reaction to the budget cuts is being met with little response from administrators. “[Students] are realizing that no matter how many petitions they’re doing or e-mails they write... they’re not getting any sort of response,” she said. “Even though we’re the consumers of the education, we’re not able to give feedback.” In his e-mail to The Crimson on which Flores and UC Vice President Kia McLeod ’10 were copied, Smith pointed to the town hall meetings, a web portal detailing the planned cuts, and group discussions administrators have held with students as examples of the administration’s effort to solicit student opinion.“All of this seems to me to be very much in the spirit of the ‘open dialog’ the students say they are seeking,” he wrote. Smith also wrote that students are involved in the working groups that have been established to address the looming deficit of $220 million—only $77 million of which would be addressed by the cuts announced last week. The May 11 budget cuts were announced before the College’s budget working groups had the their first meeting.—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

Flames engulfed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints off Brattle Street yesterday morning, evicting at least 500 people and reducing the building to a skeleton of walls, a dusty steeple, and a chasm of seared wood.Churchgoers safely evacuated after a fire erupted in the attic of the church, which was built in the mid-1950s. The fire eventually collapsed into the interior of the building, issuing plumes of smoke that could be seen from Harvard Square.“I was baptized here, met my husband here, and had his funeral here,” said service attendant Ruby I. Von Dwornick, her voice breaking as she stood before the remaining walls of the church. “It was heartbreaking to see it be destroyed.”Fire departments from nearby towns joined the Cambridge Fire Department to fight the flames, which were quelled sometime after noon. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but church members posited faulty wiring, antiquated electrical systems, and even lightning strikes as possibilities.A structural engineer will inspect the church’s remains today to determine whether the building can be rebuilt or should be destroyed, according to Brad R. MacDonald, assistant to the president of the Cambridge stake, or administrative unit of the Mormon church. Ultimately, the church will likely rebuild in the same location, a process that could take at least a year and a half, MacDonald said.Mormons from across Cambridge were gathered yesterday at the Cambridge church—one of the first Mormon churches established in Mass.—for a special service broadcast live from Salt Lake City. But at 10:37 a.m., shortly into the second sermon, fire alarms began to ring.Attendants evacuated the chapel within minutes, though most did not take the alarm very seriously, according to congregation member Sean L. Little, who said he did not smell any smoke in the chapel at the time.“We just thought someone pulled the alarm,” Little said. “But as we filed out of the doors, we saw the smoke coming out of the roof and realized it was real.”Once outside, Dwornick said she noticed a gradually spreading “ball of flame creeping out from underneath the roof.” She said a firefighter eventually sawed a hole in the roof of the chapel, instigating an explosion of flame that travelled a third of the way up the steeple and engulfed the chapel in which she had been moments before.“This is my home church, as far as I’m concerned,” Dwornick said. “I’m very grateful I got to attend church here the last day it stood.”“It’s a very sad day,” said Gordon K. Low, president of the Cambridge stake, as he stood on the lawn in front of the smoldering building. “There are thousands of members of the church in New England whose experiences are here in this building.”As firefighters continued to pour water into the charred interior of the church late yesterday afternoon to prevent possible flare-ups, church members lingered outside the building to share hugs and distribute bags of chips.“It’s a big, robust church community here,” Low said. “We’ll rebuild and get this back to the point where we’re operating efficiently as a chapel.”In an effort to salvage historical books left inside the destroyed church, some congregation members formed an assembly line to pass down books that survived the flames. A neighboring Quaker church and the repository at the Harvard Divinity School have offered to hold the items until the church finds a space of its own, MacDonald said.Low expressed his gratitude to the multiple congregations for their gestures of consolation and aid. Members of the destroyed church will likely disperse to different Mormon churches in the area in future weeks.But leaders of the church are confident that the destruction of the building is only a physical loss.“It’s certainly devastating but I think the church is always prepared to rebuild and continue its mission,” MacDonald said. “We can always rebuild if we want to—in a metaphorical sense.”—Staff writer Esther I.

Students across campus—generally stunned to hear of the extent of the budget cuts announced last Monday—aired their concerns over Harvard’s numerous e-mail lists, drafted petitions, and organized meetings to protest the planned reductions last week.Whether with talk of the loss of hot breakfast, the reduced shuttle schedule, or the loss of library services at Hilles, House lists exploded last Monday and in the days that followed with student frustration over the cutbacks.“I’m just confused about what happened to the age-old conventional wisdom: Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Suffice to say, I’m disappointed. :-(,” wrote Cassandra B. Snow ’10 on Kirkland-list last Monday.While threads about the loss of hot breakfast certainly proliferated on House lists, many seemed to take the loss of late night shuttle rides to the Radcliffe Quadrangle most seriously.In a 1,033 word e-mail addressed to “The Harvard Community” and forwarded to numerous lists, Quad residents Logan R. Ury ’10 and Tessa K. Lyons-Laing ’11 wrote that cutting late night shuttles puts students in danger.“[T]he cost of keeping Harvard students safe is never ‘unnecessary spending,’” they wrote. “To suggest that we stop whining and start walking is fine during daylight hours (and in warm months). But we constantly receive Community Advisories which alert us to the rising rates of violent crime against both men and women in the area.”Ury is a former Crimson associate magazine editor.George J.J. Hayward ’11, a Currier House Undergraduate Council representative, solicited e-mail responses immediately after the budget cut announcements from students in the Quad.Within 48 hours he had received over 300 responses—that totalled 75 pages—from Quad residents, he said.Hayward, who says he has surveyed Quad residents in the past, said this issue had the most response of any he had seen. From the responses Hayward said he found several overarching themes.“Theme number one is safety,” he said. “Theme number two is that it looks like the Quad is getting screwed here. The Quad is now a satellite campus.”The third theme, he said, was “students should have been consulted. A lot of these cuts are pretty poorly conceived.”Hayward said he has been showing the responses to deans and House Masters.“They’re getting read,” he said.All three themes have also come up across the Houses’ e-mail lists.Students have also been editing “Students Concerned for Harvard’s Future,” a wiki created by Amol K. Jain ’10 that allows students to voice their opinions on the budget cuts. More than 140 students have signed their name on the wiki saying that they are “concerned about the direction Harvard is headed and sympathize with a few or many of the perspectives on [the] site.”House Committee chairs, student group leaders, and UC members are organizing a rally to voice student opinion about the budget cuts.Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10, who helped to organize the event, said the discussion of budget cuts “really dominated the e-mail lists in a way I’d never seen before.”But she said she has yet to come to conclusion as to her position on specific budget cuts.“I’m supposed to represent everyone,” she said. “There’s too much of a diversity of opinion to say which issue I would support more than another. It’s not my job to have my own personal agenda on these.”—Staff writer Eric P. Newcomer can be reached at newcomer@fas.harvard.edu.

As the “journal of sex and sexuality” at Harvard College, H-Bomb has never wanted for visibility. But this year, its leaders found that even the subject matter’s inherent appeal has offered scant shelter from the financial crisis.In October, short over half the money required to go to press due to a nationwide crunch in advertising, the recently-revived publication faced the possibility of being unable to print its magazine.Instead, H-Bomb’s leaders turned to fundraising in a last-ditch effort in March to save the print publication, appealing to undergraduates over House e-mail lists to support the magazine’s mission, which had been “severely compromised” by the downturn.“[A]dvertising rates have plummeted, publishing costs have increased, and Harvard’s reserve for funding student projects has contracted,” the fundraising e-mail read. “While we’ve almost reached our fundraising goal, we still need $1,700 to be able to publish.”With the aid of $700 in student donations, H-Bomb made it to press, albeit in dramatically reduced fashion—printing only 1,000 copies compared to the 6,000 to 8,000 they used to publish, according to Colette S. Perold ’11, H-Bomb’s business manager. Still feeling the pinch even with the donations, H-Bomb also decided to switch—at least for this issue—from a free and door-dropped magazine to a publication sold in dining halls for $5 a copy.Other College student-run newspapers, magazines, and literary journals are similarly feeling the effects of the financial crisis and are adopting new business models to offset the burden of the recession.Publications built on advertising revenue have launched fundraising campaigns, cut back on circulation, traded ads for food or gifts to use in promotional events, and even gone online only—all in an effort to stay solvent in the worst economic climate in decades. And though its been trying, nearly all of Harvard’s student publications have managed to stay afloat.“We’ve been trying so hard and it’s paid off,” said Millicent M. Younger ’10, publisher of the Advocate—the oldest published college literary magazine in the United States. “What it comes down to is doing a lot more work to get the same results.”BACK TO BARTERINGFaced with advertisers’ reluctance to open their pocketbooks, Harvard student publications have sought payment of a different kind.The Advocate has liberally relied on ad-trade deals for food from local restaurants like Boloco or store credit elsewhere in the Square to make up for revenue lost from local advertisers.Anticipating the effects of the declining economy, Younger says the Advocate braced themselves by being more proactive about contacting advertisers and clientele. Their hard work paid off, since the upcoming issue will contain more ads than any other issue in recent years, says Younger.“We’re doing well probably because our rates are very low,” she says. “We’re not pushing [businesses] into buying the biggest size ad either.”Though the online Freeze Magazine—a fashion and lifestyle publication for college women—does not face the Advocate’s printing costs, they have still struggled to support promotional events and “minimags”—print previews of the online magazine.Freeze Executive Director Windsor G. Hanger ’10 says that since they do not want to charge student groups for advertising online, because their “primary responsibility is to serve the students,” the magazine has had to think outside the box—trading advertisers space for providing food at Freeze events.The publication has also suffered from the recent termination of the Women’s Center’s Ann Radcliffe Trust Grant, which had previously supported Freeze.To continue publication, the publication has reduced the size of their minimags, and Hanger says she does not foresee more problems.Freeze still receives Undergraduate Council funding, and in case that is cut as well, Hanger says the magazine will cut back on promotional events.The Harvard Crimson has also seen a significant decline in advertising revenue, according to President Maxwell L. Child '10, though he adds that this has been offset somewhat by substantial growth in their business printing other publications—both from Harvard and from elsewhere in the area.The paper will replace door-dropping to undergraduate rooms with a distribution system that places the papers in newsracks located at House entrances, dining halls, and other high-traffic locations on campus. Child says the measure, which is being rolled out on a trial basis, is a better distribution model regardless of the economy.Some unable to fully fund their publication through advertising have stayed alive through donations.The biannual Tuesday Magazine spends around $4,000 for each issue, and given the recent decline in advertising, generating the figure has become a daunting task.“It has been very difficult to get advertisements from local businesses and major corporations,” said Denise Xu ’11, business director of Tuesday Magazine. “We’re trying to get donations from people that we know who support our magazine as a cause.”Established in 2003, Tuesday Magazine has had to endure the growing pains of being a new publication, relying upon advertisements, subscriptions, donations from alumni and parents of current members as sources to generate income.The effects of the recession have not only affected Tuesday Magazine’s ability to gather advertisement sales, but also their ability to create an on-campus presence. The magazine has struggled to get sponsorships for their promotional events, such as Outwit—an annual freestyle competition, says Xu, who is also an active member of The Crimson’s Arts board.Despite the setbacks, the support from donations has been enough to keep Tuesday Magazine free of charge and consistent, Xu says.And as the financial future of print publications continues to look dire, other student magazines are following Freeze’s lead into cyberspace.THE FINAL FRONTIERFor publications seeking to keep their content free, the Internet has provided the perfect medium.Younger says The Advocate is working on getting a Web site up and running as a possible revenue stream.H-Bomb also plans to provide readers with the magazine’s content free of charge online.And both publications are reaching beyond campus for sources of subscription revenue—the Advocate to high schools, and H-Bomb to The Harvard Coop and potentially the Trident Booksellers and Café.“H-Bomb isn’t going anywhere,” says Perold, the magazine’s business manager. “We are intent on seeing that.”—Staff writer Brian Mejia can be reached at bmejia@fas.harvard.edu.—Staff writer Beverly E.

Harvard’s tax returns for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, detail over $4 million in compensation for top administrators, a figure likely to draw close scrutiny over the coming months, as the University implements deep budget cuts.According to the tax filings, University President Drew G. Faust took home $775,043 in salaries and benefits her first full year on the job, with $640,000 in cash compensation, $81,304 in moving and other expenses, and $53,739 in benefits. It is the first time Faust’s compensation information has been made available; University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to release her salary in her previous post as dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.Though there is precedent for raising a newly instated president’s compensation, the reported figure is only slightly higher—just over 2 percent (adjusted for inflation)—than the $758,034 former University President Lawrence H. Summers received in his last year in office. The tax returns also reveal a small salary hike for University Provost Steven E. Hyman, who served in the same position under Summers, compared to his raise last year. One of the three oft-mentioned internal candidates for the presidency at the time, Hyman was asked to stay on as Faust’s deputy in 2007—and received a 19 percent boost in total compensation, from $479,819 to $570,265, the next year in today’s dollars.Each of Harvard’s seven vice presidents drew between $250,000 to $418,000 in salaries, not including benefits.As the University’s $36.9 billion endowment is projected to suffer a 30 percent loss by the end of June, Harvard administrators intend to freeze all non-union employees’ salaries for the next year. But at a recent Town Hall meeting hosted by the Undergraduate Council, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith responded noncommittally to a student’s suggestion that administrators take salary cuts in the spirit of shouldering the burden of deep cutbacks across the University. The Faculty will need to close a $220 million deficit over the next two years, Smith said, but the range of budget cuts announced last week only account for $77 million in savings.“We still have $143 million dollars to go,” Smith said. “Just cutting a few administrator salaries isn’t going to erase this deficit.”And in recent interviews, Faust and Hyman—noting that the salary freeze also applies to administrators—similarly declined to say whether administrators would take compensation reductions.While compensation costs for all employees comprise roughly half of the University’s operating budget, top administrators said that cuts in faculty salaries would be detrimental to the University’s academic mission.Hyman said that it is important for Harvard both to remain competitive and to retain current faculty members lest peer institutions swoop in to lure away star faculty.“I would be very worried about faculty salary cuts, because what we want to do is retain our very best faculty,” Hyman said.But strong student sentiment over the past few weeks suggests that many students feel staff would disproportionately bear the brunt of budget cuts in the form of layoffs, while University management remains relatively untouched.Leaders at other universities such as Stanford and several public universities have offered to reduce their own salaries as part of cost-cutting measures.Stanford President John L. Hennessy announced last December that top administrators, including the university’s provost and seven school deans, will take an immediate voluntary 10 percent pay cut “in light of the extraordinary pressure on the university budget.”It is unclear how much of an impact the symbolic measure will have on Stanford’s finances—the university’s endowment valued at $17 billion as of June 2008 is expected to suffer at least a 30 percent decline—but Hennessy earned roughly $700,000 in salary and benefits in fiscal year 2007 according to federal tax filings.—Staff writer Athena Y.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Due to planned reductions in hot breakfast service, all Harvard University Dining Services workers will have to bid on new schedules and positions for next year in a process that dining hall staff say leaves them uncertain about their job security. According to a statement released Friday by HUDS Executive Director Ted A. Mayer, the staff reassignment seeks to accommodate the workers affected by the hot breakfast cut by filling some of the vacancies left by the early retirement program. The bid process was the mutual agreement of HUDS and Local 26, a union that represents hospitality workers in the Greater Boston area.“We remain hopeful that we can find an opening within HUDS for anyone in a position that is being eliminated due to the service changes,” the statement said. 17 dining hall staff took the early retirement package, and 24 jobs—12 cooks and 12 general service positions—are being cut as a result of the elimination of hot breakfast, according to Annenberg shop steward Larry E. Houston.Last Friday, dining hall employees received information packets that included bid forms listing all positions for next year—organized by dining halls, total hours per week, and day-by-day shifts. Employees have until Wednesday to submit their preferences, with the priority of bids determined by seniority, or the total time of service with HUDS. Results of the bid process will be announced on Friday.Though Mayer’s statement was optimistic about finding an opening for everyone, dining hall workers said they were upset about the announcement, citing worries about being laid off, demoted, or transferred to a different dining hall.  According to several dining hall workers, HUDS has not said whether there are enough positions to guarantee everyone a job next year.“We’re all really scared,” said William D. Nicolson Jr., who has worked as a general cook at Adams House for 15 years. “Our security is being ripped away.”The loss of security was evident for Stephanie I. Alfred, a saladperson in Lowell House who received her bid form only to realize that her current job position was unlisted and will be eliminated next year. She said she plans to apply for a position on the hot line at Lowell but is unsure whether she will be able to stay in the House, or whether she will be able to maintain a full-time position at all. “This isn’t fair,” said Alfred. “I have a family, too. I have bills to pay.”Dining hall workers also said the reduced number of positions next year could translate into a greater workload.For instance, in Adams House, only four general cook positions are up for bid for next year, down from the current total of five.“There’s a work overload,” said Vincent A. James Sr., who noted that the bid form indicated only one chef working the Tuesday dinner shift in Adams House, which regularly sees 400 students during that meal period. “I don’t know how they expect us to do this.”According to Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin, there is ongoing dialogue between the union and the University.Tomorrow, dining hall staff and students plan to rally in Harvard Yard at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. to protest the HUDS job cuts.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

As you sit there—hunched before your computer, reading this blog post in an irrational, desperate attempt to avoid studying for your final—you may be feeling kind of down. You don’t recognize any of the terms on your study guide because you haven’t gone to lecture since the midterm.  A semester’s worth of books, in pristine condition, tower around you in tall, menacing stacks.  There are less than 24 hours until your exam begins and you realize—as the nonchalance of reading period crashes and burns around you—that you have learned absolutely nothing all term. You are an utter failure.
Now might be a good time to ponder that great philosophical question: does any of it really matter? In the grand scheme of things, will your sense of well-being be affected by the fact that you failed this exam (meaning, got a B minus) many years ago?
Most of us would probably say no. But that doesn’t make it any less depressing now.
If you’ve been having a rough exams period and are in need of a good catharsis, read this. No, it isn’t one of those irritating stop-worrying-about-grades-because-they-don’t-actually-matter treatises.  It’s an article about a pretty amazing 70-year study that has followed about 200 Harvard students from the late 1930s (including JFK) to find out what truly makes us happy.
So what does really matter? What are the secrets to a well-adjusted life? Check out what we learned from the study, after the jump.
1) Great achievements now don’t necessarily guarantee a future of emotional well-being. Almost a third of the Harvard men in the study ended up meeting the criteria for mental illness at some point in their lives—and those who were fine at the beginning of the study were not necessarily the ones who were doing well at the end of their lives.  So those high-achievers who do all their reading, snap up all the departmental prizes and fellowships, and ruin your curve? They’re not set for life after all. Ha!
2) Everyone has issues, and there are good ways (i.e., having a sense of humor) and there are bad ways (i.e., having hallucinations) to deal with them. Some other good ways to deal with your problems: helping others, learning to anticipate and plan for future challenges, suppressing your attention to conflicts until it is a more appropriate time to deal with them, and/or channeling your negative energy into outlets like sports, arts, etc.
3) Exercising now, while you’re young, is good.  Seems obvious, right?  But the fun fact is that your current exercise habits are actually a better indicator of your future emotional rather than physical health.
4) Childhood involvement in activities is surprisingly the best indicator for your future mental health.  Since you probably arrived at Harvard with a very healthy list of extracurricular activities, you’re off to a great start. You knew that resume was good for something.
5) Your inability to navigate social situations now will have no real effect on your happiness in old age. Shy, anxious people don’t have very positive experiences in adolescence, but that doesn’t prevent them from enjoying their golden years. So, wallflowers, rejoice! You will grow out of your awkwardness. Maybe.
6) That said, relationships do matter. Although good sibling relationships seem to be the most beneficial kind, it really doesn’t matter whom you’re connecting with, as long as you’re connecting with someone. This was, in fact, the most unequivocal statement made by George Vaillant, the leader of the study: “That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”
So, dear FlyBy reader, good luck on your exams.  But if you do poorly, go make some friends! You’ll feel better, we promise.

You'll be seeing a lot more of these next year. As evinced by the budgetary changes announced last Monday, the head honchos over in University Hall seem to think students needs more fatty foods late at night to accompany their poor sleeping schedules and stress overload.
So we're not talking your ordinary PB&J-station-with-windfall-fruit brain break. We're talking themed ones, maybe with birthday hats or paper plates in special shapes or leather-bound menus in the future.
Yes, here are the special brain breaks coming up this week. Enjoy these end-of-the-year specials before you leave school for good and miss how that hallowed taste of squash sitteth on thy tongue.
Tonight (Monday):
Tuesday:
Wednesday:
Thursday:
Adams is pulling it for the team, it seems. Kirklanders, according to your House list, there is no special brain break tonight. Sorry. Eliot, one of you guys found a bottle of beer in the dining hall, but we don't think that constitutes a special brain break. Until the fall?

UPDATED 9:14 p.m.
 An unidentified man was shot sometime before 5 p.m. Monday in the basement of J-Entry of Kirkland House, in what House Master Tom Conley is calling "in most likelihood, a targeted shooting."
The victim was bleeding from the lower torso but still conscious, according to Dental School student Jared M. Sprague, who says he helped support the victim after the shooting. Sprague said the victim appeared to be a "college-aged" African American.
According to Conley, the victim was not a Kirkland resident, but not enough information was yet available for administrators to make a statement about whether he was a Harvard student.
Conley, who spoke to police shortly after the shooting, also said two to three suspects fled the scene after the incident. He added that the victim was in stable condition and had been brought to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
In response to a question about whether police were looking for a gunman, Cambridge Police Department spokesman James DeFrancesco responded that it was "very possible." DeFrancesco said he did not know whether the victim was a Harvard student. State police crews were doing forensics at the scene this evening.
At 7:20 p.m., a line of 11 Harvard and Cambridge police officers spaced themselves out across the grassy Malkin Athletic Center quad, walking toward Kirkland from the Lowell House side with heads bent as if looking for something.
Multiple students told The Crimson that they heard three noises that sounded like gunshots shortly before 5 p.m.
Bryant Bonner '09, a student in E entry of Kirkland, said he heard bangs, then "saw three people running from J entryway through my window. They were wearing baseball caps."
Greta Friar '11, who lives J-entry, said she heard three shots and immediately after someone saying, "Shit, shit! Oh, shit!" Friar said she later saw bullet casings on the stairwell in the entryway.
Kirkland House Masters Tom and Verena Conley notified the House of the shooting in an e-mail sent at 5:32 p.m. A Harvard University text message alert was sent to students subscribed to the system 13 minutes later.
"We ask everyone to cooperate with the police and staff in the hours ahead," the House Masters wrote. "We will apprise everyone of further developments."
Conley said later this evening that administrators were making preparations to extend �exam forgiveness� to students hampered by delays due to today's incident. The provisions would allow Kirkland residents to �renegotiate the taking of exams because people are unable to get to their things and their rooms," he said.
According to Conley, students were "visibly shaken but very reassured" as of this evening.
Around 8 p.m., University President Drew G. Faust walked into Kirkland, telling a reporter she was there to address students.
Sprague, the dental student who said he helped the victim, said he walking towards the Malkin Athletic Center from Education School when he saw the victim stumbling toward him. Another woman on the scene called 911 upon witnessing the student's distress, Sprague said.
A portion of Dunster Street was been blocked off starting at Mt. Auburn Street and extending south after police arrived on the scene.
Massachusetts, Cambridge, and Harvard police were all on the scene as of 6:30 p.m. News helicopters were also hovering overhead midway through the hour.

CORRECTION
An earlier update of this article incorrectly stated that Kirkland House Master Tom Conley said the victim was not a Harvard student. In fact, Conley only said that the victim was not a Kirkland resident.
