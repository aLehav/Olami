After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Late last year, when season seven of “The Walking Dead” began, I wrote a review proclaiming my confidence that the season might be one of the show’s best. Evidently, I was wrong. In fact, I was so disappointed that I joined what A.V. Club called “The Walking Dead Quitter’s Club.” But it’s a new year and nothing makes sense anymore, so I figured I’d tune in to the show’s midseason premiere.
The season began with Negan tearing down Rick Grimes and crew and pressing them violently into his service. Over the next seven episodes, Rick and crew bounce between outposts trying to gather support for an all-out war against Negan and his army (a brutal group ironically named The Saviors) while avoiding his ire.
We rejoin our heroes in the mansion at the Hilltop, the farming settlement whose plea for help incited the somewhat disjointed events of this season. After Gregory firmly rejects their proposal for rebellion and the townspeople heroically pledge their support anyway, the group makes their way to the Kingdom, where Maggie and Morgan have lived since the beginning of the season, to recruit soldiers of their own. In a single scene, Rick uses a combination of emotional appeal, inspirational words, and extended metaphor to try to convince the leader of that colony, King Ezekiel, to pledge his entire community to a (perhaps) unwinnable war and break a tenuous but safe peace with The Saviors. He claims to need the night to think, and indeed in the morning rejects their plea, but there are enough obvious cues to be sure that he—or his sympathetic general—is going to say yes before the season is over.
This kind of clichéd plot is what is so jarring about TWD’s seventh season: There’s a startling and sudden dearth of the realism that once made the show such compelling television. Whereas season seven has been mostly cloaked in a sense of invulnerability (there are, after all, a finite number of main characters kill), past seasons saw our heroes struggling for every scrap. In the first few seasons, Rick’s crew didn’t have anything handed to them for narrative convenience: Alliances were tenuous and broke easily, supplies were scarce, and danger was all around. Now, as they move into the relative safety of settlements, and the narrative moves to the larger scale of settlement-to-settlement aggression, the show has lost that sense of weight and consequence.
And it’s not just the larger themes of the show that have suffered—even individual scenes seem to lack a sense of dread. Why can the team disarm an explosive trap while a horde of zombies stumble ever closer, while the music warns of misfortune to come, when in the end everything works out? Why are Rick and Michonne able to miraculously start two defunct cars with a steel cable strung between them and slice their way through the horde to safety, pushing their way through a thick horde of zombies to settle comfortably into the seats? This kind of hubris would have resulted in some kind of punishment for the group earlier in the show’s history. As Michonne says, in a display of optimism that seems completely misplaced in the face of the show’s overarching theme—established by six seasons of critically acclaimed television—“You can smile…We’re the ones who live.”

“Free speech is coming to an end in America, and it’s not your fault—it’s theirs.”
Sound familiar? It’s a common accusation in political discourse nowadays—whether “they” are “liberal fascists” or “conservative deplorables.” Peruse the comments section of any mildly controversial piece and you will find a horde of angry commenters accusing the other side of silencing dissent. Hearing these people, one would imagine free speech is dead, the country is doomed, and democracy as we know it is coming to an end.
But never mind these unending predictions of apocalypse. We have reached a point where dissent has become incomplete without offensive language, and one finds it difficult to have a substantive political discussion without resorting to insults, name-calling, or, even worse, harassment and complete silencing of the opposition.
Milo Yiannopoulos, shortly before his downfall, was the epitome of this desire to insult rather than debate. He would regularly turn issues of politics into into bloody battles where nothing is sacred and all is profane. Under the excuse of protecting free speech, Yiannopoulos has notably repeatedly attacked a transgender student for her identity and organized Internet trolls to send hateful tweets towards actress Leslie Jones for her role in “Ghostbusters.”
Such sentiments are echoed even by our president, who recently tweeted in an unsubstantiated accusation that President Obama had wiretapped his phone during his campaign: “This is McCarthyism!”
Not exactly, Mr. President. McCarthyism was a time of blacklisting by the government on trumped-up charges (pardon the pun). Suspected “Communists,” minorities, women, and homosexuals did not have the latitude of free expression they thankfully do today. Obscenity laws prevented the distribution and expression of various types of free speech, especially that of a sexual nature. And many Hollywood entertainment professionals were blacklisted and falsely claimed to be Communist subversives. The government doesn’t practice this today, thankfully, but the President seems to be starting to.
Free speech today is freer than it’s ever been. It is unrecognizable from the McCarthy days that Trump pointed to. So why do some believe it is dead, when we are clearly far beyond the 1950s?
Take the reaction to what happened at UC Berkeley when Yiannopoulos was prevented from speaking there last month. There was no end to the critics, including our own President, who condemned Berkeley and “the left” for “censoring free speech,” as Milo himself said. The university did not violate the first amendment—Yiannopoulos was originally allowed to speak there, after all. As many have noted, most students did not actually participate in the riot; they chose to peacefully protest outside the event, exercising their First Amendment right to do so, just as Milo’s right to speak wasn’t impeded by them or the university. The non-peaceful protesters are to blame, and though they might be forgiven for their beliefs, their successful attempt to silence Yiannopoulos was overdone and unfair, and should not be tolerated. Looking at the event’s critics, however, Trump’s reaction to the protest was also overdone—responding to unjust silencing with more silencing.
The problem with today is not that speech isn’t free, but rather that individuals on both sides have tried to use extreme measures to insult, silence, and discredit each other. Both sides talk of tolerance but both sides use their “free speech” to create intolerance. The right is no less guilty than the violent protestors on the left. Extremists on both sides have called professors “disgusting,” forcing them to step down for their beliefs, as others have taken on the role of Internet trolls who force people to back down out of fear of being publicly shamed.
Actions on both sides are unacceptable and resort to inexcusable tactics to silence opposition. The only time free speech shouldn’t be “free” is when it attempts to silence that of others. This form of silencing, of “anti-free speech,” as it were, is a form of free speech, but it is one that undermines this very right basic rights, of liberals, conservatives, allies, and critics alike.
Sound and fury don’t lead anywhere: well-founded arguments do. For example, after a particularly controversial staff editorial a few weeks ago, The Crimson was criticized uniformly as “spoiled rich Ivy Leaguers” and “liberal fascist pansies” despite the diversity of thought present on the Editorial Board. Very few commenters engaged in substantive discourse as to why they disagreed. Tolerance of such speech leads to intolerance.
Of course, both sides are at fault for playing into this game of silence. Free speech isn’t dead, by any means. And McCarthyism isn’t being practiced by the government at large, regardless of what some may believe. But it might just be practiced by ourselves, at least in spirit, if not in outright subversion, to each other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his Q&A at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 24, Stephen K. Bannon—former Breitbart editor and now President Donald J. Trump’s chief strategist—said that one of the chief goals of the new administration is the “deconstruction of the administrative state.” Continuing on this line of argument, he said that “if you look at [Trump’s] cabinet appointees, they were selected for a reason and that is deconstruction.”
In essence, Bannon revealed at CPAC that the Trump administration views itself to be at war with a great boogeyman of the conservative movement, a specter signified by the term “administrative state.” Google the term, and you will find a collection of articles by conservative scholars arguing that this entity is the enemy of American liberty and constitutional government. Nothing could be further from the truth.
The “administrative state” is, at its most broad, simply a term to refer to the agencies of government empowered by Congress to enforce duly enacted laws. For instance, the administrative state contains agencies like the Federal Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, which stand accused of promulgating burdensome regulations. A whole column could be devoted to why the FDA and EPA are, in fact, necessary to protect American citizens from bad drugs and environmentally suspect business practices. This column, however, is not about agencies like those two that regulate business.
This column is instead about the parts of the administrative state that directly ensure that working Americans, veterans and their families, schoolchildren and college students, and the elderly all lead freer and more prosperous lives. Not only has the “administrative state” been a crucial component of American democracy since its conception, but it is also at the very core of government programs that have moved our nation closer to the more perfect union envisioned by the Constitution. To denounce it wholesale is to demonstrate a profound ignorance of history and policy.
As Jerry Mashaw, a Yale law professor, has shown, the perception that this state is a twentieth-century abomination of unaccountable bureaucrats never countenanced by the founders is a myth. Mashaw points out that even the broad grants of power given to the early War and State Departments left much up to interpretation. Early federal customs officials also had extraordinary discretion in their enforcement of the law.
This administrative arm of American government, present since its founding, became more crucial as the United States confronted industrialization and conflicts on the scale of the Civil War. Pensions, patents, and postal issues were all under the purview of organizations we would now call administrative agencies.
This historical reality makes a great deal of sense. To paraphrase Mashaw, laws have never just enforced themselves. If—as the President of Harvard tells graduates of the Law School each Commencement—laws are “those wise restraints that make men free,” the administrative state ensures those restraints are applied with the appropriate vigor in everyday situations.
Unlike the leviathan of GOP caricature, this administrative state often works on behalf of the most vulnerable.  Since 1789, it has been responsible for the pensions of those who have fought on behalf of our nation. After hundreds of thousands died during the Civil War, those duties took on even greater significance. And during the three most important spurts of political and economic imagination in American history—Reconstruction, the New Deal, and the Great Society—the administrative state was at the forefront of innovative social programs. The Freedman’s Bureau, the Social Security Administration, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services—all three are monuments to the necessity of the administrative state, and two are still central to American life.
Of course, the administrative state is imperfect, like all government. But responding to that imperfection by arguing for its “deconstruction” is about as sensible as amputating a leg because of a broken toe. The goal of deconstruction is also intensely hypocritical. One highly imperfect area of the administrative state is immigration enforcement, but the Trump administration seems unlikely to “deconstruct” that part of it. Indeed, administrative agencies tasked with enforcing immigration law have behaved more arbitrarily since January 20. Put simply, the Trump administration wants to deconstruct the portions of the administrative state it does not like, and keep others for its own devices.
When Bannon singled out the administrative state, he did not just target an ideological concept or utter typically Trumpian nonsense. He declared war on widows and widowers who depend on the Department of Veteran Affairs for their pensions. He declared war on students with federal grants. He declared war on seniors who rely on Social Security and Medicare. He declared war on every American who expects their government to address problems effectively, flexibly, and responsibly. He declared war on every program that has tried to make our society more just for more of its people.
The administrative state may seem obtuse, but it is at the core of our experiment in self-government. Crude and craven attacks on it should inspire nothing but contempt and resistance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduate Council leaders are following through on a campaign promise to create the equivalent of a Q Guide, the widely used course rating website, for comps, the means for joining many student organizations on campus. UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 envision the guide as a forum through which students will share feedback about different comps, including information about the often substantial time commitments involved. While there is a strong need for reforming the Harvard extracurricular experience, the proposed Q Guide for comps faces serious obstacles that prevent us from supporting it in its current form.
Many students struggle to find interesting extracurricular commitments in the absence of a centralized source of information on student organizations. This is especially true for freshmen, who must embark on a lengthy exploration of Harvard’s over 400 student organizations before settling into fulfilling roles. Given the general lack of transparency in comp requirements and the culture surrounding them, students may find that comps turn out to drastically differ from expectations. Because this process is at the center of non-academic student life, there is a clear need for reform. To this end, there is merit in any idea that aims to address these issues and lower barriers to inclusion in extracurricular experiences. We commend the UC for their proactive work.
It is still unclear, though, how the UC leadership intends to incentivize students to participate in the survey that would populate the Q Guide for comps. The potential for sampling bias, where only individuals with strong views contribute, is too high. In the absence of a fair incentive, the proposed guide may simply show a disproportionate sample subset representing the most opinionated compers. The result would overestimate comp difficulty and potentially discourage students from joining organizations where they may actually have felt at home.
On the other hand, making the survey a comp requirement late in the comp may positively select for those who are already committed to the organization. Additionally, while the Q Guide for classes incentivizes students by offering the opportunity to view grades early, there is no clear analogue for comp processes. The UC leadership should place less of an emphasis on translating the course Q Guide into one for organizations and should focus instead on building the most helpful tool for students.
Furthermore, avoiding sampling biases is possible only if the proposed tool verifies the identities of compers who give feedback. This would also be necessary to prevent false allegations, especially of serious offenses, from online trolls or members of rival organizations. Sachee and Khansarinia plan to partner with Harvard University Information Technology in administering the guide, presumably for this reason.
Yet in overcoming one obstacle, verification creates a problem of privacy. By having to verify that a student did indeed comp an organization, student leaders inevitably have to disclose the names of individuals involved in their organizations. Even in the absence of a breach in the ethical behavior of administrators and organization leaders, students may desire to keep their extracurricular involvements private from the UC.
Given that the Q Guide for comps was a major campaign promise from Sachee and Khansarinia, it is disheartening that we have yet to hear of the basic details for this proposal. This includes the timeline for incentivizing survey participation as well as the process for verifying compers’ identities while protecting their privacy from school administrators and student organization leaders. UC leadership should instead consider other ways of connecting students, especially freshmen, to fulfilling organizations, including in ways that look beyond the comp.
That said, the desire for something like a Q Guide for comps should serve as a wake-up call for the community. Extracurriculars are conducive to forging new friends and new experiences. Yet in them we have created a complicated, exclusionary, and stressful process. It is right to work to make involvement in student organizations a break from academic work, not a continuation of it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Au Bon Pain and other Smith Center businesses closed for construction, some of Harvard Square's homeless have been forced to look for new places to spend their daytime hours. For some, the Garage in Harvard Square has filled this gap.
According to Gail Bucher, president of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter Corporation, the Smith Center renovations—and the closure of the stores that populated it—have displaced the homeless population that would often pass time on the center's premises.
A man who identified himself as "Kimbo Slice" and said he has been periodically homeless for twenty years now frequents the Garage.
“Au Bon Pain was a good place to sit when it was cold, but now it’s gone,” he said. “With the construction there aren’t many places to go anymore, so now I hang out around the Garage."
Slice added that most businesses in the Garage were kind to him, and that he sometimes goes to the Starbucks in the Garage to get a free drink, where he said the staff are quite generous.
Amit Luthra, a manager at Chutney’s in the Garage, though, said the increased homeless presence outside of Chutney’s has hurt his business.
Luthra stressed that he did not blame the locals for their circumstances and was sympathetic to the difficulties experienced by those who are homeless, but that the Indian eatery would not “entertain them by giving them free food.”
Despite some restaurants’ reluctance to hand out food to those who are homeless, other establishments donate their surplus food to local homeless shelters.
“Our shelters are pretty well stocked and that’s because at the end of the day many of the businesses take the food that is left and bring it to the shelter,” said Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “So there is some benevolence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several dozen students listened to Hillary Clinton speak about her own college experience at Wellesley and the value of learning from peers’ experiences and perspectives at a “Fireside Chat” in Kirkland House Friday.
Undergraduate members of the Instiute of Politics' Student Advisory Committee, some board members of the Harvard College Democrats, and five Kirkland students who received lottery tickets attended the chat. Jesse I. Shelburne ’18 and Sharon Yang ’18, the student president and vice president of the IOP, respectively,  moderated the discussion with Clinton.
After her appearance in Kirkland House, Clinton took part in an interview later that day for the “American Secretaries of State Project: Negotiation, Diplomacy, and Statecraft,” a joint effort of the Law School, the Kennedy School, and the Business School.
Students who attended the Kirkland talk said the small size of the event made it feel particularly intimate, and that they admired Clinton’s optimism and the candor with which she spoke about her own formative experiences in college.
“You never get a sense of who politicians are. But getting to hear Secretary Clinton talk about her life, and and her college life, was really really cool to see because you don’t get to see that,” said Christie F. Cheng ’17, one of the five Kirkland residents who received a ticket through the lottery.
“I’d say the main difference between a big lecture and an informal chat was that even though she came in with certain ideas that she wanted to communicate, it wasn't a prepared speech,” Cheng continued. “It made the experience much more meaningful, and we became very aware that this was a privilege to hear her speak candidly.”
Matthew Moore ’19, the treasurer for the College Democrats, said it was powerful to hear about Clinton’s college years.
“Her talking about her time at Wellesley, and how that shaped her, was something I had never heard from her. So it was interesting to hear how Hillary Clinton became Hillary Clinton,” Moore said.
Reed T. Shafer-Ray ‘18, the legislative director for the Democrats, said Clinton “was a big fan of  putting down the phones and really trying to make good friendships.”
He added that Clinton talked about how “school isn’t just about the classroom, you need to sometimes put the book down and talk to your classmates and that that is where you can get some of your most enlightening experiences.”
The former Secretary of State also spent time talking about the continuing fight for women in politics, which Cheng said was powerful to hear.
“Being at Harvard we probably have one of the biggest advantages [as women], and she spoke a lot about how it can be a brutal world—a man’s world— and that was really special,” Cheng said.
Vice President of the College Democrats W. Tanner Gildea ’19 said he admired Clinton’s humor throughout the discussion.
“You would always hear that she was much more funny in person and that you just didn't see it on the campaign and that just showed—we were cracking up at some of the things she was saying,” Gildea said. “[We saw] that she is on her feet fighting and also able to make funny quips of her experience.”

Harvard students and professors could find their daily course schedules reshuffled—with classes lasting 75 minutes followed by 15 minutes of passing time, instead of the traditional “Harvard Time”—as early as the fall of 2018.
At their monthly meeting Tuesday, the Faculty of Arts and Science will discuss a motion submitted by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris to change Harvard’s course schedule in preparation for the opening of Harvard’s new campus in Allston. The goal of the changed course schedule is to allow students to travel between Harvard’s academic buildings in Cambridge and the new buildings across the river.
The text of Harris’s motion outlines a schedule with 45 minute separations between the start of Cambridge and Allston courses, with the earliest Cambridge courses starting at 9 a.m and Allston courses beginning at 9:45 a.m. The final official course start times would be at 7:30 p.m in Cambridge and 8:15 p.m in Allston.
While the Allston campus isn’t slated to open until 2020, the changes will begin in the fall of 2018, should the motion pass. If so, the committee will review the efficacy of the program after one year, in the fall of 2019 and again five years later.
Under the most recent  proposal, one hour courses would be extended to 75 minutes, although instructors would not be required to use the whole time, followed by 15 minutes of designated passing time between courses that occurred on the same campus. The proposed schedule would end the de facto seven minute grace period between classes colloquially known as “Harvard Time.”
Courses which usually last longer than an hour, like seminars and labs, would be restricted to certain time slots.
Due to FAS procedures, the Faculty can only discuss the motion on Tuesday. The earliest the motion could be approved is at April’s Faculty meeting. This is not the first time the Faculty have discussed amending Harvard’s course schedules. At last April’s Faculty meeting, Harris presented two possible proposals to FAS. After the meeting, and further consultation with the Faculty Council, the current motion was born.
FAS currently schedules over 80 percent of its lecture courses between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m, according to a Frequently Asked Questions document distributed to Faculty members alongside the motion. The document states that this clumping of courses overburdens the number of available classrooms. The new legislation mandates that departments spread out courses within a 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. schedule so that there is a roughly even distribution of classes at each start time.
Unlike previous proposals, courses meeting more than once a week would continue to meet on a Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or a Tuesday and Thursday schedule.
FAS has been considering a change to its scheduling policy since 2013, according to a document distributed to professors before the Faculty meeting. Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 convened a committee in 2013, headed by Harris and Deputy Provost Peggy Newell. Committee members met with a variety of student and faculty groups, including the Undergraduate Council Education Committee, and the FAS Undergraduate Educational Policy Committee.
Also on the agenda for Tuesday’s meeting is a report from government Professor Danielle S. Allen on the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging.  University President Drew G. Faust convened the committee in September to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment.
In addition, Statistics department chair Neil Shephard will move that Faust create a Standing Committee on the S.M. Degree in Data Science. The motion was discussed at last month’s faculty meeting.

UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 12:05 a.m. Viola Davis spoke to a sold-out Sanders Theatre audience at the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations’ 32nd annual Cultural Rhythms festival, which featured a week-long conversation series in addition to musical performances at the Saturday show.1321227
Davis, an Oscar-winning actress named the Foundation’s 2017 Artist of the Year, spoke at Cultural Rhythms about her time in Gambia, where she studied West African culture and art. Davis said she was inspired by a particular ritual in the country, in which women unable to conceive children would ask God for fertility. Davis said she found the ritual to be similar to the life of an artist, in that art often confronts difficult and “shameful” parts of life.
“I want them to feel less alone. I think Picasso was one who said, ‘I paint because I want to show people what’s going on behind the eyes,’ and that’s the power of what I do,” Davis said in her speech.
During the show, Davis also watched performances from some of the College’s artistic and cultural groups, such as the Asian American Dance Troupe, Bhangra, and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College. For co-directors Cengiz Cemaloglu ’18 and Olutoyin Demuren ’18, Cultural Rhythms aimed to “honor and celebrate the diversity of Harvard” through artistic expression.
Cemaloglu said Cultural Rhythms attempts to “cultivate, complicate, and celebrate” a view of culture that all people create and “in turn, creates and re-creates us.”
“We don’t need to not only celebrate our identity and where we are coming from, but we have the obligation to celebrate other peoples and their identities and cultures, to collectively live together,” Cemaloglu said after the show.
Several students who attended Cultural Rhythms Saturday said they were inspired by Davis's speech.
Jonathan S. Roberts ’17, who co-hosted the show with Karen Chee '17, called Davis a “pioneer” and “trailblazer” in the arts in his closing remarks.
“I think that’s what Viola Davis really means. It means that little black girls can wake up in the morning and say, ‘Well, I can be an actress too, right? I can do what she did,’” Roberts said.
For the second year, Saturday’s performances were preceded by a week-long dialogue series, which covered topics involving art and race relations.
According to Jess J. Erion ’19, an intern at the Foundation who co-directed the dialogue series, the week’s discussions were meant to create space for “substantive conversation that is directed towards action.” Erion said the Foundation worked with other College groups, like the Harvard College Women’s Center and Office of BGLTQ Student Life to ensure multiple dimensions of identity were included in the programming.
“When it comes to inclusivity, it is important to say that all identities are welcome,” Erion said. “All identities are intersectional and all identities are political and we can’t pretend that those can be evenly separated from one another.”
To conclude the week, the Harvard Foundation co-hosted a town hall with College administrators to field students’ questions on diversity initiatives at Harvard and devise a plan of action to address concerns.

After spending more money than anticipated at what Undergraduate Council representatives deemed a successful event, the UC voted to retroactively fund “Common Room Crawl,” an event meant to promote inclusive social spaces on campus.
While the Council’s Freshman Class Committee received $550 from the “Everything But Alcohol” grant— which funds dry on-campus social events—and the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors, organizers quickly ran over budget as more students attended than expected, according to FCC Chair Catherine L. Zhang ’19.
The committee asked for $328.82 in retroactive reimbursement at the UC’s general meeting Sunday.
“Common Room Crawl” took place on Friday in four common rooms across the Yard and used speakers, a projector, and lights from the original allotted funds.
“In the night, we realized there was a huge influx of students who were coming. We actually didn't expect the event to be that successful, but it was awesome,” Zhang said in an interview after the meeting. “So we had decided to get more food in order to make sure we were able to appease as many people as we could.”
Speaking on behalf of the committee, FCC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 asked for the retroactive funding in front of the Council. She asked that the money come out of the FCC’s budget.
Khoury said while the Common Room Crawl in Crimson Yard ended up ordering more pizza than anticipated and members of the FCC spent a generous sum of money during the planning process, and all materials were utilized.
“I know that for Crimson Yard, we did our event in [Wigglesworth Hall], and halfway through the event, we ordered twice the amount of pizza,” she said. “But also before then, in planning, a bunch of people went over to Costco and we had a big expenditure. It was all used in the end, so nothing was left over in the end of the night.”
Later on in the meeting, other UC representatives asked Khoury how the FCC will be sure to remain on budget in planning for future events.
“Do you guys have any safeguards in mind in the future so this doesn’t happen again?” asked Lowell House representative Samarth Gupta ’18, who said he was against funding the reimbursement.
Khoury said she plans to be more “detailed” with ordering food and supplies for future events.
“I think a part of it is just honing in in a more detailed way with exactly what we’re going to get and looking at the prices and weighing things a little bit more instead right before of saying, ‘we’re just going to get this much food,’” Khoury said.
Dunster House representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said the Council should fund the FCC not only for the event’s success, but also because members paid out of pocket for food.
Ultimately, the legislation passed with only two members of the Council voting against it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2017 at 2:52 p.m.
After announcing plans to go gender neutral last fall, the formerly all-female Sablière Society—now rebranded as the Sab Club—inducted a group of 14 men into their ranks this weekend, according to undergraduate president Lulu S. Chua-Rubenfeld ’18.
The new members were accepted following an abbreviated “punch,” a final club-specific term for the membership selection process. Chua-Rubenfeld said the club, which does not traditionally conduct a spring punch, decided to admit a number of men ahead of next fall’s open punch so that the new members could advise the club’s transition to a fully gender-neutral club.
“We wanted to do this in a way that would make incoming members next fall most welcome,” Chua-Rubenfeld said. “Without mentioning other clubs or anything, we didn’t want it to be a situation where we were punching boys just as a room full of women, with no male advisory members and no male current members.”
The club has also changed its name, logo, and club color in an effort to reflect the new gender neutral composition of its membership.
“The Sablière was originally named after a female French figure,” Chua-Rubenfeld said. “We decided that along with the logo, which was a swan, and the color, which was a light blue, we just wanted to do some rebranding so that it’d match our transition into gender neutral [membership].”
The Sab’s decision comes more than a year after the formerly all-male Spee Club elected its first group of both men and women in November 2015, officially becoming a gender neutral club. The Spee did not add women to their membership before conducting a gender-neutral punch.
Undergraduate members of the all-male Fox Club also accepted a group of junior and senior women into its membership six weeks after the Spee, though a subsequent vote among the club’s graduate members barred undergraduates from extending membership to future classes of women.
In the case of the Fox, undergraduate leaders cited pressure from administrators for the decision, writing that Harvard had “forced [their] hand.” Since then, the College has announced sanctions against single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations that, starting with the Class of 2021, will bar students involved in those groups from leadership positions and College endorsement for certain prestigious fellowships. A faculty committee is reconsidering those penalties.
In announcing the change last fall, then-president of the Sab Reva Nohria ’17 said that while the administrative pressure had some influence, the decision came primarily from the club’s members. On Friday, Chua-Rubenfeld echoed that sentiment.
“Our club made this vote before the sanctions came out, because it was something that we thought was important,” she said. “The original reasoning was that in so many times throughout Harvard’s history, it’s been the men who have been opening up their spaces to women—even in the case of Harvard and Radcliffe.”
“We think it’s really empowering to be a women’s space opening up our organization to non-women,” she added.
Newly-inducted members of the club said they approved of the club’s move to gender neutrality.
“We are kind of getting out of this gendered idea and breaking out of this idea, because when the male-female barrier breaks down we kind of get into who you are as a person, as opposed to your gender and how you’re expected to perform as a male-identifying person or female-identifying person,” new Sab Club member Tynan Jackson ’19 said.
Matthew Moore ’19, another new Sab Club member, said he saw membership as “a great opportunity for redefining the social scene in a way that isn’t dominated by just males.”
“This hopefully sends a message that there can be situations where men and women and even those who don’t identify as men or women can have an equal share in Harvard’s social scene,” Moore said.
In response to news of the Sab going gender neutral, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana repeated his oft-cited thoughts on creating  “an inclusive and belonging culture.”
“Harvard College is committed to having a nondiscriminatory experience for all of our students,” Khurana said. “I think this is something that our community does together. I think creating that experience as a baseline of being nondiscriminatory, and then on top of that being an inclusive and belonging culture—it’s on all of us.”
Chua-Rubenfeld also spoke of the Sab’s commitment to “what it means to be inclusive on campus,” citing their financial aid program.
“We’re really trying to move first on the inclusivity front,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard undergraduates gathered in Holden Chapel Sunday to share concerns over the state of campus diversity initiatives, an event which concluded the Harvard Foundation’s week of Cultural Rhythms programming.
To begin the town hall, Foundation interns Cengiz Cemaloglu ’18 and Olutoyin Demuren ’18 asked attendees—including Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—how the College “can build the Harvard we desire.”
Students largely pointed to an issue over a perceived lack of social spaces as fostering exclusivity at the College. Multiple attendees said they were disheartened by barriers to access of certain spaces, such as Greek organizations, final clubs, and some recognized organizations with rigid comp processes.
Students gathered Sunday afternoon in a town hall to tackle the question of how they could build a more inclusive Harvard.
Salma Abdelrahman ’20, an Undergraduate Council representative for Elm Yard who attended the town hall, highlighted the impact a lack of social spaces could have on future freshmen.
“The culture that you establish in freshman year really carries on throughout the rest of the four years,” she said. “If people are finding social spaces to be exclusive and that they have to comp things so that they can find social spaces, that sort of sets the tone for the rest of the four years.”
Administrators have attempted to grapple with this issue for some time. O’Dair, Khurana, and others have repeatedly cited a desire to recenter students’ social lives from off-campus spaces back to residential spaces like Houses and dorms. In a historic move, Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust unveiled a policy in May 2016 that will punish members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations beginning with the Class of 2021.
Attendees also pointed to what they called a lack of accountability measures for House tutors and freshman proctors, arguing that race relations tutors’ performance across Houses is largely unregulated and variable. They also said they found the tutors to be poorly trained.
O’Dair said College administrators had already begun to implement reforms for tutor training so that “students have the same experience in each of the Houses.” She said the College implemented a pilot program in January to strengthen training for Consent Advocates and Relationship Educators tutors, who work in Houses to promote good sexual health and conduct.
O’Dair added the College will look to expand the trainings to other tutorships, such as race relations tutors.
“It’s a pilot, but it’s a pilot we may want to replicate with other tutors,” O’Dair said. “So for example, with race relations tutors, we’d want to ensure competency training. We want to ensure that not just race relations tutors, but all tutors are able to work on issues of difference, on issues of sexual assault, prevention.”
Administrators largely remained quiet throughout the meeting, only speaking up near the end. Khurana said he hopes Sunday’s discussion will lead to further dialogue between students and administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 7, 2017 at 1:35 a.m.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana has tasked the Honor Council with helping enforce the College’s historic penalties on members of single-gender social groups, accepting the majority of recommendations from a wide-ranging report on the social group policy Monday.
The 46-page report, produced by a committee charged with recommending how to implement the College’s penalties, also calls for the creation of a new category of recognized social groups on campus, grants sororities and female final clubs an extended timeline to become co-ed, and significantly expands the number of fellowships barred to members of final clubs and Greek organizations.  Khurana emailed the report to the student body Monday afternoon and wrote he was accepting nearly all of the committee’s recommendations.
Though Khurana has accepted most of the recommendations, a faculty committee created last month will determine the final version of the penalties on members of single-gender social organizations. That committee will consider whether the policy should be “revised or replaced.”
Under the recommendations, students, starting with the class of 2021, who seek leadership positions, captaincies, or fellowships will have to sign a written statement affirming their commitment to “nondiscrimination on the basis of characteristics of ‘intrinsic identity,’ including gender.” Students will also have to affirm they do not currently belong to a single-gender final club or Greek organization, did not belong to one in the past year, and will not belong to one the year after their tenure in a leadership position or athletic captaincy ends.
The committee recommended that the Honor Council investigate students who violate the policy by “falsely affirming compliance,” though the report emphasized that students should “not perceive the policy as intrusive or punitive.”
“In the short run, we would rather err on the side of allowing some students to evade the restrictions than adopt processes that students regard as inquisitional,” the report reads.
Formed in the wake of a 2012 cheating scandal, the Honor Council is comprised of students, administrators, and faculty that hears cases concerning breaches of academic integrity. The body is responsible for adjudicating cheating cases, and has the power to hand down disciplinary sanctions such as requiring students to temporarily withdraw from Harvard.
While the committee’s report recommended the Honor Council investigate violations of the policy, College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that Khurana plans to enforce the penalties through two different methods. The Honor Council will investigate members of single-gender groups who apply to fellowships.
But for members of Greek organizations and final clubs who violate the policy by holding “organizational leadership roles,” the College “will employ a trust-based system modeled after the Honor Code,” Dane wrote.
“In any instance, where issues of jurisdiction appear to overlap, as described in the Honor Council procedures, the Dean of the College has discretion to designate the appropriate body,” Dane wrote.
The report additionally lays out a path to recognition for social groups transitioning from single-gender to co-ed status, creating a temporary “provisional social organization” designation for clubs who reconstitute themselves with “new characteristics and new goals.” According to the document, provisional social organizations must be composed entirely of students or alumni, maintain “non-discriminatory membership requirements,” and practice “local governance and autonomy.”
The report also calls for for a five-year “bridge” program for traditionally female final clubs and sororities that would allow these groups “to operate with gender focused missions” for some time after the College’s policy takes effect next fall.
“We intend that this bridge period enable these groups to make the transition to an open social status,” the report states, “with the understanding that the positive contributions of those organizations to the campus community would be assessed in three to five years.”
Douglas Melton, co-chair of the implementation committee, said he recognized the group’s recommendations would not lead to immediate change.
“Generally what we’re trying to help the College do is effect a cultural change and that won’t happen with one policy or in one month or in one year,” Melton said. “We’re not of the view that if [Khurana] followed our recommendations then next term everything would be picture perfect.”
“We’re trying to appeal to the better nature in us all,” Melton said.
Khurana did not accept all of the committee’s recommendations—specifically, he did not accept the recommendation that members of single-gender social groups be barred from leadership roles on The Crimson and the Undergraduate Council. Khurana wrote that that recommendation “warrants further deliberation.”
“The Crimson and the UC are different from our other student organizations in fundamental ways,” Khurana wrote in his email to undergraduates. “They are the primary forums through which students can hold the College accountable and, in the case of the UC, through which students can advocate for change.”
The recommendations expand the scope and detail the enforcement of the policy first announced in May 2016.
In January, amid Faculty criticism of the policy, Khurana called for the creation of the new committee that will reconsider the policy and deliver its own recommendations next fall. In their final report, implementation committee members wrote that the creation of the faculty committee complicated their work.
“These events have fostered skepticism about the intent and commitment to the policy, discouraged those students who are supportive of efforts to transform the nature of the clubs, and undermined the confidence and progress of those groups who have already made difficult decisions to move in a more inclusive direction,” the report adds.
The Crimson reported in February that members of the implementation committee were not aware of the new faculty committee’s existence until it was publicly announced. Melton and fellow committee co-chair Kay K. Shelemay said they hoped the faculty committee would build on their work.
“We feel we did a pretty good experiment and drew some justified conclusions based on the results,” Melton said. “If another group wants to do the experiment again, they can do that.”
“We wish them well,” Shelemay said.
The report also pointed to “press reports and claims by students and members of USGSOs” that the policy addressed issues of sexual assault as complicating their work.
“While that behavior and the environment that encourages [sexual assault] are wholly unacceptable, they are not the sole nor even the primary reason for the policy,” the report reads.
Shelemay echoed this point on Monday.
“We were not investigating sexual assault, and that was not the reason for which the implementation committee was constituted,” she said.
A University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention first formally called on the College to develop “a plan to address the problems presented by Final Clubs” last spring.
Khurana said he believes “gender equity across our academic, social environments help contribute to a better student culture, a better Harvard culture, that reduces the likelihood that people’s bodily integrity is violated.”
The report also details a plan for the “dissemination of a positive narrative around the new policy,” including a draft of a letter to incoming students, and “professional brochures.”
In the report, the implementation committee additionally proposed a number of alternative social initiatives and potential student spaces.
The committee suggested forming “inter-House dining societies” of around 40 students who would have weekly meals in the dining halls, and suggests those groups could “eat in elegant attire, read Chaucer out loud” and ultimately identify themselves with “a loose theme that is social, inclusive, and consistent with College values and mission.”
Citing a recommendation from a 2015 report on diversity at the College, the committee also recommended looking into a multicultural “agora”—possibly located in the Smith Campus Center—that “might consist of an attractive lounge, one or two work and discussion spaces, and a kitchen area.” The committee also recommended opening Loeb House to student events, renovating the SOCH as a “party center,” and repurposing administrative offices “housed in prime real estate” for student groups.
Reflecting on the committee’s work, Khurana said the report was “a powerful statement of our aspirations… as we create a nondiscriminatory undergraduate experience.”
“I think all of us recognize that Harvard is hard to get into,” Khurana said. “You shouldn’t have to get into it over and over again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA—With the Harvard men’s basketball team down by two and just over 20 seconds left on the clock, freshman Bryce Aiken dribbled into the paint where he was fouled to put the Crimson in the bonus. He would make both to tie the game and give Penn one last possession.
For the second time in as many nights, though, Harvard could only watch as a last second shot decided the outcome of a game. The night before it was junior guard Amir Bell for Princeton. On Saturday night at the Palestra, it was sophomore guard Jackson Donahue for the Quakers.
Off the pass from freshman guard Devon Goodman, Donahue took a deep three just a step away from the Penn bench. The shot would hardly move the net as the Quakers would punch their ticket to the conference tournament on their home court next week.
“I thought both teams competed and played exceptionally hard and then Donahue just made an incredible shot there to win the game,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “A lot of credit to their team and congratulations to Steve and their program for finishing in the top four.”

DIFFERENT ROAD, SAME ENDING
While yesterday’s heartbreaker saw the Crimson outrebound the Tigers and freshman Seth Towns drop a career high 26 points, Saturday’s matchup was a lot of the opposite.
With Towns in foul trouble early, the Crimson lost some of its scoring and rebounding on the court early on. The freshman—who came in averaging 8 rebounds per game over the last three games—earned two fouls within the first three minutes of the game.
With Towns on the bench early, the Crimson struggled to match up with a tall Penn squad. In the first half, the Quakers outrebounded Harvard 18-13 and 5-2 on the offensive glass.
The lack of size also gave Penn the advantage inside as Harvard fouled the home team early and often. The Quakers would go to the line for 10 free throws in the first frame and would convert on all of them.
While the Crimson looked solely to Towns yesterday, Saturday night was a significantly more balanced effort. At the half, freshman forward Robert Baker had eight points, Aiken had another eight, co-captain Siyani Chambers had seven, and senior forward Zena Edosomwan had another eight.
“I thought our kids, especially Zena in particular, played hard and had a sense of spirit about him and competed and played at an exceptionally high level as a veteran, senior player,” Amaker said. “I thought just being here at the Palestra, it always gives you a sense of excitement, this is a historic place and a lot of basketball has been played here.”
The balanced effort would continue into the second half as Aiken, Chambers, and Edosomwan would carry the offensive load for Harvard. Aiken finished with a team-high 17 points, Chambers added 12 and six assists, and Edosomwan would finish the night with 15 points and 4 rebounds on 7-of-10 shooting from the field.
“[My teammates] are just doing a good job,” Edosomwan said. “I know with Siyani and Justin and Seth and Bryce driving or making plays that if I do what I do, set a good screen and roll, that they’re going to find me. My job is to just focus and finish it.”


THE OTHER GUYS
Against the Tigers on Friday it was senior Steven Cook who proved to be too much for the Crimson. Cook finished the game with a career-high-tying 30 points against Harvard at Jadwin Gymnasium.
On Saturday, it was another senior that Harvard could not contain.
Just a few minutes into the game co-captain Matt Howard made it immediately obvious he wasn’t ready to play his last college game. The senior scored Penn’s first 11 points and consistently played much bigger than a 6’4’’ guard.
“I’ve been around a lot of senior nights and it’s hard,” Penn head coach Steve Donahue said.
“[Howard] put us on his back and moved forward. It was awesome.”
The senior finished the game with 24 points and 12 rebounds on 8-of-13 shooting from the field, 2-of-4 from deep, and 6-of-7 at the line. For a Crimson team that’s somewhat small at the guard position, Howard simply proved to be too much on Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Harvard women’s basketball had a chance to make a late-season statement with a win over powerhouse Penn (19-7, Ivy 12-1), the top team in the conference.
Instead, the Crimson (20-7, 8-6 Ivy) suffered a crushing defeat at home, allowing the Quakers to capture an outright Ivy League title. Penn, which had never repeated as champions before, fulfilled unanimous media predictions of an Ancient Eight crown.
The Quakers dominated the hosts from the tip-off, never allowing Harvard to get ahead and keeping the young squad uncomfortable all night long.
“I think we had the same problem that we had the first time we played [Penn]. We weren’t hitting the shots we’re used to hitting,” co-captain Destiny Nunley said. “When we see shots not go in that we know should go in, we struggle to continue to have confidence in ourselves.”
With the final tally at 64-46, the improvement and revenge the Crimson sought after the 20-point loss a month earlier would not be achieved in its last night in Lavietes Pavilion. The Quakers’ two 6’3’” forwards, junior Michelle Nwokedi and senior Sydney Stipanovich, owned the front court on both ends of the floor. The players scored 22 and 10 points, respectively
“Obviously having two 6’3” girls in your front court will have some effect in your inside game,” freshman guard Katie Benzan said. “I think we did what was necessary to suck them into the paint and kick the ball out to the shooters. It’s just too bad that we didn’t hit them tonight.”
In this way, Benzan agreed with coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, who concluded that Harvard had gotten—but just not sank—the shots that the team wanted. Against a program like Penn with enough size and experience to overwhelm any Ivy League team, missing layups and open three-point shots added up over the course of the contest.
Harvard shot 29 percent from the field, almost as bad as the 26 percent performance at the Palestra a month earlier. A combination of inaccurate and timid shot-taking doomed the Crimson from the start.
“I just don’t know why [the shots] don’t go in,” Delaney-Smith said. “We played hard enough, but we have to put the ball in the basket. We are young and inconsistent in our swagger and believing in our shot.”
Both freshman standout Jeannie Boehm and sophomore guard Madeline Raster logged a single field goal each. With two of Harvard’s leaders struggling to find their rhythm, the rest of the team needed to try to pick up the slack. Unfortunately, that backup cast never materialized in Saturday’s matchup.
The Crimson struggled on the boards throughout play, as the Quakers collective 18 offensive rebounds on the night. Eleven came in the second half of play. At times, Penn’s oversized front court would just reach over Harvard players and collect the ball.
Penn jumped out to a 9-2 lead early in the first half, but the Crimson fought back to finish the quarter down by only two points. However, Penn shot ahead by 10 points, 34-24, before the start of intermission.
Despite late runs by the Crimson in the second half, the Quakers kept Harvard at bay and cruised to a back-to-back Ivy championship.
The overall narrative of the game mirrored the teams’ first meeting. Back then, the Crimson conceded an early lead and doomed itself to a blowout loss with poor shooting. That loss snapped a 16-game win streak.
Since then, Harvard has not fully recovered its form from that multi-month run. The Crimson has finished the season 4-6 and introduced clouds of doubt over a team that previously seemed destined for a sunny ending.
Now the No. 3 seed in the Ivy League tournament, Harvard will have a third and final crack at the No. 2 seed Princeton Tigers at the Palestra in Philadelphia.
“I just hope that we play with heart, intensity, and a sense of urgency,” Benzan said. “It’s really hard to beat a team three times, so when it really matters, it will be our time.”

Heading into the final set, Sacred Heart and Harvard (5-7, 3-4 EIVA) were deadlocked in a tie with two sets a piece.
The Crimson had started off strong with back-to-back wins of 25-23 and 25-19 before falling to the Pioneers (12-3, 5-2 EIVA) in the next two sets by scores of 25-19 and 25-17.
With this back-and-forth narrative as prologue, the decisive fifth set fell in favor of Sacred Heart, as the Pioneers triumphed in a 15-10 tiebreaker.
“I think we were doing really well the first two games,” co-captain Casey White said. “We just let off the gas pedal a little bit in the third game. Volleyball is a game of momentum, so giving them a game where we lose by upwards of eight points gives them all the momentum. It being a home game for them definitely helps swing the momentum their way.”
The fourth-set loss of 25-17 began with Sacred Heart leading the Crimson by seven points in the first half. Despite Harvard rallying back to come within six points of its opposition, the visitors ultimately fell short.
Previously in the third set, the Pioneers had built up their momentum by limiting the Crimson attack to a .207 hitting percentage, versus Sacred Heart’s mark of .452.
“We were determined not to let the break bother us,” coach Brian Baise said. “They played really good defense, [and] we had a really tough time scoring. The momentum shifted, and then we just never came back. We played a great first two sets. We went into break and just didn’t look like the same team after.”
The final set saw Harvard and the Pioneers go neck-and-neck for the first eight points, resulting in four points each, until Sacred Heart scored three times in a row to break free from the deadlock. Despite a last-ditch attempt by White with four kills, the Crimson ended the game with three straight lost sets in a row.
“They brought in a new setter who was switching up the looks from what we were getting used to in the first two games,” White said. “I think it was on our side. We didn’t play clean, and a lot of balls that we were putting away in the first two games, they started defending. You start to get a little frustrated when you can’t put the ball down like you were before, so we were a little frustrated. That affected our play a little bit.”
White now sits in second place in the all-time record book for career digs with 576 after this past weekend; he recently surpassed his own brother, D.J. White ‘15, who tallied 556 digs. White actually recorded 21 digs in the game against the Pioneers last year, slotting him in for third place all time in number of digs in a match.
“I think Casey, Chase [Howard] and Erik [Johnsson] did really well,” Baise said. “The focus of the last two or three weeks has been offense, and we will continue to focus on that.”
Harvard started off the game strong, leading Sacred Heart by one point consistently for the first 23 points. Multiple kills from freshman Matthew Ctvrtlik gave the Crimson the lead and finally allowed Harvard to clinch the set point.
Continuing its lead, Harvard went up 11-7 in the second set before the Pioneers caught up, tying the score at 13. Freshman Erik Johnsson aided the Crimson by winning four of the last six points for Harvard, allowing the Crimson to take the set 25-19.
Still, those early heroics could not save Harvard from its ultimate fate—a five-set conference loss that generated heartbreak, if also flashes of promise.
“Hitting percentages have been up the last couple matches, and we have been feeling good about things,” Baise said. “We’ve had a couple of really good weekends in a row…. We have to go out and see if we can find our rhythm again as well as our confidence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The weekend proved to be a tough one for the Harvard women’s water polo team (5-6, 0-1 CWPA). Although the Crimson held the Harvard Invitational at Blodgett Pool, the team went 1-3 overall.
Ranked No. 19, the hosts defeated No. 13 Marist but fell to No. 21 Wagner, No. 16 UC San Diego, and No. 11 Princeton.
NO. 21 WAGNER 4, NO. 19 HARVARD 3
Harvard’s early efforts fell short in its Sunday afternoon showdown with Wagner (5-9). Ultimately the Crimson dropped a tight game in the final quarter.
It was the Seahawks who struck first in the final day of play at the Harvard Invite, taking a 1-0 lead over Harvard. Yet a goal from senior Michelle Martinelli put the Crimson right back in it.
Following a score by junior Sami Strutner off a feed from senior Eela Nagaraj, Harvard held a 3-1 lead heading into the half.
Wagner scored in the third frame to cut into the Crimson’s advantage. Entering the fourth quarter, Harvard was up 3-2.
Two points from the Seahawks went unanswered in the final eight minutes, as they went on to win 4-3 in the tight contest.
NO. 19 HARVARD 10, NO. 23 MARIST 9
The Crimson snapped a three-game losing streak on Saturday night, beating Marist (6-7) in another close matchup.
After falling behind 1-0 to start the first frame, Harvard responded with two goals from sophomore Kristen Hong and freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz. Yet the Red Foxes matched both, making the score 3-2 as the first quarter of play closed.
With help from two seniors on senior night, the Crimson battled back. Martinelli scored to tie the game at 5-5 before Zoe Osborne put the ball in the net to put Harvard ahead by one.
“The team has been playing with our usual passion and fight,” Osborne said. “We just need to finish our opportunities.”
After three quarters of tight competition, both teams entered the final eight minutes with seven scores apiece. The Crimson looked to finish.
Two goals from Hong put Harvard up by two, but Marist continued to battle to the end. The Red Foxes matched Hong’s efforts to tie the game at a score of 9-9.
With 1:48 left to play, a ball from Marinelli sailed past the Marist goalie to give the Crimson the victory. The go-ahead goal marked the fourth of the night for the California native, who led the Harvard offense to seal the 10-9 win.
“The keys to our game are defense and staying mentally tough,” Nagaraj said.
NO. 16 UC SAN DIEGO 12, NO. 19 HARVARD 6
The Crimson dropped a dispiriting defeat on Saturday afternoon to UC San Diego (7-9), 12-6. Despite taking an early 1-0 lead with a goal by Freshman Mathilde Ribordy, Harvard could not hold off a fierce Triton offense.
With an additional three goals from each team, the first quarter ended with a tight score of 4-3 in favor of the Crimson. Harvard added to that lead, with both Hong and freshman Julie Harrison finding the net. Coupled with a strong defensive effort, the Crimson was able to maintain a 6-3 through the halfway point.
“The key is always an unbeatable defense,” Osborne said. “That will feed our entire game.”
Yet the tough Harvard defense that kept the Tritons scoreless in the second quarter faded as the game progressed. Outscoring Harvard by nine in the second half, UC San Diego surged past the Crimson, 12-6.
NO. 11 PRINCETON 7, NO. 19 HARVARD 4
An early deficit proved too much for Harvard to overcome in Friday night’s opener against Princeton (8-0, 1-0 CWPA). The Tigers pulled ahead by three in the opening minutes, and the Crimson never quite recovered.
Despite efforts made by the Crimson to close the lead, Harvard could not score a goal without Princeton offering an answer in return. Two goals for the Crimson by Hong and sophomore Haley Bowe narrowed the score to 3-2. Yet the Tigers quickly bounced back with two goals of their own.
Princeton maintained the advantage throughout, as the team went on to secure a 7-4 victory over Harvard.
“We just need to put our shots away,” Osborne said. “We have all these great opportunities, and finishing them is going to give us a lot of success.”
Senior Sami Strutner led the Crimson with three assists. On the defensive side, Osborne had three steals, and junior Cleo Harrington recorded six saves at the goalie position.
“It’s been a tough weekend but a great experience all around,” Nagaraj said. “We are excited to take what we have learned this weekend and make improvements going into our upcoming games.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend in Lewisburg, Penn., three Harvard wrestlers earned bids to the NCAA Tournament. Competing at the EIWA Championships, freshman Hunter Ladnier, tri-captain Josef Johnson, and tri-captain Jeffrey Ott bested enough opponents to punch elusive tickets.
“There’s so little that separates talented guys at the top,” Ott said. “It just comes down to who believes that they can do things that other people can’t do.”
Ladnier reserved his passage to St. Louis by upsetting Laike Gardner from Lehigh in the semifinals. Simultaneously, the victory vaulted Ladnier to the finals, the first Harvard rookie to reach that stage since former NCAA champion J.P. O’Connor, who graduated in 2010.
“I [wanted to] go out there and wrestle hard,” Ladnier said. “Believe in myself, believe in my coaches, and believe in my training—just go out there and compete.”
Ladnier ultimately fell, 8-5, but the guarantee of the NCAA Tournament remained intact. So did the thrill of that surprise win over Gardner.
“It was one of the most exciting matches I’ve ever seen,” tri-captain Jeffrey Ott said. “He just kept battling. It was amazing for him to make the finals.”
Teammates might draw similar amazement from Ott’s performance.
EIWA wrestlers qualify for the NCAA Tournament by finishing above a certain place. The number of top-ranked opponents in a weight class determines the number of bids.
In Ott’s case, a win in the semifinals would ensure a berth. The trouble was that Ott, a seven seed in the 16-wrestler bracket, had to square off against Kevin Devoy, a three seed from Drexel.
The matchup came to a sudden halt when Devoy felt his knee turn and screamed out in pain. A trainer’s decision ended the contest and handed Ott the NCAA bid.
It was a grotesque finish, to be sure, but carried a touch of irony. Earlier this season, a knee injury had sidelined Ott for around a month.
“I didn’t think I was going to wrestle for the rest of the season,” the senior said. “I’m just fortunate that I was able to step on the mat. I’m relishing every opportunity I get to strap on the anklets and wrestle one more time.”
Twice previously, Ott had left the EIWA Championships after overtime losses. The senior’s hopes seemed close to crashing again when, in the second round, the second-seeded Esteban Gomez Rivera held a late lead. But Ott spun around his opponent to grab a 6-3 victory.
That result set up the bout with Devoy—and the final elation.
“After that match in the semifinals, I went, sat by myself, and just cried a little bit,” Ott said. “It was something that I’d been working toward for so long.”
Junior Josef Johnson, the third Crimson wrestler to advance to NCAAs, took a more humdrum route. This season, Johnson was the only returning team member with NCAA experience. Hrentered the weekend as the five seed—tied for Ladnier as the highest of any Harvard wrestler.
In the opening round, Johnson routed the Eagles’ J. Salvi in a 12-3 major decision. Soon followed a 7-3 loss to a Navy opponent, but that result didn’t matter—Johnson had done enough to head to St. Louis.
“Joe is a staple of consistency,” Ott said. “[He’s] just winning the matches he needs to and qualifying.”
Not everyone experienced such success.
Freshman A.J. Jaffe had impressed teammates all year with a hardworking attitude and corresponding results. He started the weekend as the sixth-best wrestler at 141 lbs. and handled his first opponent.
However, Jaffe suffered a 10-8 defeat in his next bout, leaving him just outside the NCAA bubble.
“He did everything right all year,” Ott said. “He’s the best teammate you could ask for…. I feel for A.J., but he has three years ahead of him.”
Senior Kanon Dean also flirted with a berth only to fall short. Wrestling a five seed from Drexel, the 184-lb. veteran dropped a 3-2 decision in a down-to-the-wire bout.
“There are definitely some guys that are a little bit down on the way the season ended,” Ott said. “This is something that will have to sit with you for the next seven or eight months before next season starts. And for some, the seniors, it’s the last chance competing.”
No other Crimson athlete escaped the first round. Freshman Connor Sakmar (125 lbs.) lost 16-1 by technical fall, junior Logan Kirby (197 lbs.) suffered a fall, and freshman Kyle Bierdumpfel dropped a 14-4 major decision.
Meanwhile, Colby Knight and Nick Gajdzik—a pair of seniors—ended their Harvard careers with defeats by decision, with respective scores of 5-3 and 5-2.
Still, as Ladnier maintained, the veterans’ legacy lies in their ability to shape team culture.
“The leadership has been second-to-none. [Johnson and Ott] have been amazing role models,” Ladnier said. “They’re really approachable guys…. They pass leadership to other people and exude confidence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 6, 2017 at 9:19 p.m.
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team rallied behind a dominant defensive effort in the second half to beat the Vermont Catamounts (3-3) by a score of 13-10. For the second straight season, the Crimson improved to 4-0.
In the decisive fourth quarter, Harvard controlled all facets of play. With the Crimson holding a 10-9 lead, sophomore defenseman John Butler caused a turnover. Then tri-captain and senior defenseman Ryan Norton seized the ball and went coast to coast to pot his first goal of the season, putting the Crimson ahead by two.
“I was fortunate to get the ball, and I just ran as fast as I could,” said Norton. “When you have offensive threats like Morgan Cheek, Timmy Edmonds, and Ryan Graff, the defensemen are hugging their guys a little bit, so I was fortunate enough to get open down there and put it away.”
Harvard hadn’t allowed opponents into double figures entering Saturday’s matchup, and it looked like that streak might survive despite allowing nine first-half goals. But Vermont’s Dawes Milchling scored the Catamounts’ 10th goal with 2:48 to play.
However, that shot made little difference, as aided by Norton’s full-field jaunt, the hosts had already put the game to bed.
“[Norton] made a huge play in transition,” head coach Chris Wojcik said. “That goal really helped propel us to get a little breathing room and helped us separate to win this game.”
Playing inside the bubble at Harvard Stadium on Saturday afternoon, Harvard’s junior attackman Morgan Cheek drew first blood 55 seconds into play, and senior captain Sean Coleman added one of his own minutes later to put the Crimson two ahead.
Harvard’s early offensive production has been a major boon through four games.
“We came out really strong with good energy,” Wojcik said. “We moved the ball well and were really hitting our shots, but we got a little too comfortable. We started taking shots that weren’t the best shots we could get. We started taking the first thing, and their goalie made some saves.”
Cheek, the nation’s second-leading point scorer per game, needed only one half to extend his streak of hat tricks to four games. He scored his third goal with 6:16 to play in the second quarter.
Cheek finished the game with five goals and one assist, slightly below his 6.75 points-per-game average.
Vermont would fight back, though. The Catamounts’ offense was cranking on all cylinders from the outside, connecting on numerous shots from beyond 10 yards in the first half, as Harvard struggled to limit Vermont’s time and room. The Catamounts responded with six goals in the second quarter, including three unanswered to end the half.
Vermont lea 9-6 heading into the break.
“They were better on the ground and facing off in the first half,” Wojcik said. “They really dominated possession…. They moved the ball well and hit their shots. At halftime we challenged our team to be better on the ground, to take pride obviously playing on our home field.”
The trailing Crimson opened the second half with a flurry of strong defensive efforts. Behind Harvard’s relentless pressure, the Crimson forced a season-high 23 turnovers. Harvard hadn’t caused that many turnovers since April 4, 2014, when the team forced Boston University to cough up the ball 26 times.
“Our coaching staff challenged our guys to be aggressive and get out on guys’ hands—not to let them shoot with their feet set,” Wojcik said. “They played a really tough, physical half.”
In that second period, Vermont’s outside offense disappeared. Harvard limited leading point-scorer Cam Milligan, to no goals on six shots in the second half, and junior goalie Rob Shaw stopped eight of the nine shots on goal he saw after the break.
“Rob Shaw made saves, which inspired his teammates,” Wojcik said. “At the end of the half [Shaw] made a big save for us and got our defense a big stop. Then he came out after halftime and played exceptional.”
On the offensive end, the Crimson outscored the Catamounts 3-0 in the third quarter. Junior middie Spencer Evans, who saw increased usage on Saturday, scored the final goal of the quarter—his first of the season. The San Francisco native was assisted by former high school linemate Joe Lang, who had three assists on the day.
Thus the score was knotted at nine apiece heading into the final frame. That’s when Norton and company took over.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the Harvard indoor track and field team has done better this year it isn’t by standing on the shoulders of the greats, but by shattering their records. In total, six school records have fallen at the hands of the 2017 team and this weekend, the team claimed its latest victim—a 20-year 4x400 meter relay record.
Traveling to the Boston University Track and Tennis Center for the ICAAAA Championships, the quartet—junior James Heckendorn, sophomore Myles Marshall, junior Matt Hurst, and junior Alexander Moore—didn’t just beat the Crimson record, it destroyed it. Clocking a 3:10.84, the group beat the prior time by nearly three seconds and in the process set both the fourth-fastest time in Ivy League history and claimed a season Ancient Eight record.
“The point of this weekend was just to go out there and see what we were capable of doing,” Hurst said. “There wasn't a ton of pressure or nerves, it was just fun. I think the biggest thing was that we were all just stoked to get out there and run fast, without all of that extra baggage.”
The previous Harvard record of 3:13.54 was set by Kevin Johnson, Brian Young, Joseph Ciollo, and Thomas Mike III at the 1997 Indoor Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. Shattering this record, the 2017 group earned first in the preliminary round.
“Our coach has done a great job of having us peak at right time at the end of the indoor season, so we just trusted in that and trusted in our training thus far, and went for it,” Hurst said. “It was also a huge confidence booster going into the outdoor season, and I think it was a good sign of things to come. We were all really excited when we saw that time, and it was really cool to be apart of that team.”
Marshall clocked not only a record time with the relay team, but pulled a personal best in the second leg of the race. Even more, he went on to set a high bar in the 500-meter run. The sophomore ran the race in 1:02.56 to claim both the fastest time in the day’s preliminary races as well as the third-fastest time in the school history. Not too bad considering he holds the other top two times as well.
“The team has developed well over the season,” Marshall said. “We didn't like our team finish at the Ivy League championships, but we know we are in a good place moving forward to the outdoor season.”
Marshall chose not to compete in the finals Sunday as to not risk any injuries.
“We also don't compete a full team at these championships,” Marshall said. “We use it more for some individuals to achieve a fast time or mark and cap off the Indoor season on a high note.”
And that they did. Following a sixth place finish for the men’s team at the Ivy Heps, the band of runners came into the ICAAAA meet ranked 10th regionally looking to improve before a competitive outdoor season.
In the field, co-captain Julian Nunally threw 16.56 meters to claim seventh place in shotput at his last indoor meet wearing the crimson and white. In fact, the meet represented the last of the indoor portion of the season for the men’s team. Outdoor meets will commence following a two-week hiatus.
The women’s team, however, is not done quite yet. Ranked number one in the Northeast region and 37th—the only Ancient Eight team in the top 50—nationally, representatives of the team will travel to Texas A&M University next week for the NCAA indoor Championships.
Leading the team will be sophomore Gabby Thomas, competing in the 200-meter dash, having already broken several records of her own. Other representatives from the Crimson will include freshman Zoe Hughes in the pentathlon, senior Nikki Okwelogu in shotput, and freshman Judy Pendergast in the 5000-meter run. The four members traveling to Texas will be the largest group of racers Harvard has ever sent to the NCAA Indoor Championships.
For the men though, the season ended on a high note. With personal bests and yet another shattered record, the team is well prepared for the coming outdoor season.
“Our 4x4 time shows that we have been putting in a lot of work this off season and the past few months,” Marshall said. “Now we have all the right tools to compete really well come outdoors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Capping off a successful 2016-2017 campaign, the No. 2 Harvard men’s squash team sent two representatives to participate in the CSA Individual National Championships in Hanover, N.H. The Crimson’s top ranked player, freshman Saadeldin Abouaish, and sophomore Alexi Gosset competed in the Pool and Molloy North divisions of the event.
The duo posted strong results, as Abouaish placed in the fifth to eighth place range in his division, while Gosset claimed victory in the consolation bracket after losing his first-round matchup to Dartmouth sophomore Carson Spahr, 11-8, 11-4, 11-3.
Although he underperformed his third-place seeding, Abouaish finished with Harvard’s best result since 2015, when junior David Ryan made it to the semifinals as a rookie.  Last year, co-captain Bryan Koh finished in the ninth to twelfth place range of the Pool Division as the Crimson’s lone representative, improving on his fourteenth-place ranking in the process.
In his first-round match, Abouaish faced off against the man who doused the Crimson’s national championship hopes just two weeks beforehand, Trinity sophomore Michael Craig. The Cairo, Egypt native made quick work of his Bantam opponent, however, as a clean three-set victory seemed inevitable from the outset.
After completing the sweep, Abouaish tackled a tougher test against a fellow Egyptian, St. Lawrence junior Ahmed Bayoumy. The match was contested throughout. After winning the first game 12-10, the rookie allowed himself to be bested in the next two sets. Abouaish clawed his way back into the match with a fourth game victory, only to fade in the fifth. Ending his tournament, the defeat—10-12,11-9,11-8,9-11,11-4—pushed Abouaish to an 11-6 overall record in his first season for the Crimson.
As a lower seed in the tournament’s B Division, Gosset faced a different challenge than Abouaish. The sophomore’s first round match went as seeding predicted, but once in the consolation bracket, Gosset cruised, winning three consecutive matches to claim ninth place in the sixteen-man bracket.
In his run, the Canadian overcame Middlebury freshman Will Cembalest, George Washington senior Andres de Frutos, and Amherst junior Michael Groot in succession. Finishing on a high note, Gosset’s most dominant performance, 11-4, 11-5, 11-2, came in the finals against Groot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the 2017 Harvard baseball team, fresh off an offseason full of change, traveled to the nation’s capital to kick off its 43-game regular season with four games as part of the D.C. Grays Collegiate Challenge. The Crimson looked to take care of business in Washington, D.C. against two teams that had combined for one win and 10 losses before the start of weekend play.
Buoyed by an offensive outburst of 33 total runs, Harvard (4-0) did more than just take care of business—its weekend sweep illustrated the potential of a team firing on all cylinders.
“Everyone was ready to go, right off the bat,” sophomore outfielder Ben Skinner said. “We got off to a quick start, which definitely helped. We were able to get some momentum going and carried it through all four games.”
HARVARD 6, COPPIN ST. 2
Sophomore righty Kevin Stone pitched five innings of one-run ball, and his younger brother, freshman Grant Stone, picked him up with three innings of relief work, to guide the Crimson to a 6-2 win over Coppin State University (1-7) on Sunday.
“The bullpen was huge—it’s really nice when you can turn to your bullpen and be confident in them,” Skinner said. “We had some freshman arms that stepped up and they’re going to take on pretty big roles this season. We’re looking forward to watching them develop and help us as a program.”
Sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl drove in two runs on a fourth-inning homer to provide an early boost for Harvard. McColl also drew two walks on a weekend in which the Crimson drew 26 walks overall.
Meanwhile, junior Matt Rothenberg capped off his weekend by going 3-for-4 to up his early season batting average to .600.
“I thought we really played four complete games,” said Rothenberg, last season’s team leader in batting average and hits. “We swung it well, one-through-nine, [and] we got some great pitching performances. It’s huge for team momentum going forward.”
HARVARD 6, LAFAYETTE 0
Rothenberg was quick to point to junior righty Ian Miller’s complete game, one-hit shutout of Lafayette as the prime example of the weekend’s stellar pitching performance.
Indeed, Miller faced just two hitters above the minimum 27 and struck out eight in a nine-inning gem to lead Harvard to a 6-0 win over the Leopards (2-10) on Sunday.
On the offensive side, senior first baseman Matt Hink, who had just 15 plate appearances last year but a solid sophomore campaign, had a career day after driving in four runs on a pair of two-run home runs.
“I really think we have a good squad here,” Skinner said. “[Coach Bill Decker] mentioned that every single player got into a game at some point this weekend, which goes to show you how it was truly a team effort.”
Miller’s performance is a positive sign for a rotation that’s tasked with filling the sizeable hole that former Crimson ace Nick Gruener left. At the end of last season, Gruener elected to forgo his final year of eligibility to sign with the Baltimore Orioles.
Still, as Skinner notes, “the most important win is the next one”, and the downsized rotation, comprised of relatively inexperienced pitchers, will look to build off Miller’s spark.
HARVARD 14, COPPIN ST. 3
Harvard churned out 11 hits and got RBI’s across the lineup to down the Eagles and move to 2-0. McColl led the way with 3 RBI’s, while freshman leadoff hitter Quinn Hoffman, Hink, sophomore outfielder Patrick Robinson, senior infielder Drew Reid, sophomore outfielder John MacLean, and Skinner drove in runs.
The team’s consistent scoring, on top of the hot hitting, was catalyzed by five Coppin St. errors leading to six unearned runs.
Rothenberg went 1-for-3 in his first game of the season after sitting out the afternoon opener.
“As far as Matt goes, last season he was one of our best hitters, without a doubt,” Skinner said. “No one was surprised to see him come out and go six-for-10 [on the weekend]. He’s a really exceptional hitter and that’s what we expect from him.”
Out of the bullpen, junior Garrett Rupp gave up just one unearned run in three innings of relief work. Along with the rotation, Rupp and the bullpen are tasked with providing year-long consistency for the Crimson.
HARVARD 13, LAFAYETTE 1
Harvard scored four times in the first two innings and posted crooked numbers in the fifth and eighth innings en route to a season-opening 13-1 blowout over Lafayette.
Robinson drove in four on 3-for-5 hitting, while leadoff hitter Hoffman reached three times on three singles and added a stolen base.
Sophomore righty Simon Rosenblum-Larson pitched seven innings of quality one-run ball with nine K’s to complete the team effort.
“It’s just about having the same consistent week of preparation,” said Rothenberg, speaking on replicating this weekend’s success in the team’s upcoming jam-packed Spring Break trip to Florida. “When we get there, taking it game-by-game is the best way to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After ten minutes, the game looked all but over. Three quarters later, the Harvard women’s basketball team had pushed its opponent, Princeton, to the brink with a second half flurry, falling just short, 64-60, at Lavietes Pavilion.
The Crimson (20-6, 8-5 Ivy) put in its worst quarter of the season to start the game, but rode a couple of hot hands in a scintillating second half to fray the nerves of the most optimistic of Tigers (15-10, 9-3) fans. With the result, Harvard will be either the third seed at next weekend’s inaugural Ivy League tournament and will face Princeton again on Saturday.
“I love my team, I was very proud of the second half,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We cut the lead with pure fight. But, why do you have to wait to do that? This is Princeton. This is who we’re going to play next weekend. And they show up like that? I don’t understand that. Shame on [my players].”
A dreadful opening exchange sunk the hosts. Freshman point guard Katie Benzan scored the Crimson’s first five points of the game, and after a 6-0 run by the Tigers to open up a 10-5 lead, freshman center Jeannie Boehm and captain Destiny Nunley hit back-to-back layups to cut the lead to one.
From there, it all fell apart as Princeton scored 14 straight points to end the quarter. Leading scorer Bella Alarie, Benzan’s primary competition for Ancient Eight rookie of the year, was at the heart of things with five points and two assists during that run. The downtrodden hosts’ fortunes were exemplified best by the final 40 seconds; following a layup by Tigers guard Vanessa Smith, sophomore guard Madeline Raster threw the ball out of bounds allowing Princeton another possession, from which Smith hit a buzzer-beating jumper off the glass.
It wasn’t just luck, however; Harvard was dreadful defensively, allowing its opponents to shoot 10-of-14 in the first quarter and made just 4-of-17 field goals in the period. On one possession, Nunley missed a layup and then allowed her defensive assignment Alarie, who had a team-high 16 points, to hit an uncontested triple. The Crimson failed to match the Tigers’ physicality early on.
“We were really, really soft, there wasn’t an ounce of toughness in the first quarter,” Delaney-Smith said. “No one on my team wanted to score expect Katie Benzan. She’s it. She’s the only one who moved and tried to make things happen. Everyone else just stood around.”
Harvard’s apparent hangover continued into the second quarter, with Princeton complacent to maintain its lead and the hosts unable to kickstart the offense. An even period ended at 11 apiece, giving the Tigers a 35-20 halftime advantage.
“We definitely [lacked] fight and heart,” sophomore guard Sydney Skinner said, “Which is disappointing for a team so deep in the season to have our coach tell us that we weren’t playing with heart. When she said that, we all woke up and realized we needed to start playing.”
After a 6-0 blitz by Princeton to start the second half—giving the visitors their largest lead of the game at 21—the Crimson finally settled down and grew into the game. With the score at 41-25, Raster caught on fire, hitting back-to-back-to-back three pointers, including a four-point play. Her individual 10-5 run cut the deficit to 14 with five minutes remaining.
“[Raster] was a deer in headlights in the first half,” Delaney-Smith said, “And then she was tremendous in the second half.”
After an Alarie layup, it was Skinner’s turn to bring Harvard back into the game. She went on a 9-2 run of her own, one that included three driving layups and three hard-earned free throws, to make it a 50-41 game. After another Alarie triple, sophomore Kelsey Bogdan, playing just her seventh game of the season, came off the bench with a three of her own to keep the game within nine heading into the fourth quarter.
After a barren run by both teams to open the final period, a Benzan three cut the lead to five, 58-53, with just under four minutes remaining. The two teams traded buckets and free throws before a Raster three cut the lead to three with 47 seconds left, part of her team-high 16 points.
After Nunley got a steal on the following possession, the Tigers fouled Boehm to send Harvard’s worst statistical free throw shooter to the line with the game on the line. Boehm hit the first but couldn’t make the second, and a pair of Alarie free throws in the final seconds sealed the defeat.

We know Rihanna and Viola Davis have come and gone, but don’t fret—we have a new celebrity on campus. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana’s fame has soared in recent weeks since he became the face of Harvard’s new meme group, a Facebook page titled “Harvard Memes for 1% Elitist Tweens.”
 Khurana, who is known on the page simply as ‘Kesh,’ has had his face photoshopped onto a wide variety of figures including Ke$ha and Spongebob Squarepants.
“Rakesh me ousside, how bow dah,” reads one post.
“You have been visited by HBS ’Kesh of the abyss,” reads another. “Psets and transformative experiences will come to you.”
Flyby sat down with Khurana to see how he is handling his newfound popularity. The Dean seemed unconcerned.
“I predict in the future everyone will have a meme about them,” Khurana said in an interview Friday. “It’s like kind of a version of Andy Warhol’s fifteen minutes, everybody will be a meme at some point in their life.”
We can’t wait for our turn—we’re sure it’ll be a “transformative experience.”

Whether you’re an avid fan or a vocal protester of the show, you’ve probably seen The Bachelor at least once. Two hours a week of symmetric-faced individuals all aggressively pining after a complete stranger—what’s not to like? The only thing that could make the series better is getting as sloshed as all its contestants constantly are. Although this season's almost over, this drinking game will survive longer than the “relationship” between Nick and whichever girl he winds up picking. While you’re getting pissed off at one of the annoying contestants (we’re looking at you, Corinne), why not get piss drunk as well? 
Take a Drink Every Time:One of the following adjectives is used to describe a contestant or Bachelor/ette—sincere, amazing, intelligent, sexy, attractive, incredible, or any non-specific adjective that could be applied to anyone. Take a longer swig if the Bachelor/ette uses the exact same adjectives to describe more than one contestant.
A contestant gives a back-handed compliment to another contestant or about another contestant in one of the confessional scenes. The faker it seems, the longer you should drink.
Someone is convinced they’re the one not getting the rose that week. They usually agonize over the prospect in tears (see below) in a confessional style interview right before they *gasp* get a rose.
Take a Shot:Every time someone starts crying. One shot per manicured eye-dropped tear roll. If it’s unconvincing and unnecessary, take two.
If the Bachelor/ette kisses two or more different contestants with no commercial breaks in between. Multiple makeout seshes in an uninterrupted airing means pound that vodka.
Finish Your Drink:If a contestant says anything about being in love with the Bachelor/ette, which includes a wide range from “I think I’m really falling for him…” to straight up “I’m in love with you.”
If your least favorite contestant goes home at the end of the episode, finish your drink.
Follow these “rules” and you’ll hopefully be absolutely smashed by the end of the excruciatingly drawn-out episode. If you’re marathoning it, make sure to rent out a bed in UHS and phone in the amnesty policy ahead of time. Happy drinking!

You’ve definitely heard of the Belltower suite. As a matter of fact, you’ve probably even been there, and forgot about it the next morning. It’s finally time to learn about the rest of this fabulous house. It’s fine if you can barely pronounce the name; Pforzheimer’s pfeatures will have you knowing you won the Housing Lottery. Massage chairs? Quad Grille? Duplexes, n+1 housing, and hallway singles—oh my! This Quad house will make the shuttle ride to class more than worth it.
Sophomores in Pfoho aren’t sequestered to one part of the house, so if you’re getting tired of your peers, don’t fret. There’s an abundance of sophomores in Moors Hall and on certain floors of Comstock and Holmes, but if you’re one of the blessed and are allotted a dorm in the Jordans, say hello to the most recently remodeled rooms in Pfoho with attached kitchenettes.
Pfoho House Committee co-chair Mo Kim ’18 has ~statistically analyzed~ the housing situation, and estimates that when at capacity—a cozy 387 people—sophomores have about a 95% chance of getting better than n-1 housing. Future Pfoho-sers, if your horoscope said anything about space to grow as a person, this is what it meant. Connected singles, baby! From there on, it just gets better. Juniors and seniors enjoy duplexes that are comfortable enough to host small ragers but still have some personal space when the common room gets too gross (read: full of freshmen) to hang out in.
Speaking of party suites, Pfoho is (pfo)home (we know, it’s both catchy and disturbing) to the infamous Belltower suite in Moors Hall, identifiable all through the Quad at night by its strobe lighting and, well, the belltower it’s in. The Belltower is the biggest suite in the house, and actually has its own separate lottery process. It comes with huge windows—great for its sweaty parties—and a gorgeous view. If you’re not a fan of this Quad party staple, however, Pfoho’s Igloo is a cool alternative for a less intense event.
If there’s one thing that Pfoho takes as seriously as its overuse of the ‘pf’ joke, it’s building a strong community. They have countless cool programs to take advantage of. Weekly Pfoho Fridays are happy hours with catered food from Harvard Square classics, so you won’t have to miss Felipe’s or the Kong. Sign up for Pfull English Breakfasts, and join the faculty deans for a meal that’s worth waking up for on Saturday mornings. In the most hipster move ever, Pfoho has also recently adopted the Danish tradition of Hygge in the form of low-key fireside chillin’.
As for parties, the HoCo-organized Nineties Dance is getting more popular by the year. Put on your overalls and your crop tops, because people actually do show up in costumes for this fall event. If you want to take reliving the embarrassing past to a new level, Pfoho also hosts the Middle School Talent Show, where people pretend to be their pre-teen selves and perform seriously or for fun.
For the outdoorsy folk, House-funded Pfoho Pforays take you out of the Quad and into the wild, with past trips including ice skating, corn mazes, and deep-sea fishing. You’ll never have to complain about the Harvard bubble again.
What’s your favorite memory of your house?
Mo Kim ‘18: I would say, for me, sitting at Hygge next to the fireplace, and just seeing someone whose face I’ve seen before, and then just talking to them and realising we’ve been there for two hours. The event ends at ten, but they leave the fireplace on, so I’ve definitely had a lot of times when I’ve talked to someone and then been like, “Oh, it’s eleven and everyone’s gone.” Pfoho feels like a place [where] it’s very easy to make those organic connections.
What three words would you use to describe your house?
MK: Warm, eventful, supportive… I would probably add outdoorsy.
What’s one thing you want freshmen to know about your house?
MK: I think what I’d tell them is that, for one thing this is going to be your home away from home. And second, that a lot of freshmen don’t immediately feel included in the house, but at least in Pfoho, we want you to have ownership over this community. This community is shaped by you, and you get to define what it means for you. So, I think that’s really where our strength as a community lies, that people care—a lot. And that we also as an administration, with the faculty, we give students the space to shape house life the way they want it to be.
If you had to compare your Faculty Deans to any superheroes, which would they be and why?
MK: Wonder Woman and Thor. Anne does so much, I have no idea how she’s so busy and also such a good person. And then John is very charming, the same way a Norse mythical god is.
What Hogwarts House would you liken your house to?
MK: I would say Hufflepuff. In a lot of ways we’re a pretty dorky house, but we wear it on our sleeve.
If Pfoho were a fruit, which one would it be and why?
MK: I would say a mango. It’s a very bold, colorful fruit, but then you bite into it and it’s very sweet.
