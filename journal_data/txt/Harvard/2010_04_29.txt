After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
South Park, an animated show on Comedy Central, tests the boundaries of free speech on a regular basis. From depicting a beheaded Britney Spears to portraying live festive Christmas feces named Mr. Hankey, the show constantly offends every subset of society to provide social commentary on perceived injustices and logically flawed, but widely accepted, ideas.
Yet South Park’s recent 200th episode, which includes a depiction of the prophet Muhammad, may have finally crossed the line of what Comedy Central is willing to air. After the premiere of the first part of the two-part episode, in which the prophet Muhammad was depicted in a bear costume, the Islamic community expressed concerns about the next episode, that claimed to contain a full characterization of the alleged prophet Muhammad. The network, after numerous objections, decided to censor the second episode and did not allow it to air. Comedy Central made the right decision by choosing to protect the lives of its employees over maintaining free speech.
After the first episode aired, Abu Talhah Al-Amrikee wrote on his blog that the show “outright insulted” the prophet, adding: “We have to warn [the producers] that what they are doing is stupid, and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show.” Though he claimed it was just a warning, not a threat, by comparing the producers of South Park to the Dutch filmmaker who was killed for his film criticizing Islam’s treatment of women, Al-Amrikee did indeed threaten the lives of the producers. In addition, radical group Revolution Muslim posted the addresses of Comedy Central’s offices on its website, thus endangering the employees of the network.
When considering what happened in the cases of the Danish cartoonist who is now in hiding after depicting the prophet Muhammad and van Gogh’s murder, the writers of South  Park and the employees of Comedy Central were under especially salient and imminent threats from radical Islamic activists. Therefore, although the only sort of speech that should be fundamentally outlawed is hate speech—which this episode theoretically did not include—Comedy Central made the right decision in choosing not to further endanger its employees by airing the episode.
Although we agree that Comedy Central made the right choice in censoring itself, we hope that the media continues to fight for free speech. News channels in particular should be held to a higher standard of not acquiescing to threats, for their power to disperse information is particularly necessary.
Indeed, the bigger issue here is not Comedy Central’s decision but instead is the use of threats—grounded in religion or any other belief—to subdue another’s free speech. In a statement to the New York Times, South Park’s creators commented, “In the 14 years we’ve been doing ‘South  Park’ we have never done a show that we couldn’t stand behind.” The repression of free speech due to threats of violence is regrettable and unjustified. Our hope is that South  Park continues to provide satirical social commentaries and that the decision between safety and freedom should never have to be made again.

“Sophomoric, gross, and unfunny,” decried Hal Boedeker of the Seattle Times, “Its chances for success die each time Kenny does,” he waxed oracular. “Carnivalesque,” reporter Ethan Thompson declared, imputing to “South Park” a brand of clever satire with a literary tradition.
South Park is equal parts offensive and sacrilegious. Its content repulses some and elicits uncomfortable laughter from others who don’t know whether to publicly condemn the racial rhetoric its creators so frequently employ or privately snicker at its irreligious themes. But in its smutty humor is the principle of free speech incarnate, the belief that all speech that does not actively encourage violence, no matter how profane or offensive, should be protected.
Comedy Central’s decision to censor South Park is antithetical to that very idea, and the argument that its decision was in the interest of safety despoils the spirit of free speech that protects all types of comedy, no matter how sophomoric, gross, or unfunny we deem it. South Park’s creators are no strangers to death threats and have offended every major world religion, ethnic identity, and sexual identity conceivable. They have surely been menaced by some radical fringe representing these groups.
The idea that free speech is only a right worth protecting when it is safe or convenient to do so is as dangerous as the threats of terrorism that the South Park creators face. To ignore that by substituting defense of that right with just a condemnation of violence is not only laughably impotent as a counter to terrorism, but also a legitimation of the threat itself. Indeed, the South Park controversy cast into stark light the conflict between terrorism and the freedoms that we in America hold dear, and in this case, terrorism prevailed.
Detractors of what may seem like a romanticized argument in favor of airing an offensive episode might point to the fact that people associated with the creators of the show were under threat, or that the possibility of dying for being a humorist is unfair. But these people miss the fact that the very exercise of free speech meets with danger—the danger that one will be oppressed by some influence, whether vigilante violence or state power. The moment when we are unwilling to protect the rights of our fellow because of possible violence against him or those around him, we sacrifice free speech as a right and relegate it to a privilege of convenience.
Similarly, the contention that humor’s right to free speech should not be protected but that news or some purely informational medium should enjoy that special protection is an unnecessary and specious privileging of one form of expression over another. Rights are indiscriminate and should not be subject to the weak claim that the work of a Pryor, Carlin, Wilde, or Maher is a lower form of speech than journalism. Much like other types of expression, there is valuable humor and humor that is less so—but all of it deserves to be protected.
Muslims should be offended that Matt Stone and Trey Parker would even dare to consider depicting Muhammad—it is blasphemous according to Islamic law. But taking offense is not the sole province of religion or religious persons, and South Park has committed egregious transgressions against people of various religious convictions, political beliefs, and identities. The fact that this offense is expressly prohibited by a group’s holy text should require delicacy and courtesy on the individual level—not an exception to our principles. Just as law should not supercede certain religious traditions, as laws in France threaten to do by forcing Muslim women not to wear burkas, religious sentiments should demand sensitivity from society, not coerce obedience through violence.

To the editors:
As a citizen of Northern Ireland, I was troubled by the assessment of Irish-American involvement in the peace process in Melinda Kuritzky and Brendan Rivage-Seul’s article “Lessons in Peacemaking” (Mar. 22, 2010). I agree that Northern Ireland can be an example to Israelis and Palestinians, but I also believe it should caution America and its powerful Diaspora groups.
The United States played a vital role in the Good Friday Agreement and the affection Irish Americans hold for their patrimony is gratifying. Nonetheless, it is not always healthy or helpful. For 40 years prior to 9/11, the most munificent global funder of terrorism was not Iran or Iraq but the U.S.  Irish-American organizations channeled millions of dollars into the Irish Republican Army, extremists responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocents—both Catholic and Protestant—as well as soldiers and police, in the north, south, and the British mainland. Lured by hand-me-down sentiment, Irish Americans unwittingly paid for every soldier killed, every “traitor” disappeared, every British city center bombed, and every brutal sectarian arms race. For too many victims’ families on our islands, the road to hell has been paved with American good intentions. Al-Qaeda has never been lauded at Buckingham Palace—the same cannot be said for the IRA and the White House.
Northern Ireland belongs to the people of all its communities and its destiny is theirs to decide. However kind your intentions, if you were born in Riverside, Calif., or Milton, Mass., you do not understand the intricacies of our situation. In truth, as the product of a mixed-faith family with victims on both sides, my own understanding is conflicted. The Irish, northern and southern, are proud of our diaspora: We value our connectivity and we like to see you visiting, but we don’t believe for a moment you know a hill of beans about the truth of our province or its problems.  And when you’ve tried to apply what you think you know, you’ve actually caused us more harm than good.  Sometimes in life, the best way of showing your affection is to keep your distance. It applies to Northern Ireland and Irish Americans, and it is a lesson self-proclaimed Jewish-American experts on the Middle East might note.

To the editors:
Kudos to Daniel E. Herz-Roiphe for publishing “Long Overdue” (Apr. 15, 2010) on the gender division within Harvard’s social scene.  It is a topic that affects the life of almost every undergraduate, directly or indirectly, but has never been written about during my time at Harvard (and particularly, not by someone who is a member of an all-male final club himself). Although I am grateful that someone has initiated this debate, there are two points that ought to be given further consideration.
While Harvard’s social resources certainly give women short shrift—a point cleanly illustrated by the fact that eight females final clubs with multi-million dollar properties are unlikely to exist in the near future, the article inadvertently marginalizes women. Harvard women (or at least those whom I have had the privilege to meet) do not exist in a constant state of fear that they will be excluded; nor do they maintain friendships and/or initiate relationships, as Herz-Roiphe suggests, in order to stay on the guest list for upcoming parties. The very growth of women’s final clubs and sororities, as well as the rising numbers of elected female leaders, is a testament to the resilience of women’s organizations in the face of unequal resources.
The role of final club members also deserves a closer evaluation: The University has put unbelievable pressure on final clubs to function as campus-wide social venues, forcing their presidents to take on enormous personal liability and their members to shoulder the large financial burdens associated with hosting weekly social events. Physically, final clubs were not built to host campus-wide events that could accommodate the same number of students as House dining halls, the old Student Union (now the Barker Center) or even the old Hasty Pudding Theatre (now mainly classrooms). In this sense, the University has placed final clubs in an unreasonable position and increased the very exclusiveness that the school rightfully discourages. The possibility of “open” social events is impossible due to liability, cost, and space. By actively preventing other social alternatives, the University has empowered the very system of gender imbalance that it created and made institutions that were not intended to be a default social option to function as such.
Nonetheless, Herz-Roiphe is willing to confront a topic that so many avoid and makes a compelling point that the gender divide at Harvard ought to be re-evaluated and rectified. I simply hope that we do not victimize women or vilify final club members in conducting this debate.

We’ve been had. On April 13, Behzad Soltani, deputy director of Iran’s Atomic Commission, proclaimed, “Iran will join the world nuclear club within a month.” Granted, Iranian leadership is prone to hyperbole and this could just be Tehran posturing to disrupt President Obama’s Nuclear Security Summit. Regardless, we should be very concerned. We have spent the last six years in a futile cycle of proffered carrots and brandished sticks with the Iranian government. If we are to learn from our relations with North Korea, then this time we have to pick either the carrot or the stick and make it big, before it is too late.
Even before Soltani’s boast, indications that Iran was nearing operational nuclear arms have been growing stronger in the last few months.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unveiled on April 9 a revamped centrifuge capable of enriching uranium at faster speeds that, according to the State Department, would be unnecessary for peaceful nuclear power. The Arak heavy water plant and the Bushehr atomic reactor, both almost completed, could combine to produce dangerous quantities of plutonium for nuclear warheads. Furthermore, according to the “Weekly Standard,” a thus far unreleased report by the International Atomic Energy Agency documents that Iran was recently testing sophisticated weapons technology for nuclear warheads.
What is particularly threatening about the reality of an Iran with nuclear weapons is its relationships with half a dozen terrorist groups. Whereas North Korea, or even Soviet Russia, would more likely and more rationally avoid mutually assured destruction, a radical zealot is liable to attack an American city without regard to his or her future.
The pieces for today’s quagmire began to fall into a place after the election of Ahmadenijad in 2005. Iran resumed uranium conversion that year and since then has been on a steady path toward developing nuclear power capability. A National Intelligence Estimate provided their infamously hopeful report in 2007 that declared Iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003. However, that report has since been discredited based on its narrow-minded focus on the actual designing of weapons. As the world prepares for a nuclear-armed Iran, it has become clearer that Iran’s trajectory towards achieving that status has been remarkably direct.
The United  States’ diplomatic relations with Iran over this time have been a series of blunders characterized by a cycle of ineffective sanctions and weak peace offerings. Furthermore, the U.S. has set countless deadlines, only to have them ignored with minimal punishment.
For instance, in March of 2005, President Bush decided to offer economic incentives including membership in the World Trade Organization to Iran if they agreed to abandon their desire for nuclear power. A year later, after Iran had successfully enriched uranium, the United States, working multilaterally with Britain and France, threatened Iran with harsher actions if they failed to suspend their uranium enrichment. Then, only a few weeks later, the U.S. retracted the stick and presented the carrot offering to engage in direct talks with Iran if it agreed to abandon its uranium enrichment program.
The United  States’ primary strategy in attempting to rein in Iran has been economic sanctions. Unfortunately, these sanctions have had only a small effect on the Iranian economy as evidenced by the growth in its 2008 GDP by a strong 6.4 percent.
While the United States has been implementing sharper trade sanctions, the economies of Germany, China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates have reaped the benefits of a larger share of Iranian trade. President Obama recognizes that in order to provide truly effective economic sanctions they must be multilateral and, most importantly, include China and Russia.  He has recently discussed economic sanctions with both Chinese President Hu Jintao and Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. Both nations have proven unreliable on this issue in the past and furthermore, if Iran is truly only a month, or perhaps months, from developing nuclear warheads, then even economic sanctions from every developed nation would be rendered irrelevant.
Likewise, offering positive incentives to Iran may be too little too late at this stage in its development of nuclear technology. Of course, I am not advocating that we all start singing renditions of “Bomb Iran,” but military action should not be disallowed on principle. In fact, I would argue that our reliance on soft power without the implicit threat of true hard power is the fundamental reason why both North Korea and Iran have comfortably duped us.
President Obama must either immediately convince international leaders that a nuclear-armed Iran is a grave danger to international security and implement broader economic sanctions, or plan for military action. Or we can continue to stutter through weak narrow trade restrictions while providing excuses until Iran finally joins the nuclear club.  Let’s hope Obama chooses one of the first two actions—our safety depends on it.

Politics aside, it is hard to deny that Obama is a captivating orator. After eight years of perplexed eyebrows and blank teleprompter gazes, Obama’s rhetorical aptitude feels as refreshing as a good night’s sleep after an all-nighter. Anyone who has seen him speak has felt the rapture of his pathos, ethos, and logos melting together in his inspiring words.
Nevertheless, time and time again Obama’s speeches are chopped to still-pulsing pieces by intermittent and blatantly partisan insertions of needless applause. Jarring ejaculations of editorializing slowly suck the lifeblood out of captivation, and the more they appear, the more I find this trend both frustrating and deeply frightening. For how can we be swept away by anything when audiences are constantly grabbing for coattails to ride on, in desperate attempts to bask in another’s glory while contributing nothing of their own but noise and disturbance?
The tendency to comment on another’s performance in medias res spans across cultures and genres of entertainment. It is as if the audience, and not the actors, are breaking the fourth wall by throwing bricks at it. What noisy senators do to the State of the Union is comparable to a diaper commercial right after a murder on your favorite TV show: a grating, sobering reminder that you are only watching a performance and not truly experiencing it. Because we only understand laissez faire as it applies to economics, viewers cannot lose themselves in the act. Never mind what the performers want to convey; nothing speaks for itself.
But all is not lost: Consider why concerts, sports events, and shows are all more expensive to watch live than on TV. Part of the price pays for the bragging rights of having seen some hero of yours in the flesh. But there has to be more, for why is good close-up footage still less appetizing than nosebleed seats? The answer: Seeing events live brings the show alive. Good performances dissolve the space between self and other, so individuals can immerse themselves in experience rather than in deflating rejoinders and side notes.
Unfortunately, not everyone has the opportunity to attend live shows. But if events must be broadcast, the experience of them should be transmitted through the media they employ, along with their simple images and sounds. High-definition screens are a wonderful step in this direction. But sports commentators, for example, can be a step in the other direction, as they often add little to no information crucial to one’s understanding of the game. Their commentary tends to pale in comparison to the sweat of athleticism they feel the need to pick apart from their leather seats in the climate-controlled press box.
Why not, then, make commentary optional? At this point, to avoid grating commentary we flip between channels broadcasting the same event, but all this offers is our pick of interpretation, when the real interpreters should be ourselves. Why shouldn’t we be able to choose if we want to hear commentary at all? What if announcers only spoke during halftime and time-outs, as one friend would realistically turn to another only during a lull in the action? We could lose ourselves in the experience of the game much more easily without constant prattle, whether it’s that of a non-stop announcer or the guy who won’t shut up in the row behind you at the stadium.
In many ways, it is too late to turn the tide on this trend entirely. No worldwide mandate could restrain the cheers of spectators. Yet we must allow ourselves to be swept away by something, or we shackle ourselves to the degrees of separation between pure enjoyment and irony. Anyone who feels even a modicum of outrage should make a personal commitment to lengthen our cultural attention span and let powerful performances speak for themselves. For there is an important difference between choosing how you want to experience an event and preventing yourself from experiencing it at all. Every now and then, a willing suspension of disbelief is, like chicken soup, good for the soul.

To the editors:
I write regarding U.S. aid to Israel is largely in the form of military aid, in response to the Crimson Staff editorial “Stepping Back” (Apr. 1, 2010). It consists of America giving money to Israel for its defense on the condition that Israel buys from American industries. Hence, U.S. aid to Israel is a way for the U.S. government to stimulate its own economy by making Israel purchase from the American defense sector.
If the Crimson Staff wants to talk about using aid in accordance with American principles, then it should first propose that the U.S. reconsider the aid it gives to Arab countries. This aid is given without setting conditions on the Arab governments to adopt true democratic ideals, follow the rule of law, respect women, support gay rights, and observe basic liberties such as freedom of the press—these are all principles shared by America and Israel. Therefore, the Crimson Staff should first suggest that the U.S. reconsider its aid to Saudi Arabia if it is truly committed to the ideals that the U.S. is supposed to uphold.
Whether due to some oversight or hypocrisy, the Crimson Staff has focused its attention on Israel’s shortcomings, applying a double standard to Israel, without making similar claims regarding how the U.S. should use its influence on other countries in the region. There are gays being stoned to death in Egypt; there are roads that are accessible only to Muslims in Saudi Arabia; Jordan recently revoked Jordanian citizenship from some 3,000 Palestinians (I do not recall the Obama administration making a strong public condemnation of this injustice, nor the Crimson Staff demanding the U.S. to pressure the Jordanian government). Instead, the Crimson Staff simply says that if the U.S. distances itself from Israel, it might “foster our relationships with its neighbors.” Foreign policy cannot survive a double standard.
More appalling is the Crimson’s Staff sole criticism of Israel because its settlement policies “undercut the peace process” while blatantly omitting the serious lack of commitment from the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank toward peace. Hamas in Gaza uses terrorism and fires rockets, hiding cowardly among human shields; Hamas is targeting Israeli civilians and putting their own civilians at risk, thereby committing a crime against humanity on two accounts. Hamas has a greater desire to see Israel destroyed rather than to help Palestinians in Gaza. In the West Bank, the “more moderate” Mahmoud Abbas recently gave his strong approval for the naming of a square after a suicide bomber terrorist (Dalal Mughrabi) who was responsible for the deaths of 37 innocent Israeli civilians. What perverse culture is this that glorifies death, the killing of innocent civilians, and incites hatred? I wonder if the Crimson Staff would similarly propose that the U.S. should reconsider its aid to the Palestinian Authority if its leaders continue to foment hatred. For the Crimson Staff to accuse Israel and its settlements for hurting peace efforts while forgetting the ideology of vitriolic hate and terror that is present among Palestinians is a shameful omission.
There is no moral equivalency between Israel, a free and democratic country in which every citizen is equal under the law, and Israel’s neighbors, which are theocracies and dictatorships. Israel conducts its military operations in self-defense to secure its civilians and targeting terrorists while minimizing civilian casualties. Indeed, British Colonel Richard Kemp said, “The IDF did more to safeguard the rights of civilians in a combat zone than any other army in the history of warfare” regarding Operation Cast Led. I will add that instead of distancing from Israel, the U.S. might even learn a few things from Israel on how to conduct itself morally during war against militants.
The issue of building settlements needs to be addressed in a plan that will bring long lasting peace and security to Israelis and Palestinians. So too must the problem of terrorism and the message of hate that still comes out loudly from the Palestinian side in Gaza and the West Bank be addressed. At least if the Crimson Staff wants the U.S. to reconsider its aid to Israel, then I hope they will stand by their alleged principles and also ask for a reconsideration of aid to Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority in the name of peace, freedom, democracy, and other American ideals.

To the editors:
I read with interest the Apr. 12 op-ed "Harvard Oppresses the Mentally Ill” by Christopher Mejo.
I was sorry to learn of the difficulties faced by Mr. Mejo, a sophomore at the Harvard Extension School, and admittedly, I cannot speak to his experience in seeking academic accommodations. However, I am writing to strongly protest his assertion, in his title no less, that Harvard, as an institution, "oppresses the mentally ill."
In a world in which quality, affordable mental healthcare is hard to come by, Harvard students truly get the best of the best.  When I was a freshman here, I had my first serious bout of mental illness.  My freshman resident dean at the time, as well as the excellent clinicians at University Health Services, showed me a level of care I have never seen anywhere else.  Moreover, because of the excellent school insurance, I was able to get all the care I needed, including weeks in McLean Hospital, a Harvard-affiliated psychiatric hospital that is consistently ranked #1 in the country, all free of charge.  During the worst time of my life, people in the Harvard community were there to help.  My mom often expresses her amazement at how wonderful the Harvard community has been to me.
Although each person's situation is different, I hope Mr. Mejo's article doesn't discourage Harvard students from seeking out help when they need it.  In addition to UHS Mental Health Services, there are many organizations and individuals who strive to make Harvard the best place possible for students struggling with mental illness.  If you think you need help, talk to one of your advisers (your proctor, your resident dean, etc.).  They can quickly put you in contact with assistance, no matter the hour.
Does Harvard oppress the mentally ill?  Absolutely not.  Trust me, I've been there.

It is with some disappointment that I opened your newspaper without eyeing any mention of the recent visit by the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, at Harvard. As former President of Harvard's Leadership Institute, I have observed your newspaper's willingness to cover some of the high-profile and exceptional individuals that our organization, and others too, have brought to campus. Unfortunately, for someone as notable as the Secretary of the Navy, there was no coverage provided, and I believe that deprives your readers (and the many attendees) of quality news. I hope the Crimson will continue to report on news that matters to Harvard community members.

Yesterday, I finally tripped.
I’m normally not a big fan of drugs. I was in Amsterdam for one day when I had to make a decision: to shroom or not to shroom? I decided against it. Sure, it was legal, but why see the dour, bike-filled city under the influence when I could get high off the beautiful colors of the Van Gogh paintings?
So when I heard about the taste-altering miracle fruit in an article in The New York Times, I thought it was a fantastic joke at first. A dangerous one. A naturally occurring fruit that makes all sour foods taste sweet? Was this even legal?
Miracle berries, originally from West Africa, look like cranberries but contain a protein called miraculin. It’s unclear exactly how it works, but after binding to taste receptors, sour flavors morph into sweetness. Sour cream tastes like sweet cream. Fine wine tastes like Manischewitz. Butterscotch candy tastes like a heart attack. This lasts anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour.
There are uses to the fruit other than for curious college students looking to “flavor trip.” It’s one way for diabetics to taste sweetness without the corresponding insulin spike, for example. But a lot of press has centered around the flavor tripping parties being held in large cities where guests wanted to experience altered states of palate.
I’ve spent a few years in suspense, but I’d waited too long. This was one drug I actually had to try. I headed to the home for all things freakish to find out: the Internet. Freeze-dried berries cost $2.20 per berry, a steep fee for something as big as my pinky nail. Since I was helping organize a flavor-tripping party for the Harvard Culinary Society, I ordered 25. As I typed in my credit card number, I felt like I was being scammed. This was still too strange of a concept to wrap my mind around—would this even work?
They came in a small white box, still cold to the touch. I stored them in a Quincy freezer and hoped that I hadn’t left them in the mailroom too long.
Then the time of reckoning came. I ran to pick up the berries, still skeptical that the entire thing could be pulled off. Guests began arriving and milled around the tables set up with lemons, limes, grapefruit, goat cheese, apples, salt and vinegar chips, hot sauce, white vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and mustard.
It was perhaps one of the weirdest party spreads I had ever seen.
I instructed everyone to take a plate of food to do a pretasting. Then another organizer passed out a single, frozen berry to each guest. We popped them into our mouths together on cue, chewing the fruit and keeping it there for two minutes.
The fruit itself didn’t taste like much—a bit of tang, slightly sweet.
I had a sudden moment of fear. What if I’d left the berries in the mailroom for too long? What if I’d ordered them from a scam website? I’d never actually tried this before myself.
But then I took a bite of a lemon. Then a lime. They tasted positively...sweet. Like candy.
Euphoria overtook me. I began shoveling everything within sight into my mouth. Judging from other people’s reactions, they felt the same way.
My tongue had become a test tube for a chemistry experiment. The salt and vinegar chips had sweetened and lost their puckery bite. The most dramatic changes were the vinegars—the balsamic was as cloyingly sweet as syrup, and the white vinegar was a confusing combination of saccharine flavor and acidic burn, with the unmistakable smell thrown in. (All that acid still has an effect, even if you can’t taste it.) Goat cheese tasted like cheesecake.
I spooned Tabasco into my mouth. A long, sweet peppery sizzle.
But for pure tastiness, the lemons, limes, and grapefruits proved the most popular. Within a few minutes, the entire platter of citrus had disappeared as people happily sucked the juicy lemon wedges and found that grapefruit didn’t taste like diet food after all. After the food had been eaten and cleared away, relief washed over me. It had worked.

Every year, hundreds of underage and barely legal prefrosh invade Harvard’s campus, popping up everywhere from upper-level economics classes to hallway bathrooms to final club parties. While last year’s prefrosh weekend featured a stolen cop car, this year’s weekend definitely proved a little tamer. FM’s Roving Reporter popped over to Sunday afternoon’s Activities Fair at the SOCH to catch up with some potential members of the class of 2014, getting them to dish on everything from intense grinding sessions at Jollies to what schools they’re still deciding between. Don’t play, 2014. You know you want to be here.
Ryan W. Dominiani, New Jersey; Hannah M. Barron, Eugene, Ore.; Ian F. Anderson, Stowe, Vt.; Ryan W. Chandler, Savannah, Ga.
Roving Reporter: Did you party this weekend?
Ryan W. Dominiani: [pauses] I mean, should I answer that truthfully?
RR: Yes, we won’t publish it otherwise.
RWD: Oh. So...yes.
RR: Where are you choosing between?
RWD: Here and Princeton.
Ian F. Anderson: I got into Middlebury, but this is definitely my top choice.
RR: So tell me about the boys—are they hotter than you though they’d be?
Hannah M. Barron: Nah. [laughs] All hot guys are gay here.
RR: Amen, sister. And the girls?
IFA: I think that Harvard gets a bad rap. If you go on collegeprowler.com, it gives the girls here a B-.
RR: College prowler? That sounds like college porn.
Ryan W. Chandler: No! You’ve never heard of it before? It rates colleges unofficially on all these aspects, like food and chicks, etc. Like they gave Arizona State an A+ for girls, and that’s legit. But Harvard girls deserve more than a B-.
RR: So the girls are pretty cute then?
IFA: Yeah, I’d say so. Especially you.
RR: [Note to self. Get him to comp FM next semester.]
Daniel T. Speckhard, Athens, Greece and Michael G. Dinunzio, New York, N.Y.
RR: Daniel, how do you feel about coming to Harvard from Europe?
Daniel T, Speckhard: It’s far away. But I like how everyone is so down to earth. I thought they’d all be snotty. The nightlife is a downgrade from Greece, but it’s okay. I’m going to have to study a lot, right?
RR: Anything remarkable from this weekend?
Michael G. Dinunzio: People here dance pretty dirty. I was not expecting that. Especially at Jollies.
Kristine A. Maroti, Mount Kisco, N.Y. and Sandy U. Uwimana Rochester, N.Y.
RR: Did you go out this weekend?
Kristine A. Maroti: We went to Quincy and the Owl. It was kind of awkward if you don’t really know anyone there, but I did think some of the guys were pretty cute­­—a few I guess. I was pleasantly surprised.
Sandy U. Uwimana: My host was amazing. We did a lot of fun things­—she took me to Eleganza, and then we went to Jollies.
RR: What are you thinking of studying here?
SUW: I was thinking about going into medicine, but I’m not really positive.
KAM: It’s between physics, French and history. Harvard’s a good balance because people are doing a lot but they still seem to enjoy going out as well.
Jennifer Sung, Watchung, N.J.
RR: How was your host?
Jennifer Sung: She’s really nice, I haven’t seen her much. She’s really into the Korean Association so I think she’s been doing a lot for them. I’ve also been doing my own prefrosh thing.
Andre J. Gonzalez, Tampa, Fla.
RR: What have you been up to during your stay here?
Andre J. Gonzalez: Well, I went to Jollies last night. It was a lot of fun. The party scene is a lot bigger than I thought it would be, and there are some attractive prefrosh.
RR: Did you hook up with anyone?
AJG: No comment. What did you get up to last night?
RR: No comment.

Like an ideal love interest, short films are both seductive and accessible. Entries into the Harvard Shorts Film Festival, however, had a different set of criteria. The film submissions had to fall into one of three categories—“scholarly exploration,” “course and departmental trailers,” and “use of library resources”—and the winners, to be announced tomorrow, stand to receive up to $750 for their films.
Shigehisa Kuriyama, Reischauer Institute Professor of Cultural History, first envisioned the festival several years ago when he began assigning students to make short films for his class on the history of medicine. He was immediately struck by students’ engagement in the project and found that students would spend more time making the movies than they would have writing term papers.
Fascinated with the student reaction, he started using short films as weekly section assignments in Culture and Belief 11: “Medicine and the Body in East Asia and in Europe,” which he began teaching in Fall 2008. Students worked on the assignments with an enthusiasm that surprised Kuriyama. “They were no longer just for professors, but for classmates—that’s a very powerful thing,” he says. “You take good ideas and incorporate them into your own.”
As the festival’s website explains, the purpose of the competition is to enable students, faculty, and staff “to showcase the possibilities of this new medium, and to illustrate how creative artistic expression can be made integral to scholarly communication.”
SHORT and SWEET
“Why would anyone ever call someone a vegetable? It’s just a funny question,” says Latif F. Nasser, a second-year graduate student in History of Science, describing the inspiration behind the three-part scholarly short he submitted to the festival. The film explores the phenomenon of giving people labels as vegetables—for example, coma patients in vegetative states and bums as “coach potatoes.”
Nasser says that prior to taking the graduate-level equivalent of Kuriyama’s Culture and Belief 11 class, he had made a few short films, but did not have any real experience to speak of. Nonetheless, he found himself thrilled by his newfound cinematic ambitions. “It’s not that hard, which is wonderful. You get perfectionist and obsessive about certain things,” he says. “You can really lose yourself in it.”
“What’s really revolutionary about new media is its accessibility,” Kuriyama says. “It doesn’t take a high level of training and expensive equipment to do remarkable things, and that’s the power of it.” Kuriyama believes that the short films currently in production truly are “new media”—perhaps even a new genre. Although the short films may overlap with movie-making techniques, they are often made without movie cameras and actual footage. They sometimes have narration; sometimes they don’t. According to Kuriyama, they’re new, they’re accessible, and they’re easy.
Nasser agrees that the novelty and excitement of the short film makes it an appealing genre.
“People get excited about them,” he says. “There’s something about this—it’s like a haiku in a way. You have to boil down what you’re thinking about.”
DEPICTING A PASSION
Lina Verchery is getting her Master’s of Divinity in Buddhism, a topic she has been thinking about since her undergraduate days at McGill University in Montreal. Later encounters with Buddhism, including a month-long residency at a Buddhist monastery in Taiwan, fueled the passion she exhibits in her short film, “the Bird.”
Verchery was also inspired to create a film because of a class she took with Kuriyama, though she has more experience in filmmaking than many of the participants in the competition, as exhibited through her use of more advanced techniques such as stop animation.
Her short film, entered in the “Use of Library Resources” category, depicts a young girl who becomes fascinated with a bird she sees in a book of Buddhist paintings in Lamont. She proceeds to research on both Google and Hollis until she finds more about the mysterious picture. Finally satisfied, she exits Lamont to reflect on a bird she sees on the lawn.
Verchery says she wanted to show how “life inside the library should enhance life outside the library.”
But library research wasn’t the only aspect of Harvard life dramatized by the shorts. The festival featured trailers promoting several Harvard courses, which were intended to give students an immediate sense of the course and engender excitement.
“They were incredibly seductive,” says Ruth S. Lingford, Professor of the Practice of Animation at VES, who animated one of the festival entries in a different category. “You could also see how hot the professor is, as well.”
FILM and ACADEMIA
Zeke Mazur thinks that his wife and co-director, Aleksandra Makarova, a graduate student in Linguistics, should abandon her studies altogether to pursue her love for filmmaking. The two submitted a short scholarly film entitled “The Origins of Evil in Valentinian Agnosticism,” which explores one interpretation of “how worldly evil derived from the use of divine suffering.”
Although Mazur, a self-labeled “techno-skeptic,” enjoyed participating in the festival, he doubts that the new media represents the revolution in scholarly communication that Kuriyama suggests.
“Real scholarship is primarily discursive, in images and words,” he says. “Video technology has been around for a while. Film probably won’t replace the term paper. Visual presentations won’t replace the book.”
Though Mazur may doubt the grand significance of short video projects, Kuriyama remains adamant that visual presentations will be more than a teaching tool.
“In my personal view, this will not just be important for education, but also for the future of academics,” he says. “Through video, students and professors can harness power to reach to broader audiences with broader knowledge.”
Kuriyama hopes to continue the festival next year, though there are currently no definitive plans.
“No one has any sense of what the future will hold,” he says. “Really, it’s all about individual creativity.”

I’m sprinting down Garden Street, a little out of breath, laptop case bumping awkwardly at the hip. My eyes glanced sideways at Harvard Square’s all-knowing digital clock, checking the time and groaning inside. A meeting at Currier started five minutes ago and I live in Adams. “I...can...make...it,” I tell myself between inhales. Cambridge Common flies by.
Jay-jogging my way through the next stoplight, the SOCH is nearly within view. Using up that last ounce of Veritaffle-powered energy, I arrive and apologize profusely. As I catch my breath, the people I’m meeting grant their forgiveness and we get started. The thing is, the business of being late has become a habit of mine and this isn’t the first time it’s posed a problem.
The earliest incident of tardiness I can recall took place one otherwise clear and sunny morning in seventh grade. The school bus was pulling away, flashing its yellow backside as it lumbered over the hill a few blocks from my house. Though it had clearly come and was already leaving, I chased in pursuit, and the kindly driver took pity on me and put the behemoth of a vehicle in reverse, all the way to the bottom of the hill.
Catching the bus became a daily struggle, but my battle had just begun. In high school, I was late to first period, even the rallies I helped run. Friends would complain about delayed dinners, movie dates, and missed breakfasts. I would experience remorse on each occasion, but its effects would fade by the next day as I hit the snooze button or lost track of time. Although I knew it was wrong to keep people waiting and take up their time, I thought that others found the flaw endearing rather than annoying. Often, I would compensate by buying everyone bagels—carbs are, after all, always in high demand.
Before a recent group dinner party taking place at 6 p.m., one of my friends wrote, “For Li, it starts at 3:15.” While his message was meant to kid, his rationale for writing was serious. I had become known as “that girl,” used to rushing, running from place to place. Though I still experienced the pangs of guilt, I realized that this attitude, this flaw had become not just part of my life, but a major factor in it. I had no idea how I could change.
The solution seems simple—get a watch, wake up on time, and leave for things early instead of when they start. But like most problems that require intervention, a 12-step program oversimplifies matters. Despite an intent to engage in punctual behavior, my execution has continued to be lacking over the years.
Others have tried to catalyze action with mixed results. As a cabin counselor for fifth graders, I was once the target of an elaborate scheme by my 10-year-old campers who moved our cabin clock 15 minutes forward while I was sleeping. They were tired of getting to arts and crafts after all the good popsicle sticks had been claimed.
Despite the fact that those wilderness explorers were many years my junior, they had a precocious method to their madness. They recognized that missing out on the best materials during arts and crafts does no one any favors. As a tardy cabin leader, I wasn’t doing them any favors either.
Instead, I was falling into a perennial pattern I’d set for myself, one which subconsciously made me feel special because it was something others remembered me for. For six years now, going places on an extended version of Harvard time has been my trademark.
It’s a habit I’ve held onto because being late has always seemed easier than being on time, no matter how it affected those around me. Though people still joke about it and deem it an amusing quality, I’ve come to realize that it’s a characteristic I need to overcome to improve my relationships with those around me.
In many ways, this punctuality debacle has supplied me with a trove of comedic tales to relate about chasing down shuttles and dinner dates, stories I am known for. Three years after hanging out with those fifth graders, it’s time I start working towards being known for something that they can actually consider cool. Messing up their opportunity to build the most epic popsicle stick wigwam definitely does not fit the definition of that word.

Eric Carle, author and illustrator of children’s books including perennial best-seller “The Very Hungry Caterpillar,” spoke at the Graduate School of Education last Thursday. Now 81 years old, he recounted stories from his childhood in Germany during World War II and the role of that “world of grey” in forming his love for color. FM caught up with Carle for a few questions.
Fifteen Minutes: What were your favorite bugs or animals as a kid?
Eric Carle: I didn’t have a favorite. I just in general liked crawly things, looking under rocks watching ants. I remember my father explaining to me the life of bees. They all became my favorites.
FM: What can children teach us?
EC: Listen to them. That’s it. Listen to what they feel, what they wish for, what they’re afraid of.
FM: I understand you see the transition from the comfort of home to school as a scary time for children. How do you address this in your books?
EC: I hope that my books make it a little easier, make learning easier, whether that’s before the kids start school, after they’ve started school, or whenever they first encounter my books.
FM: What scared you as a child? What scares you now?
EC: What scared me were the bombs, being shot at in the war. What scares me now is the politics of this country. The two parties not getting along, being so hostile to each other.
FM: What inspires you?
EC: Beauty, art excites me. Simple things excite me. I have two houses; one is overlooking mountains, the Blue Ridge mountains. I can sit there for hours and just look at the hill. My other house is on the ocean; I can just look at the waves, the sunshine, the clouds. Things of that nature—they fulfill me and make me very happy.

With the Female Orgasm Seminar having already come and gone, many Harvard students are left wanting more. FM suggests some other seminars that might be equally fulfilling (hopefully this list is long enough to satisfy):
1. The Male Orgasm: This is an exclusively web-based seminar.
2. Surviving Assassins: It’s no fun getting caught in a Super Soaker’s line of fire when you’re not even playing.
3. Local Health Care Options: UHS is never going to help you.
4. Orgasms and Organisms: You actually have a hot lab partner in that OEB class. Now what?
5. Hostage Negotiation 101: When your roommate just won’t unlock the bathroom door.
6. How to Change a Light Bulb: Then the answer to that infamous question can be ‘one’. And so that you can graduate with at least one useful skill.
7. Prep School Fashion: For those of us with something to prove.
8. Art History Through the Ages: So your cocktail party banter is up to snuff.
9. The Art of Humility: Saying that you go to Harvard is a bad conversation starter. Especially at Harvard.
10. Social Interaction for Dummies: Or, how to drink vodka very, very quickly.
11. How to Cure a Hangover in 30 Minutes: The one seminar that will be useful for the rest of your life.
12. Pop Culture in the Time of Lady Gaga: Like this needs a reason.
13. The Upside to Incest: Admission rates are declining, so let’s keep it in the family.
14. Living with a Type-A Personality: You and your roommates should take this one.
15. Campus Hygiene Standards: We have better ways than body odor to get CNN’s attention (oh hai, MIT).

Molly M. Rooney ’11 faced a life-altering decision: would she be known as Squiggle, Squirt, Jelly Bean, Wiggles, or Bouncy? She was at the first meeting of Class Clowns this past Wednesday, a new club at Harvard that seeks to combine clowning and community service, and it was time for her to pick her clown name. Rooney, whose father was a clown, said that when she searched online for clown names starting with “M,” she found her own name, Molly. In the end, however, Rooney decided to throw out Molly for “Junebug,” chosen because she was born in June.
Nancy Chen ’13, treasurer of Class Clowns, had a harder time choosing. She considered “Kiki,” but thought better of it. “Will people think that’s my real name? Because it sounds Asian,” she said.
After the stressful process of choosing a clown name was finished, the newly minted clowns embarked on Balloon Animals 101—learning how to make dogs, then kangaroos and elephants (which are, practically speaking, dogs with different proportions), then flowers. Initially, many of the balloon animals died cruel and sudden deaths at the hands of the trainees, but skills began to improve.
In the midst of all the carnage, however, the focus remained on service. The club’s first service event was at Relay for Life this past Friday, and next year they plan to perform for children’s groups and at nursing homes. Pilar M. Mayora ’12, who attended circus school in Argentina between high school and college and now arranges performances for the club, has seen this side of clowning before. “My thing was always to make people happy, and being a clown is a good way to make people happy,” she said. Class Clowns adviser Michael A. Simon, known as the Associate Director of Harvard Hillel in some circles and “Flopsy” in others, agreed with this simple premise. “Students are involved in very serious activities here,” he said. “Here’s one where the central organizing purpose is fun.”

Look out, Tyra—this isn’t just some “America’s Next Top Model” fashion show­—this is Harvard formal season. Last Sunday afternoon, Styleta hosted its first Charity Dress Swap in honor of the upcoming formals season. The nonprofit takes donations of luxury clothing and accessories, sells them online, and gives the proceeds to charities. Founded by Yifan Zhang ’10 last spring, Styleta now has branches at Binghamton University, Indiana University, and NYU. “I wanted to revolutionize the traditional charity thrift store by focusing on designer clothing and making it available to more people at lower prices online,” said Zhang.
After collecting over 100 dresses during the past week, Styleta opened the doors to Lowell’s Junior Common Room so that Harvard students could borrow dresses from their peers. Browsing the racks filled with short, long, and sequined numbers, yells of “Are you getting it? Are you getting that purple dress? I want it!” and “Maybe it’s from Asia where the sizes are really small?” could be heard throughout the room.
For every piece a student loaned, she received $5 off from the original $10 borrowing fee. Zhang hoped to put some of the money collected from the dress swap towards funding women’s initiatives as well as the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and other local causes.
Charities benefited from the dress swap, but borrowers and lenders did as well. When asked if she had had any success, Anna E. Pritt ’11 said, “Yeah, I found a really cute dress. I didn’t know if I’d find anything but I definitely did.”
Looking for a dress to wear to the Adams formal, Amy M. Yin ’13 explained, “I lent five dresses. I feel like you get more out of a dress when you let other people wear it. I just think the event is really awesome—I mean, it goes to charity.”

We’ve seen it before. Scrawled on the wall of some grubby gas station restroom are the bubble letters in bright pink: “Stacy luvs gus 4eva.”
But consider these words: “Why does everyone go to Wall Street?” Or how about this: “I am loosing my fucking mind without my meds. It hurts to breathe. I can’t talk without crying. I wish I wasn’t born like this.”
At least five years ago—no one’s sure exactly when—the stalls of the women’s bathroom on the first floor of Adams House became informal confessionals. Upon the peeling white paint of the swinging doors, students—female, one could assume—scribbled their fears, phobias, and questions in different colors. Layers of writing collected on top of the paint: words overlapped, private exclamations collided with sober questions, and old inscriptions faded as fresh ones took their place. Some of the writing is admittedly frivolous—of the gas station variety—but most of the scribbles reveal deeply personal thoughts and concerns, the sort of intimate details reserved for the best of friends.
The stalls also display trickles of dialogue among commentators. To the individual who found it difficult to breathe, someone offered words of earnest encouragement: “Pray ’cause God loves you, and He knows how you feel. And the way you are—it’s the world crushing you. I’ve been where you are and it gets better, I promise.”
Some of the interchanges showcase the advice of those with appropriate experience. One student wrote: “I throw up once or twice a week. Is that bulimic?” Her response? “Talk to someone. I’ve been bulimic for seven years.”
And yet other conversations are best described as forums; as one individual asks, “What do you do when you realize you’re in a relationship that’s not quite right but you don’t think you’ll ever find someone better?” Apparently, enough people felt strongly enough about the question to leave several different answers: “Leave.” “Never settle.” “He’s not worth it. Snap out of it and move on. You are too awesome.”
Of course, this last response is somewhat disingenuous; the commentator has no way of identifying the original questioner, whose inquiry was left unsigned. But the nature of the response—supportive, empowering, uplifting—reflects the general ethos of the stalls. Forget the faces behind the questions and the personalities that extend far beyond the writing. At the very moment that a student leaves her anonymous mark on the wall of that bathroom stall, she knows that she is in a safe space, an open space without faces or names.
A few weeks ago, the Adams House custodial staff painted over the writing. According to Adams House Master Judith Palfrey, the aesthetic of the bathroom stalls was unpleasant, and Palfrey asked that the doors be painted over. But though the layers of writing and the collage of confessions are no longer visible, they are still there, locked away beneath that smooth, egg-shell surface.
CONSTRUCTING IMAGE
How can we explain all of this covert activity on the stalls of the Adams bathroom? And is there a reason why this is happening here, at Harvard?
Shoshana S.R. Tell ’10 and Kacie M. Rounds ’11 are co-directors of Room 13, a confidential peer counseling service located in the basement of Thayer. From the velveteen purple couches of their office, Tell and Rounds, like all Room 13 counselors, listen as students reveal their most guarded vulnerabilities. Some students shed tears,  while others sort through issues that they would not share with anyone else—proctors, parents, roommates and friends included.
In their experience as counselors, Tell and Rounds say that there is certainly an image that Harvard students seek to maintain.
According to Tell, students want to be seen as organized, on top of their stuff. “It’s not true for everyone, but at a high-achieving school there is a sense of the importance of looking put together,” she says.
Of course, Tell’s is not a strictly literal observation. Many students wander around in sweatpants, and the scramble to finish a problem set or print a paper just before the deadline are part of the normal grind. For Tell, “looking put together” is more a matter of obscuring any personal issues like those on the Adams bathroom wall.
“Harvard is such an environment of driven, ambitious people who are goal-oriented, who have a similar goal of success—either at school or in life,” Rounds says. As a result, she says, students are often reluctant to show when they are not successful at a particular extracurricular or academic endeavour, however that success may be defined.
“It is much harder to be able to be willing to let that be shown in a place where they think that everyone is trying to succeed,” Rounds adds, commenting as a student and not from her position as a Room 13 officer.
According to academic psychologists and counselors, as well as the accounts of students themselves, personal and private outpourings in public spaces stem from a very human need for self-expression. Yet the competing need to erase any identifying traces leads, as in the case of Adams’ bathroom stalls, to a phenomenon of anonymous authorship.
According to Kennedy School Professor J. Richard Hackman, a specialist in social and organizational psychology, the phenomenon of anonymous authorship recalls an argument made by sociologist Erving Goffman in his text “The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.”
When interacting with others, Goffman argues, an individual “will have many motives for trying to control the impression [others] receive.” As a result, Goffman writes, most individuals will calculate their manners, and in an effort to impart a specific type of impression, will “accentuate certain matters and conceal others.”
What students choose to accentuate or conceal is, to be sure, different for each individual, but there are things that most are generally less willing to broadcast to the masses: eating disorders, stress, family problems, relationship problems—anything, in essence, that can be perceived as a weakness. Anything that others, to borrow a colloquial phrase, might deem “too real.”
From her desk at the Office of Career Services, Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities, sees students lay a piece of paper on the table, revealing the accumulation of everything from internship experiences, GPAs, high school awards, and tuba-playing accolades. Students come to her vulnerable, looking to being building a career.
Mount has found that many Harvard students, though eager to seek her advice, are unwilling to ask for similar advice from their peers; on this campus, résumés—not unlike problems at home or relationship difficulties—fall into the category of personal information that shouldn’t be shared.
Take Mount’s example of a varsity athlete. “You might be on a team and you know tons of stuff about that person, but you have no idea what jobs they are applying for because no one talks about that,” Mount says. According to her, no one talks about it because of an underlying sense of competition, because showing peers a résumé creates a vulnerability. With a résumé exposed, all the cards are laid bare.
Mount says that she and the OCS are working to let “students know that they are a part now of a big Harvard community and network and that everyone’s success is their success.” But for now, résumé-sharing outside of the walls of OCS remains rare.
ESCAPING VISIBILITY
Harvard students eat in dining halls designed to accommodate hundreds of people, work out in gyms where entire schools of the University have swipe access, sit in lectures that entertain over 600 people, and sleep on hallways with dozens of other rooms. With the addition of roommates, even the bedroom becomes a quasi-public space.
“Our school is pretty small and tight-knit,” reflects Tej A. Toor ’10, the creator of isawyouharvard.com. “There is a sense that you know people.”
On such a communal campus, Harvard students face a burden of high visibility, and Adams dining hall, an intimate space regularly flooded by diners from all over campus, epitomizes the state of inescapable visibility. It may be more than coincidence that the aforementioned bathroom walls are right around the corner.
Though the comfort of anonymity may not be specific to Harvard’s campus, worries about public image are heightened at Harvard, some say, because of the intensity of the environment. As Hackman wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson, researchers have not yet addressed the question of “whether people who are in communities where people know and regularly encounter one another are more or less likely to post anonymously,” but anecdotal evidence implies that in close communities, people may be more inclined to keep things covered up only to later reveal them anonymously rather than present personal matters to the community as a whole.
Toor, who runs two other “isawyou” websites at Rutgers University and the University of Maryland, says that although each campus site has unique characteristics, Harvard’s site stands out for its distinctly emotional charge: “The Harvard one is the most characterized by pent up feelings and deep-seated thoughts and that sort of thing,” says Toor, who attributes the deep-seated emotional expression to the possibility that Harvard students are less willing to make themselves vulnerable to their peers.
Similar to Craigslist’s “Missed Connections,” Toor’s websites invite students to post amorous notes about their crushes—names striken but humorous descriptions preserved—in the hopes that the crush might see the post. If professing in person, the speaker would be deemed quite bold. Yet on the Internet, the speaker is masked, so the potentially negative ramifications of proclaiming one’s feelings effectively disappear.
“You can say whatever you want to on the Internet,” Toor explains. “There is no name attached. You don’t need to put in your e-mail address anywhere. Even I as the administrator have no idea who is posting what.”
“I think doing something anonymously is emboldening,” says Ewa Sadej ’12, who posts on isawyouharvard.com. “You can put out your thoughts without having to face the consequences, and you can gauge the reaction from people without them knowing who you are and potentially embarrassing yourself.”
Anonymous expression is an escape from the visibility that Harvard students everywhere encounter. There is a certain freedom to anonymity: what  a student does or says is not ascribed to that individual. The student’s responsibility is deflected.

But the stories on HarvardFML.com, though funny and light, are also the stories that you save for your closest friends. Posting on the sites anonymously “removes accountability,” says Jonah L. Varon ’13, who created and oversees PrincetonFML.com and over 20 other college FML sites. “It can mean that you can post offensive things, and if they are not moderated they will never get traced back to you. But it also means that you don’t have to worry about maintaining a reputation, you don’t have to worry about embarrassing yourself.”
INVISIBLE, BUT HEARD
But not all the posts on HarvardFML.com are humorous. Some lament lousy grades, others describe crying into a pillow on Saturday night because of unrequited love. The reasons for keeping those posts private tap into a different sort of embarrassment—one that would be much deeper were the posters’ identities revealed.
Toor also credits this potential embarrassment with part of the success of her site. Her original intention was to create a gag site for a computer science project, but over the first few weeks of its launch, she watched as more and more users began to see it as a space for serious self-expression.
“I think a lot of them—especially the male posts—are kind of sappy,” Toor says. “Maybe there is some sort of stigma attached to that sort of thing.”
Of course, people tend to be hush-hush about crushes anyway. “You might not want your crush knowing that [you think] she is the most beautiful girl in the world,” Toor adds. “I think it is the nature of the subject material—people often keep things of that sort private, so this gives them a space to make it public.”
Unlike HarvardFML.com, where a post is an end unto itself, Toor’s site can be a host for real world connections, and the potential for actual follow-up can give the posts a more serious undertone. Initially, Toor’s site lacked a mechanism for posting back or for commenting in response to posts, but she created one when she saw the utility of such a function.
Sadej first posted after the Harvard-Yale game when she found herself attracted to a fellow Dunsterite but unable to make the first move. “I wanted to try my luck and entertain my friends,” she said. “I’m kind of shy with guys. I don’t like to initiate because I feel whenever I initiate I’ve gotten hurt in the past. So I just try to put myself out there but not directly say, ‘Hey, what are you doing tonight?’”
Indeed, for those who post, the boldness one assumes—the liberty of self-expression, especially when anonymous—may be the appeal of posting.
“I don’t think that my site is enabling people to have different online personas—that’s creepy—but I guess it allows them to explore a different identity of themselves or express a different part of themselves that they don’t feel comfortable expressing when their feelings and thoughts are linked to themselves,” Toor speculates.
In real life, Sadej was genuinely interested in the boy addressed in her posted. But in real life, she did not want to approach him. So online, in the safe venue that Toor created, she expressed her feelings. Though Sadej never received a response—she doubts whether she even ever caught her mystery man’s attention—she maintains that she is glad she wrote the post.
Though Sadej’s satisfaction in the face of a failed connection may seem odd, PrincetonFML.com’s Varon explained why expressing oneself, even anonymously, can be satisfying.
“There is some satisfaction seeing something that you have written published in a public place even if it doesn’t get attributed to you,” Varon says.
Having people read what you write, Varon asserts, is a form of power—it is, in many ways, both liberating and cathartic. For those like Sedaj, a post is a risk with no cost and the potential for gain, and taking that risk was freeing in itself.
ANONYMOUS RESOURCES
But the Adams’ bathroom walls and sites like HarvardFML.com are far from being the only spaces for anonymous expression on campus, though they may be the most spontaneous and organic. The University has a wealth of resources for those seeking anonymous and highly confidential outlets, ranging from University Mental Health Services to peer organizations such as Room 13.
HUHS’ Chief of Mental Health Services Dr. Richard D. Kadison lists relationship and adjustment concerns, academic stresses, attention problems, depression or anxiety, sometimes triggered by external academic, family, or personal issues, as well as cultural challenges and health worries about friends and family as the most common subjects HUHS patients seek to address in counseling, though they are often the same subjects students try to keep hidden from their peers.
Part of Room 13’s mission is to make each student aware that their peers are confronting similar insecurities. “That we are there as a resource that is available [is] a positive sign...that you’re not the only one who is struggling,” Rounds says. “I feel like a lot of people have this impression that everyone here has it all figured out perfectly, is on top of everything. [But] we’re not just perfect robots.”
Similarly, a Bureau of Study Counsel brochure, one of dozens of colored-paper handouts on a table by the entrance to the Linden Street office, advertises a weekly group session to deal with perfectionism, which the Bureau has tag-lined as “the double-edged sword.”
“Are your fears of falling short of your own or other’s expectations obstacles to your learning, completing your work, or living a healthy life?” the flyer asks. “Do you feel trapped on a treadmill of joyless performing and achievement?”
According to Kadison, roughly 15 percent of Harvard’s student body uses HUHS’ mental health resources, with female students forming a majority of those patients. But the portion of female students writing on the bathroom wall is a much slimmer and more informal contingent. Rather than look to a professional outlet, the students who write on the bathroom wall turn to an invisible, anonymous community.
And the angst expressed on the bathroom walls is anything but trivial; scrawled in all sorts of handwriting, the words reveal the raw and very real experiences students were not willing to share while seated on a futon in a common room or around a table in the dining hall.
As one student wrote on the wall before it was painted over, “These bathroom doors are the most honest thing at Harvard.”
In the past few weeks, the Adams’ bathroom wall has slowly come back to life.
“Why did you erase us? These walls meant something,” one student recently wrote.
And with a lonely arrow, drawn in careful cursive, a fellow student responded, “Hear, hear.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After this spring, hard alcohol will no longer be served at on-campus House formals, as the Cambridge License Commission will now only issue beer and wine licenses­­ for ticketed events taking place in dining halls.
This decision—which may not alter plans for this spring’s formals—will not affect formals being held off-campus. House events that do not serve hard alcohol or do not charge for admission, such as stein clubs, are also exempt from the change, said Assistant Dean of Harvard College for Student Life David R. Friedrich at yesterday’s meeting of the Committee on Student Life.
The Commission informed Friedrich of the change on Monday, only two days before the first spring formal occurred last night.
Due to the short notice, the Commission might issue all-alcohol licenses for this year’s spring formals if an officer of the University—such as a resident tutor or House Master—were the person of record on the license rather than a student, Friedrich said. Houses will have to make that decision on a case-by-case basis.
“It is unfortunate that we had less time to prepare for this change, but we will make the best of it and comply with the Cambridge Licensing Commission’s expectations,” Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson wrote in an e-mail.
While reviewing its procedures, the Commission discovered that its issuance of all-alcohol licenses for similar past events was not in compliance with Massachusetts law, Friedrich said.
The Commission’s decision elicited disappointment in the Houses, but House Committee members said they were confident this semester’s formals and future formals will continue to delight students.
“It’s really no one’s fault here at the University,” said David L. Billing ’11, a Mather HoCo co-chair. “There’s not much we can do about it. We’re going to go ahead with our formal planning even if there’s no hard liquor.”
Mather HoCo had purchased liquor earlier this week for the Venice Carnival before the decision was announced, but the vendor assured them that their purchase could be refunded if it is not served, Billing said.
Bryan W. Dunmire ’11, co-chair of the Eliot HoCo, said he feared that some Houses may resort to off-campus venues in order to keep serving hard alcohol. While this year Dunmire said House administrators told him liquor will still be at Fête, he said in the future Eliot may choose to stick to beer, wine, and champagne in order to continue hosting the event in the House.
“The Fête is just so traditionalized for however many years we’ve been doing this. It has this beautiful set-up that we’re used to having this swing band outside and a DJ inside, of having a chocolate fountain and food in our JCR,” Dunmire said. “The fact that it’s in Eliot is a celebration of Eliot itself.”
Elizabeth Y. Lint, executive officer of the Cambridge License Commission, was not available for comment.

University officials say they continue to consider the conditions of previous agreements they made with the City of Boston before the December halt of construction on the Allston Science Complex in brainstroming plans for Harvard’s development in the neighborhood.
University Executive Vice President Katharine N. Lapp, who oversees Harvard’s expansion into Allston, said she and the faculty-led work team continue to use the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s 2005 document “North Allston: Strategic Framework for Planning” as a “guidepost.”
She specifically mentioned the plan to turn Western Avenue into the “main street” of the neighborhood.
The Boston Redevelopment Authority maintains Harvard is still responsible for all the commitments it made to the city, even after the halt of construction on the Science Complex, the roughly $1 billion project that represented the first component of Harvard’s ambitious 50-year plan to construct an extension of its campus across the Charles River.
“Harvard continues to be responsible for the conditions and commitments contained within the cooperation agreement for the Science Complex development and any commitments that remain in force from existing campus plan approvals,” the Authority’s spokeswoman Jessica Shumaker wrote in an e-mailed statement. “Their current master plan is in effect until 2012. President Faust stated in December of last year that the campus plan for Allston will be updated by 2012,” she wrote.
But residents say that they have not seen a clear indication that Harvard is sticking to its promises.
Allston resident Harry Mattison, who serves on the Harvard Allston Task Force, cited unfulfilled commitments to create new housing units, bring jobs to the neighborhood, and  bring a subway stop to Barry’s Corner.
Mattison added that he understands that University’s finances have changed, but said Harvard should be more communicative with the neighborhood about its plans.
“It would certainly be wonderful if Harvard and  the community could get together to refresh and update and revise the list of community improvements it said it would bring to the neighborhood,” Mattison said.
Allston resident Bruce Houghton echoed these sentiments.
“The Task Force is no longer meeting since the cancellation of the science complex,” Houghton said. “Since then there’s [been] no real format for doing reasonable communication and I’m not sure its happening at all. We’re  looking all up from here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From South America to Sever Hall, Tracy T. Han ’11 has synthesized her interest in the sprawling field of global health into a comprehensive four-year plan of study.
“Global health as a field is incredibly interdisciplinary,” Han says. “One of the problems that people find is that global health is this hodgepodge of topics. I’m trying to stick it all together.”
In the past few years, global health has become an increasingly popular topic of study on a national scale. As evidenced by a growing number of global health-related courses and organizations, Harvard is no exception to this trend, though no academic concentration in the field is available.
From working on frog leg regeneration in Chile, to examining water project pilot protocols in the Dominican Republic, to studying rural Chinese medicine, Harvard undergraduates interested in global health issues are devising their own ways to delve into the field—even in the absence of an institutionalized department.
These students say they have used their creativity and initiative to gain theoretical and practical understandings of global health in order to make contributions to the field.
FINDING THEIR WAY
Inspired by her freshman seminar on child health in America, Han worked to design a special concentration in global health, supplementing it with courses in sociology.
Midway through her sophomore year—shortly after declaring her special concentration—Han left Harvard to further pursue this interest, spending four months of spring 2009 in Bangladesh, where she helped develop a pilot protocol for ridding water of arsenic and bacteria.
The experiences “got me to see public health working in another country,” Han says, adding that she was able to see “the application of what she had been learning” term-time.
Like Han, Michael T. Henderson ’11 also created his own special concentration. After taking Harvard Medical School Professor Paul Farmer’s class on global health the fall of his sophomore year, Henderson says that he “couldn’t get enough.”
By the following term, Henderson had decided not to concentrate in human and evolutionary biology. This semester, he created his own junior tutorial, which was taught by Patrick T. Lee, a clinical instructor in medicine at HMS.
Henderson emphasizes the human dimension of his global health coursework and research.
For whatever region of the world he focuses on, Henderson says that he aims to “really [see] the society and the people in the culture, and [take] that in.”
Henderson adds that he practiced this objective last year in a self-designed study. Traveling to Peru and China, he researched the perception of illness between traditional and Western medicine.
But according to Henderson, he hasn’t created a path only for himself. Instead, he says he has worked on developing inclusive opportunities for students interested in global health. To that end, last fall Henderson founded The Harvard College Global Health Review, an undergraduate student publication that “aims to raise the levels of both scholarship and awareness in relation to issues within the realm of global health,” according to its website.
And currently, Henderson is designing a January-Term trip to Honduras, which he says will be an “educational experience” for interested students.
RISING POPULARITY
Henderson calls global health “sexy.” Han says it’s the “hot topic.” And both students point to globalization’s contribution to global health’s fad appeal.
Jeffrey B. Low ’11, who serves as president of Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum, attributes the popularity to global health’s interdisciplinary nature.
“There’s truly something for everyone,” he says. “You don’t have to be a doctor, you don’t have to have a Ph.D. to make a difference.”
But others say that structural changes in Harvard’s curricula are, in part, the cause behind students’ increased interest in Global Health.
Rebekah Getman, the program manager for the Harvard Initiative for Global Health, points to the launch of the General Education program as fostering an “uptick in student interest” in the field.
Gen Ed has given Harvard a “platform to address global health in a way we haven’t been able to before by encouraging more broad-based classes and innovative teaching techniques that allow a faculty member...to bring what she does over at the Harvard School of Public Health [for example] to the undergrads,” Getman says.
But according to David Cutler, a professor in applied economics noted for his work on the economics of health, the global health scene at Harvard was starkly different just a few years ago.
“There was almost nothing a student interested in global health could do in terms of studying it formally at Harvard,” Cutler says. “We had very few courses. There were faculty interested but they weren’t brought together in any serious way.”
Recently, the field has also enjoyed the support of University officials.
“[University President] Drew Faust’s two biggest priorities are global health, and energy and the environment,” Cutler says.
Cutler adds that this priority has been manifested in the growing number of global health-related courses taught by faculty ranging from Law School to Medical School professors.
But these courses are becoming more than just a mix of elective classes.  Next year, the secondary field in health policy—which was first approved in 2007—will become a joint public health and global health secondary, according to Deborah L. Whitney, the executive director of the Harvard Interfaculty Initiative in Health Policy.
THE FUTURE
Research and extracurricular opportunities in global health have grown in tandem with course offerings. The Harvard Initiative for Global Health, the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition (HCGHAC), the Harvard Undergraduate Global Health Forum, and the Harvard Project for Sustainable Development are among the most visible newly established student organizations at the College.
Still, opinions vary on the possibility of global health becoming its own concentration.
Since the field is inherently interdisciplinary, Cutler says he does not think it would make sense as its own concentration. He adds that it is important for students to have a “firm foothold” in a discipline while cultivating a subject area of interest.
“The answer is not to flood us with more classes,” says Krishna M. Prabhu ’11, a member of HCGHAC.
Rather, Harvard’s efforts should go towards research on neglected diseases with the aim of benefitting the mostly impoverished people who suffer from such diseases, Prabhu adds.
But both Han and Henderson say there is value in having a concentration devoted to global health.
There is still a “real need to connect the experiences students have in the classroom with experiences students have on the ground,” Han says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Actor Alec Baldwin, a self-proclaimed liberal, advocated for campaign finance reform and sustainable energy initiatives as solutions to the nation’s political and economic problems during a talk at the Institute of Politics last night.
Looking just as suave as Jack Donaghy, his character on “30 Rock,” Baldwin appeared before a packed audience to participate in a Q&A session with Rick Berke, national editor of the New York Times. Throughout the evening, Berke and Baldwin maintained a playful banter while also conducting more serious political discussions on the Iraq war, Sarah Palin, and whether or not Baldwin would date a Republican—the answer is no.
Initially a political science major at George Washington University, Baldwin said he originally planned to go to law school after college.
“I very badly wanted to go into politics,” he said. “At GW I joined the College Democrats and did a lot of canvassing for them.”
On a dare from a friend, Baldwin applied to acting school at NYU and was offered a drama scholarship. “It was important to go to a school I could afford,” he said. “When I went to college, they didn’t have the levels of financial support that they do today.”
Although he has put his civic career on hold for the past several decades, Baldwin has remained involved with politics, attending the 1988 Democratic National Convention and working closely with Senator Edward M. Kennedy ‘54-’56 during Kennedy’s 1994 re-election campaign.
Baldwin—who is involved with Riverkeeper, a clean water advocacy group, and serves on the board of People for the American Way, a civil rights organization—said he uses his celebrity status to advocate for causes he believes in, especially clean politics and clean energy initiatives.
“Bill Clinton killed welfare reform as an act of conciliation to Republicans,” Baldwin said, noting his disappointment with public servants that cave to political pressures. “I believe in a government that will ultimately at least try to do the most amount of good for the greatest number of people it can.”
According to Baldwin, lax campaign finance regulations have led to many of the problems that plague the American political arena. “I don’t want to see anyone who’s unqualified in office,” he said. “It always troubles me that certain politicians are all too willing to serve the needs of powerful interest groups.”
Baldwin also emphasized the importance of renewable energy research, saying that he supports wind power initiatives such as placing giant turbines off the shore of Long Island, where he lives.  “Wind turbines would be the symbol of our energy independence,” he said. “We wouldn’t have to fight bogus wars for oil anymore.”
When Berke asked whether Baldwin would consider running for office in New York, Baldwin said, “Anything can happen in politics. You never know what the future holds.”
Near the end of the discussion, Baldwin was asked to offer advice to the audience both as himself and his alter ego Jack Donaghy. “You have to figure out who you are and what you want to do,” Baldwin said. “If you want to make money, make money. If you don’t care about money, go into publishing.”
Later, in the voice of Donaghy, he added, “From the time you get your first job until you’re about forty-five to fifty, go strong equity, when you’re fifty, switch to bonds, when you’re sixty-five, get out.”

Feminist-vegan Carol J. Adams, who authored “The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist Vegetarian Critical Theory,” urged students to reject animal products, pointing out the parallels between the consumption of meat and misogyny at an event sponsored by the Harvard College Vegetarian Society.
According to Adams, meat-eating is equated with masculinity and power in society. She referred to male-bonding in steak-houses or at barbecues as examples of a culture of male-dominant consumption of meat and women.
An ad showing “grills gone wild” and the restaurant chain Hooters demonstrate the “feminization of animals and the animalization of women,” she said.
Adams said she was motivated by her strong views on promoting equality “for all beings.”
“I want to do the least harm possible, I want to walk lightly on this earth,” she said.
Adams noted that meat-eating would not exist if female animals were not forced into pregnancy and their reproductive abilities exploited to produce milk and eggs.
“Oppression isn’t an idea. It’s an activity,” Adams said. “It is this activity.”
Adams also opposed the degradation of fish.
“We have treated fishes as a mass term ‘fish’ and we don’t view them as individuals,” she said.
Some audience members challenged Adams for not including statistics about the pervasiveness of the problem, and for declining to specify whether she would oppose meat-eating in an “ideal world” in which animals were not exploited. But Adams said she wanted to look at the existence of female and animal debasement as an “experience” rather than a number.
“I don’t give a damn about statistics,” Adams said. “I feel that using statistics participates in a rationalized way of thinking about the problem that undercuts my perspective.”
Demanding statistical proof of the prevalence of the association between women and meat consumption, Adams said, was “deflecting the issue.”
Jono M. L. Rosenthal ’13, who is vegetarian, said he appreciated her liberal viewpoint and her emphasis on the importance of tackling issues in the context of the real world, as opposed to an “ideal” world. Rosenthal also noted that many of the aggressive questioners were men.
Vegetarian Society Co-Founder Jessica M. Luna ’10 said she “was hoping the provocativeness of the topic would draw people to the event” whether or not they are vegetarian.
Luna said that while the majority of her club is female, she believes there may be men who do not participate in vegetarian activism.
Erika C. Jahn, a second-year student at the Harvard Divinity School who writes a vegan-feminist blog, said though she was surprised by the difficult questions, she thought that Adams handled the situation well.
“I have never seen someone cross-examined like this at Harvard,” Jahn said.

The Chabad House at Harvard, an Orthodox Jewish center, has placed a $6 million bid to purchase the building at 45 Dunster Street from the Fly Club—which currently leases the space to the Bee Club—according to exchanges on final club e-mail lists obtained by The Crimson.
The Bee had already served a notice of termination on their lease to the Fly, according to an individual familiar with the situation. But this week, Bee members have solicited support and donations from many final club members via e-mail.
But the $6 million bid—which the Bee learned about “a few days ago,” according to an e-mail—is more than double the assessed value of the building and land, which the City of Cambridge placed at $2.7 million, according to 2010 property records.
“This offer is above market value for the house and is very attractive for the Fly graduate board from a business perspective,” read an e-mail that was sent over a final club list. “The Bee was informed of the offer a few days ago and the girls have been working hard to try to raise enough money to counter the offer.”
Harvard’s Chabad House, which coordinates outreach to the University’s Jewish community, currently owns a building on Banks Street near Dunster and Mather Houses, which it purchased for $1.5 million in 2003.
The Fly retained ownership of the Dunster Street building when it merged with the now-defunct D.U. Club in 1996. High-end men’s apparel boutique J.Press is a current lessee of the space, with a storefront facing Mt. Auburn Street.
Several other final clubs also own property in Harvard Square that they rent to local businesses. Sandrine’s occupies a space owned by the Porcellian Club, the A.D. Club owns the building to be occupied by TD Bank, and the Spee Club rents part of its building to Schoenhof’s Foreign Books.
Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, a founder and director of the Chabad House at Harvard, did not return phone calls for comment. Bee Club President Mariana B. Zobel De Ayala ’11 and Fly Club President Jordan D. Feldman ’11 declined to comment on the record. Members of the clubs who were contacted for this article referred comment to the presidents.

Aside from last weekend’s upset win by the men’s lacrosse team over No. 6 Princeton, it has been the Harvard women who have been making headlines lately. Dominating the Ivy League in a pair of sports are three Crimson ladies, who have taken home some of the highest honors the Ancient Eight has to offer this week.
Freshman standouts Jennifer VanderMeulen and Katie Sylvan were unanimously voted as Ivy League Rookie of the Year in lacrosse and golf, respectively, and each garnered first-team All Ivy honors. Sylvan’s teammate, sophomore Christine Cho, earned second-team All Ivy honors but took home the title of Ivy League Player of the Year based on her performance throughout the season.
VanderMeulen currently tops the Ancient Eight and sits sixth in the nation in goals per game with 3.64. The attacker has scored 51 goals and tallied eight assists to earn her league honors and help carry Harvard to a 7-7 season.
Sylvan and Cho led their teams to four first-place finishes, a pair of dual-competition wins against Lynn and Central Florida, and a third-place finish at the Ivy League Championships last weekend.
Although the men’s side of athletics has had its fair share of success this year, one must, as Abigail Adams once put it, “remember the ladies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the major leagues, playing at .500 will leave you short of the playoffs. The Crimson may earn the same fate if it continues to split doubleheaders.
In a continuation of last weekend’s matchup with Yale (18-21-1, 5-11 Ivy League), the Harvard baseball team (15-23, 8-7) split another pair of contests yesterday, topping the Bulldogs, 14-12, before falling in the nightcap, 8-3, at Yale Field.
The Crimson’s offense started hot, cruising to a 13-0 lead in the first three innings of the earlier game and holding on for the win. But it was Yale that sustained its level of play, riding strong hitting at the end of the first contest to a solid opening in game two. With a seven-run lead of its own four innings into the nightcap, the last-place Bulldogs assured themselves an even day.
“We didn’t come out. We didn’t have the same fire,” junior captain Tyler Albright said of the second game. “We weren’t able to stop them.”
YALE 8, HARVARD 3
Although the Crimson looked to have the momentum after taking the first contest, the Bulldogs did not seem discouraged after outscoring the visitors, 9-1, in the last four innings of game one.
“[Yale’s] bats rolled right through. They kept on going the next game,” Albright said. “It took us awhile to get into it.”
By the time the Harvard plated its first run, the Bulldogs had already amassed a 7-0 lead against rookie Andrew Ferreira and sophomore Will Keuper. In a stark contrast from game one, walks plagued the Crimson early, as Ferreira issued four free passes in 2.2 innings of work. Twice, Yale baserunners orchestrated a double steal after walks, setting up easy scoring opportunities.
Harvard’s fortunes appeared to turn in the top of the fifth, when sophomore Marcus Way belted the first pitch he saw over the right-field fence to put the Crimson on the board. Following a scoreless inning from Keuper, Harvard plated two more runs on back-to-back one-out singles with runners in scoring position from juniors Sam Franklin and Sean O’Hara, closing the gap to 8-3. Albright followed with a double play, though, and the Crimson would not score again due to effective pitching from Bulldog hurler Christopher O’Hare.
“We weren’t able to hit their starter very well,” Albright said. “He was throwing strikes, and we couldn’t put it in play well.”
O’Hare lasted 6.1 innings, yielding just three earned runs on no walks and a pair of strikeouts. Yale’s Chris Finneran worked 2.2 innings of scoreless relief to seal the victory for the Bulldogs.
HARVARD 14, YALE 12
The Crimson bats started the day scorching, as Harvard pounded out five first-inning hits that chased Bulldog sophomore Pat Ludwig after just two-thirds of an inning. Ludwig was tagged for five earned runs and yielded three walks as well before getting the hook.
But a pitching change did nothing to slow down the Crimson offense, as the visitors put up eight more runs over the next two innings. Most of the damage came from O’Hara in the cleanup spot, who belted doubles in the first and second innings and a bases-clearing triple in the third for a total of six RBI.
“[O’Hara] hit really well in the first game—he was hot,” Albright said. “It seemed like every time he came to the plate he had a big hit.”
“He was unbelievable,” sophomore Brent Suter added. “He’s one of those hitters who, when he’s hot, you do not want to pitch to him.”
Plenty of other Harvard batters got in on the action too, with senior Dan Zailskas lining a two-run single to left field in the top of the first and Albright notching a pair of RBI singles in the second and third. All told, the Crimson had staked junior starter Max Perlman to a 13-0 lead before he even broke a sweat.
And Perlman—who continued to show recovery from elbow surgery with his longest outing of the season (63 pitches)—took full advantage. After yielding a leadoff single in the bottom of the first, the Harvard hurler promptly picked off Yale leadoff man Cam Squires and retired the next four batters he faced. Perhaps the best sign for Perlman was the junior’s ability to throw strikes consistently. Of his 63 pitches, 48 crossed the plate.
“He looks good and feels confident,” said Albright, who caught the entire doubleheader. “The first few innings he was dominant, throwing strikes on the first pitch.”
Unfortunately for Perlman, the Bulldogs began to hit those strikes in the third. Following a pair of singles, Squires bounced back from his baserunning blunder with a two-run triple and scored on a single by junior Andy Megee. Yale then posted another four runs in the fourth inning, closing the gap to six. When slugger Trygg Larsson-Danforth followed a Megee single with a two-run bomb to open the fifth, Walsh called for junior Eric Eadington to preserve the Crimson’s suddenly precarious four-run lead. But Eadington yielded four consecutive singles, finally stopping the onslaught with a double-play ball and a strikeout after the Bulldogs had pulled within 13-11.
The teams traded runs in the sixth inning, with Way scoring on a single from senior Chris Rouches and Larsson-Danforth launching a solo shot for his second home run of the game. With the game on the line, Walsh turned to sophomore Brent Suter, who bent but did not break in the bottom of the seventh. Despite yielding a pair of one-out singles, Suter induced a ground ball and forced Gant Elmore to fly out to right field, preserving the win for Harvard.
“It was the first time for me coming out of the [bullpen], so I was a little nervous out there,” Suter said. “But I was able to settle down, throw strikes, and let the defense work behind me, which they did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whoever coined the term “sophomore slump” hadn’t seen Jeff Cohen play in his second season for the Harvard lacrosse team.
The sophomore has scored 25 goals on the year, currently tied for first on the team with junior attackman Dean Gibbons. He also holds an impressive streak: scoring at least one point in each game of his career. The streak, which has reached 24 games, is the 14th longest of its kind in the nation, and, as if that wasn’t impressive enough, Cohen has scored a total 59 points and 14 assists over the stretch, more than any other Crimson player.
“I’m proud of the success I’ve had,” Cohen said. “It’s just a testament to the consistency I have and to the team.”
Although the number of goals Cohen has scored thus far falls short of the 34 he tallied his freshman year, this one statistic does not describe how Cohen has improved his own game and helped his teammates play better. Already, the sophomore has eight assists on the season, two more than last year, and he has strived to become a more complete player.
“I’ve tried to focus on a lot of little things this season,” Cohen reflected, when asked how he has developed as a player his sophomore year. “I haven’t just been focusing on scoring, but also on riding better, picking up more grounds balls, and leadership on the team.”
Seeing the last name Cohen on the Harvard lacrosse roster has become all too familiar this decade. Cohen’s two older brothers, Steven and Greg, played for the Crimson and graduated in 2006 and 2007. Jeff has looked to his brothers for inspiration throughout the years, especially when he was just getting his start.
“Both of his older brothers played, so he was always following in their footsteps,” his dad, Phil Cohen, said. “He started at a very young age when he was five years old. He was always the ball boy or water boy for the teams they were on. He would always try to get in there and play ball with them and be on their level, but obviously he couldn’t at such a young age.”
The Cohen clan has created a near dynasty on the field, producing three leading scorers in less than a decade. It wasn’t a surprise then that Jeff came to Harvard just two years after the younger of his two older brothers graduated.
“I was looking at a lot of the Ivies,” Cohen said. “Harvard stood out for me because my two older brothers went there, and it is respected for its academics.”
The Syosset, N.Y., native got his chance to shine for the Crimson in the first game of his freshman season when Cohen helped lift the lacrosse squad to a 9-6 victory against Duke on the Blue Devils’ own turf. Netting the first goal of his career, Cohen began his points streak which continues today.
“It was a great feeling,” Cohen remembered. “I had been looking forward to playing for Harvard since my oldest brother, Steven, came in 2002.”
Cohen has been following in his brothers’ footsteps, but he’s also blazing his own trail on the field. He’s become more of an all-around player, helping his teammates around him improve.
“He’s become a much better athlete as he’s become older, but he’s also matured as a player and teammate,” Phil Cohen said. “In high school, he was the top dog on the team, but it’s just great to see how he’s matured as a player and become part of the team, not just an individual.”
With this new attitude, Cohen and the Crimson’s other leading scorers have been working together and increased their total number of goals scored. Gibbons is tied with Cohen for the team-lead this season with 25 goals, followed by sophomore attackman Kevin Vaughan with 15 and sophomore midfielder Terry White with 13—all of which are improvements over last season.
But that’s not to suggest that Cohen doesn’t benefit from his teammates as well. Their success has inspired him to keep pushing himself and become a better player.
“I’m just motivated by my teammates to be the best I can be,” Cohen said.
When not on the field, the government concentrator is probably cracking the books open for his next exam. Cohen knows he can’t play lacrosse forever, so he has to start planning for the future.
“I’m not sure yet what I want to do after college, but I think I either want to go to grad school or law school,” Cohen said.
But for now, he’s just focusing on lacrosse. As his sophomore season wraps up, he can look back on the accomplishments he’s made as a more complete player for the team and how his teammates have helped him improve.
“His individual accomplishments are terrific,” Phil Cohen said, “but with that also comes the success of the team. Without the great core of players around him, he wouldn’t have been able to do it.”
If this is Cohen’s sophomore slump, there are no limits to how much he can improve in his junior year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Here’s an interesting hypothetical situation: after spending your high school years cultivating a bitter dislike for your biggest rival, you’re suddenly forced to spend multiple hours a day with him in a narrow, compact space. It could have the potential to be a little awkward, right?
As it turns out, this situation is anything but hypothetical—this was the reality sophomores Patrick Lapage and Nicholas Jordan faced when they joined the Harvard men’s heavyweight crew teams after competing against each other throughout high school.
Lapage, now stroking for the Crimson varsity eight, rowed for Britain’s Shrewsbury School while Jordan, currently sitting six seat of the same crew, rowed for Eton College a few hours south.
“[Competition] was pretty much as intense as you can get for my two years on varsity,” Jordan explained. “For those two years, there weren’t really other crews of a similar speed...They [Shrewsbury] were constantly our focus of training.”
When asked about Eton’s crew program, Lapage had a similar response.
“It was a pretty serious rivalry,” he said. “From my point of view, Eton was the main competition. I certainly think that in our junior and senior years, [Eton and Shrewsbury] were the two fastest crews in the country.”
Indeed, the Eton and Shrewsbury crews proved quite elite in their skill, and in their junior and senior years, Lapage and Jordan faced each other as their crews competed in the national championships.
“My junior year, we beat Shrewsbury and won the national championship,” Jordan said. “But my senior year, they beat us. Both of these races were within half of a length—maybe a second or two.”
But the competition between the two wasn’t limited to the national stage.
In their junior year, both Jordan and Lapage participated in the U-19 World Championships in Beijing. Lapage rowed for Britain while Jordan suited up for his native U.S.A.
Lapage first became aware of his rival’s presence in Beijing after seeing Jordan’s crew practice before the big race.
“I saw the American eight training, and I saw Nick Jordan in the opposite seat. It was pretty funny,” he recalled with a laugh. “I rowed with a couple guys from Eton doing the junior national team, so I knew who [Jordan] was although I never met him. They all spoke highly of him. It was hard to ignore the threat of such a big guy.”
Likewise, Jordan knew of Lapage’s strength on the water.
“I knew about him, and I knew him through mutual friends who did junior nationals,” Jordan said. “[Lapage] was always the competition.”
The scene entering the day of the race posed an unexpected—yet appropriate—way for the competitors to face off: the American and British crews were assigned adjacent lanes. With Jordan and Lapage pitted against each other so closely once more, the lane assignments seemed too fitting to be real.
The American eight ultimately beat the British crew, finishing second to China with a time of 05:59.47. Lapage and his eight crossed the 2000m mark to capture fifth place with a time of 06:01.30, less than two seconds after the U.S.A.
The rivalry between the pair took an interesting turn, though, when both Lapage and Jordan accepted spots in Harvard’s class of 2012 and on the heavyweight crew.
Jordan admitted that at first, there was definitely a strange dynamic between the two.
“It was a little bit weird,” he said. “I remember one time he had three Shrewsbury vests which he lent to a couple of guys our freshman year. One time I went out and saw that three or four guys were wearing Shrewsbury vests. That raised a few red flags in my mind subconsciously, since it gets burned in your mind after so many races,” Jordan explained.
Lapage also needed time to adjust to the concept of a former competitor as a teammate.
“It was weird...flipping straight over from racing against and almost developing a hatred—not based on character but because of Eton—to rowing with him and having him on my side,” Lapage noted.
Nevertheless, Lapage and Jordan rowed a very successful season. Their freshman eight turned out a 7-0 record in dual racing, and the crew captured silver at the Eastern Sprints and IRA National Championships.
This year, the two have not slowed their pace, and most recently they helped the No. 4 heavyweights win the Adams Cup versus No. 16 Navy and No. 18 Princeton. Their old high school rivalry has given way to an easy rapport.
“[Rowing in the 1V] is a reflection of both the talent and the hard work they’ve put in and the fact that they came to us with good experience,” Crimson coach Harry Parker said. “They row well together, and they get along well together.”

The following letter appeared in the April 29 issue of The Harvard Crimson:
Dear Harvard Community,
On behalf of our basketball program, I want to sincerely thank you for the tremendous support that was shown to our team this year.  To the students, faculty, staff and all members of the Harvard Community, thank you!
It was an unprecedented and record-breaking year for our basketball program, due to the hard work of our players, but also due to the incredible atmosphere and energy that you created in Lavietes Pavilion.  We had sellouts!  We had White Outs and Black Outs!  It was a very special thing to see, and we are truly grateful.  I hope you had as much fun as we did.
We are excited about next year and look forward to continuing the tradition of making Lavietes Pavilion as tough a place to play as there is in the Ivy League!
Many thanks, and Go Crimson!
Coach Tommy Amaker

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team was well represented when the Ivy League released its season awards Tuesday afternoon.
Three Crimson players were honored with All-Ivy selections, and freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen was unanimously selected as Ivy League Rookie of the Year.
VanderMeulen also earned a spot on the first-team All-Ivy squad after finishing the regular season as the conference’s leading scorer.
Sophomore midfielder Melanie Baskind concluded a strong rookie season by receiving a spot on the second team, while freshman Micaela Cyr received an honorable mention nod.
Baskind finished second in the Ancient Eight in ground balls per game and third in caused turnovers, while Cyr led Harvard in draw controls.
Last season, only two Crimson players earned All-Ivy selections, with then-sophomore Jess Halpern and then-freshman Tyler Petropulos earning first team and honorable mention, respectively.
Halpern, who missed the 2010 season due to injury, was the last Harvard player to win the conference’s award for the top newcomer back in 2008. Next season, the Crimson will have the luxury of both Halpern and VanderMeulen playing on the field at the same time.

Dancing in the dark is no novelty, but have you danced in silence?
This Friday night, The Laboratory at Harvard will transform the Northwest Science Building into one big dance floor for its first ever Silent LED Rave.
This isn’t your typical dining hall dance party—it’s an art and social experiment. The objective? To visualize music.
In collaboration with the American Repertory Theater, The Lab hopes to explore the intersections between art, science, and music through light photography and film.
Here’s how it works: download the four playlists from The Lab’s website, show up from 9 p.m. – 11 p.m. with your iPod, and hit the floor. Called Top 40 A, Dance A, Top 40 B, and Dance B , each playlist will be represented by a unique LED color with which to render light drawings.
“It’s about coordinating people into a theatrical spectacle,” said A.R.T. Artistic Fellow Allegra Libonati, one of the creators of the event.
Join the spectacle—The Lab promises to show you what your music looks like.

Oh, Reading Period. Brain waves ebb and flow, intellectual juices churn, and students abandon happiness and societal notions of hygiene to write essays and study for exams. Where better to have this scholarly experience than Lamont Library, where during Reading Period, students tend to camp out for days at a time.
The next couple of weeks will not be Lamont’s finest. The study areas will be crowded and hot, the students will be exhausted, and the atmosphere will be one of constant high-stress and intensity. However, if we all do our part, we can make Lamont as welcoming as possible.
Here’s a quick and dirty guide to the rules of conduct that will help you maneuver your experience in Harvard’s 24-hour library during this hectic time.
Be cognizant of how you smell
When people don’t wear socks and then take off their shoes in the reading room, their feet smell. However, as Professor Daniel Gilbert explained in his intro psych class this semester, the senses detect change; a person with smelly feet may not be aware of how much their feet smell simply because they are used to the odor. So for everybody’s sake, if you’re going to Lamont for the long haul, please wear socks. And while you’re at it, stock up on deodorant, toothpaste, and plenty of changes of clothing.
Eat real food, but not in the Reading Room
It’s probably unhealthy to subsist entirely on the mildly frozen California rolls available in Lamont Café for the duration of exams, so do your body a favor and grab some real grub. There are plenty of dining halls close by, and you can always spare a few minutes, give your brain a break, and eat some real dinner.
Be pleasant to others
Let’s think long-term, folks. There’s no need to cut someone in line at the Café, snub somebody of a seat, or be generally rude to your peers. Everybody is going through a rough patch, and you don’t want Reading Period to destroy your reputation for semesters to come. Buck up! It’ll be over soon.

According to sources in the blogosphere, a high school senior was accepted by Harvard to join the Class of 2014 but then had his offer rescinded when he supposedly invited Harvard to "kiss [his] ass" in a Facebook status update. We at FlyBy set out to debunk the myth.
According to a screenshot posted online, a high school student named Jacob wrote, "I just got my admittance letters into Yale, Duke, Northwestern, Penn, and Columbia. Now Harvard is begging my ass to go to their school. FULLY PAID SCHOLARSHIP. LOL." He added, "Hmmmm.... Ahahahaha naw kiss my ass. Fuck Harvard! I don't need no harvard or no scholarship HAHA! No really though, I'm going to harvard guys. Wooooooo! =D"
In response, a friend allegedly posted, "Don't say that about harvard lol. I heard some colleges check facebook profiles and they could reject you for saying that... It's been on the news. Some kid got admitted to Duke, but after he posted some pics of being drunk he got rejected. Be Careful." to which Jacob replied, "Hahaha don't worry bro."
Despite the fact that the posts are dated March 14 (well before regular admissions decisions were released at all of these schools), many blogs have characterized this as merely "possibly" a hoax. To completely disprove this cock-and-bull story, we here at FlyBy contacted Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons '67.
"The rumor about Facebook is not true." he wrote in an emailed statement.  Fitzsimmons, however, noted that the Office of Admissions "may view any publicly available information about individual applicants."

Never been to Lamont? (There’s a café there?) Not really sure where the Greenhouse is located? Still have $130 left on your BoardPlus before it expires on May 22? No worries, we’ve got your back (even though you just might live in a hole) on just how to spend your newfound wad of cash in this burning BoardPlus series.
BoardPlus Redemption Center: Cronkhite Dining Room, Cronkhite Graduate Center, Radcliffe Institute
Hours: Breakfast: Monday-Friday, 7:30 a.m.-10:00 a.m.; Lunch: Monday-Friday, 12:00 p.m.-2:00 p.m.; Dinner: Monday-Friday 5:00 p.m.-7:15 p.m.
Ambiance: Located in the same building as the Undergraduate Admissions Office, Cronkhite Dining Room looks onto a pristinely manicured, enclosed garden and courtyard. With a couple tables and chairs on the patio, Cronkhite could be a great place to catch a bit and study on a nice day. And even from inside, the views are beautiful and add a real charm to the space.
Inside, Cronkhite’s seating options look similar to those found in typical Harvard dining halls with tables arranged in rows and with a few smaller, private rooms to eat and chat. If it seems to resemble your House dining hall, that’s because Cronkhite is indeed also a graduate student dining hall. However, Cronkhite is much smaller and intimate than its dining hall counterparts in the Houses.
If you’re looking to work and plug-in, we at FlyBy could find only a few power ports along the wall, so arrive early during meal hours if you need to juice-up your laptop.
Food: It’s a pretty standard Harvard dining hall with buffet lines and trays. The entrées, soups, deserts, and drink selections were all just like those found in any undergraduate dining hall.  The salad bar has a few more premade salad options, but is largely also similar to what undergraduates expect in Annenberg or their House. However, unlike for undergraduates, Cronkhite offers containers for diners to fill and eat on-the-go.
The Final Word: It’s certainly hard to justify burning BoardPlus on food that could very well have come from your meal plan. But that logic is what got you in this mess of having so much BoardPlus leftover, so you might as well explore something new while you can.
