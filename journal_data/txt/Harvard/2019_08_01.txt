After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In today’s pop culture, liberalism is in and conservatism is out. Celebrities are more outspoken than before, but not always because of purely altruistic intentions — and Taylor Swift is a prime example of using her political activism for popularity.
In her most recent single, “You Need to Calm Down,” Swift places herself at the center of a narrative in which she does not belong — that of a civil rights movement which ought to center on gay rights. This egomania is common in the political activism of corporations and celebrities: PR departments across the United States paint their companies rainbow for Pride Month without making tangible contributions to actual advocacy. It is a type of political activism centered on profitization and branding. According to a feature in The Guardian, celebrities often put on the show of activism in order to “hel[p] polish their personal brands” by increasing their own range of power and influence — without actually pushing for tangible change for these communities.
The music video for “You Need to Calm Down” is guilty of this shortcoming. To begin: a garish filter washes over famous BGLTQ icons like Laverne Cox, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, and Todrick Hall (just to name a few). One feels as though, visually, they are pawns in Swift’s activist agenda.
Moreover, Swift unfairly paints rural communities as the quintessential antagonists of the BGLTQ community. They are depicted in a cartoonish, stereotypical manner with picket signs and crooked teeth while Taylor Swift and her entourage ignore them by tanning on chaise longues — a very apparent disparity in style. There are two major issues with this visual representation: First, Taylor Swift acts as though there are no BGLTQ people in rural communities, and second, the nonchalant attitude towards these protesters does not communicate the serious effect that these movements of bigotry and hatred have. It is not as simple as tanning it off.
Taylor Swift appears as the center of attention through it all, leaving the viewer to question this placement: Why craft a narrative about the BGLTQ community facing bigotry and hatred — and then put herself, a straight white woman, at the center?
An appropriate alternative would have been Taylor Swift removing herself from this narrative and illustrating the role of an ally — one not in the spotlight, but rather in support of those marginalized. She could have written this song, but not placed herself as the star of the music video. But as a result, this music video and song give the feeling of just another corporation trying to profit off Pride Month.
Taylor Swift’s activism continues to shine bright only when it is convenient for her interests. Most recently, her performance at Prime Day intentionally overlooks the Amazon workers strike against the exploitive conditions of their workplace. This performance, and many other superficial political statements, questions the scope of her political activism, which leans more on the side of financial gain, leaving her allyship in question.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m a fan of Marvel movies. As a critical moviegoer, I sometimes feel a little guilty for saying that; there is, after all, a certain formula that basically all movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) follow. All Disney has to do is cobble together a few CGI’ed fight scenes with some pop culture references and witty one-liners, and bam — that’s a billion dollars in the bank.
It’s hard, however, not to enjoy them. Not to feel a rush of adrenaline when T’Challa fights Kilmonger or when Thanos fights Iron Man or when Hulk beats the shit out of Loki. Not to be entranced by the beauty of the Quantum Realm or the trippiness of the Mirror Dimension or the grandeur of Wakanda. Not to laugh at literally every word that comes out of Paul Rudd’s mouth. If there is a person who doesn’t feel even the slightest urge to stand up and cheer when Captain America picks up Mjolnir (Thor’s Hammer), I have yet to meet them.
Aside from the fact that the MCU is the world’s biggest cash cow for the world’s biggest entertainment company, there’s another thing that makes me a little uncomfortable when I shell out 10 bucks for a movie ticket. It’s the fact that of the 32 “main characters” in “Avengers: Endgame,“ only seven are black, and only one is Asian. The rest — putting aside the less conventional demographics, including but not limited to green, raccoon, robot, and tree — were white. It’s the fact that of the sixteen solo MCU movies, only one has been a person of color, and only one has been a woman. It’s the fact that 11 years, 23 movies, and $22.4 billion dollars (!) later, not a single BGLTQ, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, or disabled superhero has graced the entire multiverse.
For a movie studio grounded in a country that is projected to become majority minority in the next few decades, this has been a failure — not of imagination, but of effort. Marvel has the money and the ethos to get literally whoever they want. Yet, an ensemble that contains not one, not two, but three Chrises (Pratt, Evans, and Hemsworth) hardly suggests that they’re trying very hard to branch out.
That is, until last Saturday, when at the biggest panel of the Super Bowl of pop culture, San Diego Comic Con, Marvel finally caught on. Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, went on stage and announced: “The Eternals,” to be directed by Chinese director Chloé Zhao, with an ensemble cast including a Mexican-American, Pakistani-American, and Korean-American superhero, as well as Marvel’s first deaf superhero, played by Lauren Ridloff; “Thor: Love and Thunder,” starring Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, the MCU’s first openly bisexual superhero; “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” a movie with an Asian-led cast, starring Tony Leung, Awkwafina (from “Crazy Rich Asians” and the ground-breaking “The Farewell), and Simu Liu (the unabashedly attractive older brother from “Kim’s Convenience”) as the titular superhero.
I know, it’s a lot.
Whether that’s a good thing or bad thing depends on who you ask. Some are applauding the studio for taking steps toward diversity. Others are accusing them of not being diverse enough and of being late or reactionary (weird how this big move happened only after “Black Panther“ broke box office records…). In the opinion of this writer, however, this is a good thing — remarkably so.
There’s an iconic moment in “Avengers: Endgame” where Ant-Man quips, “As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass,” directed, of course, at Captain America, himself, played by Chris number two.
Now, don’t get me wrong. I’ve gushed, many a time, about how hot Chris Evans is (and I doubt I’m the only one), and his ass is indeed a fine one. I just wonder why the face (and, evidently, buttocks) of America has to be of a blonde-haired, blue-eyed man white man, when the country itself is far from that Eurocentric ideal.
Because as much of a joke as “America’s Ass” is, it means something. These heroes represent the upper limit of what humanity can achieve, yes, in toned cheeks, but also in intellectual capability, emotional maturity, and moral integrity. They’re made into action figures and Halloween costumes for a reason — because they represent the values and ideals that we want to instill in our children.
Millions upon millions of people go see these movies. That’s a lot of people! More people than company diversity trainings or government awareness initiatives could ever hope to reach, much less actually influence. Granted, not everyone will see these new heroes (I doubt there’ll be much of “Thor: Love and Thunder” left for Chinese audiences to see once government censors cut out every trace of Valkyrie trying to find her queen), but for the many that still will, it will be an empowering statement. For Asian people, gay people, Hispanic people, disabled people — and hopefully, many more — this is a step in the right direction, one that says, “Yes. You, too, can be a superhero.”
A part of me still can’t help but continue to feel guilty. Corporations and movie studios hopping on the diversity train is hardly a new phenomenon, and whether or not they do so out of genuine support for marginalized peoples or simply to increase their bottom line is hard to say (although significantly less so, I think, in the case of the “Make America Great Again” pride hat). Applauding these companies is easy, but whether or not doing so is ethical is a question that marginalized and underrepresented communities will continue to grapple with in the years to come, and a question that I will continue to ask myself every time I watch that Marvel Studios opening logo sequence.
But what I do know for sure is how I feel. I cannot wait for “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” to come out. I cannot wait for the day when Simu Liu (who, in my opinion, is hot enough to give Chris Evans a run for his money — especially in the rear department) isn’t just Dr. Strange’s obligatorily serious sidekick or Spiderman’s token minority best friend. When amidst the inevitable flood of promotional posters and YouTube ads and Jimmy Fallon appearances that accompany every Marvel movie, I will finally see people who look like me. When Asian-Americans no longer have to look only to Facebook groups for cultural representation, but when they can find it on the big screen.
When he, along with the diverse array of superheroes (in every aspect of the word) that are a part of Marvel’s new phase of movies, can, together, take on the holy mantle that is “America’s ass.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
TOKYO, JAPAN – An early start to beat the heat and the throngs of tourists that visit Tokyo’s Imperial Palace meant that by 10 a.m., hunger had set in. Luckily, my friend’s dad had made me a little rice ball for the road. After carefully opening the plastic wrap, I finished the snack one graceful bite and started looking for a trashcan.
Five, then 10, and then 20 minutes went by without a single trash can in sight. We were near Tokyo Station, one of the busiest subway stops in the entire city, and there was nowhere for me to throw away the wrapper.
I turned around to ask my friend, who had lived in the United States for three years, if we would be able to find any trash cans on the streets.
She thought about my question for a minute and said no. No because they make the streets look dirty.
The streets were anything but dirty. There were no wrappers outside the fast food restaurants that lined the busy streets of Harajuku. None of the flyers being thrust into my hands as I walked down Ginza’s main avenue made their way onto the ground. I couldn’t even find cigarette butts in the sidewalk cracks of Shibuya, which are frequented by businessmen on their daily commutes.
The cleanliness of Tokyo, even in its busiest neighborhoods, felt almost alien. Responsibility for the state of one’s community is a foreign concept back home. We produce and dispose of trash without a second thought.
The senior citizens who monitor and pick up trash in tourist heavy areas understand this responsibility. The students who clean and differentiate between five kinds of recycling in their schools understand this responsibility, too.
Japan doesn’t need trash cans in the streets because their alternative to public bins isn’t littering. They care for their communities in the best way possible: keeping them clean.
Once I got back to my room, it took me a minute to dig into the bottom of my backpack and pull out the wrapper from that morning’s rice ball, along with an empty bottle of milk tea and some gum wrappers.
The trash I created had weighed me down all day. Throwing the items into the small plastic bin was easy, but I continue to carry their weight all across Japan as I teach young high school students about the ways our food choices impact the climate and how we are running out of time to make sure our communities and our lives can continue to flourish.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As summer ends and we think about classes to shop and reunions with friends, we may also think about how to re-engage with Harvard after a summer away. I’ve been away for over a year on my gap year, and during that time small things calcified Harvard’s image in my mind as a gloomy place. Out of the Harvard ecosystem, many friends felt safe to confide in me the depth of their struggles and loneliness. I talked with friends about the toxic environment in Winthrop House last semester under the leadership of former Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan. And I scrolled through the anonymous grim confessions on the Harvard Confessions Facebook page of students feeling unappreciated and unsupported. Harvard exists to serve its students, but sometimes that’s hard to seriously believe.
My answer is different this year than in years past when friends ask me how I feel about returning to campus. I tell them: this time, I’m collecting armor. During my gap year, I wrote down and sought out lessons about myself to remember when I returned, accruing an arsenal of stress-relief coping mechanisms. But my most cherished tool in this stockpile was one I never expected.
During my gap year, I started to dance Gaga.
Gaga is a movement language (as opposed to the rigidity of a dance “technique”). My instructor, Danielle Agami, who started training professionally at 18 under the founder of Gaga, Ohad Naharin, defined Gaga as using imagery, fantasy, and storytelling to practice our sense of humor, sense of self, and sense of composition. In class, people respond to visceral instructions like “imagine you are inside a balloon” or “your body is filling up with warm water” with free-flowing gestures in a mirror-less, judgement-free room. A key concept in Gaga is floating — resting the body with a “reasonable” amount of gravity while layering flow and softness. Agami carried floating naturally in her everyday posture and I try to mirror that in my own posture, holding my body with awareness and a little tension, a little softness.
The best part dancing Gaga is that my body’s rigidity from training as a swimmer for 15 years feels liberated. And when I unleashed my body, my mind followed. Instead of the paradigm of athletic training — when the mind believes, the body achieves — Gaga imagines the channel of mind and body as a two-way street. Another dancer I talked to, Laurienne Singer, agreed with me. She employs Gaga as a dance therapist for elder patients with debilitating diseases. Many of her patients experienced trauma at a young age and forced themselves to ignore it. Now when they are old, their past trauma is all they feel. She sees that paralleled in our modern metric-obsessed internet age, where people sit hunched over computers, never asking themselves how their gut feels. Though we are reaching pinnacles of discovery and innovation, we grow increasingly ignorant of our own machine. In her view, the body is our best teacher.
To Agami, Gaga fulfills this basic human need. It makes people feel that they’re reaching their full potential as a body, a human, and an animal. Gaga lets people feel legitimacy to be themselves. While dancers twist and explore their bodies, hopefully they’re reminded that their bones and flesh and skin (common guiding words in Gaga) are all they really own as humans. After this realization, the next step is to learn to derive pleasure from the body and to truly cherish it.
How different this is than on campus where my friend — now in graduate school — once remarked to me she felt like a “floating head.” That’s the reality in competitive elite environments: students overload back-to-back meetings, pull all-nighters, self-medicate, watch hours of Netflix, and scroll through Instagram. Out of boredom, fear, or fatigue, we mindlessly but desperately clutch anything that staves off introspection, feeling, vulnerability, failure. The pressure — the norm — of sacrificing ourselves in pursuit of immediate success enables us, so that most of the time we ignore the vehicle of our bodies and lose perspective.
Gaga pushes against these pressures by encouraging personal evolution and developing a long-term relationship with the body and its injuries. The overarching goal of this changing, evolving dance form is to help dancers research their own changing, evolving humanness. In Gaga, you’re not looking to achieve; you’re looking to experience.
I will remember this mantra into September, along with a Gaga technique, in times I am overwhelmed: feeling my spine and grounding myself. “Gaga is research of the questions: ‘What do we need?’ and ‘How do we get what we need?’” Agami asked, expectantly.
***
I left Harvard because I only saw the bad in it. But no one should return to Harvard with that mindset. Every time we come back, it should be with a renewed commitment to making the best of our time there. These lessons are bright kernels I bring back to campus (along with a commitment of taking Gaga classes offered at Harvard). Gaga is part of my arsenal for returning to campus, but I invite you to consider how and with what you will arm yourself with. For me, Gaga will sharpen my intuition for uphill battles of relentlessly curating activities and relationships that are worthy of my time and cutting out what isn’t. It will help me navigate questions between changing my attitude versus Harvard as an institution. Alongside writing papers, I will also carve time to research my imagination and my dreams.
But most of all, I will return with Agami’s wisdom imprinted in my mind — to create my own reality within Harvard: “You know the truth inside. You’re not the institution… You can give respect to the name and if they’re smart — which there is a chance they will be — they’ll learn from you.”
She ended with a light flick of her wrist. “And that’s the evolution of the institution.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Phillips Brooks House Association has delayed payment of stipends to roughly 50 summer program employees, which has presented difficulties for students across the organization’s programs, according to several student employees.
Employees across the approximately 20 PBHA summer programs faced delays, though there was no central problem that provoked the holdups, PBHA executive director Maria J. Dominguez Gray said in a July 17 interview.
PBHA offers its roughly 200 summer employees campus housing and two swipes to Harvard dining halls each week, but student stipends were meant to cover employees’ additional meal costs during the summer. The stipends range from several hundred dollars for part-time employees to several thousand for full-time.
Juliana Lamy ’20, Adult English for Speakers of Other Languages director, said the Adult ESOL PBHA program staff comprises three full-time instructors, who receive their stipends in weekly installments, and three part-time instructors, who receive their stipends as lump sums.
As of mid-July, full-time workers were fully compensated but part-time workers had not received their payment, according to Lamy.
“With my understanding of the program, we didn't have a set date for our part time instructors to receive their stipend,” she said. “That's, unfortunately, where a lot of confusion came from and something I’m going to be taking into consideration for the program next year.”
Lamy said Sunday that part-time workers’ stipends were currently being processed.
Albert B. Zhang ’22, a part-time Adult English for Speakers of Other Languages instructor, said Adult ESOL part-time instructors were initially promised a $500 stipend. Zhang said Sunday he has not yet received his payment.
He said he and the other instructors housed in the Radcliffe Quadrangle have struggled throughout the summer to pay for meals out of pocket and only have access to one small shared kitchen.
“As a means of sustaining ourselves, we really had to stretch ourselves,” Zhang said.
Grey Devlin — a member of Wellesely College Class of 2022 working at the Y2Y youth homeless shelter — said employees, who began working at the beginning of June, were promised a taxable stipend of $4000.
Based on “normal payment practices,” Devlin said she assumed she would be paid weekly or biweekly but received her first paycheck the third week of July — six weeks into the program.
“It's helpful that we can eat meals at the shelter with our guests,” Devlin said. “To some extent it's good for food waste, but I don't think that's the purpose of the food.”
Ruth H. M. Jaensubhakij ’22, a Summer Urban Program Chinatown Adventure senior counselor, said it was primarily her program’s senior counselors who experienced delays.
She said other employees in her program did not experience issues because directors were already in the payroll system as they were hired much earlier in the year, and the program’s high school level junior counselors are paid through the Massachusetts government.
“Most people started getting checks I would say either this week or last week, so there was definitely a delay,” she said.
PBHA offered cash advances to help employees pay for their meals if they requested them and also hosted barbeques to support those facing delayed stipends, Dominguez Gray said.
“We’ve done our best to try to make whole whenever there are things in our control with getting people real time cash advances so they weren’t struggling financially,” Dominguez Gray said. “We apologize for the frustration that [these delays] may have caused.”
Dominguez Gray said common causes behind delayed paychecks were errors in filling out payroll forms — for example, unsuitable photo identification or outdated addresses, especially for incoming sophomores whose addresses recently changed.
“It’s complicated, and it’s not the same for any two people,” she said. “But everybody has been collectively teaming around this with 20 different spreadsheets of different issues, going person by person to address the issues.”
Jaensubhakij, however, said she is grateful for the transparent and constant communication from PBHA leadership.
Lamy said PBHA’s finance staff was “super responsive” throughout the process.
“I really do feel like PBHA finance staff to the best of their ability did everything in their power to rectify the situation,” she said. “It never really felt like they were being super secretive about anything that was going on there.”
Dominguez Gray said the majority of the issues have been resolved and PBHA staff and student leadership have been working “around the clock” to fix the remaining issues.
“We're going to do a more in depth study in the next few weeks to get at the themes and the more systemic stuff that came out of those individual stories for next year,” she said.
