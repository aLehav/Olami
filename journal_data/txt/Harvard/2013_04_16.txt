After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s tough being pigeon-holed, and it’s even harder if the label that you have been assigned is more of a commercial one than an artistic one. The trick to dealing with this unenviable situation is figuring out how walk a narrow line between indulging your creative urges and staying true to your roots—and your fan base. Every group that has achieved financial success while maintaining a sense of artistic integrity has figured out this formula, and the ones that haven’t, well, haven’t.
Emo darlings Paramore have a serious case of the “too commercial to be creative” blues. They had a good thing going when they were founded in 2004. Lead singer Hayley Williams—then 14 years old—wrote tracks that were angry enough to attract rebellious pre-teens, but innocent enough to win the approval of worried parents. This, combined with the band’s Christian leanings and goth-punk look, won them a huge following and the attention of major record labels. However, 10 years and three albums later, Paramore haven’t really grown up with Williams. Their latest album, also called “Paramore,” is full of the same lackluster songwriting that has characterized their work from the beginning and, apart from a few tentative steps into new territory, shows a disappointing lack of ambition and creativity.
The tone of the album is perfectly encapsulated in its opening track, an energetic elegy homage to teen angst called “Fast Car.” The song is driven along by a steady 4/4 drum beat and is based around the sort of guitar licks that would be intriguingly dissonant if they weren’t polished to oblivion by sound effects and filters. Over this, Williams sings lyrics like “hollowed out and filled with hate / all we want is for you to give us a break,” which sound more than a little disingenuous coming from a woman with a decade of commercial success and recognition under her belt.
 “Paramore” moves along with this formula for a little over an hour, and its 17 tracks are divided into three sections by short “interludes” on which Williams accompanies herself on ukulele. These brief tracks—the longest is only a minute and a half long—provide the album with some of its freshest moments. The group takes a step back from its usual over-produced pop-punk sound and give Williams’s voice the space it needs to really shine. On “Interlude: Moving On,” her voice is clear and bright as she sings “I could be angry but you’re not worth the fight / besides I’m moving on.” These tracks are heartfelt and honest, and they express the band’s lyrical themes much better than anything else on the record. 
 Most of the faster songs on “Paramore” are virtually interchangeable: they feature the same sorts of inoffensive guitar lines and drum beats that Paramore have been writing since the beginning without any of the substance that would make them interesting. However, “Ain’t it Fun”—easily the best song on the album—finally breaks this mold. It opens with a jaunty, rhythmic xylophone line, quickly mirrored by guitar. As the band powers into the pre-chorus, the song bursts into a rhythm and chord progression that sounds more like a Quincy Jones-produced Michael Jackson song than a pop-punk track. Building on this theme, the break-down features a full, gospel-inspired chorus singing “don't go crying to your mama / because you’re on your own in the real world.” The result is Paramore at their best: a band capable of combining artistic influences while dressing them up in emo aesthetics. It’s just a shame more of their songs aren’t like this.
 The thing that is most disappointing about “Paramore” is how much of their actual songwriting acumen is visible underneath all of the overproduction and sound effects. When they take the time to step back and strip down their sound, or when they find the courage to step out of their box and  experiment with new styles, Paramore can actually write some good stuff. However, these well-written moments are buried underneath an endless wave of boring, derivative pop-punk. It almost sounds like they knew they could change it up, but they just chose not to.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The morning birds sang sweetly as I walked from Lamont Library at 4 a.m., carrying my heavy backpack to Mower A-11 for an hour of sleep after studying for the Life Sciences 1b final. It was the bittersweet sound of spring, the spring of 2011, when the sun rose when you wished it was dark and it set when you wished it was still bright.
I do not remember a point at which I was happy in that freshman spring semester. At the end of the semester, my attitude was confirmed when I saw that grade on my transcript: D+. It stood there like a demonic fire, making the C+ I received in Math 1b look like a Hoopes Prize. I had worked so hard, torturing my body and torturing my mind, for a D+ in a class that I loathed. It brought down my freshman year GPA to a 2.7. Frustratingly, although I really wanted to learn the material, I felt that the class could not teach it to me well. At the time, I couldn’t imagine how much that hellish freshman year would change my life for the better. It taught me a great deal about the importance of experiences, how they shape you and how you can use them against your fears, and it also taught me how flawed the GPA system is in assessing students’ success and its detrimental effect on students, especially on their mental health.
My freshman year began with such excitement, with the thought of all the great people I could meet, the awesome classes I could take, and the amazing activities I could engage in—only to end with depression. I only had a few close friends, and I was even afraid of opening up to them. I would go back to my room to try and hold back my tears. I spent my summer in a similar state, trying to figure things out. I felt so alone. I needed someone to talk to.
That summer, I spoke to a close friend about dealing with depression, and he recommended a book called “The Power of Intention.” The book’s ideas were enthralling to me: I decided to take up meditation. Soon, miraculously, it began to work, clearing my mind of negative thoughts. I had long forgotten what happiness felt like, but now I was beginning to remember. I started meditating daily. By meditating, I felt myself reaching a deep state of peace; positivity came flowing in. I could feel a strong presence, calmly assuring me that everything was going to be alright.
At the beginning of sophomore year, I decided to concentrate in organismic and evolutionary biology instead of molecular and cellular biology, relishing the big picture framework that it seemed to offer. That fall I took an advanced class in OEB—and I loved it. I also took two classes in religion, which impelled me to take up a secondary in that field. I had found my niche. After struggling with feeling alone, I finally decided to embrace Room 13 and the Bureau of Study Counsel. Though I do occasionally experience some depression,  I am now nowhere near the rut that I was once in.
Harvard is a place for personal growth in addition to academic growth, and experience—even struggle—is necessary for that growth. My grades have improved, but what is the point of getting good grades without any personal development in the process? Those with lower GPAs, like me, are a part of the Harvard community. Our voice is rarely heard, but it is about time that it is.
Our grades and our GPAs do not define who we are. They are constructs; they categorize you based on someone else’s parochial understanding of excellence. In reality, of course, only you can define who you are. We all came to Harvard because we could think out of the box, not because we could fit into it. So why should we fit into a box that someone else creates for us?
I have realized that the difficulty with using GPA in academics is that it is not as nuanced as the grade system. Whereas grades are meant to track your progress throughout a course, the GPA system only provides a picture on where you stand at the course’s conclusion. Unfortunately, we tend to use this holistic system in unhelpful ways—ways that tend to equate a number on a transcript with our own self-worth.
Students here contend with serious mental illnesses each and every day. It is important to consider these issues, and assure these students that they are not alone. But it is just as important to reconsider the kind of academic culture we promote. To promote good academic culture, we must believe in Harvard and we must believe in each other. It is our interpersonal experiences that help shape us, not our GPAs. The good moments will make us happy, and those dark spots that we are in at times will make us find the courage and the desire to move to higher ground. And when we get there, we realize that if it was not for that experience, we would not be on that higher ground. Every bad experience, at the end of the day, is just an opportunity in disguise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All sides have issued their fair share of bold statements and political gestures in the recent crisis surrounding North Korea’s nuclear threats. All relevant actors, from the U.S. government to the Chinese Politburo, from Ban Ki Moon to John F. Kerry, have made a statement, taken a stance or acted upon this burgeoning political meltdown. Undeniably, there is a lot at stake in this escalating conflict. It remains to be seen whether or not North Korea will launch an attack on South Korea, or maybe even on the United States. It is thus no surprise that the political situation on the Korean peninsula has been a constant and troubling source of the world’s attention in recent months.
Nonetheless, we cannot allow North Korea’s militarism and inflammatory rhetoric to distract us from the humanitarian concerns that plague the “Hermit kingdom.” Although North Korea’s lamentable political situation is intrinsically linked to the country’s dire food crisis and underdevelopment, we hope that the world can turn its attention away from the attention-seeking antics of North Korea’s regime and its new dictator and can turn its attention to pressing humanitarian concerns, especially mass starvation, the increase in tuberculosis contraction, and the recent expansion of concentration camps.
It would be naïve to assume that the world, especially the United States, could attempt to alleviate humanitarian problems in North Korea while ignoring North Korea’s labyrinthian political regime and its antagonistic approach to foreign policy and nuclear armaments. Following the recent ascension of Kim Jong Un to power, there has been much speculation that the young leader has been forced to prove himself to the older generals who wield most of the power in the communist one-party state. We can surely expect the recent nuclear threats made by Kim Jong Un to be the first of many expressions of internal dissent between the ranks of the leaders of the Workers’ Party of Korea, given speculated turmoil in the North Korean government.
Nonetheless, North Korea has been a focal point in East Asian geopolitical drama for the last few decades, and the rest of the world has previously navigated through political complications to provide humanitarian aid to North Korean civilians. It is imperative that we overcome current complications to continue to do so. Last year the UN reported that nearly a third of all children in North Korea are showing signs of dwarfism due to malnutrition and that only 40 percent of the $198 million they require for their humanitarian activities had been donated. Tuberculosis contraction in North Korea has also surged in association with starvation in the past two decades, but treatment for the disease is hard to come by. Satellite images have also recently revealed that Camp 14, one of the most infamous of North Korea’s many concentration camps, has expanded.
Five international aid non-profits have recently claimed that it has been almost impossible to deliver food aid to the civilian population for the past two years due to the U.S.’s neglect of the starvation of North Korean civilians. For example, North Korea broke an agreement with the United States in March 2012 by launching a satellite using a long range missile, prompting the U.S. State Department to cancel a planned donation of 240,000 tons of food aid.
Nations should not punish the civilian population of North Korea for the political infractions of North Korea’s government. This may be a tall order, but we must proportion the attention we give humanitarian issues in North Korea relative to that we give to the political ones.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At last weekend’s inspiring Women in the World Summit, Hillary Clinton passionately declared once again that “women rights are human rights, and human rights are women’s rights once and for all.” This rousing message was reiterated and reaffirmed in different ways throughout the two-day summit. Whether it was a rousing panel on maternal health in Western Africa or a discussion on education for girls in Pakistan, the speakers of the summit all insisted on declaring that violations of women’s rights are violations of human rights; therefore, everyone, not just women, should rise to protest them.
And yet, why is that so much of the time it seems as though women are shouldering this battle alone? Why is it that so often, people are so quick to flee from an issue that has any sort of “go women!” connotation? Globally, and more specifically here at Harvard, I urge more men to step up to the plate by speaking out louder to stop violations against women and to make more of an effort to be part of the conversation surrounding women’s rights.
Of course, there are countless men who are already working hard to ensure equality and respect for women. Perhaps one of my favorite speakers from Women in the World this year was a male activist named Ravi Kant, who participated in a panel on violence against women in India. Ravi, along with his two brothers, runs Shakti Vahini, an Indian organization that works to combat human trafficking. Kant pressed men at the summit to fight for the rights of their daughters, mothers, and wives. Similarly, Harvard is not without its dedicated male women’s rights activists. Student organization Harvard Men Against Rape does excellent work to encourage male students to speak out against rape, which disproportionately affects female students.
And yet, both globally and here at Harvard, I find that men like Ravi or members of HMAR are the exception to the rule. Although Ravi fights every day for justice, there are many men who believe and accept as a reality that “if girls look sexy, boys will rape.” Although countless men around the globe believe in women’s rights, it is harder to find men that are actively fighting for them or vocalizing their importance. It is common for these issues to either by dismissed or mocked.
At Harvard specifically, while I believe that most men truly believe in equal treatment for all, this belief often does not translate into action. Male students are much more hesitant to voice their support for feminist issues than women. Let’s take the now very exhausted topic of Tyga singing at Yardfest, for example. The day that the infamous news was announced, my Facebook was flooded with posts from female students who felt outraged that someone so misogynistic had been chosen to play for our spring event. I counted one or two posts from guys, but not many. This may seem to make sense upon first glance: Tyga’s offensive lyrics are directed at women, so of course, more women are going to be angry than men. But male students should be just as upset that an artist whose lyrics present utter contempt for women had the chance to voice that sentiment on Saturday. Tyga evidently doesn’t care, as he made clear when he eloquently said, “fuck the haters.” But we should. Words that are offensive to women are offensive to everyone.
I believe that there is a stigma attached to men advocating for women’s rights, at least on Harvard’s campus, and this needs to change. I have heard many people assume that a guy is gay because he is attending an event on women’s empowerment or encouraging people to attend Take Back the Night events. I have been reprimanded, in a friendly way, by guy friends for being obsessed with “women’s issues.” We need to change this strange conception of masculinity. Just because a man supports and speaks out for women’s rights does not mean he’s “feminine” (god forbid!). This misconception impedes progress. I cannot help but call to mind a scene from Tom Wolfe’s “I Am Charlotte Simmons” in which a hypocritical character fears attending a gay rights rally because he is terrified that girls will assume he’s not straight.
If more men include themselves in this discussion, it will start to seem less “cool” to be anti-woman. So much of the time, peer pressure and fear of undesired interpretations prohibit the issuance of vocal support. If fighting for women can become accepted among men, the power will increase. So to the guys reading this, in the next few weeks, I encourage you to join some “lean in” circles, attend some Take Back the Night events, and join in actively in dining hall discussions—maybe even begin them. I’m not asking you to immediately start storming the Yard with “Hillary 2016” posters. I am asking you to take a first step.
You don't have to be a woman to stand up for women's rights. You don't have to be black to stand up for equal rights for African-Americans or gay to be repelled by homophobia. You don’t have to be a tree to be an advocate for a greener environment. You just have to be a civilized human being. I implore my fellow beings to exert more action, first from on campus and then into the world.

Washington is awash with apocalyptic prophecies of the national deficit as some sort of looming catastrophe. Casting themselves as clairvoyant Cassandras, politicians like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell call debts and deficits “the transcendent issue of our era.”
Deficit hawks, bolstered by self-interested billionaires like Pete Peterson, campaign for severe entitlement reforms, including raising the age at which seniors receive Social Security benefits. The fiscally austere mistake the deficit as a result of runaway government spending instead of weak demand caused by the recession, where deficits actually improve overall demand.
Comparing the economic recoveries, or lack thereof, of countries from the most recent recession best illustrates this Keynesian point. Great Britain’s austerity program, once applauded when ushered in by Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron, has driven the economy to a possible triple-dip recession.
Ireland’s “admirable lesson in fiscal responsibility,” as hailed in 2010 by Alan Reynolds of the conservative Cato Institute think-tank, has instead provided disappointingly low growth and a severe, stubborn 14 percent unemployment rate. Contrary to philippics of the deficit hawks, deficit reduction is not a panacea that restores confidence — it destroys prosperity.
With a dysfunctional Congress consistently shooting the country in the foot, embracing fiscal austerity in America would shoot ourselves in the other foot to ensure the country couldn’t even limp onward.
Organizations like Fix the Debt are fearmongerers, with warnings like “if we don’t act now on our own terms, the markets will force action through a severe economic crisis,” cripplingly high interest rates, and generational injustice. The prognostications miss the basic economic point that deficits in depressed economies do not increase inflation or interest rates.
An undercurrent of xenophobia commonly runs through attacks that denounce borrowing from China as some sort of existential threat to the country’s freedom.
The truth is that Chinese holdings of American debt are rapidly falling, and Japan may soon be the largest foreign owner of American debt. Moreover, China’s dependence on American consumers for its exports puts the economic vitality of America squarely in its own self-interest. Any conspiracy to ruin America’s economy would severely ruin its own.
In fact, medium-term budget concerns about the debt-to-GDP ratio have been mostly solved by the $1.5-trillion cuts of 2011 and the $600-billion tax increases in the fiscal cliff deal. The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Public Priorities has called for an additional $1.4 trillion in cuts over the next ten years to stabilize the debt at 70 percent.
In the long-term, however, the demographic shift to an older population along with the increasing healthcare costs of higher quality medical technologies pose a significant challenge to the country’s finance. And it is here that the deficit scolds may be right when it comes to urging entitlement reforms, albeit for the wrong reasons.
Congressional Democrats and liberals should, in fact, support Social Security reform for the simple reason that the program is no longer as progressive as initially intentioned. Middle- and upper-class workers have much higher life expectancies than their poorer counterparts—a gap that’s expected to increase as income inequality expands and the cost of medical technology skyrockets. As a result, middle- and upper-class Americans tend to accrue much higher total lifetime benefits, leaving the system much less progressive.
And $100 billion in benefits go to employer-sponsored retirement programs, flowing almost entirely to upper- or middle-class workers, since lower-class workers often have neither the opportunity or financial resources to participate in such programs. Congressional action to slow the growth of benefits to middle- and high-income earners could reduce two-thirds of the $4.8 trillion long-term deficit of the program.
But Democrats are fearful of meaningful entitlement reform, while Republicans remain poisoned by the anti-tax ideological extremism of the Norquist flavor. The state of the deficit and entitlement debate, where the parties prefer simplistic mantras to reasoned and rational debate, points to the stunning inability of both sides to give up their sacred cows. With the more gerrymandered districts now in play, members of Congress appeal to constituents with increasingly absolutist stances that severely cripple the ability of our legislature to produce substantive bills, as evidenced by the 112th Congress, which earned the dubious distinction of being the least productive in history.
So while the deficit hawks targeting entitlement programs might spur a beneficial rethinking of entitlements, the crowd has warned of impending economic doom far too many times to be taken seriously.
As much as they may insist, the sky isn’t falling.

The marathon is a tribute to the Athenian messenger who ran from the town of Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory over Persia. According to legend, he announced ”Rejoice!  We conquer!” before dying of exhaustion. The story is filled with conflicting feelings of triumph and tragedy.
Monday was also a day of triumph and tragedy. 17,584 runners, smiling or grimacing, crossed that finish line to feelings of overwhelming pride. At 2:50 p.m. two remotely detonated bombs exploded. 4,496 runners did not cross the finish line. More than 170 people were injured. Three people did not survive.
At 2:51 I was stopped a few blocks from the finish line by a dense crowd of runners. Through the confusion, a woman shouted, “Stay loose, runners!” So, disoriented and with nothing else to do, we all started stretching. Then I overheard the words “bomb threat” from a man talking to his wife. I walked over to the spectators as the crowd of runners began to swell. Apparently, someone reported a bomb. Then I saw the smoke, the police, the firemen, and the worried faces. Next thing I knew, I had scaled a fence and was running on adrenaline and unyielding legs towards shelter across the Charles.
I remembered running the Boston Marathon last year in 90-degree heat thinking this was the worst it could get. How could I have been so naïve? But then, how could I have known? I ran right into my Spanish class about 20 minutes late. The professor interrupted his lecture to kindly inquire, “Cómo fue el maratón?”
I could not describe how the marathon was, let alone in Spanish. All I could muster was, “There was a bomb.”
But Monday was not just a tragedy. There were stories of inspiration as well. There was heroism and ingenuity in the wake of the horrific bombing.  As I ran for shelter in the safety of my campus, others ran on to donate blood at local hospitals for the wounded. Within a couple hours, Google and the Red Cross had created websites to locate lost loved ones after the disaster. I received emails from alumni who opened their homes and hearts to stranded runners in Boston as bomb threats continued to roll in across the greater Boston area.
And there were the “regular” heroes, who perform quiet acts of inspiration routinely.
I saw runners running for the cure of nearly every known disease. There were runners running in memory of loved ones, or expectant parents for expected loved ones. I paced a friend, vicariously experiencing the pure joy and wonder of a first time marathoner. I ran alongside the visually impaired, the handicapped, and their guides. I watched with a mixture of admiration and embarrassment as men three times my age ambled past me. There were military personnel of all stripes running in their heavy packs and boots.
Just as inspiring were the spectators along the sidelines. There were drum circles, dances, costumes, and megaphones. There was a constant outpouring of support from the Wellesley Scream Tunnel to the entertainingly inebriated Boston College students.  All along the course there were signs reading, “The Kenyans are behind you!” or “Run like you stole something” or “Kiss me because-I’m Irish-I’m Jewish-I’m Italian-I’m Presbyterian-Just because!” Little children handed out cold otter pops to weary, grateful runners.
The marathon showed the heroes who rose to the occasion, and the heroes who needed no occasion to rise.
Both kinds of heroes inspire us by the sheer magnitude of their individual willpower.  If we are tempted to despair in the face of the horror caused by a few contemptible individuals, these thousands rescue us and awe us by the spectacle of their humanity and resilience.
Perhaps tomorrow or in a few days we will see the face or faces of those behind these attacks. They will flood our minds with hate and disgust. But let us not forget that it was also a day of triumph.
For many, finishing the Boston Marathon is something to cross off a bucket list. For others, the Boston Marathon is their chance to find a cure. A few run to win, some run for time, most run to finish. Ultimately, however, the marathon is about the endurance of the human spirit. Yesterday there was tragedy. But the human spirit endures, and by enduring, triumphs.
Rejoice, we conquer.

While the Harvard community struggled to comprehend the news of deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon, several dozen students gathered at Harvard Hillel Monday to commemorate Yom HaZikaron, Israel’s day of remembrance for fallen soldiers and victims of terrorism.
Hillel staff member Dana Silberstein called the Israeli Memorial Day holiday “oddly more relatable” in light of the day’s events. One speaker changed his speech in light of the bombing, choosing to quote American author John Steinbeck and discuss the United States and Israeli militaries rather than give the speech he had originally written. Multiple speakers mentioned that while violence is unusual in American daily life, it is far more common for the Israeli people.
“It’s crazy timing, with the Boston Marathon explosions,” Beth I. Drucker ’13 said.
In recognition of the holiday, Hillel offered a talk by visiting history professor Benny Morris of Ben-Gurion University in Israel. Students also marked the occasion by delivering speeches.
Yom HaZikaron, which became a national holiday in Israel in 1963, features traditions including silence, prayers, the sounding of a siren, remembrance of deceased family and friends, and flags flown at half-staff. Attendees explained that the day is similar to Memorial Day in the United States.
The event, and the holiday, closed at sunset with a reception complete with music, falafel, and baklava. The reception marked the beginning of Yom Ha’atzmaut, Israel’s Independence Day.

As Harvard affiliates anxiously awaited news from loved ones running or attending the tragedy-marred Boston Marathon Monday afternoon, House communities, peer advising groups, and concerned individuals created spaces where they could come together to try to make sense of the day's events.
Two bombs exploded on the north side of Boylston Street at 2:50 p.m. Monday, puncturing what is usually a day of celebration and achievement with fear and sorrow. The explosions killed three and injured more than 100 at the race’s finish line, and unconfirmed bomb threats and scares continued in Boston and Cambridge throughout the afternoon.
In an email to the Cabot House open email list, House Master Stephanie R. Khurana invited students to join her and Co-House Master Rakesh Khurana in the Cabot Private Dining Room, writing that “difficult moments are better spent together.”
Stephanie Khurana later wrote in an email to The Crimson that the gathering allowed students to reflect on the tragedy by sharing stories about their experiences. When marathon runners from Cabot returned to the House, waiting students welcomed them home with hugs of relief, Khurana added.
“One student just said to me that she feels so lucky to come home to a community where several dozen people can be together during such a trying time,” Khurana wrote.
Students involved with peer counseling groups on campus, such as Room 13 and Response, also sent emails over House lists encouraging their classmates to utilize their groups’ resources.
“It was important that we reach out to students on campus and make sure they knew that we were a resource that could be used,” said Alyssa R. Leader ’15, one of a group of undergraduate women who are counselors with Response. Although it generally addresses relationship and sexual assault issues, the group wanted students to know that they could turn to peer counselors in the wake of tragedy as well.
Outpouring of support came not just from groups but also from individuals keen to mitigate the burden of concern and sadness.
Brendan S. Eappen ’16 learned of the tragedy after finishing a midterm. The news was especially worrying because his mother was running in the race. After finding out that she was safe, Eappen decided he wanted to help others who were stressed or scared by the incident and posted on the Harvard Class of 2016 Facebook group that he would be happy to talk.
“I wanted to give people the opportunity to know they have support, know that it’s okay to feel dissettled by this,” said Eappen. “It is scary when it’s something so close to home, if they know somebody who was involved, nearly involved, or could have been involved.”
Celena C. Tyler ’14 and her roommate CiCi C. McMullen ’14 offered up their dorm room to “anyone looking for community, support, or friendship” in an email over her House list.
“I wanted to offer students an opportunity to connect as students because even though we have resources through the College and through campus organizations, a lot of the time I feel like the most meaningful support can come from the community that is most close to home,” said Tyler.

UPDATED: April 16, 2013, at 3:15 a.m.
The tweets started circulating just before three in the afternoon.
Nicandro G. L. Iannacci ’13 was meeting with a professor at the John F. Kennedy School of Government when he checked his Twitter feed and saw the first mentions of an alleged bombing at the Boston Marathon.
Inesha N. Premaratne ’15 was in a government class when she scanned through her own feed and saw that several explosions had been reported near the race.
Isamar J. Vega ’13 did not even have a Twitter account when the day began, but she decided to set one up to follow the unfolding tragedy.
By Monday evening, the facts had been made clear: at least three were dead and more than 130 injured by two bombs detonated near the Boston Marathon finish line at Copley Square. But for much of the day, the truth was more opaque. With cell phone service in Boston down and TV news slow to sort out the details, members of the Harvard community turned to Twitter and other forms of social media to find and exchange the latest news about the bombings.
“Obviously there are upsides and downsides to this, but when you are lacking any kind of centralized information...it’s good to have an aggregate of different sources from people who were there,” said Kathleen E. French ’13, who was also very active on Twitter following the explosions.
But that absence of authoritative information—whether from law enforcement in Boston struggling to sort out the details of the bombings or from Harvard officials who remained quiet for several hours as unconfirmed bomb threats emerged around the Harvard Square area—allowed for a lot of misinformation, Twitter users on campus said.
From inflated death counts to a fake Boston Marathon Twitter account, it was at times difficult to sort through fact and fiction, students said.
“For me, to differentiate between information and misinformation was to see multiple authoritative people saying the same thing,” Iannacci said. “The danger of Twitter is one tweet going far if it’s not true.”
In particular, confusion over a dozen Cambridge Police Department tweets reporting potential threats, including several in the Harvard Square area, alarmed many students and faculty. All but one of those threats were investigated and cleared on Twitter by CPD as of press time early Tuesday morning.
Still, as police evacuated the Kennedy School and guards shut down vehicle gates into Harvard Yard, those following the reports online began to take precaution.
French said the CPD reports prompted her to stay indoors.
“I think that the Cambridge updates probably did freak people out,” she said. “It certainly scared me, but they were threats that the department was receiving, so it was not worth taking lightly.”
Iannacci agreed, saying that with a lot of misleading information circulating on Twitter, the police feed was the “ultimate authority.”
“I trusted the Cambridge Police Twitter,” Iannacci said. “To say that they created unsubstantiated fear is in some sense good, because they are doing their job and informing us as they learned that information.”
By late Monday, CPD tweeted its own response to critics of the reports.
“Tweets of INCIDENT/BOMBS/THREATS do not mean ppl making false reports. Means reporting what they see as suspicious & we respond 2 investigate,” the department wrote, adding in another tweet that the reports were triggered by unattended bags, clothing, and garbage.
While Harvard affiliates turned to Twitter in search of news after the bombing, they largely turned to other social networks to share the information they had. Facebook became a forum for Harvard affiliates to express grief and reassure friends and family members far from Cambridge that they were safe. Many House email lists featured long exchanges verifying the whereabouts and condition of various students who had been at the marathon. On its website, The Crimson compiled and published a list of University affiliates who had either run or attended the race and had been confirmed to be safe.
Within the broader Boston community, people turned to these and other platforms to offer news and resources. Google set up a site early in the day to help identify missing persons, and individuals throughout the area, including several Harvard affiliates, listed their information on a spreadsheet offering out-of-town runners places to stay for the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of two bomb explosions that killed three people and injured more than 130 others, Harvard students criticized what they described as the University’s slow communication with undergraduates.
The bombs at the finish line of the Boston Marathon exploded around 2:50 p.m. on Monday afternoon. By 3:51 p.m., the Cambridge Police Department had tweeted about a potential bomb threat in Central Square that was later cleared. For the next two hours, Harvard undergraduates were inundated with tweets, news articles, and alerts about potential bomb threats in the Cambridge, including several near Harvard’s campus. The University sent out its first email communication regarding the incident to the entire Harvard community at 5:17 p.m.
Following the more than two-hour gap between the first reports of the incident and the University-wide response, messages from the administration came in quick succession. Over the next one and a half hours, undergraduates received emails about the incident from Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. At around 6:20 p.m., undergraduates subscribed to the University-wide alert system MessageMe received a communication notifying them of the cancellation of Monday evening classes. MessageMe, an opt-in notification service, sends news alerts to members of the Harvard community via text, email, and voicemail.
Christopher C. Walleck ’14 was among the many students who told The Crimson that he thought the message from Harvard should have come sooner. Walleck first heard about the Boston Marathon bombing through a text message from a blockmate at 3:30 p.m. By the time he first heard from Harvard, he already had received “dozens of emails” from friends, student organizations, and peers in Cabot House.
“I hadn’t received so much as a single message from Harvard saying, ‘Stay in your dorms,’ or ‘Be safe,’ or simply what to be mindful of, and I found that extremely perturbing,” said Walleck, who subscribes to the MessageMe.
In an email to The Crimson, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote that MessageMe “is reserved for situations in which we have an imminent threat or when we are asking members of the Harvard community to take a specific action in a short timeframe.” Because the cancellation of classes required Harvard affiliates to immediately alter their plans, Neal said, administrators chose to communicate that decision through the service.
Students at the Harvard Kennedy School also received MessageMe notification at 4:57 p.m. informing them that their campus was being evacuated.
Sabrina N. Bukenya ’16 said she was disappointed that administrators took “a while” to respond to the incident, leaving students confused about the status of their classes and exams.
Benjamin K. Moss ’13 wrote in an email that he thinks the University’s “lack of communication” left students “helpless and confused” and facilitated the spread of misinformation about such things as locked gates in the Yard.
“For two and half hours, all the student body heard from University Hall was a deeply unsettling silence,” wrote Moss.
But other students interviewed said they thought the University’s response was appropriate given the circumstances.
Lakshmi Parthasarathy ’14 said she thought that since the explosions did not happen on campus, it was not the University’s responsibility to immediately respond to the incident.
Undergraduates said they appreciated the actions of their resident deans, tutors, and House Masters, who spent Monday afternoon and evening reaching out to students in Boston and on campus.
Leverett and Winthrop House administrators used House email lists to solicit names of Harvard affiliates present at the marathon, staff from multiple Houses urged students to tap into services on campus such as Mental Health Services and the Bureau of Study Counsel, and Adams House sent a message to students Monday evening confirming that all Adams students were safe.
Marathon runner Jessica A. Wright ’14, who was personally contacted by a House administrator, said she was “livid” about the timing of the University’s official email communication, but that staff “did a good job of contacting” Harvard marathon participants. Members of the Dunster House staff and some teaching fellows contacted Alana I. Ganz ’15, who said she appreciated their efforts to ensure her safety.
Hammonds echoed the messages of House administrators in her email later in the evening, encouraging students to send their resident deans the names of Harvard affiliates present at the Boston Marathon, as well as to utilize House administrators and MHS as resources if “struggling with [the] incident.”
In an interview with The Crimson, Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14 praised students for working together to confirm that their peers who had been at the marathon were safe.
“I hope that we can learn as a community from these tragic incidents and improve communications in the future,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just around the corner from the Boston Marathon finish line, Erick M. Juarez ’15, one of more than 90 Harvard affiliates who attended the Marathon, was calmly walking back to Harvard’s campus at 2:50 p.m. on Monday after watching the race.
But then the ground shook.
At first, he thought the construction crew working on a building down the street had dropped a heavy object. As smoke billowed overhead and shouting runners and spectators sprinted past him, Juarez realized that the truth was far more sinister. Turning around, Juarez made his way towards the source of the chaos, fueled by both an “innate curiosity” and a desire to help, he said.
Arriving at the intersection of Boylston and Exeter Streets, Juarez witnessed paramedics carrying stretchers with bloodied runners and spectators—a grim scene caused by two explosions moments earlier. Police officers shouted over the wails of crying children. Ambulance sirens soon blared overhead, adding to the hysteria as more people fled the site of the bombings.
“I just stayed there for a little while watching, trying to absorb, thinking that it could have been me,” he said.
Three people died and more than 130 were injured, though as of press time there were no confirmed reports of Harvard faculty, students, or staff suffering injuries due to the blast.
The disaster was an unexpected twist to a historic day that has traditionally been an opportunity to celebrate.
Dennis J. Purcell, Jr. ’13 was excited for the 117th Boston Marathon to be his first.
“Everyone’s spirits were up,” he said. “It was just a fun day.”
Purcell had nearly reached the 25th mile marker when he heard mention of an explosion from runners and spectators. Thinking nothing of it, he continued his race. But with only one mile left, his mother and sister emerged from the crowd and frantically guided him off the course.
Like Purcell, many other Harvard affiliates felt disoriented by the thundering blasts.
Hearing the sound of explosions, Kendall P. Crawford ’16 thought celebrations of the race’s finish might include the firing of a cannon.
Crawford, who waited near the finish line to support a fellow Harvard student, did not realize anything unusual had occurred until a second explosion erupted behind her.
“After the second one I think [it] really hit me that ‘oh my god I could die,’” Crawford said. “‘This is big.’”
Though he had finished the race when the bombs exploded, competitor Beau M. Feeny ’13 said he heard the blast from a friend’s apartment on Dartmouth Street.
Feeny said he immediately thought of the friends who had come to watch him in the race.
“It was terrifying,” he said. “I knew that I had asked a bunch of friends to come and watch me and they weren’t accounted for.”
Spectators at the finish line reported screaming children, blaring ambulances, and mass hysteria as people fled the scene.
Crawford said she saw other spectators tearing down the barricades separating the bystanders from the runners as they attempted to flee the finish line area.
“My friend and I just grabbed each other and stood there in absolute fear,” she said.
As Juarez returned to the scene of the explosion, he witnessed a chaotic mass of people, some frozen in confusion, others fleeing the streets.
“There were a lot of children crying, which really got to me,” he said. “It was very shocking, very out of place. It made me wonder why stuff like this happened.”
Harleen K. Gambhir ’14, who attended the race as a spectator, approached the finish line as the bombs exploded.
“I had a moment when I thought that everything might blow and there would be nowhere to run to,” she said. “A woman near me fell immediately and started screaming and crying.”
Many terrified Harvard runners and spectators expressed gratitude that they remained unscathed.
“I’m really thankful that I hadn’t run it a little faster,” Purcell said. “Unfortunately I couldn’t finish, but it could have been a lot worse.”
Juarez said he had considered going to the marathon’s finish line to take a photo, but ultimately he had decided against it.
“Had I made my way there a few minutes earlier I might have been a victim,” he said. “I thank God that that didn’t happen.”
With streets and nearby Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority stations closed and taxis at a premium, Harvard affiliates encountered difficulty as they tried to make their way back to campus.
Feeny was among many who said they walked most or all of the way from Back Bay to Cambridge.
Harvard University Police Department officers and Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service, offered rides to students stranded in downtown Boston.
Many Boston-based alumni of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, a program that allows helps students secure a spot in the race, offered their support to Crimson runners, according to Craig F. Rodgers, a counselor at the Bureau of Study Counsel who also coordinates the Challenge.
“We are blessed to be part of such a wonderful, close community here at Harvard,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than twenty-four hours after two bombs exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing at least three and injuring at least 176, government officials and investigators met the media at a hotel near the blast zone to report that the investigation of the bombings is ongoing and rapidly growing in scope.
Massachusetts Gov. Deval L. Patrick ’78 led a press conference Tuesday morning that included Boston mayor Thomas M. Menino, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis, who announced an updated casualty count: 176 wounded—17 of them critically—and three dead.
Davis said that the finish area had been swept for explosives on two occasions Monday morning, both hours before the explosions. Asked by a reporter why those searches had not turned up any devices, he said that because of the length of the racecourse, “people can come and go and brings items in and out.”
Rick  DesLauriers, the FBI Special Agent-in-Charge who is leading the investigation into the incident, also refused to speculate on why the bomb sweeps failed to detect the explosives. Additionally, he would not reveal if the FBI is guarding any potential suspects, as was reported widely yesterday. DesLauriers did say that the investigation is ongoing and that “there is no known imminent threat.”
Officials at the press conference also rejected reports that spread rapidly yesterday alleging the discovery of as many as five additional explosive devices.
“Responding to rumors—there were reports out there that there were seven devices—that is not true,” said Gene Marquez, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. “I think [those reports] happened as a result of some suspect packages that were disrupted. But we only have two devices that we are aware of. Both those devices were the ones involved in the explosive incident.”

In its final test before the Ivy League Championships, the Harvard women’s golf team placed third out of 14 northeastern colleges at the two-day Brown BEAR Invitational in Barrington, R.I., Monday.
The Crimson shot 47-over-par after two rounds to finish behind first-place Yale (+28) and runner-up Seton Hall (+45). St. John’s redshirt junior Jennifer Neville won a playoff over Boston University sophomore Kristyna Pavlickova and Yale sophomore Sun Gyoung Park to place atop the individual leaderboard after finishing round two three-over.
“I’m pretty pleased with our overall performance,” said junior captain Bonnie Hu, who is also a Crimson business editor. “I think, going into Ivy’s, we have a better sense of what areas we need to work on.”
Hu paced Harvard with a nine-over performance to finish in a five-way tie for seventh place among 84 individual entrants. On Sunday, Hu shot three-over to share the lead with the eventual top-three finishers after the first round.
“Bonnie played well for the team [Sunday] and continues her good, strong play,” Crimson coach Kevin Rhoads said. “She’s been dealing with a back injury, but that’s been behaving itself, and she’s managed that well.”
The Crimson turned in an even two days at Rhode Island Country Club, tallying 312 stokes on Sunday and 311 strokes on Monday. On Sunday, Harvard finished three strokes behind Yale and six strokes ahead of Seton Hall, but the Bulldogs and the Pirates surged ahead on Monday, turning in 295- and 303-stroke efforts in the final round.
“Yale definitely played really well today,” Hu said. “Going into Ivy’s, it’s really hard to base things on this tournament. Obviously, it would have been nice to have done better at this tournament, but I’m not too concerned that they beat us.”
Freshman Courtney Hooton finished 11-over to place 13th overall and contributed the Crimson’s best second-round score with a score of four-over on Monday. Classmate Christine Lin finished a stroke behind in a six-way tie for 14th after shooting six-over on both days of competition.
Sophomore Tiffany Lim had four birdies on Monday to finish 18-over in a tie for 29th. Brenna Nelsen, who is also a Crimson sports editor, shot eight-over on Sunday but was forced to withdraw after round one because of a lingering foot injury.
“She’s been keeping [the injury] under control, but it flared up and acted up,” Rhoads said of Nelsen. “She was able to finish the round, but it was pretty severe, and she was in a lot of pain.”
The Crimson could not drop its lowest score on Monday because of Nelsen’s withdrawal. With Hu’s and Nelsen’s ailments, one of Harvard’s main concerns now is to get healthy before the Ivy League Championships begin on April 26 in Bedminster, N.J.
“There’s a little bit of adversity, and we need to be stronger and rise above that,” Rhoads said. “I think we will be up to that challenge.”
The invitational was Harvard’s first tournament in New England since the fall. The recently treated greens proved slow at times on a cold and windy first day of competition. The top five teams improved on their round one scores Monday.
“I think putting was probably our biggest challenge in the first round, but it was for everyone else as well,” Rhoads said.
Harvard’s third-place finish comes a week after an 11th-place showing at the Rebel Intercollegiate at Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss. Hu believes that the team is headed in the right direction.
“I thought our scores didn’t really reflect everyone’s game and where they are at with their game,” Hu said. “I think that there’s definitely room for us to improve because people were playing well, but their scores weren’t necessarily coming together.”
While the Crimson lost to first-place Yale this weekend, Harvard defeated Ivy League rivals Columbia (fourth place, +51), Dartmouth (10th place, +74) and Brown (11th place, +76). In New Jersey, Harvard will look to defend its 2012 team title, while Hu will try to defend her individual title.
“Everyone’s almost there, but no one’s super-sharp right now,” Rhoads said. “That’s going to be our primary goal in the next week, trying to get as sharp as possible as we head into Ivy’s.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To get his first win of the season, junior pitcher Sam Dodge went the extra mile. After losing his previous six decisions, Dodge threw a complete game against Yale (8-21, 5-7 Ivy) on Sunday, surrendering just one unearned run and three hits against seven strikeouts. He threw 104 pitches and helped the Harvard baseball team (8-24, 5-7) to a four-game split with the Bulldogs.
“As a catcher, I always feel confident when Sam takes the mound that he will always keep us in the game,” freshman backstop DJ Link said. “He throws hard, has good offspeed [pitches], and throws strikes. He did a great job on Saturday throwing strikes and letting the defense behind him work.”
Despite his winless record, Dodge still ranked near the top of the team in numerous statistical categories even before Saturday. He is second on the team with more than 38 innings pitched and has the fourth-best ERA. His seven strikeouts per game is best on the team among pitchers who have thrown at least 20 innings, and he leads the team with 31 strikeouts along with just 14 walks.
“Sam has improved on a lot of things this year,” sophomore Brandon Kregel said. “His tempo is a lot better this year, and his mound presence has improved. He’s not afraid to throw pitches that are hittable because he has confidence in our defense. He doesn’t walk as many people. He has a lot of confidence in his curveball and offspeed stuff and delivers when he needs to.”
Kregel said that having a pitcher who is confident in his abilities and is willing to pitch to contact has positive trickle-down effects for the rest of the team.
“It gives everybody a lot of overall confidence,” Kregel said. “Having him pitch to contact and not being afraid to throw the ball down the middle or anywhere the batter can hit says a lot because he is trusting the defense rather than trying to work around the strike zone and walking people.”
Dodge has gone the distance in his last two starts, pitching six innings in the other to save the arms of Harvard’s relief pitchers. After starting the season slowly, posting eight walks against eight strikeouts in his first three starts, the junior has reversed the ratio and posted a 21-to-five strikeout-to-walk split in his last three starts.
“Over the past year, my biggest improvement has probably been in my ability to be consistently in the strike zone and attack hitters,” Dodge said. “Getting ahead in the count is huge. It allows you to try to make the hitter chase pitches out of the strike zone. Because I’ve been getting ahead in more counts, that has opened up more chances for me to use all of my pitches and locate them to try and get a swing and miss.”
Dodge said that his main takeaway from his weekend performance was using multiple pitches to confuse opposing batters and take advantage of his varied arsenal on the mound.
“Attacking hitters is goal number one,” Dodge said. “One thing that was very important this week and will be in the future is throwing [all] three pitches—fastball, curveball, changeup—for strikes. It is huge in keeping the hitters off balance and unsure of what’s coming next. It’s pretty easy to time up a fastball if a guy can’t throw other pitches for strikes, so continuing to work on my curveball and changeup is really important. Continuing to do that over the next couple weeks will definitely give us a better chance to win.”
Dodge’s success has coincided with the team’s improved play over the course of the season. After losing 17 of the first 20 games that it played, the team has won five of its last 10 Ivy League contests. Kregel said that as the season has gone along, the team has found confidence in themselves, a key part of the late season surge.
“At the beginning of the year in preseason practice, we didn’t know what to think because we had lost everybody…and the open spots were going to be filled by young players without much experience,” Kregel said. “Now that we are well into the season, we trust in our abilities, and people are starting to prove themselves. We see that as long as everyone stays together and produces when necessary that we can do a lot of damage [in the Ivy League].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time since 1994, the Harvard sailing team failed to finish in one of the all-important top eight spots at the New England Championships this past weekend.
The Crimson, which was ranked 15th in the nation coming into the regatta, finished 10th overall and failed to qualify for the ISCA Semifinals.
The top eight finishers at the event, which took place at Brown on Saturday and Sunday, will move on to the national semifinals that will take place on April 27 and 28 at Hampton University. From there, teams will qualify for the national championship regatta.
Facing tough weather conditions, Harvard searched for success by continuing to substitute boats for both the A and B divisions at the NEISC Dingy Championships.
Sophomore Michael Drumm and junior Isabel Ruane started in the A boat. After the first nine races, fellow sophomore Gram Slattery was substituted for Drumm in the boat. The team of Slattery and Ruane finished the next six races in the division A boat, which finished with 129 points.
The freshman duo of Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky raced the division B boat for the first four races, before sophomore Brian Drumm and freshman Jacob Bradt were substituted for races five through 10. Karnovsky and Mollerus then returned for the final five races, as the boat ended the competition with 159 points.
“We started off the regatta on somewhat of the wrong foot in the A division, but we tried to correct that going forward,” Bradt said. “In the B division, we started strong but started to struggle as we went along, which is why my boat was subbed in after the first couple of races. Then my boat started to struggle, so the first pair got subbed back in to help put a strong finish.”
The New England Conference is the toughest conference in the nation, as 10 teams in the conference are ranked in the top 20 overall nationwide.
“Overall we were just really inconsistent on the day,” Bradt said. “We would have a good race followed by bad races. A couple of factors contributed to our struggles: the teams we were facing were the best of the best, the conditions were really difficult to deal with, and we haven’t done much racing at Brown recently.”
While the biggest competition for the sailing team was the conference qualifiers at Brown, the Crimson competed at three other regattas this past weekend, racing at two coed regattas—the Oberg regatta at Boston University and the Central Series Regatta at Boston College—and at a women’s regatta hosted by the Coast Guard for the Women’s Emily Wick Trophy.
The Crimson finished 15th in the women’s regatta and seventh in the Oberg competition. The high finish of the weekend for Harvard came at the Central Series regatta, as the A and B division boats combined for a fourth-place finish.
“It was very cold Saturday with not a lot of wind, which is bad for racing,” said junior Ben Lamont, who was the A boat skipper at the Central Series. “On Sunday, the wind was a lot better for racing, and the conditions were just a big improvement.”
Sophomore Rebecca Frankel raced with Lamont in the A boat, and senior Nicholas Gordon raced with freshman Matt Clarida, who is also a Crimson news editor, in the B boat as Harvard finished with 182 points in the regatta.
In the competition for the Emily Wick Trophy, junior Caitlin Watson raced with freshman Kristina Jakobson for the first seven races and sophomore Emma Smith for the final eight in the A boat. In the B division, sophomore Ashleigh Inglis and freshman Sophie Bermudez raced for the Crimson, which finished with 320 points.
In the Oberg regatta, Harvard finished with 159 points as juniors Ames Lyman and Jacquelyn Cooley raced in the A division, while senior Jinyan Zang and sophomore Richard Bergsund competed in the B division.
Though most of the team saw some success in other regattas this weekend, Bradt focused in particular on the failure to qualify for the national semifinals.
“It is really hard to put a finger on one thing that went wrong,” Bradt said. “There were a lot of different things that added together. I think the overall theme of what went wrong is that we are a fairly young team. Not that our lack of experience is an excuse, per se, but our lack of race experience just compounded our mistakes this weekend against some really tough competition.”

Imagine trying to access Harvard University's homepage after a long night of debauchery, only to find yourself staring instead at the homepage of an Ivy League-themed porn site, accessed via harvard.xxx. Keep dreaming—that internet fantasy won't be happening anytime soon.Although some might delight in such a turn of events, Harvard seems to have felt that the prospect of a porn site named after our dear school would not be the best for the University's brand. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, in 2011—when .xxx was first added as an available suffix for domain names—Harvard forked over up to $300 to register harvard.xxx and prevent the address from being claimed by another party and made into a porn site. (Businessweek also suggests that other universities may have made similar financial investments to ensure their names weren't used on .xxx domains.)
Now, as part of the internet's first major expansion in almost a decade, more suffixes—including .fail and .sex—will be added to the list of available names with "the right of the dot."
So will Harvard get in on the new "dot" action? And what would a Harvard.fail even look like? The possibilities are endless.

I was never a prefrosh at Visitas, I never officially hosted a prefrosh, and I don't even know what the word Visitas means (is it Latin or a pun?). I did however, babysit my neighbor once, and I'm pretty sure that means I’m qualified to give advice on how to host prefrosh.
1. Take Your Prefrosh to Class
It's like Take Your Daughter to Work Day, except instead of your child, it's some kid you barely know, and instead of taking them to work, you just ditch class and make them take notes for you. Just make sure they have good handwriting and a decent foundational understanding of Swahili.
2. Placebo Your Prefrosh
Since they are coming to college, it is essential that prefrosh learn how to handle drinking. So give them all shots of water and tell them its Rubinoff. They'll think their BAC is higher than it really is, and more importantly, you'll save them from dehydration (and any unneccessary trips to UHS).
3. Pair Them Up
The best thing about Visitas is the friendships that are made. As a sophomore, I still hear students talk about the kids they met, spent the entire weekend with, and then never talked to again. Pretending to forget your Visitas friend is a tradition, so make sure to you, as a host, enforce the buddy system—especially when prefrosh cross the street and use the bathroom.
4. Make it Epic
When they return to the monotony of high school after Visitas, prefrosh will want to have stories to tell their friends. Help them out; give them an adventure. If all else fails, you can always lock them out of your room and then refuse to answer your phone.
