After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Industrial hues of grey, navy, and maroon greet viewers at the door of the Harvard Art Museums’ latest special exhibition, “Inventur–Art in Germany, 1943–55.” Named after a 1945 poem by Günter Eich, “Inventur” investigates a previously ignored movement in modern German art, an artistic journey from the immediate, post-war period to the early 1950s, and presents over 160 works by German artists in a detailed historical context.
“For these artists, the desire to continue working and to continue making—it finds its outlet in all different kinds of ways,” said curator Lynette Roth, gesturing at a wall of pieces by artist Franz Krause so bright in color and strange in composition they almost look more like images of microscopic organisms than art. According to Roth, the Head of the Division of Modern and Contemporary Art and Daimler Curator of the Busch-Reisinger Museum, this depiction was not coincidental. She detailed the various means by which artists were able to create during the war, even with limited materials and the intense censorship of unsanctioned artists by the Nazi Regime. Krause created his pieces with lacquer on wallboard. “Many of the artists worked in the industrial and commercial sphere and those were also areas where they were able to get their hands on different materials,” she added.
In keeping with its theme of bringing attention to forgotten and previously undisplayed art, “Inventur” seeks to showcase works from artists of varying backgrounds and experiences. “War experience not just as a modern artist, but as a woman, was important to me,” said Roth in reference to the exhibition’s first piece, Jeanne Mammen’s “Falling Facades (Berlin Ruins).” The painting depicts industrial structures in muted colors using air-raid protection cardboard as a canvas. While artists like Mammen created in secret or found refuge in other industries, others were drafted into the German military and continued to create using sketchbooks. One such artist, Juro Kubicêk, crafted the sketchbook “Mein K(r)ampf,” by collaging over a copy of Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” with both his own work and reproductions from anti-fascist German artists.
The exhibition is organized chronologically to show gradual changes in style that begins with the immediate aftermath of the war, transitions to more pluralist, avant-garde art of the late 1940s, and ends with stylistically commercial art representative of Germany’s economic recovery in the 1950s. Particularly haunting are a series of nine displayed drawings by artist Wilhelm Rudolph depicting the total destruction of the city of Dresden during the war. He roamed the ruined city streets, including his own, capturing the damage in over 200 drawings. “So much in this gallery is about that which is nearby,” said Roth, “So that really is a major theme of the exhibition, this kind of yearning, this sort of desire to find the private sphere again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much of the characterization of University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow’s selection to lead Harvard has focused on his similarities to his predecessor, University President Drew G. Faust. The comparison is apt: As Tufts’s president, Bacow emphasized global initiatives and attempted to bring together different schools, similar to Faust’s outreach and “One Harvard” campaigns. Additionally, Faust oversaw Bacow’s appointment to the Corporation, and praised his and others’ “intensity of commitment to higher education.”
Those who claim that Bacow’s leadership of higher education “echoes” that of his predecessor, however, overlook a key difference between the two. Faust’s path to the University’s top job—like that of University Presidents past—was defined primarily by her scholarship. A once and future historian and author of six books, Faust spent a quarter-century on the University of Pennsylvania’s faculty, where she received awards for teaching as well as chaired her department and a program in women’s studies. Her first exclusively administrative role was not until 2001, when Harvard hired her to lead the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, its smallest school-like unit; even then, she continued her scholarship as Lincoln Professor of History, a role she continues to hold.
By contrast, while Bacow’s background in academia is similarly prolific, his curriculum vitae demonstrates greater administrative experience than Faust’s did when she was picked to lead Harvard. In addition to his tenure on the Corporation and as president of Tufts—each an important role in higher education at the national level—Bacow served as chancellor of MIT, a director of Tufts Medical Center, and President-in-Residence of a program at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, to name a few positions.
While Bacow has no dearth of scholastic credentials himself, he enters his new role with a degree of separation from his days as a faculty member that Faust did not. Especially in this light, if Bacow aims to lead the University effectively, a main goal of his must be the development of a strong working relationship with the University’s faculty.
It would be unfortunately easy for Bacow not to prioritize this. Higher-profile issues, from the new tax on Harvard’s endowment to the University’s expansion into Allston, not to mention the transition into the presidency itself, may feel more urgent to Bacow. Nevertheless, he must not avoid the difficult, nuanced task of establishing and communicating his vision for his relationship with the scholars of the University.
In that vein, Bacow will have to define his position on the extents and limitations of faculty governance. His membership in the Corporation may not serve as an auspicious beginning for his relationship with some members of the faculty, given the recent finalization of penalties for members of single-gender social groups at the College by the Corporation. Some faculty members have resisted what they consider the University’s lack of faculty involvement on the issue. Regardless, no matter what position Bacow takes on faculty governance, he and the Faculty will only benefit from his communicating and justifying it effectively.
If Bacow does so urgently and does so well, he and the faculty have much to gain. For his part, Bacow will be best prepared to approach the aforementioned external challenges Harvard faces if the University itself is cohesive. The president of Harvard’s role as a spokesperson for higher education is derived from the strength of the University, which in turn stems from the academic accomplishments of the faculty themselves. The confidence of said faculty is therefore crucial if Bacow is to fairly and effectively represent Harvard.
In turn, the University’s faculty will benefit from teaching and researching at a university whose leadership is aware of its needs. Bacow will inevitably not see eye-to-eye with the majority of the faculty on every single issue, and nor should he, but he should be clear about the extent of his agreement and disagreement with them on important issues to enable them to adequately balance their roles in academia and University governance. Faust—perhaps due to her experience as a faculty member herself—has emphasized the importance of listening in her relationship with faculty, and Bacow would do well to follow her lead on this.
On the other hand, a toxic relationship with the University’s faculty can destroy a Harvard presidency (to use an extreme example). Bacow can, and should, not only avoid this but actively pursue a far more functional relationship. To do so, he must draw on both his administrative and academic experience to transparently communicate with faculty members about the roles he envisions them playing under his leadership. At this point, there is every reason to hope and expect that this will be the case.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, Lawrence S. Bacow was named Harvard’s 29th president. In that role, he will lead the nation’s oldest, wealthiest, and most prestigious university. He will add to his decades of service as an environmental policy researcher, a White House advisor, and a public policy expert.
But it is all too easy to forget that his story might never have begun.
His father, born in what is today Belarus, was brought by his family to America to flee anti-Semitic violence before the Holocaust. He was one of the lucky ones: At least sixty thousand Jews were killed in Eastern Europe between 1917 and 1921.
His mother came to the United States at age 19 after surviving Auschwitz, where about one million Jews were killed. She was the only member of her family and even her entire hometown to survive the Holocaust. Her story is a testament to survival but also to destruction. Indeed, of the roughly nine million Jews living in Europe before World War II, two out of every three were killed.
It could have been different. Many of those who faced death tried their hardest to come to America. My own great-grandmother managed to flee the same pogroms in Eastern Europe as Bacow’s father and eventually made it to Cuba where she waited for years before being finally granted entry to the U.S. Very few others succeeded in that path.
Countless others were killed as the U.S. and other countries closed their borders. In 1939, for instance, more than 900 Jews aboard the ship St. Louis set sail from Europe to the U.S. by way of Cuba, but they were refused entry. After sailing so close that they could see the lights of Miami, they were forced to return to Europe. Hundreds of them were killed in the Holocaust. Even Otto Frank, Anne Frank’s father, begged for help from an American friend, writing that the U.S. “is the only country we could go to.”
This was because of the Immigration Act of 1924, which limited entry to the U.S. by European Jews. It was a means of excluding from the U.S. those who most needed its help. In 1938 alone, for example, the American consulates in Europe received 125,000 visa applications, but the vast majority were rejected.
It is so disturbing, then, that just a few years ago, then-Senator and current Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the 1924 law as an example for the U.S. to follow today. He expressed concern at the number of immigrants in the U.S., only adding to the many anti-immigration statements made by President Donald Trump.
On their watch, the U.S. has more than halved the maximum number of refugees it will admit in a year. The Trump administration enforced a months-long severe restriction on refugees entering the U.S. early last fall. It has also fought for the deportation of immigrants facing persecution and violence in their home countries. These actions have real effects: With continuing violence in South Sudan, Afghanistan, Chad, Somalia, and Syria; massacres of minorities in Myanmar; and much more, the U.S. again faces the dilemma of helping those in desperate need of assistance, and we are again poised to neglect our responsibility.
Bacow today is a product of the very few European Jews lucky enough to have made it to America alive. Think of the untold contributions those others might have made to America. Think of the research that might have been done, the colleges that might have been led, the lives that might have been lived. And had just a few incidents been different, had a visa application been rejected or even the smallest decision gone another way, Bacow, or I, or most any American Jew might have been one of the members of that town whose name you will never know.
His story should serve as a grave reminder to all Americans: Turning our backs on refugees has immeasurable human costs. Doing so risks losing those who might go on to make untold contributions. Indeed, as University President, he will be serving the nation like few others. Harvard University counts among its graduates eight American presidents, at least 52 billionaires, and more than 150 Olympic athletes. Its contribution to the nation is unsurpassed.
During his press conference yesterday, Bacow said, “I would not be standing before you today, literally, if this country had turned its back on my parents.” Yet the U.S. might be turning its back now on the parents of a future Harvard president. It might be ending his or her story before it begins. Trump should be watching.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Traditionally, the point of asking questions has been to find out something you didn’t know before, and that’s why it’s so much fun that the Harvard Gazette joined the press conference announcing the selection of Lawrence S. Bacow as Harvard University’s 29th president.
The Gazette is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, and so possibly the most interesting part of the presser for me was hearing what questions the University had decided to plant. In these carefully choreographed events, the choice of questions seems to suggest something deeper about Harvard’s intentions and concerns.
This is no idle Kremlinology. The two questions posed by the Gazette—asking exactly how a searcher became the searched and how Harvard’s role in national politics may evolve—seem to offer a window into the minds of the search committee.
Up first was allaying and addressing the obvious concern that Bacow was not an expected choice, especially given that he was himself a Corporation member. It seems plausible that the search committee and Bacow worried that picking such a consummate Harvard insider might look insular or insufficiently imaginative. (Also notable: Shirley M. Tilghman, Corporation Fellow and member of the search committee, was chosen to be the president of Princeton in much the same way.)
The fact the 29th president was drawn from the Corporation itself—that the search committee picked one of their own—is symbolically representative of the continued ascendance of the University’s highest governing body as perhaps its only governing body. It’s easy to read this as another move towards centralization, especially when the press release took care to mention Bacow’s previous efforts to better knit together Tufts’s eight schools.
Whatever the concerns some faculty or deans may have about the pooling of power in Mass. Hall, it’s hard to construct a more qualified resume than leading the faculty at MIT, becoming president of Tufts, and serving for seven years on the Corporation. He knows both higher education as well as the particular problems, potential, and people of this place.
Quite apart from Bacow’s symbolic position in the institution, he may be the best person to lead Harvard forward. Yet if indeed the Corporation is an excellent training ground for the presidency, it seems likely this will not be the last such president-née-searcher.
By contrast, the second question seemed intended for a broader audience, perhaps one less concerned with Harvard org charts and more worried about liberal snowflakes. In what seemed to be a reflection of Harvard’s problems with the federal government and popular perception, the Gazette’s question—and much of Bacow’s broader message—surrounded the University’s reaction to the political climate.
We live in a political moment when both immigrants and Rust Belt workers feel shut out of the system, where Harvard seems politically under attack by a Republican White House and Congress, and where there’s been a resurfacing of the old charges that there’s something vaguely un-patriotic about what’s going on in college campuses.
These represent some of the biggest threats facing Harvard, its finances, and its people, so I am glad that Bacow has continued Faust’s emphasis on tackling those challenges head-on. For now, his only vehicle is rhetoric, and he begins by accepting some of the criticism, presumably conservative, as “fair.” What comes next is a veritable fusilade of reflections on contemporary threats to the American dream.
Both Bacow’s immigrant parents and his Michigan hometown, reeling from G.M. plant closures, are frequently referenced. Harvard, he said, must do more for “those in this country who’ve been left behind” by the decline of stable manufacturing jobs. The press release declares that Bacow has “long been devoted” to how higher education can allow “pursuit of the American dream.”
Indeed, the official video released by Harvard pairs three minutes of exposition about the uniqueness of Bacow’s American story with swelling music that would do Aaron Sorkin proud.
But perhaps the message is made clearest in the very last line of his response to the Gazette: “I see this as an opportunity to serve,” he says. “To serve an institution that’s made an enormous difference in my life and in so many other people’s lives but also as an opportunity to serve higher education and in the process, I hope, serve the nation.”
It’s all decidedly flag-wavy, and it tells an only-in-America story about Bacow that seems intended to cover Harvard and more broadly higher education in the blanket of patriotism. Bacow’s resume almost positions him as an elder statesman of higher education, and his frequent references to shepherding American universities through the dark years ahead have echoes of reasserting Harvard’s historical (though perhaps mostly self-imagined) primus inter pares status.
These are all positive signs, and I am glad that Harvard’s 29th leader is so well equipped to understand, prioritize, and tackle these challenges. Political and economic turbulence demand greater engagement from Harvard. They require a leadership with the instinct and ability to decisively act on behalf of the entire University. And a recognition of Harvard’s distinctively American history and character is not out of place.
Ironically, when a Crimson reporter asked Bacow at the press conference about his top priority, he declined to answer, suggesting it was premature. Yet on Sunday, his answer, and that of the search committee, was fully on display.

“Mistakes are proof that you are trying,” a poster reads. The thick, black letters stand out boldly against the cream wall. It is one of the most vivid decorations in the otherwise spartan office.
Kevin R. Sibley follows my gaze towards the motivational poster. “We really want our clients to have a different experience when they come in here,” he says. “We don’t want it to feel like a governmental building—we make it really comfortable so that they can relax, put their guard down, and plan for the future.”
Sibley, clad in a dark suit and baby blue tie, serves as Director of Boston’s Office of Returning Citizens. Established by Mayor Martin J. Walsh in late Oct. 2017, the Office of Returning Citizens works to reintegrate the 3,000 individuals who return to Boston each year from incarceration.
Sibley’s office stands a block south of the Harpoon Brewery in the Seaport District. “We’re in this location because it’s safe, away from the gang boundaries in the city,” Sibley explains nonchalantly. “For these gangs, territory is everything,” he continues. “So when we’re providing services, we have to keep in mind that a certain individual may not be able to cross into an area of the city for their own safety.”
Music plays from a speaker to his left. He dims the beat and ushers me to a seat. “[The office] works on four specific tenants: housing, healthcare, education, and employment,” Sibley explains.
Stable housing and gainful employment consistently rank among the most difficult challenges for the formerly incarcerated. The Boston Reentry Study, which was co-authored by Harvard Sociology Professor Bruce Western, followed 122 men and women leaving state prison in Massachusetts for communities in the Boston area. It found that six months after leaving prison, 35 percent of respondents were staying in temporary or marginal housing and only slightly more than half reported paid employment.
For the Office of Returning Citizens, addressing those challenges means building a comprehensive network of support for people transitioning out of the prison system. “Boston is blessed to have a great many resources,” Sibley explains. “However, they tend to operate in silos.”
In response, Sibley’s office cooperates with other nonprofits to consolidate the various services that they offer. “We receive people coming out of incarceration, and we help them to develop a plan based on our knowledge of and relationships with other organizations,” he says. Some of the agencies the Office of Returning Citizens works with include Boston Rescue Mission, Heading Home, the Initiative to End Chronic Homelessness, and the Boston Public Health Commission.
“Boston is built on a network of relationships,” he adds.
Having grown up in Dorchester, Sibley says he understands how to navigate those relationships. “It was a great experience,” he says, reclining in his chair and remembering years past. “Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other—and we were kids, we were young. We didn’t have to worry about some of the things that young people have to worry about today.”
Recalling the Dorchester of his youth, Sibley is transported back to his old stomping ground: the basketball court. “I grew up in a time where if your team lost a game, that might be it for the day for you, because everyone on the [sidelines] was like, ‘I got next, I got next’,” he explains, laughing. “We used to shovel snow out of the way to play ball.”
He pauses, and adds, “I don’t see that same energy anymore.” Dorchester is changing: last fall, a four property plot listed for an unprecedented 6 million dollars. “There are different faces in the area, for sure,” Sibley says. “Many use the term gentrification, but I look at affordability. Money has no culture, no creed, no race; it’s money—and sky high rents are causing people to migrate differently.”
He sighs. “Empty courts. Beautiful places, but empty places.”
It was amidst this changing backdrop that Sibley came to lead the Office of Returning Citizens. “I first started to look at social justice when I attended the Million Man March in 1995,” he says, referring to the historical gathering of about 850,000 African American men at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
“The tone and overall understanding of the march was to…” He stops to think. “As a black man, to look at your responsibility to the community, [to] accept your responsibility to the community—to help where you could and where your talents were.” Armed with this experience, Sibley has focused his energy on social work ever since.
I ask if he hopes the Office can play a role in restoring the community feel of Dorchester’s basketball courts, and Sibley’s smile returns. “That’s what I try to bring to this job, that engagement with others,” he explains. “As I say, pressing flesh, shaking hands, being in contact—those are key elements in helping someone feel that they’re important, important enough to remember.”
For the 3,000 citizens returning to Boston annually, that consideration may make all the difference. “Our role is to empower the individual to make their mark on the world, regardless of where they come from,” Sibley continues. “I believe that the Office of Returning Citizens is Mayor Walsh’s way of telling civic leaders, business owners, and community residents that everyone deserves a second chance, that everyone deserves to be treated as a human being.”
“We provide a pathway, any pathway we can, for those who are willing to work hard to move forward.” True to the poster on his wall, Sibley aims to facilitate his clients’ transition into a future that may liberate them from the shackles of their past.

The first two weeks of my summer abroad in Paris, I thought my host mom was obsessed with dingos.
Her name was Elisabeth and she was an interior designer (which translated, loftily, to architect des interieurs or “architect of the interiors”). She’d started hosting American students to feel less lonely after her husband passed away a few years prior. Mon mari qui est mort, she called him. “My-husband-who-is-dead,” all in one breath, as though that were his full name.
Elisabeth, aged 59, had the kind of chutzpah I admired most in women of her age: lived alone, traveled alone, managed her own business, and, in all manners of being, ran a tight ship. In her world, all matters held up to certain standards, and when they weren’t met, it was grounds for serious uproar. If the vendor at the marché sold her an unripe melon, this was absolument affreux! If the dust from the construction outside was swept under her door, covering her wood-floor entryway in a chalky layer of white, it became insupportable!
Of these expressions, dingue was the one she invoked most frequently. “C’était absolument dingue!” she laughed at dinner after I recounted the story of how my little brother bought a bulk-sized jar of protein powder from Costco in hopes of becoming “swole.” The word was used during la canicule, the heat wave that had imposed itself on the city in mid-July, turning the Métro into an underground hellfire and making a mockery of France’s nationwide resistance to air-conditioning units. It was also used during the attempted terrorist attack on the Champs-Elysées; that, too, was vraiment dingue, n’est-ce pas?
As with all French sounds, I tried desperately to grasp onto anything familiar. To me, “dingue” sounded unmistakably like “dingo.” As in, the wild orange dog. As in Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton’s complaint that “a dingo ate my baby.” I assumed it was one of those untranslatable words that has no exact English equivalent, or at least a word that didn’t appear in my high school French curriculum. To my frustration, the French-English dictionary in my brain came up blank.
I found it ironic when people wistfully sighed that French was “the most beautiful language.” To me, listening to a French sentence was like trying to wrestle a wild animal: an act of pure struggle. All attempts to pin this thing down were futile. It was a language that refused to be tamed, a language that slipped out of the mouths of waitresses and shop attendants in rapid-fire teeth and tongue, a series of sounds to which my brain struggled to assign meaning. This meant, then, that every interaction that punctuated my normal existence—the purchase of a latte, the payment of a restaurant bill, a timid, half-naked supplication from a department store dressing room for, um, the next size up, maybe? and in black?—became an insurmountable task, an Olympic feat. Before you could ask for anything, you’d have to conjugate at least three verbs and assign prepositions to their proper places, in order, and by that point, did you really mind drinking the wrong kind of coffee? Probably not.
This inevitably led to a series of humiliating malapropisms in conversations with Elisabeth. I once told her that it was “too much hot outside today.” Another time I told her I was pregnant, when I meant to say that I’d eaten enough. Elisabeth was gracious, explaining my mistakes, speaking slowly and over-enunciating, repeating words when I requested she do so. Still, the linguistic barrier hindered the natural rhythm of conversation.
Vladimir Nabokov wrote, “My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody’s concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English.” I wondered how much of my real personality could be distilled into clumsy French. The Caroline that Elisabeth knew looked like me—even sounded like me—but she wasn’t me. I felt like a different person in French. In English, I could be talkative and sarcastic; I could understand the nuances of irony and the rhythms of syntax. In French, I could hardly string together kindergarten-level thoughts.
As the summer went on, I learned to speak French more fluidly. But on the other hand, the natural hindrance that speaking French presented taught me that I had a natural instinct to speak too quickly and too often. In English, I tended to monopolize conversational space. Speaking French with Elisabeth taught me that the best way to participate in a conversation is sometimes as a listener. Over dinners of avocado salad and baguettes with hummus, she told me stories that ran the gamut from hilarious to outlandish to sad. She told me about how her son had married an anorexic redhead, Mathilde, who could bake a cake like nobody else. She told me how she’d fallen in love with her late husband and how she’d stolen him from another woman. After he died, she learned how to sail and spent the past five summers boating in Greece. Once, she climbed a sailboat mast to retrieve a lost scarf and found herself dangling 50 feet over the Adriatic, the red prize flapping in her hand.
Sometimes the best part was the negative space, the silence between words filled in by the traffic rushing under us.
Weeks later, I would eventually find the time to type dingue into the search bar of a French-English translator. It actually means “craziness” or “unbelievable” and not, as I had incorrectly presumed, an endangered Australian dog species.
After I left Paris, I wrote Elisabeth an email thanking her for letting me stay over the summer. It was mid-August, the middle of her vacation. I imagined her captaining a sailboat somewhere exotic, like the Aegean Sea or somewhere in the Mediterranean. I attached a few pictures of Harvard’s campus—the Yard and its changing trees—wishing she could see it in person. I wondered if I sounded more competent over email, when I had time to think before I articulated. I wondered if she’d correct my grammar.
In September, she replied. Profites-en. Je pense que ce sont vraiment d’excellentes tranches de vie!
“Enjoy yourself,” she’d written. “I think these are truly the excellent parts of life!”

UPDATED: February 11, 2018 at 12:37 a.m.
Harvard Corporation member Lawrence S. Bacow will serve as the University’s 29th president, members of the presidential search committee announced Sunday afternoon, ending a seven month-long search he initially helped conduct.
Bacow, 66, formerly served as the president of Tufts University and the chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has also held roles at the Kennedy School, the Graduate School of Education, the Law School—and, most recently, on Harvard’s own search committee.
Bacow will assume Harvard’s top post at a precarious time for higher education and the University. He will face a presidency and Congress in Washington D.C. that has proposed and enacted policies directly at odds with University’s goals, including a new tax on large university endowments that will likely cost Harvard tens of millions of dollars  per year.
Bacow must also grapple with a chronically underperforming endowment, oversee Harvard’s expansion into Allston, and finalize the roll-out of its controversial College policy penalizing membership in single-gender social groups.
Marking an unusual selection from within its own ranks, the committee approached Bacow to see if he would stop seeking the University’s next leader and interview for the job himself. He agreed to quit the committee in mid-December, months into a search that started over the summer.
Senior Fellow of the Corporation William F. Lee ’72 said that, as the committee solicited nominations, many within and outside of Harvard recommended Bacow for the job.
“He went through the same processes our other candidates but in the end he emerged as the person who we unanimously and enthusiastically believed was the best choice to lead Harvard forward. He is one of the most respectful, insightful, and experienced leaders in American higher education,” Lee said at the official press conference announcing Bacow’s selection Feb. 11.
“He knows universities like few others, and he knows Harvard.”
An economist and lawyer whose research focuses on environmental policy, Bacow led Tufts from 2001 to 2011. While at Tufts, he spearheaded that university’s largest-ever capital campaign to date, expanded financial aid and diversity initiatives, and created a new partnership with Tufts Medical Center.
He holds three Harvard degrees—a J.D from the Law School as well as an M.P.P. and Ph.D. from the Kennedy School of Government—and attended MIT as an undergraduate. He joined the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, in 2011.
Taking the podium at the press conference Sunday afternoon to address Harvard affiliates for the first time as the University’s president-elect, Bacow spoke about his lasting ties to the school.
“It was here I learned I was a teacher at heart. It was here I discovered that I wanted to devote my life to scholarship. It was here that nurtured my passion for higher education, and it was here that I discovered who I really was,” he said. “Now I’m grateful for the opportunity to give back to an institution that helped to make me the person that I am today.”

Bacow, a Michigan native, hails from a family of immigrants. His mother was an Auschwitz survivor and his father was a refugee from the pogroms of Eastern Europe. At Sunday’s press conference—his first public appearance as the president-elect—Bacow told his parents’ story and spoke about the impact of higher education on his own life.
“It was higher education that made this all possible, and I look forward to working every day as president of Harvard to ensure that future generations benefit from the same opportunity that my family had and so many of us, I suspect, who sit in this room today also have—and that is the opportunity to experience the American dream,” he said.
Bacow’s selection marks a return to white male leadership after Faust—Harvard’s first female president—broke the centuries-long pattern when she assumed the University’s top job in 2007. Alumni and students called on the search committee to consider a diverse slate of candidates during the search, urging the group to particularly prioritize candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.
Prior to stepping down from the committee, Bacow met with a group of Latino alumni and students to solicit their input on the search.
“I was in full listening mode,” Bacow said of that meeting as he exited Loeb House in Oct. 2017.
This is not the first time Bacow’s name has been floated for the Harvard presidency: He made the University’s shortlist of candidates for the 2006-2007 search that resulted in Faust’s selection, The Crimson reported in Dec. 2006. During that year’s search, Bacow repeatedly denied any interest in the Harvard post.
“I am very happy at Tufts and have no desire to leave. I took this job expecting it to be my last. I still do,” Bacow told the Tufts Daily in 2006.
Twelve years later, Lee, who chaired the search committee, praised Bacow’s leadership skills in a letter sent to Harvard affiliates Sunday announcing Bacow’s appointment.
“Larry Bacow is one of the most accomplished, admired, insightful, and effective leaders in American higher education,” Lee wrote.
Tufts President Anthony P. Monaco, who succeeded Bacow at the university, also lauded Bacow in an email to The Crimson earlier in the fall.
“Larry is a national leader in higher education, and has a deep understanding of both the challenges and opportunities that universities face today,” Monaco wrote.
Harvard’s presidential search has been underway since University President Drew G. Faust announced over the summer she planned to step down in June 2018 after 11 years at the helm. The search committee—originally comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—spent the ensuing months whittling down a list of more than 700 candidates to just one.
The process was long and secretive. Search committee members convened 16 times, meeting behind the closed doors of Loeb House and in at least one searcher’s home in residential Belmont, Mass. in an effort to keep the identities of candidates under wraps.
The search remained in “information-gathering mode” for the first few months as faculty, staff, and student advisory committees helped the committee gather input from thousands of Harvard affiliates worldwide. The search committee had begun narrowing its list by October. The Crimson reported in Dec. 2017 that the committee had winnowed its slate of finalists to under 20 names.
Though Lee and other members of the search committee repeatedly declined to discuss the search or disclose the identities of other candidates, faculty and alumni consistently named Business School Dean Nitin Nohria, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Government Professor Danielle S. Allen as probable internal candidates.
Ultimately, though, the committee chose one of its own.
“I am humbled and honored by the opportunity to lead this remarkable institution – and to succeed Drew Faust, whom I have been privileged to count as a friend and an inspiration since we met over a decade ago,” Bacow wrote in a press release Saturday.
Bacow will formally begin his duties as University president on July 1, 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten years ago, Lawrence S. Bacow was on the shortlist of candidates for the 28th President of Harvard University. This time around, he’ll be making the shortlist in another way—as a member of the Harvard Corporation, which is leading the search for the 29th.
As former president of Tufts University—just north of Harvard—and a former chancellor at MIT, Bacow brings deep expertise in higher education to the presidential search committee.
“Larry is a national leader in higher education, and has a deep understanding of both the challenges and opportunities that universities face today,” Anthony P. Monaco, Bacow’s successor at Tufts, wrote in an email.
In some ways, Bacow’s time in academic administration echoes that of Harvard’s current University President Drew G. Faust: Both steered their institutions through the 2008 financial crisis, sought to consolidate the central governance at their respective universities, and fulfilled the role of fundraiser-in-chief.
Bacow’s speeches as an academic leader also hint at priorities in line with Faust’s—suggesting he may be looking for a leader ready to continue her agenda. At the time of his Tufts presidential inauguration in 2002, Bacow set out three major priorities for the university: moving towards an education that stresses global thinking, “teaching collaboration as a way of life,” and centralizing governance structures across Tufts’ eight schools.
“How do we educate leaders for a truly global world? By teaching collaboration as a way of life—and a source of answers,” Bacow said in 2002. “By bringing together research and education in ways that could not be accomplished anywhere else."
Faust, too, has operated under a “One Harvard” philosophy that seeks to tie together the University’s long-independent schools. And in her decade-long tenure, Faust has pushed forward Harvard’s global initiatives, opening new international research centers and overseeing the creation of the continent-spanning Global Advisory Council.
Bacow’s close proximity to undergraduate life at Tufts also suggests he may prioritize candidates who hail from the higher education sphere and show a commitment to his ideals of university education.
“We need to be attentive to the entire realm of the undergraduate experience," Bacow said at his inauguration. “Today, colleges and universities everywhere are rushing to define themselves as ‘student-centered.’ At Tufts, we can say with confidence and pride that we already are.”
During his tenure, Bacow regularly dealt with issues of undergraduate social life. One Tufts tradition in particular, the Naked Quad Run—which draws inebriated undergraduates to campus thoroughfares en masse—prompted two separate campus-wide memos from his office. When it became clear that the tradition posed a serious safety concern to students, he moved to abolish it altogether.
While Harvard’s similar Primal Scream tradition has continued largely unchallenged, the next University president will also likely have to grapple with undergraduate social life. Before she leaves, Faust will hand down a decision on the fate of Harvard’s single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, which she may choose to penalize or ban altogether. William F. Lee ’72, the Corporation’s senior fellow, has said the next president will likely stick with Faust’s decision.
In any case, though, search committee members will likely look to Bacow’s years of experience leading a large Massachusetts university as they narrow down the pool for Harvard’s next president.
“His expertise and knowledge will be a great asset to the search committee,” Monaco wrote.

Alumni and students gathered Saturday afternoon at the Office of Career Services for a roundtable discussion on sexual harassment in the workplace hosted by the Harvard Alumni for Global Women’s Empowerment.
Attendees shared experiences, opinions, and insights on sexual misconduct in the workplace, and strategized on how to combat it.
Global WE is a shared interest group of the Harvard Alumni Association, with members in several countries. Discussion facilitator, Julie G. Palmer ’84 said the roundtable sought to further Global WE’s mission: to empower women through education, dialogue, and connection among individuals working for women’s rights and freedoms worldwide.
Both Palmer and Rebecca C. Ribaudo ’93, who co-facilitated the discussion, said they wanted to emphasize that not only women are victims of sexual harassment .
During the event, discussion topics included corporate cultures and environments, the influence of the #MeToo anti-sexual assault movement on culture and opportunity, and how and when sexual misconduct occurs. The conversation also touched upon taking action, ranging from being a good bystander to holding corporate Human Resource departments accountable.
Sajida H. Shroff, vice president of Global WE, focused on differences in how society treats girls and boys. Shroff said girls are usually told to aspire to be “good girls” and that doing so will give them the most rewards in life.
“You were taught to live by the rules, which is not a bad thing. But the world has changed. The world has changed a lot,” Shroff said. “I don’t think we were taught to change with the world”
Shroff said she now encourages girls to “be bad.”
“Be strong, be yourself, be assertive. By being bad, I mean take responsibility for yourself and for your actions. Live up to your potential, and do what you need to do, as long as you’re not hurting other people,” Shroff said.
While Global WE predominantly operates as an alumni organization, Gabriella D. Kaplan ’18, who serves as College co-liaison for the group, shared excitement about her plans to start a Global WE chapter starting at the College this fall.
“We are hoping to begin an on-campus Global WE chapter next year,” Kaplan said. “We are really excited because we have a cohort who are really on board.”
Event moderators said the discussion was a safe and supportive space.
“We often let ourselves be disempowered, but the beauty of Global WE is that we raise awareness around different issues to inspire change on a personal level and, over time, hopefully, on a societal level,” Shroff said. “If you talk, something will happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Activist and author Robert “Bob” K. Massie visited The Democracy Center on Friday to discuss his campaign for the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 this November.
Massie was hosted by “Harvard Students for Massiechusetts”, a student group led by Ted G. Waechter ’18, a Crimson editorial writer. Throughout the conversation, Massie criticized the Baker administration.
Massie, a graduate of Harvard Business School, is one of three confirmed candidates in the Democratic primary. Jay Gonzalez, the former Secretary of Administration and Finance for Mass. under Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, and Setti Warren, former Mayor of Newton, are also running.
In his speech, Massie—a self proclaimed “lifelong progressive”—discussed his focus on reducing economic inequality and placed particular emphasis on improving the Mass. public transit system and removing barriers to upward mobility.
“Our budget is broken; we’re coasting along. We are not making investments. But most important we are not showing the rest of the country and the rest of the world what real progress looks like. Progress that is a combination of technological brilliance, smart financing, but most important—justice,” Massie said.
Massie said the relationship between President Donald Trump and Baker, both Republicans, is a major concern.
“I think people are tired of Baker playing footsie with Donald Trump,” Massie said. “I worry that the country is really drifting in a dangerous direction and that we do not have the leadership in this state to fight back.”
Despite low approval ratings for Trump statewide, a majority of Mass. voters approve of Baker’s performance, according to a WBUR poll. Massie discussed Baker’s high approval ratings and the challenge of running against an incumbent.
“The governor wants to encourage this idea that he's unbeatable but that's a mistake, anybody can be beaten,” he said.
Massie ended the evening by taking questions from students and inviting them to visit his campaign headquarters. He urged them to remember their values and be passionate about them.
“Life is constrained, liberty is constrained and there’s just not a lot of room for the pursuit of happiness,” Massie said.

UPDATED: February 15, 2018 at 4:48 p.m.
The Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion and the Office of BGLTQ Student Life have begun moving into their new joint office space in the basement of Harvard Yard’s Grays Hall after nearly a year of renovations.
Construction began in the spring of 2017 and the basement project was officially completed at the end of the fall semester, though both offices are still unpacking boxes, according to Director of Diversity Education and Support Robin M. Johnson.
The space sports a kitchen, three all-gender bathrooms, a no-shoes “serenity room,” a library, a seminar room, and offices for staff and student interns, all connected by a walkway referred to as the “activity thread.”
“[The architects] were very intentional about creating this activity thread where students can sit and study or just hang out in general. There are outlets everywhere so that they can plug in their materials,” Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, director of the BGLTQ office, said.
Though the offices are located in the basement of Grays Hall, the new space does not have a “basement feel,” Scarborough said. The architects incorporated student requests for open areas after feedback from a town hall meeting held last fall by both offices in anticipation of the move.
“Part of their plan was to excavate a lot of the dirt that was in front of the space and make this gradual incline, both that would be accessible for students in wheelchairs, but that would also feel inviting and not like you’re descending into a ‘dark space,’” Scarborough said. “It's fully accessible, which is also a reflection of our offices’ mission. We need to be and we are.”
Students working for the offices said they appreciate the new location in the Yard.
“It very much feels like we have an accessible place for people to come,” Diversity Peer Educator Sunah S. Chang ’20 said. “I think it’s good to have a centralized location on campus that students can associate with our work and our events.”
Ming Li Wu ’21, a programming intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said they noticed a significant increase in visitors following the move into the Yard.
“We have a lot more student traffic,” Wu said.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life, founded in 2012, was first opened in the basement of Boylston Hall. The office temporarily moved to 7 Linden St. in 2016, sharing the space with the Office for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and the Bureau of Study Counsel while awaiting the completion of the new space in Grays.
“Because we were just sort of in a temporary space in the Bureau of Study Counsel, we haven’t been able to take ownership of the space even though we really enjoyed being there and having the BSC as our neighbors,” said Patric C. W. Verrone ’18, a communications intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life. “Now that we have a space that is really ours and that we’re able to coordinate with EDI, we can really sort of imbue it with our own philosophy.”
Although the new space is already in use—student interns at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life  held a study break in the library on Feb. 7—the offices plan to host official opening celebrations in the coming weeks.
“We're looking forward to planning an opening event for staff in the community as well as students. There is still some settling in to do, but we're moving pretty swiftly to do that,” Johnson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 14, 2018 at 4:52 p.m.
Undergraduate South Asian student organizations gathered to discuss the #MeToo movement, sexual harassment, and entertainment on Thursday evening in the wake of a recent viral article that accused comedian Aziz Ansari of sexual misconduct.
The discussion, co-sponsored by the South Asian Association, South Asian Women’s Collective, and South Asian Men’s Collective, focused on the racial and power balance implications of the allegations against Ansari, published on website Babe.net.
“When the Babe article broke, I was in conversation about it with a lot of my South Asian friends, both male and female, across the Harvard community,”  said Simi N. Shah ’19, co-president of the South Asian Association. “And a lot of them, when we got back to campus, were saying, ‘You know, I keep having these conversations with people, and I think it would be nice if SAA would do some sort of round table discussion.’”
Members of the groups said they viewed the discussion, in part, as an opportunity to discuss race as it relates to the #MeToo movement.
“Oftentimes, race is left out of the discussion when we discuss sexual harassment and sexual assault,” Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said. “So we felt that it was really important for us to have this conversation and discuss it with an intersectional lens.”
Aditi T. Sundaram ’19, co-president of the South Asian Women’s Collective, said the three organizations had previously united for health-related issues affecting the South Asian community, but that this type of formal community discussion was new.
“This would be a first step in terms of talking about social issues and political issues,” Sundaram said. “The fact that we covered a lot of ground in an hour was really encouraging. It meant that this was something that was on people’s minds.”
The student leaders of the organizations said they were grateful for the strong support shown by the students who attended.
“I think every one of us needs to continue these conversations outside of forums like this,” said Ida M. Paul ’20, a student who attended the event.
This event was the first in a series of discussions hosted by the South Asian Association this semester, and many students said they hope to continue the conversation. Palaniappan and Shah confirmed that plans for a follow-up discussion are in the works for the coming months, along with other political events.
“There’s always so much more that’s left to be talked about. I don’t even think we started to scratch the surface, and there’s no way you could in an hour on a topic that requires so much attention and conversation and constant dialogue,” Shah said.
Leaders of the groups said they hoped other groups on campus would consider holding similar conversations.
“It shouldn’t take an incident like this Aziz Ansari case to start this conversation. That shouldn’t be the catalyst,” said Aashay A. Sanghvi ’19, president of the South Asian Men’s Collective. “I think that more groups should come together and do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday to collect feedback on its recent menstrual hygiene pilot program in order to convince College administrators to fully fund the distribution of hygiene products to all students.
The UC-funded pilot, which debuted last spring for freshmen and expanded to all undergraduates in the fall, provided free menstrual products to students in dorms and Houses. According to Eliot House representative Arnav Agrawal ’20, the pilot program was only intended to be a temporary measure to demonstrate the need for widespread availability of these products on campus.
“The ultimate aim of the pilot programs was not for the UC to do such pilot programs but actually act as a catalyst for institutionalization,” Agrawal said.
Agrawal argued the Council should not have been tasked with organizing and financing the pilot in the first place, calling on administrators to treat hygiene products like any other service they provide to students.
“Typically, we shouldn’t even be doing this,” Agrawal said. “I didn’t see the administration conduct a pilot program or a feedback form when they provided everyone with free toilet paper.”
“This is a basic utility that I think people should have,” he added.
The UC aims to provide administrators with feedback in time for the products to be made available to all students by this upcoming fall, according to the legislation.
Also during the meeting, Finance Committee members announced that the committee was overwhelmed with funding requests this week and was forced to make unusually high across-the-board cuts to its grants. The committee had allocated $25,500 for the week, but received $34,000 in requests, according to Finance Committee Chair Henry S. Atkins ’20.
Making matters worse, Atkins said the budget shortfall looked as if it would not be a one-time occurrence, noting that the committee has already received almost $34,000 in requests for next week as well.
Ivy Yard Representative Seth D. Billiau ’21, who serves as Vice Chair of Data of the Finance Committee, said after the meeting that although funding requests have increased, he wouldn’t characterize the situation as “dire.”
Billiau said the committee may be able to make use of unused money allocated last semester.
“If everything holds like it is has in the past, we will get that money back,” Billiau said. “But we can’t budget for it, you know, right now.”
Despite these assurances, Billiau wouldn’t rule out tapping into the Council’s emergency fund, a $20,000 pool of money set aside for pressing budget shortfalls.
“It’s something we’re considering,” he said.

Lawrence S. Bacow will become the 29th president of the country’s oldest university at a time when higher education is under siege.
Republican lawmakers are taxing large university endowments, threatening cuts to federal research funding, and debating the future of undocumented students and financial aid, among other issues. In an interview in November, outgoing University President Drew G. Faust called the endowment tax “a blow at the strength of American higher education,” expressing dismay at the turning tide in Washington against universities.
As Harvard’s next president, Bacow will wade into this hostile political climate—and he bluntly acknowledged the industry’s skeptics in his first public appearance as president-elect.
“These days, higher education has plenty of critics. And candidly, I think some of the criticism is fair,” Bacow said at the press conference Sunday afternoon announcing his appointment.
The Harvard presidency has long required its holders to use the office as a platform to advocate for higher education writ large. Since the election of President Donald Trump in Nov. 2016, this task has become an increasingly pressing imperative.
In their speeches Sunday, Bacow and William F. Lee ’72—the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and the head of the presidential search committee—both made reference to public and political disillusionment with higher education.
Taking the podium to announce Bacow’s selection, Lee said the search committee sought “someone who also clearly sees and is ready to confront the great challenges facing us at a moment when the value of higher education is being questioned and a moment when the fundamental true of fact based inquiry is being questioned and called into doubt.”
“We wanted someone who could hit the ground running because neither we, nor higher education, have time to spare,” Lee added.
Bacow is not new to the higher education scene—he served as the president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011 after working as the chancellor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And he isn’t new to Harvard, either: he holds an M.P.P and Ph.D. in public policy from the Kennedy School, as well as a J.D. from the Law School. He returned to Harvard decades after graduating to serve on the Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—and in various capacities at the Kennedy School, Graduate School of Education, and the Law School.
“I must confess that when I arrived at the Kennedy School in 1972 as a 20 year old graduate student, I never could have imagined that I would be standing here today,” Bacow said Sunday.
Despite his enthusiasm for a school where he spent many of his formative years, Bacow conceded that some of Harvard’s—and higher education’s—institutional patterns need to change.
“We need to do a better job of controlling our costs, we need to do a better job of operating more efficiently,” he said. “We need to collaborate with others, with peer institutions, with industry. And we need to be vigilant to ensure that our campuses are always open to new ideas, that they are places where our members feel free to express themselves, and also where every member of this community feels he or she belongs.”
In an interview, Corporation and search committee member Shirley M. Tilghman said Harvard presidents are expected to champion “important public policy issues” facing higher education—for example, arguing for the “value” of a liberal arts education and the importance of federal research funding.
Bacow shied away from mentioning any specific plans to lobby lawmakers in D.C. but he did express a commitment to advocating on behalf of undocumented students at the University, as Faust has done throughout her presidency. Approximately 65 undocumented students currently attend the College. Faust has spoken out forcefully against the repeal of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program allowing undocumented youth to live and work legally in the United States.
“I think we have to do everything we can to support those students who are here who have known no other country, who are talented, I think Drew has demonstrated extraordinary leadership and I look forward to also being a strong voice on behalf of them,” Bacow said.
Beyond national issues, Bacow will confront a number of challenges closer to home—namely, those stemming from what administrators call Harvard’s efforts to become a more inclusive and welcoming campus.
Central to the controversy over inclusion and belonging at Harvard is the May 2016 policy placing penalties on members of single-gender social organizations. During the question-and-answer period of the press conference Sunday, Bacow repeatedly used the pronoun “we” when discussing the rationale behind the penalties, referring to his role on the governing body that ultimately decided to preserve the policy in Dec. 2017 after more than a year of debate.
Bacow reaffirmed his commitment to the controversial policy, calling the rule the “right one for Harvard.”
“Part of what we’re trying to do is ensure that every student who comes to Harvard has an experience which is welcoming, and has an experience which makes them feel like a part of this community,” Bacow said. “President Faust and her team have put together a policy which we’ve had a chance to spend some time thinking about and will have more time to think about going forward.”
He acknowledged he was a member of a fraternity as an undergraduate at MIT. But Bacow said he thinks “those were very different times.”
“When I was enrolled at MIT, there were about 1000 students in my class and I think less than about five percent were women, so there was no such thing as gender-neutral housing at MIT,” he said. “Fortunately, MIT has changed and Harvard’s changed.”
At the press conference, Bacow also addressed long-standing calls from alumni and students arguing a candidate from an underrepresented background should be selected for the University presidency. Bacow defended his own record promoting diversity at other institutions.
“During my time at both Tufts and at MIT, I worked very, very hard to promote excellence, and I think diversity is a pathway to excellence,” he said. “We need to look for the very best, and during my time at Tufts I’m proud of the record of bringing women and minorities and people of color into the senior leadership, into the faculty, and also into the student body, and I hope to do the same thing here.”
Tilghman said the Corporation considered calls for diversity in its charge to find the “very best” person to lead the University for the next decade.
“In order to execute that charge appropriately we looked very broadly and inclusively at candidates,” she said. “I feel as though we took very seriously our charge but we did it in a very broad way.”
In recent decades, Harvard has placed large bets on becoming an engineering powerhouse in the 21st century.
Two University presidents have made expanding into Allston a priority and Faust announced in 2013 that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would make the move across the river. The new campus is slated for completion in 2020.
Bacow, an economist and lawyer who specializes in environmental policy, will oversee the completion of this move—and with it, a continued expansion of Harvard’s science offerings.
“Allston gives us a chance to forge new partnerships, both intellectually and others, between Harvard and our neighbors, between Harvard and our sister institutions, between Harvard and the rest of the world,” he said.
Tilghman said Allston will be one of the “most important” focuses for Bacow when he takes office.
“It’s a once-in-a-century opportunity for Harvard to expand in a way that will be beneficial not just to the institution but to Boston and to Massachusetts and ultimately the whole country,” Tilghman said. “It was clear that was going to be an initiative that had to be continued.”
Growth in the sciences formed a critical consideration throughout the search, according to Tilghman. The committee met with Francis J. Doyle III, the dean of SEAS, multiple times in the early stages of the search.
Bacow’s speech seemed to prove him similarly committed to advancing Harvard’s standing in the sciences. He called Allston an opportunity to “envision the university of the future.”
“Our breadth has long been our great strength, and our great opportunity now is the chance to combine our strengths in new ways that help address some of the world's most pressing problems,” he said.
In response to a question raising concerns that Harvard’s science programs pale in comparison to those of its competitors, Bacow said he thinks “the sciences at Harvard are second to none.” He particularly praised Faust’s initiatives on this front.
Bacow said he thinks his love of science and his experience working with scientists at both MIT and Tufts will help him carry on Faust’s legacy.
“I’m not a scientist myself but I’m a science junkie, it’s the reason I went to MIT as an undergraduate,” he said. “I’ve worked closely in my prior life with scientists, with engineers, mathematicians, and physicians, and I look forward to doing it here as well.”
Throughout the search, nonetheless, Lee maintained the significance of soft skills in the search committee’s consideration.
In a Nov. 2017 interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-owned publication, he said he wants a president with “fundamental human characteristics.” At the press conference, Lee focused heavily on Bacow’s commitment to leadership and to the University.
“He inspires trust. He is not just smart, but wise. He is innovative and entrepreneurial. He has high academic standards and excellent judgment in people,” Lee said. “He is a person whose natural instinct is to give credit but not take it, and as a result he is all about the institution and the people in the institution, and not about himself. He is someone who loves Harvard but whose love isn’t blind.”
In an interview after the press conference, Bacow said he plans to spend the next few months before he official takes on the role in “sponge mode.”
“I’m going to be trying to learn as much as I can so that when July 1st comes around I’ll be in a position to be able to assume the responsibility and carry the ball from her and it will be a smooth handoff,” Bacow said.
In the meantime, he said he is most excited to learn about the parts of Harvard with which he is less familiar.
“I’ve spent my entire professional career on a college campus and I consider myself blessed to have been able to do that,” he said. “I’m looking forward to going back to school.”

Harvard’s soon-to-be 29th president strolled into Loeb House the morning of his confirmation unnoticed and under the radar.
Past presidential candidates snuck through garages or up back-service stairways to avoid media attention as they met secretly with the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, to seek the group’s majority vote required to confirm their appointment. But not number 29.
He walked right up to Loeb House’s white door on a rainy Sunday at 9:58 a.m., passing two Crimson reporters waiting outside, without once seeking to conceal his identity or hide his face. He did not even dip his umbrella.
He did not have to—anyone watching would have expected him to be there anyway.
After eight long months and more than 700 nominations, the search committee had settled on one of its own: Harvard Corporation and former search committee member Lawrence S. Bacow.
Bacow—whose name escaped press speculation throughout the search—exited Loeb a few hours later as the University’s president-elect. The Overseers’ vote to confirm a leader from within the selection committee itself is without precedent in recent Harvard history.
Corporation and search committee member Shirley M. Tilghman said Bacow traded the title of searcher for candidate in December; the committee began interviewing Bacow, along with other presidential possibles, a month later in January. Bacow chose to step down after other searchers asked him if he was willing to be considered and he said yes, Tilghman said.
“We then integrated him into the interview process as we would any other candidate,” she said. “He was not treated differently at all.”
In many ways, the committee’s search this year was not too different from past presidential searches, either. Like search committees of yore, the 2017 iteration solicited input from a wide range of Harvard affiliates and alumni; criss-crossed the country to garner advice from prominent players in higher education; and sought to keep the process totally confidential, meeting in out-of-the-way places like residential Belmont, Mass. and repeatedly declining to comment on the search.
But ultimately—unlike in past years—the committee’s final pick was always hiding in plain sight.
William F. Lee ’72, the senior fellow of the Corporation and the chair of Harvard’s presidential search committee, was taking a car home from the airport when he had a thought: “What about Larry?”
The idea had been germinating for a while. Lee said during a press conference Sunday—after officially naming Bacow the University’s 29th president—that individuals interviewed by the search committee suggested Bacow early in the process. The committee spent the first few months of the search in “information-gathering” mode, talking to hundreds of Harvard affiliates and reviewing presidential nominations.
At first, Bacow himself dismissed the idea as ridiculous, the president-elect said during the Sunday press conference.
“Some of [the interviewees] said, ‘What about you, Larry?’ and I said, ‘No, thank you,’” Bacow said. “I was there to get their ideas about others to lead Harvard.”
“And then there came a point in which Bill Lee, the senior fellow, turned to me and—maybe you should describe what happened next, Bill,” Bacow said Sunday, addressing Lee.
Lee pointed to that car ride home from the airport. By that time, several Harvard faculty members had contacted him “directly” to propose Bacow. Lee said his musings in the vehicle eventually led him to realize it would be “irresponsible” not to at least ask Bacow if he was interested.
“So I called him and said, ‘What about you?’” Lee said. “And we had a good discussion and he decided to think about it.”
“At least from my perspective, that was the moment,” Lee said.
Lee did not specify when this moment occurred, but it may have come soon before Bacow’s December decision to step down from the committee. At that point, the searchers had been hunting for the successor to University President Drew G. Faust for roughly five months.
The committee—comprising all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three Overseers—formed three weeks after Faust’s June 2017 announcement that she plans to step down in summer 2018.
In December, The Crimson reported the searchers had narrowed their pool of finalists to under 20 names. In the weeks that followed, the committee whittled that list even further, holding clandestine meetings to grill potential presidents for hours behind closed doors.
The searchers gathered in committee member Tracy P. Palandjian’s Belmont, Mass. residence on Jan. 13 and spent almost the entire day in private deliberations. During that meeting, at least two chauffeured cars with tinted windows—perhaps bearing candidates—passed in and out of Palandjian’s long, concrete drive. The committee likely met with candidates during at least two other weekends in January, holding the interviews in both Boston and New York City, according to documents obtained by The Crimson.
By late January, though, the searchers knew what they wanted. Tilghman said Sunday the search committee was certain Bacow was “the right candidate” for at least two weeks before the Feb. 11 announcement.
Bacow—having checked with his wife, Adele—was on board. All that remained was to tell the Overseers.
Hailing from around the world, they descended on Cambridge the weekend of Feb. 10: nearly all of the 30 members of the Board of Overseers, the Harvard Corporation, and some members of the Harvard Alumni Association. Almost no one knew ahead of time the weekend would culminate in the selection of the University’s 29th president.
Those who did know—and even those who didn’t—largely kept their mouths shut. Members of the three bodies held at least two meetings in Loeb House over the course of the weekend: one Saturday evening and one Sunday morning.
In the waning hours before the announcement, Overseers as well as Corporation and HAA members—treading the brick paths that bisect the green lawn in front of Loeb and skirting Crimson reporters—almost all refused to comment.
At 6 p.m. Saturday, several members of all three groups arrived at the front door of Loeb for a reception and dinner. Attendees said Overseers normally gather for a meal the night before official meetings.
John P. Reardon, Jr. ’60, former executive director of the HAA, arrived at the dinner sporting a Harvard Crimson basketball hat and wielding a bluish-black umbrella. Asked what he was doing at Loeb House, Reardon commented on the weather instead.
“It’s about to rain,” he told Crimson reporters standing outside. “I hope you have an umbrella.”
Faust walked into Loeb House just before 5 p.m. Saturday. In response to questions about the presidential search, she said the Saturday afternoon gathering was a “general meeting.”
Minutes later, search committee member Palandjian also walked in. Asked what the meeting was about, she replied, “I can’t talk.”
A female Overseer—who arrived after 7 p.m. wearing a backwards baseball cap and who declined to give her name—hurried past reporters. She said she was late to dinner, adding the Saturday Overseer gathering would comprise discussion of the “usual things.”
When Faust left Loeb a few hours later, she refused to answer questions but told Crimson reporters standing outside that her dinner was “great.”
“You know what was greater?” she asked. “Harvard beat Penn.”
The Harvard men’s basketball team toppled previously undefeated Penn Friday, 76-67.
The next morning, Overseers began trickling into Loeb around 9 a.m. Members of the Corporation joined the Overseers roughly an hour later, many of them trekking on foot from the nearby Charles Hotel.
Not Corporation member and searcher David M. Rubenstein, though. Rubenstein—spotted wearing a black-and-grey sweatsuit and walking through the lobby of the Charles earlier in the morning—rode in a chauffeured black Cadillac from the hotel to Loeb a few minutes after 10 a.m.
On arriving at Loeb roughly a quarter of an hour later, Rubenstein declined to say what he was doing there.
“I don't know, I'm lost at the moment,” he said.
Rubenstein’s fellow Corporation member and searcher Paul  J. Finnegan took a slightly different tactic to evade reporters.
Approached walking into Loeb House, Finnegan did not answer questions but noted he’d been following the Winter Olympics. He pointed out that a Harvard hockey player is currently competing for Team U.S.A.
“You should really check it out,” Finnegan said. “It’s a cool story.”
At 3:15 p.m. on Feb. 11, the months of silence broke.
Lee took the stage in Harvard’s Barker Center to officially and finally name Faust’s successor.
“I have the great honor and privilege of introducing you in a few moments to the 29th president of Harvard University, Larry Bacow,” Lee said.
Bacow, smiling and wearing a Harvard tie, approached the podium, shook Lee’s hand, and thanked the clapping crowd.
“Those of us privileged enough to lead this university are invested with a precious trust,” Bacow said. “I promise to do everything within my power to prove myself worthy of that trust. Thank you very much.”
Moments after stepping down from the stage, Bacow gathered his family—his wife and his two sons—for their first-ever photo as Harvard’s next first family.
Later, leaving the press conference, several search committee members—finally willing to speak—praised Bacow’s qualifications and said they were excited to see him assume Harvard’s top job.
“I’m absolutely thrilled,” search committee and Corporation member Susan L. Graham ’64 said.
“I second that,” fellow searcher and Corporation member Jessica Tuchman Mathews ’67 said. “I think the reaction among the Overseers, and staff, and everybody was heard today and confirms our feeling that this was an extraordinary opportunity.”
Fighting his way through a sea of Burberry trench coats after the press conference, former University President Neil L. Rudenstine said he believes Bacow is “fantastic” and “exactly right.”
Searcher and member of the Corporation Kenneth I. Chenault added he thinks Bacow will be able to approach the top job from a worldly perspective, allowing him to connect well with those beyond the University’s gates.
“I think he’s going to do an unbelievable job because he understands both the needs of Harvard, but also the needs of higher education,” Chenault said. “I think he will speak to the world in a very powerful way.”
Near the close of the day Feb. 11, though, Bacow hardly wanted to speak at all. Approached by Crimson reporters as he exited Loeb House around 6 p.m., Bacow said he is excited to lead the University but felt almost too worn out to stand.
“I’m tired,” he said. “I need to get off my feet.”

When Kirkland House administrator Kate D. Cavell was an undergraduate at Tufts University, she spoke to freshmen on the first night of pre-orientation. Later that night, to her surprise, she received an email from then-Tufts President Lawrence S. Bacow.
“He was in the audience, and he sent me an email thanking me,” Cavell said. “It meant so much to me as a student to get the acknowledgement of the President. That was a really special feeling.”
Now Bacow—a long-time academic administrator—will once again have the opportunity to interact with Boston-area undergraduates in his capacity as university president. This time, however, those students live two metro stops south on the Red Line.
Though Bacow was just announced as Harvard’s 29th President Sunday afternoon, his tenure at Tufts—as well as administrative roles at other universities—hint at likely leadership tendencies going forward. He will be the first Harvard President to have prior experience at the helm of another university since Nathan M. Pusey ’28, who led Lawrence University before being tapped as Harvard’s 24th President in 1953.
In Bacow’s decade at Tufts, he, like Faust, conducted a capital campaign, weathered the 2008 financial crisis, and kept closely involved with undergraduate social life. Despite his years of experience, Harvard will present new challenges—but higher education experts and friends say Bacow has acquired the skills to face them.
Former friends and Tufts students said Bacow’s tenure was marked by active, hands-on interactions with students as well as clear-eyed attention to undergraduate issues like student social life and freedom of speech on campus.
Cavell called Bacow a “champion for undergraduates” and “a perfect pick” for Harvard.
“He was the kind of president who responded to every student email he received and attended our performances and our games,” Cavell said. “I got the sense that he was a real champion for students and particularly for undergraduates at Tufts.”
John S. Wilson, a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers who served as Assistant Provost at MIT, said Bacow’s “humanity” as MIT Chancellor became evident when he visited MIT students after a classmate took his own life.
“It was not something he had to do, it was just the nature of who he was,” Wilson said. “Even people who are in student affairs or mental health are not always comfortable or skillful in these situations. And he was that and then some.”
In addition to one-on-one interactions with undergraduates, Bacow made several larger-scale policy decisions at Tufts on issues also relevant to Harvard.
During his tenure, Bacow was outspoken on issues of free speech. Following racially charged incidents at Tufts—including a series of satirical articles in 2007 implying Muslims were violent and African-Americans were academically unqualified for college—Bacow advocated for freedom of expression and commissioned a task force that eventually created a university-wide policy on the issue.
“The appropriate response to offensive speech is more speech, not less,” Bacow wrote in a letter to Tufts affiliates in 2007. “We must be vigilant in defending individual liberties even if it means that, from time to time, we must tolerate speech that violates our standards of civility and respect.”
In the past year, Harvard student groups have sparked their own debates about free speech by hosting controversial speakers including sociologist Charles A. Murray ’65 and ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli.
Social life forms another issue that might follow Bacow to his new Mass. Hall office.
Current University President Drew G. Faust has worked to limit the power of off-campus social organizations and re-center social life in the residential Houses; at Tufts, Bacow’s major social life interventions focused on alcohol consumption.
In 2011, he ended a decades-long “Naked Quad Run” tradition at Tufts—akin to Harvard’s own Primal Scream—citing safety concerns with alcohol poisoning, physical injuries, and verbal clashes with law enforcement officials.
Graduate School of Education Professor Richard Chait, who worked with Bacow at Tufts, said Bacow often personally intervened in the cases of undergraduate students transported to the hospital for excessive alcohol consumption.
“He had a practice where he invited that student subsequently to meet him in his office and he'd talk with them more as a parent or father and try to get them to pledge that they would never put themselves in that position again,” Chait said. “He did that not because he was president of the university, but because he cared about the students’ lives.”
While Harvard is about to conclude a record-breaking $8 billion capital campaign, fundraising will likely remain a priority for Bacow, who completed a $1.2 billion campaign at Tufts in 2011.
Wilson said Bacow’s history in higher education campaigns has prepared him for the financial responsibilities that come with running one of the world’s richest universities.
“He was a senior officer at MIT during at least two capital campaigns,” Wilson said. “So he certainly was effective at MIT, but then the facts are there about the way he did a very successful capital campaign for Tufts, the biggest in its history.”
In that campaign, Bacow doubled the endowment to over $1 billion for the first time in the university’s history. During his tenure, the Tufts endowment grew from roughly $600 million in 2001 to over $1.4  billion in fiscal year 2011.
“If you double anybody’s endowment, you’re having a meaningful, history-making impact,” Wilson said.
Current MIT President L. Rafael Reif said that Bacow “did a spectacular job fundraising” at Tufts.
“One important thing about fundraising is that you have to understand people very quickly, you have to understand why they would be willing to give, why they give to an institution, and he’s very good at reading people and extremely good at understanding people,” he said.
Despite Bacow’s success in fundraising, his plans were partially derailed by the 2008 financial crisis, which also constrained budgets at Harvard. In 2006, Bacow launched the Tufts campaign with the explicit goal of moving towards need-blind admissions. The need-blind policy, though, was suspended in 2009 as a result of financial constraints.
Faust—the first female president of Harvard—made issues of diversity key to her tenure.
While at Tufts, Bacow created the University’s Office of Institutional Diversity. He has also repeatedly discussed the importance of the contributions of immigrants to the country. He often mentions he is a child of immigrants himself.
Wilson said Bacow also worked as a member of the advisory board under the Obama administration when Wilson worked at the White House with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities initiative.
“It was a no brainer to have us with us in the first term of Obama administration for the advisory board,” Wilson said. “So he’s worked at multiple arenas, at a place like MIT, Harvard, Tufts, and in the HBCU arena in a different way. And has been effective in every arena where I’ve seen him operate.”
Several former colleagues said issues related to diversity are a priority for Bacow.
“The person that I know is very sensitive to gender issues, to diversity issues, to inclusion issues, so I think he would do a very good job working with people at Harvard,” Reif said. “I think he would be a great leader to clarify and explain Harvard’s position and to make significant progress in the diversity and inclusion front.”
Nonetheless, despite calls for diversity during the presidential search, Bacow will be the 28th white man to hold Harvard's highest office.
Higher education expert Kevin M. Guthrie said he has worked with Bacow in the past and described the future University president as “incredibly empathetic.”
“He’s obviously not a person of color, so he's not that, that's for sure,” Guthrie said. “But he's very committed to issues surrounding diversity, at least in what I know of him personally.”
Fellow higher education expert Thomas D. Parker ’64 said Bacow has a good record on diversity issues at his previous institutions, but will likely have to be particularly sensitive to them in his new role.
Many higher education experts and former colleagues said Bacow’s adept management at past institutions will serve him well in his new role.
Chait said he was “ecstatic” when he heard Bacow would assume the Harvard presidency. Chait, a long-time colleague and close friend of Bacow, previously worked with him on the Board of Trustees at Wheaton College and  served as an advisor to Bacow while they worked at Tufts.
“This was an occasion where the best university in the world appointed the best president in the world. There’s delightful symmetry to the choice,” Chait said.
Tufts professor and former Harvard Board of Overseers President Leila Fawaz, approached leaving a reception for Bacow held in Loeb House Sunday night, called his selection “a wonderful choice.” She said Bacow was well liked by “all the staff” at Tufts.
Parker said Bacow’s “extraordinary track record” made him a clear choice for the presidency.
“It’s obviously a very sound appointment. It’s a very safe appointment,” Parker said. “I can’t imagine anyone taking very serious exception to this appointment, which of course is one of the reasons it happened.”
Chait pointed not only to Bacow’s long track record, but also to his “extraordinary combination of skills and traits.”
“He's sort of the Tom Brady of university presidents,” Chait said. “And by that, I mean he's at the top of his game when most of his contemporaries have left the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball completed a weekend sweep of Princeton and Penn in its first full Ivy weekend back at Lavietes Pavilion, re-positioning itself back at the top of the Ancient Eight standings.
Having taken down the previously unbeaten Quakers Saturday afternoon, the Crimson are comfortably situated with a 7-1 conference record to at least qualify for the four-team Ivy League Tournament in early March. With Penn the only other team over .500, Saturday’s victory not only gave some breathing room for Harvard, but showed that the Crimson’s talented core could wreak havoc across and beyond the Ivies heading towards March.
“It gives us really good reassurance, knowing [Penn] is beatable,” sophomore wing Justin Bassey said. “For us mainly we want to take it one step at a time and not get too far ahead of ourselves. Coach always mentions we don’t want to win a championship, we want to become a championship team...This is definitely a big confidence booster for us.”

FEW FOULS
Sophomore forward Chris Lewis had a breakout game Saturday and left the Quakers with no answers on the defensive end. Going 10-of-14 from the field and knocking down a career-high 25 points, Amaker’s primary low post ball-handler was particularly comfortable spinning to the baseline and finishing off the left backboard. This came at no surprise to Penn, as Lewis’ back-to-the-basket skillset earned him 17 points last weekend against Cornell.
A critical determinator for Lewis’ in-game success may not be how he matches up against his defensive opponents—the long stretch of 6’8” Quakers forward AJ Brodeur gave Lewis little trouble—but as simple as staying on the court.
In games against Brown on Jan. 27 and Princeton Friday night, the Alpharetta, Ga. native was limited to 15 minutes of action due to extensive foul trouble. Against Princeton in particular, Lewis had to be taken out of the game within the first five minutes of the second half after venturing just one foul away from the maximum. Without Lewis, sophomore forward Henry Welsh provided some important minutes off the bench.
However, the ball without Amaker’s key interior cog stayed for longer stretches of time on the perimeter on the offensive end. Defensively, Lewis’s teammates like sophomore forward Seth Towns and freshman forward Danilo Djuricic incurred greater responsibilities in the paint, resulting in both tallying a combined nine personal fouls in the game.
“We tell our guys on the ball, don’t bail them out,” Amaker said. “We can’t foul the dribbler. We tell them, you got help behind you. There are times that we did it very well, there are times when we need to be better at it. That’s the difference, in trusting your help and not falling into what you feel like you have to make a heroic play on the ball to stop someone.”

In the Penn contest, only Towns and sophomore point guard Christian Juzang hit the three-foul mark. The referee’s whistle was completely quiet on Lewis as the forward stayed on the court for over 30 minutes.
The conclusion is clear for Amaker’s frontcourt anchor: greater defensive composure grants remarkable returns on the offensive end.
FEW GIVEAWAYS
The Princeton-Penn weekend was the first time this season Harvard went two consecutive games without tallying double-digit turnover marks.
Moreover, the six turnovers Saturday afternoon was the lowest since last season’s finale against Yale.
The Crimson’s slow and methodical pace offensively led to easier opportunities at the basket, particularly with the team continuously feeding Lewis on the interior and flowing outward from him. Noticeably improving in his overall passing composure and IQ, Lewis logged just one turnover Saturday.
“I give it all to my teammates who were feeding me, trusting in me to keep going at it,” Lewis said. “It also helps when I have great perimeter shooters to pass it out to so it makes it hard for those who need to double-down.”
Quakers coach Steve Donahue surprisingly avoided double-teaming Lewis during the game, instead keeping defenders closer to the Harvard wings. Despite shooting just 5-of-15 from deep Saturday, the Crimson backcourt attacked the rim at a much greater rate than Penn. Bassey and Towns each converted and-ones of their own as Harvard took 21 free throws in the contest, compared to just nine from the Quakers.
“We like to play inside-out,” Amaker said. “This doesn’t just mean a post player, but get the ball to the paint and driving it, you can drive it in and they kick it out.”
With sophomore point guard Bryce Aiken still sidelined, a positive flow from the Harvard offense from both the inside and outside is certainly an encouraging sign for the Crimson.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Over the weekend, the Harvard women’s tennis team came away from the ECAC Championship tournament with two losses against Princeton and Penn on Friday and Saturday before picking up a win against rival Yale to cap off the weekend. The tournament took place in Princeton, N.J., and the Crimson finished the weekend in seventh place out of eight participating teams.
Juniors Isabel Jasper and  Erica Oosterhout were standout performers on a weekend in which Harvard got a taste of some of its Ivy League foes. In the last match of the weekend against rival Yale, Jasper came away with a fifth singles win and a 6-2 win in third doubles with  freshman Neha Gupta. Jasper and Gupta also sealed the doubles point in the match against Penn on the second day of the tournament. Oosterhout picked up an important singles win against Penn on Saturday.
“I think the support of the team has really allowed me to do well in singles this year,” Oosterhout said. “We have a great group of girls on this team and the encouragement from the team while I’m playing helps me stay fired up.”
Throughout the tournament, the Crimson was particularly strong in its doubles. All weekend, the Crimson saw a lot of its success in doubles play. Harvard was able to pick up the doubles point against both Yale and Penn.
“As a team we have really been focusing on our doubles play,” Oosterhout said.  “We have made it a point to try and come out of the gates strong and have high energy in the doubles matches.  I think all of the doubles teams have improved significantly since the fall.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 1
During the last match of the tournament, Harvard came out with its first victory. Oosterhout and sophomore Natasha Gonzalez started off the match with a win against the Bulldogs’ Caroline Amos and Sunday Swett in second doubles, 6-1. The Crimson’s third doubles team of Gupta and Jasper won, 6-2, solidifying Harvard’s doubles point.
The Crimson was also solid in its singles performance during the match against Yale. Freshman Anna Li defeated Swett in fifth singles, 6-2, 6-3, and Jasper topped freshman Sarah Cameron, 6-3, 6-4, in sixth singles. Gonzalez solidified the win for the Crimson by beating the Bulldogs’ Elizabeth Zordani, 7-6, 6-4, in third singles. Oosterhout was also leading her match against Valerie Shklover, 7-5, 6-5, when Harvard was declared the winner.
“Our Penn match we competed really well. We showed excelled composure throughout the match,” Green said. “The result just came down to a few points at the end. As far as execution is concerned we just didn’t execute the way we wanted to. We improved the next match against Yale and we were able to close out big points when we needed to.”
PENN 4, HARVARD 3
During the second day of the tournament, Harvard was edged out in a back-and-forth match. Oosterhout and Gonzalez won their match against the Quakers’ Jimena Rodriguez-Benito and OJ Singh in second doubles. Gupta and Jasper solidified the doubles point by defeating Penn’s Marta Kowalska and Maija Curnic.
The top of the Crimson’s singles lineup was dominant against Penn on Saturday. Oosterhout and captain Annika Ringblom each won their singles matches. Oosterhout beat senior Lina Qostal in two sets, 7-5, 6-1, and Ringblom won in two sets, 6-4, 6-0, over Penn’s Jimena Rodriguez-Benito. At the bottom of the singles lineup, though, the Quakers earned four straight wins to secure the victory.
PRINCETON 4, HARVARD 0
The top-seeded Tigers opened the weekend with a sweep on their home courts. The doubles team of Oosterhout and Gonzalez had a strong showing against Clare McKee and Katrine Steffinson of Princeton, but the Tigers  managed to claim victories in first and third doubles to secure the all-important doubles point
The Tigers proved to be just as tough in singles Princeton’s Stephanie Schrage and Tiffany Chen defeated Crimson sophomore Irene Lu and freshman Anna Li, respectively. Gupta fell to the Tigers’ Gaby Pollner in fifth singles to solidify Princeton’s win.
“Some of our team goals ride around competing at our highest level by the end of the season and also learning to control all the things that are in our control,” Green said. “If we do those two things well we know we have a shot and reaching our potential.”
Gonzalez defeated Princeton’s McKee and Ringblom won her match against Nicole Kalhoun, but it was not enough.
Even though the Crimson only won one of the three matches this weekend, there is still plenty of time for the team  to improve before the time that Ivy matches start in March. Looking ahead, the the team’s goals include getting better one week at a time.
“We have a lot of time between now and [Ivies],” Green said. “Our main focus is just to take it one match at a time so I’m not really looking at the lineup that far in advance. We just want to get a good week of rest and practice in and get ready for our next opponent and that is BC.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just one loss would mean elimination from contention for the Ivy League title. Two wins, and No. 3 men’s squash would have a shot at a split crown with No. 2 Columbia and its second consecutive league championship.
On a weekend when Harvard needed to win against both Yale and Brown to remain in Ivy League contention, the starters delivered. However, the Lions likewise delivered in their weekend matches, maintaining their undefeated Ancient Eight record and barely eclipsing the Crimson (11-1, 6-1 Ivy) for the title.
Harvard breezed through its pair of must-win contests, but Columbia nearly lost its final match against Penn. The Lions were knotted at four all through eight matches with the Quakers. However, Osama Khalifa put to all doubt to rest as he dispatched Penn’s Andrew Douglas in three games, securing Columbia’s place atop the league standings and its first outright championship.
“It was definitely disappointing to come so close to an Ivy title, but I...am confident that we will use that as motivation in the coming match against Trinity and the national championship,” sophomore Sean Hughes said.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
The Crimson closed out its Ivy League schedule with a convincing win over No. 13 Brown (7-7, 1-6) at home at the Murr Center. Harvard won all of its games on Sunday, sweeping the Bears in all nine individual matches.
With a pair of victories in the second match of the weekend, Hughes and co-captain David Ryan maintained their undefeated marks this season. Hughes has not lost a match in his collegiate career, going a perfect 26-0 so far.
“We play every match with the same diligence and focus,” Hughes said. “I think this attitude has led to these good results.”
This year, Hughes has anchored the number three spot, while Ryan has played the majority of his matches at the four.
Aside from the pair of undefeated Crimson, Harvard’s seven other competitors had no difficulty with Brown’s challengers. At the four slot, co-captain Madhav Dhingra closed out his match with an 11-0 victory, and 22 out of the team's 27 games were decided by more than two points.
HARVARD 9, YALE 0
The Crimson remained afloat in the battle for the top Ancient Eight spot on Friday. Traveling to New Haven, Conn., Harvard swept No. 9 Yale (8-8, 2-5) for its sixth consecutive win.
“It was an away match against an experienced team, so it showed that the hard training we've done over the season has paid off,” Hughes said.
Saadeldin Abouaish has faced some rigorous competition at the top spot all season, and once again the sophomore displayed his penchant for winning under pressure. Abouaish won the first, third, and fifth games of his match, and each win required more than 11 points to secure.
Sophomore Timothy Brownell picked up a rare come-from-behind victory, competing in the second position. Brownell dropped the first two games of his matchup against the Bulldogs’ Harrison Gill, but he clawed back for three close victories to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
The shutout was the team’s first against Yale since 2007.

In its first Ivy League road trip of the conference schedule, the top two teams of the Ancient Eight proved too much for Harvard women’s basketball. The Crimson’s win streak was snapped at six with a pair of losses at Princeton and Penn this weekend.
The Tigers (16-4, 6-1 Ivy) and the Quakers (15-5, 6-1) are tied atop the Ivy League following lopsided wins over Harvard (13-8, 5-3). The Crimson fell to third place in the Ancient Eight upon the conclusion of its road trip. In its worst offensive weekend of the season, Harvard shot just 29.4 percent from the field in its two games against the top two defenses in the conference.
“It was completely unexpected,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we were much more ready to play both of those teams.”
PENN 69, HARVARD 49
Due to an uncharacteristically, offensively slow first quarter, the Crimson was unable to mount a comeback from the early deficit. Harvard scored just 10 points in the first quarter and 11 points in the second, compared to Penn’s 25 and 20, respectively.
The Quakers’ explosive start was thanks to a hefty 14-0 run. After sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm hit a layup to start the game, Penn took control and refused to look back. The Crimson’s early 2-0 lead would be its only of the weekend, lasting 53 seconds.
Harvard eventually stopped the run with a three-pointer from sophomore guard Katie Benzan. Benzan would finish the game with 14 points, the only Crimson player to hit double digits. By that point, the damage had been done. Another explosive quarter for the Quakers made the score 45-21 at the end of the first half.
Harvard made up some ground in the fourth quarter thanks to four three pointers, two of which came from junior guard Kelsey Bogdan, but the game already out of hand. Bogdan finished the game with nine points, all on her trifecta of three-pointers, both career highs.
For the Crimson, early season issues reared their ugly heads for the first time in awhile. Harvard committed 22 turnovers in the game. In addition, the Crimson shot only 31 percent from the field and 37.5 percent from the free-throw line.
PRINCETON 80, HARVARD 47
Slow starts proved the key weakness for Harvard this weekend, as the Crimson never even took the lead against Princeton.
“For us to start both of the games with an extraordinary amount of turnovers is perplexing and I’m not sure how it happened,” Delaney-Smith said.
The Tigers took total control of the contest in the third quarter, quickly starting off the second half with explosiveness. Princeton started off the quarter with a 17-2 run, effectively burying Harvard into a hole that was too hard to escape. By the time freshman forward Jadyn Bush helped break the run with free-throws with 4:36 left in the third quarter, the Tigers were leading 55-31.
Princeton had a 14-0 run of its own. The Crimson had kept the game close for the first seven minutes of the contest, with the score 11-7 with 2:07 left to play in the first. The Tigers quickly responded with a three-pointer and carried the momentum well into the second quarter. Harvard responded with a quick 8-0 run of its own, of which junior co-captain Madeline Raster was responsible for five points.
Princeton would respond to make the game 38-25 with just six seconds left in the half. Raster once again worked her buzzer-beater magic to put a jumper through the net as the time expired, making the game 38-27 at the half.
The Tigers would take its largest lead of the contest of 35 points with 7:52 left to play in the game, and the Crimson spent the rest of the contest trading baskets with Princeton.
When the final buzzer sounded, Harvard had accumulated just 47 points, its worst offensive outing of the season. This was due in most part to shooting a mere 27.9 percent from the field against the tenacious Tiger defense.
“We have to figure out how to put it behind us and make whatever corrections we need to make and move forward,” Delaney-Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team booked its spot in the ECAC playoffs by picking up back-to-back come-from-behind wins in its final two home matches of the season. Harvard beat Union on Friday night, 3-2, before finishing off Rensselaer, 5-2, on Saturday to complete its first weekend sweep of the season.
“We knew the position we were in heading into this weekend, and being able to pull a 4-point weekend and also get our first sweep of the year came at a pretty critical part of our season.” freshman forward Becca Gilmore said. “It doesn’t stop there though, we may have clinched a spot, but we’re still going into this weekend trying to improve our standing in the ECAC tournament.”
HARVARD 5, RENSSELAER 2
The Crimson (10-13-2, 8-9-2 ECAC) came back after trailing to beat Rensselaer (9-17-6, 6-11-3) by a score of 5-2 in its final home game of the season. Senior forward Kat Hughes scored twice and assisted another, while Gilmore and Brooke Jovanovich added a goal and two assists each for Harvard.
Harvard was tested defensively in the first period. Sophomore goalie Beth Larcom racked up 18 saves in the first frame alone. Senior forward Haley Mullins and Gilmore were called for hooking and checking, respectively, and Hughes almost broke away for a goal-scoring chance despite being in a three versus five situation. Three impressive saves from Larcom kept the game scoreless through the end of the two-skater advantage, and the first period ended with neither side being able to break the other down.
Rensselaer struck early in the second period after a shot from Engineers’ junior defensive player Josefine Hansen squirmed past Larcom and was tapped in by Rensselaer rookie Aimee Raithby. Jovanovich leveled the score just 1:06 later, finding the net following a pass from Hughes for her eighth goal of the season.
With 16:06 played in the second period, Gilmore and Jovanovich combined for a second Harvard score, with the Gilmore putting the the chance away after some skillful control took her past a defender and the goalie in one motion.
Hughes added a third for Harvard before the end of the period, after a defense-splitting pass from Gilmore in the right circle found the wide-open forward just beyond the left goalpost. The assist marked Gilmore’s 25th point in 26 games.
Freshman defense Emma Buckles increased Harvard’s advantage to three goals when she put away a loose puck in front of goal nine minutes into the final period, but this scoreline was short-lived, with Rensselaer’s junior forward Makenna Thomas responding just over a minute later to pull the Engineer’s back within two at 4-2. Hughes managed to put the game away with 1:39 to play, finishing on an open net following passes from Jovanovich and Gilmore, to end the game by a score of 5-2. The result ensures a playoff spot for Harvard with two regular season games remaining.
HARVARD 3, UNION 2
Harvard came out on top 3-2 against Union (5-13-1, 7-20-4) on Friday night in the first of its final two home contests of the regular season. Two-point performances from Gilmore, Jovanovich, Hughes, and freshman defensive player Kate Glover secured the comeback victory for the Crimson.
Harvard found itself down early in the second period, after Union sophomore forward Katelynn Russ found the net just three minutes into the frame. Harvard responded less than five minutes later, after Gilmore jumped on a loose puck and fired into the Union goal to tie the score. Glover and Jovanovich picked up assists on the play.
Midway through the third period, Gilmore and Hughes struck twice within just 1:08 of one another, putting Harvard up by a score of 3-1. Union managed to pull within a goal with 25 seconds remaining, but the Crimson was able to protect its lead long enough to ensure the victory, and collect an important two points in its playoff search.
Friday night’s victory meant that Harvard had a chance to secure a playoff spot in front of its home fans on senior day. A win meant a top eight finish, and thus a playoff berth, but anything less meant that Harvard would have to wait for next weekend’s games against first placed Clarkson and third placed St. Lawrence for a chance to clinch.
“There’s something to be said about clicking after playing together for a while, and this weekend we definitely did.” Hughes said. “But I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we were all working really hard the whole game. It really translates when you’re just hustling that extra inch, things will go your way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team saw its Beanpot title defense end abruptly last Monday  when Boston University freshman Ty Amonte buried a double-overtime goal to give his Terriers the 3-2 victory.
The Crimson (10-10-4, 9-6-3 ECAC) now turns its attention to Boston College (14-12-3, 14-6-0 Hockey East) as the team vies to stay above the .500 mark. Harvard played a portion of its fall schedule in sub-.500 territory and wants nothing less than to return there.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Forty minutes in, the Beanpot consolation game between the Harvard men’s hockey team and Boston College was tied 1-1. 20 minutes later, the teams were going to overtime even at 4-4.
The six-goal explosion in the third frame came from four different underclassmen, each potting the biscuit at the Beanpot for the first time in their careers. The overtime winner likewise came off the stick of a first-time scorer at TD Garden—but the culprit was senior forward Seb Lloyd.
Sophomore defenseman Adam Fox chased a dump-in from junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage, freeing the puck from the Eagles and feeding it into the slot. Lloyd caught the pass all alone in front of BC sophomore net-minder Ryan Edquist and beat him clean.
“We had [an] odd-man rush there,” Lloyd said. “[Fox] picked up the [puck]...and I just knew I had to find a corner. He made a great pass and I was lucky to get some good wood on it.”
The 5-4 overtime win for Harvard (11-10-4, 9-6-3 ECAC) marks the first time the Crimson have bested the No. 19/15 Eagles (14-13-3, 14-6-0) in the Beanpot since 1998—a matchup that also ended 5-4 in Harvard’s favor after some extra hockey.
The win is also the Crimson icemen’s first triumph over a ranked squad all season. While the third-place finish is a far cry from the championship repeat Harvard had in mind going into the tournament, the team will look to build upon its offensive outpouring in conference play.
After a disappointing showing at Union on Friday, coach Donato put the lineup through the blender. Lloyd was promoted to the second line, while Zerter-Gossage, normally on the top line, swapped with sophomore Nathan Krusko on the second line. Two freshmen, Jack Donato and Mitchell Perrault, drew back into the lineup, as did junior defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy. Most surprising of all, sophomore goalie Cameron Gornet made his first-ever start under bright lights, indeed.
“We’re still probably trying to find the right combinations,” coach Donato said. “When you lose one guy, that can affect multiple positions. But we also had some guys that were banged up, guys that were sick. So we had to do some line juggling.”
Earlier, sophomore blue-liner John Marino broke the 1-1 tie for Harvard less than five minutes into the third frame. Edquist kicked out a shot from Krusko, who received a nice drop pass from rookie linemate Henry Bowlby upon entering the zone.
Though Edquist saved Krusko’s shot, Marino punched home the rebound. Soon after, Bowlby himself joined the party on the power play, collecting a pass to the left of the goal and walking in on the net-minder to shoot between Edquist’s wickets.
The Crimson’s 3-1 advantage did not go unthreatened, though. BC rookie Logan Hutsko, one of the team’s leading scorers, tipped a point shot past Gornet while falling to pull the Eagles within one. Later, Perrault and Donato found themselves on a 2-on-1, with Donato firing past Edquist for his first career goal, giving Perrault his first career point on the assist.
“[His] mom, who would’ve been the most excited, was probably somewhere over the North Pole on her flight,” joked coach Donato, referencing his wife’s trip to Pyeongchang to watch older son Ryan’s Olympic play. “He’s worked hard, and I thought he played an excellent game.”
Hutsko shoveled in a loose puck two times in less than a minute late in the third frame to complete his hat trick and tie the game, 4-4. Hutsko’s tallies mark the first BC Beanpot hat trick in 18 years. Ultimately, though, neither his heroics nor the Eagles’ momentum near the end of regulation time could seal the win for the team.
“[Our momentum] carried over into OT...but we just couldn’t capitalize,” said BC head coach Terry York. “Every coach talks about playing 60 minutes, but...we just have to keep getting better so we can play longer at a high tempo.”
One streak that Harvard will be glad to see broken was its dry run on the man-advantage. After not scoring on 17 straight power plays, the Crimson finally struck gold on its first attempt of the night midway through the first period. Fox shot the puck from the left point into the bodies in front of the net. An attempt by sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce was then tipped home by Zerter-Gossage for his first career Beanpot tally. With that and Bowlby’s goal in the third, Harvard went 2-for-4 on the man advantage.
But the Crimson wasn’t always lucky on the power play. The middle frame saw Eagles junior captain Christopher Brown skate to a partial breakaway and, fending off rookie defender Reilly Walsh, beat Gornet short-side.
Gornet, though forced to scramble on several of the BC’s goals, turned away 30 shots on the night (3.83 GAA, .882 SV%) and kept BC off the scoreboard for over 38 minutes. Though the team conceded its two-goal lead before ultimately seizing the game in overtime, the night’s goal-scorers differed from the usual suspects for Harvard. This marks a step towards the scoring-by-committee the team must aim for in the absence of Ryan Donato. Additionally, Fox tied a career high with three assists.
The Crimson returns to conference play next weekend against St. Lawrence and No. 7/3 Clarkson, looking to regain ground in the ECAC in its last home games of the regular season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Neither the Harvard men’s hockey team nor Boston College wanted to be there. But on Monday night, both squads faced off in the Beanpot consolation game after falling to their respective semifinal foes one week ago.
For the Crimson (11-10-4, 9-6-3 ECAC), the battle for third place did not carry any urgent implications, as a conference playoff title is currently the golden ticket for an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. This being the case, the contest was primarily about getting back on track for a Harvard team that had slipped in four of its past five games entering Monday’s tilt.
“We’re happy to get the win,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “It’s not as exciting as playing in the final obviously, but I thought our guys handled some adversity…. I liked the positive energy.”
In some ways, righting the ship is exactly what coach Donato’s group did. The Crimson’s power play experienced a major resuscitation, and the squad is back in the win column after a 5-4 overtime triumph over the Eagles (14-13-3, 14-6-0 Hockey East). In others, the team has yet to iron out certain aspects of its season. The goaltender situation is even more complicated than it was prior to the Beanpot, and ultimately, third place in the Boston hockey classic is a disappointing downgrade from last year’s tournament crown.
A NEW FACE BEHIND THE MASK
This season, something of a position battle has emerged between Harvard’s pipes. Tri-captain Merrick Madsen, the usual starter, entered the campaign as the obvious go-to after logging a program-record 28 wins in 2016-2017. But junior backup Michael Lackey has earned seven starts this season, and his play has made coach Donato more comfortable yanking Madsen on the senior’s off-nights.
On Monday evening, a new layer was added to this goaltender controversy, as sophomore Cameron Gornet was given his first career start amid the uncertain situation in the blue paint. Madsen (7-7-3, 2.20 GAA, .922 SV%) seemed to have earned back the starting role before allowing a savable goal in double overtime last Monday in the Beanpot semifinals. So, Lackey (3-3-1, 2.63 GAA, .906 SV%) started in Friday’s game at Union but ceded three goals in the Crimson’s defeat to the Dutchmen.
“As far as Cam goes…he’s played great in practice and deserved the opportunity,” coach Donato said. “It was a chance for us to get a look at Cam, and I thought he played well. He battled, and it was an opportunity for our players to be excited for all the unselfish work that he does every day in practice.”
For the first 57 minutes of action on Monday, Gornet looked solid for a backstop making his first ever start. The St. Louis, Mo., native had only allowed two goals, putting Harvard, up 4-2 at the time, in prime position to put the Eagles to bed.
Then, Gornet and the rest of the Crimson let up, surrendering a pair of tallies in less than a minute. The goals not only reinvigorated BC but also marred Gornet’s numbers, as the sophomore finished with a pedestrian 3.83 goals against and .882 save percentage in 63 minutes of action.
It remains unclear whom coach Donato will trust with the bulk of the puck-fielding duties down the stretch. Perhaps some stability in net is just what Harvard needs to keep its season rolling during key scorer Ryan Donato’s Olympic absence.
POWER RESTORED
Monday night, the Crimson snapped a five-game power play drought on junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage’s first-period goal. Until the tally in-close on sophomore goaltender Ryan Edquist, the squad had not found twine on the man-advantage since Jan. 20’s 4-3 OT victory over St. Lawrence.
This streak marked Harvard’s longest such dry spell since the 2014-2015 season, when coach Donato’s group went six games without a man-up goal. This season’s stretch accounted for even more fruitless attempts (17) than the deficiency at this time of the year in 2015 (14).
Despite the disparity in attempts between these two power play skids, losing was a common theme. In 2015, the Crimson dropped four out of the six games included in its drought. Similarly, Harvard’s 1-4-0 record since the St. Lawrence game has slowed any momentum the team had generated in the early part of 2018.
With the power play being an integral part of the Crimson’s—and any team’s—game plan, it is no surprise that Harvard’s performance suffered while its man-up unit struggled. From Dec. 30 to the start of these troubles, the team enjoyed a stretch of unbeaten play thanks to a 3.50 goals against average, good for 11th in the country over that span. Since then, prior to Monday’s tilt, the Crimson had potted the puck just 1.40 times per game, which was dead last in the NCAA.
Harvard’s growing power play troubles were only underscored by Donato’s hiatus for the Olympics, which began last Wednesday. As the squad’s offensive centerpiece, the Scituate, Mass., native has played a key role on special teams this season. Prior to his departure, Donato sat tied for first on his team with eight power play points and, perched in his left-circle office, always demanded attention from the penalty killers.
Even without the junior forward there to grease the wheels, the extra-man unit got the job done against the Eagles and even added another score in the third frame when freshman forward Henry Bowlby punched a puck through Edquist’s five-hole. In short, the Crimson finally took care of the elephant in the room—or rather, on the ice—in Monday’s Beanpot consolation game.
PASS THE POT
Much to coach Donato’s dismay, Harvard will have to hand over the Beanpot trophy to Northeastern this year after winning the tournament crown—as well as bragging rights throughout the city—in 2017.
“There’s no question that when you win it, it’s a nice feather in your cap for the summer-long,” said coach Donato with a smile, in anticipation of this year’s Beanpot. “And [if we don’t win it], that’s probably what I am going to miss the most.”
The Crimson leadership set out this season with multiple milestones in mind, an ECAC points threshold and NCAA Tournament aspirations likely among them. The first objective the team could have checked off that list was bringing home a second straight Beanpot for the first time in program history.
“This is something we talked about at the beginning of the year as one of our goals,” said Madsen, a senior leader on the team, back in late January. “We want the Beanpot again. We want to go back-to-back.”
Regardless of tonight’s specific result, the Crimson icemen would have left TD Garden with a dissatisfied demeanor. Harvard waited 24 years between its two most recent Beanpot titles, as Boston University and BC dominated the event. Another such drought in the tournament would bother the Crimson even more now that many of the program’s current players have experienced victory.
The Eagles will likewise strive to reunite with the Beanpot trophy as soon as possible. BC’s last-place finish marks the second time in tournament history and first time since the 1974 and 1975 events that the Eagles have placed fourth in consecutive years.

After Drew G. Faust broke records as Harvard’s first female president, the Corporation and Board of Overseers have chosen one of their own, Lawrence S. Bacow—who is, shockingly, an old white man—for our next president. We know you didn’t read beyond the first two lines of the introductory email sent out by the search committee, so we’ve picked out the most notable and  quotable bits.
“Larry Bacow”
His name is Larry. Larry. For such a distinguished office, it’s pretty pathetic that three Larrys have occupied it. That’s three times the number of Presidential women, and, if it wasn’t obvious already, all those Larrys are white.
“He will bring…wide experience, deep expertise, and an intimate familiarity…”
Could have done without the erotica-esque epithets, William F. Lee, but clearly he’s excited about this pick.
“The son of immigrants”
A not-so-subtle diversity plug, but it falters when followed by the phrase “with three degrees from Harvard.”
“He embraced diversity as a cornerstone of excellence”
See above. Also, why is it considered an accomplishment to “embrace diversity” and accept that diversity is excellent?
“He led the most ambitious fundraising drive in Tufts history”
Ah, now it all makes sense. With Harvard’s woeful endowment prospects, who better to give our hoard of billions a boost than Larry?
“‘Larry, Larry, Larry’”
Apparently, this is what the Tufts kids chanted when he was President. While we got Tufts’  sloppy seconds, for the love of Drew G. Faust, I hope we can come up with a better chant.
Welcome, Larry. We’re glad “the Corporation” set you free.
Sections

It’s official. Lawrence S. Bacow will be the 29th President of Harvard. Whether his selection is good or bad, we really have no clue how to pronounce his last name, which seems to be as mysterious as the lone Cheeto you find in your bed every night even though you never eat them. Luckily, Flyby has compiled a few different ways we think it could be pronounced.
Back-Ow
The man’s 66 years old. He probably has a bit of back pain. Maybe he groans about it by pronouncing his name this way.
Ba-Cow
Mooooooooooooo. Be careful when you’re walking around Harvard Yard late at night. You might tip the poor guy over.
Bow Chicka Wow Wow
I mean, hey, whatever floats your boat.
Drew Gilpin Faust
President of a university during the financial crisis, centralizing administration, fundraising a ton—the guy is basically Drew plus testosterone. He might as well recognize it.
Bacon
I’m hungry. Larry’s last name looks like it. Kevin Bacon is hot. Larry’s last name looks like his. Give me Bacow bacon, regular bacon, and Kevin Bacon, and you might as well kill me now because my life is complete.
No matter how you choose to pronounce Bacow’s name, it’s never going to be as hard to pronounce as “Donald Trump is the President of the United States.”
