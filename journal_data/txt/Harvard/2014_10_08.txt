After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dance is a complicated art form, to say the least. It is in some ways the forgotten medium of Western art: while it once held a proud place as the centerpiece of Greek tragedy, it has been in a long, slow decline from prominence. A mere 100 years after the golden age of tragedy, Aristotle practically ignored dance in his “Poetics.” While the prestige of ballet in the 19th and early 20th centuries brought a certain amount of aesthetic coherence to the art, it is fair to say that only a fraction of the thought that has been devoted to poetry or music has been devoted to dance. It is then perhaps no surprise that modern dance tends to lack clarity as to its own purposes.
The show “Traces,” which is being put on by Quebecois dance company les 7 doigts de la main at ArtsEmerson through Oct. 12, is no exception from this confusion. On the one hand, under the choreographic direction of Gypsy Snider and Shana Carroll, it is a technically magnificent show, filled with arresting images. On the other hand, it is a near-complete failure as a narrative, which is what it purports to be. The program crows, “‘Traces’ takes place in a make-shift [sic] shelter, an unknown catastrophe waiting outside the doors of tarp and gaffer tape. The five characters constructed this clubhouse to live to the fullest what they believe could be their last moments.” It goes on to discuss how the characters “tell stories of their past.”
Minimal biographies are given for each of the dancers at the beginning of the show, but otherwise, the narrative component is very attenuated. It is unclear in most episodes what sort of plot is supposed to be extrapolated from the dance. For example, a dazzling solo aerial performance by dancer Naomi Zimmerman, while flawless in its execution, was entirely disconnected from the apparent action in the scene preceding it (a performance with aerial manoeuvres launched from a seesaw) and following it (a game show parody, closing the show). This raises the question of what exactly this scene was supposed to be telling us, and its dramatic relation to the rest of the show. Efforts to introduce the thematic darkness hinted at in the show’s description—a drawing of a tsunami on an overhead projector, audio from a report on nuclear testing—generally feel facile and silly. The set, featuring hanging rags, various pieces of ruined furniture, and a piano elaborately made up to look as if it has been made from driftwood, adds little to the performance and occasionally distracts from the action.
In spite of this dramatic incompetence, the skill of the dancers and the beauty of the choreography is undeniable. In the mixing of classical and urban dance styles that distinguishes modern choreography, the arrangements are ebullient and transcendent. A satire on ballet, featuring gross exaggeration of the stylistic tics of the form, is followed by an incredibly coordinated and impressive arrangement using basketballs. In another sequence, ostensibly set in a prison, dancers jump from bar to bar while performing heart-stopping aerial techniques. Execution on the part of the dancers is nearly flawless, and errors were recovered from gracefully.
In the face of such beauty, one is compelled to ask why the narrative element is necessary at all, and, if the narrative element is necessary, why it should not be made more lucid so that viewers can appreciate the relation between what they see and what they knows is happening. “Traces” is, in some way, symptomatic of a great flaw of modern art: we want everything to mean something, but we do not want to tell anyone what anything means. We are uncomfortable with things that are beautiful but have no clear purpose, and we are scornful of things that are transparent and easily understood.
“Traces” is worth seeing, but not for anything other than its visual glory. As a storytelling mechanism of any sort, it is a failure, and indeed, to regard it as a narrative is to diminish from its magnificence.

As an a cappella singer and a student of harmony, two musical groups immediately come to mind as some of the most influential artists in my own musical experience: The Beach Boys and Fleet Foxes. If you don’t know Fleet Foxes, I understand—the indie-folk-rock group produced only two full-length LPs in their years together before their members faded into other musical projects. Still, they received critical acclaim and infiltrated the iTunes libraries of several new indie music listeners. If you don’t know The Beach Boys—well, I may be a little more concerned.
These two groups—differing in era, genre, fame, and longevity—provide a great starting point for part one of an in-depth look at the most important features that set albums apart from other forms of recorded music. Their shared emphasis on layering voices and instruments in innovative ways gives their work some simple points of comparison that don’t require tons of explanation for the untrained ear.
“Pet Sounds” (1966) for The Beach Boys and “Helplessness Blues” (2011) for Fleet Foxes offer the best space for this exploration because both represent an expansion of each band’s previous sound, yet are still great for easy, feel-good listening. For all you humanities concentrators out there, the rest of this article will take the form of a close reading of both works as I examine the first two elements that define good albums: the opening and the ebb and flow.
The Opening
“Pet Sounds” opens with the well-known Beach Boys hit, “Wouldn’t It Be Nice.” While the song is energetic and straightforward in structure, it sets the stage for the rest of the album. First, the theme of the lyrics—longing to come of age—goes beyond the oft-superficial surfer references of previous BB hits and begins the most thematically complex album in The Beach Boys’ opus on a solid note. Second, it takes on qualities of a Broadway overture by using changes in key (in the bridge), tempo (the slow section), and texture (by slowly layering in more intricate motifs) that sample what’s in store for the rest of the album.
Funny enough, “Montezuma,” the opener on “Helplessness Blues,” features similar building layers, memorable licks, and lyrical themes to “Pet Sounds,” but it introduces the listener to the feeling of “spacey-ness” that defines the rest of “Helplessness.” While maintaining a steady pulse that is palatable and attention-grabbing, the track builds to an expansive climax and then retreats to end on a chord that feels far from final. When listening to this track alone, this ending feels odd, but it makes perfect sense as a transition into “Bedouin Dress,” which rests comfortably in the key of that strange ending chord.
The Ebb and Flow
Contrast for contrast’s sake has no place on these albums or on any good album—rather, the goal is to create contrasts that feel natural and purposeful rather than abrupt or haphazard. Both bands achieve this ebb and flow within individual songs and across their entire album.
On “Pet Sounds,” the deliberateness of the second track, “You Still Believe in Me,” is a calming re-centering, and the soaring harmonies at the end of the track propel us into the rest of the album.  The placement of the instrumental track, “Let’s Go Away for Awhile” feels like both a welcome break in the action as well as an intensifier between the edgy “I’m Waiting for the  Day” and the feel-good climax, “Sloop John B.” Individual songs use their middle sections to bring the listener to new keys (“God Only Knows”) or to build intensity with an a cappella break (“Sloop John B”). Overall, these contrasts are tied together as a natural progression of emotion using instrumentation and a unified lyrical theme.
The combination of Fleet Foxes’ simple folk roots and their more experimental risk-taking leads to a heightened sense of ebb and flow on “Helplessness Blues.” How can “Someone You’d Admire”—elegant, relaxed, and static—feel natural next to the upended and raucous “The Shrine/An Argument?” Because the latter achieves a level of growth through tension, release, and layering that would sound abrupt if you listened to the first 30 seconds and final 30 seconds consecutively but feels right over the course of the eight-minute song.  Fleet Foxes uses this model and applies it to their entire album, using wholly instrumental tracks and expansive vocal range to make the album feel natural from start to finish.
While both “Pet Sounds” and “Helplessness Blues” have their shortcomings (as all works of art do), they are emblematic of the finesse necessary to craft emotional ideas into long-form music. If The Beach Boys or Fleet Foxes aren’t your jam, though, don’t worry. Whether you acknowledge that both bands display top-notch songwriting and killer harmonies or not, the presence of great openers and natural ebb and flow say a lot about these bands' ability to make a great album. And, as these artists show, these elements have stood the test of time, spanned numerous genres, and defined all great albums for over half a century.

Quote: “Viewers can handle an unlikeable Doctor, but if all he does is rant and rave, he’s in danger of becoming something worse—boring.” Indiewire, hitting the nail on the head.
Doctor Who? No, Really, Who Is This?
After a much-anticipated start with the arrival of Peter Capaldi to the titular role, “Doctor Who” has bobbed and weaved, struggling to retain any of its old charm and pure fun. The new Doctor looks his age but certainly doesn’t act it, making decisions on a whim. Some viewers are discontent with the disjointed direction the show is taking, while others praise the writing. This weekend’s newest episode featured the moon hatching and the splintering of Clara’s relationship with the Doctor that seemed a long time coming.
What if it’s Shonda Rhimes’s world, and we’re just living in it…
Showrunner Shonda Rhimes, among many others, was awarded the W. E. B. Du Bois Medal in Sanders Theatre on Tuesday, just days after ShondaLand’s takeover of Thursday night on ABC. “Scandal” entered its long-awaited fourth season with a flurry of activity, catching the audience up on what we missed off-screen. Two months have passed, and the dynamics have shifted between many of our beloved characters, including the introduction of a brand-new Mellie. Rhimes had promised a return to the core cast, a downsizing that would help the show recuperate after a bit of a messy third season.
In light of the recent New York Times/Shonda Rhimes scandal, audiences questioned how the premiere of “How to Get Away with Murder” would do on its first night. Although still struggling to establish itself after its first two episodes, there’s time for the show to hit its stride, and it’s definitely got enough twists to rival “Lost”.
Olivia Pope’s Summer Reading List...
“Gone Girl” was definitely a literary hit this summer, even making an appearance as the book Olivia is reading on the beach in the “Scandal” premiere as if readers needed any more proof of its status. The film adaptation premiered this weekend on the silver screen. Tracking the story of an unhappy marriage and a wife’s subsequent disappearance, the movie has already made waves and generated some Oscar buzz. The Rolling Stone describes it best when it calls it “the date-night movie of the decade for couples who dream of destroying one another.”
What to say to your friend who’s still secretly a Twihard…
It may be time to grow up, but you’re not only one who remains hung up on the teen romance series. Lionsgate and Stephanie Meyer just announced that they will be choosing five budding female directors to create five new short films based on the series’s characters to be released via Facebook for everyone else who’s still stuck in 2008. So drink your fill and find some other series to love, for all our sakes.
What to Read 
Want to say you read a book before it was a Nobel Prize winner? Pick up Haruki Murakami’s new novel “Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage.” Having lost the Nobel Prize in Literature last year to Alice Munro, this new work of fiction could just push him over the edge for this year’s award.

The MBTA’s announcement last week of its plans to build a new commuter rail station in Allston met with widespread approval from community members and the University, and for good reason. The construction of the descriptively named West Station is a step forward in the MBTA’s attempts to expand its service to underserved sections of the city, and Harvard’s commitment to finance a third of the project is a sign of the University’s interest in its relationship with Allston. Still, as with any public works project, the devil is in the details. While a laudable improvement, West Station must be part of a wider campaign to revamp the MBTA.
Fortunately, such a campaign is afoot, albeit in embryo. The MBTA’s decision to build West Station is taking place in the context of a five-year capital plan, released in January, which promises to expand the Green Line, refurbish the Red, Orange Lines, and Silver Lines, and finish creating the new Indigo Line, an expansion of the Fairmount Line of the commuter rail into some of Boston’s most underserved communities. The plan also incorporates the realignment of the Massachusetts Turnpike in Allston, a proposal that frees up Harvard land and makes the building of West Station possible.
Improved service will bring with it several boons for affected areas. Property values are likely to increase, and the communities will become more connected to the city proper. So long as they are equitably distributed, such benefits are particularly overdue in Allston, whose residents have long had train tracks nearby but no easy way of getting downtown. And with more land from the Turnpike realignment, the area stands to gain more vibrant public space. As Massachusetts Transportation Secretary Richard A. Davey said at the station’s opening, “It’s about a neighborhood.”
But that neighborhood, along with the rest of the city, has reason to demand more from the MBTA. West Station will be a commuter rail station, and its line, as the Boston Globe noted, “runs … sporadically” at non-peak hours. Change may be coming: The MBTA plans to introduce “diesel multiple unit” cars, or DMUs, on the new Indigo line, and has unspecified plans to do the same for the Worcester/Framingham line on which West Station will sit. In theory, these cars will make service more like rapid transit.
Even more basic changes, however, may deliver more substantial improvements. Harvard’s Edward L. Glaeser, the Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics and Director of the Taubman Center for State and Local Government and the Rappaport Institute of Greater Boston, explained on Bloomberg View in 2012 that “Bus Good, Train Bad” is a decent summation of transportation economics. With that in mind, the MBTA should attempt to use buses more creatively in more of the city, including in Allston, where better bus service to the city could supplement the commuter rail and help prevent overcrowding.
Boston’s Silver Line system in Roxbury could be a model. But, as Professor Glaeser noted this March in the Boston Globe, it needs serious refurbishment – as could much of the rest of the MBTA. Seen in this context, West Station is still a significant benefit for Harvard, and for an Allston community that has long seen its transit needs go unmet. But more widespread rethinking is necessary for the MBTA to connect the Greater Boston community more equitably and efficiently.

Many years later, as I faced the septic squad of trashcans outside my window, I was to remember that distant afternoon when I first discovered the wonders of Pert Plus shampoo.
I was about eight years old, and after almost two-and-a-half hours of fieldwork in the bathtub, I had come up with an elixir containing the perfect ratio of water to soap to shampoo to satisfy all my cleaning hopes and needs. The bottles were my beakers—some slender and tapered, some pressed into jagged HDPE polyhedrons. I even threw in a couple of Alka-Seltzers for good measure.
Today I’m mostly out of the bathroom alchemy game. I’m certain my roommate would frown upon attempting to turn toothpaste into gold in our shower on campus, and my family has sufficiently convinced me that it's a little childish. But after that day, there were two things that I would love for the rest of my life: cleanliness and experiments.
For the last few weeks I have been captivated by an event that is bringing these two loves of mine together in a way that has never been attempted before. On October 2, the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi’s Swachh Bharat Mission was officially set into motion. The massive “Clean India” movement, which will ultimately cost upwards of $32 billion, hopes to honor Mahatma Gandhi’s vision—according to the official Swachh Bharat pledge—that India would be “not only free but also clean and developed.” Modi, with broom in hand, is using it this time not to smack MPs who have literally “chests” of cash used to buy votes just “lying around the house,” but to lead by example in the effort to make India radically more sanitary by 2019.
The Swacch Bharat Mission is a display of executive leadership for the ages. The cleanliness pledge began with Modi, but support is cascading through Indian government officials, celebrities, and civilians. This project is not the Indian government’s first ever attempt at a federal sanitation campaign, but it has a far larger likelihood for success, especially given Modi’s Caesar-like ability to gather popular support and conquer seats. The prime minister has called on people of Indian origin outside the country, NGOs, and corporations to join the fight against open defecation, free flowing sewage, and the bores of garbage that accompany the Ganges River’s tidal swellings.
But, as Modi knows, the principal target in this fight must be the Indian culture of indifference toward the problem of public filth. Private homes in India are often spotless, and there are a frankly ridiculous number of pristine five-star hotels in the country. Yet on the streets just outside the Taj Palace New Delhi, all bets are off when it comes to hygiene. Restating self-evident ironies isn’t enough to solve the problem, but neither is throwing villagers piddling incentives to build toilets that can only be reached after wading through India’s bureaucratic mire.
The answer is government, the answer is pressure, and the answer is law. Public cleanliness represents an incredible human achievement, one that can only be attained through both collective dedication and a respected system of rules and regulations. The search for a trashcan or a toilet has to become impulsive, and a prerequisite for that is that there exist enough trashcans and toilets to look for in the first place.
Cleanliness and the respect for law scrub each other on the back. Citizens learn that there are penalties for disrespecting public property, and law holds up its end of the bargain by making government accountable for providing the resources citizens need to actually keep the streets clean. In turn, citizens see that the streets are clean and they respect law even more, because life is a hell-of-a-lot better when you don’t have to play hopscotch over human feces just to get to work.
A little part of me regrets that I personally can’t experiment with shampoo and soap anymore. But amidst a year of world affairs conflagrated with bullying and butchery, it’s genuinely inspiring to see a government experimenting in a way that doesn’t involve Tomahawk Missiles or tear gas.
It’s Modi who is playing with Pert Plus now, and I hope with all my heart that he finds his elixir.

At any given moment, an infinite range of choices lies before each of us. The palette of all the things we can do next. Some are obvious: check email, text a friend, procrastinate doing that problem set, run to a meeting. These actions are so habitual that they don’t take any energy. We can do them robotically, without thinking.
Then there are the more adventurous choices. Go for a walk in Mount Auburn Cemetery. Strike up a conversation with a stranger in the dining hall. See the glass flowers at the Natural History Museum. (They’re actually cool, I promise). Eat hot pot in Chinatown.
To most of us, or at least to me, doing these kinds of things takes initiative and mental energy. We are busy people. Indulging adventure means putting down the to-do list, clearing time in the schedule, and doing something rather than just thinking about it.
But even these examples don’t come close to true adventure. We are lucky enough to be Harvard students, and the choices before us in any given day balloon beyond comprehension. Want a behind-the-scenes tour of any museum or building or stadium in the world? Have a favorite author or musician or political figure you’re burning to talk to? It’s yours if you want it. Someone at Harvard can help you arrange it, or knows someone who can. You just have to be enthusiastic and persistent.
The question is not, “What do we want from our time at Harvard?” The question should be, “What do we want that we’ve never even thought of?”
Here’s some unsolicited advice: If you have ever dreamed of a project or trip you’ll take on once all life's responsibilities finally fall away, you’ve been thinking about taking a gap year. If you’ve ever dozed off in class and seen yourself on a fjord looking up at the northern lights—that’s your imagination crying out for adventure.
Harvard responsibilities are pressing. “After graduation,” you say. “The summer after next,” you justify. Don’t deceive yourself. You will never hit inbox zero. The best time—the only time—is now.
Work at an emu farm in New Zealand. Teach English in Taipei. Road trip through the Rockies or bike across France. Spend time with your grandparents and ask them questions about their childhoods. Tutor. Volunteer at a homeless shelter. Wait tables or busk on the street, and save every penny you can. Write romantic poems and don’t show them to anyone. Watch “The Wire.” Learn to make guacamole and margaritas, and make them again and again. Pick up the guitar and let the world hear your terrible singing voice. You might surprise yourself.
“Isn’t it hard?” people have asked me repeatedly since I returned this September from my own year off. “Is it tough to leave your friends and come back in a different graduating class?”
My answer: Of course it’s hard. It’s hard to stick out. It’s hard to come back and find your friends changed. Hard is the point. A year or a semester off is a chance to ask all the questions you could never answer honestly because they hit too close to home. What do I like about Harvard? What do I hate about Harvard? Why should I go back?
Question everything. Laugh at your character and your habits. Lose yourself at sea and learn not to be afraid. Unless you go through times when you feel lonely and confused, and countless lazy mornings when nothing seems to matter, you’re doing it wrong. Trust your future self to put the pieces back together.
My gap year was the best year of my life, and the best part of it was coming back to Harvard. Because when I dragged my suitcases into Quincy on move-in day, into a suite full of my old friends, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was no place on earth I’d rather be.

Since September, tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets of Hong Kong. The protesters argue that the Chinese Communist Party has broken its legal obligation to hold free elections for the city’s Chief Executive. Beijing’s election proposal would limit candidates to a select few vetted by a committee loyal to the central government, while the protestors clamor for open nominations.
Seen from the narrow confines of “Homo Economicus,” Hong Kongers’ dissatisfaction with the status quo is puzzling. On a per-capita basis, Hong Kong is one of the world’s richest economies; its residents enjoy some of the best health care outcomes in the developed world. The conservative Heritage Foundation’s 2014 Index of Economic Freedom even ranked Hong Kong first—eleven spots ahead of the United States.
Yet tens of thousands of well-to-do Hong Kongers, armed only with umbrellas, have braved tear gas and police batons in the fight for political reform. Economists can no longer afford to ignore the important role of politics in shaping people’s sense of well-being.
Daron Acemoglu, of MIT, and James Robinson, of Harvard, have long argued for the economic relevance of political institutions. Under their theory, inclusive institutions—which include freedom of the press, religion, as well as one person, one vote—promote economic growth by encouraging innovation. By contrast, extractive institutions—among them authoritarian rule—suffocate development.
Of course, the rapid growth of authoritarian China since 1979 would seem to give the lie to this theory. But Acemoglu and Robinson argue that long-run growth under an extractive regime like China’s is unsustainable. For a while, the political elite may benefit from faster growth and may even work to foster it, as they have in China. But as soon as innovation threatens the elite’s monopoly on political and economic power, the elite clamp down and growth halts.
So what does this have to do with Hong Kong?
The answer is twofold. The first possibility is that Acemoglu and Robinson are wrong, and long-term economic growth can continue under China’s authoritarian regime. If so, in several decades China’s cities could look a lot like Hong Kong. But Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution suggests that people may want more inclusive institutions even when their basic economic needs are fulfilled. This scenario must worry the Chinese Communist Party.
The second and more likely possibility is that Acemoglu and Robinson are right, and China’s growth will eventually stall. The Chinese Communist Party has an urgent need to maintain high growth: each year, millions of workers move from rural areas to urban centers looking for work. Should growth slow and jobs become scarce, popular support for political and social reform could grow.
Hong Kong’s Umbrella Revolution is the highest-profile defiance of Communist Party authority since Tiananmen Square (unlike the 2008-9 unrest in Xinjiang and Tibet, these protests strike at the very heart of China’s economic system). Despite the best efforts of Chinese censors, news of the protests have spilled over to the mainland through social media. Even if the Hong Kong protests are unsuccessful at achieving their goals, they could provide a potent example for disgruntled mainlanders. This scenario must also worry the Chinese Communist Party.
Indeed, Beijing’s recent policies may be an implicit endorsement of Acemoglu and Robinson’s theory. President Xi Jinping has attacked corruption and liberalized state-owned enterprises in an attempt to increase economic inclusivity. But these reforms have been exclusively top-down, and have not loosened the Communist Party’s monopolistic grip on political authority. If Acemoglu and Robinson are right, this reluctance to truly reform China’s institutions may mean an end to China’s growth miracle.
Political power can grow from the barrel of a gun, but economic prosperity may prove a little harder to cultivate.

UPDATED: Oct. 7, 2014 at 9:03 p.m.
Harvard’s flagship faculty is growing again and reached the largest size in its 124-year history during Fiscal Year 2014, with 17 hires raising the total number of professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to 730, according to a draft of the Dean’s Annual Report that was presented to Faculty this afternoon.
The size of the faculty had remained flat since the onset of the financial crisis until the last fiscal year. Its renewed growth comes even as the school ran a $77 million deficit, according to a copy of the draft report obtained by The Crimson on Monday. That deficit was smaller than the $122 million gap originally forecasted due in particular to higher-than-expected revenue from non-federal sources of sponsored funding.
Dean for Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan ’79 told Faculty members at the meeting that although she projects on-going deficits for future years, “Our efforts as a community have positioned FAS to withstand continuing financial pressure.”
Endowment distribution to FAS grew 2.3 percent to $624.5 million, and endowment income constituted just under half of the Faculty’s $1.275 billion in total revenue, according to the report. The market value of FAS investments, primarily in the endowment, totaled $15.8 billion, marking a 10.7 percent increase year over year. This increase was fueled by a return rate of 15.4 percent for FAS’s investments, the second highest return in the past seven years.
Funds raised through the launch of The Campaign for Arts and Sciences also contributed to the lower deficit, with $24 million more in current use gifts than anticipated. Kirwan attributed this boost in fundraising to “the successful launch of the Campaign and the implementation of a new hybrid gift policy, which encourages donors to provide a share of certain major gifts in the form of current use funds,” she wrote in the report.
The school spent $109.8 million on House Renewal last year, the bulk of a significant increase in capital project spending during FY2013. Operations and maintenance increased $12.6 million due mainly to the hazardous waste remediation from the House Renewal Program and construction projects in athletics and museums.
The 2013-2014 academic year also marked the first time that more undergraduates concentrated in subjects within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences than in the arts and humanities, according to the report. SEAS concentrators totaled 775 undergraduates, and arts and humanities counted 746.
The two cohorts have been exhibiting opposite trends for several years now. Since SEAS became its own school in 2007, the number of concentrators has more than doubled, from 292 in 2007-2008 to 775 in 2013-2014. Prior to the establishment of SEAS, the growth in concentrators in engineering and applied sciences was relatively stagnant, hovering just below 300 concentrators for the five years leading up to the school’s formation.
Meanwhile, the trend for the arts and humanities has pointed consistently downward, falling from 943 concentrators in 2007-2008 to 763 in the past academic year.
While the size of the Faculty has grown, its composition has changed as well.
Gender parity for external faculty offers was achieved for the last academic year after disparities of 10 and 20 percent in the two previous years. Twenty-nine men and 29 women were offered tenure-track positions in 2013-2014.
Still, the faculty’s gender ratio remains disproportionately male-heavy, with 532 men and 198 women, according to the report.
“We’re not done, we’ll continue in this area, but the accomplishments, they are something for us to celebrate,” FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said at the Faculty meeting.

Islamic states that govern themselves according to both religious and secular principles are not necessarily undemocratic, argued Islamic Studies lecturer Jocelyne Cesari at an event hosted by the South Asia Institute Tuesday evening.
Cesari, who recently released a book entitled "The Awakening of Muslim Democracy: Religion, Modernity and the State," explained that Islam is part of the social and political fabric of many Islamic nations. She said that her case studies included secular states and states in which religion "does not ostensibly play a big role," and that she observed that some states established what she called "hegemonic Islam."
“Many states take on one type of Islam and make it part of the state apparatus,” she said. “It becomes the only organized religion funded by the state, taught in school, and with clerics on the payroll of the state.”
Professor Ali S. Asani ’77, director of the Islamic Studies program, selected Cesari to speak at the event. Asad A. Ahmed, associate professor of anthropology, moderated the discussion and asked audience members for questions.
Cesari responded to inquiries about differences between Islam and other religions by pointing out that these issues of religion and state are not solely applicable to Islamic states.
“At the end of the nineteenth century, Americans who spoke too freely about Jesus got into trouble and were charged with blasphemy,” Cesari said.
One audience member, Mehmood Z. Motiwala, who said he is from Pakistan, asked Cesari how her academic research could be applied to improving the political and social situation in the Middle East.
“I’m a scholar, but answering that is a little beyond my capacity,” Cesari said in response to the question.
After the panel ended, Motiwala expressed disappointment with the lack of tangible action against Islamic influence in government.
“Obviously she is a huge research scholar. My only concern was everyone talks about it, everybody analyzes it, but what are they going to do?” Motiwala asked.
The talk was attended primarily by graduate students, professors, and members of the local community.
“As we’ve been developing the seminar series, we’ve seen an increase in attendance of undergraduates,” said Meghan H. Smith, Communications and Outreach Coordinator of the the South Asia Institute. “It does tend to be more older students.”
Cesari, however, explained that her work is equally applicable to undergraduates and others.
“The undergraduate level is perhaps the most appropriate for my field,” she said. “Theoretically, [undergraduate] students are not already specialized and can bridge the gap between religious and political perspectives.”

For alcohol retailers, Boston’s brews are now just a few clicks away. BevSpot, a nascent online software platform formed by Harvard affiliates to help enable licensed alcohol distributors to sell their products to restaurants and bars, recently received $720,000 in seed funding to develop its services.
Founded last March, Bevspot helps its clients manage their inventories, allows them to order from a broad distributor base, and provides them with business analytics. The company, conceived by entrepreneurs and technology experts from Harvard Business School and MIT, is currently based at the Harvard Innovation Lab.
Founder and CEO Rory Crawford, who is on leave from HBS to work on his company, said he had the idea to create the first comprehensive online alcohol distribution tool when he noticed inefficiencies in the current system.
“What we want most is to make it easy to connect happy customers to happy distributors,” he said.
Chidubem Ezekea, co-founder and chief product officer, said the current goal of BevSpot is to expand to more retailers and states. Currently, the platform primarily serves the Boston area.
According to i-lab managing director Gordon Jones, the mentorship programs, friendly competitions, and cooperative environment at the i-lab make it the ideal incubator for a start-up company like BevSpot.
“Rory and his team have been friendly and engaging members of the community, a fact that we appreciate,” i-Lab Assistant Director Neal Doyle said. “They have been willing to share their experiences and advise other teams.”
The team agreed that the i-lab has been instrumental in the launch of BevSpot.
“It’s great for groups who are in that position where they need a place to work but don’t have enough money for their own place just yet,” said BevSpot Software Engineer Adrian Miguel.
Having recently received seed funding, BevSpot is now looking to become a significant player in the $450 billion domestic liquor market. The company will soon relocate to office space in downtown Boston.
“I’m excited; there’s so much potential for growth,” said Deanna Mastrovito, who joined the team on Monday as the director of business development.
“We are an extremely young, hungry, and hardworking team,” Crawford said. “We are hiring aggressively.”
According to Crawford, internships are available for candidates with web development experience.
“Interest, not age, is what matters,” he said.

CORRECTION: October 8, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed the quotation, “Rory and his team have been friendly and engaging members of the community, a fact that we appreciate.” In fact, i-Lab Assistant Director Neal Doyle offered the quotation.

At their first meeting Tuesday evening, members of the budding Harvard Undergraduate Humanities Initiative addressed the relevance of humanistic pursuits in an increasingly digital and technological world.
The meeting in Boylston Hall was the first step in a broader effort to promote the value of humanistic pursuits for Harvard undergraduates. The Initiative, which at this point remains an unrecognized student club, will focus on offering resources and a community to undergraduate students interested in the humanities.
The less than a dozen students at the meeting emphasized the need for a more visible, centralized place to explore post-graduation applications of the humanities outside of traditional paths like professional school or academia.
“This kind of organizing around the humanities hasn’t really been done in this way at Harvard yet,” said Josh E. Stallings ’17, who is spearheading the Initiative.
Stallings discussed a number of long-term goals he has for the Initiative. Stalling said he envisions the Initiative connecting students with career opportunities, both during the summer and after graduation, from employers who are interested in students with humanities backgrounds. He also said he hopes to create a community for students interested in the humanities.
Tamara S. Fernando '16, who studies History and Literature and attended the meeting, said, “I think having a community of scholars, of undergraduates studying the humanities, would be super beneficial.”
Meanwhile, Stallings is working towards formalizing a leadership structure and planning more events. He hopes for the Initiative to receive official recognition from the Office of Student Life in the spring.
Ideas for the Initiative developed this past summer, when Stallings studied on campus as part of the Summer Humanities and Arts Research Program. Through his research during the program, Stallings became inspired by the Humanities Ambassador’s Club at New York University, which informs students there of the diverse professional possibilities that humanities students have and creates a community for undergraduate students interested in the humanities.
Doris Sommer, professor of Romance Literature and Languages and African and African American Studies, worked with Stallings over the summer on the Initiative. She emphasized the importance of addressing concerns some students had raised about limiting their career options by concentrating in the humanities.
“[The Initiative] is a way of showing that there may not be a contradiction, that training in the humanities may be a very good background for careers that they’re interested in, or ones that they haven’t even identified yet,” she said.
At a time when only 9.2 percent of the surveyed Class of 2018 has reported plans to concentrate in the humanities, Stallings hopes to turn his summer brainstorming into more tangible actions.
“I think it’s absolutely a need that we have,” Stallings said.

University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 defended the change to Harvard’s health care benefits for non-union employees Tuesday, arguing that increases in health care costs at Harvard necessitated adjustments, including the introduction of a deductible in some instances and a 10 percent co-pay for policyholders.
“Nobody believes this is the perfect solution,” Garber told members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at their monthly meeting. “But there's a lot of optimism that this will help us to sustain generous health benefits.”
He said that the University Benefits Committee, which considered and ultimately recommended the changes, sees the new policy as a compromise that allows for risk protection. Without the policy change, policyholders’ premiums would have gone up by about 3.6 percent, according to Garber.
Instead, premiums were reduced by 2.5 percent and increased costs passed on to policyholders in the form of a $250 deductible at the point of care, except for routine office visits and tests, and co-payments of 10 percent after a $250 threshold is surpassed for individuals and $750 for families.
“There’s been a lot of pressure to think about whether our health plans are providing the best bang for the buck,” Garber said.
Although acknowledging that data was difficult to come by, he noted that nationally, “the trend is overwhelmingly to have employees bear more of the costs.”
Garber’s remarks were prompted by a question from History professor Mary D. Lewis, who called the new policy “regressive” and asked when and how it might be reversed.
Lewis said that the new policy will be especially burdensome to junior faculty and to those whose family members have preexisting medical conditions, a comment that elicited applause from faculty members in the room.
In his response, Garber also alluded to a Crimson article published Tuesday detailing how the University Benefits Committee mischaracterized the rise in benefits expenditures when justifying the changes to employees in official University communication. The article found that contrary to official statements, expenditures primarily increased during a two-year period in the early 2000s and have since remained steady.
Garber said that “at Harvard it doesn’t matter much what period you use, ten years or more, the fraction of our employee compensation that is attributable to medical expenditures has risen,” though he noted that “what’s really at stake here is what future health expenditures will be, not what past ones are.”
Lewis maintained her position in response, arguing that ​"since we are not just a business but a community, I think we should be absorbing that risk for junior faculty,” who she said are most at risk financially.​
A discussion of FAS’s annual report followed the question period, before History professor Alison Frank Johnson detailed the University’s new sexual misconduct policy, as well as FAS’s interim policy and procedures. Johnson chairs the FAS committee working to revise and present that interim policy to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith by the end of the term.
In accordance with rules from the Department of Education, Johnson said the University policy allows both victims and the accused access to an advisor during the proceedings of their case. This advisory role may be filled by any individual, including lawyers.
Lowell House Master Diane L. Eck said that the allowance of lawyers might create “inequity” in that some students can afford lawyers, while others cannot, an issue which Johnson acknowledged as serious.
Following Johnson’s presentation, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 said that the University policy had significant flaws, including the failure to address the root cause of sexual misconduct at Harvard, which some, he said, identify as “rape culture,” and others as “hookup culture.” The new policy, instead, simply serves as a “punitive” measure, he said.
In response to the question, Johnson said that the “policy is not primarily designed to be punitive. It is admittedly reactive. We are reacting to events that have already taken place.”
Further discussion of the policy centered around the legal foundation of the federal regulations and the scope of a prohibition banning relationships between faculty members and the graduate students whom they supervise.

UPDATED: Oct. 8, 2014 at 1:27 a.m.
Yale is currently considering a proposal to adopt a version of Harvard's Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” for its undergraduate curriculum, Yale Computer Science Department head Joan Feigenbaum confirmed Tuesday.
Feigenbaum said that CS50 course instructor David J. Malan ’99 sent her an email over the summer proposing an idea for a “joint Harvard-Yale CS50.” She said Yale is currently in the process of reviewing the proposal, which must be approved by her department, Yale’s Course of Study Committee, and eventually the college’s full faculty.
If the proposal is approved, Malan’s CS50 lectures would be streamed to Yale, where an on-the-ground instructor and support staff, including teaching fellows, will hold standard sections and office hours and handle grading, according to Feigenbaum. She added that Malan may even visit New Haven to deliver a few lectures.
Though Malan lectures in-person on Harvard’s campus, all lectures are also offered as video modules, and enrollees are not required to attend lectures.
To move forward, the proposal would also require the approval of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Feigenbaum said. Neither Computer Science Area Dean David C. Parkes nor Director of Undergraduate Studies Harry. R. Lewis ’68 responded to repeated requests for comment on the matter. CS50 course manager Daven Farnham declined to comment.
Malan, for his part, said that he “recently” proposed to Yale that the CS50 staff work with the university on some sort of collaboration, but would not comment on whether the department was in the process of approving the new course or not.
“We are focused entirely on our fall semester right now,” Malan said. “We have indeed spoken with Yale about the process of collaborating on some course that might be jointly offered on both campuses, but as of now we have no plans.”
Malan declined to comment on the steps moving forward with the collaboration, but did note that the “course proposal process, if anything like [on] this campus, takes quite a bit of time” and that he is “not surprised if [Yale] might be discussing if and how we implement some joint course.”
If passed by both faculties, the course, Harvard’s highest enrolled offering in five years, would begin at Yale in fall 2015, according to Feigenbaum.
“One of the things that is so exciting about this proposal is that if it stands a chance, if it is approved, and if it works out, [it will] allow us to combine the great things about online instruction and the great things about person-to-person, face-to-face on-campus instruction,” Feigenbaum said.
The proposal comes at a time when the number of computer science majors is steadily increasing in universities across the U.S.. According to Yale’s Computer Science Director of Undergraduate Studies James Aspnes, the college has around 200 undergraduate majors, compared to Harvard’s 253.
CS50 currently enrolls 848 students, not including those students who take it as a massive open online course through HarvardX. As of Aug. 2013, CS50x was HarvardX’s most-enrolled course, with nearly 160,000 students.
Aspnes acknowledged that the introduction of CS50 into the department could draw students away from its other preparatory courses, like Computer Science 112: “Introduction to Programming,” but he said the department will still offer these courses.
Aspnes added that the department has been trying of late to expand its introductory computer science courses to no avail due to limited resources.
“My understanding is that...Harvard’s CS50 has substantially more resources than we do at Yale,” Aspnes said, noting that he believes the department will receive extra resources from Yale to launch its version of CS50.
Feigenbaum said she is hopeful that the proposal will pass and enrich both campuses, adding that the proposed course could possibly culminate in a Harvard versus Yale hackathon at the end of next fall.
“If Harvard and Yale do it in this joint way…we can build into a combination of online instruction and person-to-person on-campus instruction, and a little bit of friendly rivalry and tradition,” she said.

Just four days after hundreds of Harvard affiliates received a racially charged death threat email, several students expressed frustration and concern over the University’s response to the situation at a discussion event Tuesday night.
Around 30 students, administrators, and Harvard affiliates gathered in Holden Chapel for the discussion. Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña, who hosted the event, encouraged students to use the time as an opportunity to voice their feelings in the wake of the emailed threat.
The administrative response to the threat dominated the evening discussion, as several students raised questions about what they perceived as a lackluster outreach effort from College administrators and the Harvard University Police Department.
College administrators have sent two emails to students regarding the threat—one from Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde that relayed the postponement of a pan-Asian discussion scheduled for Saturday and another from dela Peña that invited students to Tuesday’s discussion.
Some students at the event said that those emails were insufficient, with many adding that they had expected an email directly from the dean of the College regarding the threat.
“All I ask for is a College-wide email...saying there has been a great loss, there has been a great tragedy in our community and in our midst, these are the resources, we feel for you,” said Shengxi Li ’15, who had received the emailed threat.
Li said that she directly emailed Lassonde and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana about the College’s response, and said that she was not satisfied with Lassonde’s response and had not received a response from Khurana by the time of the meeting.
The death threat was emailed to hundreds of Harvard affiliates on Friday afternoon. The author of the email, writing in broken English, threatened that he or she would come to Harvard and “shoot all of you.” The email, which referred to its recipients as “slit-eyes,” was sent mostly to women of Asian descent.
Several additional emails were subsequently sent to Harvard affiliates byone of the accounts that issued Friday’s threat, with some students saying that they had also been emailed personally by the sender. Some Harvard affiliates also reported having previously received emails from the same email account that sent Friday’s threat.
Students at the discussion expressed concern that even while people continued to receive these emails, HUPD had not sent many updates on the investigation. HUPD’s last email to students was sent on Saturday morning and no alert was sent out over MessageMe, the University-wide emergency notification system. One student described the lack of communication as “disconcerting.”
Throughout the discussion, dela Peña said multiple times that she felt “helpless” in the face of students’ questions and concerns because she too did not have any additional information on the investigation or HUPD’s communications. Lassonde spoke infrequently during the discussion except for asking clarifying questions, though he at one point assured students that administrators were concerned about the threats and said this was a “learning experience” for administrators.
At the conclusion of the hour-long conversation, dela Peña said she would reach out to HUPD for more updates, while Lassonde promised students that there would be an email sent out from the Dean of the College’s office.

UPDATED: Oct. 8, 2014, at 4:09 a.m.
Barbara Walters discussed her path to success and shared wisdom gained from interviewing statesmen and stars through a journalism career that has spanned more than half a century in a conversation with David Gergen, professor at the Kennedy School of Government and senior political analyst for CNN, at the Institute of Politics on Tuesday.
Walters, who was the first female to co-anchor a network evening news program, began her career as a writer on NBC News for the "Today" show. In the 1960s, Walters became the first female anchor on the "Today" show to have ascended from behind the scenes as a writer and not as an actress or model.
"It was a struggle because there were no women in the news," Walters said. "When I first went on the air, I had a partner who insisted I not ask any of the serious questions."
Unwilling to settle for the task that her co-anchor had assigned to her, Walters said she had a conversation with the head of NBC News. Part of the resulting compromise was that if Walters obtained an interview outside of the studio, then she could conduct the interview herself. The first interview she got was with Henry Kissinger.
Walters went on to interview world figures, including Cuba's Fidel Castro, China's Jiang Zemin, Russia's Vladimir Putin, and Iraq's Saddam Hussein, while continuing her style of personality journalism.
"I'm fascinated by what makes people tick," she said. "A lot of my interviews even with heads of state are: 'Tell me about your childhood,' 'What is it about you that made you the person you are today?'"
Starting with former U.S. president Richard Nixon, Walters has interviewed every following American president and First Lady.
Regarding her multiple interviews with Nixon, Walters said he always "seemed constipated to me."
"Nixon wanted to be liked, to reach people," she said. "He didn't know how—in his private or professional life. It was ultimately tragic, and he never found himself."
Walters said that President Barack Obama seems to be a "solitary figure" in the White House who is very involved with his family and children and may not see and listen to enough people.
"This is a man who had to spend his childhood pleasing people," Walters said of Obama. "His father didn't see him, his step-father wasn't there, his mother abandoned him, and he spent all of his early years trying to be accepted and liked. We have to recognize the mark it made."
Walters said that she believes that true leaders have vision, passion, a desire to do something beyond trying to get reelected, and a "commitment to something that is bigger than themselves," which is a combination that she said she has not seen in recent presidents.
Gergen described Walters as having a "friendly" relationship with Hillary Clinton. Having interviewed Clinton several times since she was First Lady, Walters said, "I think she would make a very good leader as president." Walters said that even though Clinton went through a tough campaign, "I don't see how you could get so close to the triumph [and] then walk away."
Near the end of the conversation, Gergen played a clip of Walters’ famous interview with Clint Eastwood in 1982, which she described as "the most flirtatious interview I've ever done." Walters said Eastwood asked her if she would come to his home for dinner following the intimate interview and that she missed the chance to have a relationship with Eastwood, who later went on to marry and then divorce another reporter. But she said she has not lost hope.
"Who knows what can happen,” she said. “I might come back and be Mrs. Clint Eastwood."

Kennedy School of Government officials shared the school’s proposal to dramatically remodel and expand the school’s campus with the Cambridge Planning Board and local residents at the Board’s meeting on Tuesday. At the meeting, which drew more than 20 residents, some members of the Cambridge community raised concerns about the impact of the school’s proposed renovations on the surrounding area and nearby construction.
If approved, construction for the more than $100 million project—which includes the creation of three new buildings and the elevation of the school’s current courtyard—would likely begin following Commencement and aims to wrap up by Jan. 2018, according to the Kennedy School’s executive dean, John Haigh.
Haigh opened the discussion Tuesday night by presenting the project’s three primary goals: drawing speakers to the school by creating high-tech buildings, facilitating research and collaboration between faculty members, and better incorporating non-Harvard affiliates.
“We are very much oriented on bringing the public into the campus,” he said. “We are not the Business School. How do we [create] a non-elitist perspective for the campus?”
Haigh said that the proposal will aim to meet this goal by better opening the school’s courtyard to the public.
According to Graham S. Wyatt, a partner at Robert A.M. Stern Architects, the firm that will develop the property, the new architecture will convert a retaining wall on the property’s west side into a passageway between the courtyard and John F. Kennedy Park. The changes, developers said, will also improve the visual appeal of the courtyard’s north entrance from Eliot Street.
“This openness idea that [Haigh’s] mentioning is very much what we’re hoping to improve [and] foster,” Wyatt said.
According to Wyatt, the proposed construction will expand the courtyard from 17,000 square feet to 30,600 square feet. The project will also create a 4,200 square foot glass-enclosed atrium, named the “Winter Garden,” between the new South Building and the Littauer building.
Haigh and Wyatt said that the new plans will improve the community’s experience by eliminating road closures like the one that occurred last week when Vice President Joe Biden visited campus.  Developers plan to create a secure space for receiving dignitaries below the renovated courtyard.
“I’m sure everyone appreciated when the Secret Service shut down Memorial Drive,” Haigh said sarcastically.
Cambridge resident Marilee Meyer, like several other residents who attended, said she had some concerns about the project. She asked whether the University had conducted shadow studies to determine the proposed Gateway Building’s impact on the brightness of Eliot Street. Meyer also said she worries that the entrance under the West Building would open JFK Park to the University rather than keep it “contained.”
Still, Meyer expressed optimism about the plans overall.
“Some of the plans are very clever,” she said.
Citing shadow studies conducted by developers, Pebble Gifford, another Cambridge resident who attended the meeting, also discussed fears about the construction’s impact on Eliot Street.
“[The proposed West Building] totally blocks most of the light on Eliot Street during the spring and fall,” she said.
Tom Sieniewicz, a member of the planning board, said that developers should take the construction on Anderson Memorial Bridge into account when planning the construction process.
“I cannot imagine this being a massive construction site with the bridge as it is today,” Sieniewicz said.
A board member said that the bridge would be completed by June 2015, according to the most recent estimate the board received.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 9, 2014, at 1:10 a.m.
Eliot’s House committee plans to spend about $120 per undergraduate resident this year, while Adams’ House committee intends to spend about $70, a Crimson analysis of recently disclosed House budgets found.
The analysis is based on House committee budgets published for the first time by the Undergraduate Council on Monday, in accordance with the Council’s bylaws. They indicate disparities in the ways different House committees raise and spend their funds on activities and events.
The highest projected revenue among those who submitted budgets is that of the Eliot House Committee, which estimates a yearly revenue of about $65,000, including a roughly $5,000 surplus from the prior fiscal year. Only about $54,000 of the total is expected to be spent throughout the year; about $5,000 will be given to charity.
Other Houses planned on less revenue, the reports show. Lowell and Adams House committees estimate budgets of about $30,000 each, while Kirkland and Quincy detailed projected budgets hovering around $40,000 each.
The remaining budgets only detailed revenue for the fall semester. They range from about $10,000 for Mather and Pforzheimer to about $15,000 for Currier and Leverett and around $17,00o for Winthrop and around $20,000 for Dunster and Cabot.
These Houses appear to have not submitted budgets in compliance with the UC bylaws, which require a full year’s budget and projected revenues. The Council, however, held an emergency online vote Tuesday night that will result in full funding for all Houses, UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 said.
“We’d be placing technicalities over the spirit of the legislation by not funding them,” Mayopoulos had said ahead of the vote.
All House committees share similar revenue sources from the Office of Student Life and the UC. Many, however, differ in the amount they intend to raise and spend on House formals and merchandise, according to the budgets.
Eliot House, for example, plans to raise about $25,000 in ticket sales for all of its formals and soiree, and spend about the same amount on its premiere formal—Eliot Fete. Kirkland House committee intends to raise a smaller figure, about $7,000, on ticket sales but spend $21,000 on its spring formal. Other Houses, like Lowell and Adams, intend to expend about $10,000 or less on a similar event.
Meanwhile some Houses, including Quincy and Eliot, estimate more revenue from laundry costs, amounting to about $9,500 or more for the year, compared to other Houses such as Pforzheimer or Mather Houses, which predict about $2,500 in laundry revenue for the fall semester alone.
Those disparities, almost 20 years after the College instituted the housing lottery, have some worrying that House committee revenue streams could further perpetuate inequalities they see among the Houses.
“I don’t think it makes sense that House life is touted as a cornerstone of the Harvard experience, but yet there are huge disparities in the type of programming that can happen for various Houses,” former UC President Tara Raghuveer '14 said. Differences in House committee budgets, she said, could perpetuate this inequality.
Pforzheimer House Committee treasurer Joseph F. Tabasco '15 appeared surprised when told how Eliot’s projected yearly revenue of about $65,000 compared to his House’s fall semesterly revenue of about $13,000.
Tabasco, speaking for himself, said that the difference in budgets could correlate to an inequality.
“It’s tough to tell a freshman…that Houses are treated equally when Houses don't have equal funds to work with,” Tabasco said. “Why would anyone want a House that doesn't have as much money to work with when they want to do House events?”
Mayopoulos, however, argued that though the disparity in House committees’ revenues is apparent, it does not necessarily reflect a larger problem.
“There is nothing inherently wrong with one HoCo having more revenue than another HoCo,” Mayopoulos said. He added that it was still “too early” to render judgments about the effect budget revenue differences may have on broader inequalities in the housing system.
Eliot House Committee chairs Megan B. Prasad ’15 and Tommy Chen ’15, for their parts, point to differing marketing strategies used by Houses to spur sales for events and merchandise as the main source of the disparity in some budgets.
They said their advertising and event planning lead to increased ticket sales, which in turn allows their House committee to spend more money on events like Eliot Fete. The House’s HoCo budget, like that of all other HoCo’s, does not include any endowment funds.
UC funding for House committees does not depend on size.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Humanist chaplain Greg M. Epstein discussed how to live a non-religious life with Sam B. Harris, author of “Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion,” in Science Center Hall B Tuesday.
Harris, a leading and controversial figure in the New Atheism movement, has published several books on the topic of atheism. His new book focuses on spirituality and the individual’s responsibility to achieve his or her own happiness.
“I want people to take away that having a spiritual life need not entail believing in anything on insufficient evidence,” Harris said. “It only requires that you observe your experience more closely in the present moment.”
Epstein, also a leader in the New Atheism movement, has published his own book, “Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe.” Toward the end of this book, Epstein focuses on the importance of community for non-religious individuals, the main topic of his next book.
“I think [my own and Harris’s ideas] can be two sides of a coin, how to have a healthy inner life as a non-religious person and how to have a healthy outer life as a non-religious person,” Epstein said. “[Harris is] talking a little more about the inner life, and I’m arguing that in order to have the healthiest possible inner life we also need community.”
During the discussion, Harris went into depth about what he called a source of dissatisfaction in an individual’s life: the idea that only attaining certain goals, such as getting married or getting a better job, will allow true happiness. He said that this mindset is unnecessary and that an individual can learn to be happy in the moment if they can learn to be present in that moment. Based on this idea, Harris promoted meditation as a conduit into living in the moment and led the audience in a couple of minutes of meditation.
“I think the meditation aspect is something that I have been interested in in the past, but haven't had the chance to do, and I do think what he had to say about spirituality as a nonreligious person is something to take away from,” said Erin M. Williams ’15, a member of the Harvard Community of Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics.
Many HCHAA members came to the event in support of their parent organization, the Humanist Hub. The Humanist Hub at Harvard, which opened this year, works to create a space to address the growing community of agnostic and atheists college students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Law enforcement officials have confirmed that a death threat emailed to hundreds of Harvard affiliates last Friday originated outside the country and is not a current threat to Harvard’s campus, although the investigation into the source of the threat remains ongoing.
Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for the Harvard University Police Department, told Harvard affiliates in a community advisory message Wednesday morning that its investigation “has revealed sufficient information to support the conclusion that that the emails do not pose a credible threat to the campus at the present time.”
Those emails, which included a racial slur and disproportionately targeted women of Asian descent, disrupted campus life this past weekend as police increased their presence and some student groups canceled planned events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Over its past 220 minutes of play, the defense of the Harvard women’s soccer team has done just about everything that a coach could ask for.
The back line has repelled attacks from all corner kicks and free kicks.  In fact, the Crimson has conceded no goals and it has recorded no cards.
The only thing missing for Harvard (6-2-2, 1-0-1 Ivy) over this span has been a victory.
After double-overtime draws against Massachusetts and Yale, a mid-week matchup against Boston University (6-3-3, 2-0-2 Patriot) at Soldiers Field offers Harvard the opportunity to end a two-game scoring drought and return to the win column.
As well as the back line played against the Bulldogs and the Minutemen, those two performances form just part of a larger period of defensive dominance.  The last goal given up by the Crimson came on Sept. 14, when a late Colgate strike propelled the Raiders to a 1-0 triumph over Harvard. Since then, the Crimson has recorded 519 minutes of clean-sheet soccer over five games.
Co-captain Marie Margolius, junior Alika Keene, and sophomore Bailey Gary deserve much of the credit for this streak. The trio of defenders has played in all ten games.
“A big reason why we are so good defensively is because of the mindset of this particular Harvard women’s soccer group,” Margolius said. “All over the field, we have a toughness and a work ethic that makes it hard for teams to get through us and score.”
BU is also coming off a double-overtime tie—this one against Lehigh. While Harvard enters on five-game unbeaten streak, the Terriers have not lost in their last four games, a run that includes two wins and two draws.
Junior forward Jenna Fisher leads the offense for BU. A season after scoring just two goals, Fisher has exploded for five thus far this year. No other Terrier has recorded more than two.
As solid as its defense has been, Harvard has enjoyed little offensive success in recent games. Against Yale and Massachusetts, The Crimson recorded a total of just 10 shots on goal combined, and failed to find the back of the net.
“It’s been a challenge,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “Teams have been making it difficult. We’ve been making it difficult as well—missing by just a little bit.... Obviously that’s a focus for the week, to try and improve our finishing."
If the offense does break out of its slump, then sophomore forward Midge Purce may very well be the reason why.
After a first season that included 16 starts and 11 goals, Purce was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year, the first Harvard women’s soccer player to earn the honor. This season, Purce leads the team in goals and shots, with four and 30, respectively. She notched a score in the team’s first Ivy League game of the year against Penn.
The BU game provides a break for the Crimson in the middle of Harvard’s Ivy League schedule. After playing the Terriers, the Crimson ends the regular season with five games against Ancient Eight opponents. Harvard has a matchup against Cornell, which sits fourth in the current Ivy league standings.
Although the rest of the team’s league schedule looms following this game, Harvard players insist that that they will not look past BU.
“Every game is another opportunity to get better,” Margolius said. “We are fortunate to be able…to play a good opponent like BU during the Ivy League season.”
Last year, the Crimson played the Terriers to a 1-1 double-overtime draw that featured tough defensive play. After the teams traded goals in the first 30 minutes, the game became a stalemate. Harvard and BU combined for only six shots on goal over the 110 minutes of play.
“Two good teams get to play and work on their sharpness before they go into the weekend’s conference play,” Leone said. “ I look at it as a positive—and not just that but [also] a really good team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three months removed from its impressive 2014 World Cup performance, the United States men’s national soccer team is back on the pitch. In preparation for its match against Ecuador Friday night in East Hartford, Conn., the USMNT has made Harvard’s Ohiri Field its home for the week. We decided to catch up with head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.
Q: Now that you’ve gotten to practice here for a few days, what has been your overall impression of Harvard’s facilities?
A: “Outstanding. We’re very privileged to be here and obviously spend a couple of days before we drive over on Thursday morning to Hartford. So far, everything has gone smoothly and everybody seems ready.”
Q: For games such as this one so early in the World Cup cycle, how have you and the coaching staff gone about balancing the roster?
A: “We would like to kind of continue to make this program grow, and [we] can be more flexible. It’s a very interesting time period now because we’re not only building a deeper pool hopefully for the senior team, but at the same time we’re trying to develop talent towards the Olympics in 2016. We decided to leave a couple experienced players out just for the sake of introducing some fresh young players to juggle things around.
“We do what is best for our team. We want to continue with the positive moments that we created in Prague against the Czech Republic with a very young group, so this group is back. We’re mixing it a bit with [players from the] MLS…. We’re very happy to have that group around here, and we want to do well against a good Ecuador side.”
Q: Have you noticed any consequences as a result of failing to qualify for the Olympics back in 2012?
“What you lose is a lot of very, very important international experience for younger players. If you’re not qualifying for the Olympics, they’re really missing out on a huge opportunity.
“The players that went back into the MLS, they had to carry that on their shoulders for quite a while. So we want to make sure that this is not happening again. We want them to have the opportunity to go to Brazil and play those weeks, and take that experience with them to the next step which is obviously the senior national team.”
Q: What can we expect to see from Landon Donovan with this being the last international contest of his career?
A: “We have the understanding with Landon that he obviously starts the game and wears the captain’s armband out of respect for what he did for the program for so many years in an outstanding career. So we want him to enjoy that moment.
“The plan is that he’s playing about half an hour into the game. Two days later, he has a [Los Angeles] Galaxy game coming up, and he’s coming in only on Thursday as well. But obviously it’s a special moment. It’s a special celebration for everybody involved, and hopefully it’s going to be a memorable day for him.”
Q: Have you seen many players like Landon coming out of the American system?
A: “No. I mean Landon had an exceptional career—a very, very special career. Therefore, he gets honored on Friday night, and he should hopefully remember every second of it.
“It’s our goal to find young, new players that fill into those big, big footsteps of a Landon or other senior player that is ready to leave the stage. I think the game is growing at all levels. We’ve made some steps forward, but still, we have a way to go.
“We still often talk about connecting the dots between the youth system and the professional system [as well as] college. We have so many pieces floating around in the United States that still need to get perfected, but definitely it’s getting better. Hopefully, we find the new [Landons] around the block.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s soccer team going for its seventh straight win this Saturday—not having lost since Sept. 13—perhaps it’s time for some perspective. Just two years removed from back-to-back winless Ivy League campaigns, we have entered the Pieter Lehrer era.
Expectations are now much higher in Lehrer’s second season as head coach, and the team has begun to deliver on the lofty aspirations that it has set for itself.
But two years ago, after the winless 2012 campaign, there was no talk of national titles. Harvard instead looked to instill a new culture around the program, taking its time to decide on a coach. Players were brought into meetings to interview prospective candidates as Harvard looked to rediscover the mid-2000s success of a program that rattled off four straight league titles earlier in the century.
Lehrer, once chosen, was not shy about his ambition.
“You look at the basketball program and the excitement and the success that they have had, [and] I think it can be very similar [for the soccer team],” Lehrer noted after he was hired.
Out of the gate, the outlook was not so rosy. The team dropped six of its first nine games, including a brutal last-minute defeat to Yale that former Kevin Harrington ’14 called the most “devastating loss I’ve ever been a part of.”
Fifteen games—and 11 wins—later, it’s safe to say the team had the will. Lehrer’s offensive system, which the team struggled to implement during last year, when it didn’t manage more than two goals in any single game, is clicking on all cylinders. Harvard scored three goals in five straight September wins; you have to go back to 2009 to just find the last time it was able to do so in consecutive contests.
That 2009 team, which won 14 straight games and started off its season with six straight wins, is the historical benchmark for this year’s squad. That team, like Lehrer’s second, opened its Ivy League season with an early 1-0 October win over Yale. That season ended with the team’s fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance and a place in the third round of the NCAA Tournament.
Those late-2000s teams are eerily reminiscent of the program Lehrer aspires to be—the Harvard men’s basketball program. That Crimson last year clinched its fourth straight Ivy League title before falling in—guess it—the NCAA Tournament third round.
Right now, the team has some work to do to live up to its peers in Lavietes Pavilion. With a chance to close out the Ivy League last year on its home field, the team battled but fell short, 2-0, against Penn. While Amaker’s squad enters the season seeking its fifth championship ring, Lehrer’s team looks for its first.
The team’s championship attitude bodes well for its ability to accomplish Lehrer’s goals.
This is a squad which openly admitted its ultimate goal is not a league title, but a national one, a squad whose coach noted before the season that “we feel we can compete with anyone nationally” and whose co-captain stated that “[there] is more of an expectation that we will be great.”
This is one-half of the odd duality that has kept the team successful under Lehrer: although the squad has never been short on confidence or quiet about its bigger goals, it never looks past the opponent in front of it. Lehrer is fond of noting that “our biggest game is our next game,” preaching that his players bring laser-sharp focus to every area of their lives.
Cornell, which fell from first in the league in 2012 to a paltry sixth last year, is only the next item in the buffet for a hungry Crimson squad. With co-captain Kyle Henderson back to head the midfield and junior co-captain Mark Ashby heading up animproving back line, the pieces are fallinginto place for a serious run at the league title.
Indeed, with six games separating the Crimson from its first title since 2009, there is no denying the cultural change in the program.
The change begins with Lehrer, who, like Amaker, took a program in disarray and set his team’s mind on the ultimate goal.
Now comes the harder part: following through on its mission.
