After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kanye. Ye. Yeezy. Yeezus. Yandhi. West has a chameleonic capacity for reinventing himself. The analogy falls short, however, because Kanye never, ever, with any persona, blends in. Glorified as a creative genius by his supporters (a laurel he, too, has granted himself) and vilified as a firebrand by the doubters, Kanye West is no stranger to subversion.
Alongside his reputation for discord, another note has always rung true with Kanye: his spirituality. So, on Easter morning of Coachella’s second weekend, Kanye performed his Sunday Service concert, a two-hour-long spectacle of religious worship complete with music, dancing, and “Church Clothes” merchandise. Yeaster Sunday was an undeniably stunning display of the power of communal art-making –– and Kanye was the mastermind behind it.
For months now, we’ve seen Kanye’s intimate Sunday Service held in Calabasas, courtesy of the Kardashians’ Instagram stories. The sessions serve both religious and artistic purposes. Featuring a robust choir dressed all in white, dancers, and soloists (North West has even hopped on the mic), the outdoor performances have blended hip-hop and gospel, proving that the two arts are kindred spirits –– and, for that matter, spiritual kindred. Both can be said to be part of the long tradition of the spiritual, a musical genre originated by African Americans.
In the desert of Coachella Valley, with the mountains bearing witness, Kanye’s Sunday Service was the picture of a religious awakening. He and his immense group of performer-congregants assembled on a grassy hill custom-built for the spectacle. Clad in a loose-fitting array of muted purple and mauve hues –– Yeezy’s signature neutral palette –– the choir beamed out gospel numbers and a ring of dancers diffused energy throughout the stage space and, at one point, trickled into the VIP audience section. Soloist Teyana Taylor sang “Never Would Have Made It,” while Chance the Rapper, a devotee of gospel and hip-hop crossover, performed his verse from “Ultralight Beam.” DMX made an appearance, joining in with a stirring homily.
While Kanye was not the focus of the performance, he did rap excerpts of “All Falls Down” and “Jesus Walks,” the latter serving as a fitting grand finale. The service was live-streamed with a maddening peephole camera –– perhaps Kanye’s nod to the public’s constant peering into his life and highly publicized mental health issues. Kanye could be seen kneeling in prayer, his marbled pink hair on full display, and, toward the end of the performance, becoming overwhelmed with emotion. Kid Cudi was there, along with Chance and DMX, providing Kanye comfort.
Say what you will about Kanye West. About the $225 church merch sold at Yeaster Sunday. (What concert doesn’t sell merchandise?) An artist that defies containment, Kanye brought together a group of talented performers and unleashed the magic of a collective musical experience. Sunday Service seemed to be a moment of redemption for Kanye West –– one he ought not be denied.

ABC’s new comedy, “Bless This Mess,” follows newlyweds Mike and Rio as they forgo the hustle and bustle of their New York City lives in favor of greener pastures. Their hasty move to Nebraska provides some good comedic fodder, playing on the trope of the “country bumpkin” and poking fun at city-slicker stereotypes. It is too early to tell whether these structures will hold the show up to snuff or not, but one thing is certain: the strong ensemble has the potential for comedic gold –– or, at least silver.
Co-creator Lake Bell stars as Rio, an enthusiastic, Type-A therapist with an overbearing mother. Dax Shepard brings his signature lovable obnoxiousness to the role of Mike, a music journalist who has inherited his great aunt’s Nebraska farm and thinks himself a country boy at heart. The couple quit their jobs and make the cross-country journey to become small-time alfalfa farmers, only to realize that the picturesque farmhouse is in shambles and the soil is dead.
With 20-odd minutes to establish the conflict and incorporate some basic character development, the pilot episode of a network sitcom can only cover so much ground. “Bless This Mess” delivers admirably, devoting time to fleshing out seriously funny supporting characters. Pam Grier is wonderful as Constance, the owner of the local hardware store who doubles as sheriff and runs the town theatre. She shares a mildly hilarious moment of sexual tension with Ed Begley Jr.’s Rudy, an eccentric old friend of Mike’s family who shacks up in the barn and makes the occasional trip to the toilet inside the house.
Then, there is the neighbor couple, the Bowmans. Successful farmers themselves, they offer to buy the farmhouse off of Mike and Rio in order to convert it into a meat locker. David Koechner is quite funny as the brazen man’s man, Beau Bowman. He cuts a swaggering, cowboy-hatted figure reminiscent of his role as Champ Kind in the “Anchorman” series. The Bowmans’ offer presents a tantalizing way out for Mike and Rio, who decide, after their first disastrous day on the farm, to stick it out together. Their half-hipster, half-yuppie naivete is teased ruthlessly. Some fun is had on behalf of the rustic characters’ strange folk wisdom, however, like their preternatural knowledge that “a storm is a-comin’.”
The pilot traffics heavily in comedic tropes: Mike and Rio enter the farmhouse jubilantly and the floorboards go out beneath their feet, Rio goes head-to-head with a harmless cow to confront a childhood trauma involving a petting zoo, and Rudy walks in on the couple while they are in the shower together –– Mike, of course, wields a bar of soap as his weapon against the intruder. These riffs on existing comedic devices might be forgiven, however, because the show does not claim to be especially clever. To be fair, there are a few strong one-liners delivered with great timing, like Rio’s declaration that she will indeed not be letting go of her precious screen time: “I’m not unplugged and I have no intention of unplugging!” All things considered, “Bless This Mess” is genre-conscious in the extreme, which could very well lead to some fantastic dry humour.

As the flames of Khal Drogo’s funeral pyre petered out and the first season of “Game of Thrones” ended with shrieks of creatures long forgotten, television screens across the country should have met with another sound: exasperated groaning. Even then, it was clear that the show’s dragons would become insufferable. Sure enough, seven seasons later, the winged lizards have all but morphed into reptilian albatrosses around the necks of the characters who possess them.
For beings of sweat and sinew, the beasts are disappointingly robotic on the show. It’s clear that they’re barely-fleshed-out plot devices — and inconsistent ones at that. They’re petulant until the protagonists can no longer afford them to be, loyal until the fraught situation no longer demands it. They’re able to bring down the mystical House of the Undying as fledglings while falling victim to well-placed icicles at maturity. The dragons are a reminder that in fantastic worlds, deus ex machina can only reasonably be matched with more deus ex machina, which is a fair claim considering they are little more than convenient flamethrowers outfitted in plot armor.
Most frustrating is the fact that the dragons deliberately bulldoze what might otherwise constitute compelling character development. Borne of decorative royal wedding gifts, the once-fossils are unmistakable emblems of the tired trope that is pedigree. They are attention-sinks, distracting from Daenerys’s actual charisma and magnanimity and catering to the worst impulses of both the Targaryen bloodline and bread-and-circuses audience. Both in Essos and Westeros, they are untenable and unwanted, a personification of the urge to pillory rather than put down roots. Some speak of riding tigers, but riding dragons is no different: To lean on these reptiles means fully embracing the draconian. In the main characters’ case, it is not simply for the worse. It is also boring.
Yes, the dragons are CGI masterpieces and easy rallying points for fans of the show. But like the promotional materials that the “Game of Thrones” marketing team are so fond of creating, the newer seasons are left in the shadow of these unwieldy beings. “Game of Thrones” succeeds at high fantasy because it reveals that, like the fabled creatures’ families paint onto their sigils, people’s aspirations can be devastatingly lofty and destructive. One does not need literal dragons to prove that.

Howard Merlin, the Costume Shop and Footwear Coordinator for the Boston Ballet, painted over 700 pairs of shoes last season. For any given Boston Ballet show, he and his colleagues create upwards of 250 costumes. In total, the Ballet is responsible for over 1,000 articles of clothing each year. Every dancer that crosses the Boston Ballet’s stage must wear a custom outfit — and every single one of those outfits must be both practical and striking. They should catch the audience members’ eyes while remaining absolutely unobtrusive. They should mesh form and function so flawlessly that viewers barely notice them.
In other words, costumes must let performers showcase their artistry — and, according to Boston’s costume workers, the clothing must also be artwork itself.
“In costuming, we are linear creatives that must combine executive function with an aesthetic overview,” Boston Ballet Draper Lisa Dezmelyk explained in an email to The Crimson. “And it helps to have talent.”
For most ballet and theater companies, the creation of these costumes requires a deep pool of professional expertise. Often, a director oversees the costuming process and a designer draws up the patterns. Drapers, stitchers, painters, and dyers work together to craft the actual clothing. Sometimes, a person titled “First Hand” will help the designer, or a Wardrobe Supervisor will assist with running the show. Often there will be a staff member devoted to wigs or to shoes.
Carolyn Hoffmann-Schneider, the Costume Director for the Huntington Theatre Company, said that her job description is fluid and “all-encompassing.”
“I talk with the designers and then with my team of drapers and stitchers and crafts artisans to create what the designer wants,” she said. “And then together, we work together to get all the objects physically in the building for the performers.”
Although Dezmelyk holds a different position than Hoffmann-Schneider — Dezmelyk is a draper — she, too, finds variety and flexibility in her work.
“I describe my job as a combination of being an artist, artisan, sculptor, engineer, fitter, pattern maker, seamstress, mentor (to my crew and shop interns), and a project manager,” she wrote.
Variety aside, Hoffmann-Schneider and Dezmelyk both said that the core of their job — the point of making costumes — is to evoke a scene or image for their viewers. When asked whether their job involved creativity, both immediately said that it did. “Costuming” may involve a lot of different tasks — but according to Hoffmann-Schneider and Dezmelyk, the end goal is always to generate emotion within the audience.
“I like the idea of clothing being an art form,” Hoffmann-Schneider said. “With costumes, you tell us a little bit more of a story. You get more characters and background, and you can be more specific with what you're trying to say.”
Both Hoffmann-Schneider and Dezmelyk come from backgrounds in the fashion industry. Hoffmann-Schneider received her undergraduate degree in fashion; Dezmelyk originally thought she would go into fashion design, but she eventually became interested in “creating a character and telling a story through clothes.”
“They both take a lot of problem solving, and they’re both very creative,” Hoffmann-Schneider said of costuming and the traditional fashion industry. “It’s just a slightly different mindset in each.”
Hoffmann-Schneider also spoke to the functional elements that make theater costuming unique. Both fashion and costumes use clothing to evoke an aesthetic, she said. Only costumes, however, have to accommodate heavy daily use, a high mobility requirement, and rapid outfit changes. Hoffmann-Schneider is currently working on a show that involves sand and rain — and so the shoes are treated with a special rubber and the clothes are doused with chlorine, all while maintaining historical accuracy and aesthetic glitz.
According to Dezmelyk and Howard Merlin, ballet comes with even more stringent costuming restrictions. “Dancers have a much wider range of movement,” Dezmelyk wrote, “and additional hidden stretch panels are often needed.”
Merlin works primarily with ballet shoes, a costume element for which function is especially important. Merlin himself began as a dancer with the Boston Ballet, and he transitioned into the costume shop to stay close to the dance world. Merlin said that he remembers how important shoes were to him as a dancer — and that in his current position, he works to make performers as comfortable as possible.
“Since I am responsible for dyeing all shoes for each show, I get to work with the designs and or designers to make sure the dancers feet match ones outfit,” he wrote in an email. “Being a former dancer, your feet and what’s on them are most important.”
Despite all of costuming’s challenges, however, the costume workers all agreed that the results are worth the effort. When the Boston Ballet is able to showcase the entire career of choreographer William Forsythe as it did in March, or when the Huntington Theatre Company can bring Sherlock Holmes back to life like it did last October, then the costumers’ designs are doing their jobs.
“It can be stimulating, exhausting, frustrating, exciting, rewarding, stressful, gorgeous, bold, subtle, surprising, educational, or meditative. Every time the curtain goes up it is a thrill to see our work on stage,” Dezmelyk wrote of her work. “And it is never, ever boring!”

Olivia Wilde had never directed before “Booksmart.” Yet she was able to shoot the film in just 26 days. “Preparation is everything," she said. “You should know [your film] so well that you can allow for things to evolve and change.”
In “Booksmart,” two overachieving high school seniors Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (Beanie Feldstein) question their decision to focus solely on grades, since their peers who were admitted into the same elite colleges managed to do so without trying as hard. On the eve of their graduation, the girls try to cram four years of partying and rule-breaking into one night. Wilde, Feldstein, Dever, and screenwriter Katherine Silberman sat down in the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Boston for a roundtable interview with The Harvard Crimson about their film, which comes out May 24.
Despite the quick production turnaround, Wilde and her team were confident that they’d be able to make it work.
“[Filmmaking] is like a chemical equation,” Silberman said. “You have to know the rules before you break the rules — because [Wilde] so clearly knew what everything was going to be, it created freedom to try new things.”
Evolution was a theme that resonated both on and off screen: The crew remained flexible and open to change behind the camera, and the film itself challenges audiences to let their views on others evolve beyond their limited perceptions.
“We're all guilty of judging people,” Wilde said. “As an adolescent, I certainly decided ‘that person must be mean’ or ‘that person has it out for me’ just to organize society in a way that made sense. Everyone is complicated, everyone is dealing with pain, and it's probably not about you.”
“And that’s real wisdom,” Silberman added. “As opposed to being booksmart, this is knowledge you can only get from experience.”
With “Booksmart,” Wilde explores the nearly universal bumbling awkwardness that defines much of the high school experience and crafts a narrative that can resonate with young people today.
“One of my favorite scenes of the film is the scene where Amy is having her first sexual experience,” Feldstein said. “She’s trying to get [her partner’s] Converses off — everyone wears Converses, they’re hard to get off, and all those little moments capture that nervousness and excitement and awkwardness.” Dever noted how the film “beautifully represents the generation that we’re living in.”
And this goal of accurately representing the teenagers of today propelled “Booksmart” into existence; Wilde hoped to create a “generational anthem” with this feature.
“I knew I wanted to do a movie. I was really inspired by movies like ‘The Breakfast Club,’ ‘Dazed and Confused,’ and ‘Clueless’... It had always been a dream for me. I was always wondering, ‘Where’s my Breakfast Club?’ I then read an original draft of ‘Booksmart’ and thought, ‘Oh, it's in here. It's inside this story, but it needs to be updated to fit this generation, to honor this generation and how evolved it is,’” she said.
In making these updates, Silberman considered questions like, “What is the movie that I want to see?” and “What is the movie that I haven’t seen yet?” She said, “The movies that we think about that made us want to make movies — you want to make that. Trying to make something that would be your favorite movie when you were in high school is the bar to set because that’s when it becomes authentic, real, and meaningful.”
Feldstein felt the weight and responsibility of headlining this nuanced story and starring in such a complex role.
“My character didn’t come very easily to me,” she said. I felt very intimidated by her. I had been used to playing supporting characters who come in and are ‘the joke.’ I was intimidated to be on this two person journey where [Kaitlyn and I] are the story.”
“It was really nice to have Beanie’s hand to hold throughout the whole process,” Dever said. “We had never led a film before, so it was amazing having a best friend to go through this scary thing with.”
The four women sought to create a film that explored the stressful but life-changing test of patience that is high school, and, in the process, had a stressful but life-changing experience themselves.
“I definitely want to direct again soon, it was the best experience of life,” Wilde said. I’m really excited to jump on another project with [Silberman]. We’re creating something else right now which is another female two-hander, which we’re very excited about.”
“The bar has been set so high working with these three,” Silberman said. “It’s both exciting and kind of devastating to realize how high.”

Vintage has always been popular, but fashion resale has recently reached new heights. According to the 2019 Resale Report compiled by thredUP, an online thrift store, the secondhand clothing market is expected to double within the next five years — and to become 1.5 times the size of fast fashion within the next 10. In other words, cheap basics from Forever 21 are out; one-of-a-kind, eco-friendly apparel is in.
Explanations for this shift to thrift abound. Some say Marie Kondo has something to do with it: thredUP reported that donations increased by 80 percent after Netflix released “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo.” News outlets have picked up on the influence of this “celebrity of tidying,” such as CNN, which released an article in January headlined, “Netflix has people (serenely) bulldozing their closets, and thrift stores are riding the wave.” Kondo’s “KonMari” method urges people to discard everything that does not bring joy.
Pop culture aside, an increased awareness of fashion’s economic footprint could also account for the increased popularity in resale. By 2050, textile production will account for 25 percent of all carbon emissions. Secondhand clothing represents a movement toward fashion recycling, with the purchase of one used item reducing its carbon footprint by 82 percent. Moreover, thredUP’s report shows that consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious: 72 percent of consumers prefer to buy from eco-friendly brands, and 90 percent of retail execs want to join the resale movement by 2020.
But in Cambridge, thrift shop employees aren’t noticing anything different. Boasting their unwavering popularity among all demographics (but college students in particular), employees of The Garment District, Boomerangs, and Goodwill are enjoying flourishing business in this university town that has long branded secondhand as fashionable.
Binky Rice has been a sales associate at The Garment District since 2010 and said that it has been a popular destination for as long as he has known it.
“Years ago when this store opened, there was hardly anything in Kendall Square. But the population has changed, and now people come in on their lunch break,” he said. The site is especially busy during the academic year, with college orientation groups and theater programs bringing in flocks of shoppers, in addition to the usual foot traffic.
And for good reason: The Garment District offers perhaps the most eclectic selection of secondhand fashion. Sections include ‘80s and ‘90s Sweaters, Vests, Blazers, Dresses, and Denim Jackets; ‘60s and ‘70s of the same; Handbags; Petticoats & Tutus; Capes & Ponchos; Shoes — and one section is simply called “Sparkle.”
By virtue of this enormous selection, Rice said that the “superstore” was incomparable to other thrift shops in the area. While most occupy an average-sized storefront, The Garment District (with three parts: the main thrift shop, Boston Costume, and By The Pound) takes up the whole building. Its website calls it an “alternative department store” — and Rice reported that prices are, on average, around three times less than department store prices.
“We’re a shark. It’s just massive,” he said proudly, adding that turnover is “amazing.” He planned on purchasing a Miley Cyrus rock tee later, before someone else snatched it up.
Although Boomerangs in Central Square is smaller, its selection is hardly less impressive. Aside from clothing (women’s, men’s, and a small children’s section), the store also offers secondhand furniture, decor, and media. In decor, one can find Christmas and Halloween decorations as well as a drinkware selection. In media, one woman excitedly picked up the entire BBC “Pride and Prejudice” series on VCR.
Sales Associate Danielle Pino’s favorite section of Boomerangs is the “hard goods” section, which occupies the wall behind the cash register and sometimes includes antiques. She said that the store also stands out for its donations to the AIDS Action Committee of Massachusetts. With locations in Jamaica Plain, West Roxbury, South End, and Central Square, the store collects significant sums to donate.
“There are always passionate people who love finding great deals who come in,” Pino said, attesting, again, to the unchanging thrifting habits of Cambridge residents. She has worked at Boomerangs for four and a half years and reported that the store is never quiet.
Located just across the street, Goodwill is a tried and true option for local thrifters, too. Jayden Lewis, who works at Goodwill, said that it offers more brand-new options than do other thrift shops in the area.
“I feel like we get a lot of brand name clothes like North Face, Columbia, brand-new shoes too, and the store really stays busy a lot,” Lewis said, adding that sometimes these jackets would be priced at around $15 to $20, while their original price tags would read $80 or more. For this reason, Lewis’s favorite section is the boutique area. In addition to people dropping off clothing at the store, Goodwill also receives daily shipments of donations.
Altogether, with the vast turnover — both of donations and purchases — thrift shops in Cambridge cannot be expected to have an item in stock for more than several days. Rice noted this phenomenon, saying that if you have your eye on something, you just need to buy it.
In reference to media reports of the recent upsurge, Pino said, “I’m not sure if thrifting has become more or less popular. We’re always busy. You can always find amazing, random things here, and new things are being put out every day.”

Netflix is freshening up for spring with an array of new and old films available to stream beginning May 1. In theme and content, these flicks run the gamut. Here is a list of some notable May flowers springing up on Netflix this month.
Netflix Original Films:
“Knock Down the House” (May 1)
On the first of the month, Netflix will raise the curtain on its new documentary following the 2018 congressional campaigns of four female progressives, including Senator Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “Knock Down the House” premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January to critical acclaim, winning a Festival Favorite award. Director Rachel Lears, who doubled as cinematographer, raised $28,111 for the film through Kickstarter. After its Sundance success, Netflix bought the distribution rights for $10 million. In addition to Sen. Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress, the film tracks the trajectories of grassroots politicians Cori Bush of Missouri, Paula Jean Swearengin of West Virginia, and Amy Vilela of Nevada. Above all, it promises an intimate look at Sen. Ocasio-Cortez’ campaign for the 2018 Democratic Primary election for New York’s 14th district, in which she defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley –– a victory considered to be the biggest upset in the 2018 primaries. Lears began filming Ocasio-Cortez in March 2017, capturing both the trailblazing senator’s experiences in her day job as a bartender and the moment she decided to run for Congress.
“Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” (May 3)
The streaming giant’s perennial offerings of true crime stories bloom once again with this Ted Bundy biopic. “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” is directed by Joe Berlinger, who is something of a Bundy enthusiast: He also produced the docuseries, “Conversations With a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes,” which featured archival interviews with Bundy on death row and hit Netflix in January. In a stunning departure from his usual roles as the romantic lead, Zac Efron stars as the most notorious serial killer in the United States, and he’s already getting Oscar buzz for his portrayal. But the real meat of this film? It’s told through the perspective of Bundy’s longtime girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer, played by Golden Globe-nominated actress Lily Collins. Kleopfer, who goes by Elizabeth Kendall, is credited as a co-writer for the film, which is based on her 1981 memoir, “The Phantom Prince: My Life with Ted Bundy.” Talk about an unhealthy relationship.
“Wine Country” (May 10)
Let’s all pour one out for funny woman Amy Poehler’s feature film directorial debut, because what’s better than a trip to Napa Valley with Poehler and her fellow “Saturday Night Live” alumnae? Featuring Tina Fey, Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, and Paula Pell, “Wine Country” was inspired by a wild weekend Poehler and friends shared. As if a peek into the all-star friend group’s real-life getaways isn’t incentive enough, the film also boasts some hefty writing talent. Former SNL writers Liz Cackowski and Emily Spivey (who also star in the film) are credited as co-writers. “Wine Country” follows the loving girl group for a 50th birthday trip to Napa, where the wine flows, the past crops up, and tensions boil over. In vino veritas, indeed.
And a Sci-Fi Classic: 
The Matrix Trilogy (May 1)
Believe it or not, it’s been 20 years since the Wachowskis revolutionized cinema with their sci-fi mind-bender, “The Matrix” –– 20 years since they brought the “bullet time” effect to action filmmaking and “red pill or blue pill” to the popular vernacular. To commemorate the franchise’s birth year, Netflix is showing up to the party with “The Matrix” (1999) and its sequels, “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions” (2003). The film catapulted Keanu Reeves to international celebrity with his role as Neo (a.k.a. “the One”), an average Joe computer hacker that has the audacity to ask, “What is the Matrix?” Joined by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo goes to war with the sentient machines who have trapped humanity inside a complex virtual reality system. Who can forget those shiny PVC get-ups, Hugo Weaving’s self-multiplication as Agent Smith, or that green rain of computer code? From simulation theory to John Woo-inspired martial arts, “The Matrix” set the tone for the 21st century’s A.I. anxiety. Go on. Follow the white rabbit.

Imagine a totalitarian government preoccupied with regulating the content of dreams — perhaps in the sense of those hallucinatory landscapes we encounter in our sleep, but more importantly, what we are capable of envisioning in the future: our hopes. What if our dreams were subject to censorship? In Ma Jian’s “China Dream,” Ma Daode is tasked with the mission to eliminate rogue dreams that do not align with the officially sanctioned national China Dream. Gleeful with his high-ranking position as director of the China Dream Bureau and the accompanying opulence and fame, Director Ma seems the epitome of political success. In the ultimate irony, Ma Daode, whose name signifies uprightness (Dao) and virtue (De), spends his days taking bribes and mistresses. Ma Jian’s work, part of a long lineage of politically dissident fiction that precipitated his exile from China, is a caustic and brilliant criticism of China’s current authoritarian regime.
Exaggerated to the point of becoming farcical, Ma Daode’s character is one of virulent corruption and the most terrible kind of self-interest. Yet, there is something particularly tragic in his downfall. More and more, Ma Daode finds his mind involuntarily dredging up violent and insistent vestiges of his past. Flashbacks of his time as a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution and the atrocities committed both by and upon him threaten to throw his entire life off balance. Ma Daode’s success comes at a price: constant scrutiny. One misplaced word or one careless expression could place his party loyalty under suspicion, with proportional punishment administered. So Ma Daode’s nightmares and flashbacks must be eliminated immediately, or risk a public slip that could topple his life.
Seeking both a science fictional remedy in the form of a brainwashing, nightmare-overriding brain chip and a mythological remedy in Grandma Meng’s soup of forgetfulness, Ma Daode grows increasingly desperate to erase his own memories of the past. And yet, he, with proportionate desperation, clings to specific memories. With paranoiac intensity, Ma Daode becomes obsessed with the prospect of selectively eradicating painful memories. With dark humor, Ma Jian notes that “If life becomes disconnected from the past it loses all meaning.” Ma Daode’s drive to erase past crimes is a blatant allegory for the current Chinese regime’s idolization of Chairman Mao and glorification of the political transition to communism.
“China Dream” is filled with sex and murder. Gorily pornographic and viscerally, graphically violent, Ma Jian’s novel is both tragic and intensely comic. Reading this novel is extremely unsettling: The unapologetic vulgarity, extreme eroticism, and deep irreverence of “China Dream” leave readers at the midpoint between laughing and choking.
Particularly disorienting is the manner in which Ma Daode’s past begins to bleed into his present. Flashbacks escalate until Ma Daode begins to experience time simultaneously. Past victims mingle with living people, not as ghosts returning to haunt Director Ma, but as fully fleshed traces of the past that have come to walk again in Ma Daode’s present. As Ma Jian writes, “The past and the present form a tangled web from which it becomes impossible to break free.” Embedded in this narrative construction is a call for a historical reckoning. China today is continuously haunted by its government’s histories of violence, just as Ma Daode is, Ma Jian seems to suggest. It is easy to see the reason for Ma Jian’s exile. There is something penetratingly dissident in Ma Jian’s novel. A brutal interrogation of China’s current regime takes place within the pages of “China Dream.”
Though living in exile in London, Ma Jian refuses to be silenced by the Chinese government and continues to insistently and prolifically write — and still in his native Chinese. Though losing none of its clear genius, the English rendition of “China Dream” undoubtedly loses something in the process of translation. Clever uses of homophones and the perverse irony of certain references to the Odes and other Chinese classics in the text messages of Ma Daode’s mistresses, for example, are lost in the English version of the novel. Furthermore, due to the natural grammatical infrastructure of the Chinese language, the entirety of the novel is written — and therefore translated — in the present-indefinite. Though this is slightly strange at first, the atemporality of the text perhaps amplifies the macabre, haunting quality of “China Dream” — it is, as Ma Jian says, a coalescing of past and present, happening simultaneously.
A chilling dystopian novel, “China Dream” will leave you breathless and shaken. Ma Jian’s brilliance is astounding and reverberates with a sort of cryptic, jaded humor throughout the book with an almost physical insistence.

Mary Laura Philpott would likely fit in well at Harvard. After all, the first 30 pages of her new memoir, “I Miss You When I Blink,” detail her neuroses about wanting everything to be perfect, her insatiable desire and quest for success, and a crippling worry that she’s not doing enough or wanting the right things. But forget about the negative aspects of those stereotypes for a moment, and Philpott is able to accurately portray the traits and anxieties of people like the average Harvard student who runs on the guinea pig wheel without realizing that the race will never end. Unless, of course, they jump off and discover what it is, exactly, they’re doing or why they’re running in the first place. Philpott’s essays explore interactions with her children, her paralyzing fear of what to do after college (English concentrators, unite!), how to cope with getting that star-studded job but then feeling unfulfilled and empty, and the difficult yet worthy beauties of falling in love. She unpacks a lot, with varying degrees of success.
Like most essays a college student will write over the course of four years, some of Philpott’s are really good and some are just...not. This is to be expected, given that some ideas are much more difficult to express than others — like the inescapable feeling of not having done enough even after having checked every single box that leads to the completed checklist of “success.” Some essays end with no seeming resolution, while others are wrapped up in so neat a proverbial bow that one wonders how many times it took Philpott to craft that on-the-nose sentence.
Philpott’s essays are distributed along a bell curve[, meaning that (bear with me for a moment with this analogy): The early ones are not excellent, the middle ones are, and the ones at the end are also lackluster. Collectively, the balance makes her collection of essays worth reading, even if the reader is sometimes left wondering, “So what?” from the author, and even if some topics are poorly tackled.
An early essay, titled “The Perfect Murder Weapon,” relies predominantly on telling the reader everything. Indeed, one of the sentences even says “My name is Mary Laura Philpott, and I am addicted to getting things right.” It’s an indirect thesis and the clarity is refreshing, but the rest of the chapter proceeds to tell the reader how, when, and why Philpott likes things to be perfect. One learns a lot about her neuroses but in a way that is precisely what ninth-grade English teachers say not to do: She tells instead of shows. A few pages of that make for repetitive reading.
Three essays in quick succession stand out among the rest: “P-O-I-S-O-N,” “Good Job,” and “This Guy.” The first details the problematic bad boy that Philpott dated in college — a boy who was clearly alluring but who, according to Philpott, “was totally wrong but really fun for a little while.” He very clearly came and went as he pleased with very little regard for her feelings, leaving her to sit by the phone waiting for him to call and do a great deal of emotional labor within the relationship. We know this because Philpott told a story in this chapter, making it far more effective than her earlier ones, and, because of the extended anecdote, teaches the reader a lesson about the line between wanting to make a relationship work and doing all the heavy lifting alone.
“Good Job” is predictably about her first job, and opens with a funny exchange between her and a friend: In reference to a Roomba, the friend says, “It’s like a drunk bee,” to which Philpott replies, “Or us in our twenties.” It’s moments like these when one wishes she dropped more one-liners like this throughout her prose — she has the capacity to do it, but chooses to ruminate more often than not. This chapter is indeed full of one-liners. A couple pages later, on the subject of success, Philpott writes “What if work is just a thing we do to distract ourselves from the fact that the world is falling apart? In that case, it doesn’t even matter what job you do or how well you do it.” Harvard students: This is food for thought.
“This Guy” describes how she met her husband, and the inevitable conclusions about love that a happily married person can draw — cheesy perhaps, but arguably true. She writes that “the evolution of a relationship is not something you can entirely control. Falling in love is not a matter of weighing pros and cons. Unlike other big life events — jobs, moves, homes — it’s not a thing you work toward like you’re seeking a personal-life promotion.” Again: food for thought.
Yet the chapters towards the end of the novel miss the mark. They jump from one topic to another within the same essay, which is jarring because the essays themselves are short enough that focus and unity is not only necessary, but doable. Each one should be a microcosm of some larger theme and rumination, and to string together disjointed thoughts and anecdotes without any sense of unification makes for difficult reading.
Philpott’s memoir is somewhat baffling in the range of quality from essay to essay: Theoretically, the same editor read them all, right? Collectively, they are unified under the broader theme of questioning and desiring success in all its various iterations — and the price to be paid for each one. Worth the read, but a shame that enough of the essays read as though they could have used at least one more draft.

The third episode of “Game of Thrones”s final season had to include the long-awaited battle between the Night King and the North. Shockingly, however, the episode included virtually nothing else. Characters fought for their lives and there were a handful of heart-stopping scenes, but contrary to typical “GOT” fashion, there were far fewer major deaths than expected. While there were many visually pleasing battle scenes, much of the fighting occurred in darkness, making it difficult to differentiate between the deaths of extras from the deaths of fan favorites. Ultimately, the episode’s epic conclusion wins it a seat among the show's best episodes, but the lack of dialogue (and on-screen death) answered none of the most important questions.
When there was enough light to see the fighting, the graphics were absolutely astonishing. Fans were finally given the dragon fight they had been waiting for, and it was everything they could’ve wish for. Teeth hit scales as the dragons intertwined, leaving their riders (and viewers) breathless. Lyanna Mormont slays a giant White Walker as her final act, and there was something so powerful watching such a small girl kill such a large foe. The dead themselves are a graphic masterpiece: more terrifying and calculated than the lumbering creatures of “The Walking Dead” and less hoaky than the goofy depictions in “Santa Clarita Diet.” 
But the darkness ultimately prevailed, rendering much of the fighting lackluster. Because there were so few important character deaths, the writers were forced to show countless deaths of random extras. Unfortunately, because it was so dark, it was often hard to distinguish between extras and well-loved characters. If this was done on purpose to build suspense, it failed. After awhile it was clear that the too-dark scenes were less important and therefore deserved less attention.
Overall, the scenes of this episode can be neatly categorized either as “epic” or “underwhelming,” with very little in between. The underwhelming scenes are obscured in darkness, but each major death is given it’s due diligence: Theon is given a chance to ultimately redeem himself, Dondarrion poses Christ-like protecting Arya, Lyanna makes a final stand, and Ser Jorah protects his queen until his last breath. And in the end — in a jaw-dropping last minute attempt — they win.
So now the Night King is vanquished and fans are supposed to turn their attention to King’s Landing. And while it is nice to return to the witty dialogue and political intrigue that focuses on the Iron Throne, the Night King plot deserves more. For one, the cost of the battle doesn’t feel high enough (after all, Brienee, Gilly, Tormund, and Podrick were all commonly assumed to be goners). For another, the scarcity of dialogue leaves so many questions about the Night King (and Bran) unanswered: Why, exactly, is the Night King here? What does he want? Why does he dislike Bran above all? And why did Bran, in the heat of battle, turn to Theon and say, “I’m going to go now,” before slipping into a trance?
The fight against the dead is something that the series has been building up to for years now, but now that it’s all over the audience still knows relatively little about their purpose and their history. Furthermore, Bran’s role in everything is quite unclear. The final three episodes still have time to deliver fans a satisfying answer to their questions, but it will be a shame if the next four hours fail to fill in the gaps of our White Walker knowledge.
“Game of Thrones” writers craft some of the best one-liners, and most characters wield these words better than armor. Now that the show has delivered a battle of epic proportions, dragon fight scene and all, it’s time to move on to what the show does best: political intrigue.

New York, Milan, and Paris are known as fashion centers of the world, but what about Boston? What fashion would Boston even be known for? Stroll around Boston Common, and you’ll see Red Sox and Celtics jerseys. Salmon-colored shorts and pastel linen make an appearance on the various university and prep school campuses around New England, but sweatpants and college apparel may be even more popular nowadays. There may not be an obvious, discernible Boston “look,” the same way a beret, a turtleneck, and a cigarette may identify someone as a resident of the City of Lights, but Boston still boasts a vibrant fashion scene.
Boston Fashion Week, which showcases the work of Boston’s fashion talent, has been around since 1995. Fashion author Jay Calderin founded BFW as a way to uplift local designers, whether they were burgeoning artists looking to break into the fashion world or experienced industry professionals. A variety of events, from fashion shows to exhibits to educational programs to parties, allows local talent to make connections with one another, as well as reach a public audience with their work. Boston Fashion Week prides itself in its accessibility and diversity with regard to the opportunities it offers to those interested in fashion, in any capacity, around the greater Boston area. This year’s Boston Fashion Week will take place Sept. 22 through 28.
One way Boston Fashion Week reinvents the conception of what a fashion show can be with their annual “Open Runway” event. Inspired by the format of an open mic night, where anyone can get onstage and sing, play music, or perform stand-up comedy, the Open Runway gives amateur designers and models the opportunity to showcase their work and strut down the catwalk. The fashion industry is generally known for its exclusivity. Getting into the business often requires knowing the right people and coming from a privileged background. Aspiring models, especially, are limited by how much they weigh, how tall they are, and often their ethnicity. What the Open Runway offers is a chance for anyone, no matter who they are, to share their work with a warm and passionate audience of like-minded fashion enthusiasts. This year’s free, open-air fashion show will take place on The Steps, located in Downtown Crossing, on May 30.
Boston Fashion Week also upholds its ethos of accessibility by inviting any and every self-identified designer in the greater Boston area to participate in its programming. All designers need to do is fill out an online submission form in order to get their foot in the door. Once the event is approved, designers possess full control and responsibility over the organization of the event: They select models, stylists, hair and makeup artists, as well as whoever else they may want to be a part of their event. By granting creative control to the designers, Boston Fashion Week creates a bottom-up artistic community that allows the event to be artist-centric. One way it does this is by allowing students at nearby universities, like Lasell College and MassArt to host their own shows. It has a DIY-ethic absent from most of the fashion industry, where luxury brands like Hermès and Gucci maintain their exorbitantly inaccessible price points. This event maintains its status as a civic initiative by making everything about the people involved, as well as their art, rather than exclusion and narrow definitions of beauty, giving a definition to what Boston’s fashion scene really looks like.

With June fast approaching, it is hard to believe that 2019 is almost halfway over. This year will go down in history as the year of the Mueller Report, the Venezuelan presidential crisis, and the second North Korea-United States summit, along with a thousand other events that rocked and shaped its progress. Even among these events, the media still publish reports on Melania Trump wearing a jacket emblazoned “I Really Don’t Care, Do U?” to a migrant shelter or the price of Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez’s suits, suggesting that politics and fashion are not such strange bedfellows. The chaos of today makes it easier to turn back the clock — to rewind some 50 years to revisit the events that similarly transformed 1969 and its fashion, which wholeheartedly symbolized a changing era.
Charged with rebellion and anger, 1969 was marked by overwhelming turmoil. The year saw the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission, the inception of the internet, the first U.S. troops withdraw from Vietnam, the Sino-Soviet border conflict, Britain deploying troops to Northern Ireland, the Stonewall Riots, and the Andean Pact, to name a few events.
This spirit of revolution also applies itself artistically. The Beatles released “Abbey Road,” the cult film “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” dominated the box office, and Woodstock attracted half a million people with headliners like Janis Joplin and Jefferson Airplane. More than any other era, the ‘60s embodies the clear link between cultural and political events and the arts.
In the ‘60s, young people careless about the latest collections showing at Paris couture week — they found the convention elitist and antiquated in a new world order. Instead, they turned to designers like Mary Quant, who gave women clothes that already felt made for them: mini-skirts, knee socks, pinafore dresses, and short shift dresses. Women across the world wanted this “London boutique-style” look, and French designers like André Courrèges and Pierre Cardin followed suit.
An event like Woodstock encapsulates how the establishment’s rule — even those of the fashion establishment — can so easily be cast off. Woodstock saw the peak of hippie style: Ossie Clark’s long peasant dresses, Jimi Hendrix’s military jackets and fringe suede jackets, Emilio Pucci’s paisley prints, and Edwardian voluminous blouses. The festival inspired the mass appropriation of Native American, Asian (namely Indian), and West African designs in particular Indian print tunics, African dashikis, and Pakistani trousers. Larger fashion retailers like J.C. Penney took note and re-appropriated these designs for mass consumption.
A connection can also be drawn between the political climate and the world’s consumption at the time. Though the late ‘60s were a turbulent time fiscally, particularly for the U.S., experts now see a link between the rise in salaries among men and women and the shift in the way that people dressed during the time period. Higher salaries meant young people could afford more expensive, colorful, and decorative clothes.
Even amidst the world of Paris fashion, an internal revolution occured. By 1969, Yves Saint Laurent established his boutique Rive Gauche. It-girls like Betty Catroux, Loulou de Falaise, and Catherine Deneuve modeled his clothes. His famous “safari collection,” filled with low slung belts, knee high boots, and cotton khaki jackets, dominated the scene alongside his brightly coloured patchwork dresses. The former was a look inspired by the uniforms worn by the Afrika Korps, and began to show that globalization was well underway in fashion.
English singer Jane Birkin — with her baby white t-shirts, flared blue jeans, and straw baskets — also dominated 1969. Her top-of-the charts album with husband Serge Gainsbourg featured a simple cover of her face featuring her signature wispy bangs, long hair, doe-eyes, and long lashes, a look that helped usher in and prime the bell bottom craze of the ‘70s.
Compared to other decades, this era’s fashion seems to be less obviously linked to politics. One begins to wonder, given more historically striking years like 1969, is this even a relevant question? While it is easy to see parallels between the release of Robert Mueller’s 2019 election report and the completion of the Pentagon Papers, can the same be said of fashion?
The answer is far from simple. Recent collections by Maria Grazia Chiuri for Dior with slogan statements about “sisterhood” or Prabal Gurung’s 2017 “The Future is Female” finale are all clear nods to contemporary waves of feminism and female empowerment that are reverberating around our conversations. Yet will clothes like these ever have the same magnitude or symbolic liberation as the mini-skirt?
Coachella fashion, try as it may, will always be a far cry away from the summer of ‘69. More than anything, it feels like a false pageantry. But fashion does seem like it is on the right track.The emulation of other eras, which fashion magazines Vogue and Elle report on every season, signifies a desire to bring back earlier revolutions in an attempt to bring about political and cultural change. We can only hope that someday soon, fashion makes the same amount of noise as it did 50 years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Donning a chic grey blazer and a pair of white bedazzled cowboy boots on a cloudy Sunday afternoon, Nikole L. Naloy ’21 sports confidence, fun, and style. Earlier this year, she founded Fig., Harvard’s first fashion magazine. The inspiration for the name came from the use of “figures” in texts, journals, and writing — and, of course, her love of fresh figs.
The Harvard Crimson: What piqued your interest and got you involved in fashion in the first place?
Nikole Naloy: Let's say that I always liked dressing up. My birthday is around Halloween, so I always had a costume party. I would dress in something extravagant and over the top. In high school, I really started getting into just expressing myself through my outfits. It was a good way to build. I always liked to paint and create art and in that respect this was something that was daily and something that was like a constant work in progress. It’s really a phenomenal way of expressing myself.
And it has a lot to do with moods. I remember sometimes I would stroll in to high school and be in a terrible mood, and I knew my outfit could change how I was feeling and the goals that I was setting for myself. It’s always just been a lot of fun for me. In respect to finding pieces — or going into my mom's closet — my mom is a huge inspiration. Phenomenal style as well.
THC: How did you come up with Fig.?
NN: When I came to Harvard last year as a freshman, I kind of pushed my interest in fashion or any career goals in fashion aside. It's like, “Oh, I'm at such an academic institution, I should be thinking about more serious things.” And I even saw  a shift within my own personal style, as I was dressing down a little bit more, not playing around with as many items as I had been in high school. Coming into sophomore year, I said, “You know, there's something that keeps on itching.” It's like that desire to get back into reading about fashion, getting back into my crazy outfits. I'm bringing that back to campus. I found that a lot of the reasons why I wasn't into fashion my freshman year at Harvard was because I had no viable outlet.
So I said, “Why don’t I start my own thing?" I want to bring it here. Just talking with my friends about it, I found that there was a lot of interest. People were enthusiastic about the idea. My friends freshman year, the people I started connecting with my sophomore year, they all have a personal story related to the way they dress and their fashion. So I found that Harvard isn't Yale, it's not Brown, it's not “artsy” in that sense. But there are so many people that I was really fond of the way that they dress.
THC: For you, what is the relationship between fashion and art?
NN: I think that the clothing you wear on a daily basis is fundamentally a form of expressing yourself. To label it as art would be to define art, which I don't want to do. So I think it honestly depends on the person. For me, I take it as an art form. Like these cowboy boots are my art. They're like my fun, creative, over the top self, especially with the dazzle.
THC: You mentioned being interested in going into the fashion industry. Are you more interested in the design side or the editorial side, or in general?
NN: I would love to work in fashion. I have the Harvard education behind me and all these opportunities that Harvard bestows upon us. But it's very hard. I guess my internships after college will kind of determine it. I'm open to anything, and I love editorial. And Fig. has showed me how much fun it is, but also how much work it is — the incredible energy of producing a photoshoot, and then seeing it come to life. I'm so excited for the print issue to come out and to get to really hold it and see it that way. But I might even dabble in design sometime in the future.
THC: Do you see a lot of overlap of fashion within the VES and HAA departments here?
NN: I think the VES department has a more eclectic way of dressing. If you were just to do a visual survey, you'll find a little bit more eccentric outfits in the VES department. Just because I think artists are a little bit more conscious about what they're wearing. I think they try to image themselves a little bit differently. I think then again, fashion is not taken seriously within academia. It’s not frequent that you'll have someone who wants to enter the fashion industry and then commits to study in college — obviously you'll have that more at Fashion Institute of Technology or Parsons, but not at Harvard.
THC: You mentioned fashion not taken seriously in academia. Do you also think that fashion is not taken seriously as an art form?
NN: It definitely was not seen as an art form by any means earlier in time — if anything, it was advertising, especially in the ‘50s and ‘60s. I think now with conceptual and contemporary art there are so many more intersections. More contemporary artists are starting to work with fashion clothing as a medium. So I think that it is veering in that direction of being more appreciated. There’s still the commercial element of fashion though. Essentially, art is going to be sold but it's not necessarily made with the intention of being sold. The first thing that we might think in our creation of fashion is something like, if I'm making a shirt, I probably could sell it rather than display it in a gallery. So I think that tension still exists. But generally looking at the trends within Fashion Weeks, every show is its own art.

In one of @liljupiterr’s recent Instagram posts, a man proposes to his partner with his shoe right next to his foot — presumably because he would not want to crease his Cactus Jack 4 Jordans while kneeling. His other posts feature Kanye power-walking, wearing layers on layers and bright red sweatpants cuffed into pink socks, Beyoncé wearing a red Adidas bodysuit reclining on hundreds of shoes, and sorted Lucky Charms marshmallows lined in rows next to a rolled 20 dollar bill, as if they are about to be snorted. @liljupiterr’s page is not purely fashion, although the New Yorker applauds him for his inscrutable hypebeast cool, because there is much more than clothing in the mix. I take fault with identifying him as a simple “influencer” because he has too much of a personality — my favorite online — but what does it mean when your personality is underpinned by brands, or becomes a brand of its own? In an era that blends streetwear with celebrity fashion, thanks to a certain brand of Instagram account, it becomes difficult to distinguish capitalist schemers from fashion visionaries.
What is @liljupiterr’s brand? Influencers have many distinct styles of curation. By one oversimplified delineation, one common brand is targeted at middle class white girls that go to music festivals, and another is targeted at people that admire New York high fashion designers who follow in the vein of European couturiers. @liljupiterr’s feed blurs the line between high culture and street culture, or rather transforms the latter into the former in the most novel fashion. @liljupiterr juxtaposes Lucky Charms, drugs, and memes with haute couture sneakers — many of which are rare, beautiful, and custom-made. They do not come out of big-name fashion houses, but instead brands that have been voted up by larger numbers of regular people who value style — although they are becoming those fashion houses through collabs and soaring demand. Streetwear further aims to incorporate high fashion into its look — @liljupiterr’s subjects wear Dior, Versace, Gucci, and Balenciaga, and those brands have visibly taken inspiration from streetwear. @liljupiterr provides more (stylistically if not financially) accessible high fashion, which many can appreciate much more than the clothing of siloed fashion houses that could not be worn day-to-day.
@liljupiterr’s fashion could only be conveyed through his motley feed. @liljupiterr does the hard work of cherry-picking clout, not only in terms of fashion. If you like his fashion, it is likely because you have similar overall “taste” — it creates a positive feedback loop of validation in which liking his general feed means you like his fashion sense, which again means you probably like his non-fashion visual Instagram personality. The artists most represented are Kanye and A$AP Rocky (two artists whose music I love), skateboarders are rampant (I skateboard), and random posts, like a TI-84 reading “SOMETIMES THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT A PERSON ISNT THE WAY THEY ACTUALLY ARE,” indicate interest in a specific type of message. In a way, fashion becomes about your sense of humor, taste in cars, and taste in art as well — @liljupiterr’s feed is a remake of how the fashion industry markets itself through association with other “attractive” culture.
It is exhilarating to see the way that an unparalleled culture is manifest in streetwear Instagram pages, especially @liljupiterr’s. But streetwear in other places and accounts can also be appropriative. It stems from black culture, and it has become a trend that many white boys who don the same several-hundred-dollar streetwear styles are the same ones who idolize black culture and listen to hip-hop and rap as they dap each other up and use black slang. Popular Instagram accounts can provide a form of democratic validation of style — as opposed to large, predominantly white companies like Vogue spotlighting black styles late and promoting them on their platforms — but on another, they play into the same bind of idolizing certain labels, be it Jordans, Nike, Adidas, or Louis Vuitton.
@liljupiterr, along with other accounts like @thupreem, the lesser known sneaker account @bigktheboss, and a number of others, elevate a select few brands — this much is shared by all influencer accounts. He simultaneously provides an ironic critique of brand obsession: There are photos of a roll of toilet paper with Nike check marks on each perforated sheet and sneakers with butchered brand names. He disproportionately shares collabs with “AIR” written in quotation marks, or in another, “FOR WALKING,” on the shoe — the quotes add an element of irony. @liljupiterr is wonderfully self-aware for mocking the materialist, brand-oriented culture he celebrates, unlike most influencers.
Still, the culture of streetwear, especially on Instagram, is predominantly male. @liljupiterr’s page features a number of re-shares of women in bikinis, implying that this is what it takes for women to fit into an aesthetic of skater boys and artsy kids. It promotes highly specific beauty norms, such as the body types and facial features, many like those of the Kardashians, and much of it is marketed to the male gaze. @liljupiterr, like much of the culture of streetwear, is not all-encompassing and while innovative, sometimes fails to be progressive.
While Instagram streetwear is often consumed by an appropriative audience and sometimes edges on sexism, it is a part of fashion culture that has so many merits. It is ridiculously inventive, in a way for which only high fashion used to be credited. It shifts the source of merit in fashion from Eurocentric standards to the urban population of whichever locale it pertains to and the people, including those of color, that define and evaluate it. Instagram pages can provide a zeitgeist and render visible all the nuances of what people like, in addition to being a platform for people to curate, inspire, and consume art.

There’s not much sex in the Bible — at least, explicitly — but there’s plenty of it in “Naamah,” Sarah Blake’s début novel about Noah’s wife as she struggles to maintain her own sanity and, of course, the sanity of her family members. After all, Naamah is the matriarch from whose efforts the rest of humanity will spring. Her daughter-in-law gets pregnant, in a rare instance of heterosexual sex, yet the bulk of the sex scenes are between Naamah and a female angel or between Naamah and Bethel, the lover she left behind in the flood and whose presence she misses more with each passing day. These scenes distract Naamah from a longing for her past, her fatigue with present, and her worry for the future all at once. Blake uses these moments, along with the preponderance of dream scenes to establish Naamah’s discontent with the lot she’s drawn. What could have been equally, if not more, interesting, would have been greater interaction among the characters aboard the ark as another means of exploring this female perspective of a well-known Biblical story.
Naamah’s role is to keep others happy without consideration for herself, even if she wants to say (as she does in the novel’s early pages): “‘I am not fine where I am. I am on a boat in the middle of a flood that was high enough to cover trees. And wasn’t there a mountain to the east of us? Did it cover the mountain? I haven’t seen anything in months.’” In this way, Blake’s retelling transcends its Biblical roots and grounds itself firmly in 21st century dialogue surrounding the concept of “emotional labor.” At one point, Naamah journeys to the present day to see how humanity turns out, and confronts the existence of air conditioning and “Law and Order: SVU,” and probably wonders if feeling stifled, bored, and unfulfilled aboard the ark is really worth it. She finds it baffling and unfamiliar, but is at least comforted by the fact that God ceased with what Naamah seems to think is massacre of the human race. It’s an odd scene, but it deftly unites watery past and modern present.
Naamah goes to many dream-places, befriends a cockatoo she names Jael, has sex with an angel (many, many times), has sex with another daughter-in-law (it’s all above board, but you’ll want to read the book for more context), and hangs out with dead children in another dream world. These scenes lend the novel a sense of ethereality, but detract from the very real tensions between Naamah and Noah, her sons, and their wives. This resentment bubbles beneath the surface, especially between husband and wife, but the reader doesn’t get much access to it because Blake doesn’t grant it to us. If these are the people Naamah has been trapped with for an incalculable amount of time, wouldn’t there be arguments, things left unsaid, petty grievances? Beyond a few short scenes, these relationships are not explored.
Interestingly, the lack of setting — beyond the scene of the boat’s various decks and the expanse of water around the characters — might make it difficult to write a novel that can stay afloat long enough without becoming boring, but Blake describes Naamah’s interior life without dissolving into spiraling rumination. The characters’ dialogue is fast-paced, mimicking actual speech well enough to be believable. In short, Blake writes a good story: She makes us care about the characters in one way or another, and as the novel progresses, many of them have parts of their inner psychology revealed in a way that makes the reader forget that these people are, theoretically, based on rough sketches of their Biblical counterparts. Naamah receives the greatest interiority. She confronts very real anxieties, but is soon reminded that she has to go on with her day of taking care of others and the animals. There’s no point in going stir-crazy about God’s intentions or whether the water will ever recede.
Blake’s book could not be labeled as “comic,” but there are moments of levity too. The angel, a messenger of God, shocks Naamah in saying “fuck you,” God appears as both a vulture and a teenage boy (and in both shapes manages to annoy Naamah and become annoyed by her), and a scene between two of the sons perfectly encapsulates the (funny but tragic) male confusion about the elusiveness of the female orgasm. Such moments grounded the otherwise ethereal and unmoored backdrop of the overarching story.
The reader finds out that Naamah is beautiful — “her smile left her eyes large and sparkling in the sun, as if two golden beetles had been living there all along, flashing back and forth to black, waiting for moments in the sun like this, at the edge of the boat” — but that she sometimes wants to forget that she’s a woman in the first place. This thought only appears at the very end, but adds another layer to Blake’s female-focused retelling: Maybe such stories shouldn’t be about emphasizing womanhood, but simply about emphasizing “being,” as told by a new, fresh voice.

Setting a novel in Paris almost acts as a source of comfort: It’s famous, many people have been there, and inevitably a known landmark or two will make an appearance. The pitfalls begin, however, when the setting becomes more interesting than the story. The plot of Ayşegül Savaş’ début novel, “Walking on the Ceiling,” is situated by the river Seine, near the Gare du Nord, and on the sidewalk of Boulevard Saint-Michel, but what’s notable is that these locations are more memorable than any activity that takes place there. Nunu, the protagonist who has recently settled into the city by way of Istanbul and London, meets M., a British writer who captivates her, intimidates her, and deigns to talk with her. The story chronicles her many conversations with him and her simultaneous exploration of her complicated relationship with her late mother. Yet it seems that even this self-discovery takes place in the context of Nunu’s relationship with the three other men who walk in and out of her life at different points, stifling her own voice and giving no justifiable reason for why anyone should care about this character.
Nunu appears to float along, uncertain of herself and what she’s doing in Paris in the first place. Even before she meets M., she skips the classes she’s enrolled in and finds herself intimidated by her fellow students. Sure, she makes a friend, but he disappears early on when she begins to meander through the city. There’s nothing inherently wrong with such a feeling, which is certainly a relatable one, but inaction can only sustain a plot so far. After all, plot is inherently character-driven, and if one of them, especially the main character, is not doing anything, the affected sense of ethereality and winsomeness wears off quickly.
A character lacking emotional depth is all the more difficult to bear because she should theoretically have a great deal of it: She is in the process of writing her own book, has coped with a father who dealt with a mental illness throughout her childhood, and is haunted by the memories of a mother whom she rebuffed time and time again — actions which she now regrets. Such details, especially the first of these, cry out for more detail and depth. Instead, the reader is regaled with many details about M.s’ writing and interior angst, much of which seems like an act, and is one that diminishes Nunu’s presence in her own story. She even says, “But by the time I saw him again, I knew little more about M. than I did during our first walk. It seemed that instead of covering long distances, we were digging deeper with our heels on a dirt track.”
Perhaps this is one of Savaş’ intentions: Certainly her writing is deft and delicate enough to subtly hint at Nunu’s feeling of being overshadowed by M.’s wow factor. Sentences like the following back up this hunch: “I remember that M. spoke French clumsily, making many mistakes, but without apology. Waiters never reverted to English with him, as they sometimes did with me, even though my French was probably better, certainly more correct, from my studies at university.” Halfway through the novel, Savaş writes that Nunu’s writing imitates M.’s, as if to further show how much their seemingly beneficial relationship hinders her protagonist’s creative process and independence.
If that’s Savaş’ goal, then she succeeded, but at times, it feels as though the novel can’t quite decide what it wants to be. Nunu displays such a lack of agency that she remains stagnant for much of the plot, such that the novel consists of her remembering Luke, the ex who tried to psychoanalyze her into the girlfriend he wanted her to be and remembering her mother, but without much progress. Such is the human condition, to ruminate and frustrate the act of moving forward, but unfortunately a novel must do more than that: It should capture this aspect of the human condition and provide commentary, attempt to resolve even the smallest portion of such angst, or transcend it.
Nunu’s spark of progress, a welcome relief to the lack of plot, comes only at the very (very!) end when she decides M.s’ lack of awareness — selfishness by another name — regarding her emotional needs or inner life simply won’t cut it anymore: She thinks, “It was moments like these that made me think that our friendship meant different things to me and M. At least, it was in those moments that I realized M. had other worlds in which he was equally at ease, and to which he was eager to return.” It’s perhaps the only moment when the reader can cheer for her, or feel much emotion for her at all. Nunu notices M.’s surprise at her own capabilities: “M. remarked that I knew my way around those streets like the back of my hand,” as though he hadn’t expected her to be able to do anything beyond listen to him, enraptured.
Savaş’ description of Nunu’s interior is particularly apt, as are various other phrases and sentences sprinkled throughout — they almost, but not quite, redeem the lack of plot. Particularly memorable is “Women had invisible pantries of wisdom for losing weight, for varicose veins, for reducing cellulite.” But for a novel to be considered holistically worth one’s time, it has to do more than rely on these sentences that are few and far in between.
One of the most heartbreaking and relatable lines is one in the final pages: “I had made up my mind that once he asked me directly why I was upset, I would tell him a true story, something simple and direct. This was the condition I had set and I waited impatiently for him to understand, to want to know and admit he cared.” Nunu expresses, succinctly, one of the ultimate human desires: To be not only seen, but understood — and loved for it. Savaş’ prose is at its finest here — if only some of her descriptions were more purposeful and her characters more developed. Imagine what a distinguishable plot and active character could have done to compliment such a pair of sentences.

Have you ever tasted a soy and oyster sauce omelette? I never had, until one day, while scrambling eggs, cheddar cheese, and red peppers, my eyes darted to the soy sauce and oyster sauce peeking out behind olive oil on the spice rack. This combination of flavors never occured to me before, but in that moment, I didn’t question my decision to douse the scramble with either sauce. Swirling the spatula, I became overwhelmed with delightfully nostalgic feelings, like warm memories of cracking eggs onto a frying pan and fighting over dim sum dishes with my sister. While happily chewing on my omelette, I wondered if by adding dashes of soy and oyster sauce, popular Chinese ingredients, I could call my cheesy egg scramble Chinese, or at the very least, Chinese-influenced.
From a young age, I’ve naturally distinguished between Chinese dishes, Chinese American dishes, and American dishes. These variations, between dishes such as mapo tofu, crab rangoons, and burgers, seemed straightforward to me. However, I recently began to question my right to make these associations. Where did my confidence in defining foods under labels come from in the first place? Do certain sauces or spices or the absence of other ingredients make a dish inherently Chinese? Or do labels come from the Chinese chefs preparing the food?
Much like the varied experiences of Chinese Americans in the United States, no particular ingredient, chef, or experience can decisively define Chinese American cuisine. The terms “Asian American” or “Chinese American” have been widely adopted by families and communities across the country. Despite its ubiquity today, arriving at these universally recognized terms has been a half-century old battle, and one frequently left out of history books. Up until the late 1960s, many Americans referred to products, businesses, or people coming from East Asia as “Oriental” or “exotic”. The terms found their way onto storefronts, menus, and even my mom’s SAT problem sheet. Frustrated by the West’s portrayal of East Asian people, Yuji Ichioka, an Asian-American historian and ethnic studies activist, coined the term “Asian American” in 1968 to discharge the patronizing and imperialist terms. To the delight of many activists, the terms “Asian American” and “Chinese American” soon replaced the condescending terms of the earlier half of the century, and eventually assumed visibility on restaurant awnings.
Ichioka paved the way for the first Chinese immigrant restaurateurs to earmark their dishes as Chinese American. Since Chinese American cuisines’ first plunge into the culinary world, hundreds of restaurants have championed the Chinese American label. Chinese American fast food chains such as Panda Express have become household names and kung pao chicken and broccoli beef have become late night staples. But recently, Chinese American cuisine has been adapting and encompassing more people’s experiences, due the influx of second and third generation Chinese American chefs entering the culinary world.
Restaurants opening up in the past few years have uniquely marketed their food as Chinese American, in many ways that diverge from its original definition. In Boston, Chef Irene Li’s Mei Mei advertises its beef and broccoli scallion pancake sandwiches and smoked haddock fritters. Danny Bowien’s Mission Chinese Food populates their menu with Kung Pao Pastrami and Sichuan Carbonara. Not only does their Chinese American food draw from personal experience growing up in a diverse country and favorite non-Chinese dishes — it’s tasty too. By challenging previous assumptions about the creative limits of food, these chefs are further expanding how people consume and view Chinese American cuisine, as they righteously should be.
New endeavors in Chinese American and fusion cuisine have opened tremendous new doors for chefs and have expanded the tastes of foodies in the United States. It is also unfair to discredit and disrespect the history Chinese American food that allowed it to gain its national platform. In early April, food media writers unleashed a flurry of articles condemning nutritionist Arielle Haspel, the owner of NYC’s newly opened Chinese American restaurant Lucky Lee’s. In a since-deleted Instagram post, Haspel claimed to healthify Chinese food. “We heard you’re obsessed with lo mein but rarely eat it. You said it makes you feel bloated and icky the next day? Well, wait until you slurp up our HIGH lo mein. Not too oily. Or salty,” she wrote. Lucky Lee’s portrayal of Chinese food highlights the importance of thinking intentionally about Chinese American food, history, and the ways we choose to transform and market it.
Chinese American and American chefs today have redefined the boundaries of Chinese American culture through the lens of their own upbringings; their cuisine reflects the changing demographics of the United States. The next time you whip up some non-Chinese food with hoisin and XO sauce, know that it is a testament to the possibilities of diasporic cuisine.
Correction: May 1, 2019
A previous version of this article misspelled Danny Bowien's name. 
— Contributing writer Jess L. Eng’s column, "Takeaways From Chinese America," wrestles with the possibilities and boundaries of food culture from a third-generation Chinese American perspective.

Clementine von Radics’ third poetry collection “In a Dream You Saw a Way To Survive” is unimpressive and feels somewhat underdeveloped. Even with some successful emotional moments, the collection is an essentially an unoriginal transition from slam poetry to the written word. The book is characterized by mainly short and personal poems centered around the arc of recovery from the dissolution of a relationship, the process of letting go, and then falling in love again. Other themes are featured throughout including pieces on mental illness, abortion, and nostalgia, but reflections on heartbreak and healing are the heart of the collection. Other than a few gems with interesting perspectives, the collection is generally lacking and fails to deliver distinctive and memorable works that last beyond momentary emotional beats.
Unfortunately, the language used to discuss heartbreak and infidelity fail to stand out from the broad expanse of work by modern poets working in the vein of Rupi Kaur’s short and punchy poems. Several pieces come off as cliché with lines like, “The mistake was mine for trusting you” and “I am afraid I will love you forever and we will never be in the same room again.” The latter line comes from “The Fear,” a piece that is essentially just two sentences with lines breaks, given the lack of figurative language, imagery, or even surprise that generally characterizes poetry. Pieces like “The Fear” and “Confession:” seem more like diary musings than thoughtfully crafted poetry: They may carry some emotional weight, but ultimately lack the craft or ingenuity it takes to make them compelling. The collection also persistently uses metaphors of birds, broken glass and buildings, mouths; yet, this connection between poems does not seem to build in a meaningful way so much as it just repeats.
The overall organization of the collection is also confusing. While the basic arc of the poems is intuitive, a woman grapples with her partner’s cheating and departure before coming to terms with it and falling in love again, unrelated poems are interspersed. The collection ultimately touches on a myriad of topics but how exactly those other topics fit in the scheme of this romantic development is unclear.
The collection is actually more successful when it discusses subjects unrelated to romance. For instance, “A Conversation Between My Therapist and the Mouth That Sometimes Belongs to Me” dances around the edges of mania and mental health with unexpected perspectives and development. It demands a second read and unfolds with examination. “Still We Swing” draws on nearly cliché nostalgic beats of adventurous high school summers, but captures all the cathartic angst of “Our dirty scramble of discount limbs… A scream where a family should be.” “Post-term” discusses abortion with incredible brevity and language like “[I] became a pregnant hollow. A swelling brood of Absence” and “I open my mouth and her hands fall out.” The next poem in the collection, “To the Protester Outside the Clinic Who Called Me a Murderer” also presents an impactful perspective on loss and desire but is also an example of a piece that would almost certainly perform better spoken than read.
Von Radics is one of many spoken word poets to recently publish printed collections of their work. Yet, this type of publication essentially diminishes the critical distinctions between spoken word and traditional poetry, in that spoken word is fundamentally a word-based performance art. Translated to the page, these pieces can often lose some of their kinetic energy and read like prose with less attention paid to concision and visualization on the page. Particularly as performance poetry can now be spread and immortalized through video and the Internet, it is unclear why these pieces need to be reduced to the page when it does not seem to match their intended medium.
Ultimately, Von Radics’ collection features a few unique and fascinating perspectives and manipulations of language, but not enough to leave a lasting impact in the midst of several overworked themes and forms. It is difficult to discern what makes this collection distinctive and memorable, but it makes for a very quick read that often pulls the heartstrings. Perhaps it is better to just look up videos of Von Radics’ performances instead.

Packed with romance, misogyny, war, and above all, nostalgia, the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Dogfight” made impressive use of staging and dynamic musical performances to display the the broad harms of toxic masculinity in its complex characters. The emotional journey is steeped in the failings of a familiar yet distinct era.
“Dogfight,” a musical by Justin Paul, Benj Pasek, and Peter Duchan, is an adaptation of a 1991 film of the same name. It follows a group of young marines in 1963 who hold a “dogfight” contest the night before they ship out to war: Whoever brings the ugliest girl to the party wins. Eddie Birdlace, played by Hugh G. Strike ’19, brings a waitress, Rose (Miranda L. Mize ’20), who makes him question his behavior and values as he falls for her. The adaptation comments on toxic masculinity, flawed perceptions of heroism, and the devastation of war in a unflinching way that avoids feeling sanctimonious or trite.
One of the most striking elements of the performance was the dynamic use of space. Staged in the Loeb Ex theater, stage director Karalyn E. Joseph ’21 and scenic designer Jamie E. P. Ostmann ’21 made impressive use of a small stage right in front of the audience. Engaging with the balcony level above the stage, the aisles in the audience, and creative sets gave the limited space dimension and allowed for numerous changes of setting. Actors also took full advantage of the stage in several musical numbers with impressive and tight choreography.
As for the temporal setting, “Dogfight” did a great job of capturing the 1960s. The whole musical worked extensively with time in a frame narrative of Eddie returning home after the war and an inner story based almost entirely in his last day before leaving. The song “Some Kinda Time” successfully set a nostalgic tone discussing at once the era of the 1960s and the exuberance of youth, expressed by shifts in lighting throughout the song. Throughout the show, marines talk excitedly about the Vietnam War, and the dramatic irony of their anticipation against modern audiences’ knowledge of the atrocities is almost painful. Somehow, the unabashed misogyny embedded in the musical’s premise and its male characters also seem to belong to a different time while still feeling all too relevant and contemporary. The sets and most of the costumes were not grounded in a particular time period, making it easy to forget at certain points that the marines’ mistreatment of women and hyper-masculine violence is meant to take place half a century ago.
“Dogfight” shines in its discussion and presentation of toxic masculinity through complex and human characters and strong performances from the “three B’s,” a trio of marines: Eddie, Ralphie Boland (Beck A. Saine ’22), and Dickie Bernstein (Ben A. K. Topa ’21). Even though Eddie’s romance with Rose is a central part of the story, the compelling dynamics between the three young men stood out, accentuated by the actors’ chemistry and strong musical performances. The characters expressed despicable behavior in degrading women and even assaulting a prostitute in a scene that visually accentuated unsettling power dynamics, but they were not vilified so much as portrayed as human products of a society that taught them to be heroes who take what they wanted. Songs like “Hometown Hero’s Tickertape Parade,” full of aggression and militaristic choreography, served as reminders that while these men were abusing their power over women they were also boys with no idea what they were getting into with the war. The musical did not make excuses for them, and instead presented their stories complexly.
While certain songs like “Dogfight” struggled with balance of various vocal and instrumental elements, ensemble songs like “Some Kinda Time” and “Hey, Good Lookin’” displayed tight vocals and dance performances with impressive harmonies and unity. In particular, the war scenes featured incredible sound, lighting, and projection work to create a shocking dramatic spectacle. The sequence concluded with a shot of Eddie huddled alone center stage as the visual and sonic mayhem faded in a heartbreaking loss of innocence and brotherhood. Then, the stark contrast of Eddie’s return home with his expectations of the “hometown ticker tape parade” sharply critiqued the treatment of American veterans. Strike and Mize’s resonant performances carry these developments and the musical’s bittersweet conclusion. The ending, like the show as a whole, presented lingering and complex critiques firmly grounded in an emotional core with impressive technical elements and gripping performances across the cast.

Artistic headwear is not exclusively the province of royals. Boston-based Irish milliner Marie Galvin brings a touch of modern glamor to the traditional hatinators, fascinators, and derby hats of yesteryear at her studio in the local SoWa Art and Design District. Whatever Galvin single-handedly makes — from haute couture pieces to more understated berets and cloche hats made of felt and other diaphanous fabrics — are modern and timeless at once, familiar with their vintage shapes yet unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. Her unique hats are beloved by celebrities like Alicia Keys and locals alike. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Galvin to discuss her creative inspirations, her Irish heritage, and the trajectory of her style.
THE HARVARD CRIMSON: When and how did you start making hats?
MARIE GALVIN: I was studying fashion and was disenchanted with the whole process, and then decided that Boston needed a fabulous hat designer, and then from Ireland, I decided I wanted to bring hats back into fashion here that looked like the ones we were wearing over there. So I got a studio, started going there every day, and I basically taught myself. I come from a very artistic family, and it sort of just happened organically. I loved it, and it just started really well, and that was 20 years ago. I’ve been here a lot longer than 20 years, but the business is 20 years [old]. My formative years, I was not concentrating on what I wanted to be when I grow up, too much. Everyone always thinks it’s such a glamorous job, but it’s really hard work. I love creating, and I need to do it every day or I’ll die.
THC: You’ve been based in Boston for 20 years. Are your hats at all influenced by Boston culture or New England styles?
MG: I love the architecture here, and that does influence me. Boston architecture is beautiful. I’m always looking up at buildings here, and the public parks as well — like the [Boston] Commons is gorgeous. There’s a lot of beautiful landscaping.
THC: What is your creative process like? Where do you draw inspiration for each unique hat you make?
MG: Trips to Ireland are really important for me to go and see my family. It’s such a beautiful country that I come from. I have to get there every year, if not once, at least twice, a year. My influences are a lot in nature and architecture — not the places you’d think you’d draw it from, like other hat designers or other fashion designers. I try not to be influenced by any of that. I don’t even look at magazines anymore. So a lot of it is just sometimes out walking with my dog. I’m very in tune with what’s going on around me, naturewise.
THC: What do you hope for the future of your millinery? Is your collection or style evolving in a certain direction?
MG: This is one of the things that’s been always important to me, and that is — I watched other designers get into that rut, where it’s like, they never evolve, so I’ve always wanted to evolve. And I know this maybe sounds conceited, but where I’ve really drawn a lot of inspiration recently in my recent collections is from my past collections, from where I began. Because I began in couture. You see that hat [her self-described “masterpiece,” one of the first hats she made] and I can never, ever be as good as that hat again. That was just a labor of love, and took a long time to craft, and you can see there’s three different looks that it can be worn. I love it — it’s a great silhouette. Everyone covets it. 
It seems to be difficult for some people [to evolve], but I’ve been lucky, and I always fear that, and like, what if I wake up one day and I can’t — I’m out of ideas. But that’s the fun thing about making sculptural headwear. I never run out of ideas, and my mind is constantly chaos, but it’s constantly going, and you know what it’s like in these modern times that we live in. Everybody has to be ahead of the curve now — even with media, it’s changing by the minute. So is fashion. So trying to be relevant — that’s what I always try to be: Relevant.

Kacey E. Gill ’20 has more than a full plate. The junior joint-concentrator in Social Studies and African and African American Studies just finished a year-long tenure as President of the Association of Black Harvard Women, a commitment she balanced while also working at The Harvard Foundation, modeling with Maggie Inc. and Docherty, and designing her own clothing line, Strange Fruit Clothing. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Gill just after the one year anniversary of Strange Fruit Clothing to talk about her work in fashion and dreams going forward.
The Harvard Crimson: What was your first memory of style or fashion? What would you call your stylistic awakening?
Kacey E. Gill: I think it’s something that I’ve always been interested in. When I was a little kid I was in a couple of beauty pageants, I used to try on all my mom’s clothes — the kind of stereotypical things. I worked at the mall all though high school, multiple jobs. I literally worked at a bunch of boutiques: Aéropostale, Madewell, Lucky Brand jeans — pretty much the whole mall — and so I’d go from my shift and I’d walk through the mall and I’d meet all of these different people who were working in different stores and see: What are the new drops? What are the new styles? How are people communicating what should be bought by the consumer? I got a lot of insight.
THC: How would you describe your personal sense of style?
KEG: I’m a very mood-driven person, so I think there’s a broad range. Overall I really like elevated looks — elevated with an asterisk. People, when they think of elevated, they think of “fancy,” and that’s not what I mean when I say elevated. I just mean polished. You can definitely have elevated street style that is polished and has the nuances of a real fashion eye, which is what I love. I love pushing boundaries and making statements and really bringing what you would see on the runway in couture in an accessible, real-life way.
THC: What inspired you to launch Strange Fruit Clothing and why last year, in particular?
KEG: Strange Fruit was kind of the intersection of different parts of my life. I wanted to find a way to explore the experiences of black women, in particular, through fashion. I think that especially right now with our generation, there’s a really interesting phenomenon where people define who they are by what they wear and what they own, basically, which I have my own thoughts on… I really didn’t know what I was getting into when I started. I had this vision, but it was a short-term version. I knew I wanted to really play with words. I write poetry, I’m a poet, that’s another part of my life — so I really wanted to play with how language can be presented on fashion. I worked over the summer before my sophomore year to get all the logistical pieces together and just did it.
THC: The individual pieces in your line are inspired by interviews with black women. Is that something you plan on continuing moving forward?
KEG: For me it was really important to make sure that I wasn’t just reflecting my own black experience, because I do acknowledge also that I have a very narrow and particular experience within that and there’s such variety and such beauty in the larger experiences of black women. I felt it was wrong to not include that. So the interviews were a first step. I think that that’s always going to be a part of my work in multiple capacities. Going forward, I’m really interested in incorporating art in different ways. I don’t know that it will necessarily be the words of an interview, but different facets of black women’s lives.
THC: How do you see fashion and art as intersecting?
KEG: I think fashion is art. I think that people like to deny that because fashion is more consumer-based than other forms of art. I also think its accessibility to a broader range of people makes others uncomfortable, this whole idea of what is “high art.” People don’t want to say fashion is often high art because all sorts of people can access it. You don’t necessarily need a certain education to be able to appreciate it. I think there’s power in that accessibility of fashion.
THC: Do you have a favorite piece from your line so far? If so, which is it and why?
KEG: I’m actually in this interesting transition phase where I am taking all of the old collection one pieces and customizing them. Originally I had one design and probably 10 items of that design. Every single one is going to be different, so various cutting, sewing, adding different things. I’m working on a piece right now that is the “black skin” shirt, it has the logo and it says “black skin.” I’m working on that and adding all this beading and draping, it’s really sick.
THC: So it’s not just design, you’re manipulating the clothing and sewing and cutting. Did you learn those skills as you went to achieve the things that you wanted to do in fashion?
KEG: Literally I’ve learned it all off of YouTube — and also trying and failing. I spent three hours a couple weeks ago learning how to sew wire into these shoes I was working on and I, like, destroyed my hands. Trial and error is something that’s really big for me.
THC: What is your dream for your clothing line and for your art? What do you see as the future for your line and your artistic vision?
KEG: I really want to dive into more creative elements of [the line] and spend a lot more time on each individual piece, which is going to impact price points, accessibility, and also wearability to an extent. I’m really interested right now in also pursuing fashion that is not meant to be worn on a day-to-day basis, versus the original collection which was that. It is always my goal though to highlight the voices of people who are often ignored or overlooked in our society. So I do think that I need to find a way to incorporate accessibility back into what I’m doing. I don’t intend to make money off of fashion, that’s not my goal, but I want people to look at what I make or look at the messages that are behind what I’m making and feel something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, editors of celebrity fashion blog Go Fug Yourself, came under fire after actress Olivia Munn tweeted “a short essay” on April 26. In the post, Munn reprimands “messy journalists who throw out baseless musings as if they’re facts,” condemning “fashion-policing celebrity” for its active misogyny because it “mainly focuses on females and not men.” By Munn’s estimation, media outlets like Go Fug Yourself are to blame for misogynist ills: “Blogs like theirs have been around for awhile, with their snarkiness and hypocrisy on full display,” Munn wrote. “And we’ve accepted it because as women we’ve been conditioned to believe that being publicly chastised for our weight, our looks, or our choice in clothing is an acceptable part of our existence.”
Numerous commenters, celebrities among them, were quick to jump to Cocks and Morgan’s defense. Actress and screenwriter Zoe Kazan tweeted that she found their post about one of her ensembles “kind and insightful,” despite the fact that it was critical in tone. Another user pointed out that Munn’s argument 一 that criticizing celebrity fashion is an inherently sexist practice 一 wrongly repurposed the language of social justice and gender activism in the name of self-defense. “I just think you can’t climb up on your soapbox and shout ‘But FEMINISM’ when you don’t like what’s being said about your costume,” she wrote on Twitter. “People get to have opinions about public things. Most fashion critics are pretty careful to only critique curated outfits.”
In the case of Go Fug Yourself, Munn’s rebuke was mostly unwarranted. A quick survey of recent posts on Go Fug Yourself reveals incisive, yet (in the grand scheme of online celebrity discourse) generally innocuous content. Recent posts call Taylor Swift’s Time 100 dress “twee,” for example, and one of Marion Cotillard’s Lacoste sweaters “shockingly bad.” Admittedly, it would be unpleasant for anyone, celebrity or otherwise, to read such vehement censure about sartorial decisions that — in the case of many celebrities — were made on their behalf by a team of stylists. Yet the content of their criticism is careful to avoid ageist, sexist commentary that objectifies celebrity bodies, the way that so many other outlets do. How often do we read scathing tabloid articles that comment point-blank on a celebrity’s cellulite, how they look in a bikini, or the dreaded “post-baby body”? In comparison, Go Fug Yourself seems pretty innocuous.
Whether the Go Fug Yourself writers are culpable or not, Munn’s post opens a contentious conversation about critiquing celebrity fashion. Munn’s point is valid: Why do we care so much how celebrities, disproportionately the female ones, look? At what point does critique target not just the clothes, but the body of the wearer?
Surely, this is a gendered issue. Any woman who has walked the red carpet implicitly consents to thorough cross-examination about the designer of her dress, supplier of her jewelry, and, at one point in history, a special mini-red carpet equipped with its own camera to inspect the state of her immaculate manicure. Most celebs play along — as Munn prefaces her essay, it comes with the territory — yet some, like Reese Witherspoon, have resisted the ritualistic red carpet interrogation, even framing it as a feminist issue.
To be fair, men are also featured on style blogs, but less frequently, and not with the level of borderline-forensic examination on their bodies and faces. Red carpet attire for men has, in recent years, branched out from the classic suit-and-tie combo — think Timothée Chalamet’s harness at the Golden Globes and Billy Porter’s Oscars floor length gown. Women, on the other hand, have to reinvent the wheel with a new dress at every event. Myriad other factors also come into play when beauty standards default to white, thin, and cisgender bodies.
Is there such thing as an apolitical fashion critique? Whether a celebrity looks “twee” or “fugly,” whether they’re pulling it off or crashing and burning — these opinions are, even if inadvertently, fundamentally bound up in assumptions about gender and race. Implicit bias works in strange ways. Maybe the enterprise of blogs like Go Fug Yourself isn’t completely evil, but it’s not without political consequence. Who knew that “who wore it best” was more than skin-deep?

Instead of playing music or adjusting the lights, Amazon’s Echo Look is designed to help customers “look their best.” It takes pictures of its owner in various outfits and decides which look best. Over time, the Echo Look can remember the outfits you own, learn your preferences, and recommend clothing in your style available for purchase on Amazon. Technology of this kind, however, prompts troubling questions: How much data personal are we willing to hand Amazon? How much stock should we even put in the opinion of a gadget? Is this just a ruse to increase sales? And if fashion is an expression of art, what does it mean if a computer is able to generate it?
Before pondering what this means for fashion in general, it’s important to think about the consequences of such a device. Of course, Amazon already has a decent understanding of its consumers: It knows your address, what you buy, and what you click on, but don’t buy. But now, the Echo Look will take full-length pictures of its customers and analyze their bodies’ dimensions, commonly worn colors, facial features, and a host of other data that can’t be gleaned from the type of headphones you buy or your most-listened-to musician.
And why stop there? Although Amazon claims it will not use these photos to analyze the background — after all, there is valuable information about you as a consumer all over your house — there is nothing in its privacy policy that says it can’t do so. In other words, Amazon is free to see the posters you choose to hang on your walls and the kind of plants you choose to keep in your house. Although this information would likely only be used to tailor their product suggestions for you, the lack of privacy sets an alarming precedent.
This data-driven approach to fashion has troubling implications for clothing as well as art in a more general sense. To admit that the Echo Look is able to analyze body types, skin color, hair style, and other characteristics and match them to the best colors, cuts, and designs seems to indicate that fashion is formulaic in nature. It is fundamentally true that certain body types are better accentuated in particular types of clothes, and that some colors can look drastically different depending on the wearer’s skin tone. However, the clothes in your closet probably all look relatively okay on you — clothes that don’t suit you likely won’t be bought in the first place — so how does it decide between two decent choices? It seems highly unlikely that a computer will be able to factor in all the things that go into choosing an outfit: the weather, your mood, your destination, the company you’ll keep, the statement you’re trying to make, and so on.
The Echo Look just seems like a thinly veiled excuse for Amazon to accumulate more data about its consumers. With the wardrobes of its customers catalogued, the company can recommend clothing items using the same algorithms it uses for all its other products. Essentially, Amazon is tricking us into paying $100 to tailor clothings ads more specifically to you, making you spend even more money on Amazon.

The raindrops settle against the window of our common room in Grays Hall. It’s 11 p.m. on a Thursday night, and my roommate and I are finishing up papers due the next day. Music plays in the background, and the next song comes on. Immediately, I recognize the old classic: John Cougar Mellencamp’s “Small Town.” I was back home in Ohio the last time I heard it. Hearing the same song in my Harvard common room, I realized that I became a different person with new views, experiences and perceptions of myself over the past year.
I hear the opening guitar riff, the steel jangle of the tambourine, and in an instant I’m taken back to a place distant from the scramble of Harvard Yard. Back to tubing on the lake and laughing so much my stomach hurt. Back to midnight drives down gravel roads in the woods, bright lights scanning for deer. Back to lying on the grass at Oak Park next to the train tracks, watching the midwestern sky explode with fireworks on the Fourth of July.
Hearing Mellencamp’s Midwestern anthem felt different to me this time though. Amid deadlines, summer scheduling, and p-sets, this song provided an escape. And for the first time since coming to Harvard, I felt a sense of pride about where I came from and gratitude for the memories of my childhood years.
Growing up in a small town in southern Ohio, I lived out a childhood that doesn’t seem particularly real at times. I knew everyone in my graduating class since elementary school. Three of my past teachers lived down the street from me. Every week, the whole town would put on their cowboy boots and root for the home team under the Friday Night Lights. The American Dream had been bottled up in twist off Coca-Cola bottles for us at the Country Fresh market, and we drank them every Friday after school.
When school got out for the summer, we’d ride our bikes everywhere. We’d play pickup games at the park and gutterball at the pool. If the ’90s movie “The Sandlot” was based off of a Midwestern small town, it would have been mine. My best friend once successfully re-enacted the CPR scene with an older lifeguard at the community pool. We gave him serious props for it.
Yet I always knew that I would leave. As Mellencamp says, “I had seen it all in my small town.”  While my small town provided my parents with a comfortable environment to raise a family, and a carefree childhood that I am very grateful for, as I grew older I began to notice some things.
My first memory of self-introspection was in first grade when my teacher mispronounced my last name on the first day in a way that sounded just like “Ur-anus.” From then on my friends made fun of my name, turning it into a laughingstock. Other names also came about: “Dominicano,” “Jorge,” and others that I’d prefer not to say. When I first told my dad about the nicknames in first grade, he became visibly upset. My father, living far away from his Mexican-American family, struggled to provide my sister and I with the same experience that he had with his Latino family.
It wouldn’t have been possible in Ohio.
Friends would refer to my father as “George Lopez” just because he was the only other Latino they had ever known. I chose not to share my Mexican-American traditions with my friends, because I didn’t think they’d be interested. Everytime they came over for dinner, they’d ask for chicken nuggets or mac n' cheese.
It wasn’t until I came to Harvard that I began to feel comfortable seeking out my own identity and seriously thinking about who I was as an individual. Since coming to Harvard, I’ve made friends that have made me feel comfortable sharing my experiences as a Latino. For the first time in my life, I don’t feel like I have to wear a button down shirt and boat shoes just to make friends. I don’t have to stand in the football stands every Friday night or binge drink away my loneliness like the majority of my classmates did in high school to feel a part of the community.
Harvard has made me realize that there’s more to life than living in a small town for the rest of my life. Over the years a desire grew for something different, and ultimately, that’s why I chose to come to Harvard instead of Ohio State. Each day here is something new, learning from fellow classmates about their own experiences and interests, each different from my own. In many ways, it’s a microcosm of the world at large. Harvard has become a new home for me, and for that, I am eternally grateful.
I will always hold a place in my heart for John Mellencamp and his midwestern anthems. I’ll still dance along to them with my mom in our kitchen. Heck, I’ll sing them at the top of my lungs with the windows down in my car when I go back home this summer. But I’ve decided to make room in there for the other George that I didn’t give a voice to over the years. I’m going to listen to him more. I’m going to get to know him a little better.

Since this is my last column of the semester, and since I have exhausted my supply of pomposity and nonsense, I propose to round out the year with a smattering of suggestions for smoothing certain Harvard hangnails.
First: One of Board Plus and Crimson Cash needs to be abolished. The fact that they both exist indicates some kind of scam. Crimson Cash is obviously the nearer of the two to legal tender, whereas Board Plus appears magically like a non-fungible rebate on one’s tuition. But why can’t it be used to do laundry, rather than just to buy 24 packages of Milano cookies in Lamont during spring reading period when you have a week to spend $110, as I did two years ago? Perhaps this will be shocking, but I should rather use my Board Plus on laundry than on the baked goods of Barker Café.
If the counterargument is that the Harvard Square businesses won’t accept it, that means that “it” does not actually exist, and the LamCaf coffee could be distributed for free. If, on the other hand, it is really backed by the U.S. dollar, then combine it with Crimson Cash and let me get back to peeling wet socks out of the gaskets in the washing machines.
Second: The various op-eds appearing in this newspaper concerning Harvard University Dining Services meal schedules, though usually nothing more than opportunities for the authors to display their Mediterranean dining habits, nonetheless do us the service of drawing our attention to a more pressing issue: the fascistic creep of weekday interhouse restrictions at dinner. Whichever House did it first began a tariff war, and they’ve sprung up everywhere over the past few months. (Although I must say I don’t mind being kept out of Winthrop House, which lately has come to resemble Sarajevo circa July 1914). If the College is going to randomize the rising sophomores, they must at least be allowed to visit their friends for dinner ’twixt 6 and 7 p.m., even if they are so socially precocious as to have more than one friend at a time.
I would not, of course, object to shifting the dinner window one hour later — 5 to 7:15 p.m. rather precludes my white-tie cocktail hour — but I do not think the Houses need another blow to their social cohesion in the form of an all-day-long stream of food such that one forgets what meal one is eating.
Third: Classroom to Table, the best program Harvard has devised in the past hundred years, is routinely underfunded. I have no doubt that it is rather expensive, and perhaps the price limits need to be played with. But surely we could afford, in some sense, to reallocate some of the money currently being thrown away on condoms, lobster dinners, and concerts by Ponzi and Tiara. Harvard funds much nonsense, so by the time it strikes on a great idea, it has hamstrung itself. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, as I frequently say, is quite correct that much of the learning at the College goes on outside the classroom, so the chance for intimate conversations with professors ought to be a higher priority than, say, First Chance Dance (or Last, from what I hear).
Fourth: There are a few issues that will require fuller treatment in these pages in the future, not the least of which are the canting and ranting about shopping week that issue ceaselessly from the graduate student cartel, and the total fiasco that the Transcaroline Engineering Complex is going to be. The latter is, naturally, a more permanent problem than the former. For the time being, let us say that the conceits of bureaucrats high and petty should be at first politely and then rudely ignored, especially when the problem that so vexes them is which and how many interchangeably incompetent TFs can be assigned to an unfamiliar course on such short notice. (The distinctive and competent TFs, you will note, have always been able to manage, so the two camps sort themselves perfectly.)
As I say, I would not complain this way if I didn’t like the place so much, and it is painful to see it mismanaged in any respect. I hope to have provided some sort of service to prevent that; if not, at least the commenter people will have something to write about.

When Concordia Liberal Arts College in Canada invited Harvard Government Professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 to speak at its 40th anniversary gala this May, an unexpected wave of condemnations allegedly prompted administrators to subsequently disinvite him due to his self-declared “conservative” views on gender and sexuality. The move has sparked public controversy, not least from Mansfield himself.
Mansfield’s disinvitation, while from another institution, presents an opportunity for Harvard to meditate on how it goes about providing platforms for different speakers and how those choices reflect the sentiments of its community. We strongly support students and other affiliates holding their universities accountable for inviting speakers that reflect the values of their community. We extend this support to our peers at Concordia.
Mansfield has had a well known legacy of defending controversial views, such as through supporting a Colorado state amendment preventing protected status based on sexual orientation, and writing an op-ed arguing that the prevalence of “rape culture” on college campuses is actually a “hook-up culture” stemming from a lack of “feminine modesty.” As our Board opined over two decades ago, and as we still believe today, comments along these lines — be they racialized, gendered, or homophobic — are heinous and do not reflect the values of the wider Harvard community. While Mansfield has been invited to speak at prestigious events since then, such as delivering the National Endowment for the Humanities’ 2007 Jefferson Lecture, we must recognize that autonomous institutions are entitled to unique evaluations of a speaker’s merit in the particular context of their community. Just as Mansfield’s personal views do not preclude him from scholarship, nor should the backlash from his public and political stances be shielded by academic clout.
Mansfield claims roughly a dozen Concordia alumni approached members of the faculty to voice concerns about his historical stances on women and people who identify as BGLTQ — opinions which he described as “conservative” but “nothing outlandish.” While Mansfield has every right to write about his perspectives in his books and op-eds, he should be cognizant about how these views are generally rebuffed by academia. Moreover, he should not necessarily conflate all of his views with conservatism at large, which encompasses a multifaceted spectrum of beliefs and values.
Visiting speakers are a vital part of the discourse we belief makes our community so powerful, but so too are responses and protests. Just as we affirm the right of everyone to make themselves heard, we affirm the right of institutions and their constituent community members to choose what sorts of perspectives they wish to give audience to. In our own campus’s moment of increased student activism, students should continue to voice their opinions on the merits of these speakers.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Division of Continuing Education has partnered with eight universities from around the world to develop a shared infrastructure standard for digitally verifying academic credentials in a project called Digital Credentials announced last week.
Along with Harvard, other participating universities include MIT and the University of California, Berkeley, as well as institutions from Germany, Mexico, Canada, and the Netherlands.
Currently, students have to manually contact their former institutions to verify the academic credentials they earned, including transcripts, certificates, and other documentation confirming course completion. The collaborative initiative seeks to create a better system for managing records of student academic achievements. The Division of Continuing Education encompasses various undergraduate, graduate, and non-degree programs and is leading the program at Harvard.
Henry H. Leitner, chief innovation officer for the division, said a global collaboration is necessary to set a standard system for storing and verifying academic credentials. He described the current system as “somewhat cumbersome” and “prone to fraud.”
“Without a shared infrastructure, the usefulness of doing this individually is going to be quite limited. You really need to have collaboration with lots and lots of universities,” Leitner said.
“You want to have degrees, diplomas, certificates — basically credentials — that are tamper proof, that are secure, that are independent of any, you know, third party vendor,” he added.
Though the University as a whole is interested in the project, Leitner said it was especially applicable to the Division of Continuing Education's programs since they offer various non-degree options. For example, participants in professional development programs — which take place over the course of just a few days — are given a credential of participation, but at the moment there is no simple way to electronically record that, according to Leitner.
Leitner said that the Digital Credentials team plans to focus on creating “a solid, ethical standard for verifying academic credentials.” The standard would eventually provide a roadmap for developers to use in designing technology that will allow students to access their credentials.
With this new technology, students will also be able to compile credentials from multiple institutions and safely store this information using a streamlined process. Participating institutions are experimenting with blockchain to bring this project to fruition.
Joshua V. Boyd, a degree-seeking Harvard Extension School student, said the idea of an application that would securely store his academic credentials sounded useful for students.
“As long as they have an internet signal, they can access the app and pull up the files, which is, to me, awesome,” Boyd said.

The FBI is involved in investigating a racist and threatening email sent to members of Harvard Business School’s African American Student Union in late March, according to a student who received the email.
These emails, sent on March 28, contained racial slurs and threats of violence against 18 members of the AASU board. Business School Dean Nitin Nohria sent an email to students in the school’s MBA program the following day condemning the emails and assuring students that authorities believe that no students were in physical danger. He added that an investigation was underway.
“We have taken immediate steps, including to notify the police, and we are doing everything we can to support our students and to learn more about the incident,” Nohria wrote in the March 29 email. “Our initial assessment is that there is no concern of direct physical harm to any member of our community, but we are investigating the matter fully.”
Nohria also wrote about the need for the larger Business School community to support the AASU in the aftermath of the incident.
“Hate speech and hate crimes threaten our shared humanity. When an act such as this is aimed at our campus, it is important that we stand in solidarity and reaffirm the values we hold dear,” Nohria wrote. “I hope you will join me in reaffirming and ensuring that Harvard Business School is a place where every individual is respected and honored.”
Kel Jackson, the outgoing conference co-director for the AASU, said that the message appears to have originated in a foreign country.
“The thing that has been consistent is that they do not expect any imminent physical threat associated with this email,” Jackson said. “They have assured us of that multiple times… They being campus police, HBS, Harvard security — have been in touch with the FBI and other law enforcement entities.”
Harvard University Police Department Spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the investigation, referring to the department’s policy not to comment on open cases. An FBI spokesperson did not confirm or deny any involvement in the investigation, per its policies.
Jackson said AASU was pleased with the administration’s “immediate and impactful” emailed response to the threatening emails. The administration also announced it would hold a luncheon the following week to discuss the incident and larger issues of race at the school.
“Speaking for myself and others I can remember reacting, folks appreciated...the seriousness of the intent and the speed with which it was executed,” Jackson said.
A number of business school students said they also appreciate the urgency with which the school responded. Business School student Bijan Darko, who did not receive the email but knows people who did, said he is also pleased with the administration’s support of those directly impacted by the email.
“I personally thought that it was very good,” Darko said. “They got on top of it very quickly, they allowed us to tell and inform the class what happened. And actually class time was taken out for it so we could inform everyone and discuss,” he said.
“From what I understand, they have been very supportive of the AASU board,” he added.
Jackson said most students were surprised by the incident, and he said that no one expected it to happen at Harvard.
“People were alarmed, I think, is an accurate word in terms of ‘holy cow somebody made death threats to people here like,’ ‘wait what's going on, oh there was a racist component.’ People were just shocked by that,” Jackson said.
Business School student Eileen Sullivan said that one of the most shocking elements of the incident was that it happened in 2019.
“Its 2019 and we are still living in a world where people are still getting messages like that, which is pretty awful,” she said.
Clarification: May 1, 2019
A previous version of this article stated that Kel Jackson said AASU was pleased with the administration's response to the threatening emails. To clarify, Jackson was referring to the administration's email to all students following the threatening emails.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of accepted students flooded campus Saturday through Monday for Visitas, the College's annual weekend of programming for admitted students.
The weekend opened with an address from University President Lawrence S. Bacow on Saturday afternoon to welcome admitted students. Earlier in the day, admitted students milled about Harvard Square and went on tours of campus, labs, and libraries. Many also watched the annual Institute of Politics debate.
Most prospective students stayed with current students in freshman dorms and upperclassman houses.
Sanjana Singh, an admitted student from Northern Virginia, said one of her favorite parts of the weekend was meeting her host.
“She was really approachable and really helped me learn about the really good parts of Harvard you don’t get introduced to just on tours,” Singh said. “I really learned a lot and it made me really like Harvard.”
For other students, housing wasn’t a highlight of the weekend.
“I woke up on the first morning and saw a centipede on the floor,” Troy Powell, an admitted student from New Jersey, said. “I didn’t sleep easy the second night.”
One popular event was the annual ‘Visitas Palooza,’ a two-hour show featuring student performances. Singh said The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers’ performance was “really cool.”
On Sunday afternoon, crowds of admitted students attended the activities fair in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. More than 100 student organizations set up booths for the fair held each year and did their best to court prospective students.
“The extracurricular fair was great,” Gia-Han Le, an admitted student from Massachusetts, said. “I think it was definitely an explosion of Harvard.”
Richard K. Darkwa, another admitted student from Massachusetts, said he thought the event was "very chaotic.”
“I didn’t think there was that much of a variety, either,” he said of the clubs represented at the fair. “I saw a lot of politics, a lot of music stuff. It was overwhelming.”
Darkwa said the most informative event of the weekend was a panel of current students and faculty entitled "What It’s Like to Be a First Year."
For Le, her high point of the weekend was ‘Visitas Thinks Big,’ where four faculty members shared presentations about their scholarship.
“They were all very amazing and personable and they each had a different aspect. You could tell they thought big, just in different ways,” she said. “It gave me a glimpse into what Harvard had to offer.”
Other academic programming included open houses with various concentrations, as well as opportunities for admitted students to attend classes on Monday.
Admitted students have until Wednesday to inform the College of their decision whether or not to attend Harvard.
Le called the choice to hold Visitas so close to the national deadline of May 1 a “power move.”
“I’m freaking out,” Singh added. “I just want more time.”

Astronomy Department Chair and Professor Avi Loeb teamed up with an undergraduate to identify the first interstellar meteor ever reported in our solar system.
A forthcoming paper describing the finding is co-authored by Loeb and Astrophysics concentrator Amir Siraj ’21.
The meteor in question burned up in earth’s atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on Jan. 8, 2014, according to Siraj. He and Loeb found it five years later in a United States military database, which has recorded more than 700 meteor impacts from the past three decades.
The meteor stood out because it was traveling extraordinarily fast — 60 kilometers per second relative to the average velocity of nearby stars, according to Siraj. The duo inferred the meteor’s trajectory from its speed and concluded that it must have originated from a neighboring star.
“The idea is to extrapolate its trajectory back in time,” Loeb said. “The only way to create such a high speed is if the object was produced in the inner part of a planetary system — because only in the inner part are the speeds around the star high enough to eject things so rapidly.”
“It turns out the area where an object could be ejected at such a high speed — it would have to be orbiting very close to the star,” Siraj added. “In fact, it would have to be orbiting closer than the orbit of Mercury is to our star.”
The meteor’s discovery is particularly noteworthy because it could support the theory of panspermia — the possibility that life can be transferred from one planet to another.
To fly off at 60 kilometers per second, the meteor must have orbiting its star within what is the habitable zone of most stars.
“People suggested maybe that life started earlier on Mars than on Earth, when it had an atmosphere, and then was brought to Earth from Mars in one of these rocks. So that’s the simplest version of transfer of life,” Loeb said. “But you could imagine also the transfer of life between stars — planets around different stars.”
“It’s like a message in a bottle,” Loeb added.
The only requirement is that this life-transferring rock would have to have been sufficiently large to avoid burning up in the atmosphere, according to Loeb.
Siraj and Loeb estimate that interstellar meteors should strike Earth every ten years on average. One large enough to preserve life would prove even more rare.
The discovery of the meteor comes in the wake of subsiding publicity surrounding Oumuamua, the first interstellar object ever recorded. The unidentifiable object’s unlikely pancake-like geometry prompted Loeb’s suggestion — for which he drew some censure among colleagues — that it could be an alien probe.
Loeb said he is urging his fellow astronomers to pay attention to meteors traveling at “very unusual speeds,” lest they prove to be “debris of some defunct equipment from another civilization.”
“I don’t want us to have a prejudice,” he said. “A lot of people have a problem. They think they know the answer in advance.”
He added that a lack of “prejudice” is why he enjoys working with an undergraduate, like Siraj, who is a “clean slate” and still “thinks creatively.”
“I’m just really excited about discovering more about interstellar objects and figuring out new ways to detect them,” Siraj said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) discussed transitioning from the corporate world to politics and President Donald Trump’s foreign policy at an Institute of Politics event Monday evening.
More than 70 people attended Corker’s conversation with Belfer Center Director and former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, which was entitled “Reflections on a Life of Leadership.” Carter said he invited Corker to speak near the end of the school year because this is often the time that many people are thinking about where to go next in their lives.
Corker opened the discussion with a detailed account of his career journey, from owning a construction company to being elected to public office. He called public service “absolutely phenomenal” and encouraged audience members to consider it “at some juncture in life.”
“I did not come from a family that ever thought about being in the political arena, but my life has been enriched,” he said.
After two terms, Corker decided not to run for re-election last year despite holding powerful positions in the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chair. Considered by many to be a moderate Republican, Corker repeatedly spoke out against Trump’s policy decisions in his final two years in office.
Corker said his decision to leave the Senate was not because he was disillusioned with politics, but because he promised Tennesseans before entering office that he would serve only two terms.
Throughout his time in office, Corker was known for bringing together politicians from both sides of the aisle. Corker said the “extremes driving the primaries” in past elections are not necessarily reflective of the “civility” he saw in the halls of Congress.
“Washington more closely reflects the American people than they would like to wish,” Corker said.
He did, however, characterize Trump as a “populist” and said Trump “purposely, as a governing model, is dividing.”
“To purposefully undermine the institutions of government for your own strengthening of your political standing is just foreign to me,” Corker said.
Carter said he hopes the 2020 presidential election will be a “real debate on solving problems,” and holding a Republican primary despite Trump being an incumbent might be “useful” to this end.
“Otherwise I think it could end up being an extremely low level race where there’s no real discussion about solving problems,” Corker said.
Shantel Hebert-Magee, a research fellow at the School of Public Health who attended the talk, said that it was important to hear Corker’s perspective at Harvard and in Boston, which both tend to skew liberal.
“To get someone who is a conservative to speak on issues and know their optics and viewpoints, I think it’s important in order for us to have any kind of meaningful discussion,” she said.
Hebert-Magee added that she agreed with some of Corker’s views, but disagreed in particular with his assessment that American politics today is truly representative of the people.
“From his perspective, he may think that it is reflective of the majority,” she said. “I don’t necessarily agree with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seniors seeking Latin honors at graduation in May will likely face climbing grade point average cutoffs.
Students in the Class of 2018 needed to earn a 3.62 GPA to qualify for “cum laude,” the lowest level of Latin honors. A student graduating in the Class of 2009, however, only needed to earn a 3.448 overall GPA to be eligible for the same distinction. The “magna cum laude” honor had a cutoff of 3.844 for the Class of 2018 and one of 3.721 for members of the Class of 2009.
The College uses a two-tiered system to determine who receives Latin honors. First, academic departments recommend a set of students to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. FAS then bestows Latin honors using a cutoff set each year to ensure the proportion of students earning honors at different levels remains steady.
To determine who is recommended for honors, some departments weigh thesis grades, GPAs, and oral exam results; others simply use internal GPA thresholds.
FAS then determines College-wide GPA cutoffs for Latin honors each year. Students who were not recommended for Latin honors may receive a “cum laude for the overall record” qualification based solely on their grades.
Government Director of Undergraduate Studies Nara Dillon pointed to grade inflation at the College as the cause of rising cutoffs. As of 2013, an A- was the median grade awarded to undergraduates.
“It’s definitely grade inflation,” Dillon said. “It's gotten very hard, for example, to figure out who to nominate for Phi Beta Kappa and for summa, because we have quite a few students with terrific GPAs. So it makes very small differences stand out at that level.”
The magna cum laude and overall cum laude honors — which have the same cutoffs — have seen a rising GPA requirement since at least the Class of 2009.
A 2002 Faculty vote set 60 percent as the maximum portion of each class that can earn honors. That policy change aimed to make Latin honors more exclusive — more than 90 percent of the Class of 2004 graduated with honors.
In 2012, FAS capped the number of students who may receive summa cum laude honors at five percent of the graduating class. Roughly the next 15 percent and 30 percent receive magna cum laude and cum laude, respectively. No more than 10 percent may receive cum laude overall degrees.
Still, students often have several thresholds to cross before FAS even considers whether to award them honors. Computer Science co-Director of Undergraduate Studies Stephen N. Chong said his department uses several “filters” to select candidates.
“The concentration GPA is one filter, the other one is the excellent or outstanding thesis, and so you need both of those in order to qualify for high honors or for highest honors,” Chong said.
Other departments use different weighting schemes — splitting credit between thesis grades and the concentration GPA — to recommend students for honors. The Government department weights concentration grades to thesis grades two-to-one. The Psychology department uses a similar formula, approved by its faculty in 1981.
FAS has not yet published GPA cutoffs for Latin honors for the Class of 2019 — they typically do so in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted Monday to pass an order endorsing student activists’ demands for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
Divest Harvard organizers worked in conjunction with the Mayor’s Office to develop the order, which was sponsored by Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Vice Mayor Jan Devereux, Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui, and Councilor Quinton Zondervan. The order’s language puts the “full support” of the City Council behind Divest Harvard, a student group advocating for the University to withdraw its endowment holdings from fossil fuels.
In a press release, Divest Harvard wrote that they are “proud” to have the support of the City of Cambridge.
“It is up to us as members of Cambridge and as global citizens to fight for our futures and for the wellbeing of our communities who will [be] hit the hardest by the climate crisis, who are disproportionately poor communities and communities of color,” the press release said. “Today, our vision goes beyond a more just and stable Harvard; it is for a more just and stable world that we are mobilizing on campus and beyond.”
This resolution is the not the first time that the city government has involved itself with Harvard students’ divestment movement. On Friday, McGovern spoke at a rally in Harvard Yard hosted by Divest Harvard, where he called on the University “to do more and to do better.” The rally was the culmination of “Heat Week” — a week of speakers and events pressuring Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry.
The order details several of Divest Harvard’s demands on the University, including fully divesting by Earth Day 2020, disclosing Harvard’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry, and the reinvestnting in “environmentally sustainable” funds. The order also urges Harvard to withdraw their land holdings around the world.
Ariel G. Silverman ’22, a member of Divest Harvard’s parent organization Harvard Undergraduates for Environmental Justice, made a public comment during the City Council meeting in which she thanked McGovern and the City Council for their support.
“This kind of leadership is the leadership we need to see from Harvard,” Silverman said.
Divestment activism has taken over Harvard’s campus in recent months. Members of Divest Harvard as well as the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign — a group advocating for the University to divest from companies tied to the prison industry — have led protests throughout the school, released petitions that have garnered support from a range of Harvard affiliates, and met with Bacow himself.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an email to The Crimson that he has no further comment beyond the University’s previous statements.
In response to these increasing protests, Bacow has publicly and privately maintained that the endowment is not a mechanism for social change. He has also reiterated that the University must engage with the fossil fuel industry to prevent worsening impacts of climate change.
Zondervan, a city councilor, said he hopes Harvard will take the City’s order into consideration.
“We are the elected representatives from the people of Cambridge,” Zondervan said. “So when we agree on a resolution like that, we're essentially speaking to the entire community in saying that we do or don't want something so now, hopefully, now Harvard will take that into account.”

More than 50 College students received rainbow stoles and tassels Monday evening at Harvard’s Lavender Graduation — an annual commencement ceremony to honor the achievements of BGLTQ graduating seniors.
The Office of BGLTQ Student Life held the event at the Student Organization Center at Hilles, which was decorated in various purple hues — a nod to the significance of the color lavender in BGLTQ history. The ceremony marked the sixth time Harvard has hosted Lavender Graduation, which was first held in 2013.
Sheehan D. Scarborough, the director of the Office of BGLTQ Student life, opened the event with remarks about the challenges of being a BGLTQ student at the College.
“For those of you who have had to fight for your sense of belonging, this ceremony is for you,” he said. “For those of you who found yourselves having to do as much teaching as you did learning, this ceremony is for you.”
Before the distribution of rainbow tassels in an official procession, Ming Li Wu ’21 performed a spoken word poem and Aisha Moodie-Mills — a resident fellow at the Institute of Politics and BGLTQ activist — delivered a speech about individuality and resilience.
“What really, really matters at the end of the day is not necessarily the tactical, but the emotional. And how you lead with passion in everything that you do, no matter what that is,” Moodie-Mills said in her remarks.
Though Lavender Graduation only began at Harvard six years ago, colleges and universities nationwide have held the ceremony since 1995, when it was first held at the University of Michigan. The event has expanded significantly since its inception at Harvard, Scarborough said in an interview before the event.
“There were only about ten to 15 students who participated [in 2013],” he said. “We’re at about 60 students participating in Lavender Graduation in some way or another this year. So, it’s just growing every year.”
Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus President Kamille D. Washington ’10 conducted the ceremony, praising the growth of the event and support services for BGLTQ students since her graduation from the College.
“We have been so excited at the HGSC to see how this event has grown,” Washington said in an interview before the event. “For me, when I graduated in 2010, there was no Office of BGLTQ Life when I graduated so it’s really heartwarming to see this program exists.”
Amelia M. Lamp ’19 and Luke. A. Martinez ’19, who participated in Lavender Graduation, said they appreciated the continued tradition of ceremony at Harvard to cap their college careers.
“This is really cool for me, because I wasn’t totally out most of my college career,” Lamp said. “Doing this was really nice because it is finally kind of experiencing the queer community. It’s great to hang out with lovely and supportive people.”
“This is just a wonderful installment in the life of the Harvard queer community,” Martinez said. “I hope people take this as an invitation to do more.”

Jonathan L. Walton, the Minister of Memorial Church and a professor at Harvard Divinity School, will leave the University at the end of this academic year to serve as the next dean of Wake Forest University School of Divinity, Walton announced Sunday.
Walton has spent nine years at Harvard and seven as minister. Prior to Harvard, Walton worked at Princeton University and University of California, Riverside.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates Monday morning that Walton’s upcoming departure is bittersweet.
“Jonathan has dramatically altered spiritual life at Harvard through leadership infused with compassion and love,” Bacow wrote.
During his time at Harvard, Walton occupied a number of roles. In addition to teaching and holding his Memorial Church post, Walton serves on the Administrative Board of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the General Education Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty Committee on Athletics, and the University Task Force on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging. He also chaired the Harvard College Working Group on Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging under former University President Drew G. Faust.
Walton has also frequently spoken out for social justice on campus. In September 2017, Walton was among a group of Harvard professors arrested during a protest against President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind protections for undocumented individuals brought to the United States as children. He also designated Memorial Church a “sanctuary” space for Harvard affiliates who are undocumented after Trump’s election in December 2016 and demanded gun control reform during morning prayers.
Walton wrote in an emailed statement that he looks forward to working with students who care about social justice on Wake Forest’s campus. Walton wrote that its graduates are on the “front lines” of social justice efforts throughout the country and particularly in the South.
“We know that in diverse southern cities and multiethnic rural communities, the language of social justice is not just an academic exercise,” Walton wrote. “It is life or death for clergy and activists on the front lines fighting against racial and religious bigotry, sexism, homophobia, and economic inequality.”
Walton leaves behind a legacy of physical changes at Harvard, in addition to his contributions to the prayer community.
While Walton was at its helm, Memorial Church underwent renovations in 2016 that transformed the basement into a “student oasis” space open to Harvard students and organizations.
Benjamin "Ben" Schafer ’19, a student, mentee, and friend of Walton’s, said Walton really tried to “make Harvard a home.”
For every home Harvard football game, Professor Walton hosted a tailgate on the front lawn of his house in Cambridge where he purposefully invited student groups that would never have interacted with each other otherwise, according to Schafer.
“It was an incredible experience of seeing how someone with so much influence was able to open up his home and the resources that he had to the community and create a welcoming space,” Schafer said.
Correction: May 1, 2019
A previous version of this article misspelled Benjamin Schafer's name. 
Correction: May 1, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Schafer said several student groups never would have interacted with Jonathan Walton if he hadn't invited him to tailgates at his house. In fact, Schafer said the student groups never would have interacted with each other without Walton's invitations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a dozen students have launched a letter-writing campaign in support of Associate Professor of Romance Languages and Literature and History and Literature Lorgia Garcia Peña’s bid for tenure.
The students’ efforts come in the wake of the departures of three tenure-track professors who specialize in Ethnic Studies in recent months — each of which sparked outcry from students and alumni. Faculty members with knowledge of the tenure process say student activism for Garcia Peña could play a role in the ultimate tenure decision.
Adelson Aguasvivas ’21, a Dominican Student Association board member who helped organize the campaign, said he and other students decided to support Garcia Peña because of her representation and mentorship of Latinx and Afro-Latinx students on campus.
“She really took me in,” Aguasvivas said. “Not only did she do this for me, but she would do it for all of the kids that were in the Hist and Lit department and the Romance Languages department.”
“She will usually try to make a personal connection with each one of them, which I think is something that's usually rare from professors,” he added.
In November, the Harvard Graduate School of Education decided not to put Associate Professor of Education Natasha K. Warikoo up for tenure, and in February, Assistant Professor of History Genevieve A. Clutario accepted a position at Wellesley College. In response, three student and alumni groups sent letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and held a rally decrying the professors’ departures and calling for a formalized Ethnic Studies program.
Earlier this month, Harvard Divinity School denied tenure to Associate Professor Ahmed Ragab, prompting hundreds of students and alumni to sign letters criticizing the decision. The students pointed to Ragab’s work in Muslim studies — a field which they said is underrepresented at the University — as well as his teaching and mentorship of minority students.
DSA President Noelle V. Castro ’22 said the departure of the other scholars in part inspired the letter-writing campaign on behalf of Garcia Peña.
“I think it's very unfortunate that professors of color who are providing representation for communities of color here are being denied tenureship,” Castro said.
University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the students’ efforts, writing in an emailed statement that she is unable to discuss individual tenure cases. She pointed instead to the FAS Tenure-Track Handbook, which lists teaching, including advising, as a “critical factor” in the tenure decision. The handbook does not explicitly list student letters of support as a factor in a candidate’s promotion decision.
The potential impact of the students’ ongoing campaign is unclear, according to multiple faculty members who have served on tenure committees in the past. English Professor Louis Menand, a past witness on multiple ad hoc committees, wrote in an email that student input is “taken into account” but is far from the only metric that the committee weighs.
“The decision is a mix, obviously, not one thing,” he wrote.
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote in an email that tenure review committees attempt to incorporate undergraduate input while also preserving the importance of research and other criteria.
“There are protocols in the tenure review process for gathering information from students,” Lewis wrote. “Of course it is done in a way that does not incentivize faculty to make themselves popular at the expense of educational quality.”
Direct lobbying in support of a prospective tenured faculty member, while unusual, is not unprecedented, according to English Professor James Simpson.
Castro said the group will continue to accept letters advocating for Garcia Peña through April 30.
“I just feel inspired by the things that she does for our community and the representation that she provides, which is why I'm so motivated to support her in any way that I can,” she said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow honored 16 grant recipients of the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund — a program that supports neighborhood improvement projects and educational programming for Allston-Brighton residents — at a ceremony Monday afternoon.
The event took place at the Harvard Ed Portal, a Harvard service initiative in Allston, where Bacow delivered remarks on the importance of collaboration between Allston, Boston, and Harvard.
Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh was originally slated to speak at the event, but was unable to attend due to a traffic accident on the Massachusetts Turnpike, according to Vice President for Communications and Public Affairs Paul Andrew, who delivered opening remarks.
Since its inception in 2008, HAPF has provided $1.1 million in grants to local nonprofits, according to a press release. The program reached the $1 million milestone in grants last year.
This year, HAPF recipients included the Boston String Academy — an organization that provides musical instruction to youth — and The Fishing Academy — an organization that runs fishing lessons.
In his remarks, Bacow said that the fund has provided 118 grants to 35 “community partners” over the last 11 years.
“We all need to work together, and I think this partnership is a great opportunity to do it,” Bacow said.
Bacow’s remarks come as Harvard is preparing for its long-awaited move into Allston by September 2020. Bacow told the grant recipients that Harvard is “committed” to collaborations with Allston residents.
“We at Harvard are committed to collaborations that serve and strengthen the community, that try and help our neighbors. We try to be a good neighbor ourselves,” Bacow said. “I'm grateful to everybody in this room, who have helped to create a model that works. Your commitment, and the goodwill that it generates, is really essential to our future.”
Grant recipient John Woods, the executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, spoke after Bacow, during which he said the grant would provide funding for more “targeted outreach to targeted areas” in Allston-Brighton. The Allston-Brighton CDC supports financial counseling and home-buying programs in the neighborhood.
After Woods spoke, Bacow distributed framed certificates to grant recipients, which also included the CommonWheels Bicycle Co-Op — a program that teaches adults and children how to ride and repair bikes.
In an interview after the ceremony, Jessica B. Robertson, the treasurer of CommonWheels said the funding from the grant allows the nonprofit to hire more staff.
“Harvard has funded us for a couple of years now and we're a very small organization. This grant will provide a really important piece of the funding that allows us to hire staff and deliver these programs,” Robertson said. “So we really wouldn't be able to do our programs without it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the bottom of the 14th inning in a 9-9 game against Columbia (17-19, 12-6 Ivy) when junior outfielder Jake Suddleson stepped up to the plate. After five straight scoreless innings, and with senior first baseman Patrick McColl on base, Suddleson was poised to break the tie and take home the win for the Crimson (23-11, 12-6).
And with one swing of the bat, that’s what he did.
“It was crazy,” McColl said. “It was pretty awesome for Jake to come in clutch like that at home.”
A line drive almost to the wall in the right-center gap sent McColl sprinting around the bases from first and sliding into the plate with the throw just a bit late.
“When he hit the ball, I turned and looked to make sure that no one was going to get to it,” commented McColl, the Los Altos, Calif., native. “As soon as I made that decision, I took off and there was no way that I was stopping.”
As the team stormed out of the dugout to mob Suddleson at second base, he threw up both hands in euphoria.
“As soon as I scored, I think Chase Aldridge was there at home, and we took off running towards left field,” added McColl, who also currently boasts the second best batting average in the nation at .430. “The whole team ran to just chase down Jake.”
The walk-off double cemented the series victory against the Lions and capped off an overall offensive battle between the two teams. The slugfest started in the first two innings, where Columbia put up six runs and kept Harvard scoreless. Harvard put up three runs in the third, with senior outfielder Ben Skinner and junior infielder Quinn Hoffman contributing RBI extra base hits and Suddleson knocking one in with a sacrifice fly.
The Lions put up two more in the top of the sixth and seventh innings, each coming from a solo home run. In the bottom of the seventh, though, the Crimson exploded for a six run inning, led by an RBI double from McColl and home runs from sophomore catcher Matt Thomas and Suddleson himself.
Columbia retaliated with a run in the top of the eighth, tying the game at nine runs apiece. The game was kept scoreless from the ninth inning through the thirteenth due to a dominant performance from the Harvard bullpen on the mound. After senior starter Ian Miller left the contest, freshman Harrison Stovern entered and saw two and two thirds innings of work. Stovern yielded for sophomore Enzo Stefanoni, who added another two innings, after which freshman James Kirkpatrick and senior James Forte each contributed an inning.
“Once we got to extras, it was a battle to see who could last longer,” McColl said. “Our pitchers did an amazing job coming out — a bunch of great things were going on.”
On Saturday, Harvard split a doubleheader against Columbia to open the series. They dropped game one 11-9 to Columbia in another back-and-forth shootout, with extra bass hits coming from Skinner, Suddleson, freshman infielder Hunter Bigge, and senior Trent Bryan. After the tough loss, though, the team picked up a tight game two with a score of 6-4, propelled by extra base hits from Skinner, senior catcher Devan Peterson, and sophomore infielder Buddy Mrowka.
However, the focus of the weekend was on Sunday and the Crimson seniors. It was fitting that the Crimson took home the ballgame and the series in such an electric fashion, as Sunday was the team’s senior day on O’Donnell Field.
“It was definitely an emotional day for some guys,” said McColl, himself in the final season wearing a Crimson uniform. “Knowing that’s the last regulation game we seniors played on O’Donnell Field made the way we won especially memorable for us.”
The seniors were able to reflect upon what the program has meant to them over the years as they were celebrated for their commitment to Harvard Baseball. Sunday was a truly meaningful day for all involved.
“It’s been a long four years of playing baseball out on this field,” McColl offered. “For me, I was standing out on first base and just taking it all in. And to be able to score the winning run made it a day I’ll never forget.”
And as they looked in the rearview mirror, the senior ballplayers were also able to look forward at the conclusion of one of the most fruitful seasons in recent memory. Harvard moved into a tie with Columbia for first place in the Ancient Eight standings — and the series win just gave them the tiebreaker. The the final conference matchup against Brown will determine the team’s fate and chances at an Ivy League championship in which the Crimson might very well encounter the Lions again.
“This was a really big one for us,” McColl said. “It was a good series in general — all the games were tight and super intense. Hopefully this was just a precursor to what will end up being the Ivy League championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard track and field prepares for Ivy Heps next weekend, part of the team competed at the Stonehill Invite while others competed at the Penn Relays for a final tune-up before one of the biggest meets of the season. The Crimson continued their success, winning three events, and placing top five in five others. With the promising results from this past weekend, Harvard finds itself in a strong position to defeat their Ancient Eight foes.
“We're using all these different meets as opportunities to prepare for the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships in Princeton in May, where we hope to improve on our 2nd place finish (women) and 3rd place finish (men) from the indoor championships” said freshman sprinter Max Serrano-Wu. “There were many PR's set this weekend, so we'll reflect on our performance and use it as a boost for the Championships.”
The Belmont, Mass. native had a significant contribution to the Crimson’s success this past weekend at the Stonehill Invite. He competed in the 400m and crossed the finish line in fifth place, posting a time of 52.20 seconds. As Ivy Heps approaches, the freshman sprinter hopes to edge closer to the 50 second threshold he has been vying for this entire season.
The 400m race also saw freshman Mason Rodriguez get fourth with a time of 51.69 seconds. If Rodriguez and Serrano-Wu can continue to lower down their times, they will provide valuable depth to a sprinting lineup that already boast the best 4x400m in the Ivy League.
Other notable performances for Harvard come from the middle distance runners. Senior Liam Hackett placed fourth in the 800m at the Stonehill Invite with a time of 1:56.78. His leadership along with senior captain Myles Marshall, the reigning 800m Ivy Heps Champion, will be crucial in order to secure points in the middle distance events come next weekend.
The highlight of the weekend comes from both the men’s and women’s distance teams, who excelled at the Stonehill Invite and Penn Relays respectively. The Stonehill Invite saw junior Charlie Davis win the 3000m steeplechase with a time of 10:20.08 while at Penn, freshman David Melville earned a new personal record with 9:23.14 in the 3000m steeplechase. Sophomore Michael Alber would win the 3000m at the Stonehill Invite in 8:50.50.
On the women’s side, there were a slew of personal bests and one incredible school record to boast. Junior Lisa Tertsch finished second in the women’s 5000m at Penn Relays with a time 16:03.15. Her time was the fastest by a collegiate student-athlete at the meet and broke the school record by over eight seconds, surpassing Morgan Kelly ‘14’s time of 16:11.05. Such a dominant performance at one of the most competitive meets in the nation bodes well for Tertsch at Ivy Heps.
Along with Tertsch’s impressive school record performance, the women’s distance runners also succeeded at the 3000m, 5000m, 10000m. In her first time running the 3000m, sophomore Tessa Medrano placed 13th at the event with a time of 9:54.19.
In the 5000m, junior Brooke Starn broke her personal record by over 20 seconds with a time of 16:55.04 and placed 18th in the event. Finally, Gillian Meeks exceeded her personal best by over 30 seconds in the 10000m to place 6th in the event with a time of 34:59.33. Her time was the 10th best mark in program history.
With excellent performances by the distance team this past weekend, the Crimson should be encouraged heading into Ivy Heps next weekend. Both the mens and womens team will need their distance runners to perform at their best if they want to take home the chip.

The courtyard and galleries will be open for studying, or take a break with a student-led tour or a virtual reality sketching session!
As the libraries and study spaces around campus fill up and the deadlines loom closer, don’t forget to take a breather every now and then. And hey, when free food is on the table, you might as well take it.
