After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 12:25 p.m.
Former Harvard Law School Dean Elena Kagan will begin today the week-long process of confirmation hearings for her nomination to the Supreme Court.
The hearings, which will be conducted by the United States Senate Judiciary Committee, are set to start Monday at 12:30 p.m., marking the second time the former Solicitor General has appeared before the committee for a confirmation hearing in a little over a year.
According to the witness list released by the Senate Judiciary Committee, five Harvard affiliates will appear to testify as major witnesses during the hearings: Law School Professor and former dean Robert C. Clark, Law School Professor Jack L. Goldsmith III, Law Lecturer and Winthrop House Master Ronald S. Sullivan, President of the Harvard Law Armed Forces Association Kurt White, and Massachusetts Appeals Court Judge and Law School graduate Fernande “Nan” Duffly.
Among the issues expected to be discussed is Kagan’s stance on military recruiting while she was dean of the Law School. Kagan’s critics—calling her "anti-military"—claim that she barred military recruiters from campus during her tenure as dean. But in the days leading up to today's hearings, the media has been abuzz about recently uncovered e-mails and documents released by the Department of Defense suggesting that Kagan did not prevent military recruiting, though she did bar recruiters from conducting interviews through the school’s career center.
The White House has been publicizing the endorsements of Kagan's advocates, such as a letter to two members of the Senate Judiciary Committee in which more than 60 deans at major American law schools—including current Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow—expressed their suport for Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court and wrote that she possessed all the "relevant dimensions desired in a Supreme Court justice." Last Tuesday, eight solicitors general signed a letter stating their belief that Kagan would "serve on the Court with distinction."
But some members of the Republican party say  that Kagan's denial of military recruiters' access to Harvard Law  School's career center and criticisms of military policies created an  unwelcome environment for recruiters.
"Instead of welcoming the  military recruiters on campus, she punished  them, relegating them to second-class status," Alabama  Republican Senator Jeff Sessions said in a statement. "Dean Kagan's  public comments contributed to a hostile on-campus  environment for both recruiters and student veterans alike."
If confirmed, the 1986 Harvard Law School graduate will join the ranks of five sitting Supreme Court justices who also graduated from the school. Kagan, who clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall and previously served as Solicitor General, would also be the first Justice since William H. Rehnquist without prior judicial experience and, at 50 years of age, the youngest Justice on the Court.
A successful confirmation process would make Kagan the second of President Barack Obama’s nominees to join the Supreme Court over a period of under two years. In May 2009, Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to replace retired Justice David Souter, and she was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A graduate of Harvard Kennedy School was arrested yesterday for allegedly spying on behalf of the Russian government in order to infiltrate U.S. policymaking circles.
The defendant, who is referred to in documents released by the U.S. Department of Justice as Donald Howard Heathfield, allegedly met with a U.S. government official involved with nuclear weapons research and was tasked with assembling data on U.S. foreign policy, including American policies regarding Central Asia, assessments of Russian foreign policy by Western nations, and the policies of the United States concerning Internet use by terrorists.
Heathfield—who received a master’s in public administration from the Kennedy School in 2000, according to the Harvard alumni directory—was arrested at his Trowbridge Street apartment by FBI agents, as was a woman listed in the Harvard directory as his spouse. This woman, referred to as Tracey Lee Ann Foley, does not appear to have any connection to the University.
Both Heathfield and Foley were charged with conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Together, the charges carry a maximum penalty of 25 years.
These arrests were part of a series of arrests across four states Sunday and were the product of a multi-year investigation by the FBI and other federal agencies into a program that officials believe was sanctioned by the SVR, the Russian foreign intelligence service.
Called the “Boston Conspirators” in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Heathfield and Foley are alleged to have met with a “former legislative counsel for US Congress” and a “member of faculty in economics.” The documents redacted the affiliation of the faculty member.
Additionally, Heathfield had allegedly been in contact with a former high-ranking national security official and had engaged in conversations regarding small-yield, high-penetration nuclear warheads. Throughout the time period, Heathfield and Foley were allegedly in regular communication with the SVR.
The documents make little indication of the true identities of Heathfield and Foley. Heathfield, who claimed to be a Canadian-born U.S. citizen, is believed to have assumed the name of someone who is now deceased. Prosecutors said in court documents that operatives often assume false identities and “will sometimes pursue degrees at target-country universities, obtain employment, and join relevant professional associations."
Spokespeople for the Kennedy School were not immediately available for comment. A University spokesman declined to comment late Monday evening.

As if throwing down celebrity television chef Bobby Flay wasn't enough, superstar baker Joanne B. Chang '91 recently opened her third branch of Flour Bakery.
Chang opened her first store in South End back in 2000, and the second in Fort Point Channel three years ago. The newest branch is located in Central Square on the way to MIT, much closer to her alma mater of Harvard.
In 2007, Chang appeared on "Throwdown with Bobby Flay," a Food Network show during which Flay challenges a chef in the latter's area of expertise. In Chang's case? Her signature sticky buns. As viewers crowded into Chang's Boston establishment (95 Harvard undergrads were invited to the filming), the sticky bun queen took down Flay and was declared the winner of the episode.
Chang, a former Leverett House resident, concentrated in applied math and economics while she was at Harvard, but after realizing that her post-undergraduate job as a management consultant wasn't exactly what she wanted to do, she opted for the logical alternative: opening a bakery.
Ten years and multiple television appearances later—not to mention a cookbook that will be released soon—Chang's signature sticky buns still go fast (they sadly flew by this Flyby correspondent since they only make a batch at 8 a.m. and a batch at noon).
But with the opening of the newest branch, these sticky delights will be much closer to campus and better within your reach.
