After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, over 200 Harvard University Band alums flocked to campus to celebrate its 90th anniversary, trumpets and French horns in hand. The weekend’s festivities, meant to recreate for grads the unique social and musical experience of being in the Band, included a number of events, such as the annual montage concert on Friday night in Sanders Theatre, the halftime show at the Saturday afternoon football game against Dartmouth, a post-game concert at Dillon Field House, and a special Sunday brunch in the band room.
When alums return for the Reunion Weekend, they don’t just sit on the sidelines—they often suit up and play alongside current members. “Some alums will watch the game from the stands, but about 150 chose to play with us,” notes Drill Master Bradley E. Oppenheimer ’10.
With so many alums returning to both watch and play in band events, it’s a wonder how  they all have instruments. “Many alums bring their own instruments,” explains Oppenheimer, “but for large instruments like the tuba or sousaphone, we contact area schools and ask to borrow them. For instance, this year, we borrowed instruments from the band departments at both MIT and [local high school] Cambridge Rindge and Latin. We have a good relationship with them, and borrow from them, just as we’d let them borrow from us.”
Band reunions, which take place every five years, always coincide with the annual Montage Concert, a centerpiece of the University Band and the subsidiary Wind Ensemble and Jazz Band. This year, the montage concert featured the Harvard Medley, a special arrangement of Harvard songs that was created by former Band Director and famous composer Leroy Anderson, the man behind the memorable holiday tune “Sleigh Ride.” The medley included such favorites as “Harvardiana,” “10,000 Men of Harvard,” and “Up the Street.”
The show also featured Dartmouth’s own musical medley, and a world premiere of a wind orchestra setting of the classic jazz song, “I Remember Clifford,” written by saxophonist Benny Golson. Thomas Everett, the Director of Band since 1971, was commissioned to arrange the Golson piece for a wind chamber group ensemble, and chose the occasion of the Montage concert to debut the piece.
The Harvard University Band is not only one of the largest student organizations on campus, but it is also one of the most tightly knit. “People have said that the Band is a social group first, and a musical group second,” Oppenheimer says. “That’s not to undermine the musical quality of what we do—it’s just to show how close the friendships are within Band.”
To illustrate this point, Oppenheimer tells an anecdote about one of band’s more dedicated alums. “We have one alum who graduated in the 1950s, and he has come to at least one football game per season for every year since”. As a much younger, contemporary band member, Anne S. Calkins ’10 agrees. “I love the community created from band,” Calkins says. “I knew I was joining Band before I even got to Harvard. I looked on their Web site and read their shows, and I thought this was going to be a great group to be a part of.”
Alums provide even more than social and moral support at games; they are also an important source of funding for the Band. According to Band Manager Alexander J. Ahmed ’10, “There is an alumni group called The Band Foundation, which funds some band activities. Every semester, we make financial requests and they decide whether or not they want to grant them,” he says. “For instance, this semester we asked for two new sousaphones and new speakers for the band room. Sometimes, directors will also ask for commissions for pieces for the Jazz Band and Wind Ensemble.”
With its blend of humor, musicality, and longstanding tradition, the Harvard University Band clearly holds a special place in the hearts of many. As the words of Prop Crew Manager William D. Ramsey ’12 well summarize: “I love Band because it is spontaneous, fun-loving and tradition-filled, without ever losing sight of the quality of the music.”

Sprawled on a couch, bloodshot eyes fixed on the screen, five hours into the third season: this is not the scene commonly associated with social responsibility. Yet this past Thursday, stars of the acclaimed HBO series “The Wire,” together with eminent Harvard professors, proposed that the poignant images of socio-political ills television can invoke are often the most powerful tools that can sensitize viewers. An event organized by the Department of African and African American Studies, the Boston Foundation, and the Ella J. Baker House, “The Wire at Harvard: Lessons for Policy and Politics,” served as a call to action to the show’s many fans.
The panel—led by African and African-American Studies professors Lawrence D. Bobo and William J. Wilson, Sonja Sohn (Detective Kima Greggs), Andre Royo (the lovable, troubled addict, Bubbles), and Michael K. Williams (the infamous ethical gangster, Omar Little)—praised the series for its refusal to simplify its characters and for its holistic portrayal of the social, political and economic forces acting on individuals at all levels of American society. “The Wire has done more to enhance understanding of systemic urban inequality than any published study by social scientists,” said Wilson, who will be teaching a course next year using “The Wire” as a frame for discussing poverty. Bobo echoed this sentiment, describing “The Wire” as “the single most important dramatic series of all time.” “In years to come, “The Wire” will be the authentic artistic chronicle of these times and conditions,” he said.
The stars, however, made clear that they were not here to congratulate themselves or “The Wire” but to draw the attention of Harvard students to the brutal realities that inspired the show’s storylines, which are more punishing now—in the midst of the financial crisis—than ever.
Sohn spoke compellingly of the nonprofit organization she founded with other cast members of “The Wire”; “ReWired for Change” works “to empower young people living in the most underserved communities across the country through education, media advocacy, and street-based intervention,” according to its website. She described working with communities in South Carolina in the run-up to the 2008 election, using the power of celebrity to urge the disaffected to use their vote. “We’re trying to make personal transformation hip,” she said.
The actors also emphasized that their investment in this work is as much personal as it is professional, alluding to their own childhoods in underprivileged communities. “I have not allowed this business to remove me from the hood. People in my hood [Brooklyn] are dying in huge numbers,” said Williams. “This is the real Wire”.
Charming the audience with his wit and humility, Royo referred to his own background. “This is the first time I’ve been affected like this. I can’t believe I’m walking around Harvard, sitting next to people with Professor in front of their name.” Williams was similarly moved, saying, “I feel so blessed. I can’t tell you how humbling this is.” But these sentiments only served to highlight the disparity between the experience of Harvard students and those of inner-city young people who lack opportunities. “These young people do not see success on this level,” Sohn said, “so they do not know that it exists.”
As well as offering emotional accounts of working with vulnerable young people in cities across the US, the panel suggested ways in which policy-making could address the problems raised by “The Wire.” Bobo spoke of the “the disastrous consequences of the war on drugs” and the need to reassess incarceration policy at a time when one in nine black men are in prison, often for crimes that would not have resulted in a jail term for a white person. “We need to ask ourselves, did it reduce crime? And did it make us all safer?”
Wilson spoke optimistically of the work done in Harlem Children’s Zone—a network of schools, health clinics and violence prevention programs serving the most poverty-stricken children in Harlem—which monitors children from elementary school through finding employment as an adult. He noted that the Obama administration plans to roll out similar schemes across 20 cities next year.
Ultimately, though, the evening served less as a talking shop and more as a call to action. The three actors were adamant that hands-on experience is necessary for anyone who wishes to understand the problems faced by young, vulnerable people in cities today. For them, this is nothing less than an ethical imperative. “There’s really no excuse for us not to go into these neighbourhoods and try to help out,” Sohn said.
Harvard students—oft considered future leaders of the world—have a crucial role to play in the initiative.  “One day some of you guys are going to be policy makers, business leaders, and heads of foundations,” Sohn said. “I challenge you to go into these communities and see what it is you’re trying to change. These circumstances won’t change if you do not answer the call.”

“Marat/Sade,” Peter Weiss’ violent, absurd, revolutionary drama, is both a wonder and headache. It’s a play within a play of the most perverse sort—the death of a radical written by a libertine and performed by lunatics; a thick weave of freedom and surveillance, change and identity brought together with a tense, gripping energy (and the occasional musical interlude). But it’s also a drama about events which took place 200 years ago driven by theories of theater half that age. One look at the show’s original 1963 title, “The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade,” should raise a flag: this is not a straightforward piece of writing.
So if the most recent Harvard production, directed by James M. Leaf ’10, never quite manages to yoke the bloody, staggering energy of the text, it mostly doesn’t matter; the resulting performance still fulfills the creepy, shaking nature of Weiss’ script. “Marat/Sade” is an apt and skilled production of a difficult and exciting play. It is unfortunate, though, that it sometimes overwhelms itself with the promise of its own potential.
The underlying story is fairly simple. Sickly with a skin disease, revolutionary leader Jean-Paul Marat (Mark A. Moody ’07) spent much of the revolution in a bathtub, writing pamphlets and soothing his sores until he was murdered by Charlotte Corday (Elyssa Jakim ’10). Performed in the insane asylum, the act’s unfolding is rich and nuanced. The cranky, nervous Marat is played by a paranoiac who at times must be detained because of his episodes; his words are twisted and debated by the cool and assured Marquis de Sade (Olivia J. Jampol ’10), who directs and occasionally intervenes in his own creation.
Such double-characters require skilled acting, and watching one identity leak out through another is a particular joy of this production. As both the resolute Charlotte Corday and the sleepy, hesitating inmate who plays her, Jakim manages her identity especially well. She forgets her lines with ease. The chorus also wavers deftly between unhappy inmates and unhappy poor, and their frequent off-tone songs keep the show from dragging.
Even the audience is asked to take on a double role. We are at once 1808 bourgeois intellectuals invited to witness the playacting of inmates and our own theatre-going selves, who watch both the play itself and the intellectuals’ reaction to it. This idea of surveillance and reaction comes from the text—Weiss was influenced by the theories of Bertolt Brecht, a German playwright who believed in politicizing theater by highlighting its artificiality—and Leaf uses it fully.
The lights remain half-lit for much of the performance, so that as the actors enact the “general copulation” of revolution or recreate the swift drop of the guillotine, the audience may look around and watch each other writhe.
At times, these moments are more silly than shocking, but when they work, Leaf causes the distress the play wants. Toward the middle of the play, Corday whips Sade under his own request. No real leather is used (Jakim sets her hair to the task), but Jampol’s grimaces and cries express such a mix of pain and pleasure that it is hard to believe that no one is getting hurt. Standing, arms and legs outstretched in the middle of the prison, she is at once physically bound and liberated in her speech. “Now I see where the revolution is leading—to the withering of individual Man, the slow merging to uniformity,” she says, echoing the pains of the war. I almost fell off my chair.
Unfortunately, some more subtle aspects of the script never fully rise to the surface. Marat and Sade’s long debate about the nature of mankind comes across as exactly that—a debate more arcane than compelling. Leaf has said that he wished to compare the two title characters rather than contrast them, as is normally done, but in doing so, he fails to exploit the text’s inherent strength. Marat and Sade are so physically different—one spends most of the play horizontal and infirm while the other fully commands the stage—that considering them as equals flattens the excitement of their encounter.
Additionally, the choice to use a woman to portray Sade detracts from the overall production. The acting is not wanting—Jampol is excellent as the libertine—but the fact that she is not the same gender as her character forces one more idea into the play, and it doesn’t quite fit.
“Marat/Sade” is a play that desperately wants its viewers to question their surroundings. If the current production gets tangled at times, it is because it doesn’t always know when to stop asking for more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week President Barack Obama signed into law a bill that expands federal hate-crime protection to include violent crimes committed on the basis of a victim’s sexual orientation. The definition of hate crime under existing legislation had only included crimes perpetrated because of a victim’s race, color, religion, or national origin. The passage of the hate-crimes law, named in honor of Matthew Shepard, a gay college student from Wyoming who was brutally murdered 11 years ago, was a long-overdue addition to a valuable set of protective laws.
By expanding its scope, Obama affirmed the continued need for hate-crime legislation. A hate crime should be treated distinctly from other offenses because of the particularly heinous nature of the act and because of its far-reaching implications. Perpetrators of hate crimes do not merely harm their victims—they inflict tremendous pain on the victim’s entire community. Hate crime generates feelings of fear and dismay that impact the lives of many more people than are directly affected by the crime itself. Unlike other crimes, a violent act committed against someone because of his race or religion carries the implicit threat of violence against others who share that characteristic.
Hate-crime legislation grew out of a long history of racial violence in America, during which violence was used as a way to intimidate and oppress African-Americans. Vicious crimes such as lynchings and beatings were intended to make the members of an entire racial group feel unwelcome and unsafe. The development of hate-crime legislation, beginning with the 1969 Federal Hate Crimes Law, became an important way to both discourage such acts and diminish the culture of prejudice and discrimination that often implicitly condoned them. The new hate-crimes law is an admirable continuation of efforts to curb bias-driven attacks.
Moreover, the law does not only guide the behavior of citizens—it is also a reflection of societal values. Holding hate crimes to special standards makes an important statement against the gross intolerance that motivates these violent acts. It says that crimes driven by racism, religious bigotry, and now homophobia have no place in our society.
Given the importance of hate-crime legislation, the extension of hate-crime protection to include another vulnerable group is a positive step forward. Attacks on individuals explicitly based on their sexual orientation or gender identity have been well documented for some time now but were not legally recognized as a special class of crimes. It is only fair for the government to finally afford gays and lesbians the same legal protections that safeguard members of other frequently targeted groups.
Above all, the passage of the hate-crimes law is essential to ensuring that all citizens feel protected under the law and that none should fear for their safety due to the color of their skin, the nature of their beliefs, or the gender of the person they love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although I had heard reports about drug-violence problems in Mexico—mostly from friends who received travel warnings while planning spring-break trips to Cancun—a recent trip to Mexico proved that the drug problem producing this violence is unavoidable even in the “safest” parts of the country. After only a week, my family stumbled upon a murder scene and learned of the death of a close friend at the hands of La Familia. A recent law to legalize possession of small amounts of drugs in Mexico is a step in the right direction, but much more remains to be done.
I once considered myself strongly in support of the tough measures that President Felipe Calderón has been taking to fight the war on drugs in Mexico. Believing that sometimes things must get worse before they get better, I supported Calderon’s aggressive campaign against the drug cartels. However, this policy has not proven effective after more than two years.
Mexico has finally altered its approach to the drug problem, if only slightly. In August, Mexico legalized the possession of small amounts of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. While this may bring about slight improvements in the justice system in Mexico, the law is unlikely to halt the violence that stems in large part from Calderón’s policies and the consumption habits of the U.S. These two forces are undermining the stability of Mexico and will soon threaten the U.S as well.
The new law in Mexico allows a person to carry enough marijuana to roll four joints and enough cocaine to snort about four lines. The law will be a boon for drug addicts and American tourists, who will no longer fear sleepless nights in Mexican prison (As long as they forgo the fifth joint). But it is unlikely to have any other obvious effects. The law is a step in the right direction and will stop some of the corruption in police forces: It has been common practice for people found possessing drugs to face jail time, unless, of course, they pay off the police officers.
In reality, the new law may stop some corruption on a very small scale, but the pressing issue of increasing violence in Mexico will not be solved. Profits reaped by the drug cartels will remain high because of the strong demand from the U.S. and Europe and because of remaining prohibitive laws that drive up the price of the drugs. The drug cartels most responsible for the violence are still going to trade within a black market and operate outside the regulatory strictures of government because the sale of drugs is still illegal. Weapons will remain easily accessible to drug cartels because of lax laws in the United States, allowing the cartels to act as de facto militias. Meanwhile, Calderón’s policy of military action will continue to force cartels to uproot, move into the territory of rivals, and perpetuate a cycle of violence and bloodshed.
There is only one solution remaining: Further legalize drugs in Mexico while also taking steps to legalize marijuana in the U.S.
The Obama administration should be lauded for not pressuring Calderón to veto the recent law, like the Bush administration did in 2006 when a similar bill was being considered. The Obama administration seems to be moving toward a more liberal policy regarding marijuana, but it is moving at a much slower pace than Mexico. Attorney General Eric Holder recently directed federal prosecutors to shift their focus away from cases involving medical marijuana infractions and to focus on higher-level drug traffickers.
America’s role in solving the problem is crucial. Former President Vicente Fox recently gave a speech in which he stated that the export market of the United States might become even more valuable if the domestic market in Mexico were to collapse due to the increasing instability. As instability increases, the domestic drug trade will become less profitable, creating even more incentives to trade within the United States.
Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has been one of the most outspoken proponents of the legalization of drugs in the U.S. as a solution to the problems in Mexico. He cites the historical analogy of the failed policy of Prohibition during the Great Depression, which was ended partly because of increasing violence in the U.S. Yet lawmakers in Congress seem reluctant to even broach the subject of drug legalization. Representative Barney Frank ’62 (D-Mass) has been one of the few to attempt to change the law with his Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008, which he sponsored to end federal penalties for marijuana possession. Besides Frank, however, few congressmen have touched this taboo issue. As violence in Mexico increases, with inevitable spillover into the U.S., America will have to end the “War on Drugs,” which President Barack Obama has already admitted was an utter failure.
There are signs that a shift may be on the way: In January, the city council of El Paso, which borders Mexico’s Ciudad Juarez—arguably the most dangerous city in Mexico—passed a resolution to open up dialogue on an end to drug prohibition in the United States. The resolution was vetoed by the mayor, partly because he was afraid of losing federal funds for the city, but nevertheless achieved the intended effect of raising awareness of the issue.
Over the weekend, gunmen murdered a peasant union leader and 14 others in the latest high-profile drug killings. With violence and bloodshed at the doorstep of our border with Mexico, America can no longer ignore the deteriorating circumstances of our neighbor to the south. Now that force has failed, an end to drug prohibition is the obvious next step.

The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, signed into law by President Obama on Oct. 28, represents both the best and the worst of the modern-day civil rights movement. Given the current legal framework, it was outrageous that crimes committed against individuals due to their sexual orientation were excluded from the roster of hate crimes. By correcting this injustice, the Shepard Act accomplished something important. However, the act also upholds and perpetuates the noxious notion that crimes ought to be weighted by the nebulous standard of “hate”—a concept that should not have a place in our legal system. Without hatecrime legislation, all individuals would be treated equally under the law; the current system unfairly privileges certain groups with special protection.
Dark was the day that it ceased to be true that all crimes of equal magnitude were equally tragic, no matter the gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation of the victim, for that day also marked the transition from the tradition that crimes are an offense against society to the view that crimes are only an offense against the groups with whom the victim is associated. Ironically, this treatment of crime widens the chasms between groups rather than narrows them, for it actually perpetuates and legitimizes the belief that society is composed of compartmentalized groups instead of fundamentally similar individuals.
And why should this compartmentalization extend only to gender, race, religion, and sexual orientation? Religion, which is covered under existing hate-crime legislation, is as much a choice as ideology, so why not protect the latter? Should political leanings be placed under the umbrella of hate-crimes protections? Should this aegis be extended to include Neo-Nazis and Klansmen? Why not include hatred based upon weight, height, hair color, state of origin, sports-team affliation, or any other demographic characteristic under hate-crimes protections?
This inexorable ambiguity permeates all facets of what constitutes a hate crime, including the highly questionable notion that the repugnance of a crime escalates due to the intangible, unquantifiable impact that it has upon those to whom the perpetrator did nothing. Proponents of hate-crimes legislation posit that crimes committed against individuals due to their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation are particularly heinous due to the fact that they intimidate and offend all members of those groups. But all crimes, by their very nature, intimidate and offend more than just the victims, for crimes are affronts to society as a whole. Does a burglar not intimidate and offend all residents of the neighborhood in which his victims dwell?
The most pernicious implications of hate-crimes laws, however, are those tied to freedom of thought. America is a country in which everyone is entitled to his opinion, no matter how odious that opinion may be. People have the right to be offensive, so long as their views do not lead to actions that extend beyond speech or thought. But this premise complicates the legitimacy of hate-crimes laws. If racism is permitted legally but murder is not, then how can it be justified for murder borne out of racism to be treated more severely than any other kind of murder?
It is truly a paradox that those who clamor most ardently for the erasure of divisions between races also advocate most passionately for institutionalizing these divides by granting different groups different treatment under the law. They forget that law is supposed to be what unites a society, not cleaves it.

This has been quite a year for Republican governors. First there was Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who spent five days crying in Argentina and came back to tell us that he just met a girl named Maria. Then there was Sarah Palin of Alaska, who resigned her post because she’s a point guard, gosh darn it, and she knows when to pass the ball of freedom so that America can dunk it into the basket of small government. And now there’s Rick Perry, governor of Texas, whose story is less scintillating but more jaw-droppingly, head-shakingly unethical.
The sad tale goes like this. In 2004, under Perry’s watch, Texas executed Cameron Todd Willingham for setting the 1991 fire that killed his three daughters. A few days before the execution, Perry and the Board of Pardons and Paroles received a report from independent fire expert Gerald Hurst, which said that there was not “a single item of physical evidence” to suggest arson. The governor and the board could have delayed the execution to find out more, but they didn’t.
In the last few years, Hurst’s findings have been confirmed by three other independent examinations of the forensic evidence, including one by Craig Beyler, a fire scientist hired by the Texas Forensic Science Commission. Beyler’s scathing report, released in August, concludes that the original investigation of the Willingham fire “did not comport with the scientific method” and was “more characteristic of mystics or psychics.” Days before Beyler was to present his findings before the commission, Perry fired three commissioners, including the chairman of the nine-member panel, and a fourth got the axe shortly thereafter. Perry’s replacement chairman, a conservative prosecutor, promptly canceled the hearings. Samuel Bassett, the former chairman, said that the governor and his lawyers repeatedly expressed their disapproval of the commission’s investigation and implied that its funding could be cut.
In short, Perry is fighting an audacious and losing battle to prevent a full, public recognition of the fact that Willingham was, in all likelihood, innocent. But talk of probabilities and likelihoods do death-penalty opponents little good. The legal reality is that Willingham should not have been executed; the doctrine of reasonable doubt establishes that much. But the moral reality is that we may never have, as Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick put it, a “sufficiently innocent criminal.” The biggest fans of the death penalty will always assume away the exonerating evidence and focus on the little things that help them sleep at night.
That doesn’t mean that abolitionists shouldn’t continue to point out the flaws and frailties of the criminal-justice system. It just means that “He was innocent!” can never be their rallying cry. They will have to continue outlining the bugs in the system (incompetent lawyers, hole-ridden testimony, jailhouse snitches, flawed confessions, and the like) in hopes that the public will see that they inevitably add up to wrongful convictions—and sometimes executions.
Perhaps the most disturbing thing about Perry’s behavior is how little he seems to care for evidence. He insulted the skeptical fire scientists as “latter-day supposed experts” and called Willingham a “monster”—as if that settles the matter. Perry could have let the commission hold its hearings, and it would have been an embarrassment to him; he would have had to admit a mistake. Instead, he has bumblingly tried to cover his hide, demonstrating in the process that truth and evidence, guilt and innocence, just don’t matter to him.
Which is kind of refreshing, in its way. Because, let’s face it, individual guilt and innocence really don’t matter to the most ardent death-penalty supporters. A third of Americans support capital punishment despite believing that an innocent person has been executed in the last five years, according to a recent Gallup poll. It’s about getting revenge, not doing justice. Groups like the Innocence Project assume that if they could find a demonstrably guiltless victim of the death penalty, they would sway the public to their side. But they’d never sway Perry and his ilk. For them, the death penalty possesses such magical powers, deterring future criminals and healing grieving communities, that surely one misfire shouldn’t sink the whole enterprise.
But at least Perry has good company in his disregard for actual guilt and innocence. In June, the five conservatives on the Supreme Court ruled that a convicted rapist could not demand DNA testing of the evidence against him, even though it had been unavailable during his trial and he offered to foot the bill. Two months later, in another case, Justice Scalia wrote that the Constitution does not forbid the execution of a prisoner who had his trial but later proves that he is “‘actually’ innocent.” Seriously, he put scare quotes around “actually.” We shouldn’t let Rick Perry get away with doing the same.

In the end, J-term housing wasn’t so difficult to obtain after all.
This past Monday, a mere 11 days after the application deadline, the College officially granted J-term housing to 1,316 out of the 1,404 undergraduates who applied—yielding a surprisingly high acceptance rate of 93 percent. Given the College’s ambiguous pre-deadline statements as to how many applicants it would allow to stay on campus and which student needs would actually translate into dormitory swipe access, the decision to permit almost all J-term applicants to stay at Harvard in January is both encouraging and commendable.
Originally, the administration had set a 1,000-person cap on the number of students who would be allowed to spend January in Harvard housing. We appreciate the flexibility of the College’s ultimate decision to admit more students who demonstrated legitimate needs (though the actual number on campus will never dramatically exceed 1,000 due to students’ different schedules). And, by any standard, the 93 percent of applicants accepted—which included students ranging from thesis writers to athletes to members of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals—is an impressive number to accommodate.
It is worth noting, however, that this high acceptance rate could have been even higher if the College allowed other students to stay on campus provided that they were willing to forgo a meal plan during their stay. These students would live in their houses and do their work like other J-term residents, but would eat elsewhere. Given the low cost of maintaining such meal-free roomers, we see no reason why these students could not also be allowed to spend at least a portion of January at Harvard.
But, overall, Monday’s results are excellent news, and we are pleased that the College, for the most part, recognized the wide array of reasons students have for remaining on campus during what would otherwise be an additional 20 days of vacation. But as this is the inaugural J-term—and these 1,316 students the first to be granted the privilege to remain on campus during that time—those in residence should behave responsibly so as not to ruin the chances of future applicants to receive housing during what, for many, is bound to be a crucial period for training, research, and intellectual activity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you gotten your absentee ballot for the ’09 elections yet? Or, to take a step back—have you even heard of the ’09 elections? On Tuesday, Virginia and New Jersey residents will elect a governor, and residents of New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, Boston, and 70 other major cities will elect a mayor. Maine residents will vote on whether to preserve gay marriage, and Ohioans will vote on whether to allow casinos in its major cities and whether to establish a board to set livestock care standards. And Texans will vote on a whole 11 issues, including whether to allow state militia to hold other civil offices.
Local elections like these often get overlooked because they occur during election years that don’t feature marquee presidential or Senate races, but this is a mistake. Local government officials, like a mayor or governor, often have a more direct, immediate impact on everyday life in an area than national officials, and selecting them carefully is therefore of great importance. I, for example, am registered to vote in my hometown of West Windsor, N.J. Unless President Obama reinstates the draft tomorrow, my family’s day-to-day existence won’t change because of his relatively remote decisions. However, West Windsor Mayor Shing-Fu Hsueh’s decision about the creation of a retail area around our town train station will directly influence day-to-day life in the place I go back to every Thanksgiving, Christmas, and summer.
These issues deserve consideration, for many times we don’t realize the influence these local elections have until it’s too late. In 2007, Utah residents used their regional power to veto the Parent Choice in Education Act that had been passed by the Utah legislature and signed by the governor, which if passed into law would have offered private-school scholarships to nearly all public-school students. Similarly, experts thought last year’s proposition to decriminalize marijuana in Massachusetts had no chance of passing, but it was successful, putting the state into Canada-like territory for acceptable drug use. And, most infamously, opposition to Proposition 8 became a cause célèbre only after it was voted through by California residents.
Ultimately, we should vote in local elections not only because they affect us tremendously, but also because it’s our responsibility as citizens of a democracy. Voting isn’t a once-every-four-years affair; it’s the culmination of a democratic way of life that prioritizes involvement in our government. Only voting in well-publicized elections that generate table chatter indicates that we only vote when it is popular to do so. But elections aren’t like the Olympics or the World Cup, and it’s demeaning to our system of government to treat them on the same level as these events.
We all were given the choice between registering in our hometowns and Cambridge, so supposedly we have some connection to the place where we vote. If you root for the Yankees or Mets, get angry when someone says Boston is the cleaner city and can’t go to ‘Nochs without saying, “You know the best place for pizza is really New York,” then you should probably be voting in the mayoral election this fall. Along the same lines, anyone who cares about their hometown can best demonstrate this by helping to decide its future. It’s a right that’s valuable, and one we give up too easily.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Hillel invited guest speaker Dr. Deborah E. Lipstadt, a prominent opponent of Holocaust deniers, to join a discussion about the realities of Holocaust denial last Friday.
The conversation was spurred by The Harvard Crimson’s publication of a controversial advertisement in early September that suggested the Holocaust did not occur. The Crimson issued a statement the following day, explaining that the publication of the advertisement had been a result of miscommunication and failed oversight.
Hillel undergraduate president Rebecca D. Gillette ’10 told the audience that the advertisement “served as a reminder of the persisting and troubling reality of Holocaust denial.” She added that she hoped the conversation would increase awareness of the existence of Holocaust denial.
The discussion was led by Lipstadt, a Jewish studies scholar who successfully fought libel charges from a Holocaust denier in England. Speaking candidly to a diverse audience—which included Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson, as well as student leaders from political, religious, and cultural groups on campus—Lipstadt argued that there should be no debate about whether the Holocaust happened or not.
“Deniers are not a point of view,” she said. “They are liars and falsifiers of history. Deniers take the data and twist it and turn and distort it.”
Lipstadt also discussed what she called “soft-core Holocaust denial,” a new form of denial in which the Holocaust “gets mixed up with other things” and is “used as a misrepresentation.” As an example, she cited the comparison of George W. Bush to Hitler, which she said suggested an implicit denial of the Holocaust.
“To compare [Bush] to Hitler is to turn history on its head,” said Lipstadt.
After Lipstadt’s presentation, members of the audience took part in an intimate discussion about the Holocaust, often sharing stories from their personal experiences.
“I didn’t know what to expect,” said Jason Y. Shah ’11, chair of South Asian Men’s Collective. “I was impressed by the level of candidness [with which] everybody spoke, given our different ethnic backgrounds. It was uniquely productive and very anecdotal.”
Gillette said that the diversity of the group was “remarkable,” adding that these individuals are not often brought together to have meaningful discussions.
“This event should be a motivator and model for similar kinds of conversations about other things,” she said. “This is a good way to start relationship between groups.”
As a direct result of this discussion, the South Asian Men’s Collective is currently planning a dinner with Hillel.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
Cambridge voters will elect nine City Councillors tomorrow from a field of 21 hopefuls who put forth their visions for a more efficient and responsive city government in interviews with The Crimson last week.
As the nine-member legislative body of Cambridge, the Council votes on city ordinances and also hires the City Manager, the city’s chief executive. In January, the councillors will choose one of their number to serve as mayor.
In the two years that have elapsed since the last election for City Council members, Cambridge has worked to confront an ongoing achievement gap in its public schools and a continuing discrimination lawsuit involving the city manager, as well as the local fallout of the national economic crisis.
In light of these issues, the candidates for the city councillor posts—including several first-time candidates and all current incumbents—have been proposing suggestions to improve Cambridge schools, energy use, city finances, and city administration.
CHALLENGING THE MANAGER
Many of the challengers for the councillor positions said they felt compelled to enter the campaign after feeling dissatisfied with the responsiveness of the Council and the amount of power exercised by City Manager Robert W. Healy.
Controversy has swirled around Healy since a May 2008 ruling ordered the city to pay Malvina Monteiro, a former city employee, $4.5 million. Monteiro, who had filed an earlier discrimination complaint against Healy, claimed that he had her fired in 2003 in retaliation. Healy has continued to fight the decision despite an unsuccessful appeal in April.
Challenger Sylvia P. Glick said she perceived a lack of attention from councillors and city residents to the amount that the legal battle is costing the city.
“Why is it that most of the people in Cambridge do not know that the city is controlled by an un-elected city manager who has a $4.5 million jury verdict against him?” Glick said.
In May, the Council considered but did not pass an effort to prevent Healy’s use of city funds to further appeal the 2008 ruling.
Healy, who has been in office for 28 years, has garnered the support of most councillors and has presided over the maintenance of the city’s AAA bond rating. In January, his contract was renewed for another three years by a nearly unanimous vote, in which Councillor Craig A. Kelley was the only one to dissent.
“Too often, almost all of the current City Council [members] do not pay attention to the issues,” said James Williamson, a second-time challenger who expressed pessimism about his election chances but said he hopes to draw attention to the Council’s ineffectiveness.
CONTINUING CONCERNS
Candidates for Council expressed concern regarding not only the lawsuit, but also enduring issues such as school performance, energy efficiency, and economic stability of the city.
Vice Mayor Sam Seidel, who was first elected in 2007, named the improvement of the Cambridge Public School system the “number one issue” of his campaign. He said he is especially concerned with the availability of after-school programs for Cambridge students.
Education also figures largely in the campaign of challenger Neal W. Leavitt ’96, who emphasized the importance of narrowing the achievement gap beginning at a young age.
In regards to the issue of energy efficiency, Councillor Henrietta J. Davis—who was first elected to the Council in 1995—said the Council should continue to push forward initiatives like ensuring the conformity of the city’s new library and its other construction projects to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards developed by the U.S. Green Building Council.
Other candidates also have suggestions for energy efficiency, such as Leavitt’s idea of building an off-shore wind farm in the outer reaches of Boston Harbor.
The city’s fiscal responsibility is another issue of concern to candidates. Cambridge’s city budget grew by 2 percent this fiscal year from the year before—a growth, according to City Manager Healy, that in part alleviates the $9.7 million reduction in state aid to the city.
Challenger Edward J. Sullivan said that the councillors’ pay is too high and ought to be cut before funding is taken from city projects. Sullivan speciftically mentioned a youth summer program in the Area IV neighborhood that had seen reduction in its hours.
GETTING OUT THE VOTE
Despite lively debate among candidates, trends in voter turnout indicate that there may not be a comparable level of enthusiasm from city residents. In the 2007 municipal election, only 13,721 voters cast ballots, although the city boasted nearly 57,000 registered voters at the time.
Figures detailing the number of Harvard students registered to vote in Cambridge are not available, but several candidates said they hoped that university students would turn out at the polls tomorrow.
In fact, first-time challenger Leland Cheung—a student at both Harvard Kennedy School and the MIT Sloan School of Management—said that his campaign focuses on issues highly relevant to students, such as improving public safety and enhancing dialogue between the city and universities.
Five-time incumbent Marjorie C. Decker said last month that she is concerned about voter turnout, especially since she is conducting a write-in campaign. Though Decker failed to file the paperwork necessary to declare official candidacy, she is distributing stickers bearing her name to allow voters to include her in their rankings of candidates.
Harvard students registered to vote in Cambridge can do so at one of several polling locations tomorrow, depending on their residence.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students in the Quad opened their doors Friday evening, they found themselves facing a three-foot tall Michael Jackson, a dead bride, and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz.
The dead bride, also known as Margaret Pena, is 13 years old and one of the students involved in Mission Hill After School—a tutoring and mentoring program that serves students in two housing projects in Mission Hill.
“I got divorced, so now I’m getting revenge,” Pena said, with her face covered in white and black paint.
Another girl, who wished to be identified only as Michael Jackson, claimed to have trick-or-treated at Harvard for the last 40 years. How old is she? “50, of course.” Her favorite song? “I like all of them. But especially ‘The Way You Make Me Feel.’”
The trick-or-treaters—50 Mission Hill After School students ranging in age from 5 to 14—knocked on the doors of Harvard’s dorms in the program’s annual Halloween sleepover night.
“The holiday really lends itself to having fun with kids,” said Amanda F. Guardado ’10, one of the heads of the Mission Hill After School program. “It would be a crime not to do anything.”
Through Mission Hill After School, Chinatown After School, and Boston Refugee Youth Enrichment (BRYE), the Phillips Brooks House Association brings more than 150 young students to trick-or-treat at the end of October.
The children’s annual presence on campus is one of the few lasting Halloween traditions at Harvard, and brings the students’ youthful spirit door-to-door every year.
A NIGHT IN DISGUISE
PBHA-sponsored trick-or-treating events allow undergraduate mentors to relive childhood Halloween memories, and to provide their students with an opportunity to celebrate the holiday in a welcoming environment.
Chinatown After School hosted 47 kids last Saturday to trick-or-treat in first-year dorms in the yard.
Chinatown After School set up a carnival in Currier House, complete with games, face-painting, and pumpkin carving.
BRYE also had a trick-or-treating event during the day on Halloween for the students in the program.
At the first stop on Mission Hill’s trick-or-treating tour, kids scrambled up the stairs, racing to be the first at the door.
But as soon as they knocked and the doors opened, they fell silent, suddenly nervous to be face-to-face with a college student. “Trick-or-treat?” they offered quietly, with wide eyes.
The volunteers stood at their sides, like proud parents. “Remember to say thank you!” they instructed.
“Sometimes I say I haven’t gotten any candy so that I get more,” confided Michael Jackson to one of her leaders.
The students in the Quad who volunteered to have candy on hand were eager to welcome the little guests. “We miss doing this at home,” Cabot resident Nan R. Du ’12 said.
“I would absolutely do it again. It makes me feel like I’m living at home,” Cabot resident tutor Richard Johnston said.
Program directors said bringing their students to Harvard’s campus allows them to celebrate Halloween safely—an opportunity they may otherwise not have.
“Most of these kids won’t go trick-or-treating on Halloween. Many of them live in apartment buildings in Chinatown, which is not conducive to trick-or-treating,” said Lydia Krooss, a sophomore at Wellesley and one of the heads of Chinatown After School. “A lot of the kids are from immigrant families—the idea of trick-or-treating seems kind of strange.”
“Chinatown is very crowded and safety is a big issue for the younger ones,” said John Z. Zhao ’12, another head of Chinatown After School.
On Friday, Mission Hill volunteers gathered in the Quad to shepherd their students from dorm to dorm as they wildly shouted trick-or-treat songs.
“Maybe this will tire them out before the sleepover,” one volunteer suggested with a shrug.
A LASTING TRADITION
Though PBHA’s trick-or-treating events are one of the few ongoing Halloween traditions at Harvard, there is virtually no institutional record of their inception.
None of the heads of the programs interviewed knew which of the groups had started the trick-or-treating tradition.
PBHA Director of Programs Robert J. Bridgeman said the trick-or-treating traditions began before he arrived at PBHA 15 years ago.
While the origins of this tradition remain unclear, it is one of the few annual Halloween activities that still continues today.
For example, Harvard Crimson editors used to trick-or-treat at the homes of deans and administrators each Halloween and compare their candy offerings, according to Professor of Folklore and Mythology Stephen A. Mitchell and The Crimson’s archives. But the last record of Crimson trick-or-treating was in 1993.
Mitchell said he recalled Halloween events taking place in the upperclassmen Houses, but didn’t remember any annual traditions.
Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said institutionally-sponsored events for students, and occasionally, department-sponsored events for faculty families, are held from year to year.
Until a new tradition takes hold, it looks like the kids will be here to stay. “Everyone just likes it so much and it works so well, that I can’t imagine wanting to end it,” Krooss said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ralph Nader, the left-wing activist and frequent presidential contender, promoted his new book—“‘Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!’”—to an audience of mostly Harvard Law School students last Friday at HLS, his alma mater.
A prolific author of non-fiction works such as “Unsafe at Any Speed,” Nader attempts the genre of fiction for the first time in “‘Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!’” which was released in September.
The aim of the book—which Nader describes as being “practical utopian fiction” rather than a novel—is to describe a future that he sees as both bright and possible.
“I decided to write fiction because if I wrote it as non-fiction no one would believe me,” he said.
Nader’s protagonist is famed investor Warren E. Buffet. The plot describes the imaginary efforts of Buffet and a small coterie of other real-life elites to “take on the corporate goliaths” and “redirect the country toward long overdue changes,” Nader wrote in a recent piece on OpEdNews.com.
But Nader’s speech was not only a promotion for his new book. He used “‘Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!’” as both a call to today’s law students and as a means of discussing some of the larger leftist ideas with which he has long been associated.
While reminiscing about his own experience at the Law School—from which he graduated in 1958—Nader rejected what he called a commercial bias in the curriculum, which he connected with the recent bailouts on Wall Street.
“The law is being evaded, circumvented, destroyed, and mocked,” he said. “What’s your indignation level? We’re not dealing with trivia here—we’re dealing with our country.”
Nader’s remarks also criticized the “high-risk” investment policies pursued by former University President Lawrence H. Summers and what he described as the silence from law schools nationwide during the Bush Administration’s military actions.
“Where were the law schools? Where were the deans?” Nader asked. “We’re seeing a very serious decay of our legal system.”
Many of the attendees nodded in response to Nader’s remarks throughout the event.
“I think Ralph Nader is an American hero, and I think it was really powerful for him to put in perspective how the status quo when he was here was taken as the way things should be,” said Craig S. Altemose, a third-year law student at HLS and a joint degree candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School.
Asked whether he will read Nader’s new book, Altemose was unsure.
“Eventually, perhaps,” he said. “I don’t get to read too often these days.”

Despite a recent study’s findings that college enrollment hit an all-time high in October 2008, the College has not seen dramatic fluctuations in its enrollment number in the past years.
According to a Pew Research Center study released last week, 39.6 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds—or 11.5 million students—were enrolled in a two- or four-year college last October. The increase derives primarily from dramatic growth in community college enrollment, according to the study.
Other factors contributing to the increase in enrollment include the “great recession” and an all-time high in the number of high school graduates—not to mention that the upswing continues a long-term trend, according to Richard A. Fry, a senior researcher at the center and the author of the study, which evaluated data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Fry said that the study is of “limited particular relevance to Harvard,” given that the College has typically seen an excess demand for a limited number of seats—whereas community colleges are able to adjust enrollment figures in accordance with applicant numbers—and that the primary surge impelling the surge in enrollment occurred in the context of community colleges.
Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, director of admissions at the College, said that the population that contributes to the surge in community college enrollment does not typically correspond to Harvard’s applicant pool.
Though enrollment numbers will not see any drastic changes, the admissions office is running ahead of the number of applications that it had received at this point last year, according to McGrath. She said that the overall increase in applications to the College over the past few years can be attributed in part to a greater value placed on a college education.
“I would not be surprised if we had something of an increase,” McGrath said about application numbers, noting that a definitive figure is premature.
Linda A. Cross, director of media relations at the Extension School, said that the School has seen a steady increase in course enrollments, particularly for online classes.
This increase is likely independent of the results of the Pew study—which surveys 18- to 24-year-olds attending college—as 75 percent of Extension School students already have college degrees, and the average student is 32-years-old.
Fry said that the study’s importance lies in its recognition of a nationwide phenomenon.
“I don’t think this is earth-shattering,” Fry said. “[It] confirms what, anecdotally, people have noted at the local level.”

Anthony A. Braga, a Sociology lecturer, was one of 12 individuals honored last month by the U.S. Attorney General for his work to combat Boston gang crime.
The award, which recognizes individuals who contribute to community partnerships for public safety, was part of the 57th Annual Attorney General’s Awards, a slate of national public service awards presented in Washington, D.C each year.
Braga, along with the award’s other recipients, was nominated by U.S. Attorney Michael J. Sullivan and personally approved by U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. The other awardees included members of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Boston, the U.S. Department of Justice, local law enforcement, and anti-violence advocacy groups.
Braga, who specializes in criminal justice and policy, was recognized primarily for his work with two specific public safety projects: Operation Ceasefire, a program that seeks to reduce gun violence among gangs and youth, and the Boston Re-entry Initiative, which helps former prisoners transition to law-abiding lives in the community.
For each program, Braga used his knowledge of statistical analysis to help the organizations achieve their goals. Working with Operation Ceasefire, Braga studied quantitative data to identify Boston’s most dangerous gangs, allowing law enforcers to focus on those areas with the highest levels of violence. He also used his statistical expertise to evaluate the Boston Re-entry Initiative and determine its effectiveness in preventing repeat offenses.
True-See Allah, director of the Boston Re-entry Initiative and one of the award’s other recipients, said that Braga’s findings have been a crucial component of the organization’s work.
“I’m not a data person but the stats do tell a story,” he said.
Braga wrote in an e-mailed statement that his motivation to study violent crime stemmed from past personal experience.
“I have been the victim of violent crime and understand what it is like to be afraid to walk around public spaces,” he wrote. “Over the years, I have also known many young men and women who have been lost to gun violence in Boston’s neighborhoods.”
Braga credited his success to the supportive academic environment at Harvard, which has allowed him to engage in service outside of the “Ivory Tower” and bring “real-life lessons and insights to the classroom.”

The Undergraduate Council hosted the first of what members hope will be many town hall meetings last night, focusing on prospects for student group-led programming over the three-week January Term in future years.
Titled “J-Term: 2010, 2011, and Beyond,” the event featured a panel of student leaders, comprised of Mary K. B. Cox ’10, student president of the Institute of Politics and Richard S. Kelley ’10, student president of the Phillips Brooks House Association.
In addition, UC President Andrea R. Flores replaced Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua McIntosh on the panel. According to Flores, McIntosh felt the town hall’s discussion was better focused on future J-terms, for which the administration has yet to make firm plans.
Flores said that although financial constraints prevent the administration from offering its own programming for this year’s J-term, student groups are another source of potential programming during the break.
“While the budget cuts are happening, the UC is being conscious of what other things we can be doing so that students who want that enrichment [during J-term] can have the opportunity,” she said.
According to Kelley, PBHA is offering two Habitat for Humanity trips this J-term. PBHA plans to increase J-term programming in the future, which may include moving many of its alternative spring break trips to the winter break.
“More people will have the opportunity to travel, to explore and to expand, while doing service,” he said.
Cox suggested that student groups interested in having programming during future J-terms submit proposals to the administration outlining their day-to-day activities.
“We need to convey to the administration that they can trust us,” Cox said, referring to perceived concerns on the part of the administration that idle students on campus during J-term would be disruptive. “Just as student groups during the semester really do amazing stuff on their own, there is really creative stuff that comes from the student body that we can be doing during J-term,” Cox said.
The UC plans to gather a coalition of student group leaders to present proposals for pilot J-term programs in 2011, according to UC Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12.
Joshua M. Zagorsky ’11, who was granted housing to do research for this year’s J-Term, said he came to last night’s town hall because he was curious about winter break programming options.
“I like that [the UC] has town halls,” Zagorsky said. “It presents the opportunity for people who don’t have the time or ability to be seriously involved in student government to hear information and to give our opinions.
The town hall is one of the UC’s efforts to become more connected with the student body this year, said UC Student Relations Commitee Chair Daniel V. Kroop ’10.
The UC held a launch party last Friday to celebrate another component of this effort, the release of the UC’s official blog “UC Juicy”, as well as official Twitter and Facebook accounts.
Kroop said that non-UC students came to both the town hall and the launch party, which was a good sign.
“It’s a slow and building process that we’re starting,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Saturday’s 42-21 drubbing of Dartmouth, Harvard football was bolstered by its ground attack, as two players rushed for 100-plus yards—the first time two Crimson players have accomplished such a feat since 1999.
“They didn’t throw the ball a lot, by design apparently, and they just felt that they could run the football,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “We stacked the front—there were more numbers there than they could block. They ran over a couple of our guys, they put a couple of guys on the sideline—just very, very physical play with a couple of different backs.”
Those couple of different backs—junior Gino Gordon and freshman Treavor Scales—combined for 233 yards on the ground, while Gordon tacked on an additional 103 receiving yards. Scales rushed for 120 yards on 20 carries, while Gordon notched eight carries for 113 net yards.
But Gordon was quick to share the credit for his outstanding day.
“My success goes completely to the line,” Gordon said. “The wide receivers don’t get enough credit blocking downfield. They did a tremendous job going downfield and making sure I had a nice area to run to.”
Gordon punctuated his performance in the third quarter with a 48-yard touchdown run, in which he broke through the line almost untouched.
“I was nicked,” Gordon said. “It was overall a good execution by the whole offense.”
“We take it upon ourselves to make sure that Gino gets 100-plus yards rushing, Treavor gets 100 yards rushing, Collier [Winters] has all the time in the world,” senior center Alex Spisak added on behalf of the offensive line. “We play like we are the best because we are the best.”
DOWN AND OUT
The overarching through-line of Harvard football’s season narrative has been its resiliency in light of injuries.
In Saturday’s game, an already-beleaguered Crimson defense was playing without the help of sophomore linebacker Alex Gedeon—who is out for the rest of the season with an elbow injury requiring surgery—or senior linebacker Conor Murphy, who sat out Saturday’s game with a sprained ankle.
“When guys go down, we know have a good core group,” senior linebacker Sean Hayes said.
Despite those losses—in addition to season-ending injuries to senior defensive end Ryan Burkhead and junior defensive end Ben Graeff—Harvard still ranks third in the league in total defense.
But the injuries aren’t just confined to the defense. Last week, senior running back Cheng Ho suffered a career-ending lisfranc fracture to his midfoot. Though relegated to the Crimson’s third-string running-back spot, Ho consistently bolstered the Harvard offense when he was called upon, like in Week 3’s contest against Lehigh, when he rushed for 132 yards on 21 carries with one rushing touchdown and one receiving.
“There’s a kid we could not have won back-to-back championships in 2007, 2008 without,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s a kid that always wore his heart on his sleeve and gave us incredible effort, production, emotion.”
PUT ME IN, COACH
The past two weeks, Harvard has taken the opportunity—late in the game with a comfortable lead—to work in some of its third- and fourth-string players.
“It’s hard to do with the schedule to get the young guys in,” Murphy said. “It’s great because the JV played [Friday]. Any time you can get guys in, it’s great. It’s great...to get some guys you don’t want to get dinged up out of the game, but it’s even better to get some young guys out there playing a varsity game in Harvard Stadium.”
Quarterbacks junior Matt Simpson and freshman Colton Chapple both took snaps on Saturday, while running backs junior Demetrius Gadson and freshman Rich Zajeski each logged three carries.
“To be perfectly honest with you, it wasn’t pretty offensively with the second unit because to some extent Dartmouth still had its first unit it,” Murphy said. “They did a great job effort-wise.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a 42-21 blowout—a gap which could have been much bigger if Harvard head coach Tim Murphy hadn’t given his second team an entire quarter’s worth of playing time—it’s hard to find fault with the Crimson. But in Saturday’s matchup with Dartmouth, there was one area where the Big Green was clearly dominant—special teams.
A missed 27-yard field goal. A fumbled kickoff. A misread on a fake field goal play. A blocked punt. From start to finish, when the Crimson’s offensive and defensive units were on the sidelines, Dartmouth was in control.
“We did not do a great job in what I call situation awareness,” Murphy said. “I felt it was a fairly obvious fake field goal situation, onside kick situation, they block a punt, all of those things. We have to finish better.”
Though the majority of Harvard’s special teams struggles had a lot to do with the Big Green’s play, the first miscue was all on the Crimson.
On Harvard’s second drive, a long series of rushes brought the Crimson deep into Dartmouth territory. Facing fourth and six from the Big Green 11, Harvard went with the safe bet—a 28-yard field goal.
But senior Patrick Long’s kick went wide right, and the Crimson wasted its first red-zone opportunity of the game.
Long has struggled making field goals all season, with only a 50-percent success rate for the season. His longest kick of the season is just 30 yards, a disappointment coming off a year in which Long set the single-season Harvard record with 13 made field goals, hitting a long of 45 yards.
But Long’s error was the least glaring of the special teams mistakes on the afternoon.
Midway through the third quarter, and with fourth and four on the Crimson 15, Dartmouth came out in what looked to be a field-goal situation.
But the Big Green pulled a fast one, executing a trick play to perfection. Reilly got the ball and rushed for 10 yards, converting for a crucial first down. A pair of quick Dartmouth rushes put the ball in the endzone.
And special teams would generate the third Big Green touchdown as well.
Late in the game, senior Thomas Hull and his punt unit came out in a fourth-and-two situation on the Harvard 28. But Hull’s punt was blocked by Dartmouth senior safety Pete Pidermann, and the ball wound up in the hands of Big Green receiver Michael Reilly, who ran it back 16 yards for a score.
With the score 42-21 and just five minutes left on the clock, the Crimson lined up expecting an onsides kick.
But Dartmouth surprised Harvard again, dropping the kick behind the front line. After a bad bounce, the Big Green recovered the ball on the Crimson 23.
“We had a deep opportunity the way they dispersed,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “As you saw, it kicked towards the kicker and spun back. I’d like to say we teach the kicker to do that, but it happened, and the guys did a nice job. That’s a tough situation—you defend the onsides, you defend deep, you give up something one way or another, but it worked out for us.”
The Big Green dominated the kick return stats as well, totaling 136 yards to the Harvard’s 66.
“I think [special teams coach Tony] Reno has done a terrific job, but we definitely have made some errors out there,” Murphy said. “The judgment error on the kickoff that they recovered, the deep kickoff they recovered. We obviously didn’t block anybody on the punt block. It wasn’t a great day on special teams, but we were thankfully able to overcome it.”
With the Harvard run game and defense shutting Dartmouth down on both sides of the ball, the Crimson could afford to get its special teams miscues out of its system this week. But big games lie ahead for Harvard—mainly the Week 9 marquee matchup with Penn which will in all likelihood, decide the Ivy title—and the team can’t afford to make so many mistakes against a stronger, more experienced team.
The Big Green exposed a weakness for the Crimson, but now it’s one that can be fixed before the Quakers come to town. And if Harvard can finally put together the complete game it’s been waiting for all season, it could be enough to take Penn down.
“We tell our guys, [special teams] has to be an aspect of the game that we dominate,” Teevens said. “But we didn’t keep them off the board, and you can’t do that…We have a lot of respect for them—they’re a very, very physical football team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a tough mid-season loss to Lafayette two weeks ago, the Crimson crushed another Ivy League opponent on Saturday. Harvard football (5-2, 4-0 Ivy) justified its place at the top of the Ancient Eight with a 42-21 victory over Dartmouth (1-6, 1-3) just a week after trouncing Princeton, 37-3.
The overwhelming power of the Crimson’s offensive line and key performances from the team’s running backs allowed Harvard to double up on the Big Green at Harvard Stadium.
“We take a lot of pride in our abilities up front,” senior center Alex Spisak said of the offensive line. “We know that we will control the offense, [and] we will make the plays.”
Dartmouth struggled to put up a fight against the veteran lines of the home team, and the mismatch of size and age eventually became the Big Green’s downfall.
“A lot of it came down to physical strength,” Dartmouth coach Buddy Teevens said. “They’re a stronger football team than we were.”
The Crimson was able to make crucial blocks up front to allow junior running back Gino Gordon and freshman running back Treavor Scales to each record over 100 yards on the ground. Saturday’s game marked the first time in a decade that two Harvard players rushed for triple-digit yards in the same contest.
“My success goes completely to the line,” Gordon said. “They open up a whole lot of opportunities as far as running’s concerned.”
Gordon led the Crimson with an average of 14.1 yards per carry, 216 total yards, and three touchdowns.
“It’s a milestone for any back to accomplish that,” said Harvard head coach Tim Murphy. “He’s a real, real tough guy. You see the skills, you see him be very versatile, but at the heart, he’s just a tough guy.”
Scales contributed two more scores and a total of 120 rushing yards, and junior quarterback Collier Winters threw for one touchdown, 204 yards, and no interceptions against the Big Green’s struggling defense.
Harvard’s defense had a much stronger showing, holding Dartmouth to only 262 total yards, compared to the Crimson’s 521.
“Our kids are really, really committed,” Murphy said. “[They did] a good job block destructing, good job [with] gap control, good job tackling. We never let them get their run game off the ground.”
Unlike its opponent, the Crimson got its running game started early on Saturday. After some back-and-forth play and a missed Harvard field goal, Scales recorded the first touchdown on a 40-yard run 12 minutes into the game.
The Crimson’s successful defensive play started early as well. Harvard shut out the Big Green in the first frame, holding it to only two first downs before the end of the quarter.
“I thought our linebackers especially really did a great job of playing great gap control and attacking the line of scrimmage,” Murphy said of the defense. “That gave us an opportunity to gain some momentum in the game.”
After Dartmouth was forced to punt at the beginning of the second frame, Gordon received and ran for three consecutive first downs to get into Big Green territory.
The Crimson kept the drive going with key plays from Winters and Scales to make it to the red zone, where Gordon stepped up again.
The running back scored his second touchdown on a 15-yard run, thanks to a crucial block by junior fullback Anthony Rotio.
With the score 14-0 in the home team’s favor, Dartmouth finally put together a run to get into scoring position but failed to execute. Big Green quarterback Connor Kempe threw a pass that was intercepted by Harvard senior defensive back Ryan Barnes on the Crimson 18-yard line.
“Offensively we were inconsistent, made some foolish mistakes that cost us—turnovers,” Teevens said. “We didn’t put enough things together.”
Harvard capitalized on its opponent’s mistakes and took advantage of some timely penalties to convert the turnover. After a 62-yard drive, Scales ran in the ball from one yard out to make the score 21-0.
But Dartmouth put together a 63-yard drive of its own and scored its first touchdown on a 12-yard pass to Tanner Scott with 17 seconds left on the clock. This brought the Big Green within two scores of the Crimson before halftime.
Harvard came back from the break with a bang, racking up another touchdown within three minutes of the second half’s start. After Scales ran to get the ball past midfield, Gordon put together a spectacular 48-yard run to score.
The running back also pointed out the contributions made by his teammates.
Dartmouth responded to the Crimson’s big play with a 43-yard pass to Scott and a subsequent touchdown with about ten minutes left in the quarter.
But after a failed onsides kick, Harvard got a quick rebound of its own two minutes later, when Gordon recorded his third touchdown of the game.
With the score 35-14, the Crimson committed a string of penalties.
“We have not had a great time dealing with prosperity as a football team,” Murphy said. “We have to finish better. We have to play for 60 minutes.”
But the team recovered from its miscues and got back to scoring.
Before the end of the third quarter, Winters connected with freshman tight end Kyle Juszczyk for a 31-yard touchdown to bring the score to 42-14.
In the game’s final frame, the teams exchanged drives, but when a Crimson punt was blocked by the Big Green’s Pete Pidermann, receiver Michael Reilly returned the ball 16 yards for a touchdown with 5:06 left on the clock.
It looked like Dartmouth may have had a final push left, but Harvard held the score to 42-21 and secured the victory.
“We were a little bit better team, a little bit more seasoned than the Dartmouth team today,” Murphy said, “but they played with tremendous effort, obviously, right to the end and in a lot of ways gave us all we could handle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his return to the Crimson crease after a year-long leave of absence, junior Kyle Richter made 41 saves to anchor Harvard’s defensive efforts in the team’s season-opening 5-3 win over Dartmouth on Friday night at Thompson Arena.
“Obviously it was a very exciting to get back into the game,” Richter said. “I didn’t really play that much last year game-wise, so to get back into it, and Dartmouth has a great atmosphere, it was a good game, and the team played great winning on the road.”
The Crimson’s victory last night came after skating to a 3-3 tie with McGill in its exhibition game last weekend. The Big Green also played the Redmen in an exhibition last week and suffered a 7-4 loss.
“We know Dartmouth has a traditionally very fast and physical team,” co-captain Alex Biega said. “They definitely bring an up-tempo style of play to the game, and we just wanted to go out there and execute our game plan, which I think we did.”
On Friday, sophomore forward Alex Killorn led the Crimson in points with two goals and an assist in the second frame. Freshmen forwards Louis Leblanc and Marshall Everson along with sophomore forward Daniel Moriarty each contributed a goal and an assist as well.
After a dominant first period during which Harvard held a 13-5 shot advantage, Dartmouth rallied its offense to overwhelm the Crimson blue line by a margin of 24 shots through the second and third frames.
“Obviously, Kyle Richter had an unbelievable game,” Killorn said. “He kept us in the game, and he made some unbelievable saves. They had more shots on net, but I think we had about the same number of great scoring opportunities. We had a lot of great shots that missed the net.”
Despite Harvard’s offensive dominance during the first frame, the Crimson simply could not find the back of the net. Big Green goalie sophomore Jody O’Neill gloved senior forward Doug Rogers’ one-timer at net early in the first period to rid Harvard of its best scoring opportunity of the frame. Dartmouth then turned the tables on the Crimson after that, taking a 1-0 lead at 2:43 thanks to a tally from senior forward Rob Smith.
Harvard quickly turned things around during the second period. Skating down the right side towards the goal, Killorn received a pass from junior forward Mike Biega before shooting it over the goalie’s right shoulder to tie the game at a goal apiece just over a minute in.
Killorn scored his second of the night off a power play when the puck popped up between him and an open net to give the Crimson the lead at 12:40 in the second.
Less than three minutes later, Leblanc scored his first career goal off an exchange with Killorn that also came during a power play opportunity. The rookie blasted the puck over O’Neill’s shoulder and into the net.
“We knew coming into this year we would have a lot of freshman forwards and a lot of them were high profile players,” Killorn said. “[Leblanc’s] been playing really well and has been living up to all the hype.”
Harvard carried its scoring momentum into the third period, with Everson and Moriarty coming up with goals just two minutes apart about halfway through the frame.
But the Big Green wasn’t finished with the Crimson quite yet. Dartmouth put up a big offensive challenge late in the third, outshooting Harvard eight to one and scoring twice over the course of two minutes. The Big Green’s junior forward Adam Estoclet scored off a power play at 11:07, and senior forward Joe Gaudet made the score line 5-3 at 13:31 in the third.
But despite continued offensive pressure from Dartmouth through the rest of the period, Richter and the Crimson blue line came up with big saves to preserve the win.
“Dartmouth seemed to get some more energy behind them,” Richter said. “We got a few penalties, which allowed them to set up in our zone. They had a lot of shots, but our defense was good, making sure I could save all the shots.”
Harvard will be on the road again next weekend, taking on Colgate on Friday before a highly anticipated matchup with Cornell on Saturday night.
“It’s never an easy game against those guys,” Richter said. “Their fans are really into it so it gives them a boost for sure and they always give us a good game, so we’re looking forward to it. We want to build on Friday’s game and keep fine-tuning our team game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two come-from-behind rallies. Two different results.
“It could’ve gone either way,” was how senior goaltender Christina Kessler described the Harvard’s women’s ice hockey games against Colgate (1-6-1, 0-1-1 ECAC) and Cornell (2-2, 2-0 ECAC) this weekend. In fact, it went both ways, as the Crimson (1-1, 1-1 ECAC) lost to the Big Red, 4-3, on Saturday after defeating the Raiders, 2-1, on Friday.
Each contest was characterized by second-period Harvard rallies, but the Crimson was only able to seal the deal once, against Colgate.
“The playing field is so level,” co-captain Kathryn Farni added. “Every game is going to be a close battle.”
CORNELL 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard was able to rally after a slow start against Cornell, but it couldn’t close out the game as the Big Red’s Melanie Jue scored at 16:57 in the third period to give Cornell the win. The goal was the senior forward’s second of the day.
The final score overshadowed an impressive debut for the Crimson’s freshmen in their first weekend of college hockey.
“We’re asking a lot of them,” Farni said. “They’ve all done a great job. There’s a couple defensemen who are getting a lot of ice time and forwards being put in high pressure situations.”
One of those forwards is rookie Jillian Dempsey, who scored her first career goal Saturday.
“She’s tireless,” Stone said. “That goal came out of pure guts and tenaciousness. That’s what we were looking for when we recruited her, and that’s what we hope to get from her for the next four years.”
Dempsey’s goal came at 18:23 in the second period, giving Harvard a 2-1 lead. The Crimson had scored two goals in six minutes after being unable to find the back of the net for the first 32. Senior forward Anna McDonald had the first tally at 12:16 into the second.
“We’re growing,” co-captain Cori Bassett said. “It says a lot about the team that we were able to come back.”
The game sets Harvard back in the ECAC hunt, but the team is confident that it can overcome the early loss and right the ship against conference opponents.
“The way they celebrated after the game is something we don’t want to see again,” Kessler added. “When they come back, we’re going to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
HARVARD 2, COLGATE 1
Harvard emerged victorious from its Friday contest, putting together its first comeback effort of the weekend.
A pair of veterans—senior Anna McDonald and junior Leanna Coskren—gave the Crimson its scoring punch.
“The upperclassmen are setting an excellent example,” Stone said.
Unlike the Cornell battle, the game was a low-scoring affair, with all of the goals coming in the second period.
Colgate senior Evan Minnick was first on the board, scoring at 5:32 in the second period, but Kessler made 29 saves to prevent any further scoring from the Raiders.
“Kessler’s a great goalie,” Bassett said. “One of the [top] goalies in the country.”
Kessler downplayed her individual performance, crediting her defense for preventing Colgate from getting good looks at the net.
“All of the shots came from the outside,” Kessler said. “They didn’t have a lot of opportunities inside.”
Kessler and the defense gave Coskren and McDonald time to rally the Crimson. Coskren reached the back of the net first, scoring at 11:17 in the second period. Eight and a half minutes later, McDonald scored the game-winner.
Coskren and Farni, who had two assists against Cornell, are both defensemen.
“Everyone is going to need to contribute,” Farni said. “As the season goes on, I think you’ll see a lot of people putting up points.”
As the league schedule progresses, Harvard will have to adjust to a growing level of parity in the ECAC, in which traditionally middle-of-the-pack teams like Cornell can no longer be taken for granted.
“We just have to keep working on getting better,” Stone said. “Individually and collectively, getting better every week and every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last season, the Crimson women’s volleyball team defeated Columbia in two meetings but lost to Cornell twice.
This season, Harvard had it out for the New York teams and entered each contest looking to prove that it is the better squad—and did so in a weekend sweep at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson (10-11, 6-4 Ivy) overcame Columbia (11-10, 2-6) on Friday night and shellacked Cornell (6-15, 3-7) on Saturday.
Harvard swept the season series versus both opponents, finishing 4-0 against the New York Ivies. These victories move the Crimson up to third place in the Ivy League standings.
HARVARD 3, CORNELL 0
The Crimson trampled the Big Red on Saturday, with set play of 25-21, 25-17, 25-18. The victory represented Harvard’s first season sweep of Cornell since 2002.
The Crimson had a well-balanced attack on Saturday, taking advantage of the Big Red offensively and defensively. Harvard had a 38-36 advantage over Cornell in kills, along with a 59-48 advantage in digs. Senior Lily Durwood notched 30 assists, and junior Mikaelle Comrie led the Crimson with 10 kills—giving her 31 for the weekend. Freshman Taylor Docter also had a big game, with nine kills, three aces, four digs, and four blocks, which Coach Weiss noted is what she is capable of doing consistently.
Defensively, sophomore Christine Wu, co-captain Chelsea Ono Horn, and senior Katherine Kocurek kept the Big Red from getting comfortable. Harvard trailed for the majority of the first set until two consecutive service aces by sophomore Anne Carroll Ingersoll pulled the Crimson ahead, 19-18. Cornell called a time-out to regroup, but during the next play, Wu made a diving save that kept the ball alive and led to a kill by Comrie. From there, the momentum completely shifted in Harvard’s favor.
“Our defense has always been very strong,” Wu said, “both at the net and in the back row. Once we do our jobs in the back row to get it our setter, then our hitters just have to dominate.”
The Crimson came out aggressively and won the first two sets but did not lose its focus in the third—a problem it had the night before.
HARVARD 3, COLUMBIA 2
In its first match of the weekend, Harvard faced Columbia, which entered Cambridge on a three-game losing streak.
Although the Crimson defeated the Lions 3-0 in its last match, Friday night proved to be a challenge for Harvard. The Crimson started strong, winning the first two sets 25-16 and 25-19, but Columbia fought back to win the third and fourth sets.
The contest was particularly close—the score was tied 25 times—during the third and fifth sets. The Lions matched Harvard’s intensity in the third set and were able to shift the momentum in their favor. When the score was tied at 18, Columbia generated a 5-0 run to win the set, 25-22.
By the fourth set, Columbia was clearly in a rhythm, and Harvard trailed for the entire set. The Crimson managed to tie the score twice but were never able to take a lead and lost the set 25-19.
“We were a little over-confident going into the third and fourth games,” Comrie said. “We weren’t necessarily responding very well, so we had to really step up our game and change our game plan.”
The Lions out-defended Harvard on the night, recording 11 team blocks to Harvard’s seven. Weiss responded to Columbia’s resurgence in the game by switching in her starting lineup, and the Crimson held on to win the final set in overtime, 16-14.
“[Columbia is] scrappy,” Comrie said. “We had to use all of our eggs to try and find a way to kill the ball.”
Comrie notched a career-high 21 kills against the Lions, while Ingersoll added 16 kills of her own along with five blocks. Docter and sophomore Sandra Lynne Fryhofer recorded 12 and 14 kills, respectively, and Durwood added to her 3,000-plus career assist total with 59.
Harvard has now won six of its last eight contests heading into next weekend, where it will face two more conference opponents: Yale and Brown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dartmouth men’s soccer team (8-5-1, 3-2 Ivy) came to Cambridge on a mission to reassert itself as the Ivy League’s top team after entering into a tie with Brown following last week’s loss to Columbia. Accompanied by a legion of costumed fans, the No. 21 Big Green came from New Hampshire hoping to beat No. 14 Harvard (11-3-1, 3-1-1) on its home field on Saturday.
But the Crimson, coming off an upset loss itself, wanted some revenge of its own.
Senior defender Kwaku Nyamekye took matters into his own hands, scoring his first goal of the season to spark Harvard’s 2-1 defeat of the Big Green.
“Kwaku was brilliant,” Crimson coach Jamie Clark said. “He’s a defender, but he comes over for set pieces, and he’s good for one shot a game. So we talked about it, and it managed to work.”
It only took 4:42 for Nyamekye to break the longest score-free stretch of his career—his last goal coming last Nov. 8 against Columbia.
“It’s great to finally score,” the senior said. “I knew it’d come at some point...I’m really happy.”
Nyamekye, brought up top for a corner-kick play, received a pass from senior Adam Rousmaniere and drilled the ball into the right side of the goal.
“Every goal takes a little pressure off our team,” he said.
The goal proved to be critical, as the Big Green dominated the ball for the rest of the half. Junior Alex Chi worked hard in the midfield to send the ball up, but senior forward Andre Akpan and freshman forward Brian Rogers were stifled by Dartmouth’s physical defense. Clashes sent Akpan to the ground on a few occasions, and the co-captain seemed to be looking for penalties to be called.
Meanwhile, Dartmouth’s strikers Austin Bowers, Kevin Dzierzawski, and Maarten van Ess were pressuring the Crimson defense and goalie Austin Harms through the end of the first half and into the second. Though the defense was able to keep the ball away from the goal, it seemed only a matter of time before Dartmouth found the back of the net.
The Big Green’s lucky moment came at 55:26, when sophomore Lucky Mkosana fired the ball past Harms off an assist from classmate van Ess. The Crimson had held off two offensives before the goal, but it was unable to clear the ball past midfield.
Perhaps that goal was the wake-up call Harvard needed, as it registered the next three shots of the game. The first one came from Chi at 60:42. Two minutes later, the Crimson was back on top, thanks to the combined efforts of its co-captains.
Midfielder Brian Grimm kicked the ball far down the field to the right side.
Akpan was waiting for it, but so were two Big Green defenders, both of whom were to his inside. Controlling the ball, the forward quickly reversed direction and beat the first defender to the inside, firing the ball to the opposite corner before the second could touch him.
“[Akpan] scored a brilliant goal,” Clark said. “He always makes a little run. It’s a bit of class to actually beat the guy.”
The goal puts Akpan just two goals shy of the all-time career scoring mark, currently held by Chris Ohiri ’64.
A minute and a half later, it looked like the Crimson would go up one more, but Rogers’ shot hit the crossbar, and Dartmouth defenders boxed him out for the rebound.
The freshman’s effort proved to be the Crimson’s last shot of the game. The Big Green regained its control of the ball and, just as in the first half, Harvard relied on its defense to deliver the victory.
“We expected them to put a lot of pressure on us,” Nyamekye said.
The defense was up to the challenge. Missed opportunities by the Big Green certainly didn’t hurt, as Dartmouth forwards had four shots miss the goal near the end of the game. But the Big Green hounded the ball, and just as before, it seemed a matter of time before one went their way. When the ball finally went past Harms, it seemed for a split second that the score would be tied.
But Nyamekye had other ideas, clearing the ball before it broke the plane.
“Every time we needed something won in the air [or] cleared, [Nyamekye was there],” Clark said. “And kind of a cherry on top, he scores a goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even nature couldn’t defeat the Harvard women’s soccer team, which found itself in a 1-1 tie in the second half on Saturday at Ohiri Field, fighting both Dartmouth and a 29 mph wind.
But the Crimson (8-6-1, 5-1 Ivy) was undeterred, and in the 87th minute notched the go-ahead goal to hold off the Big Green (8-7, 3-3) for the 2-1 win and, more importantly, for the Ivy League championship.
“It feels absolutely amazing to come back and be Ivy League champions again,” junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh said. “Absolutely amazing.”
Sheeleigh scored both goals for Harvard, and while she insisted that her game-winning goal “just slipped in,” head coach Ray Leone was quick to praise.
“She’s got a knack.” Leone said. “She is so mentally tough that you just can’t take this kid out of the game. She’s a winner.”
Dartmouth scored first for an early lead in the seventh minute when Big Green forward Aly O’Dea—her team’s leading scorer—headed a cross from the left past Crimson goalkeeper Lauren Mann.
“We’ve been down before and come back,” co-captain Lizzie Nichols said. “We just brought everyone in and just said, ‘Listen, relax.  We have almost an entire game left. Let’s just play our game.’”
Sheeleigh made her presence known with the equalizer in the 20th minute, when, after a well-placed corner kick, she found the loose ball and launched it into the net. Harvard continued to get chances, but converting them proved difficult, and the Crimson ended the first half tied 1-1.
In the second half, Harvard shifted to defend the downwind side in a rapidly rising gale.  Any clearing attempts were stuffed by the winds, and Dartmouth kept the pressure on accordingly.
“Our defense and [goalkeeper] Lauren Mann really kept us in the game, they were amazing,” Sheeleigh said. “It was a struggle. The wind was very, very strong.”
The Big Green came tantalizingly close to taking the lead but couldn’t seem to finish.
“We huffed and puffed and dinked the post and the crossbar and just couldn’t get it in there,” said Dartmouth head coach Angie Hind.
In the 87th minute, Sheeleigh got an opportunity for the Crimson, taking a pass from the right directly in front of the Big Green net and spinning it just out of the reach of the off-balance goalie. It was her fourth game-winning goal of the season.
The match was a battle from start to finish, as both teams had seven corner kicks, and both goalies had four saves. Dartmouth outshot Harvard 15-12.
“The game was everything it was built up to be,” Leone said. “Dartmouth was unbelievable.  They played as good as we thought they were going to play, and we had to match that.”
When the final buzzer sounded, the team stormed the field in excitement.  The league title-clinching win was particularly sweet after the 1-5-1 start that the team had.
“[It’s] unbelievable,” Nichols said. “After the BU game in the middle of our season, we had to come together because we were having a rough start.  We just looked each other in the eye to say, ‘I believe in this team, and we’re going to do it this year, and we fought through every game’…I’m so proud of this team.”
“Once we started doing bad, it kind of snapped them out,” Leone added. “Day by day they got better and better.  We were starting from scratch when we were starting the Ivy League [schedule].”
The Crimson is Ivy League champion for the second year in a row and for the ninth time overall.
“Last year was the first time in a long time that we’ve won,” Nichols said. “This time really shows our character because we were able to repeat.”
With a game left in the league schedule, the team is guaranteed at least a tie for the Ivy championship as well as the accompanying NCAA tournament berth, since it holds the tie-breaker over Yale.
Harvard now has an extra week to focus on preparing for the post-season—a luxury compared to 2008, when the championship was decided in the final game of the year.
“To do it in game six is really a dream come true,” Leone said. “Now we have to put this game behind us and focus on just improving.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a season of individual accomplishments and strong team showings, the Harvard cross country teams did not disappoint at the Heptagonal Championships this Friday. The men’s and women’s squads traveled to Van Cortlandt Park in New York and emerged with the first individual men’s title and highest women’s finish since 1995.
The women’s team finished second, while the men earned sixth in the squads’ final tune-up before NCAA regionals in two weeks.
According to players and coaches, the Crimson women derive much of their success from their consistency up and down the lineup.
“We just have so much depth right now,” junior captain Jamie Olson said. “There are about 20 seconds between our second girl and our sixth girl…In any given race, you don’t know where you are going to be within the team, and that’s a huge thing.”
Harvard certainly maintained this consistency over the weekend, as all five scorers finished in the top 20. Junior Claire Richardson notched another personal best, crossing the line in 17:28 for sixth overall. Rookie Sammy Silva finished 12th in 17:53.7, with junior Eliza Ives, sophomore Nicole Cochran, and sophomore Kailyn Kuzmuk completing the effort. Kuzmuk’s time of 18:10.6 left only 16.9 seconds between the Crimson’s second and fifth runner.
Unfortunately for Harvard, while the solid pack limited the score to a respectable 69 points, the team could not keep pace with No. 4 Princeton. The Tigers claimed the top five spots in the race, leaving little doubt as to which squad dominates the Ivy League.
“We would have liked to have broken [Princeton] up a bit and not let them have that perfect score,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “But you have to tip your hat to them. They are a very, very talented squad, and they came to take care of business.”
Behind the Tigers and Harvard, Columbia had 75 points, followed by Cornell, Brown, Dartmouth, Penn, and Yale.
On the men’s side, junior Dan Chenoweth continued a stellar year for the Crimson, as he dominated another Ivy League field to finish first. The third-year runner posted a 25:09.2 on the 8K course, 10.5 seconds better than his closest competitor, Brown’s Christian Escareno. Chenoweth’s 5:01 mile pace was impressive on paper, but Saretsky praised his top runner’s intangible skills even more.
“[Chenoweth] is a great competitor,” Saretsky said. “He had to dig deep and battle, and the race was won up cemetery hill. It was kind of fitting to have it come down to the most grueling part of the course, because he is such a hard worker.”
Despite being the favorite entering the race, Chenoweth agreed with his coach that a win was not guaranteed.
“Things clicked a little bit, but I didn’t have [the race] wrapped up at any point,” he said. “Until I crossed the line I was like, ‘keep going, keep going,’ and it was a great relief once I got there.”
Behind Chenoweth, the Crimson relied once again on a young core of runners to round out its scoring. Freshman Phil Galebach earned 29th overall in 26:21.7, followed by junior Ryan Neely, freshman Jeremy Gilmour, and sophomore Michael Hoffman. Chenoweth praised the effort of his younger teammates, some of whom have contributed much more than expected early in their careers.
“I think that it’s been good to see those [younger] guys step up,” Chenoweth said. “Coming in, we thought we’d be a little more experienced, but with the injuries we’ve had, we didn’t know where the scores would be coming from. Those guys have been great, though. It’s tough for freshmen at the longer distance, but they’ve been key to our success.”
According to Saretsky, Chenoweth has reason to be proud of his teammates’ effort, as the junior standout’s work ethic has contributed to their improvement.
“[Chenoweth] is one of the most diligent runners on the team,” Saretsky said. “His dedication and commitment are a great inspiration for other guys.”
Still, the Harvard men have room for improvement among their Ivy foes. Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth, and Brown all finished ahead of the Crimson, leaving Yale and Penn in the final two spots.
“It was a good day for us, but we were hoping to get a little higher,” Chenoweth said. “It wasn’t crazy great, but we managed to overcome some small difficulties and hold it together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Competing during a holiday that thrives off of fear, the Harvard men’s tennis team was not intimidated in the Harvard Halloween Tennis Tournament over the weekend, recording eight wins overall in singles and doubles play. Co-captain Michael Hayes and freshman Tunc Kiymaz reached the finals in their respective A and B  singles flights.  The tournament was played in spite of a number of illnesses and injuries that plagued the Crimson squad.
“We were not as healthy as we would’ve liked to have been this weekend,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “The colds and minor injuries just come with this time of the season.”
But the show must go on.
Five Crimson players competed in Flight A singles, with two reaching the quarterfinals and Hayes making the final round. Sophomore Davis Mangham made a run to the singles quarterfinals, defeating Darthmouth’s Andrew Malizia, 6-4, 6-1, and eventually falling to the Big Green’s No. 1 contender Dan Freeman, who went on to win Flight A.
Hayes’ trip to the finals had a rocky beginning. The senior played in a three-set match in the first round before gaining momentum in later matches. He defeated Dartmouth’s Chris Ho, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4, in the first round, the Big Green’s Curtis Roby, 7-6, 6-3, in the quarterfinals, and Brown’s Andrew Yazmer, 6-7, 6-2, 10-6, in the semifinals before losing to Freeman 6-4, 6,4 in the final round of Flight A.
Hayes’ performance was a highlight of the Halloween tournament.
“This was the best Mike has played in the last two seasons,” Fish said. “He played a close match against the best Dartmouth player and really played superb tennis.”
Another strong performance came from newcomer Tunc Kiymaz, who, like Hayes, reached the final round of his flight before losing to a talented Dartmouth contender. In his path to the final round, Kiymaz defeated MIT’s Brian Oldfield, 6-4, 6-7, 6-1, in the first round and Brandeis’ Steven Nieman, 7-5, 6-4.  The Big Green’s Kevin Cox won Flight B after beating Kiymaz, 6-1, 6-1.
“Tunc has done a really good job this season and in this tournament especially,” Fish said.  “He’s an extremely hard worker and continues to get better on a daily basis.”
Kiymaz sees the tournament as a chance to gain experience for the upcoming season.
“Getting my first few wins under my belt definitely builds up my confidence,” Kiymaz said. “For me, being able to play in the tournament was a great opportunity to play against big hitters in the conference.”
In doubles play, sophomore Mac McAnulty and Kiymaz fell in the first round to Brandeis duo Steven Nieman and Nick White, 8-2, while Hayes and Mangham reached the semifinal round before being overcome by Freeman and Malizia of Dartmouth, 9-8 (7-4).
Although the tournament did not produce ideal results, it provided the chance to grow as a team and prepare for the spring season.
“The point of the tournament was for our guys to get more play,” Fish said. “Our season is all about building and comes down to the Ivy dual matches in April.”
“This weekend gave us the chance to see some Ivy competition,” Kiymaz said. “We competed against Dartmouth and Brown and got to see those players again before conference season.”
For the Harvard team, success will come from continued training before spring conference play.
“The guys need to continue working hard,” Fish said. “Results for our season depend on what [the players] do in the upcoming period until January.”
Once the injuries and illnesses subside, wins may come more easily for the Crimson.
“We’re excited to see how me match up when we’re at full strength,” Kiymaz said. “With all of our guys back and healthy, we’ll be able to see who really is the best and hopefully come out strong in the spring season.”
“This was a good last competition in the fall before we start working individually for conference,” Fish said. “And so far, we like what we see.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Too little, too late is becoming a trend for the Harvard field hockey team.
After getting outscored, 11-0, in the first half of its past two losses against No. 4 Princeton and No. 9 Boston College, the Crimson (5-10, 2-4 Ivy) let Dartmouth (9-7, 4-2) gain a 4-2 advantage in its last conference home game of the season, and a late rally couldn’t hold off the Big Green. Harvard fell, 5-3, dropping its sixth game out of its past seven and ensuring a losing record in conference play.
“I think that we had trouble recovering from Dartmouth’s string of first half goals,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “Our momentum improved in the second half, but we were unable to recover from first-half mistakes.”
It was a similar script this week coming off two tough losses against top-10 teams, but Harvard failed to take advantage of its opportunity to pull even with the Big Green in the Ivy League standings.
Freshman goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos continued her solid work between the pipes with eight saves, but the Crimson simply didn’t have an answer for Dartmouth’s deep offense—five different Big Green players scored the team’s goals.
Harvard fell behind early, as a Dartmouth cross found the back of the net to give the Big Green a 1-0 lead at the 2:32 mark. Dartmouth extended its lead when Kelly Hood—second in the Ivy League in points—scored on a penalty corner. Crimson freshman Emma Keller cut the deficit in half roughly midway through the first frame when she knocked in the rebound from sophomore Pilar Mayora’s long shot that deflected off Dartmouth’s goalie.
The Big Green scored two goals within three minutes to take a 4-1 lead at the 23:54 mark of the half. Harvard’s attack was strong throughout the first half, and it wasn’t two minutes before Dickson took a corner insertion from co-captain Elizabeth Goodman-Bacon and fired a low shot past the goalie to cut the deficit to 4-2.
The Crimson continued to put the Big Green in tough situations through the end of the first half. Harvard racked up five shots and a penalty corner within 40 seconds towards the end of the frame, but several blocks and a high Dickson shot that was nicely gloved for a save prevented the Crimson from cutting the deficit further before intermission.
Both squads followed the action-packed first frame with tough defense to open the second half.  After a couple of errant Big Green shots, freshman Katelin Wahl could not have picked a better time to notch her first collegiate goal when she knocked in a shot off a penalty corner to bring Harvard within one goal.
While Dartmouth’s defense showed up in the second half, holding the Crimson to just three shots, Harvard had several chances to even the score.
“We were able to settle into a rhythm in the second half,” junior Pilar Curtis said. “We generated stronger offense and scoring opportunities, but we were unable to overcome Dartmouth’s first-half lead.”
Two missed opportunities late in the game sealed the Crimson’s fate. Dickson’s strike with five minutes left in the game was blocked by the defense, and Dartmouth’s Jessica Stearns saved freshman Nina Kucharczyk’s shot at the 67:33 mark.
With less than a minute to go, Tassopoulos made three-consecutive saves, but the Big Green was able to put the game out of reach when a rebound shot made it past Tassopoulos with twenty seconds left in the game to make it 5-3.
“I think that we had trouble recovering from Dartmouth’s string of first half goals,” Bannon said. “Our momentum improved in the second half, but we were unable to recover from first half mistakes.”
The Crimson will welcome New Hampshire to Jordan Field on Tuesday evening at 6:00 p.m. for its home finale.
“Going into our last week of play,” Bannon said, “we will work on minimizing our opponent’s opportunities through better circle defense and work to capitalize on our offense play.”

Serving Harvard Square for 27 years, tonight, Herrell's Ice Cream closes its doors at last.
In September, FlyBy, like many who once frequented the Dunster Street mom-and-pop ice cream parlor, was devastated to return from the summer to see the sign announcing Herrell's impending departure in the storefront. Apple pie and a scoop of ice cream almost certainly went down well with a late-night pset, often worth the extra walk from Mass Ave. for a little bit of Harvard Square history.
Told it was Herrell's last day open, FlyBy tried to reach by 9:00 PM, only to be turned away by the closing staff as the parlor's first customers rejected in 27 years. While not the last customer served, FlyBy prides itself instead on being the first customer permanently unable to buy homemade ice cream on Dunster Street in 27 years.
With one less eating eatery in the Square, it is unclear what Harvard students will do for the time being until 15 Dunster St. reopens in the spring. As Herrell's storefront announces, the space promises to reopen in "early spring 2010" as "First Printer Restaurant, Bar, and Grill," commemorating Stephen Daye's first printing press in the British Americas, back in 1638. As a hat tip to Herrell's well-established customer base, First Printer has promised to have "frozen desserts" on its menu.
In the meantime, FlyBy is sifting through a wallet full of void purple "Boomerang Gift Certificates," good for $1 off on any next visit to Herrell's, saddened by Herrell's obvious debt default...

Galactic. Bela Fleck and the Flecktones. Slightly Stoopid. You haven't heard of them either, right?
The College Events Board opened up a poll this past weekend to get your input on who to feature at this year's Yardfest, an annual spring festival headlined last year by electronica Ratatat and one-hit-wonder Sara Bareilles.
When FlyBy took a look at the artists considered to be "within the CEB's price range," though, we couldn't help but scratch our heads in puzzlement. Peter Bjorn and John? !!!(Chick Chick Chick)? Del the Funky Homosapien?
"We didn't come up with them off the top of our heads," admits James A. McFadden '10, CEB vice-chair and a Crimson editorial writer. "There's definitely plenty of those I haven't thought of either." More after the jump.
The list came from a company called Pretty Polly Productions, an agency that many New England colleges use to book acts. McFadden emphasized that making the list available to students adds transparency to the whole artist-choosing process, even if many of the artists contribute to what he called "our '90s washed-up band reputation."
FlyBy, though, has managed to find plenty of gems in Pretty Polly's proposal, whether you're longing for your elementary school days (Hanson), a Latin rock buff (Los Lonely Boys), or just a fan of dances everyone knows how to do (Soulja Boy), and because of how many performers are on the list, there's sure to be someone you like.
"I think we're really happy with it," McFadden said. "There's a large number of [artists], but I think we got a wide variety of them."
"We all would love to have Kanye and Taylor Swift or whatever, but we're happy that it's a realistic set of choices," he said.
The poll will be open until Friday evening and is available here.

A major decline in the endowment. Budget cuts. Layoffs. Whiny students. Admittedly, these phrases don't look so nice next to Harvard's prestigious name.
Tough economic times have hurt Harvard's typically favorable public image, leading to a 20 percent decline in media representations of Harvard over the past nine months, according to The Global Language Monitor, a site that recently brought you the "Top Politically (in)Correct Words and Phrases of the Past Year" (number 1 was Swine Flu, FYI). We get that cutbacks don't exactly make Harvard look good, but how did they translate that into a number like 20 percent? Regardless, the site ranked Harvard as the university with the third best media image this year, a drop from the number one spot it held during the site's two previous incarnations of the rankings.
In place of Harvard, Global Language Monitor said that this year our Cambridge neighbor MIT had the best image in the media. Number two? University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. That one we really don't understand. (Maybe no press is good press?)
If is makes you feel better, Yale was ranked 11th.

Here's a true pearl of wisdom (no pun intended--we promise) for the foodie and the luxury-lover alike. Rialto, Chef Jody Adams's swanky restaurant in the Charles Hotel, is now offering $1 oysters on Monday nights in the bar.
Oysters may not be FlyBy's favorite food--they can often be slimy, eel-like, and, well, eel-like. (Yeah. Like Flotsam and Jetsam in The Little Mermaid. Eeeew.) But, given the very reasonable price and a good excuse to enjoy an evening out at somewhere other than Oggi, the Upper Crust, or, God forbid, the Kong, FlyBy is willing to consider and give it a try.
More details after the jump.
Head down to one of Cambridge's nicest hotels this evening--and other Monday evenings--for your rare chance to find a sweet deal in this expensive part of town. According to the Rialto Website, Oyster service begins in the bar at 5:30 p.m. and continues until "the last oyster is shucked," whatever that means. Head on down!
