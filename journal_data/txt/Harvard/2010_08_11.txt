After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students applying to Harvard this fall will be required to submit two SAT Subject Test scores, one fewer than the number required of applicants in previous years.
This change, along with Georgetown’s decision to “strongly recommend” rather than require the submission of three Subject Test scores, marks the end of a three-Subject Test requirement at any university in the nation, according to a National Association for College Admission Counseling report.
Dean of Admission and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the decision—which was made in March by a faculty committee and will affect students vying for spots in the Class of 2015—was arrived at based on a review of the validity of the writing portion of the standard SAT in predicting students’ grades at Harvard.
Fitzsimmons said that the writing test has proven to be “just as good a predictor” of students’ grades at Harvard as another SAT Subject Test.
Before the writing test was introduced in 2005, Harvard required a total of five scores on an 800-point scale from applicants—results from the math and critical reading sections of the SAT, along with three Subject Tests.  The advent of the SAT writing section temporarily increased that number to six before the latest change in Harvard’s policy.
Some Harvard hopefuls said they viewed the new policy as an indication that the Admissions Office will be giving less weight to standardized tests.
“I though maybe Harvard was taking the emphasis off of standardized testing,” said Akaash N. Gupta, a high school senior who plans to apply to Harvard this fall, of his initial reaction to the news that the College will now only require two Subject Test scores.
Katherine Y. Wang, Gupta’s classmate at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Virginia, agreed.
“I’m thinking they’re just not relying as much on standardized testing,” Wang said.
But Fitzsimmons said the change is not a reflection of a depreciation of standardized testing but the implementation of a new arrangement that resembles its pre-writing test policy.
In terms of the number of tests Harvard requires of its applicants, “we’re right back where we were before,” he said.
Despite the decrease in mandatory scores, Fitzsimmons said that he expects some students will submit more scores than are required.
Wang, for example, said she has already taken four of the tests—Math II, Chinese, Biology, and Chemistry.
“They just lined up with my classes,” she said. “I might just submit all four.  I’m pretty happy with them.”
Evan C. Ramsey, a senior at a public high school in California who has already taken three Subject Tests, applauded Harvard’s new policy and said that the change may affect his decision on which scores to submit.
“I’m very happy,” Ramsey said of the new policy. “It wouldn’t completely shatter my hopes if three were required, but it’s kind of nice not to have to worry about that third.”
Ramsey said that since he expected to be required to submit three scores, he started taking the tests during his sophomore year, when he says he was not well enough prepared to score highly on these tests.  He said that two tests is a more reasonable expectation for students.
“It’s good that they’re lowering the requirement,” he said, adding that AP tests and class grades already fulfill a similar evaluative function. “You can see the type of student a person is from two of them—or none at all.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just three weeks left before classes begin, the pilgrimage back to Cambridge has begun. Preseason for varsity athletes begins next week, but this correspondent has already returned to Massachusetts after a summer abroad in South Africa. Having left vuvuzelas and rabid drunken soccer fans behind, it’s time to focus on the season ahead: and that means football.
The Ivy League held its annual football media day on Tuesday, and, once again, Harvard is tabbed to finish on top. It’s the Crimson’s fourth such honor in the last five seasons, but although the squad got the lion’s share of the first-place votes (10 out of 17), it only finished four points ahead of predicted runner-up Penn, the defending Ancient Eight champions.
Harvard also has the predicted Ivy League offensive and defensive players of the year, according to college football guru Phil Steele. Steele named rising senior running back Gino Gordon and captain safety Collin Zych as the league’s preseason best on each side of the ball. But the Quakers boast 15 returning starters—though only five from a defense that was tops in the FCS last season—and Brown has the best returning quarterback in Kyle Newhall-Caballero.
Meanwhile, the Crimson may begin the season with a former LSU starting quarterback as a backup to rising senior signal-caller Collier Winters, as Andrew Hatch has been cleared by the NCAA to play for Harvard this season. Take that, Ancient Eight.
In other news, rising Penn sophomore Isabel Han is looking to make her mark on the national level after a successful rookie season on the links. The golfer has advanced to match play at the U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship, shooting a seven-over 151 through two rounds at the Charlotte Country Club in North Carolina. Han, who was in a six-way tie for 64th, won the six-way playoff for the final match play spot and will play Rachel Rohanna, who was tied for first after two rounds, Wednesday morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team has been getting some major love this past week. Just a day after the Harvard Athletic Department announced that the Crimson’s contest against Princeton on Oct. 24 will be nationally televised on ESPNU, the National Soccer Coaches Association of America preseason poll was released with Harvard holding down the No. 10 spot in the nation.
The Crimson, which won last year’s Ivy League championship, is the lone representative from the Ancient Eight in the top 25. Last season, Harvard flirted with a top-10 ranking, reaching as high as No. 6 in the polls, before disappointing setbacks against Wake Forrest, Cornell, and UConn dropped the Crimson lower. But Harvard recovered from its early disappointments, finishing 5-1-1 in conference play and earning itself a spot in the NCAA tournament, where the Crimson reached the Sweet 16.
While Harvard returns 19 players from last year’s roster, the Crimson will be forced to take on a new identity in 2010 due to a couple of key departures. Harvard has lost its top goal scorer, Andre Akpan '10, and defensive weapon, Kwaku Nyamekye '10, to graduation. Also gone is last season’s head coach, Jamie Clark, who left Cambridge in June to take the head coaching position at Creighton.
But with the return of last season’s Ivy League Rookie of the Year Brian Rogers and under the new leadership of coach Carl Junot, the Crimson will look to defend its No. 10 ranking in the coming months. Harvard has a difficult non-conference schedule lined up, featuring four contests against opponents in the preseason top 25. The Crimson kicks off the 2010 season on Sep. 4 at home against No. 13 Stanford.
