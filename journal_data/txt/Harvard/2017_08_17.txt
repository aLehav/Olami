After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Audre Lorde reminds us that “we were never meant to survive,” not in “the mouth of the dragon we call America.” What this means is that the degradation and dehumanization of black bodies in this country is not an unlikely coincidence, or even an unfortunate side effect of America. America the free has always and intentionally been “free, but not for you.” This means that August 12’s Tiki torches and cars driven through crowds and Stars and Bars and “white lives matter” and blood on the streets of an American university, American death at the hands of Americans, come from the same anger that has run through America’s blood since the beginning, the anger that is our birthright and our original sin, the anger that we loathe even as it defines us. The anger of whiteness, written in the blood and tears of blacks on those university streets.
All this is to say that Charlottesville is nothing new, and you should’ve seen it coming.
It’s childish to say “We told you so.” I don’t mean to make my white reader feel guilty. I’m much more worried for myself and all other black bodies currently sitting in the dragon’s mouth than your conscience; will we get out alive? No, my point here is to point out a fact that we all keep forgetting and will doom us to this anger forever unless we come to terms with it (and by we I mean the collective and national conscience of America). The fact is this: This is who we are and who we have always been.
Today I drove with my family from Maryland to North Carolina. We ate lunch in a diner, and across the street was a flagpole, and on top of the flagpole was the Confederate flag, and it was very windy so the flag snapped and stood at attention. From where I sat eating, if I simply raised my head the flag was directly in my line of sight. Every time I looked up from my meal, I was reminded of that anger. It filled my belly.
That same flag waved over Charlottesville today, and waves over backyard barbeques and lynching trees and city halls. It waves for Dylan Roof and the United Daughters of the Confederacy and David Duke. America, this flag is ours. It’s been in our blood, if not on our flag posts, for four hundred years. Don’t be surprised when it manifests itself—not for the first time, and almost certainly not for the last—in death. As long as America holds its anger and spits it at black bodies, that flag will wave.
The point is that how we handle Charlottesville is incredibly important. What we say next matters, because it can lead to either change or complacency, acceptance, or denial. When President Trump (like it or not, he is America’s president; own that too) writes that “There is no place for this kind of violence in America,” he is clearly mistaken. America is literally built on this kind of violence. The anger this kind of violence comes from has kept America’s heart beating from slave ship to cotton field to lynching trees to ghettos to private prisons to Charlottesville. There is a place for this kind of violence in the mouth of the dragon, and that’s the whole point.
But we continue to deny, reject, obfuscate. Neither President Trump, nor the president of UVA, nor the Mayor of Charlottesville mentioned “white supremacy” or “white nationalism” or “KKK” or “white” once, and in doing so erase the specificity and reality of the situation (Mayor Signer gets points for just mentioning “racism”). This erasure is precisely what allows President Trump to condemn “hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides,” and thus cover up the fact that Charlottesville happened because of America’s history of white nationalist supremacy. Covering up the reality then covers up the possibility of solving it; how can we fix what we cannot understand? Deny, reject, obfuscate. We hide the dragon, but that doesn’t make it any less hungry.
Do not let Charlottesville be made into something special, something new. It is painfully mundane and as old as America. Learn our history: 12.5 million Africans were displaced in total by the Atlantic slave trade, and around two million died just on the trip over. Learn our present: From 1995 to 2012, over 88,000 racist hate crimes were reported (reported: the tip of the iceberg). Realize that Charlottesville was bound to happen, President Trump or not, and do not be surprised by the next one. Because as long as that flag still flies in the hearts of white Americans, black Americans will suffer. We were never meant to survive.
Do not, though, let Charlottesville appear unavoidable; we are not condemned to it. Our fate is in our hands; America is in our hands. Our anger does not own us. How we react to Charlottesville has the potential to be a step in the right direction. But until our past has been reconciled with and our present is accepted, the future is one of Black blood and tears running in American streets—the Charlottesvilles yet to come.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What exactly makes a woman “wife material”—someone who is worthy of a man’s lifelong love and commitment? This topic recently came up in a Facebook group of which I’m a member. A woman who was talking to a man she met online posed this question to the group of fellow women: Even though she was extremely sexually attracted to him, should she abstain from having sex with him in order to show that she’s worthy of being his girlfriend, or perhaps even his wife one day?
Many women jumped to answer her question, advising her to wait anywhere from three dates to “as long as you can.” These answers are not unfamiliar to me. Growing up, I had received similar advice from television shows, magazines, and even other women. I was told to wait three dates—or better, five, or even better, eight—before having sex with a man. I was told to make him wait as long as you can, because if you have sex with him too soon, he will lose all respect for you. After all, “why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?”
One woman in the Facebook group commented that, based on how long a woman waits to have sex with a man, he will put her in one of three categories: one night stand, friend with benefits, or wife material. So, she advised the original poster: If you truly want him to see you as wife material, you have to tease him. Make him work for it. Dangle a carrot in front of his eyes. Hold out for as long as you can, and make him chase you.
According to all of these pieces of advice, sex is nothing more than a prize that a woman gives to a man to reward him for his time, his attention, and his persistence. Is it any wonder, then, that idiotic concepts like the “friend zone” persist, where men feel entitled to have sex with a woman just because he spent time with her and paid attention to her when she was talking? And is it any wonder that men pursue women relentlessly even after she has said “no,” thinking that “no” doesn’t really mean “stay away from me,” but rather “try harder”?
These outdated standards of modesty that we tell women to conform to if they want to be seen as “wife material” are the exact same vehicles that drive rape culture. The idea that a woman has to say no to a man’s advances and run away from him just to see if he’s willing to chase her down goes hand in hand with the idea that a man should ignore a woman’s “no” and pursue her until she finally gives him what he wants.
When women are taught to say “no” to sex in order to keep a man interested, even when she actually wants to have sex with him, men learn that when a woman says “no” she is just playing hard to get. And when women are taught to use their bodies as a way to reward men for their time and attention, men learn to expect sexual access from women in exchange for a couple of dinner dates and a bouquet of roses—and subsequently get angry and potentially violent when they do all the “nice guy” things and still don’t get rewarded with sex.
But women continue adhere to the three-date rule in order to prove that they are, as the Facebook commenter said, “wife material”—a woman worthy of a man’s time, commitment, and respect. If she were to break the three-date rule and have sex with a man too soon, then she gets put into the category of “one night stand” instead. She is no longer a woman worthy of a man’s respect. She is a slut and a whore, and she is most definitely not worthy of being his wife—which is, naturally, what all women aspire to be.
It strikes me as funny that women constantly have to prove themselves to be wife material, while men are automatically assumed to be husband material. As a matter of fact, the sheer willingness to settle down and stop “sowing his wild oats” makes a man husband material. The bar is set extremely low. No matter how much philandering a man has done, no matter how irresponsible and immature he is, no matter how disgusting his bachelor pad is or how incapable he is of basic domestic tasks such as cooking and cleaning, men are always seen as deserving of a woman’s lifelong respect and commitment.
I am never going to judge whether or not a man is husband material based on the number of people he’s had sex with. But you can bet that I am going to judge him as not being husband material if he slut shames the women he sleeps with and expects them to adhere to arbitrary and outdated standards of modesty and celibacy that, for some reason, don’t apply to him.
A person’s worth isn’t tied to how many people they’ve slept with, or how long they wait before having sex. A person’s worth is reflected in how they treat other people. And ultimately, if you are a man who loses respect for a woman once she sleeps with you, that only reflects on your character rather than hers. “Women’s lives are not auditions to be your future wives,” and your inability to see women as autonomous human beings with sexual agency speaks volumes about how you are nowhere near ready to be a husband.

This is part one of a Flyby series with advice for the Class of 2021. Part two can be found here and part three here. Check back for future installments on cheap eats, Boston excursions, the best coffee spots, and so much more.
Harvard Square is brimming with food options, particularly in comparison to most college towns. But you’ll find that unless it’s someone’s birthday or you’re going on a date, many of the restaurants will be out of your price range. Luckily, the affordable food scene is vibrant and nuanced. From speedy lunch fare to late-night grease binges, Flyby has you covered.
So what are your choices? Think of it as a pyramid: The key food groups of the Square are burritos, pizza, burgers/breads/meats, ice cream, and The Kong. The pyramid is not designed to tell you what you should eat (it’s all basically unhealthy), but more of a breakdown of what you will eat.
If you’re worried about the Freshman (or Sophomore, Junior, or Senior) 15, don’t despair—consuming this food isn’t required. But you’ll probably get bored of the dining hall every once in awhile, and the pyramid will get you up to speed quickly.
THE FOUNDATION: BURRITOS
The number of burrito options in the Square has spiraled out of control in the last few years—two new national commercial outfits have entered what was already a crowded market. Sometimes you’ll feel like it’s hard to find cheap food that isn’t a burrito, so knowing your tortilla-wrapped meat and/or vegetables is essential for a prospective Square eater.
Qdoba and Chipotle are those big chains that you’ve probably heard of or sampled at some point. They’re not bad for a solid, calorific meal, and are practically mirror images in terms of store layout and ingredients (chicken, steak, rice, beans, salsa, etc.), though Chipotle’s slightly cheaper. Devotees will argue that Chipotle’s burritos taste significantly better, while others say there is little difference between the two. We come down somewhere in the middle—Chipotle’s meat seems to have a marinade that makes it slightly more flavorful, but the difference is often not enough to keep us from the several-blocks-closer Qdoba outpost. However, if you truly cannot decide, El Jefe’s, a new burrito joint near the Garage, is a perfect split between the two. It’s closer than Chipotle, and better than Qdoba—a perfect balance.
Felipe’s is the old-line, late-night, simple-and-tasty choice. The super burrito is a mouthwatering melange of basic ingredients prepared and rolled in under five seconds by a guy who will pay only passing attention to your requests to deviate from the basic recipe. Want black beans instead of pinto? Better say it loud, early, and often. Aside from the Ford assembly line-esque service, Felipe’s provides a generally delicious (if perhaps unhealthy) burrito experience. Heck, maybe he does know what you want in your burrito better than you do.
Border Cafe is one of the most popular restaurants in the Square, and as a consequence it’s adopted a hey-you-can-take-your-customer-service-and-shove-it attitude. Oh, are only four of the five people in your party here? We can’t seat you until the fifth arrives. What’s that you say about it being lunchtime on a Wednesday in the summer, and the restaurant being less than a quarter full? Next in line, please.
Aside from these quibbles, Border has an hour-long wait on most weekend nights for two key reasons: It has the twenty-something bar scene nailed down, and it serves the burro. The burro, while not technically a burrito, hits the spot like no other dish in the Square. It’s basically a burrito slathered in melted cheese and a little bit of enchilada sauce. While some complain that they can “still feel the burro the next day” and “feel like they’re sweating burro for weeks,” nothing will address hunger pangs like a burro. Nothing.
