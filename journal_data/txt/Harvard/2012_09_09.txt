After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cote K. Laramie ’14 loved words.
“We always used to play Bananagrams in the dining hall,” remembered Miruna Ioan ’14, a fellow Pforzheimer House resident and psychology concentrator. “If he was 100 percent on his game, no one could beat him.  He had a vocabulary that was unsurpassable.”
Laramie, a Bass I singer in the Harvard Glee Club and beloved Sigma Alpha Epsilon brother, took his life on Thursday at his home in Pembroke, N.H.
A poet and writer—his blockmates recall furious bursts that would ink through journals in a matter of days—Laramie was inspired by poets both classic and contemporary.
As a new Glee Club member his freshman fall, Laramie shared that he had won Poetry Out Loud, a national poetry-reading competition, as a fun fact about himself, Nicole M. Morreale ’13 recalled. When the two dated during her sophomore year, Laramie commonly recited poetry and played the guitar for her. That was his typical strategy with girls, his blockmates said, and they could often hear the strands of verse or chord from his bedroom.
“If I could have just one more minute, I would want him to play one more song,” said Laramie’s blockmate Patrick L. Johnson ’14. “He’d come over to my room sometimes last year, completely unannounced…. He’d just sit down and start playing. No words would need to be exchanged.”
In the second week of his freshman seminar, “Muslim Voices in Contemporary World Literature,” Cote sensed a musical chord in the traditional Koran recitations the class was studying. He decided to compose a piece of music for guitar around the chord.
Called “A Desert Wind,” the song “stunned” Ali S. Asani ’77, Laramie’s professor in the course.
“He wrote a whole commentary about this—a prophet in the desert receiving revelation and that this wind, wind for him represented the divine,” said Asani, who in the last two years has shared the music countless times to illustrate to professors and students the pedagogical power of art to bridge cultural understanding.
“Here is this freshman from New Hampshire, didn’t know anything about Islam, about Arabic, about the Middle East,” Asani said. “He takes this course and his very first class, he gets it.”
Friends say this profundity, openness to beauty, and intuitive empathy characterized Laramie’s approach to life throughout his time at Harvard.
“We’d sit in Lamont when we were supposed to do work and just talk about life for three, four hours,” said Iguosadolo O. Nosamiefan ’14, who met Laramie while studying French in the library one late night freshman year. “Philosophical questions, spiritual questions—that’s something I really valued about him.  A lot of people aren’t really willing to go into those deep conversations at a moment’s notice.”
For Laramie, the deep conversations were often the best ones. Known for his ability to talk—and listen—for hours, Laramie’s friends say he embraced the notion of being completely present for them. And in turn he was persistently thankful for the chance to talk, ending nearly every conversation with a sincere and gratified “Wow, thanks!” as blockmate Geoffrey Y. Lee ’14 remembered.
“He didn’t hold anything back,” said Johnson. “His personality and his presence in this House and on campus as a whole I think was really big.”
His blockmates recall that that extraordinary commitment extended to every pursuit he undertook, from an all-night session playing the video game StarCraft to four straight days spent watching “Breaking Bad” to writing out questions for professors before attending their office hours.
Laramie, Johnson, and Hilton R. Simmet ’14, another blockmate, took a camping trip in New Hampshire this summer. Simmet described Laramie’s home state as “lush,” “beautiful,” and “breathtaking.”
“I’m so glad that you got to come here to New Hampshire,” Simmet remembers Laramie saying, “because this is how my mind works. Buzzing and full and almost overstimulating.”
On reflection, his blockmates agreed it was an apt metaphor, as Laramie’s often were. They described Laramie’s almost childlike curiosity and his delight at meeting someone or learning something new. He spoke frequently of trying to better understand his own emotions.
“Talking to him sometimes would be exhausting” Lee said. “He would keep asking questions to the point where you’re not sure you really believed what you just said.”
Morreale chose “exuberant” as the best word to describe Laramie. “He had this unbridled joy about everything,” she said. “You couldn’t help but be happy when Cote was around.”
Ioan recalled a middle-school themed talent show in Pforzheimer where Laramie played the guitar and sang like a 12-year-old. “I laughed so hard I almost threw up,” she said. “He sang it in this 12-year-old voice, and it was so hilarious that everyone was just crying and my stomach was hurting. I don’t think I’ve ever laughed that hard in my entire life.”
Laramie’s own joy was always written on his face.
“He was never not smiling,” said Chelsea S. Link ’12.
Preston G. So ’14, another blockmate and a Crimson executive, said that Laramie’s trademark grin was recognizable on stage. “He was the one with the widest smile.”
Matthew C. Tufano ’13, student president of the Glee Club, said Laramie believed in the music he sang, and he filled up the room with his confidence.
“Watching him perform was one of the best experiences an audience member or the conductor could have,” Tufano said. “He loved, loved Glee Club.”
To Laramie, sound and self-expression—through poetry and music—were innately important. He wrote in an assignment for Asani’s class: “It is interesting to me how music can have very little structure or have immense structure yet the cause of it always seems to be some sort of expression important to the composer. Indeed humans learn the world through sound, a mother’s heartbeat, before they know anything of sight.  It’s that internal rhythm that I often find music speaking to, that almost unconscious memory, that simple sound.”
When Simmet filled out his freshman rooming questionnaire, he had a particular personality in mind. “I’m not looking for the typical do-everything Harvard student—I want someone who can look into the universe and see all its poetic beauty,” he remembered writing.
As he did for so many, Cote knew exactly how to fill the role. “There’s no way Harvard could have chosen a better roommate,” Simmet said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What a difference an offseason can make.
After concluding last fall with a disappointing sixth-place finish at the Heptagonal Championships, the Harvard women’s cross country team kicked off its 2012 campaign in winning fashion on Saturday. The Crimson dominated its competition and earned the team title at the Nassaney Invitational, hosted by Bryant University in Smithfield, R.I.
“I think it was a really great season opener for us,” said senior Briana Jackucewicz, who took first place in the women’s competition. “We had a tight pack up front and ran great times for our first race.”
Led by Jackucewicz, Harvard placed three runners in the top five en route to its comfortable team victory. Jackucewicz covered the five-kilometer race in 18:00.01, five seconds ahead of the second-place finisher.
Though Jackucewicz is one of only two seniors on the Crimson’s roster, the Nassaney invite was her first collegiate race. The native of Howell, N.J. has battled injuries that have kept her from competition for the past three seasons.
“Yesterday was a really special race for me,” Jackucewicz said. “I was able to go out and contribute to the team in a big way. The amount of support that I had from the team afterwards was incredible….  Everyone was really happy that I was finally able to do what I came to Harvard to do.”
On Saturday, the Crimson showed that its depth might be its strength this season, as each of its five scoring runners finished in the top 10. Junior Morgan Kelly and senior Samantha Silva took home fourth and fifth place at the invitational, respectively. Kelly was just 10 seconds behind Jackucewicz, running a 5:50 pace to finish in 18:10.4.
Rounding out the scoring positions for Harvard were sophomores Jennifer Guidera and Viviana Hanley. The pair of second-years took home eighth and ninth place, respectively. In addition to placing in the top 10, the Crimson’s scoring runners registered a stellar pack time—the amount of time between a team’s first and fifth finisher—of just 30 seconds.
“One of the big things that we really wanted to stress with the women’s team was running as a pack and working to tighten up our one-through-five spread,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I was really pleased to see them go out there and execute the plan.”
The race was held on a grass field at Bryant University. In the 5k women’s race, runners completed three loops on the field and a short stretch through a nearby wooded area.
“[The course] was flat, it was fairly fast, and we were able to go out there and get a good baseline in,” Jackucewicz said. “It was helpful to have an easier race to start off the season.”
On the men’s side, Harvard used the invitational as a way to give its harriers a chance to get some race experience under their belts before the season heats up.
Saretsky indicated that the majority of the men’s team ran only the first five kilometers of the eight-kilometer race, but were tightly packed and led by sophomore Lukas Gemar and freshman Billy Gaudreau.
“[The men’s team] did a really good job of working together over the first two miles and then pushing the last mile,” Saretsky said. “Overall, I was pleased with what they were able to get done, and I think it’s going to set them up for a strong season.”
Junior Erik Kraus was the only member of the Crimson to run the entire eight-kilometer race. Kraus finished in 57th place with a time of 27:54.2.
Though the invitational fielded a handful of schools from the New England area, Brown was the only other Ancient Eight squad in attendance. Harvard handily defeated the Bears in the women’s race, placing all five of its scoring runners ahead of Brown’s first finisher.
“[Winning the meet] was definitely a nice confidence boost,” Jackucewicz said. “This was a small invitational, but having five people within 30 seconds is what’s important. Even if you throw in other schools, we would have still been quite competitive.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team fell to an early 2-0 deficit in the first half, and Providence never looked back, ultimately defeating the Crimson, 3-0, Saturday afternoon in Providence, N.H.
Sophomore Steph Guglielmo netted the first goal for the Friars (2-2), scoring on a penalty corner in the 11th minute. Five minutes later, sophomore Henni Tietze doubled the lead for Providence, tallying another goal on the penalty corner.
"It’s hard to go down 2-0, but I think our team was still very confident," said Crimson sophomore forward Noel Painter. "It was still a game. We did our best to try to make it a game the entire match. We did what we could with the situation."
After each Providence score, Harvard worked to rebound quickly.
"We used a two-minute strategy after each goal," sophomore midfielder Caitlin Rea said. "We had two minutes to get back on it after a goal, that was kind of what we were after—high energy in the first two minutes after they scored."
But two early goals and a strong Friar defense made it difficult for the Crimson to stage any sort of comeback.
In the first half, Providence outshot Harvard, 9-0, and had eight penalty corners to the Crimson’s zero.
"They were able to take advantage of our mistakes that we made throughout the game in the forward line," Painter said. "Both teams had a lot of mistakes, but we were not able to capitalize on them like they were."
The Friars increased the lead in the second half, as sophomore Kaleigh Fitzpatrick scored off an assist from Tietze, putting Providence up by three.
In the last 15 minutes Harvard came on strong, with several penalty corners and no goals allowed, but was unable to put the finishing touch on any shots and overcome the early deficit.
The Crimson fared better in the second half than in the first, managing four penalty corners to the home team’s five.
Throughout the match, Harvard had a tough time breaking through the Friars’ defense, which limited scoring opportunities for the visitors.
"The [Providence] defense was stepping up quite well in front of us when we were transferring the ball from the defense and the midfield to the forwards," Rea said. "They broke down the forward line [and] were pretty strong in."
Rea had the most shots for the Crimson with three, including one on goal. Painter and sophomore midfielder Sydney Jenkins also contributed one shot each, both on goal as well.
"We weren’t able to get the rebounds and stuff the ball into the case,” Painter said. “That’s something that the forwards and the entire team really need to work on."
Overall, the Friars had 18 shots to Harvard’s five while taking 13 penalty corners to the Crimson’s four. Senior Kathi Weidman earned the shutout for Providence, saving three shots in her first win of the season.
Co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos had 11 saves in the losing effort as Harvard dropped its second straight game.
With four saves last weekend against Holy Cross and 11 on Saturday against the Friars, Tassopoulos passed Anya Cowan ’00 for third place on the program’s all-time saves list. She now has 425 saves on her career, passing Cowan’s 424.
Having saved 154 last year, Tassopoulos will look to continue moving up the charts as the season progresses.
"She was really on form, making saves and helping us on the corners," Rea said. "She gave us some great motivation before each shot was taken and really helped the defense stay motivated. She kept in us in the game."
Despite the loss, Harvard believes it can play more to its potential and compete with the best in the country.
"We’re looking to come out strong and confident. I think that we can beat [BC]," Painter said before Sunday’s 3-0 loss to the Eagles. "I think we can beat any team if we play our best. We’re just looking to go in with confidence and a winning attitude."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team picked up its first win of the season, downing Michigan State (1-3-1) in its home opener at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, 1-0. With the result, the Crimson defeated its first Big Ten opponent in over ten years and extended its winning streak in home openers to eight years.
Harvard scored in the 17th minute to take its first lead of the season and then maintained its clean sheet despite playing with a man down for the majority of the second half due to a red card.
Freshman forward Jake Freeman emerged as a strong front-line presence for Harvard, notching the game-winner. After collecting the ball in the defensive half, sophomore midfielder Matt Sheeleigh started the play, sending a pass up the right sideline.
Freeman raced against a Spartans defender, and when the ball bounced off his opponent he controlled it and launched a shot from the top of the box that put the Crimson on the scoreboard.
"We brought [Freeman] in because he is a goal scorer," Harvard coach Carl Junot said. "That is hopefully the first of many."
The Crimson maintained its lead throughout the first half, and both teams went into the break with two shots on goal. Michigan State’s most dangerous opportunity came early in the second half off a misplay by the Harvard defense. Freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez left the box to collect the ball with his feet, but a Spartans player picked off a long touch to have a clear look at the open net.
Mendez dove upon the ball before the forward could get a shot off, preventing a goal but picking up a red card in the process.
The Sparans were awarded a free kick, but did not convert.
"In the end, [Mendez] made a really good decision not to give up the goal," Junot said. "That was the difference between a win and a loss, so while it was a…mistake on his part, the decision to use his hands outside the box saved the game and turned out to be exactly the right one."
With a man down and thirty minutes left, Harvard shifted to a more defensive formation, and although Michigan State outshot the Crimson, 7-1, in the time remaining, the squad successfully held off the Spartans’ attacks to earn its first win of the season.
Co-captains Richard Smith and Scott Prozeller came up big defensively, recording  a number of timely tackles throughout the match.
"Whenever you go a man down and the run of play goes against you, you’ve got to rely on your leaders, and those guys were good," Junot said.
Harvard also stayed aggressive and maintained pressure on both offense and defense. The squad recorded 17 fouls to Michigan State’s 7 and topped the Spartans in corner kicks, 3-2.
To prepare for the contest, the Crimson emphasized capitalizing on offensive opportunities, and the team was particularly threatening on its counterattacks in Friday’s match.
"We spent a lot of time talking about serving the ball, crossing the ball, and finishing, and I thought we were pretty dangerous [in those areas]," Junot said. "Anytime you can jump on a team early, it makes it a little bit harder for them. They have to open up [and] attack more to try to get a goal back, so the counterattack against them becomes a bit easier. You saw that tonight, [and] we were very good on the counterattack."
Harvard’s defense was also strong, and although Michigan State ended the game outshooting the Crimson, 13-8, the Crimson trumped the Spartans with shots on goals, 4-3.
Mendez recorded two saves in the match, while freshman goalkeeper Joe Festa made one save in his first collegiate appearance to maintain the Crimson’s shutout.
"Michigan State was a good opponent, but ultimately our class managed to show through," Smith said. "It was unfortunate we went down a man, but the guys really dug deep…. We thoroughly deserved it. The boys worked hard. We are glad to come away with the win and a clean sheet."
