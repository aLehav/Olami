After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and long-time Harvard University Professor Oscar Handlin died of a heart attack on Sept. 20 at his home in Cambridge. He was 95 years old.
During a career that spanned well over 50 years, Handlin earned a reputation as one of the most influential historians in the United States and formidable professors at the University.
Handlin’s best-known book, “The Uprooted: The Epic Story of the Great Migrations that Made the American People,” earned him the 1952 Pulitzer Prize for History and was a watershed text in American historical scholarship. But it was his clear, accessible style backed by rigorous research, drawn from diverse sources, that earned Handlin a reputation as one of the foremost commentators on American history and politics.
“In the years after World War II and for decades, he was one the major figures in the study of history,” said History Professor Emeritus Bernard Bailyn, a former student and colleague of Handlin’s, who has himself garnered two Pulitzer Prizes. “His views were intensely original and provocative, so people read them and listened.”
Handlin was a member of the Harvard faculty from 1939 until his retirement in 1984, serving the University in a wide array of roles, including Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor, director of the University Library from 1979 to 1984, and acting director of Harvard University Press in 1972.
As director of the Harvard libraries, Handlin began the modernization of the library catalogue and laid the groundwork for today’s electronic card catalogue, the Hollis system.
Born Sept. 29, 1915 in Brooklyn, NY to Russian-Jewish immigrants, Handlin was a product of the world that he would come to chronicle so famously. At 15 he entered Brooklyn College, and after earning his degree in 1934 he began studies as a graduate student at Harvard.
Handlin earned a master’s degree in 1935 and after a fellowship in Europe, began a brief teaching stint at his alma mater in Brooklyn. Working as he taught, Handlin successfully defended his dissertation in 1940, earning a Ph.D. in history from Harvard. Under the direction of Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., Handlin’s dissertation “Boston’s Immigrants, 1790-1865” won the American Historical Association’s top prize for young scholars. Among his many accolades was the Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, which he was awarded in 1954.
Handlin went on to write over 30 books and numerous articles on a wide range of topics in American social history, but his most influential work remained the study of immigration and race.
“I think he had a genius for explaining complex questions in clear language,” Carl H. Pforzheimer University Professor and University Librarian Robert C. Darnton said. “He could cut to the heart of an issue and make it really understandable to the general public.”
Handlin’s sway as a public intellectual and commentator peaked in the 1960s when his public pronouncements and testimony before Congress helped win the repeal of the United States’ immigration quota policy. At the same time, his writing on race helped break the moral backbone of American racism, Darnton said.
Darnton remembered Handlin fondly personally, as well. He recalled a time when he was interviewing for a job at Harvard and Handlin could recollect the details of Darnton’s undergraduate thesis, which he did not advise, asking Darnton specific questions about the work.
“He was someone who had read everything and really thought about everything,” Darnton said. “He was encyclopedic.”
Handlin was just as influential in the classroom. His unique teaching style—a combination of straight analysis and student-led discussion—influenced generations of students. Notable academics Stephan Thernstrom, Samuel Bass Warner, and Robert Fogelson were among Handlin’s roughly 80 dissertation advisees.
“There’s no Handlin school of historical writing,” Thernstrom said. “Oscar stood out as someone who emphasized that this was your dissertation not his .... He wasn’t interested in disciples.”
According to Darnton, for students of poor or minority backgrounds, Handlin’s presence at Harvard as a representative of the Jewish immigrant community was just as significant as his work.
“Here was living proof that Harvard was open to talent, and it could make room for people who were different,” Darnton said.
Handlin was made a Carl M. Loeb University Professor Emeritus upon his retirement and continued to research and write in his Widener Library study until his death.
“He was quite a presence, ancient as he was. He showed up every day in a suit,” said Darnton.
In addition to his academic work, Handlin helped found and direct Harvard’s Center for the Study of the History of Liberty in America and the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History. He also served on the boards of the Fulbright Scholarships and Brandeis University and as a trustee for the New York Public Library.
Handlin’s first wife Mary Flug Handlin died in 1976. He is survived by his second wife of 34 years, Lillian Bombach Handlin, as well as his brother and three children. A memorial has yet to be scheduled.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard scientists have developed a biomaterial with less friction than Teflon, one of the smoothest materials ever developed.
The new material, called SLIPS—Slippery Liquid-Infused Porous Surfaces—likely will have applications ranging from fuel transportation to bacterial prevention to medical equipment.
Tak-Sing Wong, a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences who led the project, drew inspiration for the new material from a carnivorous plant that lures prey into its cupped leaves that are too slippery to escape from.
Wong’s new material, described in a study published in Nature last week, derives its frictionless features from the structural orientation of the carnivorous pitcher plant’s leaf surface.
“Our surface pretty much consists of two components: One is a rough and porous surface, and the second component is the liquid, which is infiltrated within this porous solid,” Wong said. “So this liquid is actually a little bit above the porous solid.”
The surface layer of liquid embedded in new material is so smooth that it repels many other substances, including oil.
This repelling property will make SLIPS a prime candidate for coating the insides of oil pipelines, which will greatly reduce pipe resistance and make energy transport more efficient, according to Wong.
There are numerous other possible applications for SLIPS, including preventing the formation of ice in refrigerator coils and repelling blood on medical tubing.
Wong compared the repellent process of SLIPS to hydroplaning.
“After raining, the road has a very thin layer of water on top of it. And under the tire now you see a very thin layer of water, which starts to loosen the gripping, or loses the friction, such that the car will start hydroplaning on the surface,” he said.
In addition, SLIPS are extremely durable due to their self-healing nature.
Wong said that when an object impacts a liquid, an indent is made on the liquid surface. But once the object is removed, the fluid nature of the water allows it to refill the space that was occupied, in effect “self-healing.” Because SLIPS are coated in liquid, they react similarly.
“The versatility of SLIPS, their robustness and unique ability to self-heal makes it possible to design these surfaces for use almost anywhere, even under extreme temperature and pressure conditions,” said materials science professor Joanna Aizenberg, who oversaw the project. “It potentially opens up applications in harsh environments, such as polar or deep sea exploration, where no satisfactory solutions exist at present.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professor David W. Keith is working furiously to beat the winter weather. His company, Carbon Engineering, is designing a device to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by air capture, and the prototype wasn’t built to withstand the winter cold.
The team is currently testing a device called a contactor, a central element to the machine that collects carbon dioxide, at the University of Calgary.
Keith, a professor of applied physics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences as well as a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School, said work has fallen behind schedule. But the group remains optimistic about its innovation’s potential to manage carbon buildup in the atmosphere.
Carbon Engineering’s goal is to have a commercially viable technology by 2016. A typical plant would capture one million tons of carbon dioxide per year—the equivalent of taking about 300,000 cars off the road, according to the company’s website.
Keith’s machine involves capturing air and holding it inside the contactor, where a chemical solution absorbs carbon dioxide. The machine then creates pure carbon dioxide, which can then be put to productive use.
Carbon Engineering is not the first to build a machine to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but Keith’s group is working on a larger scale, he said. Keith—who was named a Hero of the Environment by Time Magazine in 2009—also said that his group was focused from the beginning on the economic viability of its technology.
“There were commercial air-capture devices in the 1950s and 1960s so the basic feasibility of doing this commercially was already established,” Keith said. “We are different because we are trying to think of how to do this in a way that is really cheap.”
Keith said that despite growth in the industry, many are still skeptical of the technology.
“There is a great deal of resistance to the idea that it could be useful to do this,” Keith said. “One of the biggest challenges for Carbon Engineering is getting over this hump. We do believe that there is something real here and we have lots of engineering to show it.”
The ideas behind Carbon Engineering can be traced back to Keith’s work at Carnegie Mellon.
His initial academic analysis eventually led to practical research in the field, he said. When Keith moved to the University of Calgary—where he serves as an adjunct professor—he found the group of individuals who would eventual compose the founding members of Carbon Engineering. Keith created the company in 2009 with funding from prominent individuals, including Bill Gates.
Keith said he is now eager to complete testing and proceed with building the world’s first air capture plant.
“I think it is really important to get this thing out in the real world because only when you do that can you really get a sense of what it will cost and how useful it will be,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Harvard’s first home game of the Ivy League season at Jordan Field on Saturday, the Crimson (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) got off to a hot start in the second half to bury Penn (1-6, 1-1) and pick up its first Ivy League win of the season.
While Harvard seemed to be in control for the majority of the first half, the Crimson only scored once in the first frame on a goal from freshman Noel Painter.
But co-captain Carly Dickson and sophomores Mariah Pewarski and Bridget McGillivray all scored within the first five minutes of the second half to put Harvard up, 4-0—a deficit that the Quakers could not overcome.
“Our start of the second half was excellent,” Dickson said. “It was the best start of any half we’ve had so far. That’s going to be the standard that we set from now on.”
The Crimson is back in action on Sunday afternoon at 2 p.m., when the team faces Bryant to close out the pair of weekend games at home.

Despite consistent play all night, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-4, 0-1 Ivy) fell to Dartmouth (9-3, 1-0) Saturday night in the opening Ivy League match for both teams.
The contest came down to a decisive fifth set after the Crimson and the Big Green traded wins in the first four games. Harvard came into the match coming off of a loss against Northeastern in the Harvard Invitational last weekend, while Dartmouth was riding a four-game winning streak.
The Big Green took the victory, 25-22, 23-25, 26-25, 15-25, and 15-10, bookending the tight match with a pair of set victories.
“Coming into [the match], we were pumped—it was the Ivy League opener,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We’re matched up really well against Dartmouth, and I think we prepared well for the [the match].”
Despite the Crimson’s careful preparation, unable to overcome an early Dartmouth advantage, it dropped the first set. A kill from junior Taylor Docter brought the Harvard within one late in the game, but three kills from the Big Green’s front line sealed the first win of the match.
The Crimson changed its fortunate in the second set, and was able to rebuild some of the momentum it had lost in the first, with three consecutive kills in the first five points of the game.
A block by sophomores Erin Cooney and Teresa Skelly put Harvard up 24-22, and a service error from the Big Green evened the playing field between the two teams, now tied at 1-1.
The two traded the next two sets, with Dartmouth taking the third and Harvard coming back to force the match into a fifth-game decision.
Even with its decisive 25-15 fourth-set victory, two consecutive service errors put the Crimson in a hole that it could not escape, falling to the Big Green, 15-10.
“The game was a nail-biter, and we definitely fought back, but it just wasn’t enough,” Wu said. “Dartmouth is a great team that hit with no fear and we were hesitant…We weren’t going out with our guns firing, trying to earn our won points.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The artistic folk aren’t normally the kind to make a big splash at a football game.
But at Friday night’s football game, a pair of on-field performances caught the attention of the 18,565 in attendance.
Entertainment during pauses in games has been around almost as long as the sports themselves. Still, the Harvard Crimson Dance Team may have taken its mandate to entertain a little too far. The troupe came on at the end of the first quarter, but as the Crimson and Brown made their way back onto the field, the dancers didn’t move.
And for a solid 30 seconds, the dancers and the football players shared the gridiron, much to the confusion of the fans and apparent bewilderment of the referees.
The stranger performance of the night came from Brown’s band at halftime. It started just like any other band performance—unfamiliar fight songs, two-year-old cultural references—when it took a rather peculiar turn.
They arranged themselves like, well, what looked like a male sex organ that spanned most of the length of the field. I’m not sure if they meant to give Harvard the shaft.
So, without further ado, readers can choose their cheap one-liner about the picture from the following options:
1.	It definitely looked smaller than when they practiced.  Must’ve been cold.
2.	25-second routine?  That’s about right.
3.	Insert your own joke based on the fact that the name of the school is, hilariously, Brown.
It was an exciting game, and it was much tighter throughout the contest than the final score indicates. But there really is nothing quite like a little fifth-grade humor to make a rainy football Friday game that much better.

Every year, the Phillip Brooks House Association holds a plant sale outside of Mower through the month of September. Alongside this annual sale, there are a number of florist shops in the area selling plants and flowers year round. With these options at hand, students seeking to add a bit of green, leafy life to their dorms need not look any farther than the Square.
The benefits of keeping a plant in your dorm are varied—they range anywhere from combating the Cambridge pollution to, more realistically, providing that general be-good feeling of having another form of life in your dorm besides a sleeping roommate.
Whether or not the effects on health are actually substantial or just a placebo effect, it can't be denied that plants are a good potential dorm decoration.
Finding a plant that is both hardy and aesthetically pleasing is no challenge. Leafy, non-flowering plants are ideal for most, as they tend to be more durable than plants with blossoms.
According to the Brattle Street Florists and Petali Flowers, two local florist shops, the golden pothos, spider plant, bamboo and fern are all great for people with typical Harvard schedules. They require watering once a week and can grow in low light. As the hardiest of plants, cacti require special mention. As native to barren deserts, they are certainly capable of surviving in a dorm room, providing that you water them every two or three weeks.
For people who want a bit more color besides green in their rooms, there are a few flowering plants that were recommended for dorm life as well. They do require more maintenance than leafy plants, as flowers tend to be fragile, but with regular care these flowers should last you a long time. African violets, orchids, hydrangeas, and jade plants all add a bit of vibrant color to an otherwise lonely windowsill or desk. Provided that you water them once a week and keep them in direct sunlight, they will not quickly wither away.
With all of these options, it may not be a bad idea to add a plant or two to your dorm before winter hits and leaves start to fall.
