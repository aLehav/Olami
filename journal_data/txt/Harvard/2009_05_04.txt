If you were within half a mile of the Lampoon building Saturday night, you might have noticed something a little different.
But apparently, not everyone found the festivities quite so awe-inspiring as the Lampoon alums, who could be seen strolling around the castle in tuxes and dresses.
Pissed off Adams residents took to their House list Saturday to voice annoyance at the extravagant commotion in the tellingly titled e-mail chain "Drumming." Wrote one resident:
almost as cool as the finals club across from boloco that blasts music out of their windows whenever the sun is out.  real cool guys, i wish i could sit on a balcony and look as cool as you.  if only, if only.
But we at FlyBy feel compelled to give credit where credit is due. The Lampoon did a pretty sick job with what could only have been dreamed up during an acid trip of some sort. Bravo, good sirs. Now, if only you would publish more than five times a year....

FlyBy went to visit the Dalai Lama’s tree today to try to soak in some holiness, to center ourselves, if you will, before finals. FlyBy sat with the tree. FlyBy ate lunch with the tree. FlyBy even tried hugging the tree (don’t laugh. This is a serious post. We are talking about the Dalai Lama’s tree). Nothing.
Though FlyBy felt no significant spiritual uplifting, the birch tree, located directly behind Thayer and across from Memorial Hall, is itself is soaked in symbolism. According to the Gazette, the tree is a hybrid specially grown by the staff of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, a mix of North American and Tibetan birches. The tree symbolizes a harmonious mix of Eastern and Western culture.
“I think he [the Dalai Lama] very much appreciated the symbolism of the tree,” Dean of the Graduate School of Education Kathleen McCartney told FlyBy.
But even the Dalai Lama has a sense of humor.
“He put the first shovel load and he teased President Faust that she didn’t have enough dirt when she went next, so Dean Graham and I both made sure we had a full load,” McCartney said.

Apparently, it's Star Wars Day (get it! May the 4th, may the force). Actually, it's just one of two (or more) recognized Star Wars days. Because, hey, at FlyBy, we're okay with recognizing our or other peoples' supreme dorkiness.
Celebrate by watching Episodes IV through VI (let's be real, I-III were just bad, sorry Natalie). Or, set up a Jedi church. Or learn things that may well have had nothing to do with any of the movies or George Lucas.
Anything to procrastinate studying for finals. Although, come on. You shouldn't be doing that yet.
