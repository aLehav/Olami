After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
November 11, 8 p.m., November 12, 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.
New College Theater (Farkas Hall)
Directed by Hazel A. Lever ’13
Produced by Andrea I. Moreno ‘12 and Talia M. Fox ’13
The Harvard Ballet Company (HBC) offers a fresh take on ballet in its upcoming performance “Out of Body.” This student-run production contrasts minimal costume and set design with an abundance of varied styles that range from classical ballet to contemporary pointe to modern. The show, featuring eleven routines, aspires to present dance in its many forms through its numerous pieces, mirroring the diversity found both in the Harvard dance community and the dance world as a whole.
The majority of the show’s choreography is crafted by the dancers themselves. Although it also uses some professional choreography to create an eclectic mix of dance styles set to an equally diverse soundtrack. The dancers perform to jazz, swing, and classical music, and even to Itzhak Perlman’s score from the film “Schindler’s List.” Three routines feature guest choreography by Victor Plotnikov, the principal dancer for the Boston Ballet and choreographer for Providence Ballet; Darcy Naganuma, professional modern choreographer of Naganuma Dance; and HBC alumna Nina Stoller-Lindsey ’10, who has choreographed pieces for LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts.
“Seeing the whole show come together is really rewarding,” says producer Talia M. Fox ’13. The show prides itself on drawing from a wide array of inspirations, especially from the HBC members who have created the dance routines. According to producer Andrea I. Moreno ’12, “dancers come from very diverse backgrounds, so everyone brings their own personality into the routines.”
The show also hopes to stray from the traditional classical framework with which the audience usually associates ballet. “People come to our show expecting classical ballet, and they get some classical ballet, but we have something for everyone,” says Fox. “Out of Body” aims to create a meaningful amalgamation that first and foremost can be accessible to a wide audience. As director Hazel A. Lever ’13 notes, “we’re very aware of our audience, and that’s kind of the fun part of the show.” The performance is both surprising and unique, “because it’s so diverse, [and] you get to kind of pull the whole show around the different performances.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, The Crimson ran a piece that described in great detail the academic experiences of students taking six classes. This semester, out of over 6,400 undergraduates, there are only 20 such students. They have a variety of motivations: Some are propelled by the desire to explore specific academic questions, others by the prospect of exploring different concentrations, and others by the need to achieve more breadth in academic study.
It seems innocuous enough—less than one percent of the student body making the personal choice to take on extra work. But the article, viewed around 3,600 times online, has received a vitriolic response from some students. “Taking 6 classes does not make you a better human being,” wrote one online commentator. “Articles like this remind me why I hate being at Harvard.” This sentiment was echoed across campus, whether as a reaction to the article’s apparent glorification of students who take on extraordinary workloads or to the very presence of these students at all.
Such a response is unwarranted. So what if some students want to take six classes? So what if they perform very well in them? As illustrated in the article, many of the so-called “six-class elite” seem to take more courses because they are intellectually curious, not because they wish to compete with their fellow students.
Of course, the response to the article reflects the reality that Harvard students have the potential to be insecure and competitive about classroom results and choices. Talking about GPAs at the dinner table is about as great a social taboo in this community as is expressing a hatred of small children, and talking about academic accomplishments—even to an inquisitive reporter—is automatically interpreted as bragging.
However, we should not be unable to appreciate (much less unwilling even to hear about) our classmates’ accomplishments. Success is not a zero-sum game, and, when our peers manage extreme course loads, it does not reflect poorly on anyone else. If anything, it should make us further aware of what an extraordinary community we are in and grateful to be at a school in the company of such talented peers.
In the end, everyone finds their own balance of class, extracurricular activities, and fun. There is no one “right” course load. As one interviewed student, Sam J. Bakkila ’11-’12, said: “I feel that no one should take six [classes] just to prove that they can, and no one taking four classes or less should feel any pressure to take more than four.”
It’s easy to be oversensitive about classes around midterm time, but we shouldn’t respond by insulting the good-faith academic efforts of our peers.

Like many of those interviewed in Victoria A. Baena’s excellent Fifteen Minutes piece on students’ disappointment with the Obama administration, I remember Election Day, 2008 as one of unusual euphoria. I was at the College Democrats’ party in Currier when I heard that Ohio had been called for Obama, clinching the election, and promptly started celebrating like I’d never celebrated before.
I tried unsuccessfully to remember my mother’s cell phone number and ended up screaming “WE ELECTED OBAMA” to some poor Maine woman. I ran to Winthrop to meet up with old intern friends from Obama’s primary campaign, amazed that we had even gotten to the general election, let alone won it. I may have had a little bit to drink. It was a good time.
So I understand, in light of the still-stagnant economy and the deficit brinkmanship of the last year, why people are disappointed. Obama’s victory was emotionally meaningful, and, given the huge expectations that win set, discontent is inevitable. But the right takeaway, I think, is not that Obama is a failure, but that that major change is really hard, especially in America, especially for the president, and especially now.
Suppose that the United States had a parliamentary system of the kind in place in most of the developed world. Let’s suppose that the U.S. had no president or Senate, that the speaker of the House operated as a de facto prime minister, and that Obama had been swept into that office. Given that the House, under Speaker Nancy Pelosi, passed cap-and-trade legislation to fight global warming and a health care bill with a public option, it’s fair to say that Speaker Obama would have gotten that done as well.
He also likely could have passed initiatives that Pelosi didn’t take up, because she assumed the Senate would just kill them. Perhaps he would have passed more stimulus spending, perhaps campaign finance reform. He would have done what all parliamentary leaders with majorities do: Use the power voters gave him to pass his whole agenda.
But instead of a parliament, the U.S. has a system that is designed to prevent government policy from fully reflecting the public will. The Founding Fathers, as we all learned in high school civics, were deathly afraid of actual democracy, and put plenty of veto points (the president, the Senate, the Supreme Court, etc.) in the Constitution so as to prevent it. That Obama could not have pushed through his whole agenda, like leaders of other developed democracies can, is not his fault. It’s James Madison’s.
Some might find this explanation unsatisfying. Didn’t Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, and Lyndon B. Johnson pass major legislation under these same constraints? Yes, but they had two other things going for them. For one thing, their Congressional majorities were enormous compared to Obama’s. In 1935, when Roosevelt signed Social Security into law, there were 72 Democrats in the Senate. In 1965, when Johnson signed the bill creating Medicare, there were 68 Senate Democrats. Obama, by contrast, had at most 60 Senate Democrats to work with, and only 59 by the time health care reform passed.
What’s more, Obama has had to deal with a de facto 60-vote supermajority requirement that only emerged in the past few years. Roosevelt and Johnson had to deal with a higher bar for breaking filibusters (67 votes instead of 60), but it was only with Mitch McConnell’s emergence as Senate Minority Leader in 2007 that the procedure began to be used routinely to routinely legislation, and before 1970 it was only really used to delay civil rights legislation. Indeed, when Johnson was whipping votes for Medicare, his legislative strategists did not even consider the possibility that the bill would be filibustered. It was just too absurd an idea.
If you’re going to be disappointed with someone, then, be disappointed with the Republicans and moderate Democrats in Congress who derailed Obama’s agenda. Talia B. Lavin ’12, one of those disappointed students quoted in Baena’s article, regrets that Obama has not done more to curtail “continual expansion of the power of the presidency.”
But on domestic policy, the rise of the filibuster has actually lead to an expansion of Congress’ power and diminishing of the president’s. And with great power, as Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben reminds us, comes great responsibility. Mitch McConnell may not be “one of us,” but he is a person with moral agency. Liberals should start treating him like one. We can argue for days over what Obama could have done differently, but there’s no question that there was plenty that Congress could have done differently. To respond to the policy failures McConnell and his allies creates by blaming Obama is to enable Republicans’, and Congress’s, effort to duck responsibility for their actions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Occupy movements have received heavy criticism from both the right and left for their lack of coherence, leadership, and goals. At Harvard, criticisms of the Occupy movements are exceptionally strong among students. Crimson staff editorials and featured opinion pieces on the Occupy movements have mostly represented critical views that characterize the movement as “disjointed,” “misguided,” and “ignorant.”
These criticisms exemplify a distinct lack of imagination, based on a narrow interpretation of social movements that strictly privileges telos, or outcomes. The insistent need to constrictanalyses of the global Occupy movements within a value-system rooted in efficacy and outcomes has completely missed the point.
In their narrow focus on telos, these criticisms have glaringly neglected the physical act and process of occupying spaces in cities across the United States and the world. Lisa Duggan, a professor of social and cultural analysis, has observed how the American public has shrunk in the last 40 years. In her book, “The Twilight of Equality?”, Duggan notes how the last few decades have seen the rise of neoliberalism, a term that describes a processcharacterized by the transfer of decision-making and wealth distribution processes from the public to individual corporations. This has resulted in a “shrinking public,” in which state spending on social services is drastically slashed while spaces for democratic debate and cultural expression continue todiminish.
Against this backdrop, the Occupy movements challenge the trend of the “shrinking public” by physically reclaiming and rejuvenating public and private parks. 
Even if efficacy is not the privileged category of analysis, the Occupy movements do certainly have very significant and tangible effects. Even by teleological standards, their bodily participation in a social movement has considerably opened up a public for Americans to debate issues of income inequality and democratic participation. The Occupy movements have thus activated a public sphere for having crucially important discussions.
One could argue that thesurge of mass support for Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008 was a form of a rejuvenated public sphere. While this is true, the participation of Americans in Obama’s presidential campaignremained conservative in the sense that it is restricted to an electoral process under the influence of money politics and corporate interests.The Occupy movements, however, are instead imagining a more ambitious alternative that will significantly and thoroughly change how politics is done through their direct participation in the public.
By making their claims legible, their presence visible, and their frustrations threateningly palpable, the protestors are sending a strong message that there needs to be discussions around social inequality, that there should be more public participation in those debates, and that the current system needs to change.
While it is unclear what this change may look like, there is really no rush to gain clarity. In fact, the Occupy movements have impressively been able to restrain from sacrificing critical thought and reflection to the political injunction to act. They have instead provided a space for new collaborative possibilities and for finding and forming different allies in the process of building the 99 percent. In the meantime, reports and findings are being released that continue to highlight rising income inequality in the United States, the disproportionately generous bailouts of large corporations by federal governments, and the close ties that exist between these governments and hugely profiteering corporations. All of these—the Occupy movements argue—are at the expense of the majority of taxpayers who have had to confront rising costs of living and unemployment.
Much of the reporting on the Occupy movements, like most of its criticisms, has uncritically measured the value of the movements by their efficacy and outcomes. Many of the news reports and opinion pieces, including The Crimson’s, have used language that imply this value bias. This is not to say that protestors in the Occupy movements are not critical. Since the beginning of the Occupy Wall Street protests, movements in different places have critically questioned and reflected on their representation and inclusion of people of color, women, unions, students, the homeless, and indigenous groups. Certainly, there are many ways in which the Occupy movements could be improved, and indeed protestors and supporters have treated these challenges with an impressive amount of self-reflection and consensus building.
The mainstream media, as a result of its teleological focus, has rarely covered these complex and conscientious discussions of difficult but important matters. Additionally, criticisms of the movement by Harvard students have rigidly confined their analyses within strict binaries of right and left, conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, effective and ineffective. In these, there exists a distinct lack of imagination that would allow for a more productive examination of the movements. Such an examination must recognize the movements’ unique contingencies and their setting of new trends and precedents within this historical era.
The Occupy movements are unprecedented in that they rely on a host of new technologies, diverse demographics, and several strategies of protest. The fact that the movements were able to ignite conversations across the globe about the need to confront gaping income inequalities and a global financial system that is mostly favorable to the rich says something about the Occupy movements. What that something is remains to be seen.
I am concerned that student voices most represented at Harvard have been too quick to dismiss the Occupy movements. These evaluations have thus far mostly foreclosed imagination and eschewed nondualistic thinking. In spite of the fact that some of us at Harvard may have our minds already made up about the Occupy movements, I hope that others will continue to imagine possibilities for social change, even despite the odds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We find ourselves becoming ever more disappointed with the nature of our campus discussion about Occupy. Too many of us, in lecture halls and dining halls, on Facebook and in The Crimson, have increasingly been expressing derision and hostility towards the movement.
Many of us have values and experiences in common with the spirit of Occupy. We know about the economic challenges of the middle class, the working class, and the very poor. We are aware of unequal access to quality education, healthcare, housing, and food, and we believe these are serious problems for the country.
In spite of these shared concerns, there is a growing group among us choosing to disparage Occupy. Instead of respecting the efforts of those camped out in cities across the country, they condemn the movement as disorganized. They complain that there are too many messages and too few concrete goals. When Occupiers do propose concrete ideas and goals, these students dismiss the proposals as shortsighted, off-point, or extreme. Many take issue with Occupy’s lack of leadership and clear communication. When the demonstrators do communicate, there are Harvard students who label the rhetoric as overdramatic or anti-intellectual.
We tell ourselves that if the right leader came along, we would get involved. If it were just the right message, in just the right tone, then we would hold up a sign and join the march. If there were a beautifully packaged eight-point plan, then the demonstrators would deserve our support.
Real democracy isn’t like that. It’s messy and complicated and hard, and people bring to the table what they have to give. Real democracy means everyone has the chance to stand up and speak out. If we’re upset about half-baked goals and unsatisfactory rhetoric, then we should come up with our own. We should help the Occupiers research and write and dream up bigger and better things for this country. It’s not enough to say a policy isn’t supported by evidence, if we can’t supply one that is better-researched. It’s not enough to say a goal is impractical if we can’t suggest a more realistic one.
In a true and fair democracy like the one Occupy is trying to foster, decisions are made by those who show up. If you’re not showing up, then it’s not fair to make unproductive and contemptuous criticisms of those who are working to build a better society. Constructive criticism is essential to a healthy democracy. The purpose of constructive criticism is not to tear down another person’s work but to support it and improve it.
We need a fundamental change in the conversation about Occupy and in the broader conversation about the state of the country. Let’s talk about the kind of country and the kind of world we want to live in. Let’s talk about how to take better care of each other. Let’s talk about how to be responsible neighbors and dependable friends. Let’s talk about how to be inclusive and respectful.
We need to stop asking more from those who are already doing their best, and start expecting more from ourselves. If we agree that no one should be hungry and no one should be cold, that every child should have access to education and every sick person should have access to medicine, why are we content to sit on the sidelines while others work toward systematic solutions toinjustice?
These goals speak to the most important problems facing our society, yettheyare not all that we should be striving for. Our neighbors and friends should not have merely enough to survive. Our society has the means to ensure that its citizens live rewarding and fulfilling lives. Achieving such an end will require much of us. If Occupy has taught us nothing else, it is that our society suffers from too little civic participation and too little active citizenship. Far too few of us vote. But even voting is not enough to ensure a just and vibrant society. That requires time and effort from us. We can march. We can write. We can even simply discuss with our friends.
So let’s have a different conversation. Let’s talk about empathy and justice, compassion and love. Let’s talk about how it isn’t fair when someone doesn’t have a place to live and doesn’t have enough to eat. Let’s talk about what matters, and then let’s do something about it.

Lack of stimulation in Romanian orphanages stunts brain development in children, Harvard Medical School Professor of Pediatrics Charles A. Nelson said at a Harvard China Care event Tuesday evening.
At the request of the Romanian government, Nelson studied the influence of childhood experience and early psycho-social deprivation on the brain in Romanian orphanages.
“Romania had a particularly egregious history,” Nelson said.
Communist policies have left an overwhelming population of abandoned children to state institutions.
Children in overcrowded orphanages often struggle with a stifling, highly-regimented daily routine, Nelson said.
These environments often cause social interaction and attachment problems, autism, and stunted growth.
Without stimulating experience, children develop “brain deprivation” as a result of social neglect.
Nelson’s study found that children suffering from brain deprivation appear physically stunted. The body appears to save essential growth hormones for brain development, he said.
Children in orphanages generally have smaller brains than other children. They also consistently display radically lower IQs than average children. Nelson hypothesized that fewer brain cells might account for lowered brain activity.
Research also showed that children who were moved to foster homes before the age of two were more likely to recover from the detrimental effects of living in an orphanage. But children moved to a foster home after the age of two showed little amelioration.
These results suggest that the impact of an environment on development varies over time, Nelson said. A child’s development occurs during “sensitive” or “critical” periods of growth.
According to the study, girls do not suffer in institutions as much as boys. Girls also benefit more when they are placed in foster home.
Romanian officials originally hoped that scientific evidence would influence the government to change orphanage policies, but Nelson said he is hesitant to promote policy changes.
“We can’t just waltz into the country and think that we know best,” Nelson said.
Although the location of Nelson’s research differs from China Care’s traditional focus in Asia, event organizers said his work is still relevant.
“His research is incredibly applicable to China Care’s work,” said Rena Mei ’13, China Care Medical Committee co-coordinator and co-coordinator of the event.
“I hope people not only learn more about the medical conditions in orphanages, but they’ll also be motivated to do something about it,” she added.

Norman F. Ramsey, a Nobel Prize winner in physics and a former Harvard professor, died last Friday at age 96.
Ramsey, who taught at Harvard for forty years, is famous for his development of the “Ramsey Method” and a hydrogen maser used in atomic clocks.
“It is not overstating to say Norman was one of the greatest scientists of the twentieth century,” said physics professor Gerald Gabrielse, who replaced Ramsey in the physics department when he retired in 1987.
Ramsey began teaching at Harvard in 1947 and worked with over 85 graduate students during his tenure.
Ramsey prioritized his work with students and was very involved in guiding their research, said MIT professor Daniel Kleppner, one of his former students. “Harvard was his life from 1947 to the end,” Kleppner said.
Physics professor and Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 recalls that Ramsey often attended events in Leverett House when he was in town.
“Each year, after the Nobel Prize in physics was announced, he would gather with [students in] the Senior Common Room and explain what the prize was about,” Georgi wrote in an email. “In 1989, he had to cancel—because he had received the Nobel Prize himself.”
Ramsey’s wife Ellie said that her husband’s research “was broad and deep and would literally take two days to fully describe.”
Ramsey shared the Nobel Prize for developing the separated oscillatory field method that allowed for frequency in an atomic system to be measured more accurately. As a result, scientists are able to measure time and unstable nuclei precisely.
According to Gabrielse, this technique—now referred as the “Ramsey Method”—is frequently used in the field and discussed at physics conferences.
Ramsey was also recognized for developing a hydrogen maser with Kleppner, which allows for precise time measurement now used in GPS devices.
Kleppner said that when he and Ramsey were working on their research, no one in the physics community foresaw the potential applications of the hydrogen maser.
In addition, Ramsey was one of the first to study electric dipole moments in particles and to examine asymmetry within a neutron. According to Gabrielse, Ramsey pioneered this field, but researchers at Harvard continue to study these properties in Ramsey’s absence.
Ramsey received a number of awards for his work, including the National Medal of Science Award, and later served on the presidential committee that selects recipients of the award. According to Ellie, Ramsey was especially pleased when he received an honorary degree from Harvard in 2006.

Hong Kong political leader Donald Tsang enumerated the virtues of the city state’s autonomy in relation to mainland China in a speech he called “A Tale of Two Systems,” delivered last night at the Kennedy School.
As chief executive and president of the Executive Council of the Government of Hong Kong, Tsang has been involved in establishing the current relationship between Hong Kong and China.
This relationship relies on both a separation and coordination between the two states—it is a system that situates these countries as distinct, yet symbiotic, Tsang said.
“It allowed the city to return to China while retaining its own sense of individuality,” Tsang said. “It allowed the different way of life in Hong Kong to be preserved and flourish.”
In July of 1997, control of Hong Kong was handed over from the British to the People’s Republic of China. But due to what is now known as the “mini-constitution,” or Basic Law of Hong Kong, the region has independence from mainland China in terms of most of its financial, legal, political, and social decisions.
Tsang asserted the importance of the China-Hong Kong collaboration, citing that the spread of money, people, and ideas as helping to further the economic and social progress in these states. In fact, bilateral trade between mainland China and Hong Kong has close to tripled since the autonomy of the latter was established.
Hong Kong’s independence is also leading to a revival of cultural heritage and interests, Tsang said. As he put it, his government is trying to enact education reform as well as promote the “touch and inspiration of art.”
Along with the restoration of sovereign identity, he said billions of dollars are being funneled into building roads and railways to the mainland, further connecting the states to one another.
This process is integral for what Tsang sees as the duty of his citizens in aiding the future of their home. He concluded his talk by calling upon the people of Hong Kong to heed his words.
“I have the conviction in the responsibility of every man and woman in every circumstance ... to try to live peacefully with our neighbors,” Tsang said. “That is the backbone upon which our prospects depend. History has not ended. Each generation has the possibility to write new chapters. Keep writing.”

As custodians enter their final week of bargaining over their union’s contract with Harvard, union leaders say there are a number of issues—including health care, benefits, and workload—on which the University and workers have not yet reached an agreement.
In the run-up to the contract deadline, workers and union members have ramped up their efforts to draw attention and support for their campaign.
Union representatives and workers submitted a petition signed by over 400 Harvard custodians to University president Drew G. Faust earlier this month and organized two rallies in front of the Holyoke Building last Friday.
Union leaders and workers said that they are unwilling to concede current health care benefits or accept workload increases.
“Health care is something we can’t just back down on,” said Nancy B. Kohn, a spokesperson for SEIU Local 615, the union which represents Harvard custodial workers. “Harvard can’t expect the same already hardworking workers to do more—it’s just not fair,” she added.
The University defended it’s current health care plan.
"The University already pays more to cover their healthcare benefits than many other institutions,” wrote University spokesperson Kevin Galvin in an email statement. “The University also grants eligibility for healthcare coverage to custodians who work as few as 16 hours per week.”
Rudy Samayoa, a Harvard janitor and member of the negotiation committee, told ralliers on Friday that they needed to remain strong in the face of resistance from the University on workload issues.
“Harvard says we are not being overworked and that in fact they believe we can do more. We have told them this isn’t true and that we are being overworked due to layoffs that create a smaller crew to cover the same amount of work,” Samayoa said. “We have to keep on taking action and show that we demand Harvard respect our hard work.”
Kohn also discussed the importance of benefits parity between workers who are direct employees of Harvard and workers who are hired by contractors, saying that “all workers deserve fair pay and benefits.”
The custodians hired directly by the University are advocating on behalf of workers employed by private contractors such as the Facilities Maintenance Operations. The current contract for custodians employed by Harvard expires November 15th.
In particular, the union is pushing the University to provide access to the Tuition Assistance Program and childcare for contract workers.
Currently, contract workers enjoy the same “core benefits” as direct Harvard employees—including basic health care, wages, and paid time-off—under the Wage and Benefit Parity Policy, instituted by the University in 2002. The University also provides all custodians with access to the University’s Bridge to Learning program and its Literacy Program.

When the Chinatown Cultural Center opens a long-awaited public library in November, an advocacy program launched by six Harvard undergraduates plans to provide programming focused on storytelling, mentoring, and computer literacy.
Boston’s Chinatown neighborhood has been advocating for a library for over fifty years, and the Center—a small, privately-funded library and cultural center in Chinatown—will open in the bottom of an apartment complex within the next month.
“Even without municipal funding, there’s no reason why Chinatown shouldn’t have a library,” said Nancy Y. Xie ’13, the coordinator of the Harvard Chinatown Advocacy for Learning and Literacy. HCALL’s other members include C.C. Gong ’15, Esther W. Lee ’13, Jenny Ye ’13, Katrina T. Wong ’14, and Paige Qin ’13.
Xie said that she was attracted to the Center’s mission because of her own roots.
“A lot of this really starts from a story of self,” Xie said. “My family was a first-generation immigrant family. That gave me an added motive.”
Gong said that the community’s efforts in pushing for the Center illustrated its importance in their eyes.
“What attracted me was the fact that this entire project was created because a community came together and made this possible,” Gong said. “That just shows the need. They took matters into their own hands.”
The 700-square-foot Center is housed in the first floor of the Oak Terrace apartment complex in Chinatown. Xie explained that the Center is a culmination of a five-decade-long effort to bring a library to Chinatown, the only neighborhood in Boston without one.
“Chinatown is the only neighborhood that has not had a library in 50 years,” Xie said. “That brings up the question, ‘Why?’ There’s definitely a need.”
Xie said that about 60 years ago, there was a Boston Public Library branch in Chinatown, but it was torn down to make room for a highway. Afterwards, the library sent book trucks into the neighborhood, but that program was also discontinued. In 2001, the Chinatown Coalition began advocating for a new branch, and their proposal reached the Boston City Council but was rejected in 2008 when the recession hit.
In 2009, the Coalition opened a “storefront” library, which operated until the beginning of 2010. The Chinatown Coalition and the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center have since found a temporary space to house a collection of 7,000 books, Xie said.
HCALL plans to organize three programs at the Center: storytelling, peer-to-peer mentoring, and computer literacy.
The group will invite Harvard students to tell stories, make presentations, or put on performances at the Center.
“It’ll be a fun way to get more people involved and spark the community interest,” Xie said.
The mentoring program will pair Harvard students and, eventually, students from other colleges, with mainly immigrant high school students to help students prepare to apply for college.
The organization has already begun actively recruiting on campus, and Xie is looking forward to seeing the work continue after she graduates.
“This is only going to get bigger,” Xie said. “I’m a junior. It would be great to see people continuously involved.”

Students and faculty members will protest the University’s investment policies and perceived biases in its economics courses at an “Occupy Harvard” rally in Harvard Yard Wednesday night.
Organizers said they hope the event will draw attention to what they believe was Harvard’s role in the economic crisis while showing solidarity with the national Occupy movement.
“Harvard as an institution has been inextricably involved in a lot of the systems of corporate corruption and greed,” said Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, an event organizer who is also a member of the Crimson editorial board.
In the past, Harvard’s endowment has supported questionable policies, Gabriel H. Bayard ’15 said.
“Harvard has a long way to go to become a university for the 99 percent,” he added.
Harvard’s classrooms also played a role in the financial crisis, said Benjamin L. Beachy, a student at the Kennedy School and a rally organizer.
“Economic lectures have a way of becoming economic policies in Washington,” he said. “Before the economic crisis, Harvard professors taught the inefficiency of financial regulation and the manifest rationality of investors.”
Protesters will also call for more transparency from the University administration, said Rossen L. Djagalov, a teaching assistant in History and Literature.
“The institution is powerful and affluent. We need people to make sure Harvard lives up to its promise,” he said. “The students involved in the Occupy Harvard movement want Harvard to be the best institution it can be.”
Many see Harvard as a “stronghold for the 1 percent,” Beachy said. “Unfortunately, Harvard has not done enough to disprove that accusation,” he added.
The rally will feature speakers from the Harvard community, including professors from the College, the Law School, and the Business School.
Organizers will also encourage impromptu speeches from Harvard students and members of the labor unions on campus.
“[The event is] really for opening the conversation to the Harvard community,” said Fenna M. Krienen, a teaching fellow in Molecular and Cellular Biology and an event organizer. Krienen said the rally will address issues “that matter to us as students, and for this country as a whole.”

New research on inequality in education indicates that over the past 30 years, increased disparity in family income levels has resulted in unequal educational attainment for students.
These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that children in the United States have a better chance of attaining upward social mobility through education than students in other industrialized nations, according to Harvard Graduate School of Education Professor Richard J. Murnane and University of California, Irvine Professor Greg J. Duncan. The two professors edited “Whither Opportunity?: Rising Inequality, Schools and Children’s Life Chances,” a new book that explores the relationship between educational achievement and family financial status.
“If a child is growing up poor, chances that his children will not grow up poor is a great deal better if you live in one of these other countries,” said Murnane. Most Americans are not aware of this “striking and disturbing pattern,” he said.
The book includes 25 chapters by nearly 50 different economists, sociologists, and educational policy experts.
As the gap between the richest and poorest families in America has grown, an increasing number of families are unable to enroll their children in enrichment activities, which researchers identified as crucial to a student’s success in the classroom.
In addition, financial burdens increase the stress levels in low-income households, which negatively impacts a student’s educational outcomes.
“You can put together a story where at least some of increase in the gap in test chores and achievement is a function of what money can buy,” Duncan said.
According to Murnane, the increased segregation of residential areas by income has resulted in lower standards in teaching quality and higher rates of student turnover throughout the school year.
But Duncan said that there is evidence that the racial achievement gap has been reduced significantly during the same period, which is promising for closing the socioeconomic achievement gap in the future.
Murnane also discussed the importance of parental involvement in children’s education. “Parents are clearly important, but we haven’t made very much progress on defining interventions that really improve or alter parenting, or support low-income families better,” Murnane said.
Murnane and Duncan said that they are currently conducting research on pre-kindergarten programs in Boston and high school programs in New York that de-emphasize the role of parents.

Harvard researchers have demonstrated for the first time that cooked meat provides substantially more energy than raw meat, highlighting inaccuracies in current food labeling methods.
The research also reaffirms the crucial role that cooking played in the evolution of early humans.
According to the head researcher and graduate student Rachel N. Carmody, human adoption of cooking methods may explain evolutionary increases in body and brain size, as well as human inclination toward high-energy activities such as long distance running.
Cooked diets are also easier to digest and may account for the smaller size of teeth and guts in humans today.
“The astonishing thing here is that cooking is the signature feature of the human diet compared to other animals, and yet these are the first experiments that show that, when you cook meat, you get more energy out of it,” said human and evolutionary biology professor Richard W. Wrangham, who also served as a member of the research team.
A long-standing hypothesis attributed evolutionary developments to increasing quantities of meat in ancestral diets. But the team’s research supports a complementary hypothesis, proposed almost a decade ago by Wrangham, that cooking allowed ancestral humans to extract more energy from the foods that they were already eating.
The study, which was launched in 2006 and conducted at Harvard’s Biological Research Infrastructure, used mice to test the energetic effects on body mass of cooking and pounding meat and sweet potatoes.
The mice were administered four different treatments of either sweet potatoes or meat—raw and whole, raw and pounded, cooked and whole, and cooked and pounded.
The results indicate that the energetic effects of cooking were greater in both foods than those of pounding, and that cooking further improved the energetic value of already-pounded food.
Hungry mice also strongly preferred cooked food, suggesting that the energetic effects of the cooked diet were obvious to the subjects themselves.
The research also suggests that biochemical methods currently used to determine the calorie values reported on food labels misestimate the energy value of poorly processed foods.
“Whether you eat raw food or cooked food is a personal choice,” said Wrangham. “What we’re really drawing attention to is the fact that you will get fewer calories out of food that is raw than food that is cooked. It’s time that we recognize that in our nutritional labeling.”
The team’s findings, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may have implications for scientists studying malnutrition and obesity worldwide.
According to Wrangham, the team hopes to continue its research to better understand the genetic differences between humans and other primates.
“I think this research really gets to the heart of why humans are the way we are,” said Carmody.

At 6:29 p.m. Tuesday evening, students gathered atop the Science Center to watch an asteroid approximating the size of a city block narrowly miss a collision with planet Earth.
The passage of the asteroid some 201,700 miles from Earth marked the closest encounter since 1972.
Timothy Spahr, director of the Minor Planet Center at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, reassured students not to worry about the asteroid because the calculations predicting that the asteroid would miss Earth by a considerable distance were quite secure—a matter of “a bread and butter scientific calculation and cataloguing,” as he put it.
But because the asteroid, called “2005 YU55,” passed at such relatively proximity, students using the Loomis-Michael Observatory had an opportunity to see it up close—an occasion not predicted to occur again until 2028.
Spahr said last night’s event was of great scientific importance since asteroids have so much data to offer and are rarely seen so close to Earth. Spahr stressed that objects with the potential to strike Earth are constantly being monitored and their trajectories calculated, and that last night’s event was deemed totally “routine” as far as asteroids go.
Amanda T. Pillsbury, a student at the Graduate School of Education, described the asteroid as “a small black dot racing across the sky near the moon.” She said watching it pass by was “a very cool experience.”
Physics major Jeremy S. Cushman ’12 said that last night was “a great night for science,” but added that “if it was to hit the Earth it would be catastrophic.”
The asteroid will provide scientists with data that they have not been able to obtain before, Spahr said, thanks to technology that didn’t exist when the 1972 asteroid passed.
Spahr also said that although we are safe from this passing, there are many asteroids that scientists will be mapping in the future. It’s the “ones that are years away that we really need to worry about.”

Cambridge residents reelected eight of nine incumbent Councillors to the Cambridge City Council, according to preliminary election results announced last night.
Poll workers counted 15,393 valid ballots, a decrease from the final ballot count of 15,955 in 2009, though preliminary results do not include write-in, auxiliary, provisional, and overseas absentee ballots.
Renewing their terms are Councillors Leland Cheung, Timothy J. Toomey Jr., Mayor David P. Maher, Vice Mayor Henrietta S. Davis, Craig Kelley, E. Denise Simmons, Marjorie C. Decker, and Kenneth E. Reeves ’72. Minka Y. vanBeuzekom will replace two-term incumbent Sam Seidel, the only incumbent to lose.
The final vote counts have not been determined.
Reeves was reelected for his twenty-third year on the City Council. He said one of his first priorities in office will be to secure funding for the Office of College Success, which was launched to help young people get to and through college. The City Manager has not funded the program, though Reeves said he may in the future. Reeves added that he hopes to secure funding before his current term ends.
“I will continue to work as hard as I can for the people of Cambridge,” he said.
Mayor David P. Maher, who will serve his seventh term on City Council, said he will continue to concentrate on education.
“The issue that I have been focusing on is improving the public education experience,” he said. “We’ll wait and see what my role will be this term.”
Voter turnout varied in each of Cambridge’s 11 wards and 33 precincts.
Grace E. Bowen, who is Warden for ward 4, precinct 2 at City Hall, said that 1,001 ballots were counted in her precinct. That number, when divided by two to account for both the City Council and School Board elections, amounts to approximately 500 voters.
“People in Cambridge are pretty conscientious,” said Bowen, who has worked as a Warden for 10 years.
Reeves’s campaign manager Rachel A. Offerdahl said that based on Twitter updates during the day from polling volunteers, voter turn-out this year appeared to be “ridiculously low.” But she later said that a good total turn-out would be 15,000 voters, which was near the actual turn-out.
To encourage residents to vote, Reeves drove around Cambridge with a bullhorn. Earlier in the day, Reeves said, he voted, visited polling places, and paid his respects to deceased family and friends who supported him throughout his political career.
“She’s my good luck charm,” he said of his late mother.
While 734 residents were registered to vote at the polling location at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, only about 70 had voted as of 7:00 p.m., one hour before the polls closed.
“I’ve voted in every election since I got my citizenship ten years ago,” said Denise Chamberland, a Cambridge resident who immigrated to the United States from Canada in 1968. “I think in this country people don’t vote only because they have the luxury of not voting.”
Cambridge Resident Benedict F. Fitzgerald, who is 98 years old, was surprised that so few people were at the Harvard Design School polling location.
“I’ve seen a lot of elections and I vote every year,” he said. “It’s incredible that so few people vote.
The average young guy can name the best ball player but can’t name anyone on the council.”
Lauren B. Plavisch, who worked on Matt P. Nelson’s campaign, disagreed that voter turnout was low. “I’m an example of someone who was mobilized,” she said.
“I’ve never been involved in a campaign before. This is my first vote for a City Council election ever. I would say a lot of people on the campaign are like me.”

Award-winning documentary “Severina’s Story” was screened at the Law School Tuesday night as part of an event called Interpreting Abortion. The event sought to foster an interdisciplinary conversation about the abortion debate.
“It is really important for the Harvard community to think about abortion in a more nuanced way,” said Lisa M. Kelly, a doctoral student at the Law School and the event organizer. “Abortion policy has real impacts on real people and it is also a more complex question sometimes than our debates suggest.”
Organizers said they wanted to present a discussion that approached abortion from various disciplines.
The documentary was directed by Debora Deniz, a bioethics professor at the Universidade de Brasilia, and followed the trail of Severina, a Brazilian woman whose planned abortion was interrupted at the last minute by a court ruling. Severina was carrying a child with anencephaly, an unsurvivable condition in which the fetus is missing the majority of its brain and skull. On the night Severina was hospitalized to undergo her procedure, the Brazilian Supreme Court overturned the injunction that allowed abortion in the case of anencephaly.
Diniz emphasized the personal impact of abortion on women’s lives in the post-film discussion.
“Severina is human, she is not a feminist thesis,” she said. “This allows us to have a connection with her.”
Diniz also said that a similar documentary would not have been made in the United States.
Harvard Law Professor Jeannie C. Y. Suk, one of the panelists at the event, said the film emphasized the “temporariness, uncertainty, inbetweeness” that women like Severina may face.
“[There is an] intense ambiguity about what is going on,” she said of Severina’s delivery. “Is it a birth or a death?”
Kate M. Aizpuru, a board-member of Harvard Law Students for Reproductive Justice, said she thought the documentary highlighted the complex issue well.
“I think it is very important to show that average, married women also get abortions, especially in the United States were there is a stigma that it is only single or fallen women getting abortions,” she said.

The six-member Cambridge School Committee was elected Tuesday night from a narrow field of 11 candidates.
Afred B. Fantini, Patricia M. Nolan, Alice L. Turkel, Richard Harding Jr., and Marc C. McGovern were re-elected to the Committee. Mervan F. Osborne, a first-time candidate, joined the Committee with the fourth-most votes.
Massachusetts House Representative Alice K. Wolf said the results were not surprising because the election had “a number of strong incumbents.”
Based on the preliminary vote count released at 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday, 14,939 ballots had been cast in the School Committee election, compared to 15,393 ballots cast for the City Council. These results do not include absentee, provisional, and auxiliary ballots, or write–in votes.
School Committee candidate John J. Holland suggested that the discrepancy between the two elections may be a result of voters not knowing the School Committee candidates or not having a stake in the election results because they do not have school–aged children.
Cambridge resident Karen Carmean said that a low voter-turnout does not reflect a lack of interest from Cambridge residents.
“Cambridge residents are very conscientious,” she said.
“I look for people who ask questions, who look at the finances, who take risks.”
Alice L. Turkel was reelected to her sixth term on the Committee on Tuesday. Turkel said that she ran a campaign focused on face-to-face contact, in contrast to some candidates. “There were a lot of technology driven, underground campaigns that don’t have a lot of visibility,” she said.
“If I call Obama, I don’t expect him to pick up the phone and talk to me. But in Cambridge, voters expect a response from their government. People are entrusting their children to us.”
But for Osborne, the only non–incumbent elected to the School Committee, an internet–focused approach proved successful.
“[Osborne] had been told that you can’t win the first time you run,” Cambridge resident Doane Perry, Carmean’s husband, said. “[But] it’s all about name recognition. He got his name out by making videos on the Internet and with Twitter.”
Unsuccessful first–time School Committee candidate Bill Forster said that although he believed a low voter-turnout favored incumbents in non-presidential election years, those elected to the committee represent the range of views found in Cambridge.
“We have some real diversity of opinions in this group,” he said. “It’s not everybody just saying the same thing. We have very different opinions on what should be done to the system and how things should be handled.”

Amid a swirl of tutu-clad women handing out fliers to the beats of Beyonce and the Spice Girls, the Undergraduate Council presidential candidates campaigned outside of the Science Center Tuesday morning.
UC presidential candidates Crystal D. Trejo ’13 and Danny P. Bicknell ’13 greeted passersby.
“Our basic philosophy is, we want to make contact with every student on campus,” Trejo said of the campaign strategy she and vice presidential candidate David H. A. LeBoeuf ’13 are employing.
Bicknell echoed this sentiment. He characterized his and vice presidential candidate Pratyusha Yalamanchi ’13’s campaign style as inclusive. “As UC leaders, we want to be very visible, very approachable on campus,” he said.
Both sets of candidates emphasized that campaigning at the Science Center was a way to reach a broad array of students, some of whom are not involved in student groups—another major target of presidential campaigning.
The UC-outsider ticket of presidential candidate Ryan P. Halprin ’12 and vice presidential candidate Aneliese K. Palmer ’12 was conspicuously absent from the scene outside the Science Center.
“I’m a joke candidate,” Halprin said when contacted for this article.
Bicknell noted his campaign’s attempt to reach freshmen.
“A lot of first years don’t realize that presidential elections happen in November,” Bicknell said.
To spread awareness among freshmen, both UC camps have begun canvassing in freshman dormitories.
On Tuesday afternoon, Yalamanchi, accompanied by Weld resident Christian Ramirez ’15, went door-to-door in Weld pitching her ticket’s platform.
“We’re very connected to the first-year experience,” Yalamanchi said, citing Bicknell’s personal experience with the social woes of freshman men. At each room, she highlighted the ticket’s plan and invited students to express their concerns.
The Trejo campaign also went door-to-door in the freshman dorms Tuesday evening.
Freshman reaction to UC door-knockinig varied.
“It’s kind of annoying, honestly,” Richard Y. Liu ’15 said after a visit from Yalamanchi. But he added, “I don’t mind standing there for a few minutes as long as it’s meaningful.”
Fellow Weld resident Adrian W. Jones ’15 reacted positively to canvassing UC candidates.
“I appreciate that they’re willing to reach out to freshmen to try to earn their vote,” he said.
Trejo said that she is trying to avoid certain campaign strategies. “Sometimes UC campaigns turn into big posters with people shouting. We’ll have a poster, but it will be stand-alone, so that it’s not the center of attention,” she said.
Picknell stood in front of the Science Center by a large red poster emblazoned with his and Yalamanchi’s names.
“The banner is a selling point,” he said with a smile.

“Stout, Apache-dark, curious and quick, he builds up the bridge of his nose with clay,” read Eduardo C. Corral. “In the small of his back, I bury my hands.”
Corral and fellow poets Rosa Alcalá and Aracelis Girmay were the featured speakers at the inaugural Latino/a Poetry Now event held Tuesday night at the Barker Center. The reading drew an audience of 30, many of them members of the Cambridge community.
“Our goal is to feature distinct, dynamic voices from the Latino poetry community,” said event organizer Francisco Aragón about the initiative, which will feature 15 poets in total.
“We want to deepen the conversation around Latino poetry by giving the audience a taste of how diverse Latino voices can be,” he said.
The artists’ poetry touched on topics as varied as cultural traditions, poverty, and sexuality, but they expressed frustration about often being artistically pigeonholed based on their race. Corral recalled a colleague asking to see his “field worker poems.”
Alcalá, who is currently a creative writing teacher in the Bilingual MFA program at the University of Texas at El Paso, told the story of her journey to academia after growing up as a self-described “working class kid.” Her poems expressed her experiences growing up in New Jersey as the daughter of Spanish immigrants.
Working in higher education, she said, was “the first time no one I knew worked in a factory.”
“Factory is both fact and act and mere letters away from face and story,” Alcalá recited.
Girmay, an assistant professor at Hampshire College, read a poem about assimilating in elementary school without losing her identity.
“It is as if I handed [my teacher] all my familiar trees and flowers, and she used her English to make an axe and try to chop them down,” she said.
The next event in the series will take place at Georgetown University and feature different poets.
“It was wonderful,” said Josslyn J. Luckett, a student at the Divinity School.  “I didn’t know these poets before tonight, but I love them now.”

UPDATED: 2:00 a.m. 11/10/11
WOBURN, Mass.—Adam B. Wheeler, a former Harvard student who pleaded guilty in December to faking his way into Harvard through falsified transcripts, standardized test scores, and letters of recommendation—as well as bilking the University out of more than $45,000—was put back in jail Wednesday without bail after a brief hearing in the Middlesex Superior Court.
Wheeler, who was sentenced to ten years of probation in December, allegedly violated the condition of his probation that prohibits him from portraying himself as a Harvard student or claiming that he ever attended Harvard.
Probation officer Angelo Gomez Jr. said in court today that Wheeler broke violated that term when he submitted a resume to U.S. Green Data, Inc. that said he had attended Harvard.
Gomez and Middlesex Assistant District Attorney John C. Verner presented the case to Superior Court Justice Diane M. Kottmyer, arguing that Wheeler was a flight risk and needed to be held without bail until he appears for a hearing about the allegation.
Wheeler’s attorney Steven A. Sussman did not contest the allegation but argued that his client should not be held in jail because he needed to be working and was emotionally “fragile.”
When he pleaded guilty late last year, Wheeler was a part-time employee at a non-profit organization in Boston. Sussman said in court today that Wheeler later worked full-time for that non-profit but then lost the job in July.
Sussman said that after Wheeler lost his job, he felt financial pressure to pay rent for his apartment in Somerville and the $45,806 restitution to Harvard ordered by the court. Wheeler had only just found a new job—performing manual labor—a week ago before he was summoned to court today for this alleged violation.
Sussman said that Wheeler was not a flight risk because he voluntarily appeared in court on Wednesday.
Sussman also said that he believes his client will return to court whenever he is called back. Going to jail would be particularly harmful for Wheeler because his absence could cost him his job and return him to a precarious financial state, Sussman said.
“I think he realizes that he needs to step back from this intellectual pursuit [for a job],” Sussman added, noting that Wheeler is still receiving psychological therapy.
Kottmyer at first expressed reluctance to hold Wheeler, saying that the Cambridge jail is currently overcrowded. But she said that she was convinced that the threat of a two-and-a-half year prison stay—which Wheeler faces if he is found to have violated his probation—as well as his mental health, indicate that he should be held until his next hearing date, which has been set for Nov. 17.
Wheeler’s parents, who reside in Delaware and were in court today, declined to comment.
Wheeler made headlines in May 2009 when he was indicted for faking his way into Harvard and then scooping up several prestigious grants and prizes, largely through forgery and fraud.
He was accepted to Harvard as a transfer student in 2007, based on his application, which claimed he had earned a perfect SAT score and perfect grades as a high school student at the elite Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and as a freshman at MIT. In fact, he had been a good but unremarkable student at a public high school in Delaware. He had then attended Bowdoin College in Maine, where he was suspended in his second year for academic dishonesty.
At Harvard, Wheeler won a Hoopes Prize as a junior, English department awards, and a David Rockefeller International Experience Grant—all using plagiarized essays. His deceits were uncovered in the fall of his senior year at Harvard, when he applied for Harvard’s nomination for the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships and was caught turning in an essay plagiarized from English Professor Stephen Greenblatt as his own work.
Alerted that he was under suspicion, Wheeler quickly left Harvard. But he did not stop his frauds.
He applied to Yale, Brown, Stanford, and a maritime program at Williams College, as well as internship programs at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital and the magazine The New Republic, claiming on all those applications that he was a Harvard undergraduate. Stanford and Williams accepted him as a transfer student.
He was arrested in May 2010 on 20 felony and misdemeanor counts including identity fraud and larceny—for the $45,806 in grants, prizes, and Harvard financial aid which he received during his time as an undergraduate at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 4:34 a.m. 11/10/11
A tent city was hastily constructed in front of University Hall Wednesday night during a tense dialogue between “Occupy Harvard” protesters and Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson.
The occupation followed a protest on campus involving more than roughly 350 participants sympathetic to the Occupy movement, during which Harvard Yard was shut down by Harvard University Police officers and Securitas guards.
The protest was intended to convey disapproval of the University’s perceived complicity in growing income inequality across the country. Participants included students, staff, faculty, and community members.
Around 7 p.m., protesters were met with increased security that would prevent Boston residents who were not Harvard affiliates from entering the Yard.
“I think it’s absurd. Do we really need eight guards per gate?” said Nicandro G. L. Iannacci ’13, who has participated in other Occupy events. “The idea that the only people allowed here to have this conversation are members of the Harvard community, specifically, is wrong. Why not welcome more people in?”
In response to the limited access to the Yard, demonstrators relocated to the Harvard Law School campus. As they marched past freshman dorms, they chanted, “Out of your rooms and into the Yard,” rallying the students in the dorms to join.
After a general assembly, protesters left the Law School campus and tried to re-enter the Yard to set up a tent city, but Securitas guards prevented demonstrators from entering by locking the gates.
In a tense exchange, students tried to push their way into the Yard—some holding up their Harvard IDs—while guards pushed back to prevent protesters from breaking through the gates.
Protesters moved to Mass. Ave, attempting to enter the Yard through the Widener Library entrance, but were rebuked by HUPD and Securitas guards.
As protesters tried to enter the Yard through the Widener entrance, confused bystanders watched from across the street.
“I think it’s a little ridiculous. People need to get in, people have things to do.
Harvard is being a little overcautious,” said Leonie A. Oostrom ’15, who was not participating in the protest but lives in the Yard. “I think it’s almost dangerous to have the gates closed.”
Several gates were opened and closed throughout the night, causing confusion among the freshmen who did not know where they could enter, if at all.
After hours of attempting to get into the Yard, students with Harvard IDs were allowed to re-enter in small numbers. Once inside, a group of about 40 protesters convened in the basement of Thayer Hall to plan how they would construct the tent city.
At about 10:30 p.m., roughly 120 demonstrators—mostly Harvard students—linked arms and created a circle in front of the John Harvard Statue within which they began to assemble the tents.
As the protesters were constructing their tent city, Nelson emerged and attempted to convince the occupiers to move the tents to Tercentenary Theatre, where they would be less disruptive.
Protesters rejected her suggestion but said they would consider relocating the tents if they become too troublesome.
Nelson ultimately agreed to allow the tent city to camp in front of University Hall and asked to meet with the protesters on Thursday regarding the future of the occupation. The protesters’ terms for the meeting include adhering to their principle of consensus-based decision making and inclusive participation.
“I would like this meeting to be the beginning of a conversation,” Nelson said.
Harvard Kennedy School Lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 said that relocating the protest to the Law School campus earlier in the night was a way of assuring that the demonstrators could assemble and make their statement heard.
“This country was founded on the freedom of speech, of assembly, of petition, of religion, and of the press. Tonight, the country seems to deny the most essential freedom,” McCarthy told a crowd while at the Law School. “The press could not get in, so the people who speak will come to a place where the press can hear us, where we can be heard, where we can be seen.”
Throughout the night, various protesters—including several Harvard employees—voiced their concerns about economic conditions across the country. Other concerns included stalled contract negotiations and employment benefits.
“I’m here because I think this is one of the most important social uprisings in modern American history,” McCarthy said. “I believe deeply that this is a moment in America’s history that requires such a people’s movement. I’m happy to be part of it.”
He also said that the University has a responsibility to the community.
“If Harvard is going to be a place that produces people with power, then Harvard must be an institution where the public good is more important than private profit,” McCarthy said. Earlier, he told a crowd that “Harvard has economists that teach us that profits are more important than people.”
Protesters said that they wanted to bring a public dialogue to Harvard regarding the University’s role in the country and, more broadly, the world.
“Harvard is one of the most well-known private institutions of the world. We have a lot of clout with what we do,” said Evelyn M. Atkinson, a third year Law School student. “I’d say that the public footprint of a private institution like Harvard is really big.”
Sahil A. Khatod ’14 shared Atkinson’s view about the University’s responsibility.
“My frustration with Harvard has to do with the fact that there isn’t a dialogue about what’s happening off campus,” Khatod said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brogan Berry, Harvard women’s basketball co-captain, was recently nominated as one 30 nominee’s nationwide for the exclusive Lowe’s Senior CLASS Award.
An acronym for Celebrating Loyalty and Achievement for Staying in School®, the award is looking for the “total student-athlete,” and it hopes to encourage students to use their athletic platform to make a positive impact as community leaders.
“I’ve heard about a couple of past Harvard athletes being nominated, even past teammates and past opponents I’ve played,” Berry said.  “Looking back I admired a lot of those athletes for what they do on the court and off the court ... so when I was accepted as a nominee, I was just blown away because they all have been such great inspirations and it’s an honor to be put on the same playing field as them.”
The award targets NCAA Division I seniors who have notable achievements in four areas of excellence: community, classroom, character, and competition.
All four are clear strengths for the Crimson point guard, in fact the award's website provides a detailed description of how she meets each of the ‘four C’s of excellence.'
Berry, a psychology concentrator, has served as the community service co-chair for Harvard’s Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, where she was responsible for organizing the event Bench Press for Breast Cancer which raised over $1,700 for breast cancer research.
Berry has also been a tutor at the Mission Hill After School Program, a housing residence in the low income section of Roxbury.
And her achievements on the court have been just as impressive.
When Berry graduates in May, she will be among the most decorated student-athletes in Crimson’s history. She currently ranks 13th in program history with 1,071 career points and is sixth all-time with 397 career assists. She has led the Ivy League in assists each of the last two years and ranked second in scoring in 2010-11
Of the 30 nominees, it will be narrowed down to 10 by a national media committee in January. Those ten names will be put on an official ballot for a nation wide vote. This fan balloting will count for 1/3 of the final decision, while coaches and media members will account for the other 2/3.
“I’m trying not to get my hopes up too much because I looked at the list and theres a lot of commended other athletes,” Berry said. “So I’m just trying to keep a level head ... even being nominated is a huge honor just in itself.”
Berry, who hopes to play professionally in Europe after she graduates, has other things on her mind besides the Lowe’s award.
“I’m so excited,” Berry said. “We have our first game in less than three days and I couldn’t be more thrilled!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A fortnight before the Harvard men’s squash team’s first match, sophomore Ali Farag is already doing the team proud.
On Oct 28th-Oct 30th he represented the Crimson well at the Price-Bullington Invitational in Richmond, Va., taking home first place out of 16 competitors and beating two Ivy League foes in the process.
In the tournament’s first round, Farag dismantled the winner of the Qualifier tournament and then beat Adam Perkimoaki, a junior at the University of Rochester in his second match. In the semi-finals, Farag took down Yale Junior Kenneth Chang, setting up a final match against Ramit Tandon from Columbia. Tandon was the topped ranked junior in India during the 2010-2011 season and is a player Farag is quite familiar with.
“I’ve seen him play since he was a kid because we played in Europe together,” Farag said. “He is getting better.”
Still, Farag was able to overcome his Lion opponent and reclaim the championship for the Crimson. After the three-year reign in Richmond of former Harvard student Colin West, a competitor from Cornell took the prize last year.
“It’s big to win it and bring trophy back to Harvard,” Farag said. “I’m happy to bring it back.”
The win was far from Farag’s first run-in with success. The Cairo native placed second in the 2010 World Juniors - falling to a fellow Egyptian - and is a U19 British Junior Open Champion.
While Farag is accustomed to victory, he said that his first tournament since coming to America felt a bit different.
“I’m not holding my name only [now],” Farag said. “I’m holding the Harvard name so it’s big to win it. I have to win because of Harvard.”
He will hope to continue his success in his first year in Cambridge after studying at The American University in Cairo last year. While there, Farag served as captain on an Egypt Junior Squash team that won the 2010 world title.
Sophomore Nigel Koh was also among the  top amateurs who accepted an invitation to compete in the longest running invitational squash tournament in the U.S. Beyond the honor bestowed upon the victor of the main draw, competitors vie for confidence going into scholastic tournaments because a finalist in the Price-Bullington Invitational often goes on to win in the Squash Nationals.
Farag will have his Harvard debut in the season opener against Williams on November 18.
“I’m optimistic about the season,” Farag said. “We have a good chance to win it. We’ve got some good players. We have12 players who are all competing for the top line.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We celebrate Harvard-Yale because we believe it to be a battle between some of the nation’s best and brightest. The experience would be somewhat cheapened if arguably the most brilliant player, both academically and athletically, doesn’t get to play.
Those who have been following Ivy League football this year probably know that Bulldogs’ field general Patrick Witt is currently deciding whether he will play his final game at Yale against Harvard or interview for the Rhodes Scholarship.
It’s a decision he shouldn’t have to make.
Other than “literary and scholastic achievement," which Witt has achieved in the classroom already with a 3.91 grade point average, playing in the game encompasses all of the standards set forth by Cecil Rhodes. His success at quarterback demonstrates his “energy to use one’s talents to the full, as exemplified by fondness for and success in sports” and “moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one’s fellow beings.”
Of course, if one reads the Rhodes brochure further, it clarifies that it does not require its applicants to boast “outstanding achievement in organized sports.” And one seeking to argue against playing in The Game could reason that Witt has already demonstrated his ability to lead.
But it’s hard to get around that third standard: “truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship.” Truth, courage, and kindliness can be shown in other ways, certainly. Unselfishness and fellowship? These definitely hint at standing with your team. And “devotion to duty?" That one’s pretty clear cut.
Barring a change of circumstances, Witt would need to break away from some of the virtues the Rhodes Scholarship honors. From all of the articles I’ve read, Yale’s quarterback seems to understand the gravity of his decision and the prestige of both the scholarship he is pursuing and the storied football game he might be missing. While I may disagree with Witt’s final decision, I will certainly respect that he has considered his options thoroughly and that he will have to face both his family and his team when he chooses.
Rather, it is the Rhodes Trust which is being hypocritical if it refuses to budge on the timing or location of the interview. Witt has options. His outstanding GPA and offer from Boston Consulting Group show that. So does the interest he has generated from NFL scouts. He has a bright future ahead of him, regardless of what he chooses. It’s the Rhodes that will come off worse for the wear.
Let’s imagine for a second that Witt chooses to forego the Rhodes Scholarship and take on the Crimson instead. His legacy will be marked, perhaps only slightly, by the fact that he turned down the Rhodes Scholarship because he saw something else to be more important. Here, Witt’s moral decision goes against the Rhodes Scholarship. Does the Rhodes Trust really want people to think that the right thing to do is to turn down its scholarship?
Next, let’s imagine that Witt ditches his final college game to go to an interview. How can you, the Rhodes Trust, name as a scholar someone who left his duty to his team in order to pursue individual glory? Is that the kind of unselfishness the Rhodes Scholarship seeks to honor? On the other hand, if the hypocrisy of the Rhodes is recognized a little too late, can the Rhodes reject someone because it disagrees with a decision that it mandated he make?
The Rhodes Scholarship should recognize the inherent problems with forcing Witt to choose between his interview and his football game.
When Florida State’s Myron Rolle was applying for a Rhodes, he was flown from his interview in Alabama to his team’s game against Maryland. He won the game and the Rhodes.
Witt has reportedly been offered private plane rides as well, but the timing of the game and the potential for a callback render these  offers useless.
But I have a hard time believing that there is nothing that can be done. Zar Zavala '11 was able to make it back to campus in time for the second half of last year’s Game after interviewing in Texas. If interviews can be scheduled such that a player who does not receive playing time can make it to the second half, there must be some way to ensure that a starter can make it back in time for kickoff.
Don’t tell me that Harvard, Yale, and the Rhodes Trust can’t figure something out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston is considered by many to be the center of the sports analytics universe, and many here on campus have played a substantial role in that. Last spring, Harvard College Sports Analytics Collective (HSAC) junior co-President John Ezekowitz was featured on the cover of the Boston Globe Magazine. Sophomore Andrew Mooney  writes an aptly named column, “Stats Driven,” for Boston.com, and senior co-President David Roher, also a coxswain for Harvard lightweight crew, regularly contributes for Deadspin.
HSAC members publish independent research on our blog and are also engaged in sports analytics through the writing of academic papers, collaboration with other media outlets, and even employment with professional teams. Our presence in the sports analytics community at-large is continuously growing, but our presence on campus is minimal at best.
Part of this is due to HSAC’s lack of commentary on Crimson athletics. Here follows a short introduction to sports analytics’ applications to the Harvard fall season:
One of the simplest, and most commonly used, measures of a team’s quality–other than its straight-up win-loss record–is Bill James’ Pythagorean Win Expectation. The stat, more commonly referred to as a team’s “Pythag,” predicts a team’s winning percentage by dividing points scored squared over points scored squared plus points allowed squared. This is a more accurate estimation of a team’s quality because it values a 5-0 win greater than a 4-3 win and attempts to filter out “luck.” The football team, with 331 points scored and 144 allowed, has a PWE of .841 and a real win percentage of .875. The women’s soccer team has a PWE of .667 and a real win percentage of .735 with 34 goals and 24 points allowed. The field hockey team has scored 34 goals and allowed 37 for a PWE of .458 and a real win percentage of .471.
The validity of the application of Pythagorean win expectation to sports other than baseball is unclear. Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, a Northwestern and MIT grad, created a pythag expectation formula for basketball that multiplies points for and against to the power of 13.91 rather than two. But as a rough estimate of a team’s “luck,” the baseball model does seem to do a good job.
Another popular method is attempting to evaluate a player’s value to a team. This has resulted in statistics such as Wins Above Replacement Player (WAR) in baseball and Defense-adjusted Value Over Average (DVOA) in football.
Having covered field hockey this season, I can tell you anecdotally that there were numerous times when junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos single-handedly kept the Crimson in the game. Harvard gave up 69 more shots on goal to its opponents than it managed to take, while only allowing three more goals. That amounts to a disparity in save percentage of .806 for Tassopoulos and .754 for the Crimson’s opponents.
This is as much an indictment of the Harvard defense as it is a celebration of Tassopoulos’ performance. If you were to replace Tassopoulos with the “average” Ivy-League goalie, who would have a save percentage of .735, the Crimson would be expected to give up 55 goals. Using the Pythag formula, that means it would be expected to have a winning percentage of just .276. Over a 17-game season, that amounts to roughly a 5-12 record, meaning Tassopoulos was single-handedly worth an astonishing three of Harvard’s eight wins. That doesn’t even take into account her much-lauded role as an organizer of the defense.
Ivy-League co-champion Princeton had the lowest save percentage of any team in the Ancient Eight. If you were to replace Tigers goalie Christina Maida with Tassopoulos, 9-7 Princeton would be expected to go 13-3.
When we think of who the “Most Valuable Player” across a variety of sports is, we generally think of the quarterback on the winning football team or the leading scorer on the basketball team. Rarely do we think of the goalie on a losing team who gave up more goals than her team scored, but maybe we should.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While NFL teams are just beginning the second half of their regular seasons, competition is heating up in China as the best of 44 universities compete in the National University Flag Football League playoffs, all under the eye of Kai-Cheng Ho ’10.
Ho, a former Crimson running back now participating in the NFL’s junior rotational program, has made major improvements to the burgeoning game, according to co-worker Stephanie Hsiao.
“He’s taken the reins and made a lot of structural improvements in training and game operations … and just making the experience much better for the players involved,” Hsiao said. “Given his background as a player, he understands what players are looking for and what matters the most for them. He’s done a great job improving the flag football program.”
Specifically, Ho has implemented statistical record-keeping, better documentation of games via flipcams and cameras, and more comprehensive referee training, all since arriving in the Middle Kingdom in June. In his short time in charge, Ho said he has already seen progress.
“There was just a huge difference between the regular season games and now. It is turning into a very competitive semifinal,” Ho said. “It is encouraging to see how cohesive the players are as a unit. I am able to see the same emotion that you see in the States in China.”
It has not been an easy task to build a groundswell of interest in football among the natives, but Ho understands their apprehension about the sport.
“I thought the game was stupid,” Ho said. “I thought, ‘Why in the hell were players wearing helmets and shoulder pads playing a sport? That’s just ridiculous. There is no way anyone can convince me to play this game.’”
But after moving to America from Taiwan at the age of 13, Ho soon began to see football’s power.
“I started playing the game and I loved it,” he said. “I learned a lot ... It’s a game that builds you into a man. It’s a life changer.”
Ho said football could be especially valuable in China.
“Academics is everything here,” he said. “[There’s] a huge pressure to perform. Having football opens a door for students. By playing sports you can handle stress that much more wisely. It can affect your outcome in life.”
While Ho understands that football is still a niche sport in the country compared to basketball, badminton, and ping pong, he has seen encouraging signs of acceptance from locals.
“I was just watching a university game in Beijing and out of nowhere a young woman came up and started asking all kinds of questions about the game,” Ho said.
Ho replied by asking how the woman had become interested in the foreign game.
“I was surprised by her answer,” he said.
The woman said she first become interested in the game while watching the Super Bowl two years ago and found out as much information as she could about the sport.
“She went to our website earlier that week and found out we had games going on in Beijing,” Ho said. “She found out the time and the date and the location and traveled two hours from where she lived to go to the game by herself, just to watch the university flag football. I was really touched by that. I was really encouraged and surprised.”
Long before he showed up in Beijing, Ho’s experiences at Harvard helped give him confidence in his ability to sell a sport to the uninitiated. Before his senior year, Ho, along with the help of several other students, founded People of the Crimson, a student group dedicated to increasing student attendance at athletic events, particularly basketball games.
Fellow founder Hugh Archibald, a senior, said Ho was crucial in the group’s success.
“Cheng was a big part of why People of the Crimson worked properly,” Archibald said. “He is incredibly outgoing and did a lot of the legwork with boosters and others. The best way to describe him is always passionate.”
Harvard coach Tim Murphy said that Ho is now the perfect salesman for the game.
“He’s the perfect guy for a lot of reasons,” Murphy said. “If there is a better salesperson/ambassador for football, I don’t know who it would be. Cheng could sell anything, and I mean that in the most positive way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard field hockey (8-9, 3-4 Ivy) enjoyed quite the turnaround season this fall. In winning five more games than last year, the Crimson made a case for a return to prominence in the Ivy League.
The Ancient Eight recognized this in honoring four members of the team with a variety of All-Ivy honors. Co-captain forward Carly Dickson was named first-team All-Ivy. It was her fourth conference honor, achieving first-team recognition her freshman year, and second-team honors both her sophomore and junior seasons. Dickson’s co-captain, defender Georgia McGillivray was named second-team all-conference for her efforts this year. She had previously received honorable mention recognition.
Rounding out the honors, were junior goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos and freshman forward Noel Painter, both of whom were honorable mention honorees. Though it is certainly an honor, it’s possible that they both deserved even higher accolades. Decide for yourself after the jump.
Goalkeeper:
1st Team:
Christie O’Hara (Columbia), .784 save% (2nd Ivy, 8th natl.), 8.00 saves/game (2nd Ivy, 10th natl.) 
2nd Team:
Emily Cain (Yale), .752 save% (3rd Ivy, 21st natl.) 5.35 save/game (6th Ivy, 33rd natl.)
Honorable Mention:
Tassopoulos, .806 save% (1st Ivy, 3rd natl.), 9.06 saves/game (1st Ivy, 7th natl.) 
Freshman Forwards:
1st Team:
Allison Evans (Princeton), 10 goals (4th Ivy, 48th natl.), 25 points
2nd Team:
Ali Savage (Dartmouth), 12 goals (3rd Ivy, 32nd natl.), 27 points (3rd Ivy)
Honorable Mention:
Painter, 8 goals (10th Ivy), 20 points
