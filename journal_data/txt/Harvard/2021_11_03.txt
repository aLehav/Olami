After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yes, you heard me right: Let’s make tuition $1 million dollars. This probably seems radical at first, but hear me out. Harvard is infamous for its already exorbitant cost of attendance, which climbs ever higher each fall. This year, students living on campus were asked to shell out a total of $74,528. Harvard also has a remarkably generous system of need-based financial aid, one which would enable most potential applicants to study here tuition-free. Families with an annual income less than $65,000 — for context, median family income in the United States sits right above this cut-off — are typically asked to pay nothing, making the actual average cost of attendance at Harvard a much more reasonable $12,000 per year.
On its financial aid webpage, Harvard claims that families “with incomes above $150,000 will be asked to pay proportionately more than 10 percent [of their income] based on their circumstances.” As there are certainly families at Harvard with annual incomes greater than $10 million, a statement like this would lead you to think that some students are already paying $1 million. In reality, some high-income families will spend quite a bit more than 10 percent of their income on tuition, and others will pay significantly less than 10 percent. Take, for example, two nearly identical families distinguished from one another solely by their income. One has an income of $350,000 and the other an income of $700,000. Harvard’s net price calculator offers no financial aid to either family, meaning that the first will send around 22.3 percent of their pre-tax income to Harvard, and the second will send only around 11.2 percent.
In the United States, where only roughly one-in-six families have incomes above $150,000, and even fewer have incomes large enough to disqualify them from financial aid at Harvard entirely, perhaps this wouldn’t present a problem. But at Harvard, where roughly 40 percent of students in the Class of 2024 do not receive financial aid, and nearly 30 percent of families have incomes greater than $250,000, a substantial amount of the class could afford to pay much more than $70,000 a year. In fact, a substantial amount of the freshman class, which resembles many before it, could do so while still paying a reasonably low percentage of their annual income to the university.
At the heart of need-based financial aid is a promise of equity: Everyone who can get into Harvard should be able to afford Harvard, too. The simple solution to the problem of the upper-middle-class family struggling to pay Harvard’s full tuition is to make our financial aid system more robust and cover their costs.
Where should that money come from? Well, it only seems fair to me that it comes from families who are paying an unfairly low percentage of their income to the University. There are a variety of ways to increase revenue by pulling more money from the top — for example, Harvard could pursue donations from wealthy families more aggressively — but it seems the simplest and most ethical is to raise tuition significantly. Financial aid will increase as well, as the College’s increased revenue will be funneled back into the program.
Those of you who are already thinking that $1 million is too much might be surprised when I tell you that I actually don’t think it’s enough. To fulfill a promise of equity, a tuition that works much more like a progressive tax is in order; the only limiting factor on tuition should be the income of the wealthiest Harvard family. One may argue that the pricing of most goods does not function this way, but that misses how essential a college education is to success for most Americans, relative to other goods.
The extra revenue from charging truly proportional tuition could change lives here: It would ensure that Harvard is a financial possibility for any student anywhere; it would send a message that Harvard is finally truly, fundamentally committed to equity; and most of all, it would enable the financial aid office to expand its programs for low-income students significantly.
Last summer, I was deeply disappointed to read the New York Times’s upsetting article about the College’s failure to support its low-income students during the pandemic. More recently, The Crimson’s own editorial board has discussed how the College’s decentralized aid systems perpetuate inequality on campus. Implicit in Harvard’s non-response to these students’ concerns is the supposed financial precariousness of offering such generous aid at this time. So why not eliminate the precariousness? Why not make tuition $1 million?

Those who read philosophy will often notice a recurring mention of nature. Thomas Hobbes and John Locke have their states of nature. Hegel has a philosophy of nature. Nietzsche stresses the importance of interpreting nature. Ancient Chinese philosophers see the structure of language as being reflective of the structure of nature. This is an arbitrarily formed list: Readers will surely have other examples spring to mind. This incessant talk of nature throughout the history of the field of philosophy should serve as a tip off that nature is worth thinking about.
The mention of nature, or should I say Nature, that I would like to focus on comes from an interview given by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright. “There is no school that is worth its existence, except as it is a form of Nature study,” he says. Going even further, he describes this capital n Nature as being, “all the body of God that we’re ever going to see.” It is worthwhile to take a moment to reflect on whether our own, or your own, course of study is a form of Nature study. In order to do this, we must first understand just what Wright means.
Let us first think about the role that nature (or Nature) has likely played for us. Nature acts as the great humbler in our lives. But also, the great supporter. Our first love, and our first enemy. Nature brings wonders such as snow when we are children. It gets us out of going to school. It provides bugs, birds, and legged animals for us to be in awe over. It also brings storms and lightning and deadly disasters. Events that bring us disappointment and fear and tragedy. Nature does all of these things with complete indifference. Reminding us that we are simply here. We are not consequential.
Despite this potentially dour affectation of nature, I have always been in love with n/Nature. This is surely inspired by my upbringing in rural West Virginia. From years of being surrounded by natural beauty. By the feeling of breathlessness that to this day accompanies the feeling of looking out over the river by my childhood home.
I can navigate to that particular spot with my eyes closed. You walk across the field. Down into the inlet. Across to the first island. If you go around, you won’t get your clothes wet. Make the leap over the notch the water has carved in the pointed edge of the first island. And when you walk out on the edge, that is when it hits you. The clouds. The sweeping mountain scene. The blue sky. The expanse. You are hit with a feeling of being unimportant in the most beautiful way. No matter what you do, that scene will be there. And you realize that not mattering is exactly what you needed in that moment. Sometimes, we must be reminded that we are not the center of the world.
In keeping with this existential Copernican revolution, we can look to our own Harvard Yard for a similar sentiment. “What is man that thou art mindful of him.” This is inscribed on Emerson Hall, the philosophy building at Harvard. The message is something that any good naturalist should adhere to. A thought surely had by anyone who has gazed upon a scene such as my mountain vista. This is edging closer to Wright’s Nature. The Nature that is the only body of God we are ever going to get to see.
For those readers who are thinking to themselves, “There is no way I am going to study biology,” let us return to providing a definition of Nature study. A useful, analogous sentiment to that of Wright’s can be sourced from mathematician Jean-Pierre Serre: “While other sciences search for the rules that God has chosen for the Universe, we Mathematicians search for the rules that even God has to obey.”
In Serre’s line, we see a shift from regarding nature as merely the things outdoors to what Wright wants us to see it as: the root of our experienced phenomena. Nature study can therefore occur in something as seemingly far removed as abstract, pure mathematics or something as applied as computational microbiology.
The motivation for this kind of study is the awe and wonder that can be felt standing at the edge of my river. Or the feeling of amazement when you complete a math proof. Or when you finish a breathtaking novel. There is not a set list of forms of Nature study. You will not find it as an addendum to your university’s course of study listing.
Wright gives no further guideline of what to study, to do so would in a sense be ludicrous. Instead, he leaves it as an exercise to us to ensure that what we are doing, that the education we are receiving, is a form of Nature study.

Harvard’s graduate student union reflected on its three-day strike at a membership-wide meeting Tuesday evening, discussing the University’s request for strikers to log hours of work withheld and next steps, including the possibility for a second strike.
The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers strike started on Oct. 27 after more than seven months of negotiations for its second contract with the University failed to produce agreements on three fronts: compensation, provisions for non-discrimination procedures, and agency shop, which requires all student workers in the bargaining unit to pay some form of compensation for union activities or a student worker health fund. The strike ended Friday night.
On Saturday, Paul R. Curran, director of the Office of Labor and Employee Relations, sent an email to all student workers represented by HGSU-UAW. Curran asked student workers to fill out a form indicating if they withheld paid labor over the strike by Thursday.
“Based on the information provided, the University may seek repayment of compensation you received for labor you withheld during the strike,” Curran wrote.
HGSU-UAW members immediately took to Twitter, pointing to Harvard’s record-high endowment returns and its budget surplus.
“Harvard’s $53B dollar endowment is larger than the GDP of dozens of countries, but it’s trying to force underpaid student workers to repay three days of wages from last week’s strike,” Rachel A. Jacoby, a graduate student at the Kennedy School, tweeted.
Other supporters of the union also weighed in online, including U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.).
“Dear Paul, I’m going to need you to give me a call about this,” Pressley tweeted, attaching a screenshot of Curran’s email.
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment.
While the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 protects workers’ right to strike, employers also have the right to withhold pay from strikers. In a union-wide email Saturday, HGSU-UAW leadership advised strikers to report their withheld labor to the University.
“It’s important for everyone who was on strike to say so, so that Harvard knows the full extent of our power,” they wrote.
Union leadership also asked members to email the University saying they do not consent to a wage deduction without negotiating with the union first.
Even as the union and the University assess the impacts of the first strike, HGSU-UAW membership discussed a possible second strike at the general membership meeting Tuesday.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla declined to share specific plans, but said in an interview after Tuesday’s meeting that the union is waiting for the University to put forth another proposal. In the meantime, he added, union members “are going to keep fighting.”
Anatoly “Toly” Rinberg, a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Physics, said on the picket line Friday that he wants the decision to go on strike again to “be made democratically and collectively,” even though the September strike authorization vote technically authorizes the bargaining committee to call additional strikes through Dec. 31.
“It’s a decision that I want to see made democratically and collectively,” Rinberg said. “We’ll wait to see if Harvard offers us something that is palatable to our members. Right now, it’s not good enough.”
According to a HGSU-UAW survey released Oct. 29, 81 percent of the 522 respondents indicated they would vote “no” to a tentative agreement without at least one of the union’s three main demands, and 71.4 percent indicated they would vote “no” to an agreement without at least two of those demands.
Steffan Paul ’19, a Ph.D. candidate in Medical Sciences, said in an interview Friday at the picket line they would not support a contract without new non-discrimination protections and raises that keep up with the rate of inflation.
“The fact that they are not giving us these very basic things, it’s kind of pathetic, and I think it’s about time we start expecting more from them,” they said. “So no, I’m not going to accept a contract that is subpar.”
Paul said they would go on strike again to achieve these demands.
On the picket line Friday, Thomas Y. George, a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering and Applied Sciences, also said he’s willing to go on strike again to achieve the union’s non-discrimination demands. Likewise, Phoebe B. Carter, a Ph.D. candidate in Literature and Comparative Literature, said that she would strike again if there is little progress in negotiations.
“I think that at this point, we’ve shown our power, we’ve shown that we can disrupt, we’ve shown how much grad students do, and hopefully this will make bargaining move forward,” Carter said. “But if it doesn’t, then we will go on strike again.”

Justin Y. Tseng ’22 was elected to Medford City Council on Tuesday, becoming the first Asian American to serve on the council.
Tseng, a first-generation Taiwanese American, moved to Medford at age 2 and attended Medford Public Schools. He announced his candidacy in March and ran on a progressive platform focused on affordable housing, school funding, and racial justice.
At age 21, Tseng will be one of the council’s youngest members ever. In an interview after his victory, Tseng said he was “a little bit speechless.”
“Even when I found myself trying to think about what the outcome would look like, it didn’t turn out like this,” he said.
Tseng received the fourth-most votes on Tuesday, finishing ahead of two incumbents. He was one of 14 candidates, including five incumbents, vying for seven open positions on the City Council.
“This was better than the optimal for me,” he said of the result.
In an interview earlier on Tuesday, Tseng attributed his electoral success to his team’s efforts on the ground.
“We have had conversations with thousands and thousands of people. I've personally had conversations with two to three thousand people,” he said. “The reason why we've done so much with ground game is because it's proven to be an effective campaign strategy, but also it’s important for the campaign itself.”
“For me myself, it was important that we brought politics to the people, and it was important that we thought outside of the bubbles that we operate in,” Tseng added. “By going door to door, you really get out of your comfort zone. You get out of your bubbles, and I think it's paid off.”
Tseng was one of five progressive council candidates who was endorsed by Our Revolution Medford. Four of the five were victorious, including incumbent Zac Bears, incumbent Nicole Morell, and Kit Collins.
Tseng said his first steps in office will include reaching out to his colleagues to find common ground, and reaching out to his supporters and municipal employees.
Despite its diverse electorate, Medford City Council has lacked representation from a councilor of color for decades. Tseng said he hopes to make progress on racial justice, including bringing “symbolic actions in favor of social justice and racial justice to my community.”
After his victory, Tseng expressed gratitude to his community for selecting him to represent them.
“I know that there’s a lot ahead of me in terms of the work that I have to do and there’s a huge responsibility on my shoulders, but I’m just at this moment really grateful and really thankful for the people of Medford for putting their trust in me,” he said.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences ended fiscal year 2021 with a $51 million surplus, according to the Dean’s annual report, which was presented during a monthly faculty meeting Tuesday.
That surplus represents a significant contrast from the school’s original projections, which expected a $112 million deficit for fiscal year 2021, as well as an improvement from the $16 million deficit the FAS ran in the previous fiscal year when including the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay encouraged faculty at the meeting Tuesday to think proactively about the future of the FAS given its strengthened financial position.
“We’ve invested enormous energy in maintaining excellence with the resources we have, and I know there hasn’t necessarily been space to imagine,” she said. “I’m here to tell you there is this space right now, and this is an earnest invitation to imagine what long-term excellence looks like and what will be required to get there.”
At a faculty meeting in April 2020, Gay outlined financial measures the FAS would follow to weather the pandemic. Those included prioritizing Harvard’s academic and research mission, bolstering support for financial aid, limiting faculty searches, and suspending faculty salary increases and bonus programs.
Gay annouced Tuesday that the FAS plans to make “targeted investments” using some of the surplus revenue, including spending $5 million to purchase new technology, such as cameras and screens, to equip offices and classrooms for hybrid and remote work.
“Just as we should not overreact with belt-tightening in hard times, we should not over-extend in good times,” she added. “So I make these investments with an eye toward our long-term academic excellence.”
Gay also announced that she has authorized 18 new ladder faculty searches, bringing the total to 66 searches for the 2021-22 academic year, accelerating faculty hires across all the three divisions of the FAS. The FAS conducted 31 ladder faculty searches in the previous academic year, resulting in 11 offers. At the start of the pandemic, Harvard announced a University-wide hiring freeze to trim its budget.
At the meeting, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 also recognized the 16 newly tenured members of the faculty. Only two tenure reviews were unsuccessful this year, and the tenure success rate for both women and faculty of color was 100 percent, according to the annual report.
Following Gay’s remarks, Dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning Nina Zipser noted the FAS’s faculty ranks dropped slightly during the pandemic, but forecasted that the accelerated faculty searches this year will lead to an uptick in new hires within the next two years.
Thirty-four faculty members departed Harvard in the last academic year, according to the report. Of these faculty, 12 retired, 11 were hired at other institutions, seven were unsuccessful in their promotion reviews, and four died.
Zipser also shared the FAS report’s findings on “unequal distribution of workload” between faculty of different demographic backgrounds, drawing on self-reported faculty activity data.
“We looked at the data and found that female assistant, associate, and tenured professors serve on more committees than male colleagues,” Zipser said. “This analysis does not include ‘invisible labor,’ which can be hours and hours of support — this leads to an unequal amount of time to do research and support one’s work.”
To act on the findings, Zipser said that she will assemble a faculty committee to “look at the distribution of service, teaching, and mentoring.”
Gay also told faculty at Tuesday’s meeting that the availability of Covid-19 booster shots and pediatric vaccine eligibility could mean “the spring looks and feels quite different.”
“Over the balance of the fall term, we are going to take steps to enable faculty to teach unmasked by next spring,” she said.
“Obviously, any significant changes to our core public health protocols will need to be decided by Health Services, but there are changes we can make at the FAS level to prepare with optimism for a different kind of spring,” she added.

After shutting down temporarily last week due to a fruit fly infestation, the Adams House dining hall will likely remain closed for the rest of the week while repair work gets underway to address the source of the scourge.
In a Monday email updating Adams residents on the situation, Faculty Deans Mercedes C. Becerra ’91 and Salmaan Keshavjee wrote that a broken pipe in the house’s food composting system is the apparent source of the infestation.
“Because of the broken pipe, compost material spilled into the crawl space area housing the pipes under the servery, and this, we believe, is the cause of our current situation with the flies in both the servery and other areas near the kitchen,” they wrote.
Students who frequent Adams dining hall first reported finding fruit flies in their food roughly three weeks ago. On Friday, the Adams faculty deans announced the temporary closure of the dining hall to battle the influx of the pests.
Becerra and Keshavjee wrote Monday that Harvard’s Environmental Health and Safety department maintains that the fruit fly presence “does not pose a measurable health hazard.”
Northeast Remediation and Remodeling began cleaning the crawl space Monday morning, according to Becerra and Keshavjee. They wrote that next steps include pipe repair and pest control efforts.
“With a handful of unknowns, it is difficult to estimate the duration of the Dining Hall’s closure,” they wrote, adding that they expect the dining hall will not reopen before the week’s end.
Becerra and Keshavjee wrote that Adams’s student-faculty dinner, which is scheduled for this week, has been moved from the Adams Lower Common Room to the newly renovated Claverly Hall. Adams Library is also closed for the duration of the repairs.
“This is very disappointing news,” they wrote. “While we are grateful that we are able to use neighboring Dining Halls for the time being, we are all eager to be back together in our own spaces.”
Some Adams residents said the infestation has extended to their dorm rooms and disrupted their meal schedules.
Nicholas C. della Cava ’24, who lives near the Adams dining hall, said fruit flies have infiltrated his room “all over the place.”
“They’re really tenacious,” della Cava said. “They go for your skin and they’re drawn to you and they’ll keep going back to the same source.”
“I’m too afraid to go after them,” he added. “At this point, I’m just kind of ignoring them.”
Adams resident Abigail A. Golden ’24 said student displacement created by the closing has “killed the community” in Adams.
“I don’t think anyone comes in here if they don’t live here anymore,” Golden said.
Though Cindy Gao ’22 said she acknowledges that the closure is an inconvenience for Adams residents like herself, she believes the trek to other houses’ dining halls is not “that big of a deal.”
“It can be a very Harvard thing — if something’s gonna take two extra minutes — to freak out about it,” Gao said.
Alexandria T.Q. Ho ’24, who said her dorm room has been overrun by flies, wrote in a text message that she is “very upset” about the experience.
“It’s been going on for more than a week now and so far, we have to deal with this on our own,” wrote Ho, who is also a Crimson Blog editor. “We had to buy fly traps from Amazon to catch the flies.”
Ho added that she has had to discard food because flies got into her suite’s mini fridges, despite them being shut.
“We got an inspector last week after we submitted a working order but the inspector only told us to clean better and throw out trash daily,” Ho wrote. “We’ve been doing that and the situation hasn’t gotten any better.”

The Institute of Politics hosted its second-ever “Day of Civic Action” on Tuesday in an effort to bolster civic participation among students at the College.
Scheduled on Election Day, the day’s events included an “Action Hub” promoting civic engagement, a crash course on American politics called “American Politics 101,” and an election night watch party.
IOP vice president Kevin L. Ballen ’22 said the IOP’s goal for the “Day of Civic Action” was to create “civic pathways” for students year round.
“Consistent civic engagement, knowing who your senators and representatives are, being in touch with them, thinking about the issues that are important to you, and speaking up and advocating is really our hope,” Ballen said.
Student organizer Luis F. Esteva Sueiro ’24 said the goal of the Action Hub – where IOP volunteers positioned at the Science Center Plaza encouraged students to sign petitions, volunteer for campaigns, and vote – was to allow as many students as possible to participate, even if they could only spare a few minutes.
“Everyone's grinding – it’s November,” Esteva Sueiro said. “We just wanted to see if we could get a lot of students to take one small action that could then aggregate to something big.”
Attendee Jenna S. Albezreh ’23 said the Action Hub enabled students to understand that civic engagement does not have to be hard.
“Oftentimes we think it's really difficult, but then it's just like a click or a sign or a call, which is so easy,” Albezreh said.
Carter G. Demaray ’25, another participant, said he believed the Action Hub specifically helped engage students in local elections.
“We do have elections happening in the Boston area, so it's really good to see that people are energized, engaged and trying to get other students engaged in the process,” he said.
For the “American Politics 101” workshop in Emerson Hall, students rotated across five rooms, each of which focused on different aspects of American government, including the three branches of the federal government and the country’s two-party system.
Imaan Mirza ’25, an organizer of the workshop, said her experiences growing up in Saudi Arabia sparked her interest in civic engagement among young adults.
“I grew up in Saudi Arabia where there weren’t any mediums or channels through which you could be civically engaged, and so as a young person here, I feel very fortunate to have those channels and means to express my political views, my ideas, my values,” Mirza said. “As young people the onus really does fall on us to exercise all of the avenues of civic engagement that we can.”
Jay Hong Chew ’25, another organizer, added that the workshop was also meant to provide a foundation for international students with an interest in American politics.
“When we talk about politics, perhaps we have neglected the international student population that is interested in American politics but doesn’t have a base,” Chew said. “Without a foundational theoretical base, how much can you understand?”
At the 7:30 p.m. watch party in the Kirkland House Junior Common Room, participants watched the day’s election results – including the Virginia gubernatorial race – over chicken fingers and fries.
Demaray, who attended the watch party as well as the Action Hub, said he enjoyed meeting other students with a “shared nerdiness” for politics while waiting for election results.
Outside of the three main events, the IOP collaborated with the Undergraduate Council to provide grants for other organizations to host events focusing on civic engagement.
One of the organizations, the Harvard College Democrats, held an “Election Day Extravaganza” to facilitate phone banking.
Another, Harvard Global Alliance for Medical Innovation, collaborated with Vot-ER, an organization that works to integrate voter registration into the healthcare system, to host a text bank.
At the watch party, Ballen said the participation in the day’s events — attended by over 500 students, according to Ballen — underscores student interest in civic participation.
“There's a lot of potential for energy outside of major elections that we can cultivate,” Ballen said. “I think people are generally excited to take civic action – it just takes an additional step to get them interested.”

Experts discussed protest movements and police repression of protesters in Latin America at a webinar hosted by the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies on Tuesday.
The webinar’s panel — part of the Tuesday Seminar Series hosted by the DRCLAS — included Icesi University assistant professor Juan Albarracín, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile associate professor Loreto Cox, and University of Essex assistant professor Ximena Velasco-Guachalla, who presented their work on Colombia, Chile, and Bolivia, respectively.
Albarracín said that May and June’s protests in Colombia were heavily repressed by the government and — unlike in the past — primarily took place in cities. He also said more young people participated in the protests.
“What is also particularly interesting about this new wave of contention is not only that it's occurring in an urban setting in Colombia, but that we have a new and more diverse set of actors that are participating in these forms of collective action,” he said.
Participants in the Chilean protests in Oct. 2019 were also composed predominantly of young people, Cox said.
“Protesters tend to be young and educated. They do not come disproportionately from the less well-off in any sense,” she said. “They are high-frequency users of social media, they are interested in politics, and they strongly identify with the left.”
Cox also said through her research she has found almost nonexistent support among protesters for use of force by police. She said there is a “very strong perception [among protestors] that the police abused human rights always or almost always.”
Cox said she surveyed protestors and those opposing, supporting, and indifferent to the protests and found that the groups varied significantly in their opinions on police use of force against protestors.
“The differences that we find by groups in the propensity to justify the use of violence by citizens and the police are enormous, much greater than those we found in other dimensions of ideology,” Cox said.
Bolivia’s protests that began in Nov. 2019 exemplified the high level of mobilization within the country, Velasco-Guachalla said. She added that the protests were “pretty much a daily occurrence” even throughout Bolivia’s strict Covid-19 lockdowns.
“What perhaps makes Bolivia a little bit of an interesting case is the intensity and the frequency with which people actually go to protest, despite having, in theory, one of the most restrictive lockdowns in the region,” she said.
Following the presentations, Yanilda Gonzalez, assistant professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, synthesized the speakers’ points and said she has witnessed a shift in language used to describe the protests.
“One thing that I find really striking about the three presentations, and I think more broadly in terms of how we have been talking about protests in the last few years of Latin America, is the contrast in the kind of older literature in Latin American politics that’s looked at protests as destabilizing,” she said. “One thing that I’m seeing in the way that we’ve been talking about this wave of protests, is really the way that it can be a possible space for democratic opening.”
Following the discussion, Steven Levitsky, Government professor and director of the DRCLAS, moderated a 30-minute question-and-answer session, during which the panelists contemplated the future of protests in Latin America.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Boston City Councilor and Harvard alum Michelle Wu ’07 will become Boston’s 56th mayor, the first woman and person of color elected in the city’s history, following a decisive victory over City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George Tuesday.
Wu defeated Essaibi George by a margin of 63.6 to 36.4 percent, with all precincts reporting. Wu becomes the first Harvard College alum to serve as Mayor of Boston in nearly 100 years, since the 1925 election of Malcolm E. Nichols, Class of 1899, a wealthy Boston Brahmin Republican.
Wu took a commanding lead early in the race, buoyed by endorsements from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other progressive stalwarts, and never let go. She defeated Essaibi George, Acting Mayor Kim Janey, and City Councilor Andrea J. Campbell in September’s preliminary election.
The Wu campaign held an election night event at the Boston Center for the Arts. The night began with a live Latin jazz performance and ended with Queen’s “We Are The Champions” and raining confetti, as Wu took the stage alongside a sea of volunteers shortly after Essaibi George’s concession.
“One of my sons asked me the other night if boys can be elected mayor of Boston,” Wu said. “They have been, and they will again someday, but not tonight.”
Wu, the first woman elected mayor in Boston’s 391-year history, said the city is ready to “become a Boston for everyone,” welcoming “all who call our city home.”
“Boston is ready to become a Green New Deal city,” Wu said. “We are the city of the first public school in the country, the first public park, the first subway tunnel in the country. We’re the city of revolution.”
“Today, together, we are marching into Boston’s promise,” she added.
Wu campaigned on the promise of a Green New Deal for Boston and will now seek to implement it as mayor. Released by Wu in August 2020, her plan for a Green New Deal aims to “mitigate the threat of climate change, attack poverty and economic inequality, close the wealth gap, and dismantle structural racism.”
At Tuesday’s event, Michele A. Brooks, a volunteer on the Wu campaign and a member of the Sierra Club, called Wu a “climate justice champion,” and said she believes Wu will achieve a Green New Deal for Boston.
“Everything that I have heard Michelle commit to get done, she gets done,” Brooks said. “That’s another reason why I was so excited to volunteer for her, because I trust her.”
“I think it signifies a real shift in the kind of city that we want to be, and that is — like Michelle’s message — a city for everyone, inclusive, equitable, and just city that is welcoming to people of all races, of all genders, of all different backgrounds,” Brooks added.
Helen Li, another volunteer with the campaign, brought her two daughters to the event to see Wu’s victory in person.
“It’s very important to teach future generations that we have to be in charge of our choice,” Li said. “Otherwise, it will be chosen for us.”
Li, a daughter of immigrants, said she hopes her children see “a piece of them” in the Wu administration.
“They will, I think, feel less afraid in the future to see themselves in the spotlight,” Li said. “They will hopefully be encouraged to speak up for the voiceless.”
Wu thanked Essaibi George as well as Janey — who became the first woman and person of color to serve as Boston’s mayor in March — crediting the latter with “blazing this trail.”
In her concession speech, Essaibi George congratulated Wu on her historic election.
“I know this is no small feat. You know this is no small feat,” Essaibi George said. “I want her to show this city how mothers get it done.”
Wu, who will take office on Nov. 16, said she would be working closely with Janey’s administration over the coming weeks to ensure a smooth transition.
“Although we’ve put in a lot of work to get to this day, our movement does not end here. We have a lot of work to do,” Wu said. “Let’s celebrate tonight, and tomorrow, continue to work together.”

At 1:06 a.m. Wednesday morning — more than five hours after the polls closed in Cambridge — the city’s election commission announced the results of the city council election: seven incumbents would keep their seats and two challengers would join them.
The preliminary results showed Burhan Azeem and Paul F. Toner will become councilors after finishing among the top nine vote-getters, while first-term councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler did not win reelection.
The seven remaining seats were filled by incumbents Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, Councilor Alanna M. Mallon, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, and Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan, per the unofficial results. The other incumbent, Timothy J. Toomey, did not seek another term.
All three measures included in this year’s ballot — which called for amendments to the city’s Plan E Charter — were also passed, according to preliminary results. The tally showed a majority of Cambridge voters support an annual review of the city manager’s performance, allocating the council power to approve city manager appointments, and a regular review of the city charter every 10 years by the council.
Siddiqui received the most first-ranked votes of any candidate in the preliminary count, which she had also accomplished in 2019.
With 20,253 votes, this year’s turnout was almost identical to the last election in 2019. This year, residents could vote by mail, early in person from Oct. 23 through Oct. 29, or in person on election day.
Mallon, who was elected as Vice Mayor in 2019, said she was “surprised” by the low turnout, given that there were a variety of voting options due to the pandemic.
“I think Covid taught us over the last few years that local municipal government is really incredibly, incredibly critical,” she said. “These are the folks that are making decisions on public health decisions.”
Despite the overall low voter turnout, some citizens acknowledged their responsibility to engage in local elections.
“I've been coming out for decades, every election; I've never missed one,” Cantabrigian Elizabeth Van Ranst said. “I feel it's my obligation as a citizen, as a resident, and because I want to have a voice.”
Resident Ben E. Wright said that housing was “absolutely the number one issue” for renters and property owners alike.
“If you own your house, the issue is the rising property taxes,” he said. “If you rent, the issue is the rent’s increasing to the point where people are considering having to move out: having to move to Medford, having to move to Malden, move further out of the city and away from their jobs and away from the community that they love.”
Affordable housing has been a major issue for both the incumbent candidates and challengers going into this election.
Andrew R. King — a long-time Cambridge resident — said affordable housing was the most important issue for him when voting this year.
“There’s been so much displacement with the luxury high-rise developments and gentrification,” King said. “People like me who grew up here can’t afford to live here anymore.”
Joe McGuirk, a first-time candidate who did not secure a seat, said he was nonetheless happy with how his campaign went.
“It's been a victory for lower income folks, renters, and working folks,” McGuirk said. “​​I've brought up some issues and we're pumped to continue advocating for some of those voices.”
The newly elected council will convene to elect the mayor and vice mayor from among themselves once they take office at the inaugural meeting in Jan. 2022.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July of 2021, senior outside attacker Julia Beckmann was faced with an extremely challenging set of circumstances. After being elected captain of the Harvard women’s volleyball program in January, Beckmann had previously had an operation performed on her shoulder to repair her long-time torn labrum. This, coupled with not being able to participate in physical therapy post-surgery due to Covid-19 restrictions, left the senior studying economics and psychology in a considerable amount of pain when playing the game she loves. Due to the pain in her shoulder as well as an injury to her knees from overuse, she was forced to stop playing the game that has been such a big part of her life for so long.
“I almost felt like the decision was kind of made for me,” Beckmann said. “I did everything I could for my shoulder and pretty much exhausted my resources.”
But that did not stop Beckmann from making an impact on the game she loved. She decided to stay on as co-captain of the team despite being medically retired.
“I already knew there's no way I want to leave my team,” Beckmann said. “I've spent so much time with them, and they've been the heart and soul of my time at Harvard, so I wanted to be as involved as humanly possible.”
Tasked with transitioning from an on-court leader to a primarily off-court one, Beckmann had a new kind of challenge on her hands. However, head coach of the Crimson women’s volleyball squad Jennifer Weiss knew Beckmann would step up to the plate.
“It takes a special person to be able to adapt into that role, and I think she’s just done a tremendous job with it and is well respected by her peers, so she’s doing a great job,” Weiss said.
When the Student Athletic Advisory Committee (SAAC) member Beckmann knew she had to tell Weiss about medically retiring from the game she loves, she was admittedly nervous. However, Weiss’s response was everything Beckmann had hoped for and more.
“I am so appreciative of her response,” Beckmann said. “She [Weiss] said, ‘What does this mean for you life-wise?’ She really cares about us as individuals.”
Beckmann, who also serves as chief marketing officer (CMO) for the women’s volleyball program, told her team about her medical retirement when she returned to campus in the fall. The team’s response was no different than Weiss’s.
“They were all crazy supportive and understanding and treated me absolutely no different,” Beckmann added. “I couldn't be more grateful for everyone's reaction and response to it.”
The co-captain earning a citation in Spanish had tried many different sports growing up, including basketball, soccer, swimming, and even archery. None of these stuck, but at the age of 12, volleyball did.
After her first volleyball tryout, Beckmann turned to her parents and said “Mom, Dad, this is the sport for me.”
Soon after, Beckmann dropped her other sports and devoted all of her time and energy to volleyball. In just the seventh grade, she piqued the interest of the varsity volleyball coach at her high school in Garden City, N.Y. Having never been done before, pulling the then middle schooler Beckmann up to play with the high schoolers was quite the challenge. To do so, the coach had to jump through many hoops with the athletic department, and Beckmann even had to perform various physical activities to prove that she was able to compete safely with older players, including both running a mile and holding a pull-up for 30 seconds among others.
In her six-year tenure on the varsity program in Garden City, Beckmann was captain for three years — an experience she draws on now as a captain for the Crimson volleyball squad.
“I think that helped maturity and learning-wise hugely for me because I was leading players that were older than me, but I think it gave me a lot of confidence in my abilities,” Beckmann said. “I think you just mentally become a much stronger player when you have people relying on you.”
However, at Harvard, Beckmann has not always had a role similar to the one she held in high school. She has struggled with injuries throughout her career for the Crimson, and this adversity left her in a more supportive role on the squad than she had previously.
“I had never really sat [on] the bench before,” the Pforzheimer House resident said. “But I'm really grateful for that time because I think I learned a ton.”
Similar to Beckmann, junior co-captain Jaimie Rao has served in various roles during her time on the women’s volleyball team. In Rao's first year on the squad, she did not see a lot of game action to start. The duo’s experience in serving different roles has prepared them not only for captaincy but also for navigating the unique position they are in now in leading their team with Beckmann being medically retired.
“I feel like it’s a really great perspective to have because I just remember what it’s like to be a freshman and be terrified,” Rao said. “When I became captain, my goal was to make everyone feel welcome, everyone feel valued, and to remind everyone that we’re doing this for fun.”
The Crimson is going to need every bit of experience that Beckmann and Rao have to offer this year. Like many Ivy League teams, almost half of the squad is new to the program. The adjustment coming from high school and club teams to college is a challenging one for most, so the team draws on Beckmann and Rao’s experience to help ease that transition.
With the daunting task of leading a program of women, half of whom has never played a college volleyball game before this season, Rao and Beckmann both approach leading their team in a similar way.
“We really value having a team that’s positive and confident,” Rao said. “We really don’t stand for any negativity.”
Beckmann is on the same page as Rao.
“We really want our team to just have more fun and just enjoy the sport more,” Beckmann said. “I think we've both upheld that and really kind of made it happen.”
Leading a consistently Ivy-League-championship-contending squad of women is a lot of responsibility. Nonetheless, Rao and Beckmann have found a way to distribute the expectations of captaincy given their circumstances.
“I think I kind of do a little bit of the day-to-day encouragement and leading the team as we’re competing to play the best that we can while Julia is more in charge of overall attitude, overall happiness, logistics, making sure everyone is on time,” Rao said. “She has the bigger picture stuff.”
Beckmann helps take on different responsibilities than Rao on game days as well. When Rao is preparing herself to perform, Beckmann makes sure everyone has what they need to be their best as well. She reminds everyone when the coaches will come to speak to the team and when they need to warm up for the game. She records various statistics, and she manages any logistical issues that may occur on game days.
“[Beckmann] does all the little things that bring success to any program or any group,” Weiss said.
Beckmann is also able to see things, similar to coaches, that Rao is not able to see when playing. Beckmann acts as a line of direct communication between the coaches and her teammates in helping them succeed on a broader scale than a play-by-play approach.
“She [Rao] has the on-court perspective, I have the off-court perspective,” Beckmann added. “We really just kind of help each other out.”
The captain election process for Harvard athletics is completely peer-based — coaches or administrators cannot tip the scales. When someone is chosen to lead the program, a lot of thought and deliberation inform the decision. For Beckmann, being elected captain was an extreme honor.
“It showed to me that the team really thought I was a good person that could lead and that had a good relationship with the coaches, that had a good relationship with individual teammates, and was someone they could kind of trust and rely on,” Beckmann said. “It's just the biggest compliment.”
While leading as a medical retiree is an adjustment for Beckmann, she had some inspiration to draw from in Michaela Dews ’17. Dews also was elected captain and had to medically retire under Weiss’s time as head coach of the Crimson. Dews took on the challenge of staying on as captain under unique circumstances, and knowing that someone else has done it has helped Beckmann in her role as co-captain.
“I kind of have used Michaela as my role model almost,” the Student-Athlete Wellness Leader (SAWL) said.
Head coach of the women’s volleyball program Jennifer Weiss knew that Julia, drawing on Dew’s experience, was up for the task.
“Not everyone has the mentality that Michaela and Julia have and the maturity to step away but still lead and be positive,” Weiss said. “I knew in Julia that I could trust and we would have mutual respect for one another so that she could be in that role.”
The Harvard women’s volleyball program, under the leadership of Beckmann and Rao, is currently fourth in the Ivy League standings.
“Our team is performing, and she’s [Beckmann] adding to that with her maturity and her experience and her knowledge of the game but also her maturity and being a great leader,” Weiss said.
While the team continues to pursue excellence this season, Beckmann’s final season of volleyball probably is not what she pictured when she was that 12-year-old playing with the varsity team, but she is proud to lead her team in any way she can.
“I think it's really exciting,” Beckmann said. “It's awesome to be a part of, and I definitely wouldn't change it for the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The men’s water polo team continued its successful season Oct. 22-24 at the Julian Fraser Memorial Tournament, bringing its win-loss total to 20-3. The weekend began with decisive 24-9 and 13-9 victories against Fresno Pacific University (6-20, 2-5 Pacific West) and No. 18 California Baptist University (16-13, 4-2 WWPA) respectively, followed by a narrow 13-12 triumph over Santa Clara University (10-9-1, 2-3), and finished with a close 13-10 loss against No. 7 UC Santa Barbara (19-8, 1-2 Big West).
“I thought we played well, even in the loss against Santa Barbara,” head coach Ted Minnis said. “[The weekend] was a really good springboard, getting us prepared for these last six conference games before we go into postseason.”
For Minnis and the 14 team members who call California home, the Julian Fraser Memorial Tournament was more than just an opportunity to play high-level water polo. Players noted that they were incredibly thankful to feel the support of friends and former teammates at their games and enjoyed the chance to reconnect with family members.
The Crimson started off strong with a decisive 15 point win over Fresno Pacific (5-16, 2-3 WWPA). Offensive players had a great run, with junior attacker Alex Tsotadze and sophomore center Kaleb Archer scoring four and five goals, respectively. The impressive 24-goal game marked a season high for the Crimson as well.
Harvard found success on the second day of competition as well, tallying two additional wins Against California Baptist, Tsotadze and sophomore attacker Owen Hale scored three goals each, and junior goalie Noah Hodge had a fantastic second half of the game, saving 10 of California Baptist’s 12 shots. The second victory of the day, over Santa Clara University, was Harvard’s 10th consecutive win and 20th win of the season.
The streak came to an end as the Crimson faced off against No. 7 UC Santa Barbara, the highest-ranked team it has competed against thus far in the season. Despite finishing the weekend with a loss, Minnis and players alike were pleased with the level of play.
“We played a great game against a great team and proved to ourselves that we can play at a really high level,” Tsotadze said. “Even though we weren’t able to come out on top against Santa Barbara, it made us believe in what we have been saying all year – that we can compete with anyone in the country.”
Tsotadze also noted that Harvard suffered a lapse in the third quarter that saw the squad fall to an 8-4 deficit, and Santa Barbara’s consistency ultimately made a comeback too difficult.
“When you play a team like that, they’re going to capitalize on your mistakes, and I think we had some breakdowns defensively that they capitalized on,” Minnis said. “We've gotten away with making those mistakes against other teams, [but] we didn’t get away with it against Santa Barbara.”
As the season wraps up, the team is focusing on the remaining games before the postseason. With just under three weeks to go before the Northeast Water Polo Conference Tournament, the Crimson will look to refine its play and continue to improve upon its national ranking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The top floor of the Malkin Athletic Center erupted in cheers from students and parents alike as sophomore hitter Ashley Wang delivered a kill to clinch the fourth set for the Crimson (9-10, 6-4 Ivy League) in Saturday’s match against the University of Pennsylvania (6-13, 3-7). The Quakers had cruised through the first two sets, but Harvard clawed its way back in the third and fourth to send the match into a decider. Despite saving five match points, the Crimson could not turn the corner and lost the fifth set 18-16.
“We really focused on key points and used those to win the third and fourth sets,” Wang said.
This weekend’s double-header was Wang’s first time back on the court after she went down with an ankle injury in Harvard’s first Ivy match against Penn on Oct. 1. Nevertheless, Wang picked up where she left off, providing invaluable assistance to the Crimson offense with 14 kills on the night and six in the previous game against Princeton.
“I’m really excited to get back out [on the court] and be with my team,” Wang said. “It’s definitely been a process; I was out for half of conference-play. By watching my team off the court, I learned a lot from this new perspective.”
Wang drew silver linings from her injury and those suffered by other players throughout the season.
“We've definitely grown a lot of depth in our team, as we’ve been through injuries and adversity,” Wang said. “We’ve all grown together, have connected really well, and we can count on anyone to step up and play on any day.”
Perhaps this chemistry explains the team’s turnaround despite dropping the first two sets. The third set saw Harvard take an early lead, and the team was able to continue this gap, crossing over the halfway point at a score of 13-8. A series of kills to the back right corner gave Penn chances to make its way back into the set. Despite having the momentum, the Quakers were foiled by their own service errors, and from the opposite side of the net kills by sophomore outside hitter Nicole Prescott and junior attacker and co-captain Jaimie Rao. The former had 11 kills in the match and the latter had 10. Toward the end of the set, this duo sent the Crimson on a run that reopened the gap and sealed the set 25-17.
Harvard did not let the five-minute break between sets erode its momentum.
As play resumed, three service aces from Prescott and more Quaker errors allowed the Crimson to open up the fourth set with a 6-0 shutout. Kills by Rao and sophomore outside hitter Katie Vorhies, who also had 10 kills against the Quakers, extended the lead to 9-1 before Penn could regroup. Although from there Penn went on a five-point run, Harvard was in control for the rest of the set. The teams traded blocks, kills, and service errors, and each went on two- or three-point runs before the Crimson crossed the 25-point line, eight points ahead of the Quakers, to clinch the fourth set and force a fifth.
As has often been the case this season, Harvard was forced to play from behind. A slow start from the team allowed Penn to easily take the first two sets and forced the Crimson to elevate its level during the third and fourth.
“Tonight, we didn’t come out that strong,” Rao said. “[We were] a bit on our heels. I think we were nervous, and it’s easy when another team is making a run to get a little frantic and almost hope the ball doesn’t come to you. That’s when you’re standing up a little high, and you’re on your heels, so we couldn’t make those killer plays.”
Penn dominated the first two sets as it went on more frequent runs, and the team was also aided by Harvard’s poor ball control and service errors. The match started in gridlock, and the Crimson drew first blood by gaining a two-point lead early. Penn, however, went on a five-point run throughout the middle of the set to go up 15-11. This momentum was propelled by junior outside hitters Autumn Leak and Madeline McGregor. The Quakers would hold the lead provided by their hitters and win the first set 25-18.
The second set went the same way as the fourth, but this time it was Penn that took an early lead. Although Harvard managed to tie it up in the middle of the set, aided by crucial kills from Wang, the Quakers pulled away and took the second set 25-17.
Harvard took its momentum from the third and fourth set into the deciding rush to 15 points. It won the first three points, but Penn countered with a three-point run of its own to keep the fifth set in gridlock. The back-and-forth continued all the way until 11-11 when two kills by Leak and an error from Rao gave the Quakers three match points. With its back against the wall, the Crimson managed to fend off defeat on five different occasions, but finally, the team fell to a kill from McGregor in extra points, 18-16.
On Friday, however, Harvard avenged its 3-2 loss to Princeton earlier in the season, sweeping the Tigers for its first straight-set win of the year. Although the sets were close, with a final score of 25-23, 25-21, and 25-20, 14 kills from Rao and 10 from Vorhies enabled a quick victory for the Crimson. Sophomore and first-year setters Bella Almanza and Rocky Aguirre posted 23 and 16 assists, respectively: a testament to the team chemistry and improvement from its performance in the 2019 season. Wang noted she is excited to bring that into the rest of the season, the spring, and next year.
“We’re looking to go out on a high,” Rao said. “We want to treat every game like it's a championship game because [who knows] what's going to happen in the Ivy League. We're still a contender. We're still one of the top teams, but anyone can beat anyone, so we know we can't take anything lightly. We have to treat every game like it's the most important game we're going to play.”
With only four more regular-season games within the next two weeks, Rao noted a shift in the team’s mentality to be less timid and to have a killer instinct. The team hopes to work on its consistency and to come out to matches firing, rather than having to play from behind.

Our vocabulary on campus has changed quite a bit since before the pandemic. For better or for worse, here are some of the new things we say these days that were never really a thing before.
On Class Years
“I’m a social junior!”
Look, I know you’re sick of hearing this. AND I’M SORRY these four words have become a part of my daily vocabulary. Can you blame me, though? I can’t say I’m ~really~ a junior because that’s basically telling people “Hey! I’m more than halfway through college!” and we definitely can’t have that — I’m far from being a real adult. My mind is youthful. My possibilities are endless. So I’m telling myself.
“Okay, fair. So why don’t you just say you’re a sophomore then?” 
Because I am a sOciAL junioR!! I am not officially in the Class of 2024. I was here before the pandemic. I don’t need directions to Sanders Theater. Yeah, I’ve been to Pfoho Igloo. I am super cool.
On Public Health
“Oops, I forgot to do my Covid test.”
You miss your mom. You miss the shuttle to class. You miss your Covid-19 test every week and now Color harasses you like the Duolingo Owl. You don’t remember the last time you were up-to-date with your testing schedule (because you never were). Get it together, man. Call your mom. Stop using the app and be better at guessing when the shuttle arrives. Shove that plastic swab in your nose. Sneeze five times. Submit your Covid-19 test.
I know that being a Harvard student didn't always involve a biweekly Covid-19 test. I know you could roll up to your midterm cocooned in a blanket with an entire Kleenex box, blow your nose loudly in the back, and not have your classmates wonder “Is this midterm really testing my knowledge of macroeconomics or the strength of my Covid-19 vaccine?”
Being a sOciAL jUnioR, I, too, remember the way things were. But things have changed. So do your Covid-19 test and don’t go to your midterm in a sickness cocoon.
On Dhall Meals
“I’m grabbing a to-go container from the dhall.”
Remember the days before the plastic to-go containers? The bring-your-own-tupperware days? The how-many-disposable-coffee-cups-filled-with-food-can-I-stack days? I do. So thank you, to-go containers. Thank you for making it possible to leave the dhall with my food as often as I want — zero judgment.
We don’t love that it took a whole a** pandemic for to-go containers to become available. But, hey, it’s finally normal to walk out of the dhall with a mountain of tater tots, and I’m here for it.
On Fashion and Section Crushes
“Cool mask.”
It’s 2019. You missed the shuttle. You got rained on. You’re late to class and there are no seats left — except one, next to your section crush. You make eye contact and sit down quickly, trying to forget that you look like a wet squirrel. “Take notes,” you tell yourself. You try to look cool and studious, but it backfires. You drop your pencil. “This can’t get any worse,” you think. And then, as you bend down to pick up your pencil and you see a glimmer of hope — your crush’s Yeezys. W o w. Your heart starts racing. Can this person get any cooler? You lean over and whisper “cool shoes.” And it works. It’s a match made in heaven. You spend the rest of your lives together.
It’s 2021. It didn’t work out with Yeezy man. You missed the shuttle (again). You got rained on (again). You’re late to class and there are no seats left — except one, next to your section crush (again). You make eye contact and sit down quickly, trying to forget that you look like a wet squirrel (again). But you notice their mask — it’s not a blue surgical mask. It’s a cloth mask with stars and stripes. “Stars and stripes,” you think, “where have I seen that before?” You can no longer remember, but it doesn’t matter, because the only star that matters is your crush. They’re glowing. You lean over and whisper, “Cool mask.” And it works. It’s a match made in heaven. You spend the rest of your lives together.
Tl;dr: I have a theory that complimenting someone on their non-mainstream mask is a great way to make conversation that wasn’t an option before the pandemic. Try it sometime and let me know how it goes.
I can’t really decide how I feel about a lot of things we say these days. I’m currently looking for a less annoying alternative to “sOciAL jUniOr,” so let me know if you’ve got one. But otherwise, it looks like most of this new stuff is here to stay.

To all the campus food I’ve loved before,
It was a long year away from Harvard and the comfort of HUDS’ finest cuisine for those of us here pre-March 2020. Coming back to campus, we didn’t expect to find college just as we left it: we’ve grown up from freshmen in Annenberg to sophomores/juniors/in-betweeners facing thesis planning and punch. But who could have guessed the HUDS-shaped hole in our hearts would never heal just right? If you, too, stare nostalgically at your dhall tray – reminiscing the meals that once were and those that failed to outlive the pandemic — take a trip down memory lane with us as we memorialize our favorites.
Bistro Bowls
If you never knew HUDS food could be fancy, you’ve clearly never seen a bistro bowl. Steak poutine? Chicken tandoori? Yes, please. Back in the olden days, young freshmen, burgers from the grill were not the only way to get a break from Red’s very frequent Best Catch. We miss you, bistro bowls.
Tomato Basil Raviolini 
All tomato soup is not made equal. Peak dhall soup consists of a creamy tomato-basil blend riddled with miniature stuffed pockets of pasta. This is entirely different from mostly-blended, chunky bits of tomato: That’s called marinara sauce and belongs to a whole other food group. We love you, HUDS, but please give us back our glorified Chef Boyardee.
Mozz Sticks
Technically, these came from the beloved House grilles, and technically, they should return soon with the Quad Grille’s impending resurrection. Still, it’s been tragically too long without the greasy crunch of fried cheese, and we must educate the younger generations. Be prepared to blow through your BoardPlus at an alarming rate as soon as these babies reappear. Lactose intolerant who?
Vegan Chili 
Does anybody else on campus miss the warm, chunky, mushroom-vegetable medley that was HUDS vegan chili? Probably not. But dear HUDS, if you’re hearing this, there’s at least one mega fan out here, and quinoa sweet potato chili just does not compare.
Border Café
This is in no way, shape, or form related to Harvard University Dining Services, but our hearts were broken (and still are) by this staggering loss. Sure, we still have Felipe’s and we’ll always have Jefe’s. But Border Café, our love for you burns brighter than the fire that closed your doors.
It’s crazy to think about how half of our campus never got the chance to know these culinary treasures. Maybe we gained ricotta squares, but we lost time-tested favorites along the way. Rest in peace, all our HUDS classics. We’ll never forget you.

Thinking about how a whole generation of Harvard undergrads don’t know what the Pfoho Igloo, Belltower, Mather JCR, Lev G-Hutch, or Cabot Aquarium are makes me a bit sad, really. These places have been relegated to the same fate that LamCaf and Barker Cafe share: freshmen and academic sophomores have no idea what we — the people who were on campus for at least a semester before all hell broke loose — mean when we refer to the former hot-spots.
Long gone are the days when you’d ask your entryway mates where they’re going this weekend and they’d tell you Mather JCR — a (literal) steamy cube of a party space always sure to be blasting music as you walk past. The Aquarium in Cabot used to be the place to be on a Friday night, with lines going out the door and a stampede of people trying to get in. But, as with the many cafes and events that we’ve lost this semester (R.I.P. Crimson Jam and B.o.B.), these party spaces are added to the list. The loss of inclusive, on-campus party spots make it that much harder for freshmen students to find their communities. While keeping in mind Covid is very much still a thing, we can’t ignore that parties are still happening — they just are not happening at these iconic (freshmen) spaces.
I fondly talk about the good ol’ days of trying to navigate the Quad shuttle or find my way through the Cambridge Commons, searching for “Cabot House” or “Pforzheimer” in Google Maps. Though as a Quadling I’ve now become fully acquainted with the (short) walk from the Yard to the Quad, I remember the days of putting in “Mather JCR” into my Google Maps, getting lost, somehow ending up at Pfoho, trying to go home, and then ending up BACK at Mather.
I almost miss the sound of the Quad shuttle dropping off gaggles of excited and boisterous freshmen every weekend. They may have not known where the Igloo was and would be running around the maze that is the Pfoho basement, but it always made me nostalgic to see these ever-eager youngins roaming campus at 9:30 p.m. every Friday night.
But maybe I’m just sugarcoating it here, and some nights the *very loud* energy of the freshmen just served as a reminder that even as a then-sophomore (and current senior), I had lost that naïveté and was a bit jaded. And maybe all the Aquarium parties wouldn’t serve as a pivotal scene in a coming-of-age movie, but, let’s be honest – who doesn’t miss the tried-and-true treks to the Quad that you could always count on for a fun time? Whether it was a party hosted by Model UN or a random club that you’d never heard of but your roommate swore they had a friend in Expos who told them it would be fun…these cringe worthy memories were baked into the transformative Harvard experience.
The Igloo may now be housing extra furniture and storage instead of packed and sweaty freshmen, but the sentiment still remains. We’ll dust off the cobwebs and return to the dance floor soon. Cheers to the mostly good, mostly memorable, and sometimes downright not great (but it’s for the plot!) times we’ve had.

Spooky season's over, and gratitude season is here! Since autumn is in full swing now, there's no better time to fall back in love with Harvard after a year away. This week, we're remembering our favorite things about campus, appreciating the little things, and looking forward to whatever "new normal" means.
