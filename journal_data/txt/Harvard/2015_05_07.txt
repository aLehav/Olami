After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard sports arena transformed into a runway on April 25 for the 21st anniversary of Eleganza. Backflips, maxi dresses, and hip-hop music filled the Lavietes Pavilion in an event that sought to be more than just a high-energy production. Both behind-the-scenes and on-stage, Eleganza was ultimately a display of the organization’s three pillars: fashion, charity, and diversity.
Development of this year’s show began in late April of last year after Preeti V. Srinivasan ’16, Nancy T. Liu ’16, and Haylee A. Smith ’17 were named executive producers. According to Liu, the three spent the summer preparing for model auditions and board interviews, among other aspects of production. In the months leading up to the show, the team communicated with different businesses to secure financial sponsorships. They also reached out to name brands like American Apparel and independent designers like Reyna Lay for the styles that would eventually clothe their models.
To make the necessary preparations, the organization had to coordinate across six different boards. “We had 91 board members and models, and you had to learn to work with different types of people in different situations,” Smith says. “You want to make a team that works well together.”
Their year-long efforts culminated in the creation of three scenes centering around the theme of Pandora’s Box, inspired by the Greek myth of Epimetheus (Kashif K. Fulton ’15) and Pandora (Schuyler C. Moore ’15). In addition to its mythological themes, the show also featured guest performances, including a spoken word piece from Zuri, a teenager from the Boston Center for Teen Empowerment. Every act contributed to a production that, for many of the performers and board members, immediately drew them into the organization when they first saw the show as an audience member: Fulton, in fact, cites Eleganza as one of the reasons he committed to Harvard. “I felt…Harvard kids could definitely let their hair down and have some fun,” he says.
Eleganza’s effects extend farther than the confines of Harvard; all proceeds go to the Center for Teen Empowerment, and this year the community service board made further efforts to engage with the program. According to Liu, Eleganza brought teens from the center to Harvard several times over the course of the year and advised them on the college admissions process. “We want to establish more of a mentorship program…and provide a resource for them beyond donating money to the organization,” Liu says.
The organization’s philanthropy has impacted not only the recipients of its charity but also the members themselves. Srinivasan, Liu, and Smith assert that seeing their work result in something cohesive has been a fulfilling experience. “[Eleganza] really empowers you in that there is a great thing that comes out of all the hard work,” Smith says. “The show itself is incredibly magical for anyone working in it and modeling in it.”
Contributing to this compelling character is Eleganza’s inclusivity. For instance, the show includes performances from the Asian American Dance Troupe, Black Men’s Forum, and Ghungroo. “The best thing about Harvard is its people and the fact that we come from different walks of life,” finance board member and model Jazmine K. Phillips-Acie ’18 says. “[Eleganza is] a great way to celebrate the people of Harvard for being beautiful in our unique ways...and [to celebrate] differences in a separation from the paradigm of beauty.”
This diverse nature further defines the organization’s membership. According to Srinivasan, Eleganza draws on an assorted group of people with different capabilities, from those interested in dance to those concerned with finance and business. “No matter what skill set you bring to the table...there is a place for you within the ’Ganza family,” she says.
Indeed, each executive producer’s introduction to Eleganza reflects this internal diversity. Smith joined for an opportunity to work with fashion in an extracurricular activity; Srinivasan was stunned by Eleganza’s theatrics and wanted to contribute to its production; Liu reached out to work as a makeup artist for the show and ended up becoming community service chair before serving as executive producer.
Such a welcoming environment ultimately creates a meaningful space for members. “The people who do Eleganza are some of my best friends on campus,” Moore says. “You make friendships here that you can’t make anywhere else.”
Smith expresses similar sentiments. “[Eleganza] has made me incredibly confident,” she says. “It brings everyone all over campus together in one room. Eleganza has become the thing that has defined my college career.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 7, 2015, at 4:38 p.m.
More than a hundred students took a break from studying at the strike of midnight on Thursday to ring in the College’s spring final exam period with the biannual tradition of “Primal Scream,” a clothing-optional lap around Harvard Yard.
The streak takes place every semester on the eve of the first day of final exam period. Thursday morning’s relatively warm temperatures, which approached the 60s, may have encouraged more students to take part, although the fall semester’s run generally attracts more participants.
Though most participants wore nothing, some streakers sported accessories to reflect their hometowns or hobbies. A few students took to the Yard proudly bearing the flags of their home states or countries, and at least two students completed the run on wheels with roller skates or skateboards.
Roberto A. Perez ’15, a Primal Scream runner who completed the jog while sporting a Californian flag, said he participated because he wanted to complete the three “things” that College lore suggests students aim to do before graduating.
“It’s my senior spring, and I’ve never done it before,” Perez said. “It’s apparently one of the three things you do before you graduate from Harvard... so it makes sense to do all three.”
As in previous years, the Harvard University Band performed on the sidelines of the run, playing songs including “The Stripper” and “Ridin’ Dirty” in front of the Yard’s John Harvard statue.
Osman G. Siddiqi, a student at the Kennedy School of Government who was one of the many bystanders watching the run, described the spectacle as “fascinating” and “hilarious.” Asked whether he would do something similar himself, he said “maybe.”
“You never know when you are in a group of people what you are going to be willing to do,” he said.
Chanel E. Washington ’15, who completed the tradition in her wheelchair with friends, said it was her “last chance to ever to do something like this” as a senior.
“It’s all about body positivity. I feel great,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s an early Saturday morning. The smell of chlorine fills the air, and swimmers fill the Blodgett Pool. Then, an athlete majestically soars into the air, performs a corkscrew flip, and splashes into the water below. All eyes turn towards the rippling surface of the water in awe.
What has just been witnessed is the diving portion of the Harvard swimming and diving team. Although the two activities are vastly different, they still compete under the same umbrella at the collegiate level. At the national and international level, including the Olympic Games, the sports are split.
Having the two sports together on the same team at younger ages can actually help increase diving participation by exposing aspiring swimmers to diving. This was the case for Crimson swimming and diving co-captain Cassie Corneau.
“I started out doing a summer club swim team, and I had a friend who decided to try diving,” Corneau said. “At first I was terrible, but I kept going. I think the thing that has kept me in it is that it’s always been challenging for me.”
At the NCAA level, there are two main types of diving events: three-meter and one-meter springboard. The names refer to how far above the water the board is positioned.
Diving as a sport is based more on technique than the speed aspect that dominates swimming. Consequently, for Harvard divers, the focus in practice is far different from their swimming counterparts.
“In terms of physical skillset, swimming is an incredibly grueling endurance sport; diving is much more immediate explosiveness,” said Crimson senior diver George Doran. “Mentally, swimming is a long race while diving is a series of two or three-second moves that involve a lot more visualization.”
At Harvard, the swimmers and divers practice together, hang out together, and cheer each other on at competitions, both showing an appreciation for the other contingent’s skill set. The coaches work in conjunction with one another, helping the team build chemistry to flourish at meets.
“They have different disciplines and they train separately, but being able to train at the same time makes them really close,” diving coach Keith Miller said. “The swimmers yell across the pool at the divers; they go across the river and get meals together. They really build a great bond.”
In diving, the goal is to amass as high a point total as possible based on the judges’ scores. Scores are given from a range of one to ten. These totals are then multiplied by the dive’s degree of difficulty, a number corresponding to how challenging a particular dive is to execute.
“There are two parts of diving that really matter: the difficulty of the dive being performed and how the diver executes,” Doran said. “It’s very difficult for casual observers to determine the difficulty of the dive, so it is read aloud. The magnitude of the splash, height of the dive, and distance from the board are all things fans can pick up on.”
Typically for divers, there is a lot of repetition involved trying to perfect their dives and get as prepared as possible for competition.
“We’ll get to the pool, get warmed up, and do some practice on the dry board and trampoline,” Corneau said. “Then we’ll get into the water, work on individual needs, and practice optionals, which are the dives we actually perform at meets.”
Coaches on the swimming and diving team tend to focus on their specific event, but do everything possible to work in tandem with each other to help integrate the squad and foster unity.
“Years ago, there weren’t specialized diving coaches; typically, the swimming coach was also the diving coach,” Miller said. “Keeping on that tradition, swimming coaches and diving coaches still work closely together and are very coordinated.”
One point that is heavily focused on in practice and preparation is the mental aspect of the sport of diving. Being mentally comfortable can make all the difference when it comes to success versus failure.
“Being able to turn your mind off is pretty big,” Corneau said. “A lot of times you could scare yourself, so being able to be trapped in your body and trapped in yourself can help with some of the tougher dives. Mental toughness is extremely important.”
At the end of each meet, the diving results and swimming results are tallied together to jointly determine the team’s standing and crown a champion. On paper, swimming and diving are two sides of the same coin. But, as someone familiar with the sports would tell you, their executions are nowhere near the same plane.
“In diving, it’s still competition and you’re competing against other people,” Miller said. “But in a way you’re also competing against yourself because you’re out there trying to perform the best dive that you can.”
Relay races, freestyles, and breaststrokes aren’t the only requirements to field a solid swimming and diving squad. What happens on the boards is just as important in determining who comes out on top.
