After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crammed together on a boat for the Moonlight Cruise, our Class of 2014 was inescapably close to each other. With Senior Week revelries over and graduation looming near, we feel both pulled together and drawn apart—drawn closer by our last days together, yet feeling the pull of the different paths we’ll take as we scatter across the world.
When our class arrived at Harvard, we hailed from 78 countries and 49 states; we were from everywhere, it seemed, except Wyoming. We spent the first 18 years of our lives living in different states and countries, growing up apart from each other. But we were admitted to complement each other, to contradict each other, to learn from each other’s differences. When we chose to attend Harvard, we made a choice to become close. We committed to each other as much as we did to this institution, and we have grown together as the years passed. Interweaving patterns of apartness and closeness have united our class and solidified our understanding of each other and ourselves.
Though we came to Harvard from the most apart of worlds, within our first week here we learned how much closeness we would encounter. Freshman Week brought us close—in a very physical sense at times. On one of the first weekend nights of college, we wandered into the big Rush Hour 2 dance party in the SOCH to witness countless Harvard students bumping and bobbing—and then were evacuated when our closeness became too much for the glass wall. Later freshman year, as we prepared to enter Harvard’s unique House system, we divided into close blocking groups and dared to partake in an illicit River Run together. Sophomore year, we crowded the dignified Tercentenary Theatre and transformed the lawn into a giant mud pit by dancing in the rain at Harvard’s 375th Anniversary. Junior year, we huddled close in dorm rooms with our friends during Hurricane Sandy as Harvard cancelled classes for the first time in 34 years—and then cancelled classes a few more times for another act of Mother Nature and the Boston Marathon tragedy. Proudly, each year we’ve stormed the field, hopping barriers with our close friends at Harvard-Yale after each of our four consecutive victories at The Game.
Even as Harvard brought us close as a class, it brought out the best and most wonderful differences among us and showed us that apartness should be celebrated, too. Just as Dean Pfister taught us to look at the Yard and its flora with new eyes, we learned to see each other through new and different lenses. Whether shopping for new courses or presenting senior theses, we took pride in our disciplines and concentrations and our different methodologies of thought. We celebrated our heritages, cultural traditions, and backgrounds in spaces both old and new, from Annenberg to Quincy’s Stone Hall and the new Office of BGLTQ Student Life. Our summers and winters saw us crisscross both our campus and the world on exciting projects, jobs, and internships, bringing back ideas and experiences to share with our peers. For four years we have forged separate and diverse paths, even as we have coexisted in the same place.
As a class of builders, thinkers, and challengers, we constantly strove to see apart from the status quo and improve the lives and the communities around us. Against the backdrop of the Arab Spring, Ukraine conflict, and other revolutions, we called for changes closer to home. We were our own sharpest critics, turning a critical eye to issues of fair labor, responsible investment, sexual harassment, and mental health in our community, seeing members of our class rise to action as leaders. We imagined a world apart from what existed, and fought to make this vision come to fruition.
Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve you, 2014. It has been an honor and a joy for us to facilitate moments of closeness and foster old and new friendships from the many remarkable corners of our class. We could not be prouder to represent such an outstanding, inspiring group, and we know this pride will swell as we take on the world.
As we transition into a phase of prolonged physical apartness, the closeness that we created and reveled in here need not fade. Harvard has proved that being apart—in distance and difference—can draw us close. Congratulations, 2014.
With love,
Your 2014 Class Marshals

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 26, 2014, at 9:57 p.m.
In the third paragraph of an email devoted to Pre-Term Planning for Fall 2014, Dean Jay M. Harris informed rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors of a number of “refinements” to the Q guide. “These changes reflect the decisions of the Faculty Council that were intended to make the Q a more accurate, sophisticated, and helpful mechanism for learning about and choosing courses,” he writes.
After a few sentences discussing more innocuous changes to the Q guide, he explains: “The Q form will still ask you to rate the difficulty of the course (and this rating will still be communicated to the course head and instructional support staff), but the “difficulty” score will no longer be publicly displayed.”
A more “accurate, sophisticated, and helpful mechanism,” indeed.
The removal of difficulty ratings from the Q guide is troubling. The way this decision was made—eight months before it was announced, and ostensibly with no input from undergraduates—indicates a serious lack of concern for student opinion. The timidity with which the change was communicated to undergraduates, after the vast majority of those affected by it had left campus, buried near the end of an email on a related but far less controversial topic, suggests a lack of confidence in its legitimacy even among the administration that enacted it. In the wake of the cheating and email search scandals, we find this evidence of continued distrust between students and administrators especially upsetting, albeit unsurprising.
Harvard is attempting to remedy a much more complex issue by attacking a mere symptom of the problem. Harvard’s culture of grade inflation and A-seeking naturally makes grades important; as such, it is unsurprising that students sometimes employ difficulty data in their search for “easy” courses, especially Gen Ed courses that are not especially fulfilling in their own right.
But there are also far less pernicious reasons one might take difficulty ratings into account, for instance, when trying to design a balanced schedule, one that is both challenging and manageable. We find this to be an especially compelling reason on Harvard’s campus, where issues of mental health, stress, and sleep deprivation are particularly pressing.
It seems the University is trying to shift blame for the recent grade inflation debacle onto its students. It must be their fault for enrolling in easy classes and refusing to challenge themselves. But it is the University that must undertake a more serious self-examination if it is to accurately cure what ails it. Denying students valuable information is not the solution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There has been a lot of good conversation on campus this spring on the topic of diversity and community at Harvard. Recent pieces published in The Crimson, the “I, Too, Am Harvard” Tumblr, and face-to-face conversations with undergraduates and our colleagues have had great influence on us and our planning for Opening Days for the Class of 2018.
Those of us who have been around Harvard for a while, or those of us who have participated in Opening Days, know that Community Conversations is the one time, outside the classroom, when all Harvard undergraduates are required to think about identity (meaning our gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, religion, and so on) and how we relate to those around us.
We strongly believe that these conversations ought not be the only time we reflect together on these topics. Talking about who we are and how we fit in together as a community is not easy and takes time. We recognize that a single, 90-minute session during Opening Days is really just the beginning. The beginning, however, is significant and needs our careful attention if what follows is to be meaningful for all.
After several years of feedback from undergraduates we know that Community Conversations has varying impact—some positive, some negative. So, last December, we decided to try to better understand what was happening with Community Conversations by asking all the members of the Class of 2017.
Through that survey, we learned some interesting points—many of which are fairly obvious, but will help improve Community Conversations in the future. First, we must establish a safe environment in order for students to feel comfortable participating, especially when the conversation veers toward the personal. Second, it is important to find ways to draw multiple perspectives into the conversation if these discussions are to lead us to think about what it is like to stand in someone else’s shoes. Third, facilitators must ensure that no one person, or few people, is allowed to dominate the conversation.
It was notable to us that 80 percent of the 1,391 survey respondents “felt that the exercise of Community Conversations was relevant and thought provoking.” Of those in that 80 percent, there is variance by race. For instance, 88 percent of students who identified as foreign nationals and 88 percent of self-identified blacks found Community Conversations “relevant and thought provoking” in comparison to 78 percent of self-identified white students.
The question for us now is: How we can make these conversations equally “relevant and thought provoking” for all students? And, how can we inspire these conversations to happen more often, either in an organic or structured way?
Related to this point, The Crimson reported on March 28 about a town hall meeting held by Latino and Black students. After reading that Community Conversations was one point of discussion at the town hall, we reached out to students quoted in the article to ask if we could hear about their experience and to gather their feedback.
A group of eight undergraduates met with the two of us on April 11 to talk about the goals of Community Conversations, the common readings, concerns about facilitation, and the size and composition of the discussion groups.
The conversation with those students was very helpful to us and we’re grateful for their good ideas, many of which will be implemented this coming fall.
For instance, alongside the packet of readings, members of the Class of 2018 will also receive a glossary of important terms (e.g. preferred gender pronouns, privilege, and so on) as well as a description of diversity-related resources and services at Harvard. We are also expanding our team of facilitators to include administrators and teaching fellows and are hoping to involve more undergraduates as facilitators. Our goal is that teams of facilitators will attend a common training, learning together and developing a shared vision for how to lead their Community Conversation.
This summer, one of the Freshman Dean’s Office’s undergraduate interns will be conducting a benchmarking project to look at how other universities raise the issue of diversity during orientation. We are and will remain committed to celebrating and exploring our diversity, yet we know that there may be other ways to raise our collective consciousness. A report of the findings of this project will be submitted to us in the fall of 2014, and we will hold open forums to discuss potential new ways of orienting the Class of 2019 to our remarkable community.
Again, we acknowledge that Community Conversations is just one of what we hope will be a lifetime of meaningful, sometimes challenging, but always respectful dialogues about core issues of our humanity. It’s our responsibility and our honor to do this with you. We rely on your engaged participation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a speech to university donors this month, University President Drew G. Faust reiterated her commitment to “making Harvard more open and accessible” and drawing a student body “from the widest possible pool.” As a current undergraduate, a soon-to-be-graduate, and recent alumnus of the College, we couldn’t agree more with those goals. We have all benefited from Harvard’s vibrant community—one crucial to sustaining the critical inquiry that drives Harvard and forging the leaders that Harvard strives to produce.
What helps Harvard also helps the world: By increasing access to students from underrepresented backgrounds—those who stand to gain the most from a Harvard education—Harvard becomes an engine for innovation and social mobility. We are increasingly worried, however, that Harvard’s enrollment is dramatically skewed toward certain segments of the population.
Socioeconomically speaking, the College doesn’t look like the United States at all. Roughly half of the student body is drawn from the top 5 percent of the income bracket, and about as many of us come from the top 1 percent as from the bottom 50 percent. Meanwhile, high-talent, low-income students are persistently overlooked in the application process. These figures suggest that, despite its world-class Financial Aid Initiative, Harvard is falling short of the accessibility it aspires to.
Wealthy students are overrepresented at Harvard in part because of admissions practices that actively favor them. In particular, Harvard continues to give admissions advantages to “legacies”—the children of alumni.
The administration is reluctant to say much about legacy preference, but the little we do know is troubling: In 2011, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons told The Crimson that 30 percent of legacy applicants were accepted to Harvard, as opposed to a rate under 6 percent for non-legacies in 2014. Second, legacies come overwhelmingly from the upper strata of the income distribution. That is why education scholars have dubbed legacy preference “affirmative action for the rich.”
Harvard offers essentially two responses to criticisms of legacy preference. First, Harvard says that legacy preference barely matters in admissions decisions—it’s a “feather on the scale,” a “tie-breaker,” or a “tip factor.” But, at the same time, Harvard also claims that alumni loyalty—including, crucially, alumni donations—would falter in the absence of special consideration for legacies. In short, Harvard suggests that legacy preference is at once a non-factor in admissions and a driving factor behind alumni generosity.
It’s worth considering how Harvard should and shouldn’t raise money. We celebrate generous donors by dedicating buildings, scholarships, and professorships in their names. But there are things Harvard would never do, like guarantee a magna cum laude degree to the child of a high-paying donor, or make legacy status a “tie-breaker” in deciding a course grade.
These policies would surely grow Harvard’s endowment, but only by compromising the values that give that endowment purpose. Bestowing an advantage in admissions is no different. The inherent unfairness of accounting for bloodline in admissions is presumably why prestigious universities around the world—including Oxford, Cambridge, MIT, and Caltech—have shunned legacy preference. And there is a deep irony in the fact that Harvard justifies unfair admissions practices on the premise that they help sustain its need-blind admissions program.
Conversations about legacy preference often devolve into debates about who “deserves” to be at Harvard. Our concern is access, not desert. Affordability is one component of access, but so is admission, and equal access requires fair admissions practices. Legacy preference flies in the face of that requirement, compounding existing inequalities and harkening back to some of Harvard’s ugliest traditions of exclusion. Today, legacy continues to function as a barrier, this time in the name of fundraising.  
We’re skeptical that the Harvard community would be less generous if its children weren't given special treatment. In fact, we believe the opposite: We’re less inclined to support Harvard when it employs unfair admissions policies, and research shows no correlation between alumni giving and legacy preference. As proud members of the Harvard community—one of us, Ben, a legacy himself—we’d prefer that Harvard leave a legacy of equal access, not sacrifice its values for the sake of its endowment. And we think many others feel the same way.
Over the next several months, we will create an organization to engage seriously with the question of access at Harvard. We will enlist students, alumni, and professors to speak up and show the administration that fair access matters to our community. And we will work in tandem with other campuses developing similar initiatives. To stay apprised of, and participate in, this nascent movement, please visit FairAndEqualAccess.org.
Ending legacy preference will be an important step for improving access to Harvard, but it will not be a complete solution. Other changes might include the removal of any inquiry into ability to pay during the application process, the imposition of a complete firewall between Harvard’s development and admissions offices, and the implementation of more robust financial aid programs for middle class students.
Harvard has an opportunity to lead on this issue, and we believe it should—not only because an open and accessible Harvard is a better Harvard but also because ensuring fair and equal access is simply the right thing to do.

Friends, peers, and advisers pay tribute to Cote K. Laramie ’14, who took his life on September 6, 2012, at his home in Pembroke, N.H.
“Looking back at what was even that year and a half ago, I remember him less as the specific person and more as the force of life: radiant, musical, present.  Reminders: of the fragility and power of seeing beauty.   So long as the flowers have scent, mothers love their sons, the stars shine, and the green grass trembles, I will never forget him.  I suppose then, I think about Cote often. For he is here as he was then.”–Hilton R. Simmet ’15
“Cote had a talent for lifting your spirits and making you laugh. His energy and joy were infectious and I’m so grateful that, for a brief time, he chose to share them with me.”–Nicole M. Morreale ’13
“Cote was one of the best listeners I ever knew; you could talk to him about anything and he always listened with an open heart and mind. I had many late nights staying up and chatting with him, we would chat about anything ranging from physics to our personal struggles and Cote would always be fully invested in the conversation.”–Geoffrey Y. Lee ’14
Cote was like a shooting star who lit up the Harvard firmament. He left an indelible impression on all whom he encountered, students, faculty and staff.–Ali S. Asani ’77, professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic religion and cultures
“Cote, you are a beacon of guiding light, the buoy that kept us blockmates afloat. I long for your easy smiles, your ready assurances, and your eager loquacity. Our spontaneous conversations and your touching poetry are the only words of yours I have now. They are forever enshrined in my soul.”–Preston G. So ’14

Kevin Galvin, senior communications director for Harvard Public Affairs and Communications who has worked closely with University President Drew G. Faust, will leave the University this summer to assume a vice presidential position at Arizona State University, according to a release last week from ASU. 
Galvin arrived at HPAC in 2008 after working as the deputy national editor at the Boston Globe. Prior to the Globe, Galvin worked at the Associated Press in a number of roles, including White House correspondent. At ASU, he will serve as vice president for media relations and strategic communications.
Galvin became the primary spokesperson for Faust in the summer of 2012. Since then, he has sat in on most of the president’s media obligations, including those with The Crimson. Galvin has also worked to coordinate the media work of leadership at Harvard Management Company, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and other officials in the University’s central administration.
“It has been an honor to work with President Faust and I hope that I have been of some service to Harvard,” Galvin wrote in a statement last week. “I grew up in Greater Boston and have long admired the University as a place where big ideas are generated and challenged, and faculty and students strive to shape the future. The chance to play a role at the institution has been the experience of a lifetime.”
Paul Andrew, acting vice president for communications, wrote on Monday that Jeff Neal, who currently oversees the media plan for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and its dean, Michael D. Smith, will leave that role and begin working with Faust and Garber after Galvin departs. The rest of Galvin’s portfolio, including his work with HMC, has not yet been reassigned. 
“Kevin has played a pivotal role in strengthening our media relations efforts, and we thank him for his service and wish him well in his new role,” Andrew wrote in a statement.
Of Neal, Andrew wrote, “Jeff is an exceptionally skilled communications professional who has managed a wide range of issues at Harvard.  He has shown an ability to convey news of institutional priorities and the remarkable work of Harvard faculty to audiences within our community and beyond.”

UPDATED: June 17, 2015, at 2:00 p.m.
Sociology professor Michèle Lamont will become faculty director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs beginning July 2015, the center announced Tuesday. The decision comes a year after Government professor Beth A. Simmons stepped down from the faculty director position amid debate with administrators about the distribution of the center’s funds.
Lamont, who is also a professor of European as well as African and African American studies, has served as acting director of the Weatherhead Center—the largest international research center within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—during the spring semester.
She will become director during a period of financial strain for research centers across FAS. Following the 2008-2009 financial crisis, which took a particularly hard toll on FAS, the body enacted a policy that called for regional centers to contribute large portions of their funds to a centralized operational fund. As the University budget began to recover, Simmons, who became director of the center in 2007, requested that administrators end the so-called “taxation policy.” When administrators did not yield to her request, Simmons resigned from her position last spring.
According to Lamont, despite FAS’s recent reduction of mandated payout rate by 10 percent, the Weatherhead Center has required to contribute over $4 million to the FAS relief effort since the crisis.
Lamont said that she will have to strategically plan her operations as director to sustain the Center’s involvement in international affairs while maintaining financial stability. When she takes office in 2015, she plans to rearrange the 38 seminars currently organized by faculty members affiliated with the center into clusters so that the activities of the center will be focused around several themes.
“Before accepting I had a meeting with the executive committee of the Weatherhead, and I got a strong endorsement for taking a more aggressive role as a director for shaping the agenda of the center by overlapping several research clusters,” Lamont said.
Lamont has been involved with the Weatherhead Center for several years, including serving on the Center’s steering committee that creates grants to fund faculty work.
While Lamont is on sabbatical leave for the 2014-2015 academic year, Government professor Jeffry A. Frieden will serve as acting director for the center.
Frieden expressed faith in Lamont’s ability to lead the Weatherhead Center after his tenure as acting director concludes.
“I am confident that professor Lamont will continue the Weatherhead Center’s long-standing tradition of academic excellence, as well as take WCFIA in important new scholarly directions,” Frieden wrote in an email.

Female workers at the Boston-Cambridge DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel are calling on Class Day speaker and Facebook executive Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 to support their efforts to unionize.
 
Continuing their yearlong campaign to pressure the hotel chain to allow fair process unionization, DoubleTree employees created an online petition and video in hopes that Sandberg, co-author of “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,” will hold a “Lean In Circle,” a women’s peer support group inspired by Sandberg’s book, for them.
Since DoubleTree employees initially signed a petition in support of unionization in March 2013, workers and activists have asked Harvard to put pressure on the hotel, which is run by Hilton but housed in a Harvard-owned building, in hopes that managers will be more receptive to allowing fair process unionization.
However, over the last several months, the University has maintained that the issue should be resolved between Hilton and the union, UNITE HERE! Local 26. Hilton Worldwide has said it does not believe that a true majority of Doubletree employees wish to be represented by any union—a prerequisite of fair process unionization. 
 
Sandberg told Doubletree workers she is too busy to meet with them, according to Doubletree housekeeper Delmy Lemus, who spearheaded the online petition asking Sandberg to host the Lean In circle. Lemus expressed disappointment that Sandberg would not be able to join her and her coworkers.


 
“Maybe in her mind she is not going to say yes to everyday people like us working hard, and she thinks that we are low-class people,” Lemus said. “But she is wrong because we work hard, and we are women.”
 
Doubletree employees and Student Labor Action Movement activists said they plan todistribute flyers at Sandberg’s Class Day address on Wednesday to raise awareness for their campaign. They also will hold a Lean In Circle on Thursday afternoon, which SLAM expects 15 to 20 female Doubletree workers will attend, regardless of whether or not Sandberg joins.
 
“[Sheryl Sandberg] is such a powerful women's rights activist,” SLAM member Zoe A. Onion ’17 said. “There are lots of problems in women’s rights at the DoubleTree…. We hope that she will bring more public attention to it and also empowers the women at the DoubleTree.”
 
Several Harvard feminist organizations have also rallied in support of the petition, echoing concerns of critics that Sandberg, while proclaiming a message of feminist empowerment, caters to an educated, upper-class demographic rather than to all women. 
 
“On a basic level, for me, feminism is always about putting the most marginalized in the center and that means that we don’t just focus on getting women into CEO positions, we also focus on getting domestic women basic rights,” said Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15, president of the Radcliffe Union of Students, a feminist student group.
Despite the controversy Sandberg’s book has inspired in some circles, many activists see her presence on campus as a time to gain visibility for the cause of Doubletree workers.
 
“Having that access to [Sandberg] is an opportunity for the women of the Doubletree who have been fighting to get heard by Harvard,” said Kirin Gupta ’16, co-director of the Harvard College International Women’s Rights Collective.
 Sandberg had not returned a request for comment by press time on Monday.

Brett Flehinger has been selected to serve as the interim secretary of the Administrative Board starting this summer, as the College prepares for the most significant period of transition in its disciplinary system in decades.
Currently the associate secretary of the Administrative Board, Flehinger will replace the current head of the Ad Board, John “Jay” L. Ellison on July 1.
Flehinger, who earned a Ph.D. in History at Harvard in 1997 and is a lecturer in the History Department, has worked alongside Ellison on the Ad Board for nearly five years, first joining the board in 2009 as the Lowell House resident dean. Just days before Harvard made public the Government 1310 cheating investigation in 2012, Flehinger was appointed to his current position, specifically created to address issues of academic integrity.
“My plans are to get through the rest of this term...and then to kind of emphasize the things that I think are most central to the mission [of the Ad Board]: making sure that when students [come before the Ad Board] they are treated as humanely, as carefully, as accurately as possible,” Flehinger said in an interview on Friday.
Flehinger’s appointment comes as the College seeks to find permanent replacements for many members of the Ad Board. In addition to Ellison, both Adams House Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell and Cabot House Resident Dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees will be departing Harvard at the end of the academic term.
Flehinger said that he has not been involved in the College’s search and selection process for Ellison’s permanent successor, adding that that process is under the purview of Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister and incoming Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. In an interview in April, Pfister said that Ellison’s upcoming departure could be a chance for the College to review the organization of the Ad Board. Neither Pfister nor Khurana could be reached for comment on Monday.
As interim secretary, Flehinger will not only have to provide support for the new resident deans as they become acquainted with the College’s disciplinary system, but also facilitate the creation of the student-faculty honor board—which will hear accusations of academic dishonesty—set to begin adjudicating cases in the fall of 2015.
“I think we have a lot of work to do next year that’s important work, to not only design the new board, to put it in place, and to really realize the kind of training, the recruitment that’s going to start to signal and create the kind of cultural shifts that we’re for,” Flehinger said.
Despite the changes, Flehinger said that he expects the disciplinary body to continue to run smoothly in the next year.
“The board has to continue to do thoughtful efficient careful good work. That would have been the case no matter what,” Flehinger said.

Although four out of five faculty members from across the University say that they are satisfied as members of the Harvard faculty, women and members of underrepresented minority groups report higher rates of feelings of exclusion than men and non-minorities, according to the results of the 2013 Faculty Climate Survey.
Since the Office of the Senior Vice Provost began conducting the survey in 2007, ladder faculty said they have become more comfortable within their departments and feel that their colleagues value their research. But among female professors, departmental community is reportedly less collegial; they were less likely to agree with statements like “the department is a good fit for me” and “the department accommodates family responsibilities” than their male counterparts.
In addition, 62 percent of women, compared to 79 percent of male faculty members, agreed that their respective school or department “makes genuine efforts to recruit female faculty.” The divide was also present in responses to a question that asked respondents to agree or disagree that they “feel that the climate for female faculty in the School/Department is at least as good as for male faculty.” While 58 percent of men agreed with this statement, 44 percent of women did.  
A greater percentage of female than male respondents also said they feel that they have to work harder to be perceived as a legitimate scholar and that they feel excluded from an “informal network.” In both instances, the rate of agreement was about 30 percent for women, as opposed to 20 percent for men.
While perceptions about faculty climate were more consistent across race than across gender, perceptions about the role of race in the workplace tended to be less positive.
Survey results show that faculty members have similar views about the University’s climate for faculty members from underrepresented minority groups—defined as black, Hispanic, and Native American. Around 60 percent of respondents said their respective school or department makes a genuine effort to recruit minority faculty, and about half of all respondents said that their school’s or department’s climate for underrepresented minority faculty members is at least as good as it is for non-minority faculty. 
About a quarter of all underrepresented minority faculty members said that they feel excluded from an “informal network.” Twenty percent of non-minority faculty members agreed that they feel excluded from an informal network.
Since 2007, faculty, while more satisfied overall, reported that they have become less satisfied in the areas of the quality of graduate and professional students, teaching infrastructure, the availability of teaching assistants, and support for securing grants.

Outgoing Institute of Politics Director C. M. Trey Grayson ’94 has accepted a position as president of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, Grayson announced earlier this week.
In a letter posted on the IOP website last month, Grayson cited his responsibility to his two daughters in the fifth and eighth grade as his main impetus for resigning, and announced plans to return to his home state of Kentucky following the end of the academic year.
Addressing a Politico article claiming that he had been forced out of his position by the IOP Senior Advisory Committee, Grayson insisted that the article was erroneous and the resignation was his choice.
Grayson plans on moving back to the area of Northern Kentucky where he grew up and lived as Secretary of State there before moving to Cambridge to assume his position at the IOP.
Although Grayson has not ruled out returning to politics sometime in the future, he said his new position will be a full-time job, managing around 25 employees and hundreds of volunteers throughout the community.
Grayson will begin working for the Chamber on July 1.
Grayson said he plans on drawing on his experience at the IOP to lead the Chamber, citing parallels between the two organizations.
“In some respects, [the Chamber is] similar to the IOP, where you have staff that works side by side with volunteers,” Grayson said.
Grayson also said he is excited to continue his passion for improving his community through public service.
“The chamber helps to unify the region, unify the governments, unify the businesses, unify schools and universities and nonprofits to try to improve the quality of life. So that sounds like a good job to me,” Grayson said.

Harvard’s chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the country’s oldest academic honor society, welcomed its last batch of graduating seniors on Tuesday morning.
Ninety-two seniors joined the ranks of the nation’s oldest continuously operating Phi Beta Kappa chapter, enjoying some desert-themed poetry and a scientific reading at the 224th installment of the annual literary exercises in Sanders Theatre, an event which has been a staple of the College’s Commencement activities since 1782.
These inductees round out the Phi Beta Kappa membership of the class of 2014, following the election of the “Junior 24” last spring and the “Senior 48” in November.
All students in the top 10 percent of each academic division according to grade point average are automatically considered for the honors society, and final elections are conducted by chapter officers on the basis of transcripts and departmental honors recommendations. Students not recommended for honors within their concentration typically will not be elected to the society.
Environmental Sciences professor Ann Pearson, president of Harvard’s chapter, which is called Alpha Iota of Massachusetts, opened the ceremony by discussing the award as not simply a “feather in the cap” of the seniors being honored but a “roadmap” for their futures, praising them for their “skills in critical thinking.”
The literary exercises also featured readings by poet Donald Revell and author Andrea Barrett, along with two performances by the commencement choir. Past speakers include New York Times reporter Linda J. Greenhouse ’68, a former Crimson editor, Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, and poet Allen Ginsberg.
In addition to the graduating seniors, five members of the Class of 1964, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this weekend, were inducted as honorary members into the society, including Harvard Law professor Robert H. Mnookin ’64 and Kennedy School of Government professor Sheila S. Jasanoff ’64. The ceremony also recognized three professors—English professor Philip J. Fisher, Philosophy professor Alison Simmons, and Molecular and Cellular Biology lecturer Thomas Torello—who received teaching prizes from the society.
Although the chapter typically awards an honorary degree each year to a faculty member who will retire in that year, English professor Daniel G. Donoghue departed from tradition when choosing this year’s honoree, English professor emeritus Daniel B. Aaron. Aaron, who helped found the Library of America and received a National Humanities Medal in 2010, became an honorary member of Harvard’s Phi Beta Kappa chapter even though he retired in 1983.
Donaghue lauded Aaron’s accomplishments, noting that despite collecting many awards and recognitions, the 101-year-old professor had never been invited to join the honors society.
“Today, we correct that oversight,” Donaghue said.
During the ceremony’s concluding benediction, Rev. Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church, encouraged the class to combine their knowledge with service.
“As you leave this place, be sure not to leave the presence of Harvard behind,” Walton said. 
University President Drew G. Faust and interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister were among those in attendance at Tuesday’s event.

University President Drew G. Faust challenged the College’s Class of 2014 to leave Harvard with a firmly-set moral compass in her address at the class’s Baccalaureate service on Tuesday afternoon, referencing the popular television series “Breaking Bad” and asking rhetorically, “How do you end up ‘breaking good?’”
Faust, who interviewed “Breaking Bad” creator Vince Gilligan earlier this spring, surprised some in attendance by weaving the show’s dark storyline into an address that is usually celebratory and sentimental. In recounting her conversation with Gilligan and her viewing of “Breaking Bad,” Faust drew a contrast between the show’s main character Walter White’s demise as a greedy, violent drug lord and what she identified as the seniors’ responsibility to use their education for others.
“Learning is partly about taking risks for the sake of achievement and excellence. These are values we share and celebrate. But more important, these past four years have also been designed to teach you about facing outward, acting for the sake of a better human community,” Faust said.
Faust concluded her remarks with a tone closer to what the seniors might have expected.
“The most important thing for you to have learned here at Harvard is that far from ending with your degrees on Thursday, your education, and the service to others that is its greatest purpose, has only begun,” she said.
Before yielding the lectern, she added, “May you all have lives as good as they are great.”
The service, a tradition more than two centuries old, was an intimate affair, with more than 1,600 degree candidates squeezed into a space that fits about 1,000. But the College’s seniors, who are set to graduate on Thursday, did not seem to mind, and most laughed when Faust took the lectern and declared that her address came “during a week of high spirits hardly designed for sobriety.” Early in the speech, the president scored additional comedic points with the crowd with her references to Tinder, Snapchat, and I Saw You Harvard.
“I wasn’t ready for it,” said Justin Mathew ’14 of Faust’s jesting approach. “But I thought she did a really good job with the speech.”
Samantha B. Singh ’14 agreed. “I thought she did a really good job of avoiding cliche,” she said.
The intimacy continued after the service, when Faust and Walton positioned themselves just outside the doors of the Church and formed a receiving line, the back of which wound throughout the Church and stalled frequently as students and the occasional relative posed with Faust for photos.
“I’m never going to wash this hand,” more than a few seniors joked after shaking Faust’s hand.
After passing through the line, the degree candidates made their way to the steps of Widener Library for a class photo, where a team of professionals along with hundreds of parents snapped away.
Commencement week continues Wednesday with the College’s Class Day, where Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 is scheduled to deliver the keynote address. Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a graduate of the Business School, will address graduates and their families at the University’s 363rd Commencement Exercises on Thursday.
