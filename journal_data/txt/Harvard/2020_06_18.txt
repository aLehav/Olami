After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s annual Board of Overseers and Harvard Alumni Association director elections will begin on July 1, according to University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy.
The Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — advises Harvard administrators and approves certain actions taken by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Members serve six-year terms.
The University previously announced the 2020 Harvard elections would be postponed until early to mid-July due to the “uncertainty” posed by the global pandemic. The election was originally scheduled to be held from April 1 to May 19.
Harvard Forward, a coalition of students and alumni pushing for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry, supported five candidates for the board: John E. Beatty ’11, Lisa Bi Huang, Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Dorothy “Thea” Sebastian ’08, and Jayson U. Toweh.
Each of the five candidates received over 4,500 signatures. Candidates must gain roughly 3,000 alumni signatures to join the ballot.
The Harvard Alumni Association supported a different slate of candidates for the Board of Overseers ballot: Raphael W. Bostic ’87, Katherine Collins, David H. Eun ’89, Diego A. Rodriguez, Tracy K. Smith ’94, Miki Uchida Tsusaka ’84, and Ryan M. Wise.
In March, Harvard Forward announced that it would hold an entirely online campaign as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Harvard Forward also announced its support for six candidates contending to become Harvard Alumni Association Elected Directors: Santiago Creuheras, Kelsey T. Leonard ’10, Michael D. Lewis ’93, Benjamin D. Wei ’08, Joyce Y. Zhang ’09, and Vanessa M. Zoltan. These candidates support “Harvard Forward’s platform of climate action, socially responsible investment, and inclusive governance,” according to a press release from the group.
All Harvard degree holders — except those in University instruction and governance positions and members of the Harvard Corporation — are eligible to vote in the elections by traditional paper ballot or online.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Black Teacher Archives, a research project archiving content about the history of African American education, was recently launched at the Graduate School of Education.
Funded by a $610,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon foundation, the Black Teacher Archives seeks to “lay the groundwork for a dynamic digital archive to rejuvenate academic scholarship in the field of African American educational history,” according to its grant proposal.
Jarvis R. Givens, an assistant professor at the Ed School and affiliate of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s department of African and African American Studies, and Imani Perry, a professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, will co-lead the project.
Givens said that he was inspired to lead the effort in part by his academic interest in Carter G. Woodson, an African American scholar known as the “Father of Black History.”
“I was interested in him because he wrote a book that is a pretty important text called ‘The Miseducation of the Negro,’ which is a book he wrote in 1933,” Givens said. “But then, I started to learn, I started to become interested in how it was that this teacher, who was primarily based at this point in Washington D.C., how was it that you find his textbooks making their way to schools in Oklahoma and across the country?”
It was through this realization that he began studying “Colored Teachers Associations,” which were networks of “Black teachers in the 20th century,” according to Givens.
But materials from the associations proved hard to find — prompting Givens and Imani to digitally archive and catalog them.
“These Black Teacher Associations were actually very critical for the kind of activism of teachers and a lot of the behind-the-scenes work they were doing,” Givens said. “When I started to look more for the language of the organizations, it was kind of hard to locate some of the materials that they publish.”
Givens said the Black Teacher Archives will allow scholars to tell more detailed accounts of African American educators.
“I think making these journals more widely available will allow for scholars to tell more nuanced and complicated stories about black teachers, in the educational work that they did, and also the political work that they did,” he said.
The team plans to partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities for the project — a move Givens said is particularly important, given that the schools possess many of the relevant records.
Givens said he hopes that the Black Teacher Archives can serve as a tool to empower today’s Black educators.
“It's my hope that the model that these Black educators historically created and that they used to advocate for themselves and for Black students might provide some inspiration and a model that contemporary Black teachers and critical educators can look to, as they continue to try to do work on challenging structural inequality and structural racism that persists in schools today,” he said.

Nancy Coleman will serve as the new Dean of the Division of Continuing Education beginning July 13, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay announced in an email to FAS faculty and staff Thursday.
Gay announced the search for a new DCE dean in December of 2019, following then-Dean Huntington D. Lambert’s announcement of his retirement at the end of the calendar year. Since January, DCE Associate Dean and Chief Innovation Officer Henry H. Leitner has served as interim dean.
The DCE houses the Extension School and the Summer School, among other programs designed for nontraditional students.
In her email, Gay wrote that Coleman will bring “a passion for student success” and “a deep commitment to expanding access and opportunities.”
“Nancy is joining Harvard at a moment when advancing creative and sophisticated models of online learning is mission critical,” Gay wrote. “I’m delighted to have her as a partner as we imagine the future of both DCE and the FAS as we adapt our teaching and learning in a post COVID-19 world.”
Coleman joins Harvard from Wellesley College, where she has served as Associate Provost and Director of Strategic Growth Initiatives since 2016. In the position, she was responsible for leading Wellesley Extended, an arm of Wellesley encompassing summer programs, online learning, and professional education.
Prior to her tenure at Wellesley, Coleman also served in administration at Keypath Education, an online program management provider, as well as at Boston University, where she was the Director of Distance Education.
Additionally, Coleman was elected as the President of the University Professional and Continuing Education Association for the 2020-2021 term. She previously served as director-at-large on the board.
Coleman holds a Ed.D. in Human and Organizational Learning from George Washington University, as well as an MBA from Boston University and a B.S. from Stonehill College.
“She joins the FAS poised to advance DCE’s mission of extending Harvard to part-time learners with the academic ability, curiosity, and drive to succeed in rigorous courses and programs,” Gay wrote. “Even as we enter a time of significant challenge, Nancy will be an energetic builder and connecter, deepening ties between DCE and the rest of the FAS and committed to a transformative experience for all our students.”
