After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By pure virtue of my being an editor for The Harvard Crimson, you would be safe to assume that I’m someone who enjoys writing. But if you’ve read any of my previous pieces, it’s likely that you’ve noticed a spot or two where my prose could certainly have been improved. This may have something to do with the fact that I’ve never taken a creative writing class. I haven’t had the chance to formally learn the skills that could take my writing from amateur to professional. But this is certainly not from a lack of trying. As I’m writing this piece, I’m entering my third round of applying to the English department’s creative writing classes.
For the third time, I will have to go through the course descriptions and application requirements, choose which four classes I’d like a chance to be a part of, rank my preferences, and submit writing samples that differ in length and type depending on the specific class. This arduous process limits who has access to creative writing classes by demanding that one must already have attained a certain level of proficiency before they are granted the chance to learn and improve in this field.
On the one hand, I do understand why these classes are difficult to get into. The class sizes have to be kept small in order for everyone to truly benefit from the seminar or workshop format. And it’s fair for English concentrators to be given preference because they’ve indicated that studying English is their passion and that these creative writing courses are crucial for their ultimate career goals. Ultimately, resources in the form of professors, scheduling availabilities, and time are limited.
On the other hand, I do believe that the selection process is inherently flawed. If anything, those with the least impressive writing samples should be accepted into the workshops because they have the most to learn. By only allowing the most talented writers into the classes, Harvard is perpetuating the idea that a student has to be the best in the field to even qualify for consideration. There’s no room for people to explore new paths or learn new skills. Students are limited to their preexisting strengths and barred from the exploratory growth that the college experience is said to be.
This problem is not unique to the creative writing classes. There are other application or audition classes, often found in the Theater, Dance, and Media department. And while these academic limitations may only affect a subsection of the student body, the same prohibitory outlook hits most Harvard students through the comp processes of different clubs and extracurricular organizations. Competitive comps tell students that there is no point of trying something new because you won’t have the opportunity to pursue it unless you’re already remarkably talented — whether that be consulting, improv comedy, or debate.
Such structurally embedded competition forces students into realms of specification, often being forced to build on skills they possessed before arriving at Harvard. Few people are encouraged to push beyond their comfort zones. Instead, students are actively encouraged to remain in their comfort zones by the high barriers in entry to new fields, like these competitive applications.
Worse yet, no one is allowed to be bad at things. We don’t have the chance to partake in activities for pure joy instead of achievement. Before coming to Harvard, I was on my high school’s junior varsity dance team, I submitted pieces to my school’s literary magazine, and I performed in plays. In all of these activities, I was regularly one of the worst in the room, but that was okay. I was allowed to have fun and bond with my friends. At Harvard, however, I’ve been discouraged from pursuing joy at the expense of achievement. Many of us have been discouraged from branching out into new fields without having the safety net of pre-established merit.
I do acknowledge there are some spaces on campus where there exist no such structural barriers to participation — intramural sports, cultural organizations, and comp-free clubs such as Kuumba. In fact, the Crimson Editorial Board’s no cuts comp is one of the reasons I’m writing this article right now. Nevertheless, the success driven attitude at Harvard persists, and the competitive atmosphere often wins out. Most people are disincentivized from joining a group if they feel they stand no chance of being the best and rising to leadership. Instead, they are funnelled to activities where they can achieve traditional success, build their resumes, and further their career goals.
Despite my qualms with the English department's application, I do intend to keep applying to creative writing classes until I get in or graduate — whichever happens first. I love to write, I’m in an environment where I have to opportunity to learn from some of the best professors in the world, so I won’t let fear of failure or frustration with the system keep me from trying to improve myself. I hope that those of you reading this will continue to pursue new activities for the purpose of self-improvement and simple joy. Perhaps with enough demand, the culture can change. Until then, I have some applications to write.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This week’s reading assignment: Yuri Herrera’s ‘Trabajos del Reino.’ Come to class prepared for discussion.” And so we did. We touched gender, art, power, fairy tales. The novella describes a drug cartel through the language and structure of a medieval kingdom. It gave us a platform to investigate problems old and contemporary, to debate  solutions theoretical and practical.
I read fiction because of works like this. Fiction is often seen as a simple break from “real” reading. We sit, move our eyes from left to right, then reset them like a typewriter to read the next line. We enjoy a good story without learning anything beyond common sense or that holds value on our increasingly STEM-focused campus. But these arguments ignore how we can learn about life from fiction, discover who we are as individuals, and explore how we come together as societies.
Before I go any further, let me emphatically state that reading passively — that is, principally for entertainment value — is valid: We don’t criticize people when they watch a movie for the story instead of analyzing the effectiveness of color choices or variation in cinematic techniques, do we? But we must not discount the value of fiction as a learning tool.
From self-help books to autobiographies, countless works of nonfiction claim to teach readers about self improvement, promising friends, money, and knowledge. They posit themselves as an unimpeachable authority, giving the reader advice as a doctor would. Perhaps their advice is valuable, perhaps it is common sense, but they place their ideas and solutions as definitive and superior. With fiction, however, readers are encouraged to think independently and challenge the text. What is the message? Is the message true and justified? Are these characters fundamentally good? Is the narrator reliable, and how could that change the story’s message? And readers can remember what they learned because fiction is  accompanied by a story purposefully crafted to be relatable and memorable. Even “How to Win Friends and Influence People” will tell you: “This is the day of dramatization. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it.” And fiction does it too.
Nonfiction is not valueless: Almost every job requires nonfiction. Even literary critics study the lives of authors and the contexts of their works. Nonfiction has an intrinsic value: I will learn facts. Fiction, on the other hand, is often perceived as intrinsically pretentious, as being inaccessible to people without formal language or literature education. But, in reality, it’s about the individual experience of reading. Yes, discussing literature with a classroom of perceptive students can be extremely valuable, but let’s recognize that fiction teaches us about ourselves, both individually and collectively. It not only fosters individual empathy but teaches us about universal ideas: power, love, family, truth.
Just as we learn the value of freedom and equality by studying the Jim Crow-era South in a U.S. history class, we learn the struggles of oppression and identity from Ralph Ellison’s “Invisible Man.” Just as scientific studies warn us against antibiotic resistant bacteria, Orwell’s “1984” warns against censorship and surveillance. Fiction, here, mirrors life. In this way, fiction allows people to explore areas in which they may not have as much interest or expertise without compromising entertainment or complexity. You don’t need to understand the structure, powers, and mechanisms of the CIA to understand Big Brother or Newspeak. For this reason, fiction isn’t inaccessible to the average person. Accessing fiction doesn’t require training; fiction individualizes the foreign. Fiction is a primary vessel that creates accessibility, allowing you to sail through uncharted seas and see truths about life.
So, don’t discount fiction. Remember reading “Catcher in the Rye” in high school? Hate it? Still rant about it when a friend brings it up, or feel a fire grow in your stomach when someone mentions it? Did you vow to never touch a novel, poem, or short story for the rest of your life? Whatever your “Catcher in the Rye” is, pick up a copy and keep it around for the next time you have an hour or two. And then read it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Outing Club’s mission statement reads, “Founded in 1939, The HOC exists purely to help the Harvard community get outside and have fun in the outdoors. So whether we're hiking, backpacking, camping, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, or biking, we want you to come along.” It follows that the Harvard Outing Club is one of the most inclusive organizations on-campus. With a limited fee of $20 for six months of membership, need-blind financial aid, and no application, anyone is welcome on any of the club’s weekend outings, which cater to students of all levels of outdoorsmanship. And yet, in the midst of the University’s push to increase social inclusivity on campus, the Outing Club is being, for lack of a better word, punished.
Since its founding in 1939, the Outing Club has been privileged to have a small, hole-in-the-wall office space at 15 Linden Street, buried in the aging Adams House walls. Leaders, members, and their friends fondly call it the HOCice (spelling variable). The space not only stores all of the gear the club lends out, but also provides a cozy and central space for the group to gather — planning hiking outings and events to get students involved in the outdoor community. During the renovation of Adams House, however, the space will be closed for good, and the Outing Club will be moved to a yet-to-be-determined shared storage space.
I — notably not a member of the Outing Club — am definitely disappointed to see one of Harvard’s charming hidden nooks taken away. More importantly, however, the decision is an apt example of how the College has failed to provide (and protect) adequate alternative social spaces as it rallies to minimize the impact of  final clubs on campus. For many, after all, the HOCice served as a refuge from the often overwhelming presence of these clubs. A casual gathering at the HOCice, whose door is always open when people are inside, a leader reminded me — listening to music, strumming an old toy of a guitar, commenting on the maps and the crunchy décor – was a meaningful alternative to the Delphic up the street or the Fly across Mt. Auburn Street. The Outing Club, with its open square dances and HOCtoberfest, is for many students an icon of inclusive social life on campus, and a window for new experiences. For instance, at the end of last semester the Outing Club brought 120 students to a climbing gym in Boston, an event they will repeat this semester. Though I have no doubt the organization will persevere, the removal of its beloved space dishonors that well-earned reputation.
Overall, Harvard has done a poor job of offering social alternatives for students who don’t feel comfortable or included in the final club scene. Leaving the task of community building mostly to the Houses, the College has not stepped up to show the way toward a more inclusive future. It is no wonder, therefore, that students continue to gravitate toward final clubs. The Pforzheimer Igloo is great, but it definitely leaves something to be desired, as it is cramped and hot beyond belief. Everyone loves a good dorm party, but opportunities are often limited by House administrators. For example, Eliot House residents can only have two dorm parties per night, can only have those parties on Friday and Saturday, and are prohibited from having any events on nights before the LSAT or MCAT — an understandable restriction but one which severely limits the possible dates. Freshmen, it should be noted, have almost no sanctioned social outlet at all. The College strictly limits in the number of people allowed in their dorms, forbids them to possess any alcohol, and does not provide them with accessible and welcoming common spaces – a big part of why punch is so exciting for the sophomore class.
If Harvard wishes to guide the undergraduate body toward a more inclusive model of social life, it needs to create more spaces for students to socialize. The last thing the College should be doing is closing recognized social and semi-social venues. Harvard should seek to provide more recognized organizations, especially those with a track record of hosting inclusive social events, with the means and resources to bring students in, make them feel comfortable and welcome. Doing so would not only help with this noble work, but also send the message that Harvard supports this sort of social leadership on campus.
I remember the last time I was at the HOCice. It was absolutely pouring outside; the door, a great metaphor, beckoning beneath Claverly Hall, appeared through the slanting sheets. Inside it was warm; a couple other small groups of students had also found the shelter. We made friends; we laughed; we dried out; and when the clouds lifted, we went home. Such is the legacy of the HOCice. I thank the members of the Harvard Outing Club for sharing it with me and so many other night-drifters stuck outside in the bitter rain.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and Cambridge residents flooded Harvard Square to sample free treats at the Chocolate Tasting Event Saturday, part of the weekend’s 11th Annual Taste of Chocolate Festival.
Seventeen Harvard Square and Massachusetts businesses, including Amorino Gelato, Blackbird Doughnuts, J.P. Licks, Flour Bakery, and Sweetie Ice Cream participated in the chocolate tasting. The festival was organized by the Harvard Square Business Association and sponsored by Cambridge Savings Bank and Ameriprise.
The free chocolate did not come without consequences: significant wait times. Participants and vendors alike said they were surprised by the large crowd.
“We never thought so many people would be here,” said Wholesome Fresh manager Jianan Jiang. “We prepared like twenty boxes of different kinds of chocolate, [and] so far I think we’ve gone through maybe five or ten boxes,” Jiang said ten minutes after the festival opened.
The line snaked from the front of Felipe’s Mexican Taqueria on Brattle Street — where the vendors were located — along Massachusetts Avenue and back to Church Street. The end of the line nearly reached Brattle Street again. Chocophiles reported wait times between 20 minutes to an hour to reach the vendors’ tables.
“We got here at about 12:15, so in total we waited an hour,” said Somerville resident Kyle Farrell, a dinner-sized plate filled with chocolate goodies by his side. “We’ve been a few times in the past, and we plotted it out this time and arrived at the best time, we think.”
A drum group from Grooversity, a global drumming project, entertained sweet-toothed patrons waiting in line with percussion music combining samba and axé music with funk, rock, jazz, and hip hop.
Springfield, Mass. resident Amanda McCabe-Hernandez, a first-time festival-goer, said she has long been planning to attend the tasting.
“I found out about this event like three or four months ago, and it’s been in my calendar ever since then,” McCabe-Hernandez said.
For the owners of Sweetie Ice Cream, a low-fat ice cream company, the tasting event presented an opportunity to market their products to consumers who are often more familiar with major national brands. They performed a blind taste-test, providing attendees with bags containing a sample of Sweetie Ice Cream and a sample of national brand Halo Top’s ice cream.
“We’re going up against the number one selling ice cream in America right now, which is Halo Top...we’re trying to see if we can take down the giant, so we’re trying to get the Harvard Square opinion,” Christina Billotti, a part-owner of the company, said.
Jeffrey Joel, a representative from Saloniki Greek — which opened last fall in the Smith Campus Center — said the chocolate tasting event was a “fun” opportunity for the restaurant.
“It helps the society, and that way we get to market our cookies. We’re really good at Greek cookies,” said Joel, as he handed out double chocolate olive oil and sea salt cookies.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association and one of the event’s organizers, said the Chocolate Festival tradition started over a decade ago.
“It came about eleven years ago, when we asked our retailers and restaurants what we could do to help them,” Jillson said. “And they said what you could really do is to give us a boost in January and February when it’s cold and people can stay home and not come to the Square quite as much as they do in the summer and the warmer months.”
As a result, the Harvard Square Business Association started its annual Winter Carnival — which spans January to March and features the Chocolate Festival as one of its attractions — eleven years ago.
For college students hoping to score some free food and gain a better sense of what Harvard Square has to offer, the Winter Carnival will continue through the next few weeks. Upcoming events include next weekend’s “Some Like It Hot” Chili Cook Off, Lovin’ the Square Valentine’s events, and a capstone Chinese New Year celebration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard, in conjunction with a coalition of universities across Massachusetts and the country, slammed United States Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos’s proposed changes to Title IX rules in comments published last week.
The schools’ feedback came as part of their official response to DeVos’s proposed changes to Title IX, a federal law that underpins Harvard’s policies on gender and sex-based discrimination. In particular, they focused on changes that would require live cross-examinations in sexual harassment investigation proceedings.
DeVos released the initial rules in November 2018, opening them up to a 60-day comment period that will end Jan. 30. The rules have faced criticism since an earlier version was leaked in August 2018. So far, the Department has received more than 70,000 comments on the new rules.
On Jan. 23, the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts — a group of 60 higher education institutions in the Commonwealth including Harvard — sent comments to the government arguing the new rules “may undermine rather than advance Title IX’s very purpose.”
The association opposed the cross-examination change, arguing it might deter victims of sexual misconduct from coming forward. Live hearings with cross-examination in Title IX proceedings were strongly discouraged under Obama-era enforcement rules, but DeVos’s changes require the practice, allowing for opposing parties to be in separate rooms during the hearings with a neutral mediator if they wish.
“This restrictive mandate is inappropriate for many institutions and the underlying requirements may deter complainants from reporting discrimination and harassment and undermine Title IX’s objective,” AICUM wrote in its comments.
Eight pages of AICUM’s 17-page commentary focused on the cross-examinations.
The coalition argued the new hearing mandate would make it difficult for volunteer advisors to support individuals involved in complaints, exacerbating inequities between complainants and respondents who can afford outside counsel for the hearings and those who rely on University-provided resources.
“Where one party with economic means retains a skilled lawyer as an advisor, the other party who cannot afford such representation, whether complainant or respondent, will be at a distinct disadvantage,” AICUM wrote.
AICUM also argued that several aspects of the new rules threaten students’ confidentiality. If adopted in their curent form, the rules would make all evidence available to both parties and eliminate restrictions on all parties’ rights to speak about allegations. They would also require Title IX coordinators to file formal complaints any time there are multiple complaints against one individual, regardless of whether alleged victims want to pursue formal investigation.
The Association of American Universities — of which Harvard is also a member — published its own critique of the new rules Jan. 24.
The AAU also took issue with the mandated live hearings — which it called “quasi-courts” — and argued the new rules encroach on universities' ability to handle Title IX investigations under their own discretion.
The change represents an “unprecedented infringement on universities’ autonomy and expertise,” the AAU wrote.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote in a Dec. 6 statement that he “will not rest until Harvard has done all that it can to prevent sexual and gender-based harassment and assault.”
Rather than offer a concrete response to the guidance himself, however, Bacow said in an interview that Harvard would send its official views through university coalitions, rather than on its own.
Our Harvard Can Do Better, a campus anti-sexual assault advocacy organization, circulated and delivered an open letter that denounced the DeVos rules when they were initially released.
Rebecca N. Thrope ’22, an organizer in Our Harvard Can Do Better, said the group has been working with other student organizations on campus to submit comments to the Department, but was pleased with the University’s response.
“We are very impressed with and thankful for the leadership that Harvard has taken on the issues of sexual assault and gender-based harassment,” Thrope said.

Harvard Law Professor and Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. sent an email to Winthrop students and resident tutors Friday defending his decision to represent former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his Manhattan sexual abuse case.
Sullivan sent the missive to Winthrop affiliates late Friday night, writing that he had heard some residents had concerns about about his decision to represent Weinstein.
“It has come to my attention that a few of you have questions and a few others have concerns in regard to my most recent representation,” Sullivan wrote. “I shall take this opportunity to say a word to our community about the nature of criminal defense in the United States.”
Sullivan also announced he would be holding office hours on Monday and Tuesday night for anyone with questions or concerns.
“Winthrop has been and will remain a space that welcomes all points of view,” Sullivan wrote. “Free, frank and robust dialogue is the best way to clear up any confusions.”
Sullivan wrote more broadly about representation in the United States, writing that “every citizen charged with a crime is cloaked with the presumption of innocence.”
His email mentioned his own work, including his time as a public defender and his past experience representing students at Harvard. Last spring, Sullivan represented a black College student after his arrest by Cambridge Police sparked allegations of police brutality. Charges were ultimately not filed against the student.
Sullivan’s email — which stretches more than 1,200 words over 13 paragraphs — focused on the history and nature of criminal defense. His message centered on the importance of representing the “unpopular defendant.”
“It is particularly important for this category of unpopular defendant to receive the same process as everyone else – perhaps even more important,” Sullivan said. “To the degree we deny unpopular defendants basic due process rights we cease to be the country we imagine ourselves to be.”
Kenard G. Dillon II ’20, a junior in Winthrop House, said he was “very shocked” by the news and was disappointed that he first heard of Sullivan’s new case from the media rather than from Sullivan himself.
“One thing in the aftermath that I’m personally upset about is that speaking with tutors and my resident dean, basically everyone found out through The Crimson’s report or other reporting in the news,” Dillon said. “There was nothing that was said from his end before the news broke.”
Dillon also added that he was not satisfied with the email, saying the message appeared to be “trying to clean up some of the mess from not having spoken about it.”
“I think overall I understand that Ron’s job is as a criminal defense attorney, but also his job is Faculty Dean of Winthrop House,” Dillon said.
Sullivan did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night.
Weinstein faces five charges in a Manhattan sexual abuse trial as a result of allegations that he raped one woman and forcibly performed oral sex on another. The trial is set to begin May 7.
On Friday, Justice James M. Burke approved Sullivan’s appointment to Weinstein’s legal team alongside attorneys Jose Baez and Pamela Mackey, but warned Weinstein of a potential conflict of interest between Sullivan, Baez, and actress Rose A. McGowan.
Sullivan and Baez represented the actress in her 2017 Virginia drug possession case. She also publicly accused Weinstein of rape in Oct. 2017.
Burke said Sullivan and Baez would not be allowed to cross-examine McGowan or use any information from their previous case if she is called to testify against Weinstein.

Massachusetts General Hospital — Harvard Medical School's largest teaching hospital — will construct a 12-story building to accommodate more patients and give healthcare providers access to additional medical technology, the hospital announced last week.
The new building, slated to be 1 million square feet, will add approximately 450 private patient rooms, as well as operating rooms, exam rooms, a procedural suite, imaging facilities, and infusion centers, according to a memo sent to MGH staff Tuesday. Construction will start in 2020.
MGH President Peter L. Slavin ’79 said in an interview that hospital leadership decided to construct a new building because the current MGH facility is overcrowded and does not have enough private rooms to accommodate patients admitted to the hospital. The emergency department faces the same issues, according to Sally Mason Boemer, the hospital’s senior vice president for administration and finance who is overseeing the project.
Hospital administrators decided to pursue the construction project to accommodate more patients while preserving their “privacy and dignity,” Boemer said.
“If you had another roommate right next to you, would you be as forthcoming with your provider about personal information?” Boemer said.
MGH patients will not be the only ones to benefit from the new building; the construction project will also help medical staff as they deliver team-based patient care, Boemer said.
“We need more huddle spaces, whether it’s huddling with family members or huddles with other care providers,” she said. “It’s such team-based care today.”
While the current facilities “tie one arm of our staff behind its back,” Slavin said he hopes the new building will improve medical care delivery and the staff’s working environment.
“I think there will also be space to help some of our workers, in their down time, relax and focus on the quality of their life,” he said. “There’s a big problem with burnout among healthcare workers, and we need to figure out ways, in the space that we design for healthcare in the future, how we can counteract that to some degree.”
Hospital leaders anticipate MGH staff will have to care for increasingly large numbers of patients in coming years.
“Right now in the United States there are about 40 million Medicare beneficiaries, people over the age of 65,” Slavin said. “In 20 years, that number will be 80 million, so there’s going to be a lot more heart disease and cancer and other problems associated with aging that people typically turn to hospitals for help with.”
The number of MGH patients might also rise because other local hospitals, including Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital, have planned or are already undergoing similar renovations — which Slavin said he anticipates will bolster Boston’s status as a hub for medical care and, as a result, draw more patients to Boston-area hospitals including MGH.
“We have an opportunity to attract many more patients from around the country and around the world to receive care,” he said. “I think these buildings will put us in a much more competitive position to do that.”
Hospital leaders said they hope the first stage of the construction will be completed in 2023, and the entire project will be finished by 2026, according to the note sent to MGH staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While some college students tanned on tropical beaches or raced down ski slopes, students who stayed at Harvard during winter break faced sparse social programming and Harvard University Health Services closures.
Roughly 150 College students — many of whom are athletes, international students, or students with unsafe home environmetns — stayed on campus, according to Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01. Campus services normally available during the semester closed briefly during the break, though one organization — the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Foundation — ramped up its programming for students.
The College’s Housing Office coordinates with students whose applications to stay are approved. This year, University officials also responded to several "immediate need situations” and covered unanticipated travels plans, Brandt wrote in an emailed statement.
Between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day, students seeking health services on campus had limited options. Though HUHS Urgent Care remained open throughout break, most of the health services offices were shuttered for the holidays.
Counseling and Mental Health Services was closed for the beginning of winter recess, though students seeking help could speak to an on-call urgent care provider.
Harvard University Dining Services also curtailed their operations. Dining halls closed on the last day of finals in December and did not begin to re-open until early January, starting with Currier House. The College gave students a stipend in the form of Crimson Cash, which students can use at 15 local restaurants, to tide them over this year — as it has done in previous years.
Scattered across campus dorms and Houses, students said they had limited opportunity for social interaction. New this year, however, was a pilot program run by members of the Roosevelt Foundation, which organized outings and events over winter break. The foundation, based at Adams House, maintains a museum of Roosevelt’s time at Harvard and seeks “to use the Roosevelt legacy to address pressing domestic and international problems.”
Executive Director Michael D. Weishan ’86 wrote in an email over the foundation's mailing list that the organization coordinated board game nights, a trip to New Bedford, and walks along the Freedom Trail. Weishan’s email also informed affiliates that the foundation raised money to send two students home for the holidays — one to California and another to England.
Though several students pointed to the foundation’s work, they said the period remained lonely and isolated. James A. Bedford ’20 — who has spent three breaks on campus — called it “miserable.”
“During the Christmas-New Year’s period, there are actually a surprising number of students who are on campus. Just nobody knows that anybody else is on campus,” Bedford said. “You don’t normally see many people. I remember seeing nobody for about a week and a half.”
Bedford, who helped advise the Roosevelt Foundation on its winter programming, called the events “very successful” at improving break for some students.
Brian Warner ’20 — who has also spent each winter break on campus — said winter break is an expectedly lonely time at Harvard.
“It’s not that bad because I get to stay in my room,” Warner said. “I guess I don’t have a high standard for it because I expect to be relatively alone for a month and then people start coming back.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ninety-two percent of respondents to a survey conducted among Graduate School of Arts and Sciences students said they are satisfied with their advising, according to a press release posted on the GSAS website Jan. 22.
The survey also revealed that 87 percent reported satisfaction with the quality of instruction inside their academic program. GSAS surveyed all second-year students and above during the 2018 fall registration period. The survey — which focused on “quality of instruction,” “experience with advisors,” “professional development opportunities,” and “knowledge and utilization of resources” — received a response rate of 93 percent.
GSAS Dean Emma Dench said in the press release that she plans to focus her efforts on improving the quality of academic advising. She added that preserving and improving the quality of advising at GSAS is one of the school’s most critical concerns.
“I am making advising a priority of my tenure as dean and will be launching a project over the next year that will investigate advising methods and develop expectations for the most effective practices,” Dench said.
GSAS administrators will also be working to increase access to and knowledge about non-academic careers within the graduate student community, according to the press release. The survey found that 54 percent of respondents reported receiving encouragement to explore non-academic careers from their department.
Administrators will work to address the lack of exposure to non-academic opportunities by continuing their work with the Office of Career Services to create programming that promotes the visibility of such careers, according to the press release.
Eighty percent of students said they achieved a satisfying work/life balance, and 90 percent said their advisors helped them achieve this.
Concerning professional development, 74 percent reported receiving “excellent or good assistance” in developing professional skills. Satisfaction for opportunities in fieldwork and laboratory assignments is also high, reported at 76 percent and 79 percent, respectively.
Survey results also revealed that respondents are more likely to contact peers than department faculty or administrators when faced with questions concerning GSAS policies and procedures. GSAS Dean of Student Affairs Garth O. McCavana said in the press release that the survey results show administrators must encourage students to engage more frequently with the school’s staff and resources.
“What these results show is that we have to increase our outreach and encourage students to connect with GSAS,” McCavana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After facing two setbacks in a tough slate of conference games last weekend, Harvard traveled to upstate New York to face a pair of ECAC foes in No. 5/5 Clarkson and St. Lawrence. Despite dropping the first game in close fashion, the Crimson rebounded with a tie in the latter to claim a point in the road trip.
HARVARD 0 ST. LAWRENCE 0
Despite the lack of goals, Harvard did not experience a lack of chances. The Crimson generated 29 shots on goal in Saturday afternoon’s contest and earned six power play opportunities. With 28 seconds remaining in the overtime period, the Saints took a tripping minor, setting up Harvard with an opportunity for late-game heroics. After winning the next draw, however, the Crimson could not turn the possession into a last-second scoring chance. St. Lawrence would go on to take one more shot on goal, but that too was turned aside by Harvard junior goalie Beth Larcom. The teams would finish as they had started — scoreless.
“We actually had a lot of chances, but unfortunately, a couple of bounces didn’t go our way,” said co-captain and forward Kate Hallett. “We continued to just pour on the pressure and get pucks to the net.”
Although its offense could not find the back of the net, the Crimson rediscovered its traditional strength on the season with stellar defensive play and goaltending. Notably, Larcom appeared in only her second game of the season — her first appearance since a 34-save performance against Cornell in October. Facing 33 shots from the Saints offense, she proved to be up for the challenge, turning away all of them.
“Regardless of past games, she was ready to play,” Hallett said. “One of the things that we focus on is that, whenever your name is called, just be ready because you never know when that is going to be...Beth really stepped up, owned her role, and showed her ability to compete, bounce back, and always be ready. So we’re really proud of her, and she really played lights out.”
St. Lawrence matched Harvard’s defensive intensity as senior goalie Grace Harrison stymied the Crimson’s 29 shots. Outside of goaltending, the Saints defensive core also supplied 28 blocked shots compared to Harvard’s ten. In other statistics, the teams performed similarly, with St. Lawrence taking 12 penalty minutes compared to the Crimson’s ten and the Saints out-dueling Harvard narrowly at the faceoff dot, 33-29.
Going forward, an ongoing theme for Harvard persists — not necessarily generating chances, but burying them.
“I think it starts in practice,” Hallett said. “If you’re not scoring goals in practice, you’re not going to score goals in games. So I think [the key is] just emphasizing a need to stay hungry and to get to the net and to get bodies to net [and] the idea that every shot on net is a good shot—focusing on taking those smart shots hopefully to either score or produce a good angle for a second opportunity at the net.”
CLARKSON 4 HARVARD 2
Going against the fifth-ranked team in the country, the Crimson faced a two-goal deficit in the late second period. Down 3-1, about to head into the second intermission, Harvard would soon have a chance to regroup and build on the momentum of holding the Golden Knights scoreless for over 15 minutes of game play. With just 58 seconds remaining in the middle period, however, Clarkson would find the back of the net to take a commanding 4-1 lead.
“Whoever has the momentum towards the end of the period, it’s usually big,” Hallett said. “It’s easier then to carry on to the next period with that same momentum. However, we kind of took it as an opportunity to hopefully strike back and to actually come back with more energy than they have.”
Even earlier in the game, the Crimson had shown a willingness to fight back after a Clarkson blow. To begin the contest, Harvard did not get the start it wanted. Playing on the road against a top-five team is already a challenge, and the feat became more difficult as the Golden Knights struck first, taking a 1-0 lead just 3:35 into the game. Despite the setback, the Crimson found its scoring touch almost immediately after the Clarkson tally. On the power play, senior defender Kaitlin Tse rifled a long-range shot past graduate transfer Golden Knight netminder Kassidy Sauve to equalize the score at one.
“One of our mentalities this year has been to always act as if every rink in which we play is our own and just kind of come in and take over as though we do have the home-ice advantage,” Hallett said. “So, I think [we] just kind of [tried] continuing to push forward despite being down by one and not deflating but rather using it as fuel to continue to go.”
Before the first period came to a close, Clarkson would add a second goal on a power play of its own. Building off their momentum in the latter part of the first frame, the Golden Knights added a third goal in the first four minutes of the second. For the next stretch of game play, the two squads traded chances as neither offense found the back of the net until Clarkson’s critical final-minute strike that closed the second period.
Facing the 4-1 deficit, the Crimson did push back in the third, putting together a strong final period just as it had in the pair of losses last weekend. With 2:25 left on the clock, co-captain and forward Lexie Laing (who also went 20-27 at the faceoff dot) sniped the puck top-left corner after tic-tac-toe passing from junior forward Kat Hughes and freshman forward Kristin Della Rovere.
“I think we just decided that there were certain areas in which we needed to tighten up our game,” Hallett said. “It was not due to a lack of effort that the score was 4-1 going into the third period...Rather there were just a couple of errors that we didn’t tighten up, and we recognized that going into the third and did so.”
The Golden Knights, however, would sustain Harvard’s late push and earn their 19th victory of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The IIHF U18 Women’s World Championship gold medal game, between the U.S. and Canada, remained deadlocked at two after three periods. The Americans had held a 2-1 lead in the second-half of the third period, but with 8:49 left on the clock, Canada found the equalizer.
A minute and a half into the sudden-death overtime period, the Canadians would go on to seal the gold, giving the U.S. a silver medal in the Americans’ first loss of the tournament. As the team’s captain, returning to the tournament for a third year and looking to defend her previous two gold medals, Harvard freshman forward Dominique Petrie saw the result unfold firsthand.
“Obviously, the result is not what we wanted, and it’s a hard one to swallow,” Petrie said. “But, looking back on it, you’re going to learn more from how you respond to what happened in a loss rather than in a win, and I know that I speak for myself, and probably a lot of my teammates as a well, it kind of just fuels our fire more.”
Before coming to Harvard or playing on any U.S. national team, Dominique Petrie fell in love with hockey when she first put on skates. Growing up in her home state of California, however, opportunities were at times limited, especially in women’s programs.
“There wasn’t a lot of women’s hockey at the time,” Petrie said. “Growing up, I played boys hockey all the way through, up until last year. I have been very fortunate in that a lot of my teammates now are going off and playing DI men’s college hockey and are prospects for the NHL Draft.”
Petrie made the most of her opportunities though, and her experience as a hockey player has come full circle in that she is opening up opportunities for young players in her position. Icewomen like Petrie are groundbreakers for the growth of hockey, particularly in “non-traditional markets.” In fact, the USA Hockey actually selected Southern California as its location for the U18 pre-tournament camp around new year’s weekend, and the team’s presence was tangible.
“These events are huge — the amount of fans that we had at practices and at a scrimmage against a boys’ team out in LA,” explained Maura Crowell, coach of the U18 national team and Minnesota-Duluth. “Being at the rink [spectators] and watching us practice and play, that’s critical. It’s one thing to talk about it, but it’s another thing to see it live and get to meet some of these players...Our players feel good when little girls look up to them as role models, and obviously the little girls feel great about it too.”
After a successful youth career, complete with state and league championships in California, Petrie arrived at Harvard as only a 17-year-old — not turning 18 until this month. Being younger than the vast majority of her classmates, however, meant she was still eligible to play on the U18 squad, offering the stars and stripes the unique expertise and perspective of a player who had been through a Division-I weight room and seen the mental preparation required at the collegiate level.
“We obviously have some of the best talent in the country on that team, but when you can get a player, especially a three-year veteran, also your captain, who’s playing Division-I hockey at Harvard in one of the best leagues against some of the best competition, it’s honestly invaluable,” said Crowell. “It shows up in the way that she plays...but also in the way that she prepares.”
Being the oldest player on the team was something new for Dominique this season, but she stressed that her on-ice role remained the same. From beyond just a physical standpoint, although she brought the expertise of a two-time defending champion, she stressed that younger players taught her as much as she could help them.
“But even on a national team, being an older player, I’m still learning from the younger players and seeing what they bring to the table and what I can do myself because you always can get better,” said Petrie. “I’m picking their brains; they’re picking my brains.”
Petrie’s status as the team captain traces back to before the tournament as she was named the national team captain for a series with Canada in August. Her experience as a college athlete and returning player served a major role, but more innate skills also factored in to the team’s decision to select her.
“Dom was named captain at that time [August] at that event,” said Crowell. “I think she’s a natural leader...I think she commands respect by the way she goes about her business. She prepares well, focuses well, is serious about her craft, but also is fun too.
Dom can relate to a lot of different people on the team — not just one group — and I think that personality and versatility is important when you’re putting together a team.”
In her leadership responsibilities, Petrie faced a series of obstacles. Although many of the team members had played with each other before in USA camps, showcases, and World Championships, the 2019 squad was officially named in December, being forced to gel in only a couple of weeks with only one mini-camp to prepare before leaving for Japan.
Upon arriving, the team would have to contend with jet lag and a jam-packed game schedule. Petrie’s biggest challenge as a leader, however, may have come after the tournament, in the moments after the the U.S.’s heartbreaking overtime defeat.
“I think Dom and Katy, her assistant captain, did a great job through the tournament keeping everyone level-headed,” said Crowell. “I don’t think that changed at the end. I think they were the same exact way.”
Going forward, Petrie’s focus will return to the Crimson and the remainder of the team’s ECAC schedule. That being said, although she has aged out of the U18 program, her future with USA Hockey is not over yet.
“She’s certainly a big part of the USA Hockey program,” said Crowell. “[Petrie’s] focus is playing great at Harvard and continuing to put herself on the radar for the next event [U22 summer camp].”
With her past at USA Hockey, Petrie should be a player to watch for the U22 summer events. Outside of winning gold medals of her own, Petrie’s USA Hockey dreams started as she watched former U.S. Women’s Olympics teams, most notably the 2018 team’s gold-medal triumph in a shootout. Her goals for the future aren’t very different.
“You hear a lot of people say, growing up, ‘I want to play on the Olympic team,’” Petrie said. “But, for me — yeah you want to play on the Olympic team — but a big thing is I want to win an Olympic gold medal. I think that a lot of little girls dream about that just as much as I do, and you never want to lose to Canada. Having lost to them, it really is a hard one to swallow, and I think that, for anyone that gets that opportunity after being in the experience, you kind of learn from it and realize you don’t want that experience again.”

Stores close, weather turns even worse, but that’s not the only way Harvard has changed while you were gone this winter. I’ve been reliably informed that there are two new official tools to help you decide what classes to take as we hurtle into shopping week! (I say “reliably informed” and not “told by Mike Burke” because apparently I deleted his email.) One is Syllabus Explorer, which looks like a refined version of the my.harvard Search function. The other is Curricle, which is still in beta mode and is also supposed to...do that same thing? Since it’s possible that, like this writer, you missed these tools, Flyby has the deets on how they work and whether you should try them out.
Search Syllabi
The most valuable thing is Syllabus Explorer’s ability to search, well, syllabi of all the classes here running back a few years. If you’ve always wanted to study a specific topic, writer, or piece of work but struggled to find something related to it in the course catalog, this is a much easier way to go about it. Of course, the moment I had Syllabus Explorer pulled up I forgot everything I’ve ever wanted to study… so it’s only as effective as you are. And the more specific you are, the better. A search for “feminism” calls up the top 214 results, and though some of those aren’t available this semester that’s still a lot to go through.
Sort by Semester
It’s not immediately obvious that Syllabus Explorer also allows you to look at your search results, but you can click on ‘Term’ to sort as most recent first. There will still be quite a few pages to click through, if you have a vague or broad query, but it’s better than the default, which sorts by relevance.
Similar Classes?
Another cool function Syllabus Explorer has is that it can suggest similar classes to any one you look up. If you have a certain thread you want to return to in your noble academic quest, this seems like a great way to find more classes on the same subject. It’s unclear on what basis the website deems classes to be similar, but it looks believable enough.
Mike Burke, What is Curricle?
You might wonder why most of this article has touched on Syllabus Explorer and not Curricle. This is because the latter is...perplexing. 
It has some cool graphics, and it is still in beta, but it’s unclear how helpful it’ll be. A lot of it is certainly interesting data — like the instructor networks tab — but it’s not immediately useful in terms of shopping week. Watch that space, maybe?
Harvard seems to have finally heard our complaints about the archaic loading times of my.harvard, but the search for a replacement may not be as straightforward as it seems. Good luck out there this shopping week!
