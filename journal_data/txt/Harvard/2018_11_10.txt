After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, faculty, alumni, and community members from the Boston area filed into Sever 113 for a film screening of Disney Pixar’s “Coco” on Thursday, Nov. 1. The screening preceded a Q&A session with Academy Award-winning producer Darla K. Anderson and lead cultural consultant Marcela Davison Avilés ’80. The event was sponsored by Adams House, the Harvard University Department of Romance Languages, the Cultural Agents Initiative at Harvard, and the Office for the Arts. For many audience members, the event was a fun and enlightening way to engage in the Mexican holiday Día de Muertos (Oct. 31 to Nov. 2) by learning about the cultural significance of “Coco” and some of the behind-the-scenes processes involved in the making of the film.
Before the movie screening, Senior Preceptor in Romance Languages and Literatures María Luisa Parra-Velasco gave a short introduction to the cultural context of the film. “It is wonderful, in particular at this time, to see a beautiful and powerful Mexican story being told the right way,” she said. “When my students and I have discussed this movie, we all notice the care with which Mexican culture is being presented. But what is culture, and what is Mexican about it?” To answer this question, Parra-Velasco told the audience a few things to look out for to see how Mexican culture is presented in the film: the visuals, the characters’ interactions with each other, the food, the music, and the importance of remembering to keep loved ones alive in the world of the dead.
After the screening, audience members had the chance to ask Anderson and Davison Avilés questions. The two discussed the inspiration behind the film, the significance of music as a storytelling device in Mexican culture, and the film’s role in amplifying a community’s voice.
“It was an opportunity to tell a story about something that was part of my culture, that would be told in a way that would be relevant to people outside of my culture, and to be heard for once,” Davison Avilés said. “The end result was a kind of flipping of that power dynamic of who gets to tell a story and who doesn't get to tell a story. We got to tell our story and own our story.”
Davison Avilés also spoke about what she thought made “Coco” a special film. “This was a film that was a combination of a story within mythology, as opposed to fantasy,” she said. “Mythology is part of culture, and culture is part of identity. Culture informs identity.”
Anderson talked about the process of working with cultural consultants to create “Coco,” and how the task required a combination of efforts of many people — not just cultural consultants, but also musicians and other community members in Mexico. “We had to be very vulnerable. We brought quite a few people in, which we’ve never done before, but then it turned out to be the best ever thing.”
Larimar Fuentes, a clinical research coordinator at the Massachusetts General Hospital, was an audience member at the event. “As a Hispanic, I feel attached to [Día de Muertos] culturally, so I wanted to be involved with it in some sort of way, and I thought this was a really great way to do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just over a minute left in the game, Northeastern’s Donnell Gresham was trapped outside the three-point line, smothered by Harvard freshman guard Spencer Freedman. As the shot clock ticked under three seconds, the redshirt junior elevated and sunk a deep triple. That bucket, which extended the Huskies lead to eight, proved to be the nail in the coffin for the Crimson.
It was an appropriate ending on a night when Harvard (1-1) struggled mightily to defend the three-point line, dropping its first game of the season by a 81-71 mark at home to crosstown rival Northeastern (1-1). For the second straight season, the Huskies dispatched the Crimson in large part due to a remarkable performance by George Washington transfer Jordan Roland.
After sitting out last season, the redshirt junior came off the bench to score a career-high 35 points in his second game at Northeastern, knocking down a career-high 7-of-10 three-pointers, and hitting 10-of-11 from the charity stripe. Northeastern coach Bill Coen was thrilled with Roland’s performance Friday night, exalting the Syracuse, N.Y., native’s skill set.
“[Roland]’s a young man that just has a natural gift to score the ball, he’s got a strange combination of elite quickness and deep shooting range,” Coen said. “He’s got that kind of mindset where once he sees the ball get in the basket he can go on a roll. He’s a microwave in that way.”
Roland wasn’t the only Husky to find success beyond the arc, as the visitors scored 39 of their 81 points from three-point land at an impressive 56.5 percent clip. Northeastern repeatedly exposed Harvard’s perimeter defense, relying heavily on skip passes and ball screens to find Roland and other shooters.
Roland’s play was integral in helping the Huskies extend their lead late in the second half. A back-and-forth affair had the Crimson trailing by as few as three points with just over two minutes left in the game. But ultimately, Harvard proved unable to string together enough stops as Northeastern scored a whopping 48 points in the second half, and pulled away in the dying minutes of the game.
The Huskies performed excellently at the charity stripe as well, punishing the hosts for committing fouls. Northeastern converted on 20 of its 22 free throw attempts, which helped the visitors seal the game late.
“Our defense has to get tougher and they have to understand how hard it is each possession in order to be a winning basketball program,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker of the team’s performance. “We had some big plays, but we didn’t get the defensive stops we needed.”
The Crimson led for almost all of the first half, as the first 20 minutes proved to be a series of runs for both teams. After Gresham sunk a jumper on the first possession of the game, Harvard rattled off a 7-0 run capped by a Christian Juzang three-pointer. A pair of three-pointers by Freedman off the bench stretched the Crimson’s lead to double-digits, but the Huskies would respond with a 14-0 run of their own, with the exclamation marks coming on two Roland three-pointers on consecutive possessions.
Like it did on Tuesday against MIT, Harvard ran into foul trouble early in the game. Highly touted freshman Noah Kirkwood entered the game off the bench, and committed three fouls within the span of 36 seconds, forcing Juzang to play 19 of 20 first-half minutes. The junior guard led the Crimson with 35 minutes, and will figure to factor heavily into the team’s plans until Bryce Aiken returns from injury. The Tarzana, Calif., native was displeased with his team’s defense in Friday’s contest.
“35 points is not acceptable,” Juzang said. “The energy is good, but it can only get greater after something like this when you now know the consequences of when you don't lock down on the defensive end.”
As the first half drew to a close, Harvard’s sophomore guard Rio Haskett entered the three-point shooting fray, knocking in two deep triples of his own. The Richmond, Va., native had eight first-half points to lead the Crimson, who managed to knot the score up at 33 entering halftime. Haskett would finish with 15 points as Harvard’s second-leading scorer.
“I thought Rio played hard I thought he really competed, he certainly shot the ball well,” Amaker said. “I thought his play was one of the reasons we were within striking distance.”
Junior forward Chris Lewis led the Crimson with 17 points, and played an integral role in keeping Harvard in the game late. Just as Northeastern opened up an eight-point lead, its largest of the game at that point, Lewis scored seven unanswered points on consecutive possessions — including a steal and full-court breakaway for a dunk.
The Alpharetta, Ga., native’s play was one of a few bright spots for the Crimson, but even Lewis struggled late in the game when double-teamed far away from the basket. Despite the final result, coach Coen was impressed by the 6’ 9” forward’s performance and the maturity he exuded.
“[Lewis] is a tremendous low post player, he scores the ball easily,” Coen said. “What I really like about him is he never changes his demeanor. There's a lot of players going on him, guys playing physically, but he's always controls his emotions, he's got a great demeanor.”
The season remains young, with a challenging series of road games looming in the non-conference portion of the schedule. As the Crimson look to establish its identity without juniors Aiken and Seth Towns, the team will have to continue to correct the little mistakes.
Through two games, Harvard has struggled to control these errors, from offensive rebounding and turnovers against MIT, to foul trouble and perimeter defense against the Huskies. Amaker and the Crimson will hope to improve in these areas, and solidify the foundation of what Harvard hopes will be an Ivy Championship-winning season.
The Crimson will travel to Amherst for its first road game of the season to take on the University of Massachusetts next Tuesday at 7:00pm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the first time in school history, No. 6 Harvard field hockey (17-1) earned an NCAA tournament win and will advance to the NCAA quarterfinals. This was its first victory after five losses in previous tournament berths, beating No. 9 Penn State (12-6) in the inaugural meeting between these two programs.
The Crimson’s resilience was a significant contributor to its dominant performance. First year goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo, whose defensive efforts were critical in the win, remarked on the team’s fierce mentality heading into the game.
“Everyone was determined today and everyone had faith that if we worked that little bit harder over the field and trust the game plan we had set out, we would be fine,” Shahbo said. “The team just had so much grit and determination to win, especially when we put our mind to it.”
Harvard demonstrated its tough mentality from the outset of the game. It secured initial momentum with early saves from Shahbo and scored two goals within the first few minutes of the game. Head Coach Tjerk van Herwaarden recognized the importance of having an aggressive mentality at the beginning of the game.
“You never know what they’re going to bring in the beginning,” van Herwaarden said. “We were able to withhold pressure from them in the first 10 minutes. We got a critical boost from our first two goals.”
The first goal came after a superb defensive play by first year midfielder Rachel Greenwood. The England native intercepted a Penn State pass and found senior forward Kathleen Young, who fed junior forward Maddie Earle for a score right in front of the net.
A mere 23 seconds later, Harvard had its second goal of the game after sophomore forward Tessel Huibregtsen had a great run into the circle to set up a powerful shot by junior forward Bente van Vlijmen.
The Crimson’s offensive flurry would not stop there. Having already had a defensive play that set up their first goal, Greenwood exhibited her two-way versatility with an array of shifty moves as she weaved through the Nittany Lion defense. She then scored on a reverse stick shot to put Harvard up by three.
In less than five minutes, what was once a 0-0 defensive battle turned into a Harvard offensive showcase that resulted in a sizeable 3-0 lead for the Crimson. Although Penn State would soon score off a penalty corner, Harvard had a comfortable 3-1 lead heading into the half.
Despite being up by two, the Crimson remained aggressive with its scoring attack and played relentless defense to prevent the Nittany Lions from having any chance of posing a comeback threat. A spectacular run by Huibregtsen from the near sideline led to a low hard shot into the cage. Then freshman forward Olivia Hoover corralled a long pass from senior back Olivia Allin to score and make it 5-1.
With these two quick scores, Harvard put the game out of reach and cruised to victory the remainder of the game. At the very end, Young put the exclamation point on the Crimson’s first ever NCAA tournament win with a goal at the last minute.
A strong component of Harvard’s domination not only during this game but throughout the season has been their impeccable teamwork and camaraderie. Coach Tjerk alluded to the unity amongst the team as an integral part of its historic run.
“I think the connection amongst these girls is truly amazing, they’re willing to sacrifice a lot for their teammates,” van Herwaarden said. “The senior class is full of great leaders. They’re able to do the work and set the pace, and everyone follows them.”
Having already made history, this Crimson team can continue to rewrite the record books by securing a win in its quarterfinal match against No. 3 Princeton (14-4). They have already beaten the Tigers on its home field thanks to a strong defense that only allowed one goal to a Princeton team which had been averaging over three a game. Freshman phenom goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo will have to continue to be a stalwart for the Crimson to have the defensive presence necessary to advance to the semifinals.
Look for Harvard’s road to a national championship to continue on Sunday at 1 pm where it hopes to oust the Tigers and make history once again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — After a wild night at Yale on Friday ended in a dissatisfying draw, the Harvard men's hockey team (0-2-2, 0-2-2 ECAC) is still in search of a tick in the win column as it faces off against Brown (1-3-1, 1-2-1) on Saturday night.
After another effective performance last night, the Crimson's line of sophomore Henry Bowlby and freshmen Jack Drury and Casey Dornbach has been broken up tonight — but only due to injury. Although unconfirmed by the team, Bowlby appears to be on the shelf tonight after sustaining a gruesome hit on Friday evening.
Nevertheless, Drury and Dornbach remain viable options, and Harvard will continue to rely on other sources of productivity, namely co-captain Lewis Zerter-Gossage and a handful of puck-moving defensemen such as junior Adam Fox and freshman Jack Rathbone.
