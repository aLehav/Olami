After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney officially accepts the Republican nomination for the presidency tonight in Tampa, thousands of delegates from across the country, dressed in the costumery of their home states, will be on hand to cheer him on.
Romney's adopted home state of Massachusetts will be well-represented on the convention floor, but so too will the pages, delegates, onlookers, and even candidates affiliated with Harvard University—a quieter, more loosely defined delegation tied to the Bay State and the presidential hopeful's past. Though in varying capacities and associations, from page to presidential nominee, the traditionally left-leaning University has made its mark on the largest Republican event of the election season.
The most unified of these groups, Harvard College's Institute of Politics, has sponsored several events in Tampa this week, including a forum on politics and the media and a reception for Harvard and IOP affiliates past and present on hand for the convention. The group cancelled a scheduled page lunch because of the convention's abbreviated schedule due to Hurricane Isaac.
“The IOP will hold similar events at next week's Democratic National Convention as it has in conventions past,” said IOP Director C.M. "Trey" Grayson '94.
The convention serves as an opportunity to both reconnect with alumni and to form new relationships with potential future speakers or fellows, according to Grayson.
Back in Cambridge, the IOP hosted watch parties for each of the major convention speeches this week, Grayson said. It will do so again next week, capitalizing on students return to campus to jump-start political activities.
"It is a kick-off for us. This is where the timing with the beginning of the semester actually helps," Grayson said.
In Tampa, Grayson said he hopes the IOP can help to bring together what is otherwise a very loose network. While many of the delegates and support staff have Harvard ties, they rarely connect on those grounds, which often go unnoticed.
Stephen E. Dewey '07, a New York software engineer, co-founded the Harvard Republican Alumni Network (HRAN) during the 2008 election cycle to try to change that. The group has since ballooned to 600 members from an initial 50. Dewey stressed that it is not an advocacy group—HRAN has no bank account and is not allowed to collect funds—but it has become a significant networking organization for politically minded Republicans, sponsoring social events and publishing a monthly newsletter with job listings and organization news.
The RNC in Tampa provided the interest group, whose members are scattered across the country, an opportunity to gather under one roof. Of the 22 HRAN members in Tampa this week, Dewey said 12 met for a dinner Monday.
"We primarily exist to serve the alumni," Dewey said. "We're happy to help a campaign if it's running. Our goal is not to push any particular activity, but to help the alumni in whatever they choose to do."
In many cases that means connecting alumni running for office with an interested audience of fellow alums. When Ted Cruz, a Harvard Law School alumnus, declared his candidacy for U.S. Senate in Texas, HRAN organized a conference call for members interested in talking with Cruz. Though no money changed hands, Dewey said the call was a win-win. Interested members had unusual access to a high-profile candidate, and the candidate made his case to a receptive, well-connected audience.
For Republicans still in school, the convention was an opportunity to see political theater up close and rub-shoulders with party leaders. Grayson, who left the convention prematurely Tuesday afternoon to return to Cambridge for freshmen advising, said the timing of this year's party conventions and its conflict with the start of school probably stifled student involvement.
Still, Grayson said he estimates 10 or so current students and recent graduates are at the convention. Grayson said he expects even more students at next week's Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C. The Democrats typically draw a larger crowd than their Republican counterparts, necessitating more pages, aides, and interns, which are roles commonly filled by students.
Katerina Glyptis '14, an IOP Director's intern for the RNC's Committee on Arrangements, is one of those students. She has been in Florida most of the summer in preparation for what Hurricane Isaac whittled down to three speech-filled days. Glyptis spent most of the summer working with the committee's production department, securing credentials, transportation, and hotel rooms for the convention's production staff, in addition to conducting some political research on the side, all in an effort to make the party's biggest showcase look effortless.
Watching the once-empty Tampa Bay Times Forum, home of the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning, transformed into a large television studio, Glyptis said she has been amazed by the amount of work put in long before the delegates and TV cameras show up.
"I'm going to make a point to be out there when I want to be out there," Glyptis said. "It's exciting to see the back of it, but a large portion is standing out there and seeing the completion after weeks of preparation."
Though the summer was not as political as she expected, Glyptis, who identified herself as a Republican, said it was an amazing experience.
"It's something that only happens only once every four years, so I knew I wouldn't have another chance to do something like this while I'm in college," she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren has again outraised Senator Scott Brown in the race for Massachusetts’ junior U.S. Senate seat, raising $3.7 million to Brown’s $2.3 million since July, Federal Election Commission filings show.
This latest infusion of cash brings Warren's race total to a staggering $27.7 million, a figure larger than that of any other congressional campaign in the country. Brown’s own pace—$20.9 million raised since last autumn—is second only his Democratic opponent nationally.
The contest between Brown and Warren has garnered much national attention and triggered an influx of out-of-state cash as both parties fight for the contested Senate seat.
The FEC filings come just a week before Massachusetts’ Sept. 6 primary, when both Brown and Warren will run unopposed and officially win their respective places on the November ballot.
The campaigns have not been shy thus far in putting their money to use. Both Warren and Brown have already spent roughly $15.7 million each on political consultants and advertisements. Brown, who came into the campaign with a reserve of cash left over from his 2010 special election campaign, still has $14.1 million cash on hand, slightly more than Warren's $12.3 million.
Both campaigns signed a pact in January pledging to block third-party spending in the race.
A recent report by the liberal organization Public Policy Polling showed Brown ahead of Warren by five points, leading 49 percent to 44 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Momentum from a strong spring exhibition season seemed to carry over into the Harvard men’s soccer team’s Friday matchup at UMass. But despite dominating possession and outshooting the Minutemen, 19-10, the Crimson (0-1-1) opened its season in a 1-1 deadlock at Rudd Field in Amherst, Mass.
“That was one that we definitely should have won,” said Harvard coach Carl Junot, who is now in his third season at the helm. “I think we did enough to win the game, but couldn’t do enough to pull it out.”
UMass (2-0-1) started the scoring with a goal in the 18th minute by sophomore forward Josh Schwartz off of an assist from junior Connor Devivo. Devivo led Schwartz with a 30-yard through ball, putting Schwartz one-on-one with Crimson freshman goalie Evan Mendez. Schwartz deftly avoided Mendez and put the ball in the back of the net.
But Harvard sophomore Hiroki Kobayashi responded quickly, netting the Crimson’s first goal of the season in the 22nd minute on a lefty shot from 20 yards out.
Kobayashi scored the winning goal in Harvard’s victory over the Haitian national team last spring and is part of a revamped offense that showed signs of improvement over last year’s squad that struggled finding the back of the net at times.
After scoring three goals in the first four games in 2011, the Crimson scored just two in the next eight.
Coming out of the half tied, Harvard applied increased pressure and outshot the Minutemen, 8-2, in the second frame. But it was to no avail, as UMass goalie Brian Frame helped maintain the deadlock and send the Crimson back to Cambridge with a tie.
Youth was the order of the day as four freshmen saw significant minutes in all aspects of the game.
Rookie defender Mark Ashby turned in an impressive performance after starting the game in the middle alongside senior Richard Smith. But a brutal tackle that resulted in a dislocated knee cap midway through the game sidelined him.
The gruesome injury was not as severe as it looked, and Ashby expects to return to the pitch in just over a week’s time.
Starting in net was another fresh face, with Mendez taking over unexpectedly for senior veteran Brett Conrad. Mendez played all 110 minutes of the game, making three saves and allowing the one goal.
“It’s just an opportunity like any other,” Mendez said. “You have to make the best of it.”
Oliver White, the High School Player of the Year in Massachusetts, saw action in the midfield and Jake Freeman, a prodigious goalscorer on the youth soccer circuit, notched two shots on goal.
The introduction to the collegiate playing field has been brisk for the Crimson rookies, but the absence of veterans due in part to injury has made their adjustment a necessity.
“We’re really relying on the young guys this season,” Junot said. “There’s always some risk in that, but so far we like what we’ve seen.”
Last season, Harvard opened its season under the bright lights in front of a sold-out crowd at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium. The Crimson won that game, 1-0, over Northeastern.

Welcome, Class of 2016! All your hard work (or lies) paid off and you should be proud to be a freshman at Harvard. But if you’re not, and are instead ashamed to be once again at the bottom of your school’s caste system, here is some helpful advice for masquerading as an upperclassman.
How to Dress
First, take off your Class of 2016 t-shirt. It is a dead giveaway. You should never wear it. Exception: If going to a final club, you will want to wear it to advertise the fact that you are young and naïve. 
 
Next, ditch the lanyard. Just throw your keys and ID in your backpack. Don’t worry too much about losing your keys, because you won’t need them. Sleeping in the freshmen dorms is another dead giveaway that you're, um, a freshman, so just find a couch in Lamont. Or, if you did FOP, start a new Occupy movement and pitch a tent in the yard. 
 
How to Get Around 
Like wild dogs and cigarettes, freshmen always travel in packs. This ensures that, when they get lost in the desolate wilds of Cambridge, there will always be enough people to breed a new civilization. It is tempting to follow suit, but if you want to look like an upperclassman when you're walking to lunch or class, it is best to walk alone or in pairs. If you are worried about safety you can always carry pepper spray. That should keep the tourists away.
 
And remember, never use your map or ask for directions. Upperclassmen always pretend like they know where they are going, and you should, too. You will probably get lost looking for your classes, but the best thing about shopping week is that you can just interrupt any class and pretend that you actually intended to be there. If you end up stumbling into an upper division math class or a senior tutorial, bonus points!: you will look even older. 
 
How to Talk 
In reality, it is best to keep your speech to a bare minimum—an eagerness to speak is characteristic of all freshmen. Grunts and spastic hand gestures will not only be an appropriate response to most questions, but will make you look cool and indifferent, just like an upperclassman. Some may even assume you’ve spent too much time experimenting with illicit substances, and you know what that means...more upperclassmen cool points.
 
If you're accused of being mute or your roommates threaten to stage an intervention, you may have to say something. So you can prepare to answer the basics. If people ask you what your concentration is, have a minor existential meltdown—they will assume you are a sophomore. If people ask you what you did this summer, tell them you worked on your thesis at the National Archives of Sweden or spread AIDS awareness to elephants in Thailand or something.
 
So congratulations! You may be friendless, homeless, and taking all advanced physics classes, but at least everyone will think you are a lonely, homeless, and (struggling) upperclassman. Which, of course, is preferable to being a freshman.

It’d be possible to spend countless hours talking about why Denton’s music scene is exceptional—the openness to amateurs, the DIY attitude, the high talent density of the town’s population. But the best way to understand what makes Denton special is to just spend a Saturday night there. So that’s what I did. 
8:02 p.m.—Ramen Republic, E Hickory St.
It’s August 11th. I’m in Denton on a Saturday night with Adam Holmes,  my best friend from high school. The drive here is gorgeous—a two-lane  farm-to-market road that meanders through 400-person towns and sprawling  cow pastures.
We meet up with our friend Nick Rothouse, a percussion student at the  University of North Texas who is also in Denton for the evening. Adam  and I catch up with Nick over noodles at Ramen Republic, a mom-and-pop  fast casual diner just off the square.
8:33 p.m.—Banter, W Oak St.
We start our evening at Banter, a small club on Oak Street. We splay  ourselves on big leather couches under a corrugated-steel ceiling. The  evening’s opening act is a blues outfit called Baloney Moon. None of the  quintet’s members are under fifty years old. They’re playing on the  stage of a venue that can’t be bigger than 6 feet by 10 feet.
And they are really good. The lead singer looks as though she  could’ve been my first-grade teacher but she has the voice and the stage  presence of a slightly less bombastic Wynonna Judd. At one point, she  makes eye contact with me, breaks into a huge smile, and gives a little  shimmy as she positively belts out one of the set’s most energetic  songs.
She’s backed up by rhythm instrumentalists who clearly know what  they’re doing; holding back to pull the small but rapt audience in  before throwing down just enough to keep things interesting—but too much  to elicit scoffs.
From where we’re sitting, we can see the street through Banter’s big  glass windows. A young couple, dressed in formal clothes, is dancing  outside in the fading sunlight, the man twirling the woman in time to  Baloney Moon’s whiskey-slick twelve-bar blues.
8:55 p.m.—J&J’s Pizza, W Oak St.
From Banter, Adam, Nick and I head east on Oak Street to J&J’s  Pizza, one of the Square’s mainstays. Upstairs, it’s a standard pizza  joint. Downstairs, it’s a small, shamelessly dingy concert space, with a  claustrophobic low ceiling and just enough floor space to make you  uncomfortable at crowded shows.
We walk down the crooked staircase to a small crowd and a tall,  muscular African-American man gyrating against the microphone. There’s a  portrait of what I’m pretty sure is the Virgin Mary hanging behind the  band, The Gypsy Hideout.
They mostly play energetic jazz-fusion songs with lyrics mostly about  sex. The lead singer is mesmerizing, dancing seductively around the  tiny venue, and ripping open his vest. It’s an energy unfortunately  undeserved by the small space and sparse crowd. But we still have fun.
9:23 p.m.—Denton Courthouse
The three of us emerge from J&J’s and continue east on Oak  Street. We stop by Andy’s Bar, where I interviewed Cameron Neal in my  last article, but tonight there’s a fairly steep cover and we don’t  recognize any of the names. So we take a right and head south on Locust  Street.
On the lawn in front of the town’s courthouse, the centerpiece of  Denton Square, there’s a circle of folk musicians playing instrumental  tunes. Not one of them looks under seventy. We stand there and watch for  a few minutes. Other people stop and watch too.
9:32 p.m.—Dan’s Silverleaf, Industrial St.
From the courthouse, we head off the square, onto Hickory Street. Our  destination is a bar called Dan’s Silverleaf—one of Denton’s premiere  venues.
We pay the cover, but as we have arrived in between sets, the three  of us head outside to the patio. It’s an unnaturally cool evening for  August in Texas (read: below 90 degrees), and plenty of people, most of  them in their mid-twenties, are outside smoking, drinking, and enjoying  each other’s company.
After about thirty minutes, we head back inside to watch Spooky Folk  perform. They’re pretty well known around town, and their unpretentious,  blaring, baroque-folk sound lends itself well to incredible live shows.
“Bible Belt” is a tongue-in-cheek account about growing up in an  oppressively religious community—which, well, aren’t particularly in  short supply around these parts. “I was born on the Bible Belt / give me  something sharp so I can kill myself,” sings the whole band in the  song’s foot-pounding chorus. “‘Cause I can’t go on living this way /  even though my momma says, well, get down on your knees and pray!”
The crowd loves it. They cheer, they whistle, they clap, but it’s  never disproportionate to the energy of the band. That’s another  important thing about Denton: It’s a town of not only talented musicians  but also keen and knowledgeable music appreciators. Both elements are  part of what makes the music culture so vibrant and so consistently  brilliant.
10:51 p.m.—Courthouse
As we walk back up Hickory Street, we pass the courthouse again. This  time, there’s a circle of people playing percussion instruments of  various types. The people, too, are diverse—some old, some young, some  who look like trained percussionists and some who look like they’ve  never touched a drum in their life.
In front of the circle sits a pile of percussion instruments and a sign: “Yes! You may borrow a drum. Or, feel free to dance!”
As the sound of a classical violinist busking across the street  floats to me through the warm air, it occurs to me that this sign  captures Denton pretty well. Sure, the town has its established acts and  its micro-scenes. And if you want to make it, you obviously have to be  good. But outside of that, there really aren’t any rules. In such a  small town, with such a dedicated group of listeners who recognize that  they have something special here, there’s nothing stopping anyone from  picking up a drum—or a guitar, or a keyboard, or a microphone—and  joining in.

Every week, The Crimson publishes a selection of articles that were printed in our pages in years past.
September 1, 1935: First Class of Harvard's Fourth Century Will Have 1050 Members
More than one-third of the members of the new freshman class have signified their intention of returning to the Tercentenary Celebration on September 16, 17, and 18. Special plans for the Class of 1940 are being made and complete living accommodations will be supplied in the Harvard Yard.
September 1, 1939: Would Change "Harvard" To "George Washington Square"
Harvard Square, the traditional name for the district around the University, may be "George Washington" Square if a plan of Cambridge Councilman Michael A. (Mickey the Dude) Sullivan goes through.
Sullivan, a local character who represents the Harvard Square region in the City Council, patriotically resents his ward's being named after John Harvard, who, he says, never set foot in this city.
August 29, 1944: PBH Sponsors Hospital Lectures and Readings
Convalescing tubercular patients at the Cambridge Tubercular Hospital are receiving lectures and participating in discussion groups sponsored by Phillips Brooks House.
September 1, 1972: 200 Freshmen Women To Reside in Yard
The Class of '76 may not know it, but the Harvard Yard they will be living in has undergone some substantial changes this year.
Most noticeable, of course, is the introduction of women. Some 200 freshman women—out of a total Yard population of 1200—will be living in five Yard dorms.
But freshmen expecting to live in a coed entry or floor will be disappointed. Many women who had lived in Harvard Houses where they were greatly outnumbered by men objected to having the freshmen women scattered in small numbers throughout all the entries. They argued that a "critical mass" of women was needed to avoid their feeling overwhelmed. Therefore, women will be isolated in their own entries or floors.
