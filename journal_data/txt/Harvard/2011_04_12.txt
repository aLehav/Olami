After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Misery loves company—so the saying goes, but the opposite is true in Rebecca Hunt’s debut novel, “Mr. Chartwell.” Set in London in 1964, the plot follows two vastly different characters’ struggles with depression: Esther Hammerhans, a young widowed librarian, and former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who at the age of 89 is nearing retirement after a lifetime of public service. Both receive unwanted visits from a mysterious anthropomorphic dog, which preys on their insecurities and at times knows more about them than they do about themselves. Churchill publicly acknowledged his personal battle against depression, which he called the “Black Dog;” Hunt draws her influence from this description, imagining the “Black Dog” as a literal presence in the lives of those suffering from depression.
Yet all is not gloom and doom in this novel centered around one of the darkest human emotions. Instead of crafting descriptions of depression laden with misery, Hunt enlivens the struggles of Esther and Churchill against the Black Dog with witty banter. The dog, who introduces himself to Esther as “Mr. Chartwell” but soon comes to be known as Black Pat, especially enjoys antagonizing Esther with behavior she finds repulsive and annoying.
After littering her yard with bird carcasses he intends to cook on a homemade barbeque grill, Esther asks Black Pat how many birds he killed. “Dum-de-dum,” he answers. “Don’t worry, none you knew personally.”’
Hunt’s prose also shines in her evocative descriptions of everyday emotions and occurrences. “The empty house closed around her like a shroud,” Hunt writes, drawing the reader further into the entrapment Esther experiences every day in her lonely solitude. The first pangs of early romance become, under Hunt’s steady guidance, a “heart [ringing] like a tuning fork.”
The author has a perfect, eloquent way of putting other inane experiences to words. On the first night Black Pat sleeps at Esther’s house, “Esther felt the embarrassment of trying to sleep in the company of acquaintances, that squeak of adult humiliation at talking in pyjamas and then very consciously not talking and lying there in the blackness.”
Hunt aims to permeate the entire book with an air of mystery, and introduces tantalizing questions from the nature of Esther’s husband Michael’s death to the very meaning of Black Pat. However, the solutions to these questions are more obvious than Hunt seems to think they are. Quite early in the novel, Black Pat clearly insinuates that he is the embodiment of depression. When Esther pries into the nature of his employment, he readily explains: “My services consist of periods of time when I visit specific people, people who experience a specific darkness. Churchill is a regular ... He names his depression the Black Dog.” Apparently, Hunt thought this allusion was veiled enough that the reader would not associate Black Pat with the actual experience of depression; even without this quote, however, it is clear from Esther’s personality that she is depressed. So when Esther’s later revelation about Black Pat’s true nature comes to light, her description—“It was the crescendo of a piano heaved from the top of a staircase. The piano hit the floor and detonated with all chords,” seems a slightly overblown given the circumstances of her—and the reader’s—discovery.
However, this slight fault is for the most part inconsequential, and does not interfere with Hunt’s otherwise lively and engaging style. She deftly weaves Black Pat’s overwhelming, constant presence into the novel without sacrificing other plot developments and supporting characters. It is her characterization of Black Pat, with all his nuanced shifts in emotion, which prove her chops as a writer. Black Pat is simultaneously pitiable and vile, charming and insidious. Hunt’s descriptions powerfully encapsulate his cunning character. Having begged Esther to be allowed to sleep in her room, he dejectedly gives up—but only momentarily. “‘But I’m not allowed in,’ he said sadly, so very sorry for himself. ‘You won’t let me in,’ he said again, such a sad dog. There was a subtle transformation, oblongs of streetlight moving across his eyes. He said ... in an inaudible slip of breath, ‘Yet.’”
It is this casual creepiness in Black Pat’s character that results in the novel’s most interesting descriptions. Trying to get Esther to confide in him, his voice is “soft and ulcerous;” talking about the inescapability of depression, he predicts that “back you’ll come because I’ll bring you back.” Alone, the thoughts of Esther and Churchill can be bland and tedious; forced to interact with Black Pat, their personalities come alive in dynamic ways as they spar, verbally and mentally, with the embodiment of their struggles.
“I’m only the grease in a crease,” Black Pat says, “a kink in the link.” Despite this light-hearted take on depression, the novel, by its end, is surprisingly serious about the implications of both depression and recovery. Hunt has crafted an elegant tale that brings depression—so often taboo and hidden—into a personal light by personifying it. Depression, Hunt imparts, is not the be-all, end-all of existence. Churchill led an entire country while struggling with his personal demons. “It’s either my way or the hard way,” Black Pat starts off, in what seems to be one of his characteristic ditties. “But in truth, in time,” he finally admits, “my way is the hardest way imaginable.” In this darkly optimistic first work, Rebecca Hunt presents an intimate and original take on the private destruction of depression.

In her will, a departed mother leaves a message to her grown children regarding a brother they didn’t know they had and a father they thought was dead. So begins the new film from Quebec-born writer and director Denis Villeneuve, “Incendies.” The children are twins Jeanne (Mélissa Désormeaux-Poulin) and Simon (Maxim Gaudette), and they embark on a journey to discover the truth about their family and about their mother’s life. Set against the backdrop of war in the Middle East, “Incendies” is a glorious and powerfully gripping piece, and was recognized as such when it was nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film.
For such an accomplished director, Villeneuve is remarkably self-effacing to the point of bashfulness. “I have to tell you the truth,” he said, “this morning I looked at the schedule and said, ‘oh my God, I’m going to be with someone from Harvard ... that is quite impressive. For me, it has this kind of mythological [appeal].”
From there, conversation flowed freely with this personable man, who had much to say about his movie and about film in general, even as he occasionally struggled with English, his second language after French. The director began with praise for Wajdi Mouawad, the playwright who penned the stage version of “Incendies.”
“I did fall in love with the play,” Villeneuve said. When he decided to construct a screenplay out of it, Mouawad gave him full creative license with the material. “The play was full of very powerful ideas and images but all the images were very theatrical,” Villeneuve continued. “So I did have the freedom to remove even very important characters or scenes ... in order to just get the cinematographic elements.”
In choosing an issue on which to focus, Villeneuve stuck to the old adage: write what you know. “To make a film about the Middle East and war ... I’m a Canadian, I know nothing of that. I did my homework, of course ... but let’s say that my main angle was family,” he said. “For me that was the way I was able to get inside this story. I know war inside a family. I can deal with that. I can talk about it, I will concentrate on the intimacy of the character, and the rest—I will do my best to try for authenticity.”
Thus, despite appearances, “Incendies” is “not a movie about war, it’s about a cycle of anger inside a family.” Villeneuve said. “I do understand that, and I can write about it.”
Villeneuve’s family background wasn’t the only history he drew upon for the movie. To make “Incendies,” Villeneuve returned to his roots as a documentary filmmaker, which among other things inspired him to shoot outside the confines of the studio. “When I started in the studio, it was so comfortable, so controlled,” he said. These convenient confines would not be sufficient to capture the gritty reality he sought. For this reason, Villeneuve and his crew travelled to Jordan to shoot the majority of the film.
Filming on location, for Villeneuve, was invaluable. “We were very welcomed there,” he said. “The country was very generous with us—the people, the landscape ... there was so much possibility over there. There was so much gift from life falling in front of the camera.”
But being in such a beautiful setting was also a challenge: “The danger is to fall into exoticism ... and to be too excited about everything that is new,” Villeneuve said. “I hope we were able to avoid clichés, and too much beauty ... to just concentrate on the dramatic events and not fall into tourism.”
His other strategy for avoiding cinematic excess was humility. “I did try, for this film, ... as a director, to be humble. In my previous films, sometimes I was trying to make a shot that would impress other people,” he said, “but this time I was just trying to tell the story the best that I can as a director. The story was so complicated that I just concentrated on storytelling.”
Of course, it was the film that Villeneuve approached with artistic humility which earned him an Oscar nod.
“I was at Sundance film festival with a bunch of friends, among them my producers,” he recalled. “And when they announced it, I thought we would be very civilized if we were [one] of the five nominees ... that’s not the case. We began to shout everywhere, crying, like a bunch of Halle Berrys.”
The nomination fulfilled a youthful dream. “For me, the Academy Awards are something that belongs to childhood,” he said. “When I was young and wanted to be a director, I was looking at [Francis Ford] Coppola with his Oscar, and it impressed me a lot. And so when it happened ... I was like a six-year-old kid. I was so happy.”
Though Villeneuve holds no illusions about his profession—especially in a market where deeper character dramas seem to be overwhelmed by formulaic blockbusters—he maintains characteristic optimism about its prospects. “Of course there is a lot of Hollywood crap,” he acknowledged. “But there is  [also] a lot of soul.” Perhaps with a few more films like “Incendies,” this talented director will do much to tilt the scales in favor of the latter.

Life is beautiful and full of wonder—but is that enough to change the ways of a child trained as a killer in isolation from all humanity? “Hanna,” a new release from “Atonement” director Joe Wright, provides an answer to this question with a thrilling action movie. Although rife with action sequences and chase scenes that support a pulse-quickening plot, at its heart “Hanna” is a philosophical musing on the perspective-altering power of life’s inherent beauty.
The film opens with Hanna (Saoirse Ronan), a 16-year-old girl, on a moose hunt in northern Finland. The environment mirrors the character inhabiting it; Wright depicts both the harsh, icy landscape and the cold killing machine that Hanna has become at the hands of her father, Erik (a bland but effective Eric Bana). Wright skillfully alternates between stunning panoramic wide shots and intimate close-ups to create a sense of the immense isolation of father and daughter. But even as he underscores the gulf between Erik and Hanna and the rest of civilization, Wright is careful to preserve their humanity. “What does music sound like?” Hanna innocently wonders.
The film’s own music, composed by The Chemical Brothers, perfectly suits the visuals. Its mix of raucous electronica with chillingly sweet melodies complements the alternating bleak and thrilling images onscreen. Its artistic merits are sometimes undermined, however, when the score is mixed in loudly enough to divert attention from the scenes it was meant to augment. The film would have done better to rely less on its soundtrack and more on its compelling storyline.
That plot thickens almost immediately as Hanna’s separation from society is soon brought to an abrupt end. When Erik’s past catches up with him in the form of ruthless CIA investigator Marissa (Cate Blanchett) and he must flee Finland, Hanna departs as well and is finally given an opportunity to satisfy all of her real-world curiosities.
After escaping from a CIA base in Morocco, Hanna finds herself traveling around Europe with a British family and their pop culture-obsessed daughter Sophie, played by Jessica Barden in a hilarious turn. On her journey, Hanna experiences normal teenage life for the first time: she goes on dates with boys in Spain, dances, visits candy shops, and, of course, listens to music. Wright deftly demonstrates Hanna’s fascination with this new life through humorous incidents which highlight the extent of her abnormal upbringing. Yet, despite her oddities, she gains her first friend: Sophie explains to her at one point, “I mean you’re a freak and everything, but I like you.”
Ronan’s performance as Hanna is stunning. She exhibits remarkable control of her facial expressions, often using her eyes to express her astonishment with the world even as the rest of her face reflects her distance from it. The camera frequently circles around Hanna’s head, as if to show that she is constantly surrounded by an invisible barrier that prevents her from truly assimilating into the world around her. But thanks to Ronan’s affecting performance, the audience roots for this assimilation to occur, and for Hanna to overcome her violent tendencies.
“Hanna” is a tour-de-force not only for Ronan, but also for Joe Wright. A celebrated director of such dramas as “Atonement” and “Pride and Prejudice,” Wright here reveals a talent for crafting taut and beautifully-filmed action thrillers. He builds staggering, lengthy, artistic shots that somehow never seem to slow down the action. Instead, art is seamlessly combined with action, making “Hanna” one of the more creatively executed action bonanzas of recent memory. In one paradigmatic scene, Erik battles four CIA agents, and as he does so the camera darts impossibly between the punches and kicks of the melee. Shots like these make “Hanna” superior to many action thrillers: the film relies not on rapid-fire edits for its intensity, but instead draws the viewer into the immediacy of its drama.
What prevents “Hanna” from achieving true greatness is the lazy and contrived nature of its last act, which fails to tie up all of the film’s intriguing strands. Nonetheless, this narrative weakness aside, Wright’s film and Ronan’s performance succeed as a powerful meditation on the question of whether individuals have intrinsic humanity that cannot be wholly excised by even the harshest of circumstances. Adroitly combining this philosophical speculation with some of the most engrossing and original action scenes in theaters, “Hanna” is the rare film that offers a feast for both the eyes and the mind.

“They were freaked out,” James Gunn responded gleefully when asked about the audience’s reaction to the premiere of his new film “Super.” Starring Rainn Wilson, Ellen Page, Liv Tyler, and Kevin Bacon, the film is a serious departure in tone and characterization from most of its cast’s earlier works. As such, this particular audience at the 2010 Toronto Film Festival had no idea that the film they were about to see was a truly dark comedy—with an emphasis on the ‘dark.’
“Super,” Gunn’s second directorial work after 2006’s “Slither,” tells the unexpectedly violent and heartbreaking story of Frank D’Arbo (Wilson) and his quest to rescue his drug-addicted wife (Tyler) from the clutches of an evil drug dealer (Bacon). Frank transforms into a self-invented superhero, “The Crimson Bolt,” and confronts the city streets with grit and bloodlust alongside his sidekick Libby (Page), who names herself “Boltie.”
But the film is far from a traditional entry into the genre. “One of the things about ‘Super,’” Gunn said, “[is that] it’s not really about a superhero. It’s about this guy, his beliefs—what’s right and what’s wrong ... It just so happens that he wears a superhero costume while he goes through that story.”
Yet Gunn did not deny that “Super,” unconventional though it may be, is still a superhero movie, albeit a self-conscious one. “[The film] is a commentary on that, or at least a reaction to that. We see Batman—he puts on a cape and we take for granted that he knows what’s right and what’s wrong, who should get beaten up and who shouldn’t,” he said. “Super,” by contrast, was designed to shake up these preconceptions. “In ‘Super,’ what’s really right? Does he get to beat those people up or not? And why do I like watching him do it?”
Throughout the discussion of his film, Gunn made frequent reference to his love of superhero comics and their movie adaptations. He enjoyed making “Super” as a response to the traditionally clear-cut morals and lack of consequential reality in this genre. “We see these superhero movies where people are blowing up things, punching people, knocking people out, and we don’t really see the ramifications,” he said.
It was this desire for uncomfortable realism that pushed Gunn to make the violence in “Super” so decidedly un-stylized. “We actually see the results of the violence,” he said. In one scene, where Frank attacks a man who cuts in line at the movies, “we see the wrench to the face and the head split open,” instead of Hollywood’s traditional quick knock to the head that tidily renders a villain incapacitated. In real life, noted Gunn, “they stand a 10 percent chance of dying if they get knocked unconscious like that!”
Gunn’s inspiration for playing with the minds of his audience stems from many of his stated cinematic influences—films with harsh violence and ambiguous morals like “Taxi Driver” and “Unforgiven,” as well as those like “Napoleon Dynamite” that champion the unlikely underdog.
Combining these two genres, though, yields an unlikely mix of emotions. In the movie line scene, notes Gunn, “when the guy buts in line, you’re like, ‘I hate this guy, I want to see [Frank] kick his ass.’” But the resulting brutality puts the viewer in an awkward position. “You watch [Frank] really hurting him and you’re like ‘I think I still like it—I feel bad!’” This narrative theme of “rooting for somebody but not really being sure that you should,” as Gunn put it, is constantly at play throughout “Super,” alternatively challenging and discomforting its audience.
Where do these eccentric, damaged, and distinctive characters come from? It turns out that for such an outlandish premise, the characters involved are more personal than one might think.  “Libby is, frankly, like a lot of girls I knew growing up,” said Gunn. “She’s got a lot of issues and yet she’s so dynamic that I love her even though she’s a total sociopath.”
Discussing his inspiration for Frank, the conversation became more somber. “I grew up in a very dysfunctional home, with a lot of violence and stuff,” he said. “I used to get in fights all the time, and that’s a part of me. I relate to Frank. Frank is me, in many ways.”
“No matter what he’s doing in his life, moral or immoral,” Gunn continued, “I believe he has the right motivations. He’s not doing what he’s doing just to hurt people. Libby, on the other hand, is kind of putting on the costume so that she can beat people up. The thing with Frank is he is trying to do the right thing, even if it’s totally wrong.”
Gunn acknowledged that his film’s initial premise—Average Joe decides to become a superhero—bears superficial resemblance to last year’s zany “Kick-Ass.” But Gunn wrote the script for “Super” years before “Kick-Ass” even became a comic book, let alone a film. “I think a lot of people think [‘Super’ is] like ‘Kick-Ass’ before they see it,” Gunn said. But, he added, in light of his film’s darker, more conflicted undertones, “to walk out of the theater and think it’s like ‘Kick-Ass’—there’s something wrong with you!”

Jason Winer’s “Arthur” could be the archetypal case study of arrested development. The titular character, played by Russell Brand, is the neotenous adult, a child trapped in a man’s body with the wealth to live out his wildest fantasies. The basic premise of the film is a familiar one: the juvenile Arthur’s raucous escapades and drunken excesses are juxtaposed with his emotional instability and cast as symptoms of absent parenting. The banality of this well-worn plot, however, is easily counterbalanced by the sardonic comedic chemistry between Brand and his mother-like figure, Nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren). Indeed, the enjoyment one derives from this movie—enough to make audiences erupt in spontaneous bursts of shot-gun giggles—rests on the dry synthesis of the pair who both inhabit and parody the absurdity of their characters.
Arthur Bach is a wealthy playboy who is cared for in every regard by his Nanny, and whose publicized antics have begun to damage the respectability of the Bach family business. In an attempt to curtail Arthur’s extravagant recklessness, his frigid mother (Geraldine James) gives him an ultimatum: either marry maniacal corporate executive Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner) or face being disinherited. At this timely—or untimely—moment, Arthur meets love-to-be Naomi Quinn (Greta Gerwig), whose aspirations to be a children’s book writer seem almost too perfectly suited to Arthur’s pseudo-maturity. What then ensues are days of desperate deliberation, during which Arthur must decide between his inheritance and the girl of his dreams.
Despite the consummate performances of Mirren and Brand, however, the plot is a triumph of inanity. As a remake of the Oscar-winning movie from 1981 starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minelli, the story—original on its first release—now appears trite and somewhat morally vacuous, largely because this update of the film tries to have it both ways. On the one hand, the plot’s basic moral is the value of love over money, demonstrated when Arthur finds the backbone to disregard his inheritance in lieu of Naomi. However, this message is subverted by the movie’s conclusion, in which Arthur drives down a New York city street in his novelty car with Naomi perched next to him—that is, with both the girl and the money. Not only is the film guilty of peddling a hackneyed life lesson, but its own ending undermines the mantra it claims to preach.
Setting aside the film’s moral miasma, though, it must be acknowledged that nearly every actor perfectly fulfills his or her comedic role in the movie despite the long shadow cast by the celebrated original film—Brand must fill the shoes of comedic icon Dudley Moore, whilst Greta Gerwig must compete with Liza Minnelli. “Arthur” also manages to sidestep some of this legacy by replacing the original Butler Hobson with the female Nanny Hobson. These performances ground the film and enable it to transcend its unremarkable storyline.
The role of Arthur is one that Russell Brand seamlessly inhabits. Indeed, as Brand’s film career progresses, it is perhaps fitting for him to take on the role that catapulted another British comedian—Dudley Moore—to Hollywood stardom. Brand’s Arthur, however, is more innocent, his character’s child-like attributes consistently amplified. Arthur’s youthful simplicity, as evinced by Brand, allows for him to perform scenes with authenticity that in less capable hands would descend into absurdity—including one in which Arthur is dressed in a gummy-bear costume with his mouth coated by the sticky remnants of the sweets he has just consumed.
The style of this light-hearted performance—synthesizing parody and pathos—is not limited to Brand. Helen Mirren’s quip to Arthur of “wash your winky” simultaneously reflects her ability to inhabit the role of mother-figure to a stunted adult while mocking the role’s absurdity. Jennifer Garner, as Brand’s bride-to-be, is also not so much an archetypal corporate executive as a caricature of one: abrasively ambitious, cut-throat, menacing, and with a surprisingly bizarre sexual appetite that leaves even Arthur the playboy running for cover.
The quality of these cleverly conceived characters means that when all is said and done, though “Arthur” is inherently hampered by its banal plot, the film still largely succeeds. Ultimately, the logic, ingenuity, and even coherence of the film’s narrative progression is beside the point. Rather, it is the absurdity of Brand’s actions, Mirren’s wry humor, and a sparkling set of supporting performances that enable “Arthur” to coalesce into a delightful comedy—even if it entirely lacks substantive moral value.

The ominously dramatic title of Meg Wolitzer’s latest novel, “The Uncoupling,” is evocative of a horror thriller. The plot, which centers around a mysterious curse that causes a town’s women to shun their husbands and boyfriends sexually, might sound like the makings of horror to some. However, the story relies on introspective examination of the love lives of women rather than mystery, intrigue, or excitement. Though Wolitzer’s prose is occasionally poignant and insightful, “The Uncoupling” is a stylistic muddle of a novel. Wolitzer’s attempts to sustain elements of satire and fantasy undermine her observations about her characters and ultimately destroy any hope of relating to them. Not only does her exploration of the female experience fall flat, but her sex-centric plot offends more than it entertains.
In “The Uncoupling,” a small town in New Jersey is rocked by the arrival of a new drama teacher at Eleanor Roosevelt High School. For her inaugural school play, she chooses “Lysistrata,” the Aristophanes comedy about women who withhold sex from their husbands to protest a war. The plot of the play coincides with the previously mentioned curse to be cast over the school’s women. As a result, the romantic relationships of both students and faculty unravel with the loss of physical intimacy. The novel, divided into three parts, alternates between several female perspectives, but focuses mainly on the viewpoint of two English teachers: Dory Lang and her perfect husband Robby, also an English teacher at Eleanor Roosevelt. Their wallflower daughter Willa struggles in her own relationship.
Though the Langs are painstakingly, cloyingly described as the golden couple of the high school’s faculty, Dory eventually manages to become a relatable protagonist. Her husband, Robby, unfortunately, remains as defined as a silhouette. He is presented as nothing more than an ideal spouse and father who misses intimacy with Dory. Most of the novel’s men suffer from similarly poor characterization. While the novel’s women are sophisticated, complicated creatures, their men are limited to two feelings: sexual satisfaction and sexual frustration. The result is a work of fiction that walks the fine line between being humorous and being politically problematic, too often straying onto the wrong side. Occasionally, Wolitzer’s jokes about the differences between men and women are successful, but too often they engender a response summarized by a man’s outcry at the school production: “We’re not all disgusting, sex-crazed warriors. And what’s wrong with what we do want? Urges are normal. What’s so bad about them? I resent this whole play.” For a novel that attempts to bring modern resonance to a classical comedy, its tone feels remarkably outdated.
The curse, which remains inexplicable for the vast majority of the novel, renders the story less intelligent and relatable. Instead of creating a sense of suspense or wonder, it vastly undermines the story. Wolitzer’s women have understandable, appropriate reasons for not having sex with their men; no frivolous plot device is needed to justify their actions. The high school’s production of “Lysistrata” is cause enough to plant the idea in the women’s heads to withhold sex from their partners. In fact, there are countless normal, non-mystical factors that might eliminate sexual desire that Wolitzer might have used instead of magic. The plot device has negative implications, insinuating that the women’s lack of desire is irrational and unnatural. In the novel’s distinctly unsatisfying ending, Wolitzer explains the origin of the curse. Its mystical cause feels silly and arbitrary, and the disclosure does not remotely mitigate the curse’s detracting effect.
Though far from redeeming “The Uncoupling,” Wolitzer’s prose can be remarkable. Dory, after reminiscing about older days, admits the thrill of new technology. She confesses that even people of her age are “excited when new, seductive electronic inventions appeared; they updated their own computers and bought their own gadgets, which they carried everywhere, enjoying the reassuring feel of an object in a pocket, and the texture of its skin-tight protective case that made it seem like it was in a condom, pulsing and fully loaded and waiting.” Her scintillating insights into the lives of ordinary people like Dory are deliciously sensual and remarkably incisive. This is where Wolitzer’s true strengths lie, not in the overwhelming plot threads and themes she attempts to juggle.
“The Uncoupling” has the ingredients for a sophisticated and entertaining read; unfortunately, Wolitzer uses too many of them. She attempts to do justice to several themes, and in doing so, she diminishes them to clichés. When student Marissa Clayborn holds a “bed-in”—which is as ridiculous as it sounds—to protest the war in Afghanistan, the natural response is a roll of the eyes, even though Clayborn’s intentions are honorable. Similarly, Dory guiltily confesses to the school psychologist, “I have the nicest husband in the world … and I’ve wrecked things. I’ve made him unhappy.” The resulting inclination is not to sympathize or identify with the struggling spouse but instead wish that she was less spineless. Wolitzer’s competing intentions—to carefully examine the lives of ordinary women, but also assert lofty opinions about war, sex, and technology—renders the novel unsophisticated and unfocused, removing layers of meaning instead of adding them.

April 14-16, 8:00 p.m.
Adams Pool Theatre
Directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14
Produced by Mary C. Hallowell ’14 and Margaret Jiang  ’14
Andrew J. Boyd ’14 and Jacob A. Brandt ’14 have imaginations that extend far beyond the small confines of the Adams Pool Theatre. As Boyd says, “one of the wonderful things about theater ... is the suspension of disbelief.” The suspension of disbelief plays an important role in an upcoming play that combines Sacramento, aliens, and punk rock.
“Zirn Sees the Specks of Light” is the only play this year written and directed by freshmen, besides the Freshman Musical. Boyd wrote the play, but would not reveal much about its plot. Instead, he talked about its inspiration. A Phoenix native, Boyd says, “I wanted to tell a story about Arizona ... especially since I was writing this play right after 1070 [a controversial state anti-illegal immigration law] was passed and I was thinking about multiculturalism.” He decided to take this idea of the alien in America and apply it, quite literally, to aliens who visit the United States and try to find their places in American culture.
The show incorporates socially conscious music into its thematic pursuits. Twin leads Eli E. Kahn ’13 (Zirn) and Will D. Kehler ’12 (Balthor) seem very excited about the prospect of bringing loud, brash punk rock into the Adams Pool Theater.
Punk rock is only one representation of the questions of membership and identity that pop up in the script. “Every scene has a quick, bantering pace to it, which is incredibly funny at the same time as it is an impressive vehicle for the underlying commentary on social norms and identity,” says producer Mary C. Hallowell ’14.
“I think our show is going to be one of the more exciting shows that people will be able to see on campus,” Boyd says. From the few plot and tech details that were revealed, “Zirn” promises to be—at the very least—an original exploration of one of today’s most pressing public debates.

April 14-16, 8:00 p.m. and April 16-17, 2:00 p.m.
New College Theatre
Directed by Joshua R. McTaggart ’13 and Sam R. Schoenberg ’13
Produced by Ali R. Leskowitz ’11 and Caleb J. Thompson ’14
In the hammy form of a musical and under the cheery title “Parade” lies the dark true story of Leo Frank (Elliott J. Rosenbaum ’12), a Jewish man convicted in a show trial of raping and murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan (MaryGabrielle Prezioso ’13) in 1913 Georgia. Historical evidence has since indicated that Frank was innocent, and the details of his trial were suspicious enough in their own time that Georgia Governor John Slaton meddled in local affairs to have Frank’s sentence commuted from a death sentence to life in prison. The ensuing uproar led to the reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan and the formation of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish rights group.
In his Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club production, director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, also a Crimson arts comper, wants to create a realist portrayal of book writer Alfred Uhry’s and composer Jason Robert Brown’s piece. “Instead of making each character a caricature,” he says, “I want to make them the people they really were.” In order to diminish the production’s artifice, McTaggart and his technical director Christopher M. Wankel ’13 have chosen a spare aesthetic, and decided to emphasize the importance of Phagan as a character in her own right.
The most challenging task in accentuating the historical realism of “Parade” is dealing with the theatricality inherent to all musicals. “This is really not your typical musical,” says music director Sam R. Schoenberg ’13. “We want to take the audience on a real emotional ride as opposed to this jazz-hands musical you often get.” Of course, there will also be a few big musical numbers. “We’ve given the story gravity but also paid attention to theatrical detail,” says Amelia H. Ross ’14, who plays Frank’s wife Lucille. Combining drama and reality, the cast and crew of “Parade” aim for an honest rendering of Frank’s controversial life story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stark silhouettes of men dressed in fishnets and leather and women bare-breasted and clad in silvery silk adorn the pages of the Bible. As five immaculately manicured nails turn each page, Japanese dramatists, Milanesque models, and S&M soldiers constitute a cast of characters so dark it is baffling to think they’ll have to sing and dance to the whimsical lyrics of “Cabaret.” For this isn’t the Bible of Christian tradition, but The Costume Bible for the production of the Weimar musical.
The excellently manicured hand belongs to Jeannette Hawley, Costume Shop Manager of the American Repertory Theater, who held a small costuming seminar last Tuesday to show how those eerie designs go from a mere wisp of an idea to a three-dimensional work of art. Starting with a description of costume history, she conveyed the importance of dress and style to a realm outside the theater.
“Clothing relays status, even with t-shirts and jeans of college students. It is a symbol of socioeconomic status, politics, and class. Costuming is not merely the study of a pretty dress,” Hawley said.
Hawley has been the manager of American Repertory Theater’s Costume Shop for 10 years after a long career in the field. Starting from an early age, she took interest in clothing and its production. “My father was a taxidermist, my mother an excellent stitcher. I had a costume trunk and began sewing when I was four. By the time I reached high school, I was sewing for productions and my family,” Hawley said.
Cara Pacifico, a graduate of Tufts University who has worked as a technician for OBERON’s “Donkey Show,” was one of the attendees. She asked Hawley about what costumes can convey to the audience. “Whenever I make costumes for a woman, it’s easy to just look at it and compare it to myself. But what about for men? How do you define who has power, who has status? Who is older or younger?” Pacifico said.
Hawley launched into a deeply informative explanation of how costuming can say more than actors themselves. “It’s a European cut? Closely fitted to the body? That means he’s young. Is it square like a Willy Loman [a character in “Death of a Salesman”] business suit? That means he’s older, more with the status quo. Is there bright blue? That means you’re in the ’50s where everyone is rigidly formal and looks the same. Is the suit double-breasted? That means he has more power. Is it pinstriped? That means he’s a gangster,” Hawley said, listing off each question on a finger.
Hawley then proceeded to demonstrate how to make a simple design by draping, the process of fitting clothing to a wardrobe mannequin. Swiftly stitching the two pieces of muslin with an industrial sewing machine and ironing the fabric to create a pressed seam, Hawley fitted the mannequin within five minutes, producing a perfectly clean seamed line.
“One of the most beautiful things about being human is this ability to be symbolic. Printmaking, images, costuming, art, writing, it’s all creating something … and the story of costuming especially is one that is woven throughout history,” Hawley said.
In regards to how costuming is important in theater, Hawley has a simple philosophy. “Of course, the way costuming can succeed best is if the audience doesn’t notice it. If the actors are comfortable in the cloth and the fabric as well as comfortable with their characters’ potential of wearing it, that’s when you know you’ve done well,” Hawley said.
Katie Mastrogiacomo, who attended Smith College and works as an installation artist, agreed that total assimilation is an admirable goal, even in other domains. “Certain clothing in my installations can really affect the mood of the whole environment,” Mastrogiacomo said.
However, Hawley firmly believes in the practical clasps and buttons of costuming as well as artistic idealism, using an example akin to Harvard students’ question of the balance between sleep, friends, and class. “Do you want your costume fast, cheap, and pretty? Pick two,” Hawley said.

Waiting for Godot
April 14, 8:30 p.m., April 15, 7:30 p.m., April 16, 2:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Jan Luksic ’11
Produced by Andrew N. Shindi ’13, Jennifer A. Ingersoll ’11, and Milorad Dragicevic ’13
The tree is upside-down, the mound a heap of astronaut clothing, and the characters of Samuel Beckett’s existential leviathan “Waiting for Godot” will be caged by the audience and giant landscape mirrors. Even though this iconic work has been performed for almost 60 years, next week it will show for its first time ever at Harvard—but as the staging would suggest, director Jan Luksic ’11 has no intention of taking a traditional approach.
“Godot” follows Vladimir (Christopher J. Carothers ‘11) and Estragon (Peter K. Bestoso ‘14) as they literally wait for a person named Godot. In the meantime, they converse about life, memories, and even suicide. Luksic believes that “Godot” can be confounding to its audience, though maintains that it is universal at a base level. “Everything is a metaphor and it’s very applicable to the second half of the 20th century. It’s applicable to everybody. The characters are gladiators fighting for their lives, fighting for their lives through Beckett,” Luksic says.
Due to the Beckett estate’s zero-tolerance policy on changing “Godot,” the notion of gladiators fighting through the work is not far from the experience of the cast. “The main challenge is working within the constraints. Every step of how you walk, look, and think is prescribed,” Bestoso says. “If you come looking for a traditional play, you’ll be disappointed, then pleasantly surprised.” Since the dialogue must remain exactly as Beckett intended, Luksic and his technical staff have chosen to innovate through staging.
Stage manager David L. Orama ’12 notes that the rigid nature of “Godot” can reward sustained immersion. “When we had the read-through originally, some lines didn’t stand out, but each new time I engage with the text, I get something deep from it,” Orama says.
This level of intellectual participation not only extends to the actors and technicians, but also to the audience. Carothers says, “you can interpret Godot anyway you want to, but you have to be willing to engage with it. The text has no content. It’s all emotion, and so it essentially sets you free.”

I remember books. Not just texts, but books—the look of ink on paper, the feel of pages, the art on covers, the cracks in spines. I remember the first Norton Critical Edition I read—“The Sound and the Fury”—with its acid-free paper, typeset in Electra, and a picture of Faulkner’s home on the front. I remember reading “Jane Eyre” for the first time in a beat-up used paperback pocket edition. Its wood-pulp pages were so old and yellowed that they kept falling out the further I read. By the time Jane married Mr. Rochester, I was left with a stack of leaves between two covers. I remember my childhood Bible, my Dr. Seuss omnibus, the small hardcover novelization of Peter Pan my mom brought me back from England. I remember the scriptural heft of the deckle-edged, double-volume Robert Fagles translation of the Homeric epics; the seriousness and calmness of the bleached, wide-margined paper of Isaiah Berlin’s “Four Essays on Liberty;” the spacing of the lines, set in sweet Adobe Garamond, of the “Harry Potter” books. I remember things that weren’t technically books at all: the copy paper on which I printed out and read “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” for the very first time, the Sony Reader screen on which I just finished “Sense and Sensibility.”
Among people who read lots of literature—be it verse or prose, fiction or fact—there are two loose but very real camps. The first consists of people for whom the book provides a vehicle for the text. The physical characteristics of this vehicle do not matter. It may be hardcover or paperback, typeset in any font, printed on grey paper or cream, used or new—they could care less, as long as they have the text, legible and reliable. These are the dualists, believing in the separability of the book and the text, the body and the mind.
The second camp, as you might suspect, are the monists, who insist that the book and the text are inextricably bound together. These are the readers who, before they buy a book, check the acidity of its paper; readers who scour the notes on typeface at the back of a novel, who have favorite dust jackets and layouts and spines. They are so picky because, for them, the physical reading experience affects the meaning of the text itself. Typefaces impart gravity or ease; margins impart degrees of focus. Cover images affect the attitude you bring to a text. Even the color and feeling of the endpapers flavor the experience.
The dualists generally think the monists are capricious and unfocused—batters who can’t hit the ball because they’re preoccupied with the feel of the bat. The monists think the dualists are insensitive louts who are blind to an entire world rich with sensations and emotions. The dualists are ascetics, disciplined, attentive to the word in its spiritual purity; the monists are aesthetes, sensualists, consumed with the mystery of the incarnation and the many sacraments built up around it. Dualists shake your hand; monists hug you.
I am a monist through and through. For me, the form of a book has always impacted the meaning of the text, from children’s books on up. Books cue certain interactions and shun others. Some books wear suits and some wear jeans; some have oily hands, and some smell oddly of cigarettes, cats, and spring rain. These are superficialities, but integral superficialities, in the same way that one’s hair or height is integral. One mind in a different body would no longer be the same person, taken as a whole. The same text in two different books is not the same experience.
Reading, consequently, is a deeply corporeal experience, as much as eating or seeing or having a cold. It doesn’t take place merely in the arena of the mind, with ideas and images tossed around in some purely abstract realm, but instead plays itself out between flesh and paper. It binds ideas with the vessels that hold them, with the circumstances of their use; it engages the full range of human faculties, at least as much so as parachuting or cooking or playing music. Reading is not in the least a detached exercise that separates the mental and the physical. It welds the touch and sight and smell of a moment to the vivid, hovering clouds of the imagination—fuses the body to the mind and soul.
I remember reading “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” in the sanctuary of a church on a sunny Thursday afternoon when I was 15. I was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops; it was a wood-pulp paper Penguin Classics edition; the temperature was 76 degrees, and the light through the stained glass windows felt like the cool of a river on a windless day.

The year is 1575. Mexico City has been struck by a plague. But behind the walls of a specialized school, painters, artists, and wise men of the Aztec tradition are working to complete a project that takes their minds away from the horror of death around them. Sometimes at night these scribes turn to drink to assuage their sorrows, but by day they meticulously compile the 12 books that comprise “La Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España,” more commonly known as the Florentine Codex.
Fray Bernardino de Sahagún directed the project from 1545 until his death in 1590. The work, which consists of Spanish text, Aztec Nahuatl text (in Roman script), and pictorial representations, has been an invaluable resource for historians of Mesoamerica. When it was completed, it was smuggled into Spain, where parts of it were denounced as professing idolatry. It eventually made its way to the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence. How exactly the Medici family acquired the codex remains a mystery.
On April 6 the director of the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City, Diana Magaloni Kerpel, came to the Sackler Museum to discuss many of the mysteries surrounding the codex. In her talk “Followers of Apelles: The Nahua Artists of the Florentine Codex,” she delivered a passionate presentation that shared both her own contagious excitement for the document and the scope of the work she and others have carried out in examining the circumstances surrounding its creation and preservation. The Museo Nacional is a bit of a legend among those of us with a passion for Mesoamerica; it displays many of the grandest works of Pre-Columbian art from Mexico. The art it houses and the museum itself have been sources of inspiration for many, including the Mexican writer Octavio Paz and Chicana writer Gloria Anzaldúa.
In 2006 Magaloni Kerpel and a team of experts began research on the Florentine Codex, first analyzing the pigments used in the document. As an art historian, the director analyzed the stylistic trends she noticed in the pictorials and identified different individual artists. After organizing the data, she posited that four master artists had been in charge of the production, and her theory was corroborated by the fact that Sahagún mentions exactly four men by name in the one paragraph in which he discusses the making of the document.
In her presentation, the director emphasized that the document itself is a kind of hybrid incorporating both traditional Aztec and colonial Spanish elements. It is called a “Codex,”  a word which typically denotes a Pre-Columbian screenfold document painted on panels of indigenous amatl paper that fold out accordion-style; but it is, in fact, a book, bound in the European way and made with expensive and time-resistant paper imported mainly from Italy and France. Moreover, the director pointed out instances of highly developed musculature in the depiction of the human body that display clear Renaissance influences, as well as hatch-marks that indicate influences from the European etchings of the time. But she also pointed out the traditional symbolism of the colors used in the pictorials: “Maya blue” and “Maya green” both indicate divinity and mimic the color of precious greenstones or quetzal feathers.

But she also pointed out the traditional symbolism of the colors used in the pictorials: “Maya blue” and “Maya green” both indicate divinity and mimic the color of precious greenstones or quetzal feathers. The Codex is, therefore, neither definitively indigenous nor colonial; the contributions of both cultures are integral and entertwined.
As for the question of what exactly these men did behind the walls of Sahagún’s school, Magaloni Kerpel says they spent time gathering the raw materials needed to tease out the vibrant pigments still so visible in the manuscript today. They recorded their recipes in the book, mostly in pictorial form. Perhaps the most impressive of these pigments was a brilliant red gleaned from a plant that only released its color after being soaked in water for seven years.
Many artists were involved in the production of the Florentine Codex over a span of 45 years, so it is not surprising that many different voices can be heard, so to speak, in the final document—voices raised by artists who harmonized in ways that disturbed the old order and embraced the new. The Florentine Codex is a manifestation of what Latin America is today: a blend of indigenous, European, African, and global voices that creates new forms of expression. Due to this hybridity, which has flowed across borders into the now Latinized United States, we can eat burritos in the middle of Cambridge, or we can stop for a moment in the middle of Harvard Square and listen to the clear, airy voices of indigenous flutes played by Spanish speakers.

At age 10 I was, as far as pop culture went, a hopelessly backward little girl. My total exposure to The Spice Girls was an awkward birthday party during which my host demanded to know, “do you think you’re more like Baby Spice or Ginger Spice?” When a friend told me how awesome N*Sync was, I matter-of-factly trotted over to the kitchen sink, genuinely curious as to what awesome thing had been stashed in there. About the only artist I was familiar with was Eminem, thanks to my older brother, but after receiving a tongue-lashing for muttering the words to “The Real Slim Shady” at recess, I deduced that Mr. Mathers fell squarely in the ‘not appropriate’ category.
My mother, in a subtle attempt to make me cool, gave me a CD player and a Britney Spears CD for Christmas that year. After she patiently answered my questions about who the heck Britney Spears was and why the CD was so pink, I gave “Baby One More Time” a listen or two. And I tried to like it, honest. But a week later, Nintendo Power magazine decided to send me a little “thanks for subscribing!” gift, and I became the proud owner of the “Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time” soundtrack. Ms. Spears no longer stood a chance.
I loved that Zelda CD, listening to it over and over, and I tried, with absolutely no success, to get my friends to listen to it too. The conversation ran something like this:
Friend: How do you even ... are you supposed to dance to this?
Me: Well, you don’t.
Friend: Where are the lyrics?
Me: Well, there aren’t any.
Friend: And ... you like this?
Me (with cheerful obliviousness): Of course!
For years, video game tunes were all I listened to—and when I figured out how to convert MIDI files into sheet music, they were all I really wanted to play on the piano. Nowadays, I’ve diversified my tastes quite a bit, and I listen to just about everything: hip-hop, ska, pop-punk, classical, whatever. But I still find myself drifting back to my myriad video game music playlists from time to time. The opening theme to “Chrono Cross” still sends a chill down my spine every time I hear it. Despite the fact that I haven’t seriously practiced piano in years, I can still play “To Zanarkand” from “Final Fantasy X” by heart.
I’d be perfectly willing to chalk up my love for this strange little niche of music to just my being weird, if I were the only one—but it turns out there are tons of people who love game music. Check out a site like ocremix.org and you’ll find a community of dozens of amateur musicians and music majors who spend their time creating remixes and covers of their favorite game tunes. (Incidentally, this explains why I have six versions of “Terra’s Theme” from “Final Fantasy 6” in my iTunes library: techno, dance, acoustic guitar, orchestral, and—not making this up!—French rap.)
And it’s not just the fans. Some game composers have an obsession bordering on insanity with crafting the perfect soundtrack. Yasunori Mitsuda composed the music for “Chrono Trigger,” a 1995 Super Nintendo game. Back then, everything was still 2D, graphics were still fairly simple, and the potential music range was still limited by the game system’s clunky, primitive technology—but Mitsuda absolutely slaved over the soundtrack, working night after night until he passed out. In the end, he managed to stress himself out so much that he developed ulcers, became hospitalized, and had to have someone else finish the last few songs for him. All that for a set of bleeps and bloops—but some of the prettiest bleeps and bloops I’ve ever heard.
I can’t tell you what exactly it is that makes game music special: it’s often deliberately designed to be played over and over, repetitively; it’s meant to be background noise; and, until very recently, it was limited to a narrow spectrum of synthesized sounds. Composers were forced to play two roles, both composer and sound engineer. And yet, a kid in my Expository Writing 20 class last year wrote his final paper about game music. I know a girl at the Berklee School of Music who attributes her choice to play piano to her love for the “Final Fantasy” soundtrack.  Orchestras like the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Atlanta Symphony have performed multiple game music concerts. I might have been weird as a kid for neglecting Britney Spears for the sounds of Zelda. But more and more, it seems like I probably wasn’t the only one.

When pressed to characterize his latest album “Tomboy,” Noah Lennox—aka Panda Bear—told interviewer Joe Colly of Pitchfork, “I really hesitate to say it has any sort of religious or sacred feeling—but it’s in that direction to me.” Though he might not openly endorse the association, Panda Bear and early religious music share a few subtle but striking connections. His trademark vocals—tightly layered harmonies moving in homophony—are notably chant-like in texture, and his 2007 release “Person Pitch” included an entire track built on a sample of a rondeau by French composer Guillaume de Machaut. More than anything else, though, Panda Bear and sacred music share a tendency toward simple, eloquent melodies.
Given his reputation for musical experimentation—particularly alongside his bandmates in Animal Collective—it’s all too easy to overlook the fact that Lennox is an exceptionally adept melodist. The joy of “Tomboy” is in its focus on his clean, expressive tunefulness. In that regard, Panda Bear’s latest marks a movement toward a more streamlined method of composition that emphasizes the strength of his songwriting over sonic innovation.
Unfortunately, this stylistic shift is potentially alienating, as “Tomboy” has a daunting legacy up to which it must live: Lennox’s breakthrough record, “Person Pitch.” The 2007 album was an imaginative triumph in which Lennox blended countless samples into sprawling, 12-minute epics that drew from world music, ’60s guitar pop, and musique concrète in equal measure. In the wake of such a ground-breaking and diverse album, Panda Bear’s newfound minimalism could be misconstrued as a self-conscious retreat.
To be fair, “Tomboy” is not “Person Pitch”—as detractors will undoubtedly note, it is less conceptually progressive than its predecessor and it lacks the immediate ear-catching appeal of tracks like “Bros.” Yet while the genre-bending ambition of “Person Pitch” may be gone, Lennox’s new emphasis on melody allows him to achieve an emotional clarity far beyond that of his previous work. This record marks a step away from “Person Pitch,” not a step back. In prioritizing musicality over sonic exploits, Lennox lets the deeply personal nature of his music take hold in a way it hasn’t before.
This more reserved approach is immediately apparent—the opening track “You Can Count on Me” evokes serenity and steadfastness while establishing the record’s parameters. From its first moments, the vocals ring out in unaccompanied harmony; the phrase “know you can count on me” is set to an easy, mellifluous motif. This theme is thrown into relief by a reduced instrumental palette—as with most of “Tomboy,” the song is comprised solely of vocals, guitar, and a mid-tempo beat. Furthermore, the lyrical repetition renders the song almost trance-like in effect. Though elementary in construction, the track achieves an unexpected transcendence.
Despite the simplicity of its arrangements, “Tomboy” never feels static or monotonous; it is a credit to Lennox’s penchant for musical invention that almost every track manages to create a distinctive atmosphere. “Surfers Hymn” lets bright harmonies ride over buoyant, jangling percussion, while “Drone” warps a sustained vocal line to match the electronic timbre of the tones that underscore it. On “Slow Motion,” a canon of echo-laden voices blossoms over the album’s most infectious beat. The pulsing piano dirge and chromatic queasiness of “Scheherezade” hearken back to the gauzy elegies of his 2004 record “Young Prayer.”
What ties this album together, however, is the feeling of sincerity that underlies each track. “Last Night at the Jetty” is exemplary of this sentimental lucidity—initially the song seems unremarkable, but it has the rare quality growing more affecting with each listen. The chorus builds to a dulcet, descending vocal line steeped in nostalgia—“I know we / I know we / Had a good time.” Halfway through, this remorse melts into a touching moment of self-actualization as Lennox sings, “I don’t want to describe something that I’m not.” The lyrics are intentionally elliptical, merely insinuating the self-doubt and vulnerability that make this track so poignant.
It’s easy to guess the origin of such insecurities. “Person Pitch” was such a remarkable album that, upon first listen, “Tomboy” may seem underwhelming by comparison. While it may lack the pioneering spirit of its predecessor, the meticulously crafted melodies and sentiment on this record make it perhaps the most rewarding Panda Bear release to date. As Lennox hinted, the record holds an emotional and personal gravitas not unlike that of early sacred music, and the devoted listener might just discover hints of the sublime

Now that grooves and large wooden speaker cabinets have been supplanted by strings of binary code and tiny white earbuds, it can be easy to lose the personal connections that make the best albums such powerful works. The creators of Record Store Day are trying to show that records as physical objects and the stores that sell them are far from gone, despite the rising prevalence of digital music. Conceived by record store-chain marketing vice-president Chris Brown—no, not that one—this ‘holiday’ is now in its fourth year and promises to bring exclusive records and artist appearances to independent record stores across the world. Although music lovers usually look towards Tuesdays for new album releases, Saturday, April 16 promises to lighten the wallets of aficionados.
Despite the day’s honorable intention, many local Cambridge record stores abstain from festivities because they feel the holiday is too corporate—the 2011 Record Store Day Ambassador is none other than Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath and bat-eating fame. As Ozzy Osbourne’s musical output of late has been less than stellar, his contribution to the event is merely his big label success, and his selection as Record Store Day Ambassador betrays the profit-seeking mentality that partially motivates the event. However, putting aside big-label biases, it’s hard to discredit some of the day’s better products. The day provides some exciting new releases, but is also proving to be a venue for older bands to put out rare or previously unreleased material. Nirvana is reissuing “Hoarmoaning,” their limited-run 1992 EP, and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers are re-releasing their eponymous debut in addition to their second album, “You’re Gonna Get It!”
Substance aside, Record Store Day has often been characterized by gimmicky releases, and this year’s event is no different. For listeners who are more inclined to this sort of product, the event’s creators have put out a “Side by Side” series designed to combine originals by classic bands with covers by contemporary mainstream artists. This makes for some odd pairings: “Don’t Want to Know If You Are Lonely” features ’80s hardcore band Hüsker Dü and pop-punk rock trio Green Day. If that’s not weird enough, another from the series—“Havana Affair”—is split between punk stars The Ramones and California rockers The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Unexpected combinations seem to be one of Record Store Day’s trademark gimmicks; although not in the “Side by Side” series, Of Montreal and Norwegian pop act Casiokids are releasing a record in which the former covers Buffalo Springfield’s “Expecting to Fly,” while the latter performs a new track called “London Zoo.” Though not a joint effort, the limited edition Flaming Lips’ “Heady Nuggs” box set combines five LPs into one gloriously overpriced yet undoubtedly enticing package.
Because Record Store Day is intended as a full-fledged musical event and not merely a day for new releases, performances and record signings abound. Newbury Comics’ Newbury Street location is the best place to check for events closest to Harvard—TV on the Radio is set to autograph their new album “Nine Types of Light,” and there will be performances by the synth-pop act Dom and country-rock group Buffalo Tom.
Record Store Day might be a gimmicky way to hype the dying music industry, but music snobs should still remember its core principles. As Jack White says on the official website, “Show respect for the tangible music that you’ve dedicated your careers and lives to, and help it from becoming nothing more than disposable digital data.” Although it’s easy to be seduced by the ease of buying all your music from home, the goal of Record Store Day—to preserve the time-honored ritual of going to the record store, buying an album, and keeping it for as long as it lasts—at least provides a necessary chance for reflection on the state of modern music.

Only on a Low album would a minute-long, near-silent introduction of dolorous piano notes and guitar drones seem like the ultimate distillation of the band’s style. This has always been their sound, and “C’mon” is no different. The songs are not laden with superfluous frills or overly dramatic lyrics: instead, simple melodies confidently stand on their own and make the album play like a laid-back, ten-movement symphony—a cohesive work in which all the songs fit firmly into a well-defined aesthetic structure. Save for a few missteps, this method produces yet another well-composed slowcore album complete with minimalist compositions and subdued melodies.
Low’s heavy reliance on instrumentals and evocatively vague lyrical snippets on this album allows their artistry to flourish. Their creative freedom is best evidenced by the beautifully spare “Done”: though the song’s crescendo is not what would normally be expected of a climax in rock music, Low’s skillful command of dynamics enables the band to bring the track to an emotional peak with the mere addition of a pedal steel guitar and a more noticeable harmony.
Their stylized sparseness is also reflected in their lyrics. Poignant and pensive, “Majesty/Magic” is a perfect example of the importance of their lyrical brevity; the refrain “Oh Majesty” is one of the few lines in the song, yet it conveys a certain passion and bears an emotional weight that few artists can express with so few words. “$20,” by stark contrast, displays how this method fails to produce listenable music—the bland, lyrical loop of “my love is for free” drags on ceaselessly. Equally feeble guitar chords do nothing to compensate for the lack of inspiring lyrics. On the album’s best tracks, lead singer Alan Sparhawk’s baritone is intriguingly weary, but on “$20” it sounds flat, melodramatic, and self-pitying.
Only in “Especially Me” does the band stray away from the well-established mold to successfully add a little versatility to the mix. It includes a compelling metaphor preceded by a repeated guitar arpeggio: “Cry me a river / So I can float over to you / The bearer to deliver the news.” The impeccable pairing of these two equally strong elements makes this one of the superior tracks on the album. “Nightingale,” another standout, opens with serene, reverberating guitar chords and continues in a similarly beautifully evocative vein. The airy, optimistic vibe provides a welcome complement to the characteristic weight of the other tracks. Low’s vocal harmonies soar in the chorus—“Oh nightingale / Don’t you cry”—and the simple layering also works quite nicely in “You See Everything,” a stirring duet.
Unsurprisingly, Low fails when they leave their slowcore comfort zone. A spastic, blatantly atypical electric guitar introduction wrenches the album out of its lush serenity in “Nothing But Heart,” and not even a smooth return to a mid-tempo section salvages this track. The dirge-like “Witches” provides the same drama that “Nothing but Heart” aims for, but it aligns much more smoothly with the band’s quintessential style. However, the ominous lyrics—“When you have finally submitted to embarrassing capture / Take out that baseball bat and show those witches some pasture”—are slightly nullified by the misplaced twang of a banjo. Though those two components clash, a more fitting somber guitar solo towards the end of the piece brings it back up to par. Album closer “Something’s Turning Over” does much better to incorporate bluegrass-tinged, folk-like qualities. Despite its rather bizarre lyrics—“Angels setting fire to the ocean / Pirates making liars out of men / I don’t think we’ll ever see their faces / I don’t think we’ll ever see the end”—the track still allows the record to end on a high note.
Low has spent almost two decades as a band, yet they still produce original and compelling music, at their best when they remain in their niche. It’s a shame that some of the songs on this album will probably never see nationwide airplay, but perhaps, like their music, quietness suits them best.

Mat Johnson’s latest novel “Pym” is a formal tribute to Edgar Allan Poe’s only long-form work “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket”—but it is a functional critique. An adventure novel through and through, “Pym” follows in the tradition of American seafaring narratives set up by Poe, whose “Narrative” influenced Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick.” It is perhaps natural that Americans—themselves the offspring of the continent that was for so long the ‘last frontier’—would be drawn to the vast, mysterious seas to quench their desire for adventure in as-yet unexplored domains. Hidden at the heart of many oceanic enterprises, however, has been a darker, more understated motive of exploitation. Slave trading, uprooting of indigenous populations, environmental profiteering—all of these have been a part of the practice of sea exploration for centuries. “Pym”—unhindered by the burden of characterization or detailed and nuanced prose by its claim as an adventure novel—satirizes these tendencies and shows that they are still very real, while also fueling a fast-paced, plot-driven narrative.
“Pym” follows Chris Jaynes, a recently fired professor of African American literature obsessed with “The Narrative.” He believes that it holds the secret to American race relations and humanity’s obsession with “whiteness.” He gets hold of evidence that suggests Poe’s novel was actually based on real-life events and, with nothing to lose, decides to join a crew heading to the Antarctic on a fresh-water bottling venture. His aim is to search for Poe’s “Tsalal”—a tropical island near the South Pole inhabited by black natives who have never come into contact with the white population or had to endure the subsequent complications. Its discovery would not only affirm for Chris his racial identity and academic career, but also save his romantic life: his ex-wife—whom he hopes to win back—is one of the lawyers accompanying the all-black crew. 
One constant throughout the ever-changing backdrops of “Pym” is its sense of humor. This is partly due to the colorful cast that accompanies Chris—as well as the pronounced characteristics of Chris himself. As a black academic, his first-person musings always toe the line between a street-ready “brother” and a self-conscious and neurotic scholar. One side of him constantly satirizes the other, since the two often seem in opposition, and the result is an idiosyncratic and often hilarious narrator. The eccentricities of the others—a gay couple who run an adventure blog by night and work as water engineers by day, a money-obsessed entertainment lawyer, his newly-wed wife who is a self-proclaimed soror of Delta Sigma Theta, a jaded and paranoid sea captain, and an overweight Detroit bus driver—make the dialogue amusing, if not slightly ludicrous. When the crew first comes into contact with the mysterious creatures in the belly of the Antarctic, one of them holds his hand out to Chris. Shocked, he can’t move. His crew responds: “‘You going to leave him hanging?’ Jeffree asked, incredulous, to which the others agreed in a united chorus of ‘Don’t leave him hanging.’”
Indeed, the quirks of the characters are often overstated, as are the many issues that “Pym” confronts. For the most part, this is a successful technique. When exaggerated and framed in a foreign setting like the South Pole, capitalistic greed, racism, and the underlying human instincts that drive these vices are revealed as the absurdities that they are. Nathaniel the entertainment lawyer says, “we are going to be very famous. We are going to be very famous, and very, very rich,” in the face of the mysterious and beautiful discoveries they are making in the Antarctic. It’s a disapproving nod to the history of exploration and an exasperated laugh at the humanity that never learns.
In its many caricatured themes and characters, however, detail is lost. Much of “Pym” passes by hastily, in murky chunks of viciously swift and careless prose. The love story between Chris and his ex-wife is poorly developed, and when it is, it is juvenile—and even worse, full-on cheesy. “She didn’t even flinch at the L-word. She just got a little tear in her eye, which she wiped on her glove, where it froze. It had been almost a decade since I had told her that I loved her, and last time she didn’t cry at all. I did. ‘And I will get you out of here. I promise,’ I told her. And we both believed me.” This subplot isn’t the only element that suffers. No insight is given to the inner world of the many potentially engaging characters—not even that of Chris. Despite the many traumas, the ensuing emotions are merely suggested. The framing device may be to blame: the preface, penned by Chris, confesses to “an insecurity in [his] abilities as a writer.” Though the stylistic failures are in line with Chris’s acknowledgement, it seems unlikely that a professor of literature would pay so little heed to narrative nuance.
One can hardly begrudge “Pym” these disappointments, though. As an adventure novel it is wildly successful: the plot almost moves itself along, and its lack of detail may be a necessary cost. It speaks volumes of Johnson’s skill that “Pym” remains engaging despite its flaws. Perhaps Johnson was expressing his own hopes for his work when Chris says of Poe’s protagonist: “Pym that is maddening, Pym that is brilliance, Pym whose failures entice instead of repel.”

The music video for “Will Do,” TV on the Radio’s latest single, portrays members of the band approaching middle age and struggling with their waning youth and loss of intimacy in a futuristic world. For a band like TV on the Radio, whose founding members Tunde Adebimpe and David Andrew Sitek are respectively 36 and 38 years old, it’s tempting to imagine these themes are close to home. Despite its somewhat kitschy and wholly trippy aesthetic, the video manages to be both powerful and painful, evocative and entertaining, and it perfectly encapsulates the ethos of the album.
“Nine Types of Light” conveys an overwhelming sense of maturity in its every aspect. While TV on the Radio favors a more diverse and experimental approach over the adoption of a unified sound, their experiments never sound forced, and the songs effortlessly evoke the themes they describe. Earlier albums like “Desperate Youth, Bloodthirsty Babes” saw the band sacrificing thematic consistency for their occasionally off-putting forays into the unconventional—for instance, the ominous a cappella introduction of “Ambulance.” What separates “Nine Types of Light” from earlier albums, then, is its overarching coherence, despite all its boundary-pushing.
The first line of the first track, “Second Song,” establishes a candid self-reflectivity: “Confidence and ignorance approve me / Define my day-to-day / I’ve tried so hard to shut it down / Lock it up, gently walk away.” The abrupt confession of this vocal introduction combined with Adebimpe’s confident, jaunty delivery instantly sets a tone of intimate candor that continues through the rest of “Nine Types of Light.”
Permeating the entire album is an underlying desire for intimacy and companionship. Songs like “Will Do” and “You” deal explicitly with these fundamental themes. On “Will Do,” Adebimpe addresses a past love: “It might be impractical to seek out a new romance / We won’t know the actual if we never take the chance / I’d like to collapse with you and ease you against this song.” Adebimpe characterizes his music as a tool of intimacy, and the progression of the album as a whole most effectively displays this belief. “Nine Types of Light” works as a catalogue of intensely personal views on a wide variety of subjects: “Repetition” reveals its petty and self-aware frustration with the human condition while the reverent “Killer Crane” portrays a connection between spirituality and the natural world. Through its broad-reaching themes and confessional nature, the album slowly unveils its multifaceted personality.
However, the dense production seems at first to deny the intimacy that the lyrics invite. While the songs provide glimpses of the infectious licks and lines that make TV on the Radio so appealing, their trademark grit is hard to detect beneath the album’s futuristic sheen. Imperfections in production, like personality quirks, often reveal the motivation behind the album’s creation, and the extra depth that the candor of the lyrics promise is, at first, hard to find in the music. The production seems to deny the very access that the lyrics invite, but this contradiction is paradoxically the album’s most engaging quality. By the time the fifth track, “Killer Crane” comes around, its hymnal and elegiac sound somehow recasts earlier tracks that at first seemed too purposefully erudite as endearingly guarded. “Crane” marks the point at which the album becomes most open, and the rest of the album boldly continues in this self-revelatory vein.
On “Nine Types of Light” TV on the Radio manage to strike an almost perfect balance between art rock experimentation and intense, emotional accessibility. While it has fewer angsty grooves than normally appear on their albums, the band succeeds in presenting a completely human experience that sounds new and different, but winds up feeling intimately knowable and engagingly personal.

In a recent faculty meeting, Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds announced that steps were being taken to reform January Term, partly in response to survey results that indicated low student participation and mixed student satisfaction. Hammonds stated that Optional Winter Activities Week would officially be extended from eight to ten days “in order to avoid reopening the Houses on a weekend day” and that additional consideration was being given to allowing students with internships and independent projects to remain on campus and opening more House dining halls during the break. In addition, one of the priorities of this review would include renaming the program, possibly Optional January Term.
While the College’s decision to re-examine and reform January Term is a step in the right direction, there is greater room for improvement than these half-hearted proposals would suggest. At present, it seems like the administration is torn between a desire to improve programming during OWAW and a reluctance to grant the funding that would be necessary for these improvements. To make the best use of resources, the administration should decide whether to take OWAW in the same direction as MIT’s program-intensive Independent Activities Period—or to leave the time open for students to focus on their own independent, self-initiated endeavors, and make funding resources available for these. Either way, more decisive action needs to be taken in the next few months to provide students and faculty with adequate time to plan their schedules for January 2012.
The underlying issue with this year’s OWAW was its failure to draw students back to campus. Of the students who completed the winter break survey, 37 percent said they had returned to campus for OWAW. Survey results indicated that approximately 70 percent of polled students would participate in credited courses had they been available for the time period. While Associate Dean and Senior Adviser to the Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin II, stated that he would like to determine future funding and programming based on student participation—in his words, students “voting with their feet”—it is impossible to truly gauge the breadth of student interest unless a wider variety of programs become available during the time. This much is clear; survey results and the success of this year’s programs indicate a surplus of student interest and a deficit of student opportunity.
The reality is that simple changes, like opening more dining halls and extending the program by two days, are not an alternative to the more difficult, costly change of increasing substantive programming. The underlying issues with the current January program, e.g. loneliness and lack of structured activity, are connected. Students need a compelling reason to return to campus, be it a structured course, an independent internship or volunteer opportunity, or a series of day trips and cultural activities, and if more students stayed on campus then loneliness would decrease. Yes, students who stayed on campus over winter break often reported that the trek to Annenberg often discouraged them from eating there altogether—but eating in one’s House is only truly beneficial if there are a critical mass of people to form a J-term community.
We encourage the administration to consider changes to the January Term sooner rather than later. While we support the Undergraduate Council for pushing for more faculty involvement with OWAW activities on the behalf of the student body, it is necessary to stress how time sensitive this matter is. Early notice would be helpful not only to students but also to faculty members, whose prominent reputations often ensure that their schedules are overbooked months beforehand. The push towards more faculty-led programming will ultimately go to waste if faculty members have too little time to plan such programs.  Last year, an announcement regarding the dates of winter break was sent out in early April. Considering we are fast encroaching on this deadline, it is advisable for the administration to take action as quickly as possible.
In addition, information regarding January activities should be more widely publicized, preferably in one convenient central location. Many students reported either being unaware of OWAW opportunities or finding out about programs after application deadlines had passed. Additional programming or funding will be irrelevant if students are not given the information to access these resources. While we acknowledge that some of this miscommunication may have been due to the experimental nature of this first OWAW, it does not change the fact that this is a serious issue that deserves to be addressed.
Winter break should be an opportunity for students to relax and unwind, albeit in a productive way, and take advantage of the campus resources they might not have time for during the hectic fall or spring terms. To truly make this program a success, the administration should take concrete steps towards determining what the program can realistically provide and act quickly to allow students and faculty adequate opportunity to plan their time.

I’ve realized that trying to explain the entertainment in watching eight hours of people running 20 meters back and forth is a bit of a lost cause. To differentiate the sport from the noisy insect is even more difficult.
All the same, the International Cricket Council Cricket World Cup dominated much of the former Commonwealth nations over the past few months, with as many as over a billion people watching some matches. Like other international sports, cricket has historically played a diplomatic role in tying together sometimes-warring nations, pushing them to look past historic enmities to engage in friendly rivalry. For instance, Pakistan and India engaged in a series of “Goodwill Games” in 2007 and 2008 to repair severed diplomatic ties between the two nations.
The beauty of the World Cup, however, did not lie in its ability to unite fans across degrees of age and affiliation, though it did this indisputably well. The difference is that it proved that the sport has spawned a generation of ardent fans among those who grew up without even playing cricket. At Harvard, at least, the Currier Fishbowl and many other common viewing areas were packed with screaming undergraduates on the day of the final—many of whom learned to appreciate the game solely by watching their parents’ and grandparents’ undying and near-religious obsession with it.
For many Indian-Americans, cricket was always a bit of a novelty sport: one reserved for Indian television and radio announcers to go wild about, one for our parents to follow cultishly, and one that was relatively removed from our lives. We grew up playing basketball, baseball, football, soccer—but not cricket. In America, the half-day time difference and the lack of an environment that treated each Indian cricket match like a national holiday diminished the excitement and enthusiasm we could have felt.
But the World Cup was something different. Given that India had not won in nearly 30 years, the thirst for victory brought about a sense of nationalistic pride and unity even among those who were born and bred in the United States. The final was something that you had to experience live: setting our alarms for five a.m. to watch the match from start to finish, we could finally echo our families’ keen passion for the game. The fandom was real, and it was ours.
In India, watching cricket often meant having a samosa (or three) in hand with a steady supply of cool lassi to combat the heavy Indian heat. It meant looking for an electronics store showing the match on all its TVs as a crowd of taxi drivers huddled in front of the glass window to see the Indian team fight for the nation. At Harvard, it meant a solid group of early-bird, first-generation Americans waving Indian flags and screaming at a projector screen, possibly cheering louder for the Indian team than for Harvard at The Game.
A few uninitiated undergrads peeked into the Fishbowl to see the crowd that was cheering so loudly that those in the dining hall could palpably roll their eyes every time India even seemed to hit a four. These guys didn’t quite know what was going on—and, lost in the world of mid-offs, square, long stop and other esoteric vernacular, they left. We continued on, pasta falling out of our gaping mouths, as India won its first World Cup in 27 years. The crowd of observers came back—not to be entertained by the crazed Indian fans, outfitted with Indian flags as capes and vuvezelas, but to watch the game itself. And they nestled themselves right in front, amidst the screaming mass. They, too, cheered—and they enjoyed. It was a game for all.

Nearly two months have passed since the Crimson’s Fifteen Minutes magazine ran the anonymous piece “I Am Fine,” but as the semester switches gears, its resounding message about mental health is just as relevant. As “I Am Fine” illustrated, what we don’t always hear are the sincere doubts that go further than complaints, and question how it is humanly possible to take advantage of everything happening around campus in this final month. In 2004, Professor Barry Schwartz at Swarthmore College, published a strong answer to these gut-wrenching questions: The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less. Schwartz’s argument, that living in a world of opportunity can be paralyzing rather than liberating, speaks to life at Harvard enormously, and especially when considered alongside the overwhelming response to “I Am Fine.” However “obvious” their conclusions may seem, these brilliant writers both urge us to limit ourselves—in expense of energy and expectation of what we can accomplish—so that the lives we choose for ourselves will constantly satisfy us rather than disappoint.
Discussing his book, Schwartz asserts that “the official dogma of all Western industrial societies…runs like this: If we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.” Given that, in Western industrial societies, people generally have their basic needs taken care of by the government and their own occupations, what could be better than individual freedom? From Enlightenment philosophy to America’s unwavering commitment to freedom, this notion of the inherent goodness of freedom goes unchallenged, and perhaps rightly so.
According to Schwartz, however, the next part of the unquestionable tenet is the very part which brings us down: that “the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.” As Harvard students, we are certainly familiar with this idea; one of the most appealing and terrifying aspects of life at Harvard is the access it grants to absolutely anything. The weight of the permutations of lives one could lead on this campus is often crippling, if not paralyzing.
It can be easy enough to stay focused when the routine is straightforward: Class. Pset. Rehearsal. Essay. But what happens when we think about how we ended up where we are, and what we could have done differently? What if, outside Hilles, I had turned left instead of right at the Activities Fair? What if I’d known myself like I do now right when I came to Harvard? What if I hadn’t gone to Harvard? Speaking directly into the average student’s daily whirlwind of doubt, Schwartz’s book argues that “infinite choice is paralyzing”and “exhausting to the human psyche.” We set unreasonably high expectations, and then question and doubt every choice we make. Any student who has woken up with a chilling malaise will understand Schwartz’s point when they ask themselves, “What do I do now?”
The answer to this question that emerges both from Schwartz’s book and from “I Am Fine” is to limit yourself—and not the most intuitive thought to circulate among the ideologies of maximization and achievement permeating campus life. But there is much to be said for the simple mantra of active decision-making and total immersion in activities, whether they be academic, extracurricular, or social. Otherwise, as a blockmate of mine once told me, “If you think about Harvard in terms of opportunity costs, you’re always going to be miserable.” We need to remember that what keeps Harvard thriving is not that every student takes advantage of every single opportunity. Rather, Harvard’s beauty lies in each student’s ability to pursue what he or she cares about, and find friends with shared interests, no matter how nestled the niche. The writer of “I Am Fine” vouches for such equilibrium reached through limitation: “By concentrating my energy on the people and activities that I care most about, I have gradually begun to get past all Harvard has taken and realized just how much it can give.” If we are bound to maximize our freedom by maximizing choice, we can end the cycle of doubt by choosing one, or a few, out of many options and committing ourselves to what we have chosen. After all, engagement is much more satisfying than regret. Schwartz ends his book by emphasizing the merits of “choice within constraints” and “freedom within limits.” As student expectations and anxieties swirl in the last month of the academic year, we would do well to remember this simple philosophy.

Say what you will about the Republican Path to Prosperity, it would make early April a lot less stressful. Last week the House Budget Committee approved Chairman Paul D. Ryan, Jr.’s fiscal year 2012 budget, which would dramatically curtail tax expenditures—special tax rules including credits, deductions, and exemptions that subsidize health insurance, pension contributions, mortgage payments, and a host of other private spending. This reform would substantially reduce the time and money people spend preparing their taxes, as well as the market distortions created by the tax code. But the resulting revenue increase would be used to lower tax rates. Ryan’s proposal gets it half right. While closing loopholes would make the tax code more efficient and equitable, the budget crisis demands that the new revenue be used mainly for deficit reduction.
Foregone revenue from tax loopholes doesn’t appear in appropriations bills, but the majority of nondefense discretionary spending is done through the tax code. Tax expenditures amounted to over $1 trillion in fiscal year 2010, compared to $2.2 trillion in total federal receipts.
Unlike increases in marginal tax rates, cuts in tax expenditures do not reduce incentives to work, save, and invest and can enhance efficiency by lessening distortions of private spending decisions. The exclusion of employer contributions to health insurance, one of the biggest loopholes, generates over-consumption of medical care by allowing employees to purchase insurance with pre-tax dollars, and has contributed to skyrocketing health care spending. The deductibility of mortgage interest has sparked excess demand for homes and helped cause the housing bubble of the past decade. Eliminating these and other perverse incentives would allow income to be allocated to its most efficient use.
Another efficiency gain comes from the reduction in tax compliance costs. The National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent office within the Internal Revenue Service, estimates that Americans spent $163 billion in 2008 preparing their income taxes, which amounts to 11 percent of tax receipts. Simplifying the tax code by eliminating special rules would reduce compliance costs, freeing up time and resources for productive activity.
While Ryan’s proposal has been roundly criticized for reducing the deficit on the backs of the poor, its broader tax base would come disproportionately at the expense of the wealthy. The Washington-based Tax Policy Center explains that tax expenditures raise after-tax income more for the wealthy than the poor, largely because high-income citizens are more likely to participate in subsidized activities like homeownership, consumption of employer-sponsored health insurance, and retirement saving. The bulk of the revenue gains from curtailing these programs would come from the top of the income distribution.
Ryan leaves the details of the tax reform effort to the House Ways and Means Committee, and some have criticized him for failing to identify tax expenditures he would cut. But targeting specific loopholes is unnecessary, says Harvard economist Martin S. Feldstein, since Congress could simply cap the total benefit taxpayers can receive from the combined effect of different tax expenditures. Feldstein and Daniel R. Feenberg of the National Bureau of Economic Research estimate that limiting an individual’s benefit from combined tax expenditures, excluding among others the earned-income tax credit that benefits the poor, to two percent of adjusted gross income could reduce the 2011 deficit by 17 percent. An across-the-board cap would substantially reduce distortions and compliance costs while avoiding the political difficulty of targeting specific tax rules that favor certain industries.
The problem with Ryan’s tax reform plan is that it would “not be for the purpose of increasing total tax revenues”—new revenues would be used to enhance growth by lowering tax rates. This would be a fine idea under less dire fiscal circumstances, since raising the same amount of revenue with a broader tax base and lower rates reduces the decline in production that occurs as a side-effect of every tax. But the complex challenge of bringing the budget into long-term balance, particularly with respect to health care spending, demands that most if not all the additional revenue be used for deficit reduction until the budget reaches a sustainable trajectory.
Of course, many Republicans do not concede that lower tax rates depress revenues. The Path to Prosperity identifies economic growth as the “biggest driver of revenue to the federal government,” an expression of the myth that cutting taxes from their current rates would actually boost revenue by stimulating economic growth. While this was certainly true of the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s, the center-right Tax Foundation explains that “hardly any economists” would agree that cutting today’s comparatively low rates would increase revenues, and that the argument “amounts to little more than wishful thinking.”
Ryan has the right intuition that the goal of tax policy should be to maximize economic growth—not government revenue. In the coming years, however, continued growth depends critically on our ability to rein in the monstrous long-term deficit. Revenue increases in the form of reduced tax expenditures are part of the solution, along with postponement of rate cuts for the foreseeable future.

The Harvard Office for Sustainability hosted the second annual Green Carpet Awards yesterday afternoon, honoring green initiatives launched by University students, faculty, and staff.
Held in Sanders Theatre with an actual green carpet laid across the stage, the event celebrated campus-wide environmental efforts and recognized the successful work of Harvard-affiliated students, faculty, and staff.
Sixty-one awards were given to a variety of projects in categories ranging from renewable energy to water and waste.
Winners were selected from 12 different Harvard schools and departments as well as Harvard Campus Services and the Central Administration.
“We’ve made significant progress that would not have been possible without deeply committed individuals in our schools and departments,” said University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp in her opening remarks.
One winning project was a steam and solar system in Canaday Hall that is expected to heat 60 percent of Harvard Yard.
Another initiative enabled Harvard undergraduate volunteers teach environmental issues to students in local elementary and middle schools.
Award presenters included a variety of distinguished faculty members and staff who came to express their support for environmental projects.
The event falls in the context of the Office of Sustainability’s celebration of “Earth Month” and Harvard’s increased focus on environmental issues.
Robert S. Kaplan, a professor at the Harvard Business School and an award presenter, praised the University’s success in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent since 2006, as part of its initiative “Green is the new Crimson.”
Presenting the Spengler-Vautin Special Achievement Award, the highest honor given at this ceremony, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith focused on work still to be done, and Harvard’s responsibility going forward.
“We can never underestimate the power of individuals,” Smith said. “Each of us has a role in confronting the challenges of our generation.”
Jackson S. Salovaara ’11, an individual award recipient and co-chair of the Environmental Action Committee, acknowledged the support of the administration and his peers.
“We have a bunch of really smart students who are committed to the environment, and it is very special to work with them,” Salovaara said.
Additional highlights of the afternoon included a performance by the Harvard Opportunes a cappella group and a student-produced music video spoofing Kanye West’s song, “All Of The Lights.”
Of the hundreds who attended the event, several expressed their enthusiasm for the environmental cause by wearing green costumes and apparel. Others were surprised and inspired by what they saw.
“It’s great for the university to recognize and live it’s values,” said Mark W. Robertson, who is a development and alumni communications manager at Harvard Graduate School of Education.
“The range and scope of the work that was presented was truly impressive,” he added.

The number of college students nationwide presenting symptoms of severe psychological problems has been on the rise in recent years, according to an annual study conducted by the Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors.
But the incidence of such conditions has remained flat at Harvard, according to information provided by Paul J. Barreira, director of behavioral health and academic counseling for University Health Services.
According to an emailed statement from Barreira, a detailed annual survey of Harvard freshman—first administered in 2007—has found that reported rates of depression, anxiety, and other psychological conditions have remained unchanged.
Furthermore, while the AUCCCD reported anxiety and depression as students’ leading complaints, Harvard students have cited stress as the biggest factor hindering their emotional health since the year 2000, according to Barreira.
The different psychological profile of the Harvard student body may be attributable to a number of diverse causes.
Compared to some other universities, Harvard provides more mental health resources on a per student basis.
Student-to-staff ratios at college campus health centers across the country have remained stable, on average, at roughly 1,786 students to one staff member, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
By contrast, according to a 2009 Crimson article, University Health Services at Harvard offers one staff member per 700 students.
Barreira noted that UHS Mental Health Services also increases its staff for the final five weeks of the semester in order to help students during the most demanding periods of the academic year.
Mental Health Services has also increased its staff during the school year, as compared to the summer, in order to ensure that it has all of the resources necessary to accommodate student requests.
In contrast, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, many campuses nationwide have only recently begun to expand the psychological resources that their schools offer, and many of these institutions reported that the psychiatric services remained insufficient.
Barreira noted that as finals draw near, students should remain conscientious of potential stresses and seek out support from their family and friends.
“Keeping yourself in contact with friends [and] maintaining social connections is vital at times when we fell particularly overwhelmed or alone,” Barreira wrote.

The Cambridge City Council held an informal roundtable last night to discuss improvements and modifications to the City’s website.
City Manager Robert W. Healy and members of Cambridge’s Information Technology Department presented the council with a series of updates to the city’s website that aim to make interaction with local government more accessible and user-friendly.
The Assessing Department has made all of its property data and GIS information—a form of electronic geographic information—publicly accessible, integrating the data to connect with outside sources such as Google Maps.
Both the municipal and public library websites have been improved to allow users to search for events by type and location.
Political junkies can now live-stream the City Council Meetings on their iPhones or embed meeting video segments into email messages or blog posts.
Vice Mayor Henrietta S. Davis, who chaired the roundtable, used her iPhone to illustrate the functionality of the new website.
Various city entities, such as the Arts Council and the library, are using social media such as Facebook and Twitter to update residents about upcoming events. The Department of Public Works is also piloting a program for residents to report potholes online.
Councilor Marjorie C. Decker asked the administration to look in to integrating ways in which constituents can track complaints and interact with local officials. Healy responded that more time was needed to design a system that could filter complaints and, if applicable, direct them to relevant agencies.
When Decker questioned the city manager as to why Boston has a more advanced complaint system, Healy responded that “[Boston has] a better PR system,” adding that Boston’s Citizens Connect is also quite basic.
“At some point, producing data produces more work than doing the work,” Healy said.
“Work with me here,” said Decker as she asked the administration to produce a clearer timeline for new program development. City officials responded that development of other reporting methods would be easy after the initial pilot program.
Councilor Leland Cheung, who blogged about the meeting beforehand, followed up on the conversation adding that the IT Department is “chronically underfunded” compared to other city resources.
“To be an open and accessible government, we need to meet people where they are, and where they are is online,” Cheung said.
Councilor Craig E. Kelley said that acting on resident complaints is more important than tracking complaint statuses.
“I think we’ll go broke if we are trying to keep up with technology,” he said.
No votes were taken at last night’s roundtable discussion.

As the first days of spring bring warm weather and blossoming flowers to the Cambridge area once again, plant scientists at the Arnold Arboretum have a lot to celebrate.
The recent opening of the Weld Hill Research Building added 44,000 square feet of space in a center featuring state-of-the-art equipment and lab space for the scientists working with the Arboretum.
The building, which is located near the Arboretum in Boston at 1300 Center Street, was given its final approvals by the city of Boston in December, and  researchers have been in the process of moving to the new facility since January.
“The great thing about the expansion is that we’re actually bringing all of our research into one location. Previously, they were scattered throughout labs in Cambridge, not even in the same building, not being anywhere near the Arboretum,” said Faye M. Rosin, the laboratory administrator for the new facility. “This allows everyone to be in one place, where you can have interaction, you can just walk outside, go collect some materials, and just use them in your experiment.”
The Director of the Arnold Arboretum, William “Ned” Friedman, echoed this sentiment.
“It’s all about bringing the research mission, which has been here at the Arnold Arboretum for over a century, to the highest level of having the laboratory facilities right here on site,” said Friedman. “It allows us to invite the world in, invite Harvard undergraduates here.”
There are already many active research projects at the facility, according to Rosin, including studies in evolution of floral organs, relations between trees of the gymnosperm plants, and water relations in plants.
Friedman will be offering a freshman seminar in the Fall. The class will make use of the Weld Hill facility as it recreates some of Darwin’s experiments. The seminar will use of the laboratory equipment, although labs are only open to graduate research. According to Rosin, undergraduate teaching labs are under development and should be available in the near future.
The facility includes twelve greenhouses, plant growth chambers, laboratories, and administrative offices with room for 48 researchers and assistants, plus space for administrators and staff.
“What this really represents is a greater sort of integration of the Arnold Arboretum with the teaching and research positions that have always been a part of Harvard’s mission, now with a building to put it all in,” Friedman said.
The building was also designed to be environmentally friendly, according to the Arboretum’s website. Among other sustainable features, it incorporates a subterranean geothermal heat exchange system.
The Arboretum, part of Boston’s “Emerald Necklace” of parks, sits on 265 acres of land in the Jamaica Plain and Roslindale neighborhoods of Boston, and contains 15,052 separate species of plants, with emphasis on woody species of North America and eastern Asia, according to its website.
Although the park is privately managed by Harvard as its own department, the land is owned by the City of Boston and used by the University under a 1,000-year lease.

Described as intrepid, resilient, resourceful, and intelligent by friends and professors, Clare M. Gillis, a recent Harvard graduate who was captured last Tuesday while working as a freelance reporter to cover the violence in Libya, remains hostage at a government detention center in Tripoli.
Gillis was detained outside the city of Brega, where a car carrying Gillis and three other journalists was taken over by forces loyal to Muammar Gaddafi.
Gillis was spotted at the detention center in Tripoli with two of the journalists captured, according to media reports. The status of a South African photographer who was also captured, Anton Hammerl, is unknown.
Alexander More, who is friends with Gillis, said that she “has to get the hell out of there.”
“It haunts my dreams. I can’t even imagine,” said More, a history teaching fellow who knew Gillis for six years.
Sitting in front of two computer screens with news constantly updating, More called for immediate action by the Harvard community to bring her back.
“She served our community for 10 years as graduate student and teaching fellow. She should absolutely be on the mind of the [University] administration.” said More, frowning.
The White House called for the release of the journalists at a press briefing yesterday.
“We’re very aware of this issue, and I know the State Department is working very hard in order to do what it can to facilitate those journalists’ release,” said Jay Carney, President Obama’s press secretary. “We take this very, very seriously, as we did when other journalists were detained.”
As of yesterday, the Libyan government has not acknowledged the detention of the journalists. Sources in Libya said that the journalists were being treated well by the government, according to The Atlantic.
Yet, friends and acquaintances of Gillis remain deeply concerned.
“You don’t expect the worst to happen,” said Ece G. Turnator, a graduate student in the history department. “God knows what she’s going through, which is kind of scary.”
Since the news about Gillis’ capture spread last week, friends of Gillis have been organizing to secure her release. Jeffrey R. Webb and Elizabeth W. Mellyn, both Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences graduates and close friends of Gillis, created a Facebook page called “Friends for the Release of Clare Gillis” to facilitate sharing updates of Gillis’ situation.
“This is not only a place to communicate with friends and share information, but a way of keeping the matter out there,” said Mellyn, who is currently on a year-long fellowship in Villa I Tatti, a Harvard research institute in Italy.
The History Department issued a news brief last Friday about the capture of Gillis, who was a history adviser in Adams House during the 2008-2009 academic year.
Gillis completed her master’s degree through the Harvard Germanic Languages and Literatures Department in 2003, and her Ph.D. in medieval history this spring. All the while, she interacted with other students, both as an adviser in Adams and as the TF of nine undergraduate courses.
“One of Clare’s favorite things to do on a nice day in spring was sitting on steps of Widener to philosophize and discuss current events with undergraduates,” Webb said.
After graduation, Gillis decided to travel around the Middle East and Asia, visiting countries like Israel, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Indonesia, and India.
“She is one of those scholars and educated people who have harnessed her education and passion for history and current events to serve the public,” More said.
Later on, Gillis went to Egypt and Libya to report on the revolutions.
“When she heard about the Egyptian revolution, she was really on fire about it. She went to Egypt to watch the revolution happening, and she was in Tahrir Square for a lot of it,” said Mellyn.
“[Gillis] doesn’t have the backing of a publication like the New York Times,” Turnator said. “We’ve been trying to mobilize alumni and apply pressure in any way we can on both local and international authorities.”
Professors have also become involved in the efforts, reaching out to the University administration, NGOs, and government organizations to call for Gillis’ release.
History Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger said he sent an email to University President Drew G. Faust about Gillis’ capture over the weekend, and Michael McCormick, a professor of medieval history who worked closely with Gillis as her adviser, said he personally urged Senator John F. Kerry to prioritize Gillis’ release and encouraged other people to register their concerns with Kerry and Senator Scott P. Brown.
McCormick pointed out that Gillis’ case is indicative of “a terrifying trend of the past decades of evil forces to snuff out journalists.”
The State Department, Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists, GlobalPost, and the Turkish government are working together to compel the release of the journalists.
“It is important for the people who have her to know that there’s a large group around the world who care about the fate of this young woman,” said McCormick.

Despite media criticism and some faculty disquiet, the University has stayed mum on University Professor Michael E. Porter’s involvement in crafting a report commissioned by the Libyan government under Muammar Gaddafi.
In the 2006 report, Porter claimed that Libya was a democracy—a conclusion that former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 criticized during a Faculty meeting last week. Lewis said that Porter’s financial ties to Gaddafi colored his analysis of the Libyan regime.
The Globe, which has been covering the controversy over the past few days, published a staff editorial yesterday that encouraged University Drew G. Faust to publicly condemn Porter.
“Harvard needs to zealously protect the freedom of speech and expression of those in its community,” the staff editorial said. “But it shouldn’t be afraid to draw some sharp lines to prevent violations of human rights.”
The Globe highlighted Faust’s strong advocacy for gay rights, noting that she has taken principled stands in the past and should be willing to do the same with regard to Porter.
Several professors said that they largely understand Lewis’ statements, but they sympathize with Faust’s hesitation to use her position to publicly condemn Porter.
While University Professor Stanley Hoffmann said that, based on Lewis’ statements, he found Porter’s actions to be “revolting,” he nonetheless expressed concerns about censuring Porter.
“I am not sure I would want to whip him in public,” Hoffmann said, adding that he nonetheless believes there should be “limits” to professors’ actions that might reflect negatively on Harvard.
Professors also expressed concerns that rebuking Porter would establish a worrying precedent.
“I can understand Professor Lewis’s concerns,” said Professor Jeffrey A. Miron, director of undergraduate studies for economics.
“[But] if the president started taking a stand on faculty activities or positions, there would be an endless series of issues to address.”
In the Faculty meeting last week, Lewis said that Porter’s actions were “wrong,” arguing that the University professor allowed for financial ties with the government to influence the report’s published findings.
But Porter said in an emailed statement to The Crimson last week that his research and the report were completed between 2004 and 2006, a period during which the future of the nation looked more optimistic.
Porter said that Libya was at the time opening up to the Western world and making reparations for former behavior.
Faust has not followed up on comments she made regarding the controversy at last week’s Faculty meeting, in which she said that it was not high on the President’s list of responsibilities to serve as “scolder-in-chief.”
“What is high on the list,” Faust said at the meeting, “is to allow for people to say what they think.”
University spokesperson Kevin Galvin said yesterday that the University backs Faust’s statement.
In the Faculty meeting, Lewis encouraged the president to consider criticizing professors for outside behavior that paints Harvard in poor light.
Lewis condemned Porter in strong language, saying that Porter had been swayed by financial incentives and that  Porter had claimed the government was a democracy “for a price.”
The 2006 report was compiled by the Monitor Consulting Group, a firm established by several Harvard Business School professors, including Porter, in 1983.
The document repeatedly referred to the Libyan government, which had been led by Gaddafi since 1969, as a “democracy,” and lauded the government for its Westernization efforts.
Porter said that after 2007, when he came to believe that reform had halted, he cut associations with Libya.

While a recently-released report from the American Association of University Professors indicated that across the board faculty salaries still reflect a depressed fiscal environment, professors in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences will continue to receive 2 percent annual salary increases.
However, Harvard has not been immune to the effects of the weak economy.
Similar to many peer institutions, Harvard continues to maintain fewer active faculty searches for tenure track positions than it did before the 2008 financial crisis.
The salary increases—while a welcome respite from the pay freeze imposed between 2008 and 2009—still pale in comparison to the five percent year-on-year raises that faculy members received prior to 2008.
During the crisis, Harvard’s endowment plummeted 30 percent in value, dropping from a high of $37 billion to a low of $26 billion.
As a result, the monetary endowment payout to FAS fell nineteen percent over two years from its pre-2008 high of $650 million. FAS derives roughly half of its operating budget from this payout.
Standing in a packed room of faculty in Dec. 2008, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced staff and faculty salary freezes, and recommended that each department trim its budget by 10 to 15 percent.
What we have to do is plan for expense reduction,” Smith said at the time.
The salary freezes were lifted after a year, in December of 2009, and “merit-based salary increases” of 2 percent per year were instated.
“While we continue to operate in a constrained fiscal environment, the FAS will, as always, work to be a competitive employer so that we can continue to attract the most talented faculty and staff,” FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an emailed statement.
In an interview yesterday, University Professor Stanley Hoffmann said that—despite the thawing of the pay freeze—Harvard professors should not consider salaries a primary concern.
“I think, on the whole, it is unseemly for academics to worry too much about their salaries,” Hoffmann said, noting that professors are quite affluent compared to the majority of the population.
But the AAUP report released yesterday still aggressively emphasized that professor salaries rose, on average, only 1.4 percent in the past year—considerably below the hikes that Harvard awarded.
The AAUP concluded that these low year-on-year gains reflected little confidence in the current “global knowledge economy.”
In budgets for fiscal year 2012 submitted to academic divisions in the beginning of March, department administrators were told to increase salaries even further for unionized workers—to 3.15 percent.
A 4 percent increase in the endowment distribution value will help fund most of these continued salary increases.

Christopher Yanov, founder of the mentorship group Reality Changers, critiqued current gang-violence prevention practices, promoting an alternative approach that focused on providing young people with options outside of gangs, in a talk in Adams Lower Common Room yesterday.
Yanov spent the majority of his speech criticizing current approaches to preventing gang violence.
“Prevention, Intervention, Suppression,” he said, rattling off the mantra of most gang-prevention groups.
Instead, Yanov proposed a different theory for preventing gang violence, which he called “Provide, Understanding, Transcend.”
“When you provide more options for [challenged youth], they come to the understanding that they have choices and then can transcend the [gang violence] in their neighborhood,” Yanov told the audience.
Reality Changers, a mentorship program that encourages first-generation college attendance, has helped its students attain over $15 million in scholarship money and claims a 100 percent college attendance rate for children who complete the program.
Yanov’s talk was co-sponsored by several Harvard diversity groups including the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations. Jesse G. Sanchez ’13, a former mentee of Yanov and graduate of Reality Changers, introduced the event.
Yanov recounted anecdotes from working with “challenged youth” in what he called the “probation capitol” of San Diego. He also criticized what he called typical prevention programs’ inadvertent advertising of gangs in their well-intentioned efforts to reduce gang violence, saying that he initially made the same mistake when he began trying to help inner city youth.
“Gang prevention programs, they don’t work because they are unintentionally advertising those negative behaviors,” he said.
Students who attended the event said that while Yanov had beneficial strategies towards gang prevention, much of what he proposed would not lead to widespread improvement.
“It is giving real options to youth,” said Karla Reyes ’11. “But I don’t think it was grass roots enough—change needs to come from parents and youth. It’s not sustainable on a large scale.”
But Sanchez said that he believed the event was a great educational opportunity for members of the Harvard community.
“This is a great chance for Harvard to see what the issue of gang violence consists of,” he said. “This issue impacts the Harvard community and beyond.”

The current draft of the federal budget for the last six months of fiscal year 2011, in an agreement reached by Congress over the weekend, calls for significant cuts in research and education, which may impact Harvard’s ability to fund its programs.
The bill has maintained the $5,550 maximum amount awarded through Pell Grants, a federal program that provides funding for low-income undergraduates. Approximately 17 percent of eligible Harvard students received Pell Grants in 2010.
However, a policy that allowed students to receive two Pell Grants in one year has been discontinued.
The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, which also help low-income students pay for college, were cut by $20 million.
Funds allocated for the National Institutes of Health were cut by $260 million, and the National Science Foundation’s funding was cut by $53 million.
Harvard received over $600 million in federal funding for research in fiscal year 2010, according to the University’s annual fiscal report.
“These cuts are significant, and will impact scientific research and educational opportunities,” Kevin Casey, Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations, wrote in an emailed statement.
“However, strong voices have been raised in this debate about the importance of scientific research and education to our long-term economic vitality,” Casey wrote. “We are working hard to assure that more voices join in the effort in the weeks and months ahead—to preserve these programs—they are critical to our ongoing economic wellbeing as a nation.”
Congress is expected to pass the bill this week. Overall, the bill has cut the federal budget by nearly $40 billion—the largest cut in federal spending in a single year to date.
In addition, AmeriCorps—a national community service organization which helps to fund Teach for America—suffered a $23 million cut, narrowly escaping Republican efforts to eliminate the program. Last year Teach for America saw the highest number of Harvard applicants in history. From the Class of 2010, 293 seniors applied.
With the 2011 budget drafted, Congress will soon shift gears to hammer out the 2012 fiscal budget. President Obama’s 2012 budget proposal, released in February, includes funding increases for science research and continued support for student financial aid.
Obama’s budget proposed a two and a half percent increase in funding for NIH and a 13 percent boost for the NSF.
Obama’s budget also sustains the Federal Pell Grant Program for college students, keeping the maximum grant amount at $5,550.

Harvard is solidifying plans to lead one of the largest national efforts to create a digitized public library.
The proposed Digital Public Library of America will serve as an open online collection of digitized books and texts that project leaders hope could one day incorporate every volume ever published.
Guided by a Steering Committee at the Harvard Law School’s Berkman Center for Internet and Society, the project remains in its initial planning phase. But in the wake of a New York District Court’s ruling last month against the Google Books Library Project, citing concerns of monopoly power, the spotlight has fallen on the DPLA, which will allow free access to the volumes.
There is a “need to pivot very quickly from the discussion phase to the implementation phase,” said Harvard Law Professor John G. Palfrey ’94, a co-director of the Berkman Center and a leader in the DPLA project.
The DPLA will be the product of a collaboration between the largest library systems in the nation, already including Harvard, the Library of Congress, the National Archives, and the Smithsonian Institution.
“The promise of the idea is attracting a lot of people at least to be involved even if they are skeptical of our ability to pull it off,” he said. “We have many of the biggest players at the table.”
If implemented successfully, the project will “make the cultural and scientific heritage of humanity available, free of charge, to all,” according to its online concept note.
Paul N. Courant, a member of the steering committee and a professor at the University of Michigan, said that he thought “success over some period is almost inevitable.”
The project received planning-stage support in December when it secured a $125,000 start-up fund from the New York-based Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
But despite current enthusiasm, the scope of the project humbles even the leaders behind it. And members of the Steering Committee still say that the DPLA is in too early a stage to provide a set time-frame for the project.
“There is a sense that we ought to do things relatively quickly,” Courant said. “I think we should make substantial progress by this calendar year.”
Once the proposal goes into implementation phase, the Steering Committee must scan a large number of printed materials, negotiate with various publishers on copyright protected materials, and deal with a multi-million dollar annual operating budget.
For example, Europeana—a multi-lingual collection of millions of digitized items from European museums, libraries, and other archives—runs an annual operating cost of $7.1 million, according to company reports.
But Palfrey said that Europeana did not engage in costly digitization efforts, which could require hundreds of millions of dollars.
Before reaching the digitization phase, the Steering Committee must still pursue more partnerships with other major national library systems.
According to Palfrey, the committee hopes to host a “very large-scale” event in Washington, D.C. this fall in order to bring together the larger community of stakeholders.
Project organizers have invited the public to an open discussion regarding strategies for improving access to online resources.
Potential stakeholders can stay up to date on the project’s progress by going to its crowd-sourced website where organizers solicit comments.
“Scores of people have been contributing,” said Jerome J. McGann, a member of the Steering Committee and professor from the University of Virginia.
“There are many ideas in play [and] there is nothing hidden right now,” McGann added.
Back in 2005, the University agreed to let Google scan 850,000 volumes that were in the public domain.
Harvard disassociated with the project in 2008, when the company approached Harvard to expand its digitization efforts to include the libraries’ remaining 15 million volumes, which were under copyright protection.
According to Director of the Harvard Library Robert C. Darnton ’60, while Google agreed to pay for the digitization of the books, the firm was not covering costs of transporting the volumes—which would have cost around $1.9 million.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last season’s matchup against Brown, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team fought back from a seven-goal deficit but was unable to finish the comeback, falling, 11-10.
This year, Crimson sophomore midfielder Danielle Tetreault made sure that history didn’t repeat itself.
Tetreault tallied a game-high five goals to jumpstart a successful rally and to help the Crimson to a critical 12-9 win at Brown last Friday.
“[Tetreault] started us off and brought us back in the game,” tri-captain Sam McMahon said. “She was incredible on both ends of the field.”
Determined to strike early, Tetreault scored Harvard’s first two goals off of free-position shots in the opening five minutes of the game.
But for the majority of the first half, the Crimson struggled to find offensive opportunities, and the Bears jumped out to a 7-2 lead with 4:44 left in the half.
Just when it seemed that the Crimson was headed for another disappointing loss to the Bears, Tetreault and the other Harvard players took a stand.
The sophomore trio of Tetreault, Jennifer VanderMeulen, and Nina Kucharczyk each scored once within a span of two minutes, cutting Brown’s lead to two before halftime.
“It was a big Ivy game,” Tetreault said. “We put a few goals away and just kept it going.”
Tetreault began the second half in attack mode, scoring two quick goals less than seven minutes in to even the score at seven. That left her teammates with ample time to continue the charge and put the Bears away.
“We knew that was a critical moment,” junior Jess Halpern said. “That goal from [Tetreault] was huge. We knew we needed to build on that and continue the momentum.”
“I think all of her goals just proved that we could win,” Kucharczyk added. “She shot five-for-six, and that game-tying goal just showed us that we needed to keep going. She was the momentum builder and the uniting force.”
Feeding off of Tetreault’s energy, the Crimson scored five more goals and kept the Bears scoreless until garbage time.
“It was a much-needed win for us,” Tetreault said. “We made a few mistakes in the first half and went down by a few goals. But when we were able to get more draw controls and offensive chances, we were able to put the ball away.”
After scoring 20 goals and tallying 10 assists in her freshman year, Tetreault continues to serve as a reliable all-around player for Harvard.
She is currently the Crimson’s second-leading scorer and is tied for first on the team with three assists.
But among all of her talents, her speed and agility may be the most impressive.
“Danielle is one of the best dodgers on our team,” McMahon said. “She can lull you to sleep and just take off [suddenly]. She’s very deceptive and quick to gain positioning in both the front and the side. If [the opponent] leaves her a gap, she’ll take it.”
Those skills were on full display Friday night, even though Tetreault injured her knee in last Sunday’s game against Virginia.
“She’s a warrior,” Kucharczyk said. “She was running up and down the field and taking the ball to the goal.”
“It was her first day coming back,” Halpern added. “But she was still explosive...She killed it.”
Tetreault’s fight is one of the reasons Harvard has been able to battle back from a number of deficits this season.
“We never give up,” Tetreault said. “We have great coaches. When they see something wrong, they help us slow things down by explaining what needs to change.”
After Harvard barely missed out on last season’s Ivy League tournament, Tetreault feels her squad has matured and is ready to take the next step.
“We’re playing with a lot more experience this year,” Tetreault said. “We’re still a young team, but we have a group of players who have been in similar situations. That helped us step up and turn it around.”
Currently 3-1 in Ivy League play, the Crimson is one win away from clinching a postseason berth—a prospect that has Tetreault and her teammates very excited.
“That’s definitely a huge goal for our team this year,” Tetreault said. “Last year, we were put in a position in which we were relying on another team to beat another team in order for us to get in. Now we’re putting ourselves in control and no longer relying on other teams’ records to make the tournament.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following strong showings over the past two weekends, the Harvard sailing team looked to build upon its success this weekend in the 29th Marchiando and 51st Friis Trophies Team Race at Tufts and MIT, and the Central Series Four at home.
Though the team started off poorly in the opening rounds on Saturday at Tufts, the Crimson was able to turn it around quickly enough to force its way into the next round of races on Sunday at MIT. The squad even had a shot at winning the gold before being edged out of the final round by Boston College, ending the weekend in third place.
This weekend was full of crosstown and Ancient Eight rivalry, as Harvard faced Boston University, MIT, Northeastern, Yale, Brown, and Dartmouth in the Marchiando.
“College sailing is really good around the Boston area,” senior Alan Palmer said. “So we end up racing against a lot of good teams and sometimes people that we practice against.”
29th MARCHIANDO & 51st FRIIS TROPHIES TEAM RACE
On Saturday, the Crimson struggled to gain all-important early victories in its full double-round robin, winning only one of its first five races due to an inability to adjust to the variable conditions.
“Sailing at Tufts is almost mystical in that it has both shifty winds and a shifty river,” Palmer said. “We definitely had an abysmal start, but we were able to turn it around in the afternoon.”
Harvard was able to make the much-needed adjustments, and won enough races to find a spot in the Sunday competitions with a few come-from-behind victories.
The conditions were much better for the Crimson on Sunday, as it returned to the Charles River with the familiar wind and water of a home course.
Though the College of Charleston was superior to all other teams, gaining a decisive 11-3 record in the round-robin, the Eagles and Harvard still had the opportunity to win.
As the rounds came to a close, so did the chance to race head-to-head against the Cougars, and all that stood between Harvard and an opportunity for a first-place finish was the team that edged it out last year for the 2010 Fleet Racing National Championship.
Boston College beat out Harvard in their race, pushing the Crimson into a third-place finish behind the Eagles and the College of Charlseton in the regatta.
“In general, we were pretty happy that we were able to take third place after that bad start,” Palmer said. “We had a shot at winning, but we just lost a couple class races.”
CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Harvard’s freshmen—along with sophomore Nick Gordon and junior Grant Wonders—also participated in the Central Series Four Conference regatta on Saturday and Sunday, hosting and competing against eleven other colleges from the Northeast.
The Crimson was fortunate not to face similar weather conditions as its upperclassmen counterparts had faced on Saturday, with only a slight breeze to disrupt the boats.
“We had beautiful conditions with it being warm and sunny, but on Saturday the wind was somewhat tricky,” freshman Ben Lamont said. “[The wind] was much better on Sunday though.”
The conference regatta was split into two divisions, with Harvard freshmen Ames Lyman, Luke O’Connor and Alice Kenney in the A-division, and Lamont, Grant Wonders, and Nicholas Gordon competing in the B-Division.
Each division competed in six races on Saturday and another six on Sunday.
The A-Division started off well with two top finishes on Saturday, but the Crimson fell to a sixth-place finish Sunday.
“Lyman sailed really well for us this weekend, giving our team some much-needed first-place finishes,” Lamont said.
Despite garnering first- and second-place finishes on Sunday, the B-Division squad got off to a slow start and finished eighth overall.
Roger Williams University won the regatta, while the two Harvard teams combined to finish the weekend in sixth place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing start to the spring season, the Harvard women’s golf team failed to do much better in the first round of this weekend’s Spring Brown Bear Invitational, tallying a score of 306.
But something clicked for the Crimson yesterday.
Dropping 15 strokes, Harvard scored a 291, tied for the lowest mark of any school on the tournament’s final day.
The Crimson’s strong second day propelled the squad to a second-place finish, eight strokes behind Princeton in the two-day tournament at the Rhode Island Country Club in Barrington, R.I.
“I’m super pleased with how this weekend went,” captain Mia Kabasakalis said. “Obviously, a win would’ve been extra awesome, but the way today went, it felt like a win. We all just played phenomenally well today.”
Harvard’s performance in this week’s tournament comes after a tough eighth-place finish in last weekend’s Georgetown Invitational.
“We were extra motivated [this week] because we didn’t play as well as we would have liked last week,” said freshman Bonnie Hu, a Crimson business comper. “We were more focused about what we needed to work on and what we needed to get done.”
Perhaps no one turned around her game more than Hu. In her past three competitive matches, the freshman had logged a 79, an 82, and an 80, the three worst scores of her collegiate career. But in the tournament’s first day, Hu shot a team-low 74 and didn’t look back, shooting a 74 again the following day.
For the rest of the team, the tournament’s opening round was unremarkable, as the rest of the Harvard roster shot between a 77 and an 80.
After the tournament’s first day, a win would’ve been difficult, as the Tigers shot a 287 to take a commanding 18-stroke lead on second-place Yale.
“Princeton crushed it [Sunday],” Kabasakalis said. “We all knew that we needed to play really well.”
And that’s exactly what Harvard did.
Other than Hu, each Crimson player dropped her score by at least two strokes in the second day. Junior Christine Cho shot a 74, her best score since September, while freshman Fritzi Reuter had a career-best 74.
“Fritzi played great,” Kabasakalis said. “She missed a couple of short putts towards the end or she [would’ve] easily been under par.”
In fact, the team’s worst score yesterday would’ve been its second best on Sunday, and the Crimson threw out a 76 on the tournament’s final day.
“If we do that ever, that’s just a great day,” Kabsakalis said.
For Harvard, it was Kabasakalis who stole the show. The senior had a career-best two-under 70, and her two-day total of 147 was good for fifth-place overall.
But Kabasakalis’ day didn’t begin on the right foot.
Thanks to a three-putt and a mishit bunker shot in the first few holes, the senior found herself two over coming into the eighth hole.
“I started off with a couple of really, really stupid bogies,” Kabasakalis said.
An eagle on the eighth brought her back to even par. From there, she kept up her high level of play, draining three more birdies during the rest of her round.
“[Yesterday] felt awesome,” Kabasakalis said. “It was just fun to play. It felt easy. I just hope that I can keep that up in two weeks time.”
At least a portion of the team’s improvement from the first day to the second can be attributed to a change in conditions and an increase in familiarity with the course.
“It was kind of windy [Sunday],” Hu said. “But also, [yesterday], we knew what to expect when it came to the course. It’s easier when you’ve played a course a couple of times already.”
But mentally, something seemed to fall into place after Sunday’s round as well.
“Honestly, everyone felt more confident today,” Kabasakalis said. “[Sunday]’s scores—they were decent, but almost everyone came off the course and was like, ‘I could’ve dropped at least five shots.’ So people knew they could play well.”
From here, the team shifts its attention to the Ivy League Championships in two weeks. To win, the Crimson will have to beat tough Princeton and Yale teams and, perhaps more dauntingly, snap a year-long winless streak.
But if Harvard plays like it did yesterday, the team has upset potential come April 22.
“We’re moving in the right direction, and we’re going to do our best for Ivies,” Hu said. “All the practice we’ve been putting in has been paying off. Everything’s coming together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tommy Amaker will not be taking his talents to South Beach.
The Crimson men’s basketball coach turned down an offer for the same position at the University of Miami, opting to remain at Harvard.
“I am appreciative of and flattered by the interest shown in me by other fine universities, but I am proud and honored to represent Harvard,” Amaker said in a press release Tuesday. “I look forward to continuing my efforts to teach, lead and serve at this great institution.”
According to a report published on ESPN.com, University of Miami officials flew to Boston Monday in an attempt to woo Amaker, offering him a five-year contract worth $1.1 million per year.
The coach had signed a multi-year extension to remain at Harvard in 2010.
"We're all pretty excited that Coach Amaker has decided to stay," junior co-captain Keith Wright said Tuesday. "All the drama is done ... It's nice to just move on."
The Ivy League Player of the Year said he and his teammates had not yet heard from Amaker.
"We just read tweets and articles online—he hasn't spoken to us yet," Wright said.
De La Salle High School (Minn.) senior Jonah Travis, who has been accepted to Harvard and will join the squad next season, also confirmed that he has not yet spoken to anyone associated with the program.
On Monday, the Boston Globe’s college sports blog stated that “sources at Miami and Harvard said that Amaker was considering what he felt was a serious offer to become the Canes’ next coach.”
But the former Duke player and assistant coach declined the ACC offer on Tuesday. Amaker, whose name was linked to the vacancy at Georgia Tech earlier this year, has often spoken of his desire to establish the Harvard program over the long term with the aim of returning the Crimson to the NCAA tournament, which it has not made since 1946.
In just four years, he has taken a team that went 8-22 in Amaker’s first season and turned it into a legitimate mid-major contender. With no seniors departing from the squad that won a share of its first-ever Ivy League championship in 2010-11, the Crimson is expected to be the heavy favorite to win the Ivy League next season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball may have dropped another one to Northeastern this evening, but the Huskies, and especially the team’s catcher John Puttress, are still indebted to the Crimson.
That’s right. Today marks the 135th anniversary of Harvard’s greatest contribution to baseball: the catcher’s mask.
Along with countless contributions to the landscape of American sports, the story of the first catcher’s mask is one of the University’s proudest athletic achievements. It’s also one of its most contested, despite what’s written in Harvard’s Hall of Athletic History.
Inventor Frederick Thayer—no relation to the namesake of freshman dorm—was the manager of the 1876 Crimson baseball team. Over the winter term, with no practices to keep him occupied, Thayer constructed a catcher’s mask for teammate Alexander Tyng, who previously had little more protection than rubber bands around his teeth.
Using the wiring of an old fencing mask and animal skins for padding, Thayer revolutionized baseball.
After practicing a few times with the mask in the early spring, Tyng introduced baseball to the catcher’s mask on April 12, 1876, the first day of the season. Tyng, who typically had to jump out of the way of foul balls and was hit in the face several times in his career, made only two errors in the entire game, a remarkably low number, even for professionals at the time.
Needless to say, the mask was “a complete success.” The new equipment added “greatly to the confidence of the catcher, who need not feel that he is every moment in danger of a life-long injury,” according to an 1877 Crimson article.
Thayer graduated in 1878 and eventually patented his invention, but his story remains highly contended. To this today, some argue that Tyng actually invented the mask, and many particulars of the account remain unverifiable.
In the end, what matters is that the Crimson did it first, and the mask accomplished its goal on that Opening Day, as Harvard won its game 135 years ago.
And although the Crimson couldn’t walk away with the same success almost a century and a half after Tyng’s debut of the mask, Harvard baseball can still hold on to its history.

It may not be in-season for the Crimson’s women’s volleyball team, but that certainly has not kept it away from competition.
Last weekend, Harvard took part in a four-team tournament hosted by Boston College, in which the Crimson faced the Boston-based Eagles, Bryant, and the University of Connecticut. Harvard emerged from the weekend without dropping a match—drawing with Boston College, and beating the Bulldogs and the Huskies outright.
Last fall, Harvard fell to the Eagles, 3-0, and went on to finish with a 9-17 overall record. Although last weekend’s tournament had no bearing on the Crimson’s record, the draw against Boston College shows early potential for a strong 2011-12 campaign.
In addition to its tournaments, the team has been combining a mixture of weight training and practices three times a week to gain momentum for its upcoming season.
“All of our hard work in the offseason at practice and lifts has paid off at our first…tournament,” junior Christine Wu said. “It demonstrated what our team is capable of, especially when we are hungry for new competition and challenges.”
Graduating only two seniors and welcoming a solid incoming freshman class, Harvard has the opportunity to use its offseason tournaments to build and improve upon its showing last year.
“With our small group of 10 [players] this spring, we have already proven to be a force on the court,” Wu said. “Carrying [that] over into the fall with the addition of five great recruits, our…team will be looked at as one of the teams to beat in the [Ivy] league next year.”
Next weekend, the Crimson will face Holy Cross, Providence College, and Springfield in its second preliminary tournament.

"Your Highness"—the 87,395th movie starring Natalie Portman '03 released in the past year—is now in theaters. But just in case the prospect of seeing the Harvard-grad-turned-Oscar-winner slay dragons isn't enough to draw you into theaters, we should also point out that it is also the first big stoner movie of 2011.
So in honor of this momentous occasion, here is a list of the top five stoner movies available through Hollis, to be used for your procrastinating pleasure.
5) "Reefer Madness" – Okay, so stoner movies in the 1930s don't quite look like those that we know and love today. But if you can tune out all of the conservative propaganda, this film—arguably the first stoner movie of all time—is pretty hilarious. It can be found on a DVD from the Widener Depository called "The Madness Trilogy," which also includes films on cocaine fields and "sex madness."
4) "Lammbock" – Didn't know that German cinema had a place for stoner movies? It does, and this one's available in the Widener Depository. Broaden your range of stoner-movie repertoire and go cross-cultural! The director, Christian Zübert, was apparently inspired by Quentin Tarantino, so if you love Tarantino and German cinema, this will be a blast.
3) "Dude, Where’s My Car?" – Ashton Kutcher, in his breakout role, is the epitome of charming naïveté—or sort of hilarious stupidity. It's not clear whether back tattoos of the words "Dude" and "Sweet" fall under the former or the latter. Go check it out of Lamont.
2) "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle" – Check out this classic written by two Jersey boys straight out of high school. That, and because it refers to the dreaded med-school interview as a "non-issue" during this epic Anthony Anderson appearance. It's the ultimate procrastination-turned-adventure which makes it perfect reading-period material. Available from the Widener Depository and the Law School library.
1) "Pineapple Express" – An earlier project from the director of "Your Highness," David Gordon Green, this iconic stoner movie put him on the map and shot Seth Rogen even further into stardom. Additionally, James Franco co-stars as a stoner with exponentially more energy than what Franco himself managed to muster up for the Oscars. What a better way to prepare for Green’s new release? Go get it from the Widener Depository.

When Harvard students walk into the Coop, their main concern tends to be the price of textbooks, but some students have taken a greater interest in the bookstore. Ten Harvard students are currently running to join the 23-member board of the Harvard Cooperative Society. Although the Board can't lower the price of books, many of the candidates hope to open the lines of communication between the Coop and the student body.
"Students today need faster, easier access to information about what the Coop can do for us," said Sonia K. McNeil, the only law school student on the ballot. "By staying engaged and open to new ideas, the Coop can keep growing along with the community it serves."
Other candidates are drawn to the Coop because it provides the opportunity to participate in the operations of a fully functional business. Board members are in charge of making decisions ranging from the establishment of employee benefits to managing the Coop's real estate.
"It's one of the few opportunities on campus to serve on a real business board," said Melissa C. Oppenheim '12 who, if re-elected, will serve on the board for the third time next year. "I think it's a highly valuable and rewarding experience."
Voting is conducted online, on the Coop's website, and in order for the election to be considered valid, at least 1,100 student members of the Coop must vote. Online voting began on April 4 and will end on April 25. Results will be announced on May 2.

Prisoner number 61727-054, or to his nearest and dearest, Bernard "Bernie" L. Madoff, expressed in an interview to the Financial Times on Friday that several universities had asked him to develop an ethics course for their business school students.
Madoff, who is currently serving a 150-year prison sentence, has, perhaps ironically, set a high bar for himself as well—in the interview Bernie made it known that he's most interested in imparting wisdom to the students of Harvard Business School and Northwestern Kellogg School of Management.
Despite rumors, HBS students will not be advised on ethics by Madoff, regardless of his experience orchestrating the greatest Ponzi scheme in history—at least not in the foreseeable future.
"We have no knowledge of what he's talking about in terms of an ethics course so this is not something that's even on the table, and I have no idea where it came from," said James E. Aisner '68, director of media relations at HBS.

Akshay M. Sharma '14, a representative of the Resource Efficiency Program, unleashed the YouTube video "Turn off the Lights" yesterday in honor of Earth Day 2011.
The Resource Efficiency Program recruits undergraduate students to spread awareness about sustainability. From reducing food waste, shortening showers, and using reusable dishware, the program provides students with varying ways to decrease their carbon footprints and waste production.
Sharma produced and edited this video as an independent project. A green twist to Kanye West's "All of the Lights," Sharma sought to get students' attention through this popular song.
"I really just wanted to spread the idea and get people excited to learn about sustainability at Harvard," Sharma said.
The video, produced and edited by Sharma, also features his lyrical and vocal skills. Maura D. Church '14 assisted with vocals, and Miranda J. Morrison '14 helped write the lyrics.
"I believe Harvard makes an effort to go 'green' in every way that it can reasonably control," Sharma said. "I think it falls to the students to go further."
