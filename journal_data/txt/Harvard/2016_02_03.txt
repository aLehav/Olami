After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“You, Me and the Apocalypse,” a miniseries co-production from NBC and Britain’s Sky 1 network, debuted in the United Kingdom almost four months ago. Now it’s finally reached stateside—and thank goodness, because, well, it’s pretty darn good.
Here’s the gist: A massive, extinction event-sized meteorite is about to strike Earth, and whoever you are—“black or white, straight or gay, rich or poor”—the end is nigh. In a bunker deep underground, however, an unlikely collection of survivors finds themselves witnessing the demise of the human race on television. “You, Me and the Apocalypse” is the comedic chronicle of this ragtag band: who they are, how they came to be the last lifeline of humanity, and ostensibly how they might manage after the end of the world as we know it.
“Apocalypse’s” eclectic group of characters is portrayed brilliantly by one of the more impressive casts in broadcast comedy. British comic Mathew Baynton makes his U.S. television debut as Jamie, a young bank manager who is still haunted by the disappearance of his wife, much to the chagrin of his more fun-loving mates. Meanwhile, in Vatican City, Rob Lowe stars as Father Jude, an irreverent, chain-smoking priest whose job is to run background checks on potential saints—or in his own words, to find out if they “felt up kids and parked in handicap spaces.” The group is rounded out in a New Mexico maximum-security prison, where a meek-mannered librarian named Rhonda (Jenna Fischer of “The Office” is serving time for crimes she obviously did not commit—with the always brilliant Megan Mullally in her cell block as a white supremacist.
With such a geographically dispersed ensemble and just an hour of time, the pilot is understandably a bit disjointed, but there’s no reason to think that the plot won’t resolve itself once all of our characters are together in one place. In the meantime, “Apocalypse” makes do with what it has, employing well-structured vignettes rather than rambling exposition to dip into its characters’ quirky backstories. To its credit, the show also makes no attempt at being high-concept. Despite its sci-fi premise, “Apocalypse” is decidedly indifferent about crafting a complex mythology, instead relying on sharp performances, crisp dialogue and a clever sense of humor that, while dark at times, nonetheless manages to remain fresh and funny. The world may be ending, but humans—and not whatever is going to kill them—are the center of attention.
“You, Me and the Apocalypse” airs Thursday nights at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of last semester, Harvard’s House masters unanimously agreed to change their title after some students claimed it was too closely associated with slavery in the wake of similar concerns at other campuses. Two months later, however, the leaders of the College’s residential Houses have yet to meet to select a suitable replacement for the title.
We opposed the House masters’ decision to seek a new title in December, and continue to believe that the move was a mistake. No historical connection exists between the academic title master and slavery. Words can change in meaning over time, and seeking to rectify every case of sensitivity sets an implausible precedent. Moreover, without a final resolution, the decision has thus far served only to distract from more pressing problems. Rather than focusing on symbolism, the College should focus on tangible issues of inclusivity on campus.
Now, with the decision to change the title in the past, Harvard's House heads have the chance to address just those questions. To do so, however, they must rapidly move beyond such linguistic subtleties as the appropriateness of alternatives like "leader" and "rector."  Instead, the former masters should redirect their energy towards real conversations with their students about what a more inclusive and equitable Harvard experience will look like in practice. If all that comes of the current, closed discussions is a new, more awkward title, and no introspection or learning, then the present opportunity will have been wasted. House heads and students together must grapple with fundamental questions of inclusion in order to find solutions.
A particular area in which house-centered dialogue would prove fruitful is in a more open discussion of Harvard's often distressing history of exclusion. One unfortunate consequence of the ahistorical thinking that led to the title change has been a partial obscuring of the very real instances of racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression that checker Harvard's history. From 17th and 18th century Harvard affiliates who owned slaves and profited from their labor to President Lowell's institutional anti-semitism and homophobia in the early 20th century, our history bears the scars of broader social ills that persist to the present. Direct discussions between students and House masters would help the administration best address the echoes of that history as well as ensure that the Harvard community keeps these issues at the forefront of its thinking on inclusivity.
No matter how students, House heads, and other community members  ultimately choose to address the problems and promise of inclusivity, we must do so as a community. Changing the title may have been a mistake, but it need not consume more energy better spent on these much needed discussions. If the former House masters truly wish to reaffirm and expand their commitment to inclusivity, they should act on that desire by seizing this opportunity to provide a space for robust, student-centered discussions on the failings of Harvard's past and our collective hopes for its future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Harvard students seem to skip mornings entirely. For the few individuals up at the ungodly hour of 0800, breakfast provides a short respite from Harvard’s hectic atmosphere. At 0800, most people enjoying breakfast remain reserved, quietly assessing their plans for the day. However, I’m unusual in that I’m at my happiest during breakfast. Breakfast provides my daily serving of Cracklin’ Oat Bran, a delicious cereal responsible for healing my otherwise broken, weary soul. More importantly, breakfast grants me a much-needed rest between two different worlds: ROTC and Harvard.
When morning training comes to a close, I briefly feel free from ROTC. Sadly, three characteristics of ROTC keep me trapped in Cadet Land. The first involves the Army’s physical training uniform.
The bold “ARMY” insignia sprawled across the Army shirt and absurdly short shorts attract nothing but unwanted attention. It’s hard to escape Cadet Land when your clothes serve as a constant reminder that you’re Uncle Sam’s property. To make matters worse, last semester I was tasked with carrying our training group’s guidon, a glorified spear with a flag attached. When I’m carrying the guidon, people look at me like I’m a knight from Game of Thrones carrying his king’s war banner. Fortunately, most cut their gaze short, politely turning to avoid prolonged eye contact. I like those people; in turning away, they allow me to pretend I’m normal.
The next characteristic of ROTC constantly haunts cadets, even when we’re out of uniform. On top of endless emails from Harvard, cadets must also deal with ROTC emails. One can pretend not to have read student email with little consequence, but military emails demand an immediate response. Emails from cadre (the officers and NCO’s who oversee our training) often include the phrase “please acknowledge receipt of email.”
If you’re particularly unlucky, you’ll find an ROTC email asking for volunteers for some “optional” event. Harvard’s Army ROTC program consists of solely 6 cadets, which means every cadet needs to “volunteer” when an event comes along. That weekend you thought you were free to catch up on work? Joke’s on you; the Army just commandeered your Saturday morning. Should a cadet decide to ignore their email, they’ll soon receive a call from one of their higher-ups inquiring as to why they haven’t responded yet. Ignore the call, and you’ve just dug your own grave.
The last ROTC characteristic responsible for trapping cadets emerges from the term “cadet” itself. Due to our strange position between the Army and Harvard, we frequently find that no one understands our role.
On one hand, those in uniform often think of us as pampered students. Aside from the occasional weekend in the woods, we only train every other day. Meanwhile, active duty personnel find themselves immersed in a military environment 24/7. Our student counterparts, on the other hand, think we’re full-time soldiers. Our peers speak as if we’re to blame for the military’s past and current failures, forgetting that we’re at the bottom of the Army’s totem pole. If anything, we share your critiques of US military policy! After all, many of us joined ROTC to change military doctrine; we’re just in no position to enact change yet.
We’re constantly reminded that we’re outsiders to all. Our uniforms separate us, our email overwhelms us, and our lifestyle leaves us with few to turn to.
Like most old institutions, both the Army and Harvard have unique cultures. Both take pride in their independence, each operating in the manner they see fit. But more importantly, the two organizations draw their members from two different groups of people with distinct mindsets. Historically, Harvard was founded to serve America’s wealthy intellectual elite, whereas the Army prides itself on drawing heavily from America’s blue-collar families to answer their country’s call to service. Thus, neither institution fully comprehends the other, leaving cadets to navigate the unknown waters between the Army and Harvard alone.

UPDATED: February 4, 2016, at 12:24 p.m.
The whir of centrifuges may blend with the noise of chattering keyboards and buzzing work rooms when the Harvard Life Lab, a biotechnology research and entrepreneurial facility, is slated to open this fall in Allston.
Pending approval by the City of Boston, the proposed Life Lab will feature 36 lab benches, fume hoods, tissue culture and microscopy facilities, a private faculty-in-residence lab suite, conference rooms, and co-working spaces to support team planning. The two-story, 15,000-square-foot facility is slated for construction on Western Ave., in the parking lot directly west of the four-year old affiliated i-lab. 
Jodi Goldstein, the i-lab’s managing director, said the Life Lab will be an interim facility, expected to operate for the next five to 10 years before moving to a more permanent location.
“We look at this as a prototype of sorts, as a way to inform the future development of this Allston research and science community,” Goldstein said.
Goldstein said the lack of space and resources for life science ventures has been a conspicuous deficiency among Harvard affiliates interested in enterprise.
“It’s been a pain point of mine when we do have students in this area, we can’t offer them the wet lab resources to replicate and demonstrate their science, which slows them down,” she said.
Previously, life science startups based in the i-lab hired research organizations or academic labs to perform their research. Contracting out lab work is prohibitively expensive for companies in the early stages of development, according to Michael A. Schrader, a 2012 Harvard Business School graduate and the CEO of Vaxess Technologies, a startup founded at the i-lab. Vaxess uses silk proteins to develop vaccines that do not need to be refrigerated.
During its tenure in the i-lab, Vaxess often had to outsource lab-based research, Schrader said. He said outsourcing both cost the company money and lowered the quality of lab work.
“I can’t even imagine, had [Vaxess] been able to have that kind of infrastructure available two years earlier, I think we’d be at least a year to a year and a half farther ahead in the development of the technology,” he said.
If approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, Boston’s urban planning agency, the Life Lab will join the i-lab and the alumni-focused Harvard Innovation Launch Lab opened in 2014 as the third fixture of Harvard’s expanding entrepreneurial network in Allston. Harvard first presented plans for the Life Lab to the BRA at a public meeting in October.
“The way I think about it is the i-lab is the platform for all of this One Harvard, cross-disciplinary approach to occur,” Goldstein said, referencing Drew G. Faust’s “One Harvard” initiative.
The Life Lab will sponsor STEM workshops for local residents as part of the community benefits that now commonly accompany Harvard projects in Allston. Goldstein said the workshops are a result of input from the Harvard-Allston Task Force, a neighborhood advisory body to the BRA on the University’s Allston plans.
Schrader said he believes that the Life Lab could be “game-changing,” allowing life science ventures to perform their own lab work while remaining in close proximity to the i-lab’s network of startups.
“[The Life Lab] really gets me excited about the future for the Allston development,” Goldstein said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification: 
CLARIFICATION:  February 4, 2016
An earlier version of this article indicated a new biotechnology lab would open in Allston in September. To clarify, the lab is scheduled to open sometime in the fall.

As Harvard marches forward with Allston construction, some local residents say getting to Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings is becoming too much of a hike.
Paul “Chip” Alford, an Allston resident and frequent meeting attendee, argued that the recent trend of task force meetings scheduled in neighboring Brighton or on the Business School campus threatens to exclude the local residents from discussions.
“My neighbors can’t make it,” Alford said. “They’re old people, and they go up to the meetings...with their walkers and canes and stuff.”
The task force, a neighborhood advisory body founded in 2006 to deal with issues related to Harvard’s Allston projects, holds meetings roughly once every two months, though there is no set schedule. Meetings are intended to foster discussion of Harvard’s “ongoing planning and development in Allston” and the “public is encouraged to attend,” according to the Boston Redevelopment Authority’s website. The BRA is Boston’s urban planning agency.
Meetings used to frequently take place in the Honan-Allston Library, Alford said. The library sits on North Harvard Street in the heart of North Allston’s residential neighborhood.
Data provided by Gerald Autler, the BRA’s senior project manager, confirmed that between 2013 and 2015, the majority of task force meetings took place in various Business School buildings or at the Fiorentino Community Center located in Brighton about a mile away from the library.
Alford said he believes that it is more difficult for Allston’s elderly residents—who he said comprise the majority of the population affected by Harvard’s developments—to attend meetings held in locations other than the library.
“I might even go as far as asking Harvard University to provide shuttle service from the library to [the community center],” said John A. Bruno, the interim chair of the task force.
Both Autler and Bruno cited scheduling difficulties as the reason for the change in location.
“It wouldn’t really be feasible to restrict ourselves to one single venue,” Autler said. “It certainly would not be feasible to restrict ourselves to the library...because it would mean limiting our meeting nights to Mondays and Wednesdays when that room is not already booked.”
Bruno said the library closes at 8:00 p.m., forcing meetings to end prematurely at 7:45 even if the committee is in the middle of a “time-sensitive” discussion.
Bruno said some residents have suggested that Harvard consider paying to keep the library open later. Boston Public Library guidelines stipulate that library branches can remain open past normal operating hours for a fee paid in advance.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke declined to comment for the story.
“I understand that there are people who do want to attend, and if it’s inconvenient for them to attend [the community center] as opposed to the library, then yes that’s a concern I need to address,” Bruno said. “How do I address that? I’m not sure.”

The Cambridge City Council again did not vote on a resolution last Monday to rename Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples’ Day for the third time this year.
Despite what the resolution’s proponents claim is strong public support, the legislation is on hold while councillors negotiate how best to change the holiday name and still honor Italian Americans, many of whom see the day as a celebration of their heritage.
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, who is leading the charge for the name change, said he anticipates the process will continue to play out over the next few months while councillors try to be sensitive to Italian American residents' concerns.
The Council first heard the resolution last October, but pushed it back to late December, when the resolution was again tabled. Since then, Council members have not discussed the resolution in the three meetings since the start of the new year.
The resolution critiques the role of Christopher Columbus in American society and claims his actions should no longer be celebrated.
“The City of Cambridge recognizes that civilization as we know it would not be possible in the Americas without Columbus' voyages,” the resolution reads, “but must also hold to the moral imperative of condemnation of these actions, as we now know them to be violations of justice in the eyes of international, domestic, and moral laws.”
Councillor Jan Devereux, a supporter of the name change, said she hoped the group could reach some form of compromise to change the name and “acknowledge that many Italian Americans have made many contributions and should be recognized.”
A city council committee is currently investigating how to best honor Italian Americans’ contributions while also removing the name of a controversial historical figure, according to Devereux.
While the council continues to consider the resolution, many local residents have expressed their support for changing the name to Indigenous Peoples’ Day given the controversial history of Columbus. More than a dozen residents offered public comment at the December 21 council meeting, with the overwhelming majority saying they supported the resolution.
“I very much feel that the celebration of the first European to hit these shores is an absurdly racist way of putting the European above the rest in the world,” said Jeanne E. Koopman, a member of the Cambridge Residents Alliance who sent an email supporting the resolution to the council late last month.
While traditionally a day supporting Italian heritage, Mazen and Devereux noted that views on Columbus Day have changed among the populace.
“We’re also hearing from many Italian Americans who said, ‘I had no idea of Columbus’ bloody history,’” Mazen said.
Harvard saw its own share of efforts to change the holiday name this fall, when a number of students gathered outside Matthews Hall within Harvard Yard to celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day. About two years ago, similar demonstrations took place in Ticknor Lounge.
In Massachusetts, October was deemed Italian Heritage Month in 1999 under Governor Paul A. Cellucci. Columbus Day has frequently been the center of cultural celebration for Italian Americans in the Greater Boston Area, with parades honoring Italian heritage held throughout the region.
Devereux and Mazen said they expect discussions to continue into the future and remain steadfast in their support of the resolution.
“It is time to stop celebrating Columbus,” Devereux said. “I hope it comes off of unfinished business.”

Harvard Business School launched last week the Precision Trials Challenge, a contest that challenges participants to find a better way of conducting clinical trials during the drug approval process.
A $20 million gift from the Robert and Myra Kraft Family Foundation last November helps fund the contest, which will run through March. The gift, which came during the ongoing University wide capital campaign, was intended to support business oriented research around precision medicine.
The contest aims to gather ideas that make clinical trials cheaper and more efficient. Currently, the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process can take over ten years and cost from $1.5 billion to $5 billion, Sterling said. About half the cost of drug development comes from the trials, according to Sterling.
“I think the common wisdom is that we can [make clinical trials] more streamlined; we can do it quicker, better, cheaper,” Sterling said.
Precision medicine refers to developing treatments specific to a person’s individual genotype, according to Cara M. Sterling, director of the Health Care Initiative at the Business School.
“Robert Kraft, having some specific family history related to cancer, and his wife dying of cancer, said that we need to do more research around precision medicine,” Sterling said. “He gave his money to the Business School, interestingly, because he feels like a lot of the problems we have today are what we would call ‘business model problems.’”
Robert S. Huckman, the faculty co-chair of the Health Care Initiative, said he thinks the science of precision medicine has progressed faster than the business models for bringing that science to the market.
Huckman said that because precision medicine is a new field, innovators in the area have lacked a platform to bring their ideas forward. The contest welcomes people from around the world to submit their ideas through an online application, allowing for necessary interaction between researchers,according to Sterling.
“At the end of the day, organizations are going to have to work together to try to bring these therapies to patients faster—and that’s where I would have to imagine the Kraft family felt that a business school could be helpful to some already very inspiring science,” he said.
Matt Strickland, co-president of the HBS Health Care Club, praised the challenge and said that while the gift that funded it was “extremely generous,” advancing precision medicine is a formidable challenge.
“[The Precision Trials Challenge] is an interesting way to try to come up with something useful with a relatively small amount of money,” he said.

Conservative and Democratic Harvard affiliates had mixed feelings about Monday night’s Iowa caucuses and their role as the 2016 Presidential race unfurls.
As the results flooded in Monday night, Senator Ted Cruz emerged as a clear victor, while the Democratic race between former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton and United States Senator Bernie Sanders proved too close to call at the conclusion of the Institute of Politics debate watch party. Early Tuesday morning, the Iowa Democratic party called the “historically close” race for Clinton, who received 49.9 percent of the vote to Sanders’ 49.6 percent. 
The first contest of the primary season, the Iowa caucuses “give momentum to the candidates that either win or outperform expectations... and whittle down the field of Iowa candidates,” said Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, a lecturer of Government who teaches Government 1359: “The Road to the White House,” this semester’s second largest course.
Clinton supporters on campus said they were nervous about the closeness of the caucus results but were still optimistic about her future chances in the election process.
“It was definitely a nail-biter last night. I think it is still a very contentious race at this point but I do hope that Clinton pulls through in the end,” said Joseph L. Choe ’17, president of the Harvard Political Review.
Diaz said he considered the results in Iowa potentially “troubling” for Clinton supporters, and he suggested that the caucus served as a boost to Sanders’ campaign.
Harvey C. Mansfield Jr. ’53, a professor of Government and an outspoken Conservative, disagreed about the significance of the result for Sanders.
“Sanders almost got it, but he didn’t. A win’s a win for Hillary and I think that she is relieved and if not somewhat surprised at her success,” Mansfield said.
He Li ’16, president of Harvard United for Bernie, said he was pleased to see Sanders perform better than exit polls had suggested, and attributed this surge in popularity to more serious discussion about politics among voters and the work done by volunteers.
“I think that speaks to how powerful the ground game has been in Iowa over the past weekend and on Monday,” Li said. “Bernie has strong support among college students which may have motivated them to talk about Bernie to their families.”
On the Republican side, the results from Iowa are likely to whittle down the Republican field to a three person race, according to Diaz and Manfield. Unless another Republican gains momentum in New Hampshire, outsiders Cruz and Donald J. Trump—who have little support from Harvard Republicans—will likely face Senator Marco A. Rubio in a three way race, they said.
Rubio received 23 percent of the Republican vote, a much higher number than the 15 percent figure that Republican pollsters in Iowa predicted only a few days ago.
“Trump lost by coming in second, and Rubio won by coming in third,” said Mansfield, who added that he is “tending to support Rubio,” although he has yet to formally endorse.
Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, National co-chair of Students for Rubio, said “we were very pleased by the result [of Iowa].”
New Hampshire will hold primary elections next week. Still, professors warned against placing too much emphasis on both Iowa and New Hampshire’s results because the states’ relatively homogeneous populations do not accurately represent the national Democratic and Republican fields.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of a contentious year on college campuses across the nation, a  crowd of a hundred students gathered Tuesday evening to watch four of their peers debate the merits and pitfalls of political correctness and “PC culture.”
The debaters—Michael P. Richard ’17 and Simone E. A. Abegunrin ’18 for the affirmative, and Mack Andrews ’18 and Jordan A. Alston-Harmon ’17 for the opposition—sparred over recent issues ranging from student demonstrations against perceived racism at Yale and the University of Missouri at Columbia to controversy at Harvard over the use of House masters’ title and social justice placemats distributed by the Office of Student Life.
At the center of the debate was a concern for fostering free discourse. “The beauty of political correctness is that it provides the equity for marginalized groups to be able to advocate for themselves and challenge those who maybe have not realized what goes on in their lives and do not give them equity,” Richard argued.
The opposition, however, argued that political correctness does not establish a better environment for open conversation.
“There are some justified instances of PC culture, but as we’ve seen, there are also times when PC culture vastly oversteps its bounds,” Andrews said, holding up a copy of the controversial placemat that college administrators later apologized for. “What this placemat said is ‘Here’s what you’re supposed to believe, anyone who disagrees with you is wrong. This is the stance of Harvard, and you should take it like the word of God.’”
Both sides agreed with college administrators decision last semester to drop the title House Master, one some have associated with slavery. Since that time, College leaders have yet to reveal alternative nomenclature.
Many audience members took aim at the foundation of the debate: several specifically said they were frustrated by the lack of a consensus for the term “political correctness” itself.
“I feel like there was a bit of an unclear definition,” Akshat Agrawal ’18 said. “Both sides twisted the definition a little bit, had their own type of ideas. I feel like it would’ve been better if at the beginning they arrived upon an agreed upon definition of political correctness.”
The opposition seized on the ambiguity to argue for what they said was the exclusivity of political correctness. “I’m not an English major, but it has the word ‘correct’ in it, and to me that presupposes that there is some type of view that is correct, and there is some opposing view that is incorrect,” Andrews said.
In response, the affirmative offered an analogy to bolster their argument for the efficacy of political correctness. Political correctness, just as the term “personal computer,” have the same acronym, Abegunrin said. “A PC, like an actual computer … improves communication. It enhances sharing of knowledge. It makes everything easier, faster, and more effective—ideally.”
“But it’s not going to start out that way. The first computer was massive, was slow, didn’t have much data, it was actually harder to use a computer than to write a letter to someone. But upgrades were made. Different models were made. But in the end, PC is a pathway to more progress. It’s not an endpoint.”
The debate was the second installment of a two-part series called “The Politics of Race: Can We Talk?” hosted by the Harvard Political Union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences unanimously reaffirmed their commitment to a diverse student body at their monthly meeting Tuesday, voting to endorse a report supporting racial and ethnic pluralism at the College.
The report, developed by a small faculty committee in January 2015, reiterates Harvard’s “long-held and oft-expressed view that student body diversity—including racial diversity—is essential to our pedagogical objectives and institutional mission.”
The Faculty vote comes while Harvard faces a pending lawsuit alleging that the University uses an illegal quota to limit the number of Asian-American students admitted to the College. Filed by the anti-affirmative action group Project on Fair Representation, the lawsuit is currently on hold while the Supreme Court hears a similar case, Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin, for a second time.
“The diversity that we enjoy here at Harvard today is not simply something that we cultivate—we do—but something that has emerged with the new demographics of the United States,”  Comparative Religion professor Diana L. Eck said at the meeting, adding that Harvard has a “responsibility” to engage with diversity in and out of an academic context.
“I really feel that this is a very significant moment and one at which Harvard’s voice...is very important,” Eck said.
The issue of promoting diversity among undergraduates continued in the Faculty’s subsequent discussion of a proposal to create a joint music program between Harvard and the nearby Berklee College of Music. Modeled after the existing College and New England Conservatory dual degree program, the proposed Berklee collaboration would enable students to pursue a fifth year master’s degree in global jazz, film scoring, and music business, in addition to other offerings not emphasized in the Harvard-NEC program.
Several professors criticized the program for its potential to discriminate against economically disadvantaged students, citing possible thousands of additional dollars each student would pay to participate. Some faculty members said Harvard would likely not cover those costs.
Psychology professor Jason Mitchell, who sits on the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—cautioned faculty against turning art and music into disciplines exclusively available to the privileged and wealthy.
Supporters of the legislation from the Music department asked their colleagues to consider the program independently of expense. Faculty will likely vote on the proposal at their next meeting.
Continuing their prolonged discussion of the College’s General Education program, Faculty debated recommendations for a revamped system, on which they likely will vote later this semester.
History professor Andrew D. Gordon praised the proposal’s focus on enhancing the intellectual rigor of Gen Ed, but he expressed concerns about removing the current “Study of the Past” requirement. Additionally, Gordon said he worried that combining categories currently labeled as “United States in the World” and “Societies of the World” into a singular category as proposed would make the new program parochially focused on the United States.
The proposed legislation would require students to take four Gen Ed courses, to fulfill a distribution requirement, and to enroll in an additional quantitative-based course.
Virginie Greene, who chairs the Romance Languages and Literature department, suggested FAS consider a preregistration system once the new Gen Ed system rolls out so professors could predict enrollment and assign teaching fellows to courses accordingly. FAS currently does not have a preregistration tool; it eliminated pre-term planning last year.
Responding to Greene, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said he recognized the importance of more course enrollment estimations. He added that his office was studying various plans that would both preserve undergraduates’ choice in course selection and give faculty a precise estimate of course size.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 2, 2016, at 11:15 p.m.
BOSTON—It was a first period to forget for the Harvard women’s hockey team. Facing the potent offense of the top-ranked Boston College Eagles, it took just over four minutes for the Crimson to find itself down on the scoreboard. It was the beginning of a slippery slope for Harvard.
Just over a minute later, the BC lead had doubled, and three minutes later, the Crimson was down 3-0. When the horn went off to mark the end of the first frame, the No. 1/1 Eagles had already put two more past co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer to put Harvard in a 5-0 hole, paving the way for an 8-0 BC win in the Beanpot semifinals. For the Crimson, Tuesday marked the team's second loss to the Eagles this year after Harvard fell, 2-0, at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Jan. 19.
“We weren’t ready, and they were," co-captain Michelle Picard said. "And they took it to us."
Coming into the game as the reigning Beanpot champions, the Crimson (12-9-1, 9-6-1 ECAC) looked like anything but a contender as the team fell flat early on.
The high-flying BC attack got off to a quick start, as sophomore forward Tori Sullivan opened up the scoring for the Eagles (28-0-0, 19-0-0 Hockey East) with a shot from just outside the crease at 4:17. Senior blue-liner Kaliya Johnson extended the BC lead at the 5:40 mark, firing a shot from the point into the mesh for a 2-0 lead.
Things went from bad to worse for Maschmeyer and the Crimson as sophomore Toni Ann Miano scored the third goal for BC at the 8:09 mark with a rocket from the slot. Eight minutes later, defender Megan Keller joined the scoring party after Maschmeyer failed to corral the puck right outside the crease, allowing the sophomore to score. Captain Alex Carpenter scored the fifth and final goal of the period for the Eagles with just over a minute left.
The five goals allowed set a single-period season high for Harvard, who had previously allowed a high of three, and the tallies in the first frame alone tied the mark for the most goals the Crimson has allowed in a game all season. It was a particularly shaky frame on the stat sheet for Maschmeyer—who was pulled for junior netminder Brianna Laing at the start of the second frame—as the five goals tied a season-high in goals allowed for the Team Canada representative and put her below .500 on the season.
Though the Bruderheim, Alberta, native struggled, Harvard coach Katey Stone reaffirmed her confidence in the co-captain, whose defense was picked apart by the BC attack all night.
“[Maschmeyer] has been unbelievable for us all year,” Stone said. “There was no way I was going to pull her during the period because I don’t feel she deserved that by any means. A lot of those goals were not her fault…. It had nothing to do with Masch other than to make a very respectful decision in my opinion.”
The Harvard attack was practically nonexistent all night as the Crimson failed to seriously challenge BC goaltender Katie Burt. Harvard managed a mere 12 shots on goal, a season low, including only three shots in the second frame.
Constant pressure on the puck by the Eagles prevented the Crimson from establishing rhythm on the offensive end, as Harvard failed to control possession, was forced into turnovers, and was held within its own defensive zone for much of the game.
“They put so much pressure on us that we really didn’t have an opportunity for a lot of offense today,” Stone said. “Frankly, our coverage on the defensive end [had] consistent flaws…. Today right off the bat we made many mistakes.”
While Laing was able to withstand the barrage of shots BC sent her way early on, it did not take long for the Eagles to break through. Senior Lexi Bender found the back of the net from just outside the crease exactly five minutes into the period to give her side a 6-0 lead. Keller added her second tally of the match from just outside the left faceoff circle three minutes later, and Carpenter added the finishing touches in the final period, scoring her second of the game and 34th of the season to cap the 8-0 finish. Laing finished with 26 saves.
The eight goals marked the most allowed by the Crimson since BC scored 10 times against Harvard on Nov. 28, 2014.
On the other end, Burt picked up her tenth shutout of the season—and second over Harvard—as the Eagles earned further revenge over the Crimson after losing in the NCAA semifinals and Beanpot final last season to Harvard.
While the loss stings for the Crimson, the team will have to quickly move past it. With games coming up against Yale and Brown this weekend along with the Beanpot consolation game next Tuesday, Harvard will need to bounce back strong as the team continues its playoff hunt.
“We’ve got to learn from it,” Picard said. “We’ve got to see what we did wrong but also know that wasn’t us out there…. This is going to hurt for a while, but Friday we’ve got to get back at it, and that’s all you can do as an athlete. It stings and it hurts, but we’ve got a job to do on Friday night, and we’ll be ready to go”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—The Harvard women's ice hockey team entered Walter Brown Arena on the campus of Boston University Tuesday night looking to take the first step toward repeating as champion of the Beanpot.
Sixty minutes later, that opportunity had come and gone, leaving the Crimson (12-9-1, 9-6-1 ECAC) on the losing end of an 8-0 blowout at the hands of No. 1/1 Boston College (28-0-0, 19-0-0 Hockey East).
CAN’T STOP THE BLEEDING
The opening frame was the most one-sided period of hockey Harvard has played all season. BC pounced early, scoring within the first five minutes of play on a goal from sophomore forward Tori Sullivan.
From then on, the floodgates opened against the Crimson. The Eagles scored all eight of their goals in uncontested fashion, with Harvard unable to gain any type of momentum throughout the course of its time on the ice.
Goals found the back of the Crimson net in all sorts of ways—shots were lobbed past the shoulder of the goalie, they ricocheted off the post, and they squeezed underneath sticks.
“You’ve got to learn from it,” co-captain Michelle Picard said. “You have to see what you did wrong and hopefully make improvements. Coach [Katey Stone] always says to have competitive amnesia, so this is going to hurt for a little bit, but we have to get past it.”
CHANGING OF THE GUARD
In goal, Harvard started with veteran co-captain Emerance Maschmeyer, the team’s leader in minutes and saves. In the previous matchup between the Crimson and the Eagles, Maschmeyer was able to stop 36 of BC’s 38 shots against her.
Tuesday night’s performance in goal was hardly the same, as all five of the Eagles’ first-period goals were scored against Maschmeyer.
In an attempt to switch things up between the goalposts, Stone elected to send junior goalie Brianna Laing onto the ice at the beginning of the second period.
Coming into Tuesday night’s matchup, Laing had started three games for Harvard and come out of all three victorious, making her the only undefeated Crimson netminder before the loss to BC.
In the second period, Laing’s first on the ice, the Eagles still found the back of the net, but the junior netminder was able to keep the scoring to a minimum. Of the 19 shots BC put up against her in the second period, Laing stopped 17.
Remaining in goal for the third period, Laing was able to slow the Eagle offense, allowing just one goal to pass her in net.
THE SILENT TREATMENT
For the majority of the night, the Eagles rode their first line against the Crimson.
With the third-ranked defense in the country belonging to BC, Harvard was unable to muster much of an offensive effort to challenge it, leaving the ice unable to answer any of the Eagles’ eight goals over the course of the night.
Tuesday marked the fourth time this season that the Crimson has been shut out by its opponent, and the second time it has been shut out by BC, as the Eagles blanked Harvard at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Jan. 19.
The team was unable to string together much of an offensive effort for the entire length of the game, as the Eagles controlled the puck for the majority of the contest.
While three separate BC players tallied more than one goal against Harvard, there were no standouts among the Crimson offense. During its two power play opportunities, the team squandered both chances to score with a man-up advantage.
Eagle goalie Katie Burt continued her undefeated campaign in net, making 12 saves on the night. Burt has not been asked to make more than 15 saves in a game since her 29-save performance against Harvard in January.
“To play a good team like that with so much talent, it’s tough,” Stone said. “We tried to get the puck in deep, but that was difficult for us tonight. And the times that we were able to get down and were able to get a sustained drive, we [were] playing so much defense [that] we needed a line change.... We just need to play more offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventeen games into the season, there has yet to be a game where co-captain AnnMarie Healy has failed to score in double digits for the Harvard women’s basketball team.
Eclipsing her former career high of 24 against Yale last season, Healy dropped 27 points along with six rebounds against Columbia (11-8, 0-4 Ivy) on Saturday. Scoring 19 in the first half alone, Healy shot 13-of-14 despite facing added pressure from the Columbia defense and a double team in the second half.
She scored all of her 27 through the first three quarters, and in a game that would be decided by three points, Healy’s early scoring would prove to be pivotal.
“She’s been pretty constant for us as one of our statistical leaders,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a great athlete, so offensively she’s a tough matchup for a lot of people. She’s like the Energizer bunny, she just doesn’t wear down.”
With the departure of Temi Fagbenle last year, the Crimson (8-9, 3-1) lost one of its most prolific scorers in team history. Healy has undoubtedly done everything she can to fill the gap left behind.
As the Ivy League’s third leading scorer, averaging 15.6 points-per-game, Healy has become the Harvard’s go-to player at the forward spot. Despite Harvard’s overall mediocre field goal percentage, Healy also rounds out the Ivy League with the third-best field goal percentage at 50.9 percent.
Coming off an overtime win against Cornell (11-7, 3-1) on Friday where she scored 15 and added six rebounds, Healy’s effort on Saturday was huge. Despite being Harvard’s leading force scoring inside, Healy’s effort on the other end of the floor has also been key. With Tummala playing as more of a stretch four since the start of the season, Healy has stepped up in the paint on both offense and defense.
“She’s a finesse inside player,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s an athletic inside player, so she has to go against power a lot. She has to work a little bit harder because she can’t pound, she can’t move people. She has to get around them which takes that extra effort, and she’s constantly working at that.”
In charge of guarding freshman standout and rookie of the week Josie Little on Saturday against Columbia, Healy held Little to eight points and five rebounds.
“She’s an important piece of the defensive puzzle,” Delaney-Smith said. “We sometimes switch on screens, and so she’s [needed] to have some legs to cover guards driving. She’s just done a really good job for us.”
Beyond her dominance on the floor, Healy has stepped up as a leader on a young squad that features seven freshmen, two of which have been staples in the starting lineup. With the freshman working their way into the offense, Healy along with the Crimson’s other two seniors—Shilpa Tummala and Kit Metoyer—have become the key pieces to Harvard’s success.
"It’s happened several times in practice, when [the seniors are] leading statistically and by example,” junior guard Destiny Nunley said. “It’s so awesome playing with people who put their heart out on the court. They want you to be as successful as they are.”
Despite a difficult nonconference schedule that saw Harvard lose four games by less than five points, Healy has been one of the Crimson’s main sources of consistency.
With the Crimson’s next weekend slate featuring Ivy League heavyweights Penn and Princeton, Healy’s effort will be crucial at home against two of the Crimson’s biggest rivals. Playing against both of them on the road last year, Healy put up 18 against both in consecutive games.
“Her work ethic is phenomenal in the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s one of the things that’s so strong about AnnMarie—she just doesn’t get tired, she keeps going and going. Even though she’s been throughout the season a statistical leader, she’s still working at getting better.”

Ali MacGraw and Ryan O’Neal seem to be getting their own second chance—at love, and at working together on something that might not be the worst (or should we say best?) movie ever. The co-stars of Love Story are reuniting as the leads in a play called Love Letters whose Boston stop starts tonight.
Love means never having to say you’re sorry, although someone should probably be apologizing for the existence of that movie. Hopefully Love Letters will give Ali and Ryan a chance to show us that they can act convincingly as a couple in love. According to the Boston Theatre summary of the production, Love Letters is another story about star-crossed lovers who must struggle against some sort of something that keeps them from being together. The play chronicles their 50 years of friendship and thwarted love.
MacGraw and O’Neal even stopped by campus on Monday to promote the Boston stop of this production, presumably because Harvard students are known for being such enthusiastic and noncritical fans of Love Story, and were waiting with baited breath for another chance to see this dynamic duo in action. We can only assume that the Crimson Key Society greeted them by shouting about “phallic symbols,” calling MacGraw ugly, and dancing around in flashy seventies-era garb.
Love Letters is showing every night this week, with matinee shows on Saturday and Sunday. We suggest seeing it as a reminder that even if you’re going to be alone on Valentine’s Day this year, at least you won’t be this couple.

The Ivy League Campus Story is back, and to no one’s surprise, it is not lit. Unlike the snap stories of DJ Khaled, Groundhog Day, and the Iowa Caucuses, the Ivy League Story will not teach you the major keys to success, predict the future (weather), or remind you why 20% of millennials don’t vote. To preserve your sanity from one too many Columbia try-hards, we’ve recapped more than you’ll ever need to know about the Ivy League Campus Story.
Columbia is filled with try-hards
For reasons unknown the revived Ivy League Campus Story appears to be constantly dominated by Columbia students. Maybe it’s some kind of attempt at over-compensation driven by a deeply rooted inferiority complex. Either way, just talking at the camera isn’t going to cut it, Columbia. We expect a little more effort towards entertainment for our procrastination purposes.
Valentine's Day romance?
Apparently other Ivy League students are feeling the pressures of cuffing season a little more than the rest of us. So much so that a love triangle seems to have formed between a snapchat famous bachelor from Penn, a young lady from Dartmouth brave enough to ask him to be her Valentine for the world to see, and three more potential suitors from Harvard (so, technically a love pentagon). No, this is not the plot line to this year’s most anticipated romcom.
Columbia has sororities.
And if we wanted to hear screaming girls, we would’ve just watched The Bachelor.
“Suh dude” means “what’s up dude.”
Since “suh dude” isn’t self-explanatory by any means and does not sound/look anything like “sup dude,” we were so proud to see one of the only four Harvardians in tonight’s story give us the definition of this ever-so confusing slang. At least we know that we can always rely on those who make it on to the Campus Story to uphold the fine reputation of Harvard.
Apparently #IvyLeagueIntroductionChallenge is now a thing
No, not the standard “Harvard Introduction” you used all of Freshman Week of name, dorm, and concentration. The one thing that almost all of the most recent snaps that had the true honor of making it onto Ivy League Story had in common was that they had students across the Ivies rapping introductions of themselves with #IvyLeagueIntroductionChallenge. Take note of this if you’re looking for a surefire way to achieve snapfame.
Though we’ll always probably mourn the loss of our very own Harvard Campus Story, sharing the spotlight seems to be better than no Campus Story at all.

As college students, we see a wide range of fashion styles on campus. There’s that kid that you think should probably start a fashion line (and since it’s Harvard, he or she probably already has). And then there’s that other one you’re not entirely certain owns pants that aren’t flannel.
But all of us, from the Paris-bound fashionistas to the ones who clearly just rolled out of bed, have been thrown into utter confusion. ‘Why?’ you may ask. Three words: This. Freaking. Weather. Although it’s only February, here in Cambridge we are experiencing spring-like weather almost every day. That’s enough to cause chaos in anyone’s closet. If you too are struck by the impossible dilemma of figuring out how to dress yourself every morning, we’ve compiled some tips.
Make scarves a regular part of your wardrobeScarves are your best friends in these strange times. First and foremost, scarves are a trendy fashion statements. You can pair a patterned scarf with pretty much any plain shirt or sweater. Scarves are also very versatile, a necessity in such temperamental weather. You can tie them loosely around your neck when it’s warm, or bundle them up once the sun sets and it gets chilly. In desperate times, a scarf can double as a shawl or a blanket. And for the truly lazy, why not just bring your blanket with you as a makeshift scarf?
Don’t leave the house without at least a light jacket“Yeah, thanks a lot, mom,” you’re probably thinking. But we’re serious! Despite how optimistic you may be feeling, this weather changes as often and as frequently as your schedule now that sectioning assignments are coming out. You shouldn’t be the sad person caught outside in a strong wind without a jacket. Look through your closet, and find a warm sweatshirt or light jacket that you really like to throw on over your clothes every day. Pro tip: Some winter jackets come with an inner liner jacket. Check to see if yours does, and you can use that for a while.
Glue a hat to your head (not actually)Hats are truly all that is right in this world. Whether you’re into beanies, ski hats, or bomber hats, find something that covers your ears. Hats, much like scarves, can be a great way to add some contrasting color to your wardrobe. They’re also great for this time because it’s still technically winter, and therefore totally acceptable to be wearing a hat. Maybe even earmuffs, if you’re bold...actually, maybe not. Keeping your head and ears warm is a good way to feel a little warmer regardless of what you’re wearing for the rest of your outfit. So find yourself some suitable headgear and never let it go.
