After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 3 at 02:06 a.m.
My skin is itchy—Sandra Y.L. Korn ’14 in her February 1 article “What Anti-Semitism?” set me up as a straw man. I now have to deny her accusation that I was making an accusation I never made, while noting that had I made that accusation with just a little more subtlety­—she herself admits it would be justified.
Korn attacked an article I wrote about my talk about Identity Zionism at Harvard last semester, so there is no ambiguity, the written record is clear. I described the warm, intelligent reception I received at Harvard, noting that “on too many campuses” – and I italicized “too many,” emphasizing some but not all—pro-Israel or Zionist speakers have been “harassed.”
Caricaturing my argument, she wrongly suggests I contrasted Harvard with everywhere else. She ignores the article’s intention of encouraging civil discussion about Zionism. And she pole vaults past my words claiming, Troy “relies on the assumption (which he has put forth in other articles) that ‘pro-Palestinian’ means ‘anti-Semitic.’” In the article in question, I never used the term “anti-Semitic”—I mentioned “anti-Zionist forces.” Moreover, I have acknowledged repeatedly in my writing that many people are pro-Palestinian or critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Korn distorts my “assumptions” and my “writing”—with no evidence.
What I have said, repeatedly, although not in that article or that talk, is that Israel’s critics, including Palestinians and their allies, have a moral obligation to distance themselves from those pro-Palestinian activists who are anti-Semitic. I have challenged them to condemn the anti-Jewish stereotypes in the Arab press resurrecting Hitlerian caricatures when attacking Israel, and to repudiate those extremists who engage in Jew-hatred when championing Palestinians.
Of course, not everyone who is pro-Palestinian is anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. But many pro-Israel speakers have been disrupted on campuses, including Michael Oren, Israel’s Ambassador to the US, and there have been documented incidents of anti-Israel protestors waving placards denouncing Jews, wishing Hitler had “finished the job” or  throwing pennies at Zionists. Even Korn admits that, “some advocates for Palestinian rights are undoubtedly anti-Semitic.”
Finally, again without documentation, she says she is “assured by others” that “across the globe” the “arguments for economic sanctions on Israel do not stem from deep-seated anti-Semitism.” Here, she at least pretends to adduce proof by inserting a hyperlink. But her “evidence” is an article about the problem of falsely making accusations of anti-Semitism. The article says nothing about the worldwide anti-Israel boycott movement – which has some activists who are anti-Semitic, who deserve condemnation.
How odd. Korn feels compelled to allege falsely that I invoked anti-Semitism to then minimize claims of anti-Semitism by others even though she acknowledges that some pro-Palestinian voices are anti-Semitic. This exhausting tryout for the apologetics Olympics, cut off from the truth, minimizing the serious problem of anti-Semitism which does exist, suggests a moral blindness and animus that are unworthy of the Crimson and of Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I wanted to get out of class on any given day without hurting my grade, I might tell my professor that my grandmother is very ill, or maybe that a pet had died. Regardless of the strength of my desire to miss a particular class, I would never tell this professor that a close relative had been brutally murdered over the weekend—or that I had been raped. Few people would. So why do most of my peers and elders believe that a false rape accusation is the easiest way for a young woman to torpedo the aspirations of a successful young man?
About once every three months, another prominent rape case splashes across the printed and digital pages of the most influential media outlets. Invariably, at least half of the opinion pieces on the incident will cast doubt on the veracity of the victim’s account. They will probably mention the 2006 Duke lacrosse scandal, a much-talked-of investigation in which a stripper’s accusation of rape was proven false only after it had already ruined the lives of the three charged male lacrosse players.
The case will also become a topic of conversation among my peers as well as among my parents and their friends. The majority of my male friends and relatives—mostly liberal and conventionally upstanding—will raise the possibility of a false accusation. As will most females.
And every three months, I will exhaust myself in the attempt to push back against this overwhelming and unwavering belief in the preponderance of false accusations.
In this first quarter of 2012, the cycle has already begun. The focus of allegations of assault presently serving as an object of close scrutiny and idle speculation is that of Patrick Witt, the Yale quarterback who was lionized for his decision to forfeit a Rhodes scholarship in order to play in the Harvard-Yale football game. Late last week, another, less heroic side of Witt surfaced in the media: in September, a female student had apparently lodged an informal complaint against Witt through Yale’s University-wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct. As it turns out, the Rhodes Committee had supposedly suspended his candidacy upon hearing of the accusation.
Since the victim understandably wishes to remain anonymous, the details of the alleged assault remain unknown. Because of this dearth of information, I will be the first to admit that no one is currently in any position to accuse Witt of rape. But why does this same dearth of information serve as grounds for most of my friends and acquaintances to accuse the young woman of fabricating the assault?
As a senior member of Response Peer Counseling, I have spent fifty-seven hours of the past three academic years in training about issues of sexual assault, abuse, dating, and other relationship issues. In my capacity as both a counselor and as a friend to my peers, I have heard countless stories of rape, almost-rape, and otherwise unlabeled situations of varying levels of violation and discomfort. I have even found myself questioning my own past experiences, unwilling and unable to categorize them.
Sexual assault is undoubtedly swampy terrain: with each step onto its viscous surface, you move farther from the certainty of solid land. Eventually, you can no longer find your way back. The more I learn and the more stories I hear, the more I am convinced that no umbrella definition of sexual assault can exist. Just as each person defines his or her sexuality for him or herself, each person defines sexual assault on a similarly personal level. I do not wish to encourage denial or repression but rather to acknowledge everyone’s right to comprehend a strange or difficult experience in the way that makes most sense for them. My experience has, however, provided me with one certainty: it is much more likely that a woman will undergo a traumatic experience, acknowledge it as such, and decline to report it for fear of ruining the life of a handsome, young Harvard man.
Therefore, we should not be asking the impossible question of “Did Witt assault this woman?” Instead, we should ask what kind of society we have constructed if false rape accusations are considered a likely and easy mode of retaliation. To me, this pervasive fear points to a world in which men are aware of an unearned cultural dominance. Since they know their authority has not been obtained but inherited, they fear losing it to a resentful woman, whose only tool in their eyes—one to be used for good or for evil—remains her sexuality.
Let us return for a moment to the classroom analogy. Imagine that I am absolutely desperate to miss a midterm. I consider any number of plausible excuses. Let’s say, I somehow alight upon, and then choose, a pretext as awful as murder of a relative. Not only would such a story emotionally disturb me, its teller, it might also merit a personal follow-up from the professor. Curiosity might even drive this professor to Google. Finding nothing like what I described, she or he would quickly become suspicious and start to question my story, which would then deflate as quickly as a punctured balloon beneath the pinprick of interrogation. I think I’d rather just take the midterm.

Here’s a story you might have heard about the MBTA: it’s billions of dollars in debt. Boston has the lowest transit fares of any major city in the country, but the system is facing a $161 million budget deficit for fiscal year 2013, and it’s time for the riders to pay their fair share. To that end, the T released a proposal in early January containing two possible scenarios for fare increases and service cuts, to take effect in July of this year.
Here’s another story. The T is a lifeline for millions of people in the 175 cities it serves. Those most dependent on it are students, senior citizens, disabled people, and lower-income workers. Even those who don’t ride it reap the benefits, as public transportation keeps cars off the road, lowers pollution, and attracts tourists and shoppers who contribute to the city’s economy. The T employs over 6,000 unionized workers and enables thousands more to reach their jobs. The Ride transports elderly and disabled people to doctors’ appointments and allows them to live full lives rather than being confined to their homes. Harvard students use the T to get to extracurricular activities, job interviews, and the cultural events that make Boston an attractive place to go to school.
In 2000, the state of Massachusetts forced the T to start paying for all of its expenses out of a limited amount of money received at the start of the fiscal year, instead of funding it fully as it had in the past. The T is a public good, not a for-profit operation. In addition to the funds it receives from local and state governments, its main sources of revenue are fares and a portion of the state sales tax. But given the state of the economy, revenue from the sales tax has been far less than was predicted in 2000. One of the most glaring injustices in the current funding structure is that the T is responsible for paying off the debt incurred by the Big Dig, a highway project that did not benefit transit riders. In an attempt to gain much-needed revenue, the T has invested in costly interest rate swaps with some of the banks responsible for the economic crisis, including J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank. The end result is the T’s current fiscal disaster, which led to January’s proposals for cuts.
In the first proposed scenario, bus and subway fares would increase 43 percent. In the second scenario, the increases would be slightly lower, but there would be more cuts, including 58 percent of bus routes. Both scenarios would eliminate ferry service, commuter rail service after 10 p.m. and on weekends, and weekend service on the Mattapan Trolley and the Green Line’s E branch. The cost of student and senior passes would double. The T is holding hearings where riders can express their opinions about the proposals, but these are effectively just for show, since Transportation Secretary Richard Davey has said the changes are “impossible to avoid” and the T is not actively investigating alternatives.
The proposals would only plug this year’s deficit, meaning that riders could face another round of cuts next year, though it’s hard to imagine what will be left to cut by then. In the meantime, hundreds of people will lose their jobs. Thousands more will lose the ability to get around. The cuts, which target vulnerable populations such as youth, senior citizens, and bus riders (in many cases people of color), are short-sighted and discriminatory.
It’s up to the state government to make sure that public transportation is properly funded. State officials have repeated publicly that the T doesn’t have the money to avoid these measures. But much like at Harvard, the money is there; it’s just in the wrong pot. Not a penny of our fares goes toward the transportation itself; it all goes toward paying off the T’s debt, much of which was unfairly inherited in 2000. A first step would be to relieve the T of some of its debt burden and the loans held by big banks.
A second step would be to raise the gas tax, a solution which Governor Patrick once favored but has recently stepped away from. While T fares have gone up four times since 1991, the gas tax has not increased at all in that time. There are currently several bills in the state legislature that would raise the gas tax and index it to inflation. Many other alternatives exist, including in-house operation of the commuter rail, transit passes paid for by big non-profits, and increased flexibility between capital and operating funds.
One of Boston’s most famous songs tells the story of Charlie, an unfortunate rider who got stuck on the T because of a fare increase. The song ends, “Oh, you citizens of Boston, don’t you think it’s a scandal that the people have to pay and pay?” Plenty of Bostonians do think so and are mobilizing against this attack on public transportation, including groups like the T Riders Union, the Amalgamated Transit Union, and Occupy Boston. If you don’t think that the T should force riders to bear the burden of an unsustainable budget fix, join the fight. Attend the public hearing in Cambridge on February 29. Sign this petition, then call your legislators and tell them to take a public stand against the cuts. Many of us ride the T, and all of us need it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fortunately, it’s rare to find a politician willing to discourage American students from pursuing higher education.  Yet, in this Republican primary season, we’ve found one such candidate in former Senator Rick Santorum.  Last week he speculated that Obama only wants more students to attend college because the universities’ “indoctrination…is one of the keys to the left holding and maintaining power in America.” Santorum’s accusation betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the American university.  Campus discourse is about a free exchange of ideas, not indoctrination.  Despite what Santorum may believe, colleges like Harvard are home to an impossibly broad array of political and cultural affiliations, which mix, mingle, and collide to give the campus its vibrancy.
There has never before been a time when so many different perspectives, identities, and political leanings have been present on the Harvard campus. We are home to Bible studies, queer organizations, religious associations, and labor-rights groups.  Even the faculty is more intellectually diverse than every. Our largest course, Ec 10, is headed by arguably the nation’s most prominent right-wing economist, Gregory Mankiw. The University is also home to left-wing luminaries like Roberto Unger. Perhaps the real issue at hand is that Santorum seems to consider the free flow of ideas to be malignant to society.  A university that fit his bill would likely be more prone to indoctrination than any current American university.  Harvard maintains a high standard of freedom, allowing a veritable intellectual Noah’s Ark to flourish on campus.
The fact of the matter is that things Santorum considers to be the trappings of leftism, like available birth control and respect for queer individuals, are in fact just the basic requirements of a decent, modern community.  Today, a majority of Americans support gay marriage, and unrestricted access to contraception has been the law of the land since, well, 1965. It is Santorum’s views that live on the fringe of the American ideological landscape. Our universities, while perhaps a couple notches to the left of the general population, are its intellectual bazaar. They are a cross section of our national community and are vital to our culture.
Yet, there is another troubling implication of Santorum’s statement. Considering that blue-collar jobs are disappearing from America’s shores, we must come to terms with the economic imperative of a highly educated workforce. Santorum, in discouraging students from pursuing higher education, has shown his willingness to sacrifice our economic welfare at the altar of right-wing extremism. President Obama is right: We need more, not fewer, students in higher education.
As evidence for his statement, Santorum mentioned a vague statistic that “62 percent of children who enter college with a faith conviction leave without it." Even if we are to take Santorum’s statistic at face value, it is hardly instructive. Correlation is most certainly not causation, and to presume that universities are faith-killers ignores the high possibility that other factors motivate the change. Perhaps the students who choose to leave home for college are generally less deeply religious than their peers. Or maybe 18-23 year-olds, regardless of higher education, become less religious than those below them in age.
Colleges aren’t places of “liberal indoctrination”, they are a great resource of intellectual freedom that play a key role in keeping the United States economically viable. In the future, hopefully Santorum will consider these sorts of things more heavily before making policy prescriptions.

Inter-bank and bank-state coordination are major predictors of the success of a bailout, a Harvard researcher studying bailout strategies in Europe and the U.S. claimed at a Center for European Studies seminar on Wednesday.
"We've had a wonderful social science moment in which the same thing happens across several countries at once," CES visiting scholar Cornelia Woll said about the global economic crisis that has unfolded since 2008.
Woll, who works at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne and the Paris Institute of Political Studies, said her research indicates that greater coordination between banks correlates with better outcomes from bailouts in the U.S. and Europe.
This effect, she said, is likely because coordination allows banks to share risk and lets banks “speak as one” in dialogues with government representatives.
"The ways in which the banking sector can speak to the government can crucially shape how a bailout is eventually defined," Woll said. "A close, one-to-one relationship between individual banks and the government leads to unbalanced bailouts."
Woll emphasized that, unlike historical data sets that remain static, her data can change from day to day. For example, she noted that she once studied "a German bailout that, from one day to the next, changed by 50 billion euros because of an accounting error."
She also discussed the spontaneous nature of the recent bailouts. The Irish bank bailout, Woll said, ultimately cost Ireland more than 225 percent of the nation’s GDP and was formulated overnight by a small group of government officials.
"It was a complete suicide mission," Woll said. Daniel K. Mügge, a CES visiting scholar who attended the talk, said that the speech reinforced "the enormous difficulty and uncertainty that the actors face when coming up with these [bailouts]."
Mügge asked, "If we as academics have trouble making sense with years of hindsight, how do you make decisions in the moment?"
Brigid Laffan, a CES visiting scholar from Ireland who also attended the seminar, said she felt that studying the bailouts was important but expressed skepticism that there could be conclusive explanations.
"Sure, [the theory] has some explanatory weight," Laffan said, "but the structure of banking systems varies a lot."

Harvard Law School professor emeritus Charles M. Haar, known for his ability to identify innovative solutions to issues of land use and environmental policy, died of congestive heart failure last month in Miami. He was 91.
In the classroom, Haar taught on legal matters related to urban planning, environmental law, corporate finance, housing law, and other fields. He put that expertise to work as an adviser to three presidents and a multitude of projects worldwide.
“He was a real polymath,” said University of Florida law professor Michael A. Wolf, who worked as a research assistant to Haar as a graduate student and continued to collaborate with him for thirty years.
Colleagues said that Haar’s career had a lasting impact on others in the field he helped pioneer.
“He had a long, productive life,” said Thompson Potter, who worked as Haar’s assistant at the Law School for 15 years. “He was a very self-made person. He created a field of law and had a big impact on what people feel about city planning.”
Before receiving his degree from the Law School in 1948, Haar served under General Douglas MacArthur’s command in Naval intelligence.
He began teaching at the Law School in 1952 and was appointed as professor emeritus in 1991.
In the 1960s, Haar began working in government, serving as an adviser on urban development and the environment in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter administrations.
He chaired Johnson’s National Task Force on the Preservation of Natural Beauty and later helped organize the first White House conference on the environment in 1965.
Haar wrote several books, including one about housing law entitled “Suburbs under Siege” and one called “Mastering Boston Harbor: Courts, Dolphins, and Imperiled Waters,” which was published in 2005. Both of those works are now featured in a display case dedicated to Haar by the circulation desk at the Law School library.
“Mastering Boston Harbor” discussed Haar’s involvement as a court-appointed special master on a case filed by the city of Quincy against the Boston sewer system. As a result of the trial, the state passed the Massachusetts Water Resources Act and launched a clean-up of Boston Harbor.
Haar’s role “required a combination of knowledge of the law, some passion, some political ingenuity, and pragmatism,” said Steven G. Horowitz, who worked with Haar on the case and was his student at the Law School.
Wolf noted that Haar could analyze complicated situations quickly to generate possible solutions.
“He could cut to the kernel of an issue immediately,” Wolf said. “He didn’t think and ponder as we normal mortals do. His ideas came out of his head fully formed. It was an amazing thing to watch.”
Haar also served as a fellow for the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge for half a century.
His passion for art—he was a “connoisseur of drawings,” according to Potter—led him to advise the Fogg Museum’s Department of Drawings and even donate pieces.
Horowitz remembered that Haar was constantly involved a variety of projects, in Cambridge and worldwide. For example, he helped Providence revitalize its downtown area and lent advice on land use problems in Jerusalem.
“There was a strong interest in many law professors on providing their expertise beyond the classroom,”  Horowitz said. “He was one of those who really believed in that, in real world pursuits.”
Horowitz, like Wolf, marveled at Haar’s creative problem-solving abilities.
“You never knew what he was going to come up with,” Horowitz said.

For Hannah A. Nunez ’15, shopping week did not end on Friday.
“Shopping week is short. You’re just getting into the stuff in the second lecture,” Nunez said. When she found herself torn between two courses at the end of the week, she chose to sign up for both.
“I just really wanted to get more into the lectures to see what the material really was—I decided to add them both and drop one later,” she said.
Nunez was one of many students who took advantage of the period in which students can add and drop courses without penalty to extend shopping week past its official bounds. Last year, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar Michael P. Burke told The Crimson that almost 2,100 courses were added and dropped by the no-fee deadline.
“I wanted this semester to kind of expand my horizons and try out different concentrations,” Nunez said. “I really wanted to just try a bunch of different classes.”
This week, Nunez ultimately decided to drop Sociology 25: “Sociology of Organizations.”
“I liked the first two lectures, but this past week I really found that I don’t like the readings and I don’t like the topic,” she said.
Other students used the add/drop period to make their way into classes that held late lotteries.
Tony Ho ’14, who dropped Computer Science 248: “Advanced Design of VLSI Circuits and Systems,” said that he left the class because he successfully lotteried into Societies of the World 24: “Global Health Challenges: Complexities of Evidence-Based Policy.”
“I switched because I needed a Gen Ed, and once I got into Societies of the World [24], I just felt better doing that,” he said.
Ho added that he thought dropping the computer science course would also make his semester less challenging.
“I think, overall, it’s probably going to be a lighter work load,” he said.
Samuel F. Himel ’12, the chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, said that he did not find it surprising that many students continue to change their schedules after they first turn in their study cards. He added that the Council has considered advocating an extension of the addw/drop period beyond the fifth Monday of the term, when students currently can modify their schedules for a ten dollar fee.
“It’s not clear to me that a lot of courses even have assessments before the fifth Monday,” said Himel, a former beneficiary of the add/drop period himself.
“A lot of peer institutions have much later drop deadlines,” he said.

After an hour of heated debate, the Graduate Student Council passed a resolution Wednesday night decrying the violence used against students involved in Occupy protests at the University of California campuses at Davis and Berkeley.
“It was something that was so universal, that students shouldn’t be beaten and pepper-sprayed on their campuses,”  said Summer A. Shafer, a graduate student in the history of American civilization who sponsored the bill. “This resolution seeks to protect all students on Harvard’s campus from violent repercussion.”
The act, passed by a majority of 29 to 9, resolved two months of discussion on whether the GSC’s constitution allowed the council to vote on such a measure.
“There was a lot of debate as to what the role of the GSC is for graduate students,” said GSC President Cammi N. Valdez, a graduate student in biological and biomedical sciences. “When you have a resolution that acts as a blanket statement for all graduate students, there inherently will be debate.”
Before a vote on the main proposal was held, GSC Representative Laura A. McDaniel, a doctoral candidate in health care policy, sponsored a vote on the constitutionality of such a bill.
Some saw the prolonged debate on the issue’s constitutionality as reflective of flaws in the GSC’s structure.
“It shows the breakdown of that democratic process in the GSC and illuminates the need for serious transformation of those practices here on Harvard’s campus for graduates students,” said  Hannah L. Hofheinz, a teaching fellow at the Derek Bok Center.
Several representatives said they felt nervous about casting a vote on the contentious issue.
“Some representatives didn’t feel comfortable voting on the resolution,” McDaniel said. “We weren’t sure how to vote to represent our departments.”
The hot-button issue drew larger crowds than the GSC customarily attracts, representatives said. More than 70 individuals packed the Dudley House lounge to participate in the debate.
Council adviser Cherie L. Ramirez, a graduate student in biological and biomedical sciences who serves as a teaching fellow for the General Education program, saw the discussion as a positive learning experience for representatives.
“The last two meetings have been the most lively in five years,” Ramirez said. “It was interesting seeing that some representatives were uncomfortable with the idea of reaching out and representing their departments, because that is what they are supposed to do.”
Many representatives saw the experience as an opportunity to speak to other students in their departments in order to ensure that their votes reflected their department’s consensus.
“Clearly, students were behind the resolution, and the results reflect that,”  said Rudi Batzell, a doctoral candidate in history. “But the process was a fiasco, and it was ridiculous.”

Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations spent $510,000 on lobbying Congress in 2011, according to public records filed with the House of Representatives and the Senate.
According to the forms, Harvard had an interest this year in legislation including the DREAM Act, Stop Online Piracy Act, and the PROTECT IP Act; the federal budget; and bills related to college tuition and university endowments. To help the University in its lobbying efforts, Harvard employed Washington law firm O’Neill, Athy & Casey at a cost of $120,000.
During the fourth quarter of 2011, Harvard reported spending $120,000. In that time, the University listed the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act among the bills on its radar screen.
Opponents of SOPA and PIPA argued last month that the bills represented an attack on personal freedoms and innovation, while supporters saw them as crucial to combatting online pirating. The bills were put on hold after considerable opposition from popular websites such as Google and Wikipedia and from the public.
Though the University has not expressed a stance on those bills to members of Congress, Harvard lobbyists are keeping an eye on the legislation, according to a statement from Kevin Casey, Harvard’s senior director of federal and state relations.
“We generally list bills if we are monitoring [them] and our community is engaged,” Casey wrote about SOPA and PIPA. “So while no one on our Federal Relations team was in touch with any members to express a position on the bills, they did gather information and are continuing to monitor the bills.”
The University continues to lobby members of Congress in support of the DREAM Act, which University President Drew G. Faust has publicly endorsed since 2009.
If passed, the bill would grant conditional permanent residency to undocumented students who immigrated to the United States before the age of 16, under the condition that they graduate from high school and complete either two years of higher education or two years of military service.
Harvard’s expenditure on lobbying was second-highest among Ivy League universities. At $610,000, Yale spent the most in 2011.
Over the past decade, Harvard has spent millions on lobbying, with per annum expenditures fluctuating between $440,000 and $1.17 million.
Harvard’s lobbying budget reached its peak in 2007, when the Higher Education Act—originally passed in 1965—was considered for reauthorization.
The bill, which dealt with funding for higher education, passed both the House and the Senate by early 2008.
Harvard is required to file its next lobbying report for the first quarter of 2012 by April 20.

Based on public records, an earlier version of this article reported that Harvard paid $120,000 to the law firm O'Neill, Athy & Casey in 2011 in addition to the $510,000 that the University spent on lobbying. In fact, according to University spokesperson John D. Longbrake, the fees paid to the law firm were included in the 2011 total expenditure on lobbying.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last week, several dozen Harvard men found invitations to a Sigma Alpha Epsilon invitation-only event slipped under their doors—a custom typically associated with the final club punch process, not fraternity rush.
When the selected male undergraduates opened the envelopes, they learned that they had been asked to attend an event hosted by the Harvard fraternity on Wednesday, one night before the group kicks off rush on Thursday.
“We were people that someone in SAE already knew personally,” said Keenan Monks ’15, who attended the event after receiving his invitation on Monday.
Monks said the event was casual, adding that “it was about meeting the guys. All the brothers were there, talking, getting to know each other.”
Though SAE held the exclusive reception before rush kicks off, all male undergraduates are welcome to attend the initial rounds of its rush process. The fraternity’s website states that “the first and second events [of rush] are open to all.”
SAE has mounted an extensive recruiting campaign for its open events, hanging posters in freshman dorms and upperclass Houses. A number of freshmen also said they received a small yellow flyer slipped under their door advertising the organization’s first open rush event.
SAE president Samuel W. Peterson ’13 could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening. Several SAE members—including rush director Gabriel Trevino ’14 and former president Phillip Morris ’12—declined to comment.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon is the only one of Harvard’s three fraternities that held an invitation-only event this semester before the start of its formal rush process. The presidents of Alpha Epsilon Pi and Sigma Chi both said their fraternities have not held such events.
All three fraternities, which run separate rush processes, will hold their first-round events on Thursday.
AEPi President Elliot J. Stein ’13 said that the initial rounds of his fraternity’s rush are open to all.
“If you see a flyer about our rush event, you can bring your roommates and friends,” Stein said.
During its two-week rush, AEPi hosts approximately seven non-committal events that are designed to help prospective members determine if the organization is a good fit for them.
As rush progresses, AEPi winnows the pool of potential new members by holding invitation-only events for those “who will probably continue on and join the fraternity,” Stein said.
Maxwell D. A. Dikkers ’13, consul of Sigma Chi, said that his organization has an open rush process that allows all male freshmen, sophomores, and juniors to attend the first events.
“It’s an opportunity for rushes to get to know the brothers and learn more about the organization,” Dikkers said. “We have an open rush until the end when, like any other organization, we ask those whom we got to know the best through the rush process to join Sigma Chi.”
Jack C. Smith ’15, a member of Sigma Chi who rushed in the fall, said his organization holds open rush events in the first rounds of the process to foster an inclusive social environment.
“We definitely value the open character of rush, and we don’t want to come off like a lot of final clubs,” Smith said.
“I know Sigma Chi has been really hesitant to do invite events. We don’t want to establish that kind of character for ourselves.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a New York Times editorial declared in November that “American legal education is in crisis,” law professors from Harvard, Indiana University, and York University refuted the editorial’s dismal claim at a panel discussion on Thursday.
Though they disagreed with claims of a “crisis,” the panelists said that law schools do face numerous challenges, such as rising tuition costs, a shrinking job market, and calls from reformers to integrate more practical skills and less theory into curricula. All of the panelists attributed the issues that law schools face primarily to the global financial crisis.
“We should theorize and teach about a world in transformation,” said Peer Zumbansen, a York University law professor.
Zumbansen said that law schools are engaged in a “frantic and restless catch-up game” in which they hire young professors to teach specialized courses. Many law schools now list more than 300 courses in their catalogs, he said, suggesting that they should set a lower cap on the number of classes that they offer. He also proposed a requirement that all law professors submit their curricula for scrutiny.
“That practice would, of course, rattle the cage,” Zumbansen said.
Indiana University law professor Fred Aman Jr. asserted that law school curricula have become not only more theoretical but also more skill-oriented in recent years.
“This is how it should be,” Aman said. “We need theory to know what our practical priorities should be.”
Aman said that law schools should develop a transnational curriculum that appeals to students worldwide. He predicted that while the overall applicant pool of would-be law students will shrink in the near future, law schools will see an influx of international students.
“There will be a new competition among law schools,” Aman said.
Harvard Law School professor I. Glenn Cohen said that there are three types of law schools.
The first, Cohen said, is typified by Yale, which produces “legal scholarship and legal scholars.” The second exists “almost exclusively” to teach public interest law; Cohen named Northeastern as an example in this category.
Cohen lumped all other types of law schools into a third catch-all category. In that group, he said, Harvard is “the best part of the undifferentiated product market.”
Apart from these three distinct types of schools, Cohen said that students who attend lower-tier law schools often express dissatisfaction after graduation because they had unrealistic expectations of the career opportunities they would find after completing their legal educations.
As law students face a shrinking job market and mounting student loan debt, Cohen predicted that law schools may mimic a transformation which dental schools passed through about 15 years ago: a decrease in the number of institutions accompanied by “increased scholarly output of faculty that was closer to practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in just his second match for the Harvard men’s squash team, sophomore transfer student Ali Farag was pitted against the reigning CSA Individual Champion and top-ranked player in the nation, Princeton junior Todd Harrity.
And despite picking up the first game, 11-7, Ali dropped the next two, putting himself in a do-or-die situation heading into the fourth. But although Harrity got off to a strong start in the pivotal fourth game, winning the first four points, the sophomore was able to turn the tide.
"At 2-1 and 4-0 down, I said to myself, ‘There’s no way you’re going to lose this match; do whatever you can,’" Ali remembered. "I started doing nothing but hitting the ball hard and running."
The tactic paid off, as Ali went on to take the match in five games, becoming the first player to beat Harrity since Harvard’s Colin West ’10 took down the then-freshman at the end of the 2009-2010 campaign.
But there’s more to this story than meets the eye.
Rewind about five years over in Cairo, Egypt, and Ali—discouraged with recent losses to players who had abandoned their studies to focus solely on squash—is on the verge of giving up the sport for good. That is, until his brother Wael steps in.
"He told me, ‘no, please give me a chance, I’m going to work with you, and you’re going to be good,’" Ali said.
Ali and Wael share more than just a last name, or even an aptitude for squash: The two brothers have also both worked toward the goal of being crowned Junior World Champion. But in 2008, Wael’s last shot at the world junior title ended in the round of 32—at the hands of none other than Harrity. The Farag brothers were devastated by the loss.
"I didn’t want to quit squash, but I sort of lost interest in squash [after that]," Ali explained. "I didn’t want to be down like my brother, and he’s the biggest figure in my life.... He told me, ‘No, I’m going to help you and maybe one day you’re going to beat him.’"
The day came sooner than expected—on Jan. 15 of this year, to be exact.
"It’s a small world," Ali said.
Training under his brother since age 15, Ali’s squash game drastically improved.
And after coming in second to rival and fellow Egyptian Amr Khaled Khalifa at the World Junior Championships in August 2010, Ali entered the British Open—a championship that Ali noted is "like a second world championship," with all of the world’s best players typically in attendance—the following January.
This time, Ali came out on top, earning the Junior World Championship as well as retribution against Khalifa with a three-game victory in the finals.
Ali is quick to credit his brother Wael for his success on the global stage.
"[Winning] is not only about squash technicalities," he said. "It has more to do with somebody who loves you, gives you support. All of the coaches, yes, they wanted to win, but for themselves, not for you. When I felt this feeling for my brother, I really improved a lot."
With a win at the British Open, Ali earned the status of the top junior player in the world, a title he still holds.
But although high-profile squash honors made it onto Ali’s radar at a young age, the sophomore never really dreamt of Harvard.
In fact, when asked repeatedly by his parents and family friends if he would consider playing squash for the Crimson, Ali’s answer was simple—no.
"I refused," he said. "And I know that Harvard is a great school. I knew that since I was 15 or something, but I didn’t want to leave Egypt."
But less than a month after his victory at the British Open, something happened in Egypt that helped change his mind: revolution.
"After the revolution, my parents took a different perspective talking to me about the issue of coming here," Ali explained. "They told me to go there and learn something because there are not many Egyptians that come [to Harvard]. Then, come back...and try to do something for Egypt."
Ali was convinced, and, after taking the SAT in May and applying, he found out in June that he had been accepted as a transfer student from American University in Cairo.
"I heard by phone, and I was screaming," Ali said. "[At first], I didn’t want to come at all, and then when I heard that I’m coming, I was screaming on the phone and my parents were crying. That’s how it all went."
And so far, Farag’s time at Harvard has gone over just as well. In his first four matches—Ali was forced to sit out the beginning of the season as the NCAA checked his eligibility—the sophomore has dropped just three games on the way to a perfect 4-0 mark so far.
"I’m really enjoying it here [at Harvard]," Ali said. "At the beginning, it was a bit overwhelming, and I was homesick, but I came here on the squash team and I knew 20 people all of a sudden.... I still miss [my family and friends], but I have another community here. I’m surrounded by so many friends, so I don’t feel homesick anymore."
Despite his dominant debut, Ali admits to getting more nervous before matches at Harvard than any he has played previously.
"[Playing in college] is a totally different experience," he said. "I’ve been playing world-class tournaments all over the world. I’ve traveled to 20 different countries for squash. [None of that] was as stressful as it has been here, playing college squash...because here I’m not only playing for myself, I’m playing for the whole team."
His team—which finished last season ranked fifth in the nation and looks to be a contender for the Potter Cup for the first time in at least a decade this year—is decidedly happy to have him around.
"He’s significantly better than everyone else on the team," co-captain Will Ahmed said. "Being able to learn from him and getting to watch him play and prepare is something that’s great for the team."
Coming off of a 7-2 victory over Rochester, Harvard hopes to continue its winning ways in the next few weeks, culminating in the CSA Team and Individual Championships.
"We have a very good chance [at winning nationals] if we play like we did [against Rochester], but only if we have this spirit," Ali said. "It’s all about spirit, not only about talent...and I believe that if there is a will, there is a way."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If the last few seasons were "building years," as the Harvard women’s water polo team likes to call them, 2012 is the squad’s chance to reach new heights.
Coming off a season in which it won its most games since 2005, the Crimson plans to continue its upward growth as its seniors, who have been the team’s primary leaders since they stepped on campus, play out their final season.
"I think we, as a [senior] class and as [a team], have been building toward this point for a while," co-captain Shannon Purcell said. "We have grown a lot in the past year, and we have been building on our improvements from previous years."
The Crimson, having graduated two non-starting seniors last year, will welcome back the three highest scorers of the past two seasons, co-captain Devan Kennifer, senior attacker Monica Zdrojewski, and junior attacker Aisha Price, all of whom are expected to lead the team to top its fifth-place finish at the 2011 Collegiate Water Polo Association Eastern Championships.
While Zdrojewski and Price put up very similar numbers in the goals, assists, and steals categories, two-time All-American honorable mention Kennifer was the force on last year’s team, leading the Crimson with 76 goals and 81 steals.
Kennifer’s numbers earned her much recognition last season, coming in the form of nods from both the CWPA Southern Division All-Conference First Team and the CWPA Eastern Championship All-Tournament First Team. This year, the Crimson expects the opposition to account for Kennifer’s notoriety in the pool.
But, as Harvard consistently proved last year, its wins are never one-woman shows.
Kennifer and her strong supporting cast are expected to capitalize on their depth and speed in 2012.
"We’re a very fast team," Harvard coach Ted Minnis said. "We have speed from top to bottom. Defenders are going to have to defend us all the way down the pool. We’re going to play from two-meter to two-meter, and we’re going to play hard in the lanes to make you earn everything you get. We’re going to grind it out."
Although Harvard’s roster remains largely unchanged from last season, the loss of senior goalie Laurel McCarthy could impede the continued growth of the team.
McCarthy and her impressive 184 saves last season were crucial to the Crimson’s success, earning her the program’s Most Improved Player award and a large leadership role on the team by the end of last season.
But McCarthy’s two torn labrums required her to get surgery, leaving the goalkeeper in recovery for the entirety of the 2012 season.
McCarthy’s injury will provide for the season’s biggest surprise in the season’s first game on Saturday at Iona.
"We will have a freshman starting in goal—that’s a major difference," Minnis said.
The opening in goal has left an opportunity for the other goalies on the team, freshmen Ariel Dukes and Jasmine Griffin, to see significant playing time this season.
Minnis has not announced which goalie will start in Saturday’s games, but he is confident that either freshman will be able to compete well with the rest of the returning starters despite the inherent pressure playing in goal.
"Both girls really fit into the style we play," Minnis said. "We have a very experienced team in front of them, so the goalies aren’t going to have to make those standing-on-their-head blocks. They’re just going to have to make the blocks they should."
This weekend, Harvard hopes to launch a winning streak similar to the 6-0 opening run it had last year. While the Crimson is favored in its games against Iona and Villanova this weekend, mimicking the start of its 2011 campaign will be difficult with Princeton—which went 3-0 against Harvard last year—approaching on Feb. 11. But for now, the Crimson is just looking forward to finally getting back into competition.
"We have been here since Jan. 2," Purcell said. "We went to Hungary and did all of this training. It gave us a lot of time to work on our skills, but at this point, we’re just getting antsy to start [the season]."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How awesome are movies?
Actors and actresses parading around the screen, interacting with directors and producers in the background, all in hopes of wowing the world with the next blockbuster.
And with blockbusters come Oscars, which then, of course, lead to fame, fortune, and, usually, rehab.
But where are the red carpet awards for films’ financial coordinators or locations managers or guys who snap the clapboard before each scene?
Thousands of people work together toward the final product of a movie, but relatively few get recognized. Sure, perhaps it is harder to act well than it is to hold a microphone over a set, but successful productions rely on the guys behind the scenes in order for things to run smoothly.
The same is true in Division I athletics.
Players are like the movie stars. Viewers come specifically to see them put on a show. Even coaches, through the success and style of their teams, can get widespread recognition without being in the spotlight, just like directors and producers can.
But the hard work and dedication that go into winning championships are not only demonstrated by coaches and players.
A long list of people crucial to an athletic program’s success do not receive championship rings at the end of a winning season. They are not featured in a newspaper’s headline. They rarely even get talked about.
Here, it’s the sports medicine staff. Strength and conditioning coaches. The laundry and equipment crew. Faculty fellows. Announcers and interns. The maintenance team for locker rooms and facilities. Alumni. Administrators who do scheduling and deal with the NCAA. The liaisons between the athletics department and other facets of Harvard. The list goes on and on.
They’re the offensive linemen of football, the air traffic controllers for flights, the house elves at Hogwarts. An industry can’t function without them, but few understand or are even aware of their importance.
The hours an athlete spends across the river training to be fitter, perfecting technical skills, treating and preventing new and old injuries are not only to make friends or fill free time. The point of visiting Palmer Dixon, the strength and conditioning facility, a few times a week is not to keep the staff company. An athlete’s commitment, in its most basic form, is to pursue victory. To win.
But the unsung heroes that work in the athletic department are some of the most altruistic people out there. They’re like the Mother Teresas of athletics—selfless and devoted, providing necessary services for athletes and never expecting anything in return.
Athletic trainers come to work at the crack of dawn to help with every last nagging injury, and not uncommonly they stay late, past the times their families want them home, to make sure post-practice rehabilitation has been taken care of.
As a member of the women’s soccer team, I know the laundry and equipment crew is at work before the earliest morning athletes arrive, performing a simple, yet crucial task that keeps the 41 varsity sports at Harvard in motion. They work even more on game days, nicely hanging each player’s uniform in our respective lockers so we can focus on the battle that lies ahead.
They know what sport we play, our names and our numbers. They know when we practice and when we play.
It’s something that’s easy to take for granted. But I can’t imagine traveling to an off-campus physical therapist during the busy school day to rehabilitate a sprained ankle or having to thoroughly research NCAA rules to guarantee that something small won’t affect my eligibility. I can’t imagine doing two-a-days and afterwards having to do laundry every time I come back to my room to face my schoolwork.
So next time you’re at a Harvard sporting event, as you’re being entertained by the play on the field, take a moment to appreciate how many people’s commitment to the Department of Harvard Athletics it took to allow you to be a spectator there, and don’t let their contributions go unnoticed.

Don't pack away those winter coats yet! This morning, Punxsutawney Phil, the famous groundhog-cum-weather prognosticator, emerged from his hole and saw his shadow. According to Groundhog Day lore, there will be six more weeks of winter.
