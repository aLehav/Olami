After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of the opening sequences of Peter Farrelly’s “Green Book,” Dolores (Linda Cardellini) offers two black plumbers glasses of water while they fix something in her kitchen. When her husband notices them in the sink, he throws them out without a second glance. This is Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen), a racist, cunning, wily bouncer hired to drive famed musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) while he tours across the Deep South. Based on a true story, Tony and Don’s ventures into the Deep South evoke a sort of “Driving Miss Daisy” in reverse that hinges on subverted tropes and flipped expectations: Don is black, wealthy, single, well-spoken, and dignified, while Tony is a white, roughhousing, inconsiderate, working class family man. Farrelly doesn’t stray too far from the comedic genre he is most known for, but in his tendency toward the lighthearted, he eschews impactful subtlety in favor of a feel-good movie with ultimately little substance.
While the film sheds light on a little known relic from the Jim Crow era, its screenplay fails to treat it with any legitimacy. “Green Book” refers to Victor Hugo Green’s “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” a guide black Americans traveling in the South used from 1936 to 1966 to avoid towns and establishments that sanctioned discrimination and institutionalized segregation. Tony’s failure to abide by the “Green Book” leads to a particularly charged, dangerous encounter with the police in a “sundown” town, in which black people were subject to arrest if found in public after sunset. Once Tony and Don are imprisoned, Don uses his connections to get them out of the situation, but not before imparting Tony with a lesson the film tries too hard to teach its audience: “You never win with violence. You only win when you maintain your dignity.” The screenplay is filled with a dozen such maxims, veering too far into the didactic and managing to resonate only thanks to the genuineness imparted by Ali and Mortensen.
Indeed, the film’s success rests largely on Ali and Mortensen’s tangible chemistry and respectively remarkable performances, enlivening the simplistic plot, screenplay, and otherwise one-note characters. Mortensen, who gained 45 pounds to embody the heavyset Tony, uses his body to enact a physical comedy familiar to fans of Farrelly’s past work, like “Dumb and Dumber,” in sharp contrast to Ali’s slim, tall physique that acutely evokes his regal nature.
Ali plays Don with almost severe sternness, his sharp, proper speech the perfect counterpart to Tony’s thick, New York, Italian-American accented vernacular. The two play essentially opposite characters, but come together in the shared authenticity of their respective portrayals: Mortensen’s Tony alternates between slouching and leaning back with a nonchalance that reveals both his privilege and laid-back nature, his body language carefully reflecting the character’s sense of identity; on the other hand, Ali’s Don walks tall, confidently, but never arrogantly, simultaneously alluding to the prodigy’s humility and elegance with which he teaches Tony to better himself.
For all the multiplicity of identity that the men teach each other — “So if I’m not black enough and if I’m not white enough, then tell me, Tony, what am I?” Don shouts at Tony at one of the emotional climaxes of the film; “You live in a castle. I live in the streets,” Tony tells Don at another point — the film is disappointingly too black and white (no pun intended) to impart its audience, or even its actors, with anything meaningful. At the end of the movie, Tony chastises his brother for using a racial slur to refer to Don. The moment is meant to reinforce Tony’s evolution from a man who would throw away glassware used by black men to one whose friendship with a black man has presumably cured him of his prejudice. Because, of course, now that Tony has a black friend in Don Shirley — one whose blackness Tony constantly questions — Tony has relieved himself of his racism, right?
By the film’s end, every trite, expected faux reflection on racism and classism has been fully realized. Ironically, Mortensen’s own behavior at a recent screening of the movie points to the film’s own failure to do what it so obviously wants to. When talking about the normality with which the n-word was used at in the ’60s, Mortensen uttered the full word, much to his co-star’s disappointment. Mortensen’s use of the word is not a fault of the movie itself, of course, but nonetheless mirrors the ignorance the film only superficially engages with.
“Green Book” is sure to be a crowd-pleaser — it won the People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and the National Board Review just named it the best film of 2018 — no doubt thanks to Farrelly’s acumen for comedy. But Farrelly has yet to learn how to balance the comedic with the consequential. “Green Book” is a fun road trip movie, but its didactic, facile sense of importance lacks the substance inherent in the pages of the book it was named for.
CORRECTION: Jan. 8, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the film as "The Green Book." In fact, the film's title is "Green Book."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 3, 2019 at 6:40 p.m.
Harvard Physics Professor Emeritus Roy J. Glauber ’46, whose pioneering work in the field of quantum optics earned him a Nobel Prize in 2005, died on Dec. 26. He was 93.
Glauber’s work expanded physicists’ understanding of the behavior of light as a particle, or photon, by combining the study of optics with the study of quantum physics, which describes how matter behaves on atomic and subatomic levels.
Glauber got an early start to his physics career when he left college in 1943 at the age of 18 to work in the Theory Division of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico. There, he joined dominant figures like J. Robert Oppenheimer and future Nobel-laureate Richard P. Feynman in determining the critical mass of the atomic bomb.
Long-time friend and colleague Sir Peter Knight said Glauber described his experience at Los Alamos as one that presented an “appalling, serious problem,” but a “fantastic nursery for understanding how physics is seriously done by the most talented of people.”
Glauber was one of the last living scientists to have witnessed the original tests of the atomic bomb in 1945.
After the war, Glauber returned to Harvard to finish his undergraduate degree and earn his Ph.D. After graduate school, Oppenheimer invited Glauber to conduct research at Princeton and subsequently arranged for him to replace Feynman in a teaching position at the California Institute of Technology.
Glauber returned to Harvard in 1952 and began ascending the academic ranks there, ultimately becoming a tenured physics professor. The development of the laser during that time laid the foundation for Glauber’s prizing-winning theory on the “quantum theory of optical coherence.”
This theory explains how the quantum structure of a laser beam’s “coherent light,” which has one frequency and phase, differs from the “incoherent light” emitted by a hot object, like an electric light bulb. It accounts for the behavior of the particles of light in the beam, thus providing a more comprehensive explanation of light’s dual properties as both a particle and a wave.
Glauber received one half of the 2005 Nobel Prize for combining the field of optics with quantum physics, and John L. Hall and Theodor W. Hänsch earned the other half of the prize for their work on precision spectroscopy.
Knight, a professor emeritus of physics at Imperial College London, said he believed the Nobel committee’s recognition of Glauber’s work was belated.
“His work really was acknowledged to be transformational 20 years before that, even 30 years before that,” he said.
But because Glauber’s work was theoretical, the full force of its impact has taken many years to unfold.
“He had to wait for activity in quantum optics to catch up with him,” Joseph H. Eberly, a professor of physics at the University of Rochester, said.
Just five days before Glauber’s death, for example, President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that allocates $1.2 billion over the next five years for advancing quantum information science. Glauber’s work helped lay the foundations for quantum computing, which processes data in faster, more sophisticated ways.
“His level of career scientific activity was actually rather small if measured in numbers of published papers,” Eberly said. “But those papers were and still are enormous in terms of influence.”
Following his Nobel recognition, Glauber spent time traveling to conferences and workshops. He was an active participant in events hosted by the Optical Society of America, which made him an honorary member in 2008.
“That’s one of the highest achievements that we can give someone from our community,” OSA CEO Liz A. Rogan said. “He was incredibly generous with his time and with his interest in giving back to the field.”
Glauber also served on the Advisory Board of the Max Planck Institute of Light in Erlangen, Germany. Knight, who chaired the board, said he and Glauber visited laboratories together, where Glauber would engage with students.
“The fact that he was this big Nobel Prize winner might have been a bit frightening to new graduate students, but he put everybody at their ease,” Knight said. “He was an extremely witty man, charming, full of insight, and would tease people quite a lot just to make them laugh.”
He recalled watching Glauber’s antics at the annual satirical Ig Nobel Prize ceremonies, where Glauber would appear as the “Keeper of the Broom” to sweep up the paper airplanes traditionally thrown by audience members.
Knight described the Ig Nobels as an event dedicated to “deflating the preposterous,” something Glauber readily participated in.
“It didn’t detract whatsoever from the way that he was utterly serious about how he regarded physics,” Knight said. “He was absolutely devoted to physics.”
Glauber was born on September 1, 1925 and grew up in New York City during the Great Depression. His mother was trained as a school-teacher and his father was a traveling salesman, so Glauber spent the early years of his life on the road, taking apart hotel-room radios and electrical wires to see how they worked. He quickly developed an interest in science, building a reflecting telescope and a spectroscope before starting college in 1941.
He later married Cynthia Rich ’56 in 1960, but the two divorced in 1975. At the time of Glauber’s death, Atholie Rosett was his long-standing partner.
Glauber raised his and Rich’s school-aged children, Jeffrey M. Glauber and Valerie Glauber Fleishman '92, on his own, a responsibility he has stated he would not have sacrificed for “some number of papers I never got to write as a result.”
“Both Jeff and Val have families of their own now and are busy raising my grandchildren,” he wrote in his Nobel autobiography. “I envy them that privilege, and wish I had the opportunity to be raising them all myself.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
— CHAPEL HILL, N.C. In a sea of Carolina blue, a small iota of Crimson red was visible among a crowd of over 21,000 spectators at Dean Smith Center on Wednesday night. A resilient bunch, the faithful Harvard legion maintained its hope for an improbable upset much throughout the first frame, when Harvard (6-6) clung briefly to a one-point, 20-19 lead at the eight-minute mark.
Even trailing by 10 at halftime did not seem too insurmountable of a deficit, as the Crimson held North Carolina (10-3) to a 3-of-12 line from deep and kept the score within six heading into the final stretch of the half, thanks to two triples from freshman Noah Kirkwood and junior Christian Juzang.
Harvard would also have revenge on its mind, after dropping a heartbreaking 67-65 final in the second round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament. The Crimson seemed unfazed by the prospect of taking on legendary coach Roy Williams in the Dean Smith Center, one of the most imposing arenas in college basketball. 
But soon after those brave folks donning the crimson settled back into their seats for the latter 20 minutes, the sliver of enthusiasm dissipated. A nine-minute field goal drought starting at the 16 minute mark doubled the halftime margin and left the Crimson fighting for respectability to close out a 77-57 game.
“Really tough for us to be able to run good offense with their length and athleticism,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “[UNC is] just obviously very fast in transition. We tried our [best] to keep them out of the open floor as best we could by getting back, but easier said than done.”
The drought contributed to a 16-1 Tar Heel run, which sucked the life from the small, but mighty Crimson crowd. What momentum Harvard had from the field in the first half was swept away in the second period, as the length and intensity of the Tar Heel defense allowed the hosts to pull away.
After knocking down 5-of-10 first half triples, the Crimson only converted on 3-of-14 second half three-pointers, and shot a paltry 34 percent from the field in the final 20 minutes. Harvard matched its season-low, scoring only 57 points against a highly touted Tar Heel defense. The Crimson continue to sorely miss juniors Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns, and games like Wednesday night help highlight the scoring vacuum their injuries have left.
“I even told [Tommy Amaker], ‘Just think if you had gotten Wendell Carter,’” Coach Williams said. “They could’ve been a top 10 team last year. I know without [Aiken and Towns] Harvard isn’t the team they’re going to be when they get those guys back.”
Further contributing to Harvard’s offensive tribulations were turnovers, which came early and often. A storyline that has haunted the Crimson all season, the visitors turned the ball over 12 times in the first half, and 22 times across the game’s 40 minutes. Entering the game 334th out of 351 Division I programs, Harvard’s performance Wednesday night will drop the team into the bottom 10 teams in the country in ball security, at 17 turnovers per game. 
“Our turnovers I thought really killed us,” said Coach Amaker. “But you have to give them credit for forcing us into areas in the times when we were kind of rushed and pressured and that’s when we turned some things over.”
Defensively, the Crimson battled valiantly against the 15th ranked team in the nation, doing its best to lock down offensive weapons Nassir Little, Luke Maye, Kenny Williams, and Cameron Johnson. Harvard had success limiting the offensive breakouts of North Carolina in the first half, but the second period offered a different story.
The Tar Heels broke out in the second half, opening up a 20-point lead that would allow the hosts to polish off an undefeated 7-0 non-conference record at the Dean Smith Center. Eventually, Little, Maye, Johnson, Williams, and the energetic Coby White would all finish in double-figures. Only Robert Baker reached 10 points for the Crimson, with Juzang chipping in nine points.
“Just trying to contain them and their transition offense is one of many things [that was challenging] and trying to make sure they don’t get any second chance points,” Juzang said. “[Coby’s] transition offense and the pace at which he pushes it is something we haven’t really seen before.”
In the midst of the second frame scoreless stretch, Amaker attempted to infuse some young energy by inserting all four freshmen simultaneously alongside junior forward Chris Lewis. The move was to no avail, as UNC went on an 8-0 run to widen the margin from 51-40 to 59-40 near the final ten minutes of play.
“I thought they really worked hard to do certain things that we were trying to get down to accomplish,” Amaker said, “Those young guys are going to be good for us and [there are] growing pains as we know, with young players, but we certainly like their futures.”
On the night, junior guard Bassey grabbed a season-high 11 boards. Lewis also tied a career-high of four rejections in an otherwise unsatisfying stat sheet for the visitors.
“I think we’re always one game away,” said Juzang of his team’s desire to remedy its mistakes. “I think things are starting to click here and there, and for us it’s about putting a full 40 minutes together.”
Longtime Dukie Amaker’s trip back to Tobacco Road concluded on unfavorable terms, but the nostalgia of his college days will take a backseat to more pressing priorities approaching the Ancient Eight campaign.
“It’s great to be back, but certainly we came here for an opportunity to hopefully get our team better,” Amaker said. “We get conference play starting up next so we have a lot of work to do as you probably saw.”
Harvard will travel to Hanover, N.H. to open its Ivy League season against Dartmouth on January 12th.
