After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This midterm season, you’ll be hard pressed to find a tranquil, unstressed Harvard student. March is saturated with overlapping deadlines, extracurricular comp meetings, and of course, heavily graded exams. For the majority of students solely focused on being students, the workload is manageable; but for those of us dealing with the excruciating pain of impacted wisdom teeth (without Massachusetts dental insurance), completing assigned work and taking care of personal health feels nearly impossible to balance.
Wisdom teeth are the third set of human molars that typically emerge during the college years, between the ages of 17 to 25. For the fortunate ones, wisdom teeth erupt upright, perfectly aligning with their existing teeth. However, for the unlucky ones like me, our mouths are too cramped for our wisdom teeth to develop correctly. The third molars become entrapped behind the crowded gum or jawbone, resulting in an unbearable pulsating pain from tension and bacterial infections.
As a first-generation low-income student (and immigrant), I never learned the inner workings of the United States healthcare system. Deductibles, copayments, PPO plans, and all other terminologies are — after six years in America — still strange to me. Despite the growing inflammation and pain in my gums, my initial reaction was not marked by concern. I expected that a prestigious institution such as Harvard would prioritize student access to medical care whenever needed, or so I thought.
In Massachusetts (and at Harvard), every student is required by law to have health insurance, whether it is provided by the university or they are covered by a “health plan of comparable coverage.” Based on my understanding, a significant proportion of affluent students already covered by excellent private insurance plans decide to waive their automatic enrollment in the Student Health Insurance Plan to de facto lower their cost of attendance. Conversely, students on significant financial aid, who may lack private health insurance, qualify for need-based grants to offset these expenses.
However, there is a separation between essential health insurance and other medical costs such as dentistry, and the SHIP only provides dental coverage to students until age 19. Despite their inherent necessity, there are no financial aid grants designed to cover “non-essential” medical insurances, regardless of current coverage or financial need.
After a few back-and-forth calls with Harvard University Health Services, unreturned calls to local dental schools, a series of painkillers, and advice to travel back home for wisdom tooth removal surgery, I learned my first hard-to-swallow Harvard reality: While wealthy students have the economic resources to afford private care, and in the worst case scenario, travel to see a doctor over the weekend, I am stuck in Massachusetts, unable to afford neither medical attention nor a plane ticket back home.
As my midterms approach, academics slowly fall on my priority list. The throbbing, pulsating pain in my teeth, gum inflammation, and low appetite remind me that even at an institution like Harvard, my socioeconomic status defines my capacity to succeed. While my peers can study for their exams, all I can do is ponder if my teeth will get any worse.
The Harvard Diversity and Inclusion mission aims to eliminate socioeconomic barriers to Harvard’s transformative experience, ensuring that “where one begins does not determine where one ends. ” Yet the College has failed to address the large number of disparate issues a diverse student body faces. For the first-generation, low-income community, access and understanding of all-encompassing health insurance is not granted, yet personal health is indispensable to reach the famous intellectual transformation Harvard preaches. Not covering dental insurance for students with financial need is a policy failure that hurts only the lower socioeconomic end of Harvard and cultivates inequalities in student potential for academic well-being.
This dental insurance policy is only the tip of the iceberg of Harvard policies that continuously alienate first-generation, low-income students. FGLI individuals come into Harvard unprepared, without reliable and accessible sources of information to navigate complex bureaucratic systems and academic adversity. These differences on the playing field most likely account for the 42 percent of low-income students that, despite attending Harvard, never become wealthy adults.
Teaching students healthcare literacy, especially those whose financial constrictions severely limit their experience within the complex Harvard world, is essential to level the playing field and close the achievement gap between low-income and wealthy Harvard students. This includes ensuring that financial aid covers all forms of medical care — including dental care — that are necessary to fully focus on academics and reach the full potential that Harvard facilitates.
In other words, provide students with the wisdom necessary to succeed, without forcing them to worry about their painful (wisdom) teeth.

A previous version of this story stated that 98.2 percent of low-income students who attend Harvard never become wealthy adults. In fact, the figure is 48 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I spent some of the summer after my first year at Harvard Law School working on the case against Purdue Pharma, the company that infamously produced and marketed opioids to horrific ends. That case, which has now been settled, opened my eyes to the awful truth of how the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma manufactured not just opioids, but the opioid overdose crisis we now find ourselves in. A staggering 107,600 Americans died in 2021 because of the crisis, 15 percent more than the year prior.
And so, when I came to campus that fall to begin my first in-person year at Harvard Law, I was shocked to see the Sackler name again — this time, prominently displayed on one of the three buildings that compose the Harvard Art Museums.
A sea change in public opinion, practical application, and even entertainment surrounding the opioid overdose crisis has begun to sweep through the country. Harvard has not just ignored that change, but steadfastly resisted it, choosing instead to defend the naming of the Arthur M. Sackler Building.
Harvard has upheld its ties to the Sackler family even as experts (including at this University) widely acknowledge them, via Purdue, to be responsible for organizing, fomenting, and ultimately profiting off the opioid overdose crisis and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. It’s unclear whether the University has officially responded to the latest proposal by students, earlier this academic year, to remove the Sackler name from the Harvard Art Museums.
The fact that the Sacklers have, through their immense wealth and influence, essentially purchased their immunity from prosecution tied to opioid-related lawsuits makes it so much more damning that Harvard, in maintaining the Arthur M. Sackler Building, continues to offer a prestigious platform for their toxic philanthropy.
Outside of the Harvard administration, the tide is shifting in how we as a society choose to respond to the opioid crisis. Two weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved over-the-counter sales of the overdose reversal drug Narcan, and we’ve seen renewed investigative reporting on elite institutions like Oxford University continuing to court the Sacklers. Just last month, President Joe Biden acknowledged the crisis in his State of the Union speech, and the month before that he signed a bill into law which will make it easier for people suffering from addiction to get the care they need. All told, we’re arriving at a tipping point for the opioid overdose crisis.
And yet, Harvard seems willfully immune to the growing awareness slowly capturing the rest of the country that we must take action. The new documentary “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” director Laura Poitras’ film about the life, art, and anti-overdose activism of artist Nan Goldin, put Harvard’s inaction into relief for me. It is a real-life David and Goliath tale that artfully illustrates how the Sackler family has leveraged the worlds of art and elite philanthropy to evade accountability, openly laundering their public image.
In 2018, Goldin organized a rally at Harvard to remove the Sackler name from our buildings. In other words: Harvard has had notice. This call to action is not new — Harvard has simply failed to respond.
“All the Beauty and the Bloodshed” also shows just how many other elite institutions have taken the opportunity to simply do better. Since that rally took place, institutions including The Louvre, The Guggenheim, London’s National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Modern, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art have all either scrapped the Sackler name or refused to take their money in future in the face of ongoing pressure from Goldin and her activist group, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, as well as increasing public awareness and outrage. These institutions’ actions have shown that, despite any nominal internal constraints pulling them elsewhere, stopping the glorification of the profiteers behind today's opioid overdose crisis is a goal that is not only worthy, but possible.
So why has Harvard held out?
The University contends that Arthur Sackler died several years before the proliferation of OxyContin from the company his family controlled, and is therefore irrelevant in discussions about his family’s ties to the crisis. Nevermind that it was Arthur Sackler’s aggressive advertising and supercharged sales schemes that provided the playbook and fertile ground for an explosion of OxyContin sales just years after his death.
It’s therefore easy to understand how a person like Arthur Sackler could possess both the ability to create an advertising scheme that skyrocketed use of opioids and a similar scheme to elevate his own family’s name via art institutions. Harvard is complicit in that calculated self-advertisement: Just as the Sackler family was able to deceive doctors and the public about the effects of opioids, Harvard and the Sacklers are deceiving the public about whether or not the Sackler family name is one worthy of our respect.
Outgoing university president Lawrence S. Bacow has referred to calls to remove the Sackler name from our buildings as “inappropriate,” citing “legal and contractual obligations” as an insurmountable challenge. And yet other institutions who have moved to reject Sackler money or remove their name from buildings have been able to rise to this challenge. As Claudine Gay begins her tenure as president this summer, there has never been a better time to cut ties with the Sackler family once and for all.
It is not a sign of weakness for Harvard to admit it has made the wrong call and join the side of progress, especially as the Harvard community pushes for change, year after year. It’s a shame it will have taken as long as it has, but the bigger shame would be continuing to prop up a family that has caused so much harm to so many.
Harvard, it’s past time: Sack the Sacklers.

Harvard Library hosted an event celebrating the reopening of Widener Library’s West Stacks Reading Room as a space with new artwork devoted to equity, diversity, inclusion, belonging, and antiracism on Tuesday morning.
As part of a month-long Faculty of Arts and Sciences initiative to celebrate the lives of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, the updated space now features artwork and literature representing marginalized groups, including works on disabilities, abolitionist history, and LGBTQ+ experiences.
Martha J. Whitehead, Harvard Library vice president and University librarian, shared her excitement for the reopening of the West Stacks Reading Room and future aspirations for the library.
“We’re excited by this opportunity to highlight our values in the very heart of Harvard Library, as we aspire to be a truly antiracist research library and a center of knowledge that addresses issues of bias and minimizes all forms of oppression,” Whitehead said in her opening statement.
Whitehead said the team sought to provide works that intersect issues of race and ethnicity with other experiences and backgrounds.
“We decided to focus on intersectionality across race and ethnicity to specifically help us learn more holistically about people’s experiences. Each subject contains works written by or about marginalized experiences from around the world, and we will continue to add materials overtime,” said Jerome Offord, Jr., the associate University librarian for antiracism.
“Within each subheading in the room, it has voices from all races, ethnicities, and people,” Offord said in an interview after the event. “We want it to really be about how we all belong holistically, and not just race or specific gender, but how we all have intersectional personal lives.”
MarQuis Bullock, a former Harvard Library intern, said in an interview following the event that the team aimed to innovate upon a traditional reading room.
“Our overall vision was to create a space of radical openness, a place of radical possibility.” Bullock said. “That would be a departure from what we normally think of when it comes to library spaces.”
Matthew Berdon, another former intern at the library, said the team sought to highlight media that takes on innovative forms.
“We really wanted to think outside the box when it came to the literature in the print and electronic media that was available for students and other members of the Harvard community to access,” said Berdon, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
One of the team’s “outside the box” ideas is a music playlist, curated to accompany the space. It features music from a diverse set of backgrounds and will be available for commercial streaming in the near future, according to Offord, the associate University librarian for antiracism.

Cambridge city councilors approved new amendments to local flood resilience standards and continued to debate on the weekend traffic closings on Memorial Drive at a City Council meeting Monday.
Councilors voted to adopt the flood resilience amendments proposed by the Community Development Department and Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, establishing a final effective date of Sept. 1, 2023, for the new standards.
The Council also passed an amended “Policy Order 5,” which allows for the extension of the Riverbend Park traffic closure located by Harvard’s river houses.
Many Cambridge residents once again voiced conflicted opinions over the traffic closures on Memorial Drive during the public comment hearing at Monday’s meeting, two weeks after a passionate debate arose at the last council meeting over the same issue.
The closure of Memorial Drive is “incredibly important for our neighborhood and for others,” said President of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association Suzanne P. Blier, who is also a professor of Fine Arts and of African and African American Studies at Harvard.
In a public comment on the road closure, Kenneth E. Reeves ’72, former Cambridge mayor and city councilor, said how the Council gathers public input is “off-putting” and “not democratic.”
“We need to find a democracy where everybody is heard and that the interests of those who don’t have the majority be accommodated in some ways,” he said. “We want the mayor and the councilors to help these neighbors out to a win-win solution.”
The Memorial Drive policy order was adopted by a 7-2 vote, with Councilor E. Denise Simmons and Councilor Paul F. Toner voting against the order.
“I personally feel that I really don’t care that we’ve gotten hundreds of emails from people who live in the Greater Boston area and the Greater Cambridge area when many of the people that live right there at the site of the closure are saying that they’re having difficulties getting in and out,” Toner said.
The Council also considered environmental policy changes, progressing through agenda items that included several communications from Cambridge City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05 — including the granting of appropriations for the purchase of an all-electric “rubbish packer,” updates to an initiative transitioning city vehicles to an all-electric fleet, and a new lease on electric vehicles for the fleet.
Councilor Nolan exercised her “charter right” — a councilor’s option to postpone discussion of and decisions on a topic to a later meeting — on the subject of Cambridge’s energy transition because she said she wanted to review the policy order’s wording further.
The Council will consider this and other orders of business at its next meeting this coming Monday.

Members of the Harvard Chaplains and other religious leaders hosted a vigil in Memorial Church on Tuesday evening to mark the end of Black History Month and honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King.
The vigil celebrated the Kings’ contributions to civil rights and economic justice movements within the United States. Speakers highlighted numerous pivotal moments in the Kings’ lives, discussing the March on Washington, the Poor People’s Campaign, and King’s famous letter from Birmingham Jail.
Tuesday’s ceremony concluded a month of programming, titled “Beloved Community,” organized by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging to celebrate the Kings’ legacy during Black History Month.
Speakers for the event included Assistant Minister for Memorial Church Calvon T. Jones, Harvard Muslim Chaplain Khalil Abdur-Rashid, Harvard Divinity School Associate Dean for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Melissa Wood Bartholomew, and Harvard Divinity School Dean of Ministry Studies Theodore N. Hickman-Maynard.
The Kuumba Singers of Harvard College, the oldest existing Black organization at the College, provided musical interludes between readings, including “Oh Freedom!” and “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ’Round.”
Abdur-Rashid discussed King’s “I Have a Dream” speech and said the most famous passage was “just one section” of King’s address. Often omitted are King’s criticisms of the U.S. government’s “failure to act in protecting human and civil rights for African Americans” and his demand that America live up to “its promises of emancipation and democracy,” Abdur-Rashid said.
“Like the peaceful grabbing of the nation’s capital, it was the largest assembly for redress of grievances that the Capitol had ever seen,” he said.
Speakers lauded King’s Poor People’s Campaign as a continuation of his lifelong work towards economic justice. The campaign called for a multiracial coalition of poor people to demand economic and human rights, and culminated in roughly 3,000 people camping out on the National Mall in tents made of plywood.
Following King’s assassination, his wife, Coretta King, played a vital role in carrying on the fight for civil rights and economic justice. Despite her significant contributions to the movement, speakers at the vigil said, her work has often been overlooked.
“There would not have been a Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. without Coretta Scott King,” Bartholomew said.
Closing the event, Aimee R. Howard ’25 and Bernadette R. Looney ’23 shared readings reflecting on the systemic inequality still present in the U.S.

Harvard Law School hosted a hybrid panel Tuesday afternoon on the emergency response and aftermath of the Feb. 6 earthquake for refugees of northwestern Syria.
Co-hosted by the Middle Eastern and North African Law Students Association and Program on Law and Society in the Muslim World, the event was moderated by Bonnie L. Docherty ’94, a lecturer at the HLS Armed Conflict and Civilian Protection Initiative and director of the International Human Rights Clinic.
The talk featured four panelists: Syrian earthquake survivor Mohammed Assi, Syria Civil Defence member Ammar Al-Selmo, Syrian British Medical Society General Secretary Abdulkarim Ekzayez, and Alexandra Tarzikhan, founder of Meet a Refugee — a social media page dedicated to sharing refugees’ stories.
The panelists’ conversation focused on the recent 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which has killed more than 50,000 people and displaced millions of residents in the area. Due to stalls in international relief efforts, ongoing conflict, and infrastructure damage, thousands still lack life necessities like food, water, heat, and shelter.
During the talk, Assi recounted how Syrian refugees were forced to sleep outside in freezing temperatures due to the collapse of buildings and the fear of aftershocks.
“I would like to describe the day of the earthquake as if it was Judgment Day,” Assi said through an interpreter. “There’s entire cities that were reduced to rubble.”
“About 80 percent of the population of west Syria lives below the poverty line,” he said. “So you can only imagine this compounded with the effects of the earthquake.”
Tarzikhan said populations along the border of Syria and Turkey are “being displaced for a second, third, or fourth time” since the start of the ongoing civil war in Syria.
“Since the start of the civil war in 2011, about 3.6 million people had fled from Syria to Turkey, according to the UN Refugee Agency,” Tarzikhan said. “So about half of this 3.6 million figure were living in areas that were close to the earthquake epicenter, and now live in a region with destroyed buildings, destroyed hospitals and roads.”
Ekzayez highlighted the impact of the earthquake on the already fragile Syrian healthcare system in addition to damage from the civil war.
“Because this area has been the last stronghold for opposition forces, the area witnessed the majority of attacks by the Syrian regime and their allies, destroying most of the civilian infrastructure in the area,” Ekzayez said. “We’re talking about residential buildings or hospitals, health facilities, bakeries, schools.”
Tarzikhan said it was important to not only provide immediate aid but also long-term support for affected areas to rebuild and recover.
“You have the immediate needs,” she said. “And also the mental health needs – significant levels of trauma brought on by many years of war, on top of seeing family members and tens of thousands of lost lives, leaving this population more vulnerable than ever.”
During the question and answer session following the discussion, Tarzikhan encouraged audience members to “continue this momentum on the crisis.”
“As media attention fades, that’s really when people on the ground are going to need us the most,” Tarzikhan said. “Because funding is going to stop trickling in and donations are going to stop trickling in, and I think it’s important to really think of this more from a long-term perspective.”

Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio underscored his belief in the importance of the State of Israel and expressed support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a Harvard Law School discussion Tuesday.
Held in a packed Wasserstein Hall classroom, the event — titled “The Progressive Case for Israel” — featured remarks by de Blasio, followed by a question-and-answer session with audience members. In his talk, de Blasio emphasized his belief in the continued need for Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people.
During the event, de Blasio recounted a Shabbat dinner his family shared with a Brooklyn official’s family, during which the official’s mother spoke about her experience living through the Holocaust. He also reflected on times when his own Italian relatives described Mussolini and fascism in a positive light.
De Blasio said that through moments like these, he realized that “that history was far from over in so many ways” and that “so many families are feeling the effects still and deeply right now.”
He also discussed why he supports Israel despite “fundamentally” disagreeing with elements of Israel’s current government. Israel, de Blasio said, is necessary because “the Jewish people are not sufficiently safe any place on this earth.”
In reference to geopolitical tensions in the region, de Blasio said he believes a two-state solution — which would create independent states of Israel and Palestine — is the only way to achieve peace in the region.
“Everyone needs a homeland, deserves a homeland. Everyone needs safety. I believe in a two-state solution as a way to achieve that,” he said. “I think anything short of that won’t achieve it, honestly.”
Concluding his remarks, de Blasio described his viewpoint as “progressive,” explaining that he believes in protecting those who are oppressed and that those enduring oppression should “have a homeland.”
In response to questions posed by the audience about the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, de Blasio said he does not believe economic pressure on Israel’s government would help achieve peace.
“I don’t buy the notion that forcing the government to change through economic boycott, for example, is productive to the long-term outcome,” he said.
Still, de Blasio said he believes an economic solution is crucial to implementing a two-state solution.
“We cannot treat economic issues and political issues as two ships passing in the night,” he said in an interview following the event. “We have to rebond these two points and create an economic framework that will be, to me, the underpinning of a lasting peace.”
Some audience members said they were left unsatisfied by de Blasio’s talk.
Tala A. Alfoqaha, a second-year law student at the Law School, said she believes the talk lacked substance and de Blasio used “the same political playbook that every politician goes by.”
“I presented a vision that needs to be revived that is pertinent today,” de Blasio said when asked for comment. “If people think a two-state solution is not advancing, then the job should be to advance it and work on it, not just decry its lack of progress.”
Charles S. Comiter, a Ph.D. student at MIT who attended the event, said he doubts the viability of the two-state solution promoted by de Blasio.
“I think there’s a whole multitude of reasons that we’re not going to see a two-state solution ever,” he said. “I think that’s a pretty widely accepted viewpoint.”
In a response, de Blasio defended the two-state solution, saying that while he believes it would be difficult to implement, it is also the best way forward.
“I was very interested in the dialogue today. I thought students were very thoughtful — wide-ranging views obviously,” he said. “But I did not hear anyone present a more available coherent option.”

You’re finally three-quarters of the way through your first year at Harvard and feel comfortable in where you stand: you have a solid group of friends, don’t have to use Google Maps to get to class, life is good. Right? Wrong. You’re now caught in blocking drama — a group of seven with one spot left… Who will it be? We see you making waiting lists, and even deciding based on WEALTH (come on now), but trust us, there are clearly better alternatives to solve this problem. Here are five strategies to determine who will be the last person in your blocking group!
Judge Them Based on Their SAT Score/Common App Essay
Harvard may go test-optional, but your Canaday Clan can’t risk it. Prioritize the 99th percentile test-takers and those with beautifully written personal statements — they’ll be useful to you in the future. Or, if you want an ego boost, capitalize on the grammar mistakes and go the other way around!
Set Up Survivor-esque Challenges for Them
A race from Pennypacker to Holworthy. An all-out brawl in the Berg Balcony. A competition to see who will pick up the phone first and buy you Mucinex from CVS. Never before will your prospective blockmate be so glad they went to the Hem that one time.
Have them Write a 500-Word Response Essay
Have fun with this one! The prompts should be what is essential to know about people you may live somewhat close to for the next three years. Questions can range from “What kind of fruit are you?” to “Who in the current blocking group would you go to first with gossip?”
Make Them Fill Out a Google Form
Learn from the First-Year Experience office! 5 p.m. on the dot, form released. The first hopeful blocker to respond will be the person lucky enough to enter your group. To test for speed and agility, make sure that the questions vary in style: “Check all boxes that apply: Red Flags?”; “Short answer: What are your big three signs, and do you believe that they accurately represent you?”; “Multiple choice: Which blockmate is the hottest?”; etc. Get their brain juices flowing — you only want the best of the best, after all.
Have a Required-lecture Comp
Taking from some of the most successful clubs on campus, you and your blockmates can create a lecture format to turn the candidates into idealized versions of themselves. Maybe have a seven-lecture series where the expectations of a blockmate are presented via Google Slides presentations and Learning Catalytics polls. Make sure to attach an attendance Google Form at the end and warn them that there are no make up sessions. Only the most competent shall survive.
At the end of the day, though, it’s not that deep. That's all. Good night.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when an academically challenging degree gives you academic challenges…? No matter how transformative of a college experience you’re having, nonstop working and class-ing and extracurricular-ing will eventually drain you. Unfortunately, the draining sometimes happens during exam season. We can’t promise we’ve got you totally covered this time, but we’re definitely going to try. Here are our tips on how to ward off that midterm malaise.
Disclaimer: I am not a therapist. Malaise and burnout can be symptoms of mental/physical illness. If you believe this applies to you, please contact a medical professional ASAP. You are not alone. <3
Bribe yourself
Get yourself a smoothie because you finished that pset. Take yourself out to dinner because you finished your paper. On a hard and tiring day, promise yourself that after classes are over, you’re going to crawl into bed and watch a comedy special. Set reasonable goals and NEVER deprive yourself of nice things as self-punishment! Reward yourself for all the hard work you do!!
Delete those mindless-scrolling apps
After a few bleary days without funny TikToks or juicy AITA posts, your dopamine-desperate brain will even be excited about a pset. Yeah, maybe that’s bleak, but you gotta do what it takes.
Make pretty notes
You don’t even need to go out and buy pastel highlighters. Grab a pen and a highlighter, or Google “copy paste symbols” for free little icons to spice up your typed notes. It doesn’t need to look like the aesthetic pictures online — what matters is that you’re enjoying it. Studying is way less boring when it’s basically an art project.
Pay attention in lecture and section
This may seem painful, but trust me, you are saving yourself time later. Close your laptop and whip out a notebook if you have to. It’s okay (and normal!) to not get everything even when you’re distraction-free. It’s also okay and normal to not remember an ounce of it when assignments come around. Just do your best! Reviewing material you’ve heard before is a lot easier and quicker than learning all of it for the first time. Might as well get the learning and attendance down at the same time, and spend that saved time before your exams getting good sleep and having a nice meal or doing a face mask or something.
Study with a buddy
And by buddy, I mean a friend that looks like they have it all together. Oftentimes, their energy will rub off on you and you’ll be super productive. Also, That Friend probably doesn’t actually have it all together, so they’ll be really glad to have your company.
Get out when the sun is out
Sunshine totally changes your mood. If it’s too cold outside, make sure you study by a nice big window :)
Every night, lay out the coolest possible outfit for tomorrow
And then your alarm will ring tomorrow, and your first thought will be that this is horrible and you are exhausted and you should go back to bed. Your second thought will be, “Wait a second… Skip lecture? And let all of Chem 27 miss out on this FIT I was gonna THROW?” Then you’d have to get up and put on that outfit and go to lecture, or else you would be depriving all your classmates of the most beautiful sight they will see that day, and that would be mean.
If none of these resonated with you, that’s okay! Motivation is not one size fits all. These are the things that have helped me, and I hope they can help you too. If they didn’t, I hope you’ve at least been inspired to think about how to brighten up your day instead of just dragging yourself along. Because let’s be honest: no one knows you better than you. So no one is going to be able to treat you better than you! Let’s treat ourselves and get through this semester together.
