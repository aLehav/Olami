After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Senior Night at Lavietes Pavilion was delayed by a year for Kyle Casey and co-captain Brandyn Curry, taking the court was no less emotional.
Returning from a yearlong leave of absence at the beginning of the 2013-2014 season, the seniors overcame a slow start in their second-to-last home game to handily defeat Cornell (2-24, 1-11 Ivy), 72-47.
“We said, ‘Can you believe it?’” Curry said. “It’s [one of] our last time[s] suiting up at our home floor, but it didn’t hit us until they called our names at the court. [I] gave Kyle a hug and said, ‘This is it. It’s real now.’ The whole week we were busy with other stuff, so it didn’t hit until it was here. The moment [was] here.”
Although it was a matchup between the best and worst teams in the conference, the Crimson (24-4, 11-1) and the Big Red looked to be on equal footing through the first five minutes. All four eligible seniors—Tom Hamel, the squad’s fifth senior, is out for the season with a knee injury—were tapped to start, with Casey, Curry, and Dee Giger playing alongside co-captain Laurent Rivard and sophomore guard Siyani Chambers.
The Crimson looked to get it going early with a quick three-point attempt from Giger, but the shot went long. Casey could not finish on a feed under the net after Big Red junior Devin Cherry airballed from deep, and neither team got on the board in the first three minutes. Cornell freshman Darryl Smith finally broke the logjam, driving to the basket and finishing in traffic.
Cornell jumped out to a 4-0 lead and kept Harvard scoreless for close to five minutes before Chambers ignited the Crimson offense with a long ball of his own.
“We never really went out and practiced with that lineup,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “You expect some things like that, and some nerves. We settled in, and I thought we played with great poise and efficiency throughout.”
Despite opening the game shooting 0-of-5, the Crimson finished with a 51.1 percent mark from the field, better than either of last weekend’s games at Penn and Princeton. Led by Chambers, who went 4-of-6 from deep en route to 15 points, Harvard capitalized on gaps at the perimeter and hit eight threes, its highest mark since its last matchup against Cornell.
Up four with eight minutes to play in the opening period, the Crimson began to pull away with back-to-back threes from Casey and Chambers. Junior forward Steve Moundou-Missi closed out the half with two free throws to extend Harvard’s lead to 16.
Cornell got back into it after the break, and the two teams exchanged points for the first five minutes of the second period. Senior Dwight Tarwater chipped in six of his 10 points on two three-pointers within two minutes.
But the Crimson regained control with treys from Chambers and Rivard in quick succession, and after the five-minute mark, the Big Red never got within 16 points.
“[Cornell was] still fighting and competing, and they certainly did that at the beginning of the second half,” Amaker said. "We had a few possessions there that were sloppy, and we needed to correct them and halt the slide we had. I think it worked. We halted our slide right there.”
Wracked by injury, Cornell dressed only 10 players, all of whom saw playing time. After starting its four eligible seniors, Harvard used 15 of its players. Freshmen Matt Fraschilla and Zena Edosomwan both spent a minute on the court and racked up an assist and a field goal, respectively.
The Crimson dominated the glass, pulling down 34 rebounds to Cornell’s 18, more than doubling the Big Red’s total on the defensive boards. Junior forward Jonah Travis paced Harvard with five rebounds, while Smith chipped in four for Cornell.
Despite the mismatch in the standings and a more difficult—and title-deciding—matchup against Columbia on Saturday night, the Crimson prepared for the Big Red no differently.
“Coach always tells us about taking care of the here and now,” Casey said. “We knew that [Columbia would be] an important game, but it wouldn’t have been important if we dropped this one…. It wouldn’t have been seizing the moment. We were focused on what we needed to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the opening spurt of its game against Cornell (2-23, 1-10 Ivy), the Harvard men’s basketball team (23-4, 10-1) played like the last—not first—place team. Four and a half minutes in, a layup by Cornell freshman Darryl Smith put the visitors up 4-0. To that point, the Crimson had two turnovers and five missed shots.
But Harvard quickly restored order—in the next 15 minutes, it would miss just five more times. The Crimson scored on three of its next four trips down the court to take a 7-6 lead with 12 minutes to go in the half.
And once Harvard had found its form, it didn’t lose it again, eventually coming away with a 72-47 victory. The Crimson scored 23 of the next 24 points coming out of the under-12 minute media timeout, taking a 16-point lead into halftime.
For the game, it finished 51 percent from the field, 44 percent from three, and 86 percent from the line—excellent marks on par with those of NBA leading scorer Kevin Durant’s season-long 51-40-88 shooting splits.
“We were efficient on the offensive end, how we shot the ball, how we moved it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
The Big Red cut the lead to 11 four minutes into the second half, but Harvard responded with another run. The Crimson scored eight straight and pushed its lead to 20 with nine minutes to go.
Nine different Harvard players logged double-digit minutes and 10 had a basket as the Crimson dominated on both ends, holding Cornell to 39 percent shooting from the field.
“I thought our defense was outstanding throughout, especially in the first half,” Amaker said. “There [were] a lot of positive things for our group.”
A NIGHT TO REMEMBER
At the start of the game, Amaker continued an annual Senior Night tradition, starting all his seniors. He started seniors Kyle Casey and Dee Giger and co-captains Laurent Rivard and Brandyn Curry alongside sophomore point guard Siyani Chambers. It was the first time the five had ever seen the court together.
The early returns were less than impressive.
Although the unit excelled on the defensive end, holding Cornell to just one fast-break layup, it struggled to score. In four minutes, Harvard missed all five shots it took from the floor.
“They knew that we were going to start our seniors, and I don’t know it that played a role with Dee and Brandyn being out there for that moment,” Amaker said. “Those things happen.”
It wasn’t until junior Wesley Saunders replaced Giger that the offense got going. On his second play, Saunders dished to Chambers for a three-pointer to bring Harvard within one. By the time that Saunders left the court, 13 minutes later, Harvard had taken a 30-13 advantage.
The large graduating class—if not for an injured Tom Hamel, Amaker would have had an entire starting senior unit—was a 180 degree change from last year, where now-assistant coach Christian Webster ’13 was the only graduate honored.
THREE-TWO, DEE-TWO
Coming in as a starter, Giger acted the part. As the team’s nominal small forward alongside Rivard and Casey in the frontcourt, Giger provided an unusual starting lineup with a bit of floor spacing. In his five minutes on the floor, Giger took two shots from behind the arc.
“For Dee to get a start…. I am very happy about that,” Amaker said. “We were able to have a nice moment, for all the seniors but also for Dee in particular.”
Both times Giger got off a good look, but was unable to knock it down. After the game, Amaker said that he was happy to see the senior—who has now made only one of nine threes on the season—take the shots.
“He was open [and] he’s a shooter,” Amaker said. “I thought he was going to make them.”
Although Giger sat for the next 34 minutes, he took the court one last time late in the second half. He played just a minute more before spending the last 85 seconds on the bench.
“It was good to see those guys out there and able to partake in a moment like that,” Amaker said. “Having done it myself, you remember that for a long time—for a lifetime.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Goals from senior defender Danny Fick and freshman forward Phil Zielonka propelled the Harvard men’s hockey team (10-14-4, 6-11-4 ECAC) to a 2-1 victory at No. 16/15 Colgate (16-12-5, 12-6-3) in the penultimate game of the regular season.
After a scoreless second period, Zielonka broke a 1-1 stalemate less than seven minutes into the final frame of regulation. After receiving a redirected Colgate clearing attempt from sophomore linemate Greg Gozzo, Zielonka split the legs of freshman defender Brett Corkey and beat rookie goaltender Charlie Finn glove-side with a high wrist shot from just inside the right faceoff circle.
The Raiders got on the board first with a power play marker from sophomore forward Murphy Darcy at 7:39 in the opening frame. Minutes later, Harvard failed to find the back of the net on an extended 5-on-3 opportunity after Colgate was whistled for consecutive penalties 36 seconds apart.
The Crimson’s tying response came from the unlikeliest of its skaters. With just over two minutes left in the first period, Fick rushed the Colgate crease and batted a crossing feed from freshman forward Luke Esposito out of the air and past Finn for the senior defender’s first career goal in 93 collegiate games played. Fick's strike also ended a streak of 33 straight goals scored by Crimson underclassmen.
Colgate outshot Harvard, 9-2, in the third period, but sophomore goaltender Steve Michalek finished with 33 saves to collect his fifth win of the season. The victory was the Crimson's first road win over the Raiders since 2006.
With only Cornell left on Harvard's regular season schedule, the Crimson sits in a three-way tie for ninth place in the ECAC and within a point of home ice for the first round of the postseason conference tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first games of the spring season, the Harvard baseball team’s defensive struggles led to its dropping both games of Friday’s doubleheader at Oral Roberts, 6-4 and 4-3.
The Crimson (0-2) squandered a strong first start by sophomore right-hander Sean Poppen, who threw six-plus innings and gave up three earned runs on six hits. After Poppen walked the first batter of the bottom of the seventh, Harvard coach Bill Decker handed the ball to junior Matt Timoney.
Timoney threw to three Golden Eagles (3-6) batters, with two reaching on errors by Timoney and senior second baseman Kyle Larrow to load the bases.
Sophomore T.J. Laurisch took over on the hill and promptly gave up a bases-clearing double to Matt Brandy. Oral Roberts’ two-run lead stood for the final two frames, and the Crimson suffered a loss in its first game of the season.
In the second contest, Harvard spotted the Golden Eagles a 3-0 lead by the end of the third inning, but bounced back with a run in the fourth on an Oral Roberts error and two in the eighth on a passed ball and a single by junior catcher Steve Dill.
With the score knotted at three after seven-and-a-half innings, Harvard senior reliever Danny Moskovits hit Brandy with the pitch, and the Golden Eagles third-hitter advanced on a wild pitch to second and to third on a groundout to second. With one out and the count 0-0, Moskovits balked, forcing Brandy home for the go-ahead run to put his team up 4-3. The Crimson bats were silent in the ninth, leading to Harvard’s second close loss.
The Crimson face off against the Golden Eagles on Saturday afternoon for another twin bill to complete its first series against Tulsa in Harvard history.

As soon as the clock hits 1:30AM, Tasty Burger instantly begins bustling with activity. I was just enjoying a guilty late night snack when I couldn’t help but overhear all the weird things that people were saying.

 
1.A: “Dude this place is so crowded. Why do people even come here?”B: “I know right, I wouldn’t be here if I were them.”
2.A: “...He was really cute, I would have dated him.”B: “What happened?”A: “He went to Yale.”
3. A: “...resolving to conform one’s conduct to the natural laws of justice, does that mean     that individual forfeits moral liberty?”B: “I don’t know but this burger is soooo good. ”
4. Looking at the menu items on the wall:A: “I’ve tried everything and it’s depressing.”B: “If Shake Shack opens longer it would earn so much money.”
5. A middle aged man to another slightly older man.A: “Where did these kids come from? They are all drunk! They are not Harvard students are they?”B: “No, they can’t be. The Harvard kids must be in their room reading or something.”
6. “I just love sad songs. They make me so happy.”
7. A: “Dude, is that your drama costume?”B: “I’m fabulous. Now get in line.”
8. “Everybody is so drunk, I love watching drunk people.”
9. A: “Hey how are you?”B: “I’m good, you?”A: “I’m great, how are you?”
10. After making a high pitched whining sound for a full minute:"...what else would a whale say?!"
 
Things I learned from my peers at 1:30AM: A) I shouldn’t date Yale guys, and B) Instead of attempting to study by eavesdropping on drunk Gov 10 students, I should be in a library reading, just like all the other Harvard kids.
