After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Amazon released the first Kindle in 2007, the device was hailed as a game-changer. Its sleek form factor begged to become a part of your morning commute. Its expansive grayscale screen demanded you discard your physical media. Its online library jockeyed noisily for you to join a digital revolution. Only three years later, the e-book industry has proven robust and lucrative, with Kindle-alternatives like Barnes & Nobles’ “Nook” expanding the menu of digitized media options.
However, with the rise of the e-book came the fall of writers’ paychecks; literary authors, in particular, are seeing paltry advances and lower profits for their potential masterpieces. Whereas in decades past ingenious works-in-progress would earn their authors sizable advances, many attempting to craft ground-breaking material today find it difficult to make a living by writing fiction.
Although this is undoubtedly an unfortunate trend, it requires creativity and action on the part of the author, not a fixation with eras past. The trend toward e-books is here to stay, and authors who pretend otherwise would do well to embrace this reality.
Fortunately, the same electronic era that has stripped authors of some of their revenue stream has also provided them with tools to increase their visibility and get word of their new releases to the public. Social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube offer low-cost ways to help authors become their own hype machines. Internet strategies like these democratize publicity as a resource, and authors should strongly consider publishing and marketing methods that don’t leave them vulnerable to the profit-sharing inclinations of publishers.
These suggestions are not meant to ignore the plight of the book industry. In an ideal world, publishers could afford to give authors more of the profit, but  expecting that they will do so anytime soon is unrealistic. Many traditional publishers are suffering from decreased book sales and revenue, and have yet to make substantial changes to the industry model. They too must acknowledge the changing times and reconsider their publishing methods in an age where e-books represent an entirely new and different beast.
The e-book revolution is an exciting change that introduces a cheap, paperless, and widely accessible alternative to traditional print media. It is clearly good for the environment and benefits society as a whole by increasing access to texts. If authors embrace it and explore novel solutions to their monetary woes, it will kindle an entirely new era of publishing, with widespread benefits.

Harvard’s wireless internet coverage can be patchy—just ask anyone with class in Sever. But professors who teach in the few classrooms without wireless internet should enjoy it while it lasts. Before long, new technology will bring distracting YouTube videos to every square inch of campus.
The five-member Federal Communications Commission unanimously approved new rules last week which allow wireless devices to transmit in the television spectrum, enabling faster speeds, more network capacity, and much greater range for Wi-Fi devices. Never mind the effects on college lectures—the new rules will strengthen our economy and standard of living by providing broader and better internet access across America and by allowing rapid communication between devices like TVs and computers in new and exciting ways.
The new regulations open up frequencies between analog television channels, called “white spaces,” which were originally meant to guard against interference. Waves in this lower frequency spectrum can penetrate walls, travel for miles, and transmit data as fast as a cable modem. That means single Wi-Fi hotpots could cover entire buildings or even city blocks.
The FCC’s decision to allow unlicensed access to the spectrum, rather than auctioning off sections to the highest bidder, as has been their custom in the past, is one of the plan’s biggest strengths. Though it won’t generate revenue for the federal government, open access to white spaces will give even startup companies a chance at creating unique devices which take advantage of the technology’s long range.
Given the many potential applications of the technology, allowing open access to innovators makes perfect sense. The new, stronger Wi-Fi may open up new avenues for home entertainment, allowing transfer of high-quality video clips between computers, televisions, and other screens around the house. In addition, providers of emergency services will be better able to service disaster regions or monitor health of patients.
Devices that use white spaces may also be the cheapest way to provide high-speed internet connection to remote regions of the U.S., where phone and cable companies often will not provide broadband through the landlines. Doing so may help close the sizeable connection speed gap between the U.S. and other countries like Korea or Sweden.
If freeing up white spaces can generate several billion dollars in annual revenue, according to one Microsoft study, then why didn’t the FCC act earlier? Certain technology companies began been pushing for the FCC to open up the spectrum between the TV channels as early as 2007.
The FCC dragged its feet in the past because of concerns about interference, and rightly so. If a cell phone on the street mistakenly broadcast on the same frequency as the wireless microphones inside a concert venue, it could bring a Ke$ha concert screeching to a halt. Some earlier FCC plans to placate the opposition not only provided for a database of blocked frequencies but would have also required devices to perform an electronic search of frequencies in use. However, the FCC is right to drop the search requirement, a redundancy that would have made new devices more expensive. The new plan relies on the database of used frequencies and also reserves two channels for wireless microphones, which is an apt compromise.
Pundits who worry about confusion and interference problems underestimate the ability of the free market to resolve frequency disputes on its own. The last thing phone manufacturers want to see is a newspaper article about how their product shut down the microphones at the Super Bowl.
Given the promise of the technology, it is a shame that opening up the white spaces could not have happened years ago. However, claims that the new rules come too late, are too limited, or are simply timed to affect the November election, are hogwash. Phone and computer companies will eagerly resume production on white spaces-enabled devices as soon as they are given the opportunity.
Systems using white spaces communication have already been shown to work in the field. The city of Wilmington, N.C. has already been running a successful test of a wireless network using white spaces. Their system collects data from traffic cameras, allows police to view real-time security feeds from around the city, and broadcasts data from water sensors previously reachable only by boat. Expanding the technology to big cities like New York City might be more difficult, given the number of theaters and bars which use wireless microphones, but the Wilmington case, as several tests by Microsoft and others confirm, shows that the technology is viable and has real benefits.
In this economy, we should by no means allow a vital resource, even something intangible like a frequency spectrum, go unused. Opening up the white spaces for wireless communication was a no-brainer, and the changes to the rules cannot go into effect soon enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Besides the name, fame, and glory, one of the things that drew me to Harvard was its diversity. Needless to say, I was awed by how the College successfully brought people together across lines of race and religion, teaching them to embrace the multitude of ideas and beliefs. It was easy to see that the people really were the best part of Harvard—and I hadn’t even met them yet.
But rather than using the opportunity to get to know a variety of individuals, many student organizations that promote themselves as "cultural and racial initiatives" instead promote communities where students prefer to socialize within their own racial group as a social fallback. This maintains division within the student body and discourages individuals from branching out socially, defeating the purpose of having such a wide range of people with whom to interact.
Like other student organizations, cultural groups can create support systems and social networks for students that provide assistance and comfort in times of need. Besides allowing upperclassmen to serve as mentors for underclassmen, these support systems let groups take pride in their members' individual achievements. However, when group activities are focused largely on socializing rather than on sharing cultural values and beliefs, members become increasingly dependent on the group as a social support. This takes away from the cultural promise and what serves as the initial draw for many joining a so-called cultural organization.
There is nothing wrong with student groups serving as social organizations or even social support systems, but they should not solely serve this purpose under the pretense of cultural outreach and enrichment. Put plainly and simply, this is false advertisement at its worst. Many people join such organizations in the hope that they can be a part of a Harvard community that is more aware of the culture and values pertaining to a particular region. Perhaps they do so in order to celebrate festivals, rituals, and customs with others who can appreciate them in turn. Instead, they are faced with a group made up of people who happen to be brought together by their race with purely social purposes in mind.
Of course, having a readymade network can be appealing as it cuts the intermediary work of having to find one’s own social niche. However, making friends in this context can reinforce stereotypes and promote racial cliquishness. Even if friendships and relationships in so-called “cultural initiatives” can be deep-rooted and long-lasting, it is important for Harvard students to branch out as well and embrace the university’s diversity with open arms. It works the other way, as well; true cultural and racial initiatives ought to encourage so-called outsiders to join by educating and informing them. Diversity is a draw, as well, and these organizations can attract more members through this positive feedback cycle.
In order to stay true to their taglines as cultural initiatives, these student organizations ought to retain and emphasize some of the cultural aspects that they claim. This is best done through outreach; language tables, performances, and other events—especially those involving a sample of the local cuisine—are effective ways of educating the larger Harvard community, a goal that seems to be a common thread through many cultural groups. For example, the South Asian Association’s dance production “Ghungroo” and the African Students’ Association’s hosting of “Africa Night” are the kinds of events that help such organizations stay true to their word while helping members be a proud part of something more meaningful than an effective social club. Those, we already have.

The fast rise of the Tea Party as a national political force has had a surprising impact on the 2010 Republican primaries. At times, it has even proven to be impressive in its ability to effectively fund-raise and elevate relative unknowns into the political limelight. Names like those of Republican senatorial candidates Joe Miller of Alaska, Sharon Angle of Nevada, and Christine O’Donnell of Delaware have become the focus of many a dinner table discussion in recent weeks. However, the Tea Party effort, with its initial focus on saving the country from economic ruin, has become hijacked by a desire for purity tests and fiery rhetoric that will ultimately prove counterproductive to the sort of tangible results that the American people are hoping for in a time of dire economic need.
Think of why President Obama currently has his lowest approval rating on record. Simply put, it’s because he, along with large liberal majorities in Congress, has been unable to successfully address the economic crisis with the speed and urgency that the American people deserve. Asked in a recent poll to rank the three most pressing issues today, Americans overwhelming stated that the economy, jobs, and federal spending are the three that will shape how they will vote in November. The inability of Democrats to act swiftly and aggressively to fix the economic mess has left the American people again looking to the Republican Party for financial sense and fiscal responsibility. Poll after poll suggests that this is the year for Republicans to emerge from the political death that had been presumed after the 2008 elections.
However, there is one small caveat: Republicans can only win if they focus on the issues that matter. This is where the Tea Party has become a complicated ally. By focusing on purity tests within the ranks of the Republican Party, candidates for office have emerged that have some questioning the possibility of a cohesive Republican effort come January 2011. Luckily for Republicans, the Tea Party movement has chosen to align itself with the GOP, which will allow it to carry forth additional momentum into the fall in states where Republican victories are all but certain, like in Utah and Kentucky. However, the selections of O’Donnell in Delaware and, to a lesser extent, Angle in Nevada place serious doubts on a roadmap to congressional majorities come Nov. 2. O’Donnell is not expected to win the Senate seat once held by Vice President Joe Biden, unlike the defeated Congressman Mike Castle, who would have been the closest thing to a sure thing in American politics. And Angle has placed hurdles on the path to defeat Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Recent decisions by Governor Charlie Crist in Florida and Senator Lisa Murkowski in Alaska to run as third-party candidates further jeopardize Tea Party-backed candidacies.
And even if a moderate GOP and conservative Tea Party partnership proves successful in gaining congressional seats, there will still be plenty of bad blood between the establishment, which suddenly finds itself on the defensive against a very loud grassroots, conservative unit.  There is very little expectation that the two groups will agree often on policy proposals, particularly on social issues, continuing what has often been dubbed as civil war within the Republican Party. This in turn can spell trouble for Republican efforts to present a united opposition to the Obama administration’s domestic policies.
With an emphasis on issues ranging from immigration and abortion, to gay marriage, the Tea Party often reminds the establishment of where not to go in an effort to have the best possible outcome in these midterm races. These issues are often divisive and unhelpful when trying to win over crucial independent votes. There is a great opportunity for Republicans to win big this cycle and the only way to do so is to push an economic plan that reigns in spending and helps small businesses start up again. This is what the American people care about in 2010. This doesn’t mean a sacrifice of morals, but a focus on the issues that really are affecting millions of jobless Americans and many more cash-strapped families. Emphasis on other issues is for the most part a distraction that Democrats will readily grab on to and use to paint conservatives as out of touch with mainstream America.
Now that the primaries are done, the GOP needs to regain focus, get the Tea Party candidates onboard under a united economic front, or leave them to fend for themselves in their respective races. A Republican majority is no good when a good part of that majority is comprised of those that are splintering their party and hurting their own cause. The establishment is still the establishment. It needs to stop acting like the minority within the party, take charge, ignore the crazy personalities and the social agendas, and offer the message and plan that will solve America’s most pressing problem: the economy.

Harvard has hired two real estate consulting firms, Leggat McCall and McCall & Almy, to help formulate a blueprint for the University’s future development in Allston, but there remains no clear time line or concrete plan for the expansion at this point.
The two firms have been retained by the University to provide expert advice on the real estate market and large developments, according to Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
The University is currently gathering information to determine how it will proceed with plans to develop its property holdings in the neighborhood after it halted construction on the $1 billion dollar Harvard Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009.
Both firms have experience working with large real estate developments and other university expansions.
University officials have not disclosed when work on the expansion will resume or what shape plans will take. They have floated the idea that they might co-develop the property with other firms or possibly non-profits, but have emphasized in recent interviews that all options remain on the table. They have yet to present a time line for the project.
“We’re doing a thorough review and going to take however long it takes to do the job right,” said Sandy Tierney, one of the McCall & Almy consultants working on Allston development options.
According to Lapp, the Allston Work Team—the organization charged with defining Harvard’s future in Allston—have been presenting their needs to the consulting team since this summer, and the consultants have returned with development strategies. Lapp said the Allston Work Team will present some of its findings to the University by mid-2011.
As part of a broader fact-finding mission, the Work Team has been visiting other universities, including the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, San Diego, over the past year that have engaged in expansions similar to the Allston development.
In the past nine months, Allston residents have repeatedly voiced discontent over what they say is the University’s unwillingness to involve them in the planning process.
While Lapp said the firms were hired only for the purpose of aiding Harvard’s “internal consultations,” Tierney said he and his colleagues are mindful of community concerns.
“Of course the considerations of the community are a very important part of what’s been done in Allston and always will be,” he said. “In every option we’ve looked at there is a community consideration.”
The University’s expansion in Allston would have revitalized the city with a vibrant, modern cityscape, anchored by Harvard’s Science Complex. Now, all that remains of that development is a large paved-over lot adjacent to Western Ave.
In recent weeks, there has been debate in the community over the relocation of a McDonald’s from a Harvard property to a site 75 feet down Western Ave., enabling the relocation of the Charlesview apartments—a cluster of 213 low-income housing units—to proceed as part of a land-swap between the building’s board and the University.
“I feel like we’ve come to the end of the road, and we’ve found a Harvard McDonald’s at the end of the road,” said Brent Whelan ’73, an Allston resident.
Residents say this is the most involved Harvard has been in the community in months.
Lapp points to Work Team Co-Chair Bill Purcell’s monthly coffee hours with residents as a forum for community members to voice concerns. University officials have also in the past emphasized initiatives like the recently opened batting cages and Education Portal as part of their effort to create a vibrant community despite the construction halt.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School recently discovered a small molecule that may revolutionize the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Creutzfeldt-Jacob.
Daniel Finley, professor of cell biology, and Randy King, associate professor of cell biology, discovered that the enzyme called USP14 accelerates the buildup of damaged or misfolded proteins, which can cause cell toxicity and lead to certain neurodegenerative diseases.
USP14 removes a ubiquitin tag from proteins marked for degradation and thus prevents them from being cleared by the proteasome, which breaks down proteins, according to Byung-Hoon Lee, a postdoctoral research fellow and lead author of the paper.
“We found that the USP14 enzyme is an endogenous inhibitor for the proteasome,” Lee said. “Then we asked: how can we suppress this inhibitor to possibly enhance the proteasome function?”
Lee said that he and his colleagues screened more than 63,000 small molecules that they hypothesized might inhibit USP14. Of these, they advanced one that showed the strongest results—termed IU1—into further testing.
The researchers observed that IU1 enabled the proteasome to clear and degrade toxic proteins—like the tau protein, which is central to Alzheimer’s disease—more quickly.
“The biggest implication of this research is that it is possible to accelerate the degradation of proteins in cells,” King said. “We can enhance cell survival or cell behavior if we can enable the cell to dispose of these proteins more quickly.”
Lee said that the USP14 inhibitor molecule, IU1, is a promising drug candidate because it effectively activates the proteasome and is relatively stable in the cell.
The researchers may collaborate with biotechnology companies to perform in-vivo tests of IU1. They also hope to modify the molecule to see if modifications might improve its potency or stability, according to Lee.
The findings were published early Sept. in Nature.

To celebrate the launch of their new doctoral program in education leadership, the Harvard Graduate School of Education held a ceremony yesterday in honor of the first class of 25 students accepted in the program.
The ceremony featured a student panel during which three members of the inaugural class spoke about their experiences prompting them to apply for the graduate program.
Billed as the first of its kind, the tuition-free Doctorate in Education Leadership Program was envisioned by Ed School Dean Kathleen McCartney when she was serving as acting dean in 2005.
The first new degree program the Ed School has offered in 75 years, the Ed.L.D. Program is taught by faculty from the Ed School, Harvard Business School, and Harvard Kennedy School, and combines an interdisciplinary curriculum with real-world practice.
“Education reform will require more than simple change,” McCartney wrote in a letter about the program’s launch this fall. “It will require transformation.”
The curriculum features a practice-based approach.
Core curriculum the first year is devoted to a series of modules—including units such as family and community engagement, group relations, and remaking educational policy—that place the program’s students in leadership roles.
The second year will consist of electives from across the University. And during the third year, students will join partner organizations in year-long paid residencies and complete a “capstone project”—an alternative to the regular dissertation that an Ed.D. program would require.
The multidisciplinary approach is designed “to develop domain knowledge of the education sector, critical skills in leadership management, and an understanding of learning and teaching,” according to the pamphlet published this week describing the program.
The 25 students chosen from more than 1,000 applicants were selected for their academic rigor, experiences in leadership, and “entrepreneurial spirit.”
The average age of the students accepted in the first class is 34, and each participant on average already had about a decade of experience, according to yesterday’s panel discussion.
Diane A. Robinson, who spoke at the panel, was a corps member for Teach For America before becoming the national director of recruitment and selection for the KIPP Foundation, a network of charter schools.
Robinson said that her call to teaching came from the realization that by educating she “could have such an impact in such a short amount of time.”
Nancy B. Gutierrez, who most recently worked as a middle school principal in Calif., said during the panel discussion that she chose to enter the teaching field after realizing that change would occur first and foremost through education.
“True political action takes place in the classroom,” Gutierrez said.
David Rease Jr., who also spoke at the panel, said he was motivated to teach when he realized the insufficiency of the public education system.
“I’m hoping to leave here more informed and better prepared to impact...and transform,” Rease said.

When Kwee Boon Brandon Seah ’11 looks at a harbor or marina, what would strike the normal observer as an ordinary shore habitat represents a microbiological paradise.
At the end of his sophomore year, Seah began studying molgulid tunicates, a family of marine invertebrate animals more commonly known as “sea squirts” or “sea grapes.” Seah studies the sea squirt’s symbionts, or organisms that have beneficial relationships with each other.
He is specifically interested in a protistan named Nephromyces and bacteria that live within them. For his senior thesis, Seah will identify the evolutionary relationships of the bacterial partners and examine the genetic variability and coevolution between molgulids and Nephromyces.
“What I’m interested in is...the evolutionary history,” Seah said. “I’m studying a phenomenon called ‘codiversification.’ When a new species forms, does a symbiont evolve along with it?”
Seah’s research will offer a valuable comparative basis for studying molgulids, according to Mary Beth Saffo, Seah’s co-adviser at the Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Mass., where he conducts part of his research.
“In leading their non-textbook lives, non-model organisms [like molgulids]  stimulate fresh biological questions and force us to re-examine tidy biological theories based only on the lives of organisms in controlled laboratory cultures,” Saffo said.
Before the summer of 2009, Seah applied to an internship program at the MBL, and has been working there ever since his acceptance.
The majority of Seah’s research is done on campus in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology. He performs his on-campus research in the lab of his other co-adviser, Biology Professor Colleen Cavanaugh. For his work, Seah amplified the genes of interest and sent them to be sequenced last summer in a process that he considers “a lot of trial and error.”
Seah said that he designs primers, which are short pieces of DNA flanking  the gene or  gene fragment that he wishes to amplify, from species taken from local museums, the Maine shore, and even common harbors around Mass.
Seah said that he hopes to find enough species to reconstruct a “family tree” of the molgulid tunicates and its symbionts, which will allow him to tell a convincing story as to whether codiversification occurs in these organisms.
“Research is open ended—there are always new questions as you go,” Seah said. “But I hope we will know enough so that whatever student works on this next can address the functional purposes [of my research]. That way we can start looking into the functional biology and how things actually work.”
The aspiring scientist plans to continue his work in a graduate program involving microbiology and marine biology.
“My dream is someday to go off the coast of Chile to dredge up this huge [Molgula],” Seah said. “This is a giant one, and I’ve never seen a specimen of it. I’m attracted to where the mysteries are, and the least we know about the natural world is living in the ocean.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 3, 2010
An earlier version of the Oct. 1 news article "Lab Rat: Kwee Boon Brandon Seah ’11" incorrectly stated that Seah designs gene sequences. In fact, he designs primers, which are short pieces of DNA flanking the gene or gene fragment that he wishes to amplify.

Upping the ante in the ongoing debate over the Reserve Officer Training Corps’ status at Harvard, Mass. Sen. Scott P. Brown posted a petition on his campaign web site yesterday encouraging constituents to speak out against Harvard’s ban of the program.
“Tell Drew Gilpin Faust ... that it’s time to accept [ROTC] on campus,” the post read.
ROTC “is an honorable service to the United States of America,” the petition stated, adding that “all students wishing to serve in ROTC should be allowed to exercise their service” on the University’s campus.
Brown’s petition comes one week after the Republican senator posted a web statement condemning Harvard’s policy, which denies official status to ROTC due to the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which the University considers discriminatory. “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” bars openly gay Americans from serving in the military.
Faust recently said she would consider allowing ROTC to return to campus if the policy were repealed.
Brown, a Lt. Colonel in the Army National Guard, began criticizing the University last week after Faust hinted the policy’s repeal would allow the University to grant the program official recognition.
Faust made the comment a day after the U.S. Senate declined to consider a measure that would have repealed the policy.
“It is incomprehensible to me that Harvard does not allow ROTC to use its facilities, but welcomes students who are in this country illegally,” Brown said last week in response to Faust’s comment that the policy’s repeal would have allowed ROTC to return.
Asked to comment on the petition launched by Brown, University spokesman John D. Longbrake reiterated Faust’s support of Harvard students who participate in ROTC at MIT in terms similar to those used last week.
“President Faust is deeply grateful to them for their service to our country,” he wrote. “We are hopeful that bipartisan support for the repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ will soon make it possible for every Harvard student interested in military service to serve their country.”
Last week, Faust invited a ROTC color guard to appear with her in pregame ceremonies at Fenway Park, and she has made a point of attending ROTC commissioning ceremonies.
While ROTC cadets at Harvard have in the past encouraged the University to grant them official recognition, Air Force ROTC cadet Isaiah T. Peterson ’12 said that the organization was not responsible for Brown’s petition.
In his original statement last week, Brown contrasted the University’s support for the DREAM Act—which Brown says offers “amnesty” to undocumented students—with its stance against ROTC, saying, “Harvard has its priorities upside down.”
The University expelled ROTC over four decades ago amid widespread discontent over the Vietnam war, a decision that has been maintained because of the view that the law unfairly discriminates against homosexuals.
A representative from Brown’s office did not return requests for comment yesterday.

Four panelists at yesterday’s Harvard Law School Dean’s Forum agreed that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” should be repealed, denouncing the policy as “inhumane.”
The panel, moderated by Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, covered the past, present, and future of the policy banning openly gay service members.
Aaron Tax, the legal director of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Fund, began the discussion with a brief history of DADT.
“It went from a ban based on status to a ban based on conduct,” he said.
Currently, the policy bans military members from giving any statement at anytime about being gay, performing homosexual acts and marrying (or attempting to marry) a partner. Although changes to the policy, such as making it more difficult for outside sources to out someone for being gay, have been implemented, Tax said he believes the policy is still “inhumane.”
Tobias B. Wolff, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania then explained the moral implications of the policy, stating that it forces members of the military and their families to compromise their integrity in order to serve.
Although the Law School was unable to find a member of the armed forces to present an opposing view, the panelists debated what constituted the underlying issue about the policy.
“It’s a congressional policy at issue, not military,” Minow said.
Wolff and Elizabeth Hillman, a professor at UC Hastings College of Law, disagreed, arguing it was a military issue because the military started to influence the congressional agenda.
Currently, a working group is gathering information on military reactions to a possible repeal.
According to Hillman, if the policy is repealed, complete regulation would depend on whether leaders of armed forces would believe this repeal increases military efficiency.
“I say this because that is what’s happened with every other sub-group in the military,” she said.
The discussion ended with R. Clarke Cooper, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, describing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” as a national threat because it increases the risk of blackmailing members while costing tax payers thousands of dollars per discharge.
“We all want this policy repealed,” he said.
“It will happen. The daybreak is coming,” Hillman added.

The Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Court will donate $1 million to fund a fellowship for students from the United Arab Emirates to study at Harvard Kennedy School, school officials announced yesterday.
The fellowship is a part of the Kennedy School’s Middle East Initiative, a co-curricular program that provides services such as public education about the region and executive education programs.
Students with work experience in the Abu Dhabi government are eligible for the fellowship if they have shown excellence in public service and demonstrated a will to return to Abu Dhabi after receiving their degree.
“This important grant will permit deserving students from the UAE to study at the Kennedy School, thereby strengthening our ability to build a larger and more ambitious Middle East program in the years ahead,” Kennedy School professor and chair of the Middle East Initiative R. Nicholas Burns said in a statement.
The fellowship program will provide a maximum of three students with the opportunity to study at the Kennedy School.
There are currently no students from the UAE enrolled at the School, according to Director of the Middle East Initiative, Hilary Rantisi.
“The Middle East Initiative is the interface between the Kennedy School and the Middle East region,” Rantisi said.
Fellows will have the opportunity to earn a Master’s Degree in Public Administration through the Edward S. Mason Program.
Former graduates of the Mason Program include the President of Mexico, Felipe Calderón, and the President of Liberia, Ellen J. Sirleaf along with many other world leaders, according to Doug Gavel, a spokesman for the Kennedy School.
“Understanding the culture, achievements, and policy challenges of different countries and regions is an essential quality of effective leadership, so it is imperative that the Kennedy School experience include the broadest possible representation of students from around the world,” Gavel wrote in an e-mail.
The new Abu Dhabi Fellowship joins the Turkish Secretariat General for European Affairs Fellowship in allowing dedicated public servants from foreign countries to study as members of the Mason Program.
The School’s development office, along with several alumni, has been working for more than a year to work out the details of the arrangement, according to Rantisi.

Harvard Law School administrators modified the wording of its grading policy following student concern about a recent change that attached numerical values to the Pass-Fail system, according to the student body president.
Dean’s Scholar Prizes—awarded by professors for academic excellence in a course—were described on student transcripts as equivalent to five points on the grading scale. The explanation has been reworded to state that Dean’s Scholar prizes are worth an extra point in addition to the four points awarded for an honors grade, according to Law School Student Government President Jennifer D. Dein.
The wording will not affect how grades are calculated, but has assuaged fears among students that a Dean’s Scholar Prize would be regarded as equivalent to an “A.”
The wording adjustment was made after the Law School student government sent a letter to Law School Dean Martha L. Minow last week expressing concerns about a recent change to the grading policy that introduced point values to the high-pass system. Four points are awarded for a High Pass, three for Pass, two for Low Pass, and 0 for a failing grade.
The changes—which were intended to make Latin Honors calculations more precise—were implemented over the summer but were never publicly announced.
After many students voiced concerns that the new point system would devalue Passing grades, Dein said she decided to draft a letter on behalf of the student body.
“Many students were under the impression that the official grade change (to H, P, and LP) was intended to take some of the pressure off of grades,” the letter to Dean Minow stated.
“However, with the new method of determining Latin honors, it encourages both employers and students to view the Dean’s Scholar as an A, an H as a B, a P as a C; and an LP as a D,” it continued.
Though the latest wording change was never announced, it was disclosed to Dein earlier this week.
Harvard Law School spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment yesterday.
The adjustment “definitely is an improvement,” Dein said. “It helps in emphasizing that students are being evaluated with Hs, Ps, and LPs, and a Dean’s Scholar is a special achievement.”
Dein said she still hopes the administration will address students’ other worries about grades.
The letter also cited student concern that employers will use the system to make direct numerical comparisons of students’ transcripts.
“If the numbers are primarily for the school to determine Latin Honors, there does not seem to be a reason for the employers to have the information at their fingertips,” the letter said.
“While they do not expect the school to hold a forum each time the administration changes a policy, many students would like some sort of communication in advance of such changes. In the absence of prior notice, some students may get the mistaken impression that the school is hiding something from its students,” it continued.

Harvard’s research and aid initiatives in Pakistan have grown in relevance after unprecedented flooding in Aug. devastated the country’s infrastructure and affected more than 20 million people.
The flooding of the Indus River system, which resulted from heavy monsoon rains, presented immediate challenges. Millions of people needed water, shelter, and food, and battled the onslaught of hypothermia, cholera, and viral diarrhea, according to Jennifer Leaning ’68, director of the François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights. Most significantly, they faced long-term difficulties with resettlement.
“The very enormous longer-term work is when people go ‘home.’ We have not seen this number of people uprooted since the partition of India,” Leaning said. “It’s close to an impossible task.”
In response to these challenges, the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative—co-founded by Leaning—is assessing the diverse needs of the Pakistani population through research projects to direct future efforts by the international humanitarian community.
Through the Harvard Water Security Initiative, led by Environmental Engineering Professor John Briscoe, Harvard researchers are collaborating with Lahore University of Management Sciences, the Pakistani government, and the country’s private sector to improve the water infrastructure.
“Management of water of the basin is what enables almost 200 million people to now live in the basin,” Briscoe wrote in an e-mail. “That said, you can never interfere with such a massive system without giving rise to another set of challenges.”
Oceanic History Professor Sugata Bose emphasized the complexity of water issues in Pakistan. Water scarcity had been an issue when he visited LUMS in May, but now the country is faced with “too much water” and may face a drought next year, Bose said.
He added that water distribution is also a source of political tension between Pakistan and India, where the source of the Indus River system is located.
“Not oil but water will determine our future in terms of development as well as the choice of peace or conflict on the subcontinent,” he said.
The Asia Center will be sponsoring on Oct. 14 a cross-disciplinary panel on the floods, in which scholars will speak about their perspectives on potential solutions to the catastrophe.
The Harvard Pakistan Student Group has planned multiple events over the coming months to keep the floods on the minds of students. HPSG is trying to build a database of students interested in Pakistan and hopes to get 5,000 students to donate $1 toward flood relief by the end of the academic year.
“Instead of making our campaign about raising money, we are making our campaign about raising engagement with students at Harvard,” said HPSG President Mariam Chughtai, a student at the Graduate School of Education.

National Humanities Center President and Director Geoffrey G. Harpham spoke about the evolution of humanities in America to a crowded Thompson Room in the Barker Center yesterday.
Alongside Sissela Bok, a visiting fellow of the Harvard School of Public Health and the wife of former University President Derek C. Bok, and Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Humanities Center at Harvard, Harpham described the unique American incarnation of the humanities.
Bok said various cultures interpret the humanities in different ways, noting that the plurality of the word “humanities” reflects the multidimensionality of this area of study.
Speaking in a quiet, raspy voice, Harpham said the American view of humanities emerged in the United States after World War II. Harpham said that the humanities led to the development of a sense of elitism in America preceding the Cold War and the Space Race, when totalitarianism was seen as a force to be fought.
At the time of its development, the American manifestation of the humanities involved the development of liberal education, the possession of a unique moral compass, and pride in American democracy.
Harpham also said Harvard played a fundamental role during this time of intellectual change. Former Harvard President James Bryant Conant’s “General Education in a Free Society”—one of the first books published on humanities education following the end of World War II—was among the first texts to emphasize the need for humanities education programs in public schools and colleges throughout the United States.
In addition to polarizing the field of humanities for years to come, the book also helped strengthen America’s perception of its place in the world.
In fact, it seemed that Harvard dominated most of Harpham’s discussion, and he even joked at one point that the title of the event should be changed to “How Harvard Invented the Humanities.”
Harpham said in an interview after the event that he hopes to continue working closely with Harvard and other institutions to redefine the humanities. Recently, Harpham has organized collaborations between humanities scholars and scientists to answer some of the most important questions in the humanities, such as what it means to be human.

A team of Harvard astrophysicists designed a set of scientific instruments that will directly sample the sun’s atmosphere for the first time as part of  NASA’s Solar Probe Plus mission to the star in 2018.
The Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons Investigation received a grant of $67 million from NASA on Sept. 2, and will use the money to design and build the proposed instruments, according to a press release.
As the SPP spacecraft hurtles toward the sun, the SWEAP Investigation will sample atoms and electrons in the gases of the corona, the sun’s outermost atmosphere. The instrument acts as a “thermometer that measures the plasma we encounter in the solar atmosphere,” said SWEAP Principal Investigator Justin C. Kasper, who is also an astronomy lecturer.
Before the SPP mission became a reality, the corona had been long considered too hot for a spacecraft to penetrate. But a unique carbon-composite plate shielding the delicate instruments from direct sunlight will allow the shuttle to travel within 4 million miles of the Sun. At this distance, the Sun will appear 20 times wider and radiate 500 times brighter than it does to an observer on Earth, according to the release.
At this close proximity, the SWEAP Investigation offers astrophysicists a more accurate glimpse of the Sun’s atmosphere than has ever been possible before, according to Kasper.
He added that no previous instrument has been able to measure the movement of waves at the high frequency that SWEAP can record. SWEAP is also the first instrument of its kind designed to operate at temperatures of 1,400 to 1,600 degrees Celsius, according to Kasper.
He said that he hopes the instruments will “definitively determine the mechanism that heats the corona and accelerates the solar wind to high speeds.”
Kasper said that he had been planning the SWEAP Investigation for 10 years, and that a variation of SPP was first proposed 50 years ago, before NASA was even established. The head of that earlier committee was Professor John Simpson, Kasper’s undergraduate adviser at the University of Chicago, who encouraged Kasper to “carry the torch” to make the mission happen.
NASA first seriously considered the Solar Probe mission in 2000, but did not go forward with the project at the time because it lacked the adequate technology to design the instruments and spacecraft.
NASA renewed the project five years ago. Kasper created a team of 60 scientists from Harvard and seven other American institutions, who have since been working together to make SWEAP technologically feasible.
Astronomy Professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb said he recognizes the importance of SWEAP: “If we understand the Sun better, we will perhaps be able to get a better understanding of other astrophysical systems,” he said.
He also expects SWEAP to help scientist forecast the effects of the Sun on the earth more accurately than ever before.
As SWEAP goes into its development stage, Kasper is optimistic about the work ahead.
“I would have been happy to do this near Earth, but it’s even more fun near the Sun,” he said.

Starting this semester, undergraduates and some graduate students will be required to tentatively declare their course schedules for the following semester months before shopping period begins.
Seniors, who have the earliest deadline, will be required to submit their course plan for the spring semester by Nov. 3. Juniors must declare their tentative schedules by Nov. 10, and freshmen and sophomores will turn in their course plans the following week.
The course plan is not binding and are meant to offer College administrators guidance in hiring teaching fellows, assigning classrooms, and ordering course materials before the semester begins.
“It’s not registration. You’re not in a class,” said Stephanie H. Kenen, associate dean of undergraduate education. “It’s information for planning purposes. We’re not giving faculty the names of the students.”
Given recent expansion of the General Education curriculum, College administrators have experienced difficulty in predicting course enrollment numbers, and the College has had to hire teaching fellows at the last minute and coordinate room changes after classes have already begun over the past semesters.
For example, Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding 26: Gender and Performance, which had an enrollment of 24 students in fall 2007, jumped to an enrollment of over 200 when the course officially became part of the Gen Ed curriculum in fall 2009.
“Pre-term planning might not have indicated all of that. There’s a certain viral thing that happens during shopping period,” Kenen said. “But if we’d known 100 people were interested, that would have woken us up.”
Unplanned hires cost the College an additional $1 million last year, according to an estimate by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris made last spring.
Finding additional teaching fellows at the last minute may have affected teaching quality as well in previous years, Kenen said, pointing to Q Guide data showing that TFs and teaching assistants hired after the start of the term received scores that were “lower in a statistically significant way” than those hired earlier.
The policy change, which administrators said was a pedagogically sound idea, means students must plan ahead to submit their course schedules.
“Your educational plan should be an ongoing conversation in your head,” Kenen said. “Not set in stone, not pre-determined, but your whole eight semesters here should be an organic whole.”
Last year administrators required sophomores to fill out a plan of study online, in which they listed courses they planned on taking for each of the remaining semesters.
Courses selected in the plan of study can be easily inserted into the pre-planning tool.
Incoming freshmen will have an opportunity to consult with their academic advisers before they are requried to select courses.
First- and second-year graduate students will also be required to fill out the form. Their deadline will be Dec. 2, according to the Pre-Planning website, which is located at http://ptp.fas.harvard.edu.
Students who do not complete the tool in time will be fined, according to Kenen.
Two students said that since the pre-planning tool was non-binding, they did not have strong objections to the proposal.
“I can see their point,” said Meredith A. MacGregor ’11.
But, she said, “It’s kind of hard to pin down classes before you actually shop all of them.”

The Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced last week the creation of a new research institute focused on computational science to enhance graduate study in the field.
The Institute of Applied Computational Science, which is directed by Physics Professor Efthimios Kaxiras, seeks to provide students the tools and training necessary to succeed in the field of computational science, an increasingly important part of science and engineering research.
SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray, Kaxiras, and others involved in the Institute hope to eventually expand the initiative into a full-fledged degree in computational sciences. Such a development may take several years to occur, Kaxiras said, but he hopes that the more immediate changes will generate positive results.
“We have several ideas that will hopefully bear fruit in the next few months,” Kaxiras said. “We hope that even by next spring there will be a number of new courses which we hope will be exciting to the students and help start the progression.”
Kaxiras said he created a special task force consisting of faculty hailing from a variety of fields—including applied mathematics and computer science—to help develop curricular materials in the applied computational sciences.
Though it is too early to pinpoint specific course selections, Kaxiras said he believes that future classes may focus on computational projects. For instance, a class may involve the use of computational science to study the motion of fluids, perhaps culminating in a project that models the progression of oil spills at sea.
Kaxiras said that he and his team also aim to bolster current graduate course offerings by including more computational components.
The advances being made at the graduate level may well trickle down to undergraduates, according to Michael P. Brenner, professor of applied mathematics and applied physics.
“The hope is that, although this is a graduate initiative, it will have an indirect impact on undergraduate education,” Brenner said. “If we plan this right, then it will provide [undergraduates] opportunities to take more advanced computational classes at the graduate level.”
Kaxiras and his team also plan to invite experts from outside of Harvard to serve as faculty and advisers within the new Institute. The influx of new talent, combined with the interdisciplinary nature of the applied computational sciences, would ideally facilitate partnerships among faculty members from different academic backgrounds, Kaxiras said.

Since its establishment in 2007, Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences has vastly increased its undergraduate population, with a 37 percent rise in undergraduate concentrators in the past three years.
In the wake of the economic recession, on the heels of the newly announced reduced endowment payout, and with an eye to future faculty retirements, the school hopes to maintain instruction quality in undergraduate classes by hiring a cadre of non-ladder faculty while it continues to search for tenure-track professors.
These non-ladder faculty include both graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, each with a unique term-limit and focus within the school, but collectively geared toward developing curriculum and easing undergraduate advising issues.
While SEAS follows the same hiring procedures as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, administrators say that the school is still playing “catch-up” to FAS’ instructional infrastructure.
“There always needed to be additional course advising and design and focus in SEAS,” Associate Dean for Administration and Academic Affairs Edward Kleifgen says. “I think that this was something that SEAS, and its predecessor DEAS [The Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences], has been thinking about for some time.”
The importance of undergraduate courses, Kleifgan adds, has always been a priority for SEAS, regardless of the school’s financial health.
“We have to keep up the teaching, irrespective of the budget,” he says.
SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray has sought to have SEAS grow into a larger hub in the University, a dream that already is becoming realized: one in nine students in the current freshman class intends to concentrate in engineering.
As the school continues its initiative to make each focus in its Engineering Sciences concentration into its own concentration—following the successful transition of Biomedical Engineering to a full-fledged concentration this year—the need for instructors is increasing.
The school hopes to hire the necessary number of non-tenure track faculty members to maintain its target 6-1 student-to-faculty ratio.
“Where we have lots of students, I’m going to input preceptors,” Murray says. “We need to build up the teaching infrastructure.”
Murray and the rest of the SEAS administration are currently actively recruiting to complement their ongoing faculty searches with preceptors to serve as support.
“We are starting to look into these positions more proactively, because we have to,” Kleifgen says. “We need these non-ladder faculty to ensure that our teaching can stay consistent through this expansion and to buffer when faculty retire.”
Computer Science Area Dean Michael D. Mitzenmacher said that he hopes to see the CS Area student-to-faculty ratio continue to fall below that of other concentrations at Harvard.
“We tend to be looking for people across the board,” Mitzenmacher says. “In CS, we have lots of needs, and lots of holes that can be filled.”
Applied Mathematics, another field that is growing rapidly, is earmarked for gaining more preceptors, as is Environmental Sciences.
“They [the preceptors] aren’t necessarily replacements for the faculty,” says Kleifgen, who emphasizes that ongoing faculty searches are still taking place.
But these non-tenure track faculty are no less qualified in their abilities to teach, according to Environmental Engineering Area Dean Steven C. Wofsy.
As equally capable instructors, non-ladder faculty will serve the growing undergraduate population at SEAS.
And while this undergraduate expansion may have increased SEAS’ presence in the University, it has also pushed the school to efficiently allocate its resources.
“We must grow,” Murray says, “without growing apart.”

Spare Change News—a street newspaper started by homeless individuals that is circulated in Cambridge and Boston—will expand its circulation area to Worcester starting Oct. 8.
David J. Jefferson, executive director of Spare Change News, said the move was spearheaded by Robert Flanagan, a community organizer for the Worcester Homeless Action Committee, and Spare Change News.
The publication’s Worcester edition, which is slated to be printed monthly, will feature a 1,000-issue circulation in its first printing.
Jefferson said the Worcester edition will first be shipped to Cambridge from its press in Long Island City before he personally drives the newspaper to Worcester.
“In the future, we might develop a more sophisticated system,” Jefferson said.
In Cambridge, the newspaper’s vendors—who comprise people who have found “it difficult to obtain more conventional work due to myriad types of adversity,” according to Spare Change News’ website—buy each issue for 25 cents and sell it for one dollar, pocketing the difference. Though the sale price of an issue will remain the same in Worcester, the vendor system may differ from its Cambridge counterpart.
The biweekly Cambridge edition of Spare Change News is paid for through paper sales to vendors, In contrast, the first issue of the Worcester edition has been paid for primarily through advertisements.
How the paper is sold in Worcester will be contingent on that city’s urban landscape, Jefferson said.
“City planning in Worcester is quite different from the model we have in Boston and Cambridge,” he said, adding that vendors in Worcester will be able to sell Spare Change News “at corners of busy intersections when people in cars can give them money,” as opposed to in front of stores or on busy sidewalks, as is the case in Cambridge and Boston.
The Worcester edition will include four pages of content devoted to local news. But some of its content will overlap with that of the Cambridge and Boston edition, including next week’s cover story—an exclusive interview with Mass. Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78.
Several writers for both editions are either homeless or formerly homeless. They are often motivated by telling their own stories—from articles on access to health care to stories on drug addiction—said Adam J. Sennott, editor in chief of Spare Change News.
“They’re on the front lines of what they’re writing about.” Sennott added.
Jefferson said he hopes the magazine will continue to grow—though without forgetting its roots.
“The [Spare Change News] board and I would like to see the paper cover more geographic territory, including the North and South Shores,” he said. “But at the same time, we don’t want to forget our heart here in Cambridge.”

Harvard Medical School researchers have outlined a more efficient, safer way to reprogram adult stem cells, a development that holds strong implications for the field and patient care.
Using human skin cells, researchers have discovered a new way to turn these cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that are nearly identical in quality to human embryonic stem cells. Previously, iPS cells were produced by the injection of a virus, which could adversely modify the cell’s genetic makeup.
The study, which was released yesterday, describes a more effective procedure for turning a human cell into an iPS cell, thereby increasing the availability of these potentially life-saving cells.
The study builds on the research of Japanese physician Shinya Yamanaka, who first turned adult human cells into iPS cells in 2006. These cells can be programmed to grow into a myriad of other cells, giving researchers the potential to construct human organs out of them.
Because the new method can produce higher quality iPS cells up to 100 times more efficiently, researchers say they hope it can be used for patient-specific treatments.
According to Medical School professor Derrick J. Rossi, one of the study’s authors and HSCI principle faculty member, organs could be constructed from a patient’s own cell, which would avoid the problem of a patient’s body rejecting a donated organ transplant, which it recognizes as a foreign object.
Scientists had previously used Yamanaka’s method, which utilizes viruses to make the cell pluripotent. But the Harvard Stem Cell Institute plans to switch to the new method, which substitutes mRNA for viruses.
Unlike viruses, mRNA avoids altering a cell’s genetic makeup during its transformation into a pluripotent stem cell that can morph into any type of body tissue.
Medical School Professor and HSCI co-director Doug Melton said on a conference call with reporters earlier this week that the cells created by this new process have an identical molecular signature to that of human embryonic stem cells.
Still, human embryonic stem cells remain the “gold standard,” according to Melton, who co-chairs the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology.
Harvard has been a pioneer in human embryonic stem cell research, but federal funding for that effort has been in flux after a federal court judge recently struck down government funding for this type of research.
The study’s new method skirts political controversy as it does not involve the use and destruction of human embryos.
The Harvard Stem Cell Initiative will use the new method to create iPS to researchers requesting them, according to Melton.

Harvard researchers have created a molecule that can block an important element of the on-off switch in cancer genes, potentially opening a new front in cancer research.
The study, published recently in Nature online, is the first to report a successful inhibitor of bromodomains—a family of “reader” proteins that sit on the folded DNA and send signals to activate DNA replication.
Since cancer is caused by uncontrollable cell growth and division, targeting bromodomain readers can turn off the gene pathway, prevent DNA from making copies, and potentially arrest the growth of the cancerous cell, according to researchers at Harvard-affiliate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
“We’re using this molecule as a tool to manipulate the gene regulation pathway to find a cure for cancer,” said Jun Qi, one of the lead researchers.
The findings detail the structure and function of the new molecule, which the scientists dubbed JQ1, after Qi.
The new molecule has shown great promise in targeting BRD4, a bromodomain-containing molecule that plays a key role in initiating DNA transcription. The development will advance the search for a cure for a deadly and currently untreatable type of cancer called nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma.
The results “underscore the broad utility and immediate therapeutic potential of a direct-acting inhibitor of human bromodomain proteins,” according to the paper.
Now that JQ1 has shown potential in arresting cancerous cell growth in mice and in-vitro experiments, the researchers are eager to move forward and test it in human clinical trials.
“Unfortunately, the last patient that we got cell lines from was in the last stage of cancer, so we [were not] able to do anything for him. But in the future, we hope to use the compound we’ve made to save lives,” Qi said.
According to Dipanjan Chowdhury, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at Harvard Medical School, the study draws light to a “relatively new theme in cancer research.”
“The big thing right now in cancer research is personalized medicine, as we move away from broad pharmaceutical treatments,” Chowdhury said. “This work is about finding molecules that selectively affect new players in cancer biology, and it definitely moves research in that direction.”
Researchers at Dana-Farber collaborated with researchers from four other institutes including Oxford University, Harvard-affiliate Children’s Hospital Boston, Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the University of Notre Dame.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following student opposition to College plans to close four House dining halls during Columbus Day weekend, the College administration announced that all undergraduate student dining halls will remain open throughout the holiday.
The decision came after “a number of students” told College staff they intended to stay on campus during the weekend, according to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal.
The College announced the change in an e-mail sent to students via House administrators.
Originally, Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services had planned to close dining halls in Currier, Dunster, Kirkland, and Winthrop Houses during Columbus Day weekend “in an effort to be fiscally responsible at a time of continued financial constraints,” according to an e-mail sent by HUHDS spokeswoman Crista Martin.
Several students criticized the anticipated closures, arguing they would cut the gross pay of dining hall employees and pose an inconvenience to undergraduates.
In an e-mail to The Crimson, Neal said the College received no formal complaint from the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.
No new dining hall closures are expected this year, he added.
Students also questioned the transparency of HUHDS’ decision-making process, citing the dining service’s failure to send a public announcement to the student body.
HUHDS had posted the closures on its online calendar.
In Currier House, about 180 students signed a petition urging HUHDS to reverse its initial decision.
One of the petitioners, Currier House Committee secretary Amy Rosenthal ’11, said HUHDS’ reversal was “obviously the right decision.”
“In terms of the loss of salary to the workers, it [would have been] terrible, and in terms of the inconvenience to the students, I don’t think they [HUHDS] had thought everything through because people will be on campus and they will want to eat,” Rosenthal said.
Following HUHDS’ reversal, Dunster House Committee social chair Annemette H. Harnes ’12 said she found it “nice to know that the administration is actually listening to students.”

Legalizing drugs in the U.S. could save the federal government $88 billion, according to Harvard economics lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron.
The findings, published by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, show that legalizing drugs would save the federal government an estimated $41.3 billion in drug prohibition enforcement expenses.
Legalizing drugs—including marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and synthetic drugs—would also generate tax revenues of about $46.7 billion, Miron argued in the paper, which he co-wrote with Katherine Waldock, a doctoral candidate at the NYU Stern School of Business.
Miron, also a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said he did not think the proposal to legalize drugs would lead to higher demand, because current drug laws are mild and ineffective in deterring drug use.
“In most cases if you are charged with simple possession, you don’t get arrested, you pay a fine of $100 dollars,” Miron said.
The paper proposes that tax revenue would come from regular income, sales, and a sin tax. The proposed sin tax would discourage irresponsible drug use but punish responsible use, Miron said.
He compared the sin tax on drugs to a tax on Ben & Jerry’s ice cream.
“Some people misuse Ben & Jerry’s,” Miron said. “They eat too much, get fat, and use publicly funded health care.”
Miron argued that a black market for drugs would not emerge if drugs were taxed at a rate comparable to alcohol or tobacco.
While Miron said he does not expect his report to change existing drug laws, he said he hoped his findings would plant the idea of legalizing drugs.
“People who already believe drugs are evil won’t be swayed,” he said. “The numbers might change the minds of a few people who are on the fence.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Naked men and women, wearing only silver paint and their undergarments, stormed the stage in a sold-out Sanders Theater last night, as audience members exploded in laughter and the winners of the twentieth annual Ig Nobel Awards presented their research—which ranged from using toy helicopters to study the mucus of whales to relieving physical pain by cursing.
The awards, which parody the Nobel Prizes and honor 10 groups of scientists who present their ground-breaking scientific research in a comical way, were presented by a panel of actual Nobel Prize winners.
The Management award was presented to a group from the University of Catania in Italy for its research demonstrating mathematically how organizations would become more efficient if they promoted their employees randomly as opposed to by merit. Their research was acknowledged by the New York Times as one of the most “noteworthy notions of 2009.”
Two awards were particularly timely. The Economics prize was awarded to the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, AIG, Lehman Brothers, and other financial institutions for pioneering and proliferating new ways of investing money that “maximize financial gain and minimize financial risk for the world economy.” The Chemistry prize was awarded to Eric Adams, Scott A. Socolofsky, Stephen M. Masutani, and British Petroleum for “disproving the old belief that oil and water don’t mix.”
The Physics prize was awarded to Lianne Parkin and her team from the University of Otago in New Zealand for demonstrating that people slip and fall on icy footpaths less often if they wear socks on the outside of their shoes.
The group said they developed the idea after noticing people sliding down a street in their neighborhood that the Guinness Book of World Records had identified as the steepest street in the world.
“As public health academics, we naturally felt compelled to hold a randomized, controlled trial,” said Parkin. “We did a lot of laughing and some thinking during our research.”
The evening’s festivities were centered around the theme of bacteria, and featured a mini-opera dedicated to germs that inhabit the mouth and a musical interlude about bacteria by the band Evelyn Evelyn.
The new winners will join past titleholders for an afternoon of lectures—which are also open to the public—at MIT on Saturday.
Attendees said they were thoroughly entertained by the evening’s shenanigans.
“I’ve been 19 out of 20 times,” said Kathryn Kunkel, an administrator for the Committee on the Study of Religion. “It’s nice to have tradition, but the show gets better and better.”
Julia Walker and her husband travelled from Western Connecticut to watch the show for their 49th anniversary.
“It was hyperbacterial!” Walker said. “We have been sharing our bacteria for 49 years now.”
Master of ceremonies Marc Abrahams, the editor of “Annals of Improbable Research,” which organizes the show, closed the presentation with a few choice words.
“If you didn’t win an Ig Nobel Prize this year—but especially if you did—better luck next year,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors, graduate student fellows, and other experts gathered last night for an interdisciplinary discussion of sexual violence in 1945 Berlin.
Harvard Law School doctoral candidate Heidi C. Matthews, who organized and moderated the panel, said the impetus for the discussion came from her visit to Germany the summer of 2009, during which she discovered a resurgence of interest in the matters of World War II among the grandchildren of the victims.
Matthews said she hoped the discussion would bring to light that German women were both perpetrators of “crimes against humanity” as well as victims of crimes—namely rape—near the end of the war.
Experts featured in the panel discussion included Law School professor Janet Halley, Cooper Union professor Atina Grossman, German psychiatrist Philipp Kuwert, and historian Wendy Lower. They covered topics ranging from feminist principles in governance and the long-term effects of rape trauma.
Each approached from their own fields the concept of sexual violence, persecution, and trauma in the context of 1945 Berlin.
“Persecution, when it’s a crime against humanity, must not only be persecuted due to race, ethnicity, or creed, but also gender,” said Halley, who presented on feminist law reform in international law, especially pertaining to “crimes against humanity,” such as rape.
“As an aspiring scholar of international law, I was troubled by the way law makes distinctions with real, final, and lasting judgments,” Matthews said. “Those who were judged as guilty were labeled as only such. The Berlin [1945] example provides a discreet moment of what it means to speak of rape.”
Last night’s discussion began with a screening of Max Färberböck’s “A Woman in Berlin,” which was based on a book of the same title written by an anonymous German woman in the spring of 1945. The film illustrated the sexual abuse endured by German woman during the last few months of World War II, providing background for the ensuing discussion.
“[The film] sheds light on the deep complexities of sexual violence and sexual contact during times of conflict,” said Lisa M. Kelly, a doctoral candidate at the Law School.
Kuwert echoed the idea of retrospection.
“My generation,” said Kuwert, who is a native German, “is the first generation that can finally look at the past and try to understand what happened.”
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTIONS: October 3, 2010
An earlier version of the Oct. 1 news article "Panel Explores Sexual Violence in 1945 Berlin" incorrectly stated that panel moderator Heidi C. Matthews visited  Germany this past summer. In fact, she visited the summer of 2009.
The same article's title incorrectly stated that the panel discussed sexual violence in "Nazi Germany." In fact, the panel focused on sexual violence perpetrated by allied forces at the end of the war.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 11:49 P.M. 
Robert H. Giles, who has spent the last 10 years as curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, will retire at the end of the academic year.
Giles, whose career in print journalism spanned more than 50 years, served as a mentor to the members of the Nieman Fellowship Program—a mid-career, year-long program at the Foundation that invites at least 12 domestic and 12 international journalists each year.
“Under Bob’s leadership, the Nieman Foundation has responded effectively to a rapidly changing media landscape by creating new programs that helped fellows and other practicing journalists understand their changing roles,” said University Provost Steven E. Hyman in a released statement.
Under Giles, the Nieman Foundation started the Nieman Journalism Lab to gauge how journalism can survive in the age of the Internet. Two years since its launch, the site has received more than 2.4 million page views.
“I will miss the opportunity to help lead the Foundation in a way that continues to make it a vital resource for journalists everywhere—not just the Fellows—who use our website,” Giles said.
Reflecting on his time at Harvard, Giles said that he will miss the “intellectual spirit” of the University and the “openness that is such a character quality of Harvard.”
“The most important thing about the Nieman Foundation is what Harvard is able to offer the fellows,” Giles added. “It’s the opportunity to learn. I
believe that journalists need to continue to learn about the very complicated subjects that they are reporting on.”
Giles, 77, said he is in good health and was able to set the terms of his retirement with the University.
According to a press release, Hyman will lead the search for a new Nieman curator.
Upon leaving his post, Giles said he will likely do what most Nieman Fellows do—“take courses at Harvard, go to lectures and concerts, read.”
He also said his future will continue to involve journalism.
“I’m a journalist in my soul, and I hope that I’m not through with journalism,” Giles said. “I hope that there will be some opportunities for me to stay connected with journalism through the coming years.”
This July, Giles spoke out on behalf of an incoming Nieman Fellow who was denied a visa to study in the United States.
The issue garnered the attention of national media, and with the support of the Foundation and several journalism organizations throughout the country, the Nieman Fellow—Colombian investigative journalist Hollman Morris Rincon—was able to secure a visa for entry and participate in the 2010-2011 Nieman class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow at 12:00 p.m Harvard will attempt to recover from its first loss of the season when it face the Lafayette Leopards in Easton, Penn.
Last Saturday the Crimson (1-1, 0-1 Ivy) lost its Ivy League opener, 29-14, to the Brown Bears (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) during Brown’s first ever under-the-lights game in Providence, R.I. The Crimson struggled to combat the Bear’s defense, finishing the game with -16 net rushing yards, four fumbles, and two interceptions.
“If you look at the number one thing that we didn’t do well, it’s that we put our defense on the field with their back to the wall on the one-yard line, and three times on a very short field,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Another one of the Crimson’s biggest challenges in the team’s game against the Bears was its offensive line. Senior quarterback Andrew Hatch struggled to find open receivers, and Brown’s defense managed to quash the majority of Harvard’s offensive drives.
“If you struggled to run the football, you put yourself in a lot of situations where it makes it harder to throw,” Murphy said. “They did a great job, they’ve got a very aggressive, very athletic defense, and they didn’t make it easy for us at all.”
“First of all we need to get rid of mistakes that are preventable,” captain Collin Zych said. “We didn’t execute that way we wanted to and if we don’t, we can’t win football games. W can’t play like we did in the Brown game where we weren’t able to bounce back quick enough before things got out of hand.”
If Harvard expects to do better this weekend, it must cure its offensive woes and settle a score with the Leopards. Last year the Crimson was defeated by Lafayette (0-3), 35-18. This win was a landmark for the Leopards as their first victory against Harvard in nine years.
“We’ve got to eliminate mistakes in all phases, and it’s as simple as that,” Murphy said. “If we do those things, we’ll be in the hunt right until the end.”
Lafayette has had its own struggles to start the season and heads into the game with three losses behind it. The games have been extremely close with the Leopards losing by less than a touchdown in each. During the squad’s game against University of Pennsylvania, Lafayette held the lead heading into the fourth quarter, but during the sixth minute, Penn scored a touchdown to take the game.
Lafayette dropped its most recent contest in double overtime against Princeton, making tomorrow’s game the Leopards’ third straight against an Ivy League opponent.
“[Princeton and Penn] are clearly two of the top teams in our league right now, so this is a very good football team, so they’re going to be hungry, they’re going to be desperate,” Murphy said.
The game against the Tigers was not only a nail-biter, but also a milestone performance for Lafayette senior place kicker, Davis Rodriguez. Rodriguez made four out of four field goals at Princeton from 27, 21, 35, and 26 yards. His performance earned him the title of the Patriot League’s Special Teams Player of the Week. This is the first time in 20 years that a place kicker on the Leopards’ team has made four field goals.
Both teams have been the victim of recent injuries. Lafayette freshman Pat Mputu was the starting tailback against Princeton because the Leopards’ regular starting tailback, Jerome Rudolph, was sidelined last week. During Harvard’s game against Brown, Crimson starting offensive lineman Brent Osborne was taken off the field with an apparent ankle injury. Murphy seemed confident, though, that Osborne would be ready for tomorrow’s game.
And Harvard will need as many healthy starters as possible against a Lafayette team that presents a tough matchup.
“They give you a lot of challenges,” said Murphy of the Leopards. “They give you a lot of conflicts, they really mesh their run game and their pass game, their play-action pass really well. They’ve got a lot of really good athletes. [Their quarterback] spreads the field, and distributes the ball to a lot of different people.”
With Lafayette’s offense primed for a strong game, its Harvard counterpart must get back on track if the Crimson hopes to leave Easton with a winning record.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a team has only seven league games, there is little margin for error. After dropping its first Ivy League match against Penn last Friday, the Harvard’s women’s soccer team finds itself in a do-or-die position. One more league loss could all but spell the end of the Crimson’s hopes for a third-straight Ivy League crown.
The fact that Harvard’s next league opponent is Yale makes it all the more dramatic.
“It’s more than just an Ivy League game,” said co-captain and midfielder Gina Wideroff. “It’s Harvard-Yale. We train so hard for this competition, for this kind of game. And on top of that…having lost to Penn, this is a really important game for us.”
The Crimson (3-4-1, 0-1-0 Ivy League) will face the Bulldogs (3-5-1, 0-1-0 Ivy League) on Friday at Ohiri Field. The match marks the 35th meeting between the two teams, with Harvard having won 26 times.
Like the Crimson, Yale finds itself in need of an Ivy League victory after dropping its first contest to Princeton, 1-0.
“It’s an Ivy League game that we both obviously desperately want to win,” Bulldogs coach Rudy Meredith said. “The magnitude that it’s [against] Harvard and the magnitude that it’s an Ivy League game this early in the year [after] we’ve both come off Ivy League losses—I think that ramps up the magnitude of the game a bit.”
Unlike his Yale counterpart, Harvard coach Ray Leone does not want to focus on the long-term ramifications of the Friday game.
“I think it’s a mistake for us to think that far ahead,” Leone said. “We just need to think about this game. I know everybody’s talking about it, and I don’t, and I want my team not to talk about it. It’s game number two.”
Game number one did not go the Crimson’s way. Harvard’s 4-3 loss to the University of Pennsylvania on Sept. 24 marked only its third Ivy League defeat in three years. The Crimson had two leads in the game, but in both instances the team could only hold the advantage for less than ten minutes. After Harvard grabbed a 1-0 advantage at the 12-minute mark, the Quakers answered with a goal of their own only 73 seconds later.
“We need to start the game off stronger and be more consistent throughout the entire game,” Wideroff said.
Down 3-2 at the half, the Crimson fought back scoring the equalizer in the 59th minute. Nevertheless, Penn’s goal 12 minutes later proved to be the deciding score.
“I don’t think we necessarily played that poorly,” junior forward Melanie Baskind said. “I think we were a little bit flat coming out.”
Harvard rebounded in its next contest against the University of Massachusetts Amherst that Sunday.  Learning from its slow start against the Quakers, the team rattled off two goals in the first 15 minutes holding on against the Minutewomen to prevail by a score of 3-2.
In both games over the weekend, the Crimson had no trouble on the attack, as was especially the case for Baskind, who scored two of the team’s three goals against the Quakers and found the back of the net again versus the University of Massachusetts. For her play, she was named the Ivy League Player of the Week.
“[Baskind] was great,” Wideroff said. “She scored some great goals, and she’s really leading the attack up there, so it’s great that she’s on top of her game right now and she’s playing well with our other frontrunners and our midfielders.”
Baskind is not the only dominant force on the offensive side of the ball. Senior captain and forward Katherine Sheeleigh, who Meredith referred to as “the best attacking player in the league,”   poses another legitimate threat to opposing defenses. Her four goals are the second-most on the team.
Together, Sheeleigh and Baskind have formed a formidable duo on offense. Against Penn, both of Baskind’s goals came on assists from Sheeleigh. The women traded places versus the Minutewomen, with Baskind setting up a Sheeleigh goal.
“It’s a lot of fun to play with [Sheeleigh],” Baskind said. “I think we’ve got a couple of years of experience under our belts now and it’s a connection that’s been formed – it’s exciting.  I feel like I know where she’s going to be when I pick my head up.”
Harvard will count on the duo, which has scored nine of the team’s 13 goals, as it continues league play.
Despite the bleak outlook for a third Ivy League Championship in as many years, the Crimson has found itself in a similar position before. After losing its first league game to Penn in 2008, Harvard went undefeated the rest of the season against teams from the Ancient Eight, eventually winning the league crown.
To follow the path of the 2008 squad, the Crimson cannot afford another loss, especially this early in the season. For Harvard, Friday’s contest with the Bulldogs is a must-win.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the start to the Ivy League season quickly approaching, players and coaches will undoubtedly take time to reflect on what’s been happening so far.
The Harvard men’s soccer team (2-3-3) looks to bounce back from its first loss at home as it takes on Ancient Eight rival Yale (1-7-1) in the Ivy League opener tomorrow at Ohiri Field. After a six-game winless streak, with three losses and three draws, the Crimson hopes to return to form and recapture some of that on-field chemistry that helped them beat then-No. 13 Stanford in the season-opener, 2-1.
Last year’s matchup against the Bulldogs was anything but friendly. The hard-fought match ended in double overtime in favor of the Crimson after sophomore Brian Rogers scored the winning goal in the 103rd minute.
In the past three seasons, Harvard has won every match against the Bulldogs with the Crimson backline recording shutouts in each game. But players like senior forward Alex Chi are also well aware of this match’s potential to ensnare the home side.
“We can’t take games against lesser teams like Yale too lightly,” Chi said. “We need to win games that we are supposed to win, but battle in the games where we aren’t.”
In Harvard’s last outing on Wednesday, Providence defeated the men’s soccer team, 2-1. The Crimson trailed the Friars, 2-0, at the half, but within the first minutes of the second period, a well-coordinated offensive attack by Harvard and a shot on goal by junior midfielder Jaime Rees cut the deficit in half.  Though the Crimson outshot the Friars 18-8, the Harvard offense could not find the back of the net to gain the equalizer.
“It was one of those games where we completely dominated,” Chi said. “And [Providence] literally had only two chances, but they put those two chances away. And we left the game wondering how we were just robbed of a win.”
After a strong start to the season with wins against Stanford and UMass, the Crimson has been winless ever since, conceding eight goals in the last six games.
But this has not been a major letdown to Harvard men’s soccer coach Carl Junot due to the high level of competition the team has been up against.
“It’s been an interesting season for us so far in a sense,” Junot said, “because we’ve played three of the very best teams in the country, being UConn, UC Santa Barbara, and New Mexico. I think that those are legitimately some of the top 15, top 20 teams in the country and our performance against those teams was fantastic.”
Nevertheless, the Crimson’s weakness on the defensive side of the ball has raised some tactical questions leading up to Ivy League play.
“I think our focus for this week,” Junot said, “is to really work on tightening up our defense. I believe we have the most talented attacking team in all the Ivy League, and that we can create enough opportunities to win every game. The question is, are we going to be solid enough defensively to not concede goals? If we can shut-out teams or keep them to one goal, I think that we are going to have a chance to win every Ivy game.”
Besides its significance as the Ivy League opener, the 97th meeting between Harvard and Yale also holds additional meaning for some on the Crimson side. For Junot and the five seniors on the squad, tomorrow’s game signifies a crucial moment in their collegiate soccer careers.
As a first-year head coach, Junot remarked on the importance of the match against the Bulldogs at a personal level.
“[The match against Yale] does have special significance for me,” Junot said. “Its my first Ivy League game as head coach and I want to get a positive result and I want our team to have the pace to victory, because I feel that our team is on the verge of having a very good season.”
And the seniors hope that tomorrow’s game will be a memorable final Harvard-Yale matchup.
“Harvard-Yale is always a tough rivalry game, Chi said. “But Yale is one of the few teams that I’ve beaten every time, so I would like to close out my time here 4-0 against them.”

Looking for a cool alternative to the usual Sunday-morning college routine of hangovers, homework, and “veritaffles?” This weekend you have a great one. On Oct. 3, you can join Radcliffe crew in Boston’s first ever Jog for Jill, a 5k walk/run in memory of Jill Costello.
As many of you may have heard from this Crimson column last week Jill was a non-smoker and coxswain on the Cal rowing team who lost her battle against lung cancer this past June. She dedicated herself to raising money for cancer research in the last year of her life and, just months before passing away, led her team to a second-place finish at the NCAA Championships. The first Jog for Jill took place in San Francisco two weeks ago and raised over $350,000 for the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation.
The Boston-area Jog for Jill event to benefit lung cancer research will kick off this Sunday at Artesani Park in Brighton, MA.  Registration begins at 7:30 a.m. and the “jogging” itself kicks off at 9, but the event promises to be a full morning filled with fun and exercise, while of course promoting lung cancer awareness and raising money for the cause.
Members of Radcliffe crew will be participating in some way or another this weekend. So far, the heavyweight and lightweight teams have combined to raise $11,716 for the BJALCF, more than doubling their initial donation goal. Many Radcliffe rowers and other Crimson athletes also plan to participate in the run itself this Sunday. Check this out for more details, especially if you want to get involved either through donation, as a runner, or both.
