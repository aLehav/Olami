Bug
Loeb Ex
Directed by Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13
Produced by Senan Ebrahim ’12, Aaron S. Graham-Horowitz ’15, and John L. Pulice ’15
Paranoia, insanity, and love are all par for the course in “Bug,” which opened at the Loeb Ex last Friday as part of Harvard-Radcliffe Summer Theater 2012. Written by Tracy Letts—who won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for “August: Osage County,”—“Bug” centers on the relationship between cocktail waitress Agnes (Ella G. Gibson ’15) and war veteran Peter (Teis D. Jorgensen ’14), a personal connection that quickly deteriorates due to Peter's mental illness and Agnes's personal problems.
“What interests me is the idea of choosing something insane,” says director Sarah M. Batista-Pereira ’13.  “Peter’s probably suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and Agnes has had a stressful life.”
However, Agnes and Peter are not the only disturbed individuals in the play. The psychiatrist Dr. Sweet (Joey J. Kim ’15) is obsessed with his patient Peter, and this dynamic also has a crucial impact on the show. “He’s a very interesting character in that he cares about Peter so much that he’ll manipulate anyone,” Kim says. “There’s a scene where he talks to Peter’s new lover and he is using everything to manipulate this girl.”
The tension created by the machinations of the characters is heightened by the play’s sparse set. According to Batista-Pereira, the show’s inherent voyeurism will be amplified by the fact that the action is observed through a false window.  However, this also adds a layer of detachment.
“I didn’t want the audience to get trapped in the paranoia,” Batista-Pereira explained.  “I wanted them to observe from a distance.”

It seems Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All’s Tyler, the Creator is attempting to amass as many creative roles as his rap collective’s name has words. Most recently, he is serving as the director for the music video of “Sam (Is Dead).” Written by Tyler and Domo Genesis, the song is part of “The OF Tape Vol. 2,” although the music video was presented by Tyler as “A Film by Wolf Haley” (one of his aliases). Tyler has taken to Twitter in his excitement over his directorial debut, tweeting, “BY 25 I DO NOT WANT TO BE RAPPING. LEGIT JUST MAKING FILMS AND SCORING THEM. SAM.”
The video features Genesis, Lee Spielman of Trash Talk, Manface, Lionel "L-Boy"Boyce, Brick Stowell, and Lucas Vercetti as soldiers in the Vietnam War. Tyler’s directorial debut doesn’t fail to deliver on the surreal and grisly atmosphere fanshave come to expect from his work: the video includes a scene with Tyler in fullmilitary dress executing three Tyler doppelgangers with his trademark graphict-shirts and Supreme snapbacks. With fresh bullet holes in their heads, the three Tylers then deliver the last lines of the track as their executioner looks on with satisfaction.
With Tyler’s ever-expanding repertoire and diversifying oeuvre of work, it’s growing harder and harder for any critics to deny that he has a bright (and odd) future ahead of him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 4, 2012, at 10:10 a.m.
Harvard has appointed Vanidy “Van” Bailey as the College’s first permanent director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer student life. Bailey, the assistant director for education at the University of California, San Diego, will assume the new position on July 16.
Last April, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced her intention to hire a full-time staffer dedicated to serving the BGLTQ community on campus.
In a statement to students, Hammonds said that the decision was based on recommendations made by the BGLTQ Working Group, which she created in October 2010 to evaluate BGLTQ experiences and needs at the College.
In an email, Bailey expressed excitement for connecting with BGLTQ students and staff at Harvard and said that the first task for the new director would be setting goals for the upcoming academic year.
At UCSD, Bailey oversees programs at the BGLTQ Resource Center and advises student organizations.
In September 2011, the College announced that Lisa “Lee” Forest of Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts would be its first director of BGLTQ student life. However, one month later, Forest turned down the position at Harvard for “personal and professional reasons.”
During the search for a new director, Emily J. Miller, a student at the Divinity School, served as interim coordinator. She oversaw the opening of the College’s first Office of BGLTQ Student Life, in Boylston Hall, in March.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: July 3
An earlier version of this article used the pronoun "she" to refer to Vanidy "Van" Bailey, the newly appointed director of bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer student life. In fact, Bailey prefers not to be referred to by any gendered pronoun.

A new book by Sean O'Rourke '49 explores the histories of a slew of restaurants in and around Harvard Square. Many of the restaurants, like the Border Cafe, Bartley's Burgers, and Algiers are favorites among undergraduates and tourists today.
But others have long since closed their doors, and "A Brief History of Harvard Eateries and Watering Holes" recalls memories of the somewhat forgotten restaurants of the past.
Electronic editions of the book, which was released in November of 2011, will be given away for free on amazon.com on July 4. They can be downloaded for Kindle, as well as for various Kindle applications for iPods, iPads, computers, and smartphones.

Soon, students logging onto their my.harvard accounts won't be greeted with the recognizable gray boxes of the old website. Instead, they'll see another familiar sight: a photograph of Harvard Yard, one of the central components of Eva Stojchevka's winning entry in the my.harvard redesign contest. Stojchevska, a rising sophomore, will receive a $200 prize for her work.
"I was obviously thrilled to hear that I had won, especially because the way the design was picked was through a general Harvard vote," Stojchevska said.
Stojchevska said that she was inspired to enter the contest so that she could both give back to Harvard and bring the website up to date. "Harvard is at the cutting-edge on various other fronts, so I felt like the design of the primary webpage for members of the Harvard community should be no exception," Stojchevska explained. According to my.harvard, the new design will be implemented by mid-August.
