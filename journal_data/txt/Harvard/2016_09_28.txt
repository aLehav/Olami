After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I sat in the dimly lit room of the Loeb Center and glanced around at the shadowy faces of my peers, a litany of prestigious high schools whizzed past my ears: “Andover! Choate! Hotchkiss! Dalton! Trinity!” I sat there nervously awaiting my turn to announce my alma mater. But when the spotlight was finally mine and all eyes were on me, I stared at the ground and mumbled: “I went to school in Brooklyn, New York.”
I raised my eyes off of the ground and was greeted by a wave of unsettled eyes. I knew this was a sign that everyone wanted more. It wasn’t enough to tell them the city that I came from; they wanted to know the “path” that I took to get to Harvard. So, I tried again—except that I prefaced my statement by saying “you’ve probably never heard of it, but…” And then, painstakingly, the words poured out of my mouth: “I attended Medgar Evers College Prep.”
Many of the freshmen who drove through Johnston Gate on Aug. 23 did not look like me, talk like me, or attend schools like mine. Many wore Sperry's and salmon shorts and went to prep schools, while I wore ripped jeans and Nike slides—characteristic of my upbringing in New York City. Immediately, I was stricken with fear, as I realized how inferior my public school was to the secondary schools that my peers attended.
I came from a predominantly African American school where resources were very scarce and only 76 percent of students graduated from high school and enrolled in college within six months. The public school system in New York City is so segregated in the sense that two public schools in the same borough could have very different access to textbooks and facilities based on the demographics of its students. Because of this, I was literally the third person in my school’s 23-year history to get into Harvard.
My school never had opportunities for kids to be artistic or do anything other than academics. So it was no surprise to me that when I auditioned for the play, "Songs of the Harlem River," I wasn’t called back. I was at a point where I felt confined to the few friends that I knew and never spoke to others. I kept quiet, even during conversations about topics that I held dear to my heart. I was lost, and I was afraid to ask for help in fear of what others would think of me.
My voice was gone.
I was doing Harvard completely wrong. No one should ever come to Harvard feeling like they do not have a voice. Sure, competing against students who are arguably the best in the world can be intimidating, but to swallow your tongue is unforgivable. Everyone has talent, whether that be dancing, singing, writing, being a leader, or being a spokesperson—it’s just a matter of finding that talent. There are students here who have gone to amazing schools and know how to manage life at Harvard well, but that doesn’t make it impossible for those who did not attend said schools to do the same.
I had to remember who I was. My name is Ethan Ambrose and I’m from Brooklyn, New York, born of a single St. Lucian mother. I did attend public school for the last 16 years of my life, and I should not have been ashamed of that. I needed to realize that there are spaces for me to thrive on Harvard’s campus. I could have joined Harvard’s Caribbean Club, or perhaps Harvard’s Black Men’s Forum. I realized that I just had to start off doing things that made me comfortable. With that realization, my voice returned to me, and now I intend to write for The Crimson to talk about the issues that affect kids like me—and how that impacts our overall performance at Harvard.
I took a very lonely route in search of my voice, but I believe that anyone who is in my position or may end up there should remember the things that got them to Harvard in the first place. Remember your family, your friends, and the people rooting for you back home—and most importantly, remember that your admissions officers did not make a mistake. They could have filled the class of 2020 with only students from prep schools, but they also chose you. That means that your experiences and perspectives are useful and add to the color of the class. That is where you will find your voice and when you do find it, do not relinquish it.
That is the only way you can survive at Harvard.

I wish grieving was like math. Wrong or right, you’d still get to some sort of answer, perhaps without ever knowing how you arrived at it. The word problems would look something like this:
If you cry for a day, eat irregularly for a week, and sleep till the lines between day and night become indistinguishable, how long does grief last?
Or this:
Person X has 15 chocolates. They exchange 5 in return for your sadness. How many chocolates do they have left? How much sad remains in you? I could solve the first part almost instantly. The latter is what gives me the most trouble.
In economics, we often use the term "ceteris paribus," to describe causal relationships. Literally translated as "with other things being the same," the term allows us to study the cause and effect relationship between two variables by assuming that all other relevant factors remain constant. It has never made sense to me even, though economic theory swears by it. How can you isolate any thing when everything is a tapestry weaved with threads of different factors?
On some subconscious level, I think I wanted to apply the ceteris paribus law to my life at home when I first came to school; I wanted all things to remain the same there so that they would be familiar whenever I returned.
For many of us at college, home is not a short bus ride away. For some, it’s no longer even in the same time zone. For me, home is a 17-hour flight away, and that’s before I factor in the hours of layovers in strange airports. Between my home and my school, there are 10 hours of time difference, and the closest I can come to breaching the physical space between the two is by a phone call or FaceTime.
And even so, there are times when home feels completely inaccessible.
When I was home over break, I scribbled this down somewhere: “Leaving is harder than pulling your nails out.” Watching your grandmother wither away as your flight itinerary sits in your room is, to say the least, uncomfortable, and contemplating whether or not you’ll be able to see her again is a permanent backpack of guilt on your shoulders. At times like this, getting on a plane can be hard. But you still do it, because you somehow have to. And the regret that follows is permanently stamped in your passport. And, somehow, at this point, your decision to board a plane is bound in shackles of self-imposed blame. When you find out later—over the phone, of course—that you are a grandparent less, the only one left to console you is your grief cloaked in anger.
It’s different for everyone. Maybe you never thought you’d be homesick and thought you hated your family. Maybe they were your best friends and you did everything together, and every time your sibling posts a picture of them eating at your favorite restaurant, a thread of belonging unwinds itself in your chest and floats away. Suddenly, you have a little less of them and they have none of you. Maybe that hurts a little. Or just surprises you. You never thought nostalgia was going to be a problem for you. Homesickness: you were never one to carry diseases. But it suddenly weighs you down.
When you miss a birthday.
When you lose a grandparent.
The reason I never cared much for the idea of "ceteris paribus" or constants is not only because I deemed the idea impractical and obsolete, but because I believe that the only constant we have is change. But, change can still be unsettling, no matter how hard you prepare for it. It doesn’t matter if you spend all of winter break at the side of your grandparent thinking this may be the last time you see them. It still hits you left, right, and center.
Apparently, there are five stages of grief, but that information would only be helpful to me if I knew where to start. I believe there is some truth in saying there is no right place to start. It varies from person to person. Similarly, there isn’t any formula you can use to rid yourself of homesickness. It shrinks and grows in size, but it never really goes away. It stays with you as long as you stay away.
But, what do you do with these sentiments? I wish I knew. But, I have figured out what not to do with it. I’ve realized not to use ceteris paribus; isolating these feelings doesn’t make them disappear. Instead, acknowledging them can be the right foot forward. Every time we face either grief or homesickness, it is perceived as something you get over; a transient place. Fearing that it might be a little more permanent than that can be scary. But, I’m here to tell you it doesn’t always have to be transitional.
Stay there—whatever “there” is for you—for as long as you want. And when you feel like moving on from this place, know that you are capable of that as well. Being sad is okay. Not being sad is just as okay. Being homesick is okay. Grieving is okay. Especially when it’s a long way home.

Harvard faces numerous pressing issues: a suboptimal social scene, growing competition from other universities for talent, and critical challenges to diversity and inclusion. Unfortunately, last week brought another, this time in the form of a renewed challenge to the endowment’s stable growth. Specifically, Harvard Management Company announced a $2 billion loss for fiscal year 2016. 
Let’s not mince words: this is unacceptable.
Over the past several years, Harvard’s endowment returns have failed to keep pace with peer schools’ returns. In fiscal year 2015, Harvard ranked penultimate among Ivy League institutions, with Princeton besting Harvard Management Company by nearly seven points. At the time, University President Drew G. Faust referred to these poor results as “concern[ing]." This year’s loss is only the culmination of this underperformance since the financial crisis.
As crass as it might be to say, money makes Harvard go round. We are a nonprofit institution of higher learning, but educating young people is expensive. Paying professors is expensive; maintaining dorms is expensive; funding research is expensive. As we stated this spring, 35 percent of the University budget is funded by the endowment. Far from a pot of gold in the sky, the endowment and its performance have tangible effects on University life and activities. The financial crisis and consequent portfolio losses demonstrated that much. Students—and administrators—would do well to recognize that reality.
We’re glad that Harvard has chosen not to cut budgets in the wake of this most recent loss, and we are cognizant of the fact that current-use gifts and tuition may help to bridge this small (in percentage terms) loss. However, when fundraising priorities like House renewal are already behind schedule—and the administration is voluntarily drawing funds from the endowment to operate the University—the returns produced by HMC are ever more critical.
Indeed, endowment underperformance outweighs the potential benefits of fundraising. As we opined in 2015, major gifts are dwarfed by potential investment gains in a portfolio as massive as Harvard’s. A one percent rise in returns equates to about $350 million—approximately the size of the gift that renamed the School of Public Health. This year’s losses of $2 billion amount to five separate gifts the size of the one that renamed the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. If those numbers are large enough to rename a school, it’s clear the administration must move fast to rectify a problem with financial consequences multiple times larger.
We don’t mean, however, to disregard the role of development. The Harvard Campaign is important for the University’s future, and as we said when it was launched, the resources it seeks will have an important role in charting Harvard’s role in the 21st century. Yet the inescapable corollary is that a failure to steward those gains will make the entire exercise less valuable. Former University President Lawrence Summers told The Crimson last year: “The quality of the endowment's performance, far more than fundraising, will determine whether Harvard remains preeminent.” We couldn’t agree more.
We also recognize that we are not investment advisors. College students have no business telling seasoned analysts and managers where to invest the endowment. Instead, we wish to urge the administration to prioritize endowment performance before Harvard falls further behind peer institutions.
We don’t know whether the answer lies in increased compensation at HMC, a different asset mix, or a more fundamental strategic rethink. But we hope to underline the importance of this problem in the minds of President Faust and the Corporation. If indeed the Harvard Campaign is infused, as Faust writes, with “the urgency of the present and the promise of the future,” so too should be her efforts to set the endowment on a solid footing for the future.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush will join the Kennedy School of Government as a visiting fellow in the Program on Education Policy and Governance this fall, according to a Tuesday announcement. Bush, a favorite of Harvard's undergraduate conservatives, campaigned for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination before suspending his campaign in February.
Bush will bring his experience as chairman of the Foundation for Excellence in Education to the Kennedy School fellowship. The foundation strives to “build an American education system that equips every child to achieve his or her God-given potential,” according to its website.
According to a Kennedy School press release, Bush will make several multi-day visits to Harvard over the course of the fall semester. During those visits, he will serve as a guest lecturer in the course, “The Political Economy of the School,” which is co-taught by Government professor Paul E. Peterson and Louisiana State Superintendent of Education John White, who is also a visitor to the Program on Education Policy and Governance this fall.
The press release also said Bush would participate in study groups, the Program’s fall colloquia, and the Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum, which consists of a series of public lectures addressing important issues in education.
In addition to his fellowship this semester, Bush will deliver the annual Edwin L. Godkin lecture at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Thursday. According to the press release, Bush’s talk will focus on challenges to economic and social mobility in the United States and will be co-moderated by Peterson and Economics professor Roland G. Fryer.

Students said they welcome local resolutions passed last week that mandate the distribution of bike safety information to all new Cambridge residents, including incoming Harvard students.
According to a trio of resolutions passed by the City Council last week, the Cambridge City Manager’s office will work with local universities to disseminate information about bike laws and safety to all new residents.
The legislation comes after the death of Amanda N. Phillips ’10, who was killed in a cycling accident in Inman Square in June. Dozens of residents expressed concern about the biking environment in Cambridge at a City Council meeting following the accident.
James M. Johnston ’17 was supportive of the legislation but said its effect would largely be dependent on how the information was disseminated. 
“It depends how they’re going to spread that information, how they’re going to distribute it, and what they’re going to do with it,” Johnston said. “It’s good to release it all, but it’s what you do with it and how you let people know.”
Another student, Sophie O. Pesek ’20, said the new regulations could be particularly helpful for students who come from less urban areas.
“It’s not going to be unhelpful. It’s not going to make anyone less safe,” Pesek said. “Some people might not be familiar with biking in cities if they grew up in a rural place, so that information might be good for them.”
Other students echoed Pesek in agreeing that providing information could only be beneficial.
“I feel like most bike safety stuff is pretty intuitive, but it won’t do any harm,” Robert Lowe ’20 said.
While some students like Pesek said they have felt safe biking on campus so far, a number also said they are aware of the danger posed by sharing the road with vehicles and understand the potentially grave consequences that can occur.
“The traffic patterns are confusing and drivers aren’t always looking where they’re going, so it’s easy to get hit,” Angeline N. Diana ’20 said.
Other students expressed concern about the erratic behavior of some bicycle riders.
“It’s also annoying because even if you put in bike lanes, some cyclists still hop onto the sidewalk and weave in and out of traffic and when that happens it can be dangerous,” Flora L. Dicara ’20 said.
The city’s plans to distribute the safety information have yet to be announced.

Harvard’s School of Public Health is partnering for the first time with political news organization Politico this year to conduct national polls about health and domestic policy.
The Harvard Opinion Research Program, run out of the School of Public Health, will assist Politico Pro—a subsidiary of the company that offers paid subscriptions for in-depth policy coverage on various topics—by providing academic research and historical background to better explain polling data.
Full-time workers and Ph.D. students conduct the polling on health and social policy, according to HSPH and Kennedy School professor Robert J. Blendon, who has directed the Harvard Opinion Research Program for over 20 years. The program has partnered in the past with news outlets including the Washington Post, USA Today, and the Boston Globe.
Blendon said he approached Politico this time around because he was concerned by the increasing polarization of political parties this election cycle and wanted to work with an organization focused on politics.
“It really is an effort to take more academic research and combine it with journalism so you end up with a better understanding of what’s going on in the country,” Blendon said.
Politico Pro's health care editor Joanne L. Kenen ’79, a former Crimson news editor, wrote in an email that the partnership will add “a data-driven dimension to our reporting in an incredibly exciting election year and the opening phase of the next administration.”
Blendon has advised Kenen and other Politico staffers in the past on polling.
Kenen wrote that “[Blendon] understands the intersection of health care policy and politics as well as anyone, so when he broached this idea, it took me all of about three seconds to realize it was a great opportunity for POLITICO and the policy sections at POLITICO Pro.”
The first joint poll was released last weekend and focused on trade. Blendon said his group reviewed polls dating back to 1992, when presidential candidate Ross Perot took a strong stance against free trade, and discussed their findings with the trade team at Politico.
Looking forward, Blendon—who has taught a public opinion polling course at the Kennedy School—stressed the need to ground academic research in present-day issues.
“When [professors] do surveys, we often describe issues the way we describe them to you in a classroom. But they may not be the way they’re being discussed in Congress,” Blendon said.

Iris Bohnet, a professor at the Kennedy School of Government, argued that when it comes to combating gender inequality in the workplace, it is more important to build environments that eliminate the potential interference of prejudice rather than trying to change individuals' mindsets.
Speaking at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday, Bohnet said she hopes that the greatest achievement of behavioral design will be “to liberate our minds to see talent for what it really is,” rather than reinforcing human impulses to discriminate based on appearance.
“We are used to certain patterns,” Bohnet said at her talk, which focused on building inclusive organizations. “We are used to seeing male venture capitalists. We are used to seeing female nurses. And we put people into those thoughts.”
Bohnet offered many ways to combat gender biases, and she said the starting point is to be more aware of gender-based prejudice and discrimination.
“Think about the micro-inequities that you or others might be experiencing in your community,” Bohnet said. “Only by doing so will we be able to equalize the playing field in all organizations.”
Another suggestion she made for building inclusive workplaces and organizations was implementing blind evaluations that highlight skills and obscure characteristics like race or gender.
During a question-and-answer session following the talk, some audience members asked how transgender individuals and others who identify as neither male nor female may fit into the discussion.
Chioma Onuoha ’20 said she enjoyed the event but wished it had been more inclusive of those such individuals.
“[Bohnet] focused a lot on just women and didn’t go into the intersection of genders or races,” Onuoha said. “It was still a good conversation to have.”

Panelists clashed over the ways in which Massachusetts ballot measure Question 2—a proposal that would "approve up to 12 new charter schools
or enrollment expansions in existing charter schools each year"—would impact educational funding and quality at an event at the Graduate School of Education Tuesday night.
Part of GSE’s Askwith Forum series, the event featured four panelists including a Boston city councilor and the head of the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association. Scores of people stood in line to watch the debate and many attendees were directed to an overflow room.
Education School professor Paul S. Reville moderated the debate. He said that although charter schools were founded with high goals, their legacy and impact has become controversial.
“Imagine the world of public education… if every family had access to high quality schools and the capacity to choose the school which was best suited to meet the needs of each of their children,” he said of initial hopes for charter schools. “But the devil is always in the details. How would these new charter schools be funded and governed? How would they coexist with mainstream schools?”
Panelists disagreed on the issue of charter school funding. Marc Kennen, executive director of the Massachusetts Charter Public School Association, argued that charter schools should receive state funding because they are still public.
“This is still the core of the debate today, are these schools public?” he said. “The answer to that question is yes. We are not taking money away from public education because we are public education.”
However, Tito Jackson, the Boston City Council’s education committee chairman, voiced concerns about the financial consequences the ballot measure could have on non-charter public schools.
“We are talking about taking funding away from existing schools and moving funding to schools that don’t even exist yet,” he said. “It is 12 new commonwealth charter schools each year, every year, anywhere, forever.”
The discussion also touched on issues of race and socioeconomic status in the educational system. Kennen said he believes charter school proponents advocate for students of color.
“Our goal, and who we are trying to serve, are those black and brown parents and young parents, who are trying desperately to get alternatives for their children,” he said.
Jackson, however, disagreed, and questioned charter schools’ relations with minority students.
“Are we pushing out young black and Latino students, and who are we actually keeping in [charter] schools?” he said.

As flu season nears, Harvard University Health Services has begun offering its annual flu shot clinics in the College's dining halls.
The clinics have been organized with HealthPals, a peer health education group at the College that has worked with HUHS on the dining hall clinics since 2013, according to HealthPals president Paul M. Lewis ’18.
Lewis said the group will be hosting study breaks in Houses the night before their respective flu shot clinics in order to raise awareness for the immunization drive. The clinics offer only flu shots, as opposed to nasal spray vaccines.
For this year’s flu season, the Centers for Disease Control has recommended not to use the nasal spray for flu vaccination “because of concerns about its effectiveness,” according to its website.
“Our goal would definitely be to reach herd immunity, but that’s not likely to occur because some people are resistant to get a flu shot because of religious reasons or personal reasons,” Lewis said. “We’d like to get as many students as possible a chance.”
HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira wrote in an email that HUHS nurses will hold weekly clinics at 124 Mt. Auburn St. until mid-December, in addition to the dining hall clinics.
“Harvard University Health Services (HUHS) has a responsibility to help protect the Harvard community from infectious illnesses, such as the flu,” Barreira wrote.
At least 1,600 students were immunized last year in these clinics, with more estimated to be getting their flu shots from other sources, according to Lewis.
Yael M. Saiger ’19 attended a flu shot clinic in Dunster’s dining hall last year and said she was pleased with her experience. She recommended that other students choose to take advantage of the service.
“Since we’re all in close proximity, everyone’s health affects everyone else’s health,” she said.
The flu vaccine clinics are free to anyone with a Harvard ID. Upcoming clinics will be held in Currier on Sept. 28 and in Annenberg on Sept. 29. Other houses will host clinics throughout October.

Evolutionary biologist Joseph L. Graves examined the controversial history of Louis Agassiz’s views on race and human evolution and its implications for the modern perceptions of race in America at a lecture Tuesday night.
The event, titled “Smashing Agassiz’s Boulder,” was part of the “Race, Representations, and Museums” lecture series. It was co-sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, and the departments of Anthropology and Human Evolutionary Biology, in addition to the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research.
Agassiz, an eminent biologist and geologist during the 19th century, was a professor of Zoology and Geology at Harvard. He founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology and later became dean of the Lawrence Scientific School, the predecessor to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
Graves noted that Agassiz was a proponent of polygenism, which is the theory that the human race descended from multiple origins, and believed that Europeans were racially superior to people of African descent.
Graves, who has appointments at North Carolina A&T State University and the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, said many of Agassiz’s European and American contemporaries agreed with his views, which caused polygenism to become a prevailing theory.
“In the mid-19th century, the species question was the greatest scientific problem of the age,” Graves said. “Biology was, in the main, an enterprise conducted by persons of European descent... This might have been a different study if different people had engaged in it.”
Graves described Agassiz as a “giant of the European and American science community,” and said that Agassiz’s theories on the inferiority of African peoples were used by American proponents of slavery to justify the practice.
However, according to Graves, Charles Darwin’s competing theory of evolution undermined Agassiz’s views. This led to the modern understanding that all humans have the same evolutionary lineage and that traits, such as intelligence or height, are not connected to race.
Yet, Graves argued, misunderstandings of race still permeate America. He attributed this issue to a lack of education on evolution in both American high schools and universities.
“Of all industrialized nations, America has been the most resistant to evolutionary theory,” he said. “This shows in the absence of [teaching on evolution] in the biology curriculum in a large section of our nation.”
Daniel F. Lieberman, chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology, concurred with Graves’s analysis.
"It's abundantly obvious that our society still has a really serious problem with the issue of race,” he said. “Too many people don't understand that when applied to humans, it's really a scientifically indefensible concept."

With a potential strike looming, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview Tuesday that she is “very proud” of the health benefits package that hundreds of Harvard’s dining services workers have protested.
Earlier this month, Harvard University Dining Services workers voted 97 percent in favor of striking after a months-long labor negotiations stalemate with the University, though HUDS has not yet started a strike. In negotiations, the HUDS employees are calling for higher wages and different health benefits. The two parties did not reach an agreement at the latest round of meetings on Tuesday and will meet again on Friday.
“We care a lot about the working conditions of our employees, and want to come to a fair resolution of their concerns,” Faust said. “We’ve been very proud over the years of the way we have interacted with employees on this campus and the kinds of commitments we’ve made in a variety of realms: wages, benefits, and so on, to be a really first in class employer.”
“I hope that our negotiations with the union can lead to a positive outcome for everyone,” she added.
Local 26, the union that serves the HUDS employees, has so far rejected Harvard’s proposed health care package, including the health benefit plan Harvard provides to the University’s largest union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. Faust characterized these existing health benefits as “kind of exceptional.”
“We are actually very proud of our health benefits, which are for everyone at Harvard. We include post-retirees, which is very rare,” Faust said, pointing to existing health plans at other peer employers. “One of the things we’re also very proud about at Harvard is we give full time healthcare benefits to people who do not work full time, and this is not just dining hall workers. That’s kind of exceptional.”
According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, Harvard dining services workers earn an average of $21.89 per hour, a “highly competitive” wage. The HUDS workers are calling for a $35,000 minimum salary for all workers, a 22 percent wage increase over the next five years, and different health benefits.
“The Harvard Administration has failed to address employees’ concerns regarding affordable healthcare and a sufficient yearly income,” read a Student Labor Action Movement petition circulated in support of HUDS. “HUDS workers fear that they won’t be able to see a doctor when they need one, and workers with families or chronic health concerns will struggle to make ends meet.”
Should negotiations fail, the University has a number of potential options including providing undergraduates with "rebates" for local restaurants similar to how Yale responded to a food services worker strike in 2003.
“We are working on a variety of contingency plans,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 28, 2016, at 10:40 a.m.
The near $2 billion drop in Harvard’s endowment will limit funding for University programming, a “disappointing” development that has prompted a reconsideration of Harvard Management Company’s entire investment strategy, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview Tuesday.
Last week, HMC announced that the endowment—the largest of any university in the world—had lost almost $2 billion in value, shrinking to $35.7 billion in value at the end of fiscal year 2016, down from $37.6 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015. A negative 2 percent return on Harvard’s investment portfolio combined with other financial flows, including the $1.7 billion HMC distributed to fund Harvard's over a third of the Harvard's annual budget, to result in the endowment’s drop in value.
The negative returns, significantly below HMC’s internal benchmark of 1 percent and the latest in a series of underwhelming results, will put pressure on budgets across the University. 
“Returns like this constrain our budgets, which means it constrains our ability to do all kinds of things. That is disappointing,” Faust said, citing new programs, faculty, and research funding as areas that could be adversely affected because of the endowment’s performance. Schools across the University plan their budgets with an expectation that the endowment will increase, not contract, in size every year, she added.
Faust also said she was concerned that Harvard’s investment performance has continued to lag behind that of its peers. While fiscal year 2016 was generally difficult for large institutional investors, Yale and MIT, for example, managed to return 3.4 percent and 0.8 percent on their respective investment portfolios.
“In terms of our relationship to our peers we didn't do very well. So that’s disappointing as well,” Faust said.
The consistent underperformance may lead to a new approach to investing at HMC. Traditionally, Harvard has employed a “hybrid model” of endowment investing, employing both internal and external managers to invest its funds. Now, Harvard has started to outsource more of its investments to external managers. Interim HMC CEO Robert A. Ettl wrote in his fiscal year 2016 report that HMC had placed some public equity assets, usually managed in-house, under external management.
“We’re also looking really hard at the model that HMC has followed,” Faust said. “And we are looking at that to make sure that we do what works best.”
One person with a significant role in determining “what works best” will be the fund’s next CEO, Faust said. Former HMC CEO Stephen Blyth resigned in July after only 18 months in his post; he departed for personal reasons. While Faust declined to name specific candidates under consideration for the still-vacant seat, several news outlets have named Amy C. Falls, the chief investment officer at Rockefeller University, and N.P. Narvekar, who heads Columbia’s endowment, as leading candidates.
“We want to make sure we have a really strong leader,” Faust said. “So the identification of such a person is a major part of improving performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though a day-long bargaining session between Harvard and its dining services workers Tuesday did not yield a contract settlement, HUDS has not yet announced it will strike and instead will continue negotiations with the University.
Michael Kramer, the lead negotiator for UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union that represents Harvard’s dining workers—said at an event on Sept. 16 that the union would strike if a “just settlement” was not reached by Sept. 27. At the time of his announcement, Tuesday’s bargaining session was the last meeting scheduled between the two parties.
Harvard and representatives from the union will meet for another bargaining session on Friday.
The union’s last contract with the University expired on Sept. 15, after it was extended from mid-June. Tuesday’s session marked the 16th official meeting between the two parties in the more than three-month long bargaining stalemate between the two parties. A federal mediator attended the session to facilitate the contract talks.
Both sides met at the Sheraton Commander Hotel Tuesday morning to hammer out the details of a new contract and did not finish until around 7 p.m. Though Local 26 characterized the session as unproductive, Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that the two sides made “some progress,” but noted that there is “still work to be done at the table.”
“Harvard continues to negotiate in good faith with Local 26 and we hope to reach a fair resolution that recognizes the contributions of dining hall workers while supporting the University’s core mission of teaching, learning, and research,” deLuzuriaga wrote.
Tiffany Ten Eyck, a Local 26 spokesperson, wrote in an email Tuesday evening that the union believed the negotiators did not make progress. She did not elaborate on whether HUDS will strike should the next session not result in a contract.
HUDS workers have demanded that the University offer year-round work to interested employees and that, for those employees, Harvard establish a “minimum guaranteed salary” of $35,000 annually. The majority of Harvard’s dining workers are not employed during the school’s recesses, and cannot draw unemployment benefits during those times.
“We have asked for two simple things from this great university: to maintain our health care as is, and to be able to earn at least $35,000 a year for those of us who wish to work year round,” Ten Eyck wrote. “Harvard administration continues to refuse.”
According to deLuzuriaga, the University has “put wage increases on the table and proposed modest changes to health insurance.” She did not specify what such wage increases would look like.
At the offset of the negotiations, the University offered an identical health benefits package to HUDS as that negotiated last winter by its largest union, the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers.  Another campus union, the Area Trades Council, has since agreed to enroll in the same health care plan.
Besides an altered health benefits package, workers have also called for a 22 percent wage hike over the next five years. Past contracts with the union, deLuzuriaga wrote, have been settled at around 2.5 or 3 percent annual increases.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics—a federal agency that aggregates information like average wages for occupations—from May 2015 indicates that the annual mean wage for food preparation and serving-related occupations in the Boston metropolitan area is $27,690. DeLuzuriaga wrote that HUDS workers make, on average, nearly $34,000, though representatives from Local 26 argue that the average annual wage is closer to $31,000.
Since HUDS first made public its intent to strike, students from across Harvard have rallied around the workers’ cause. A group of Medical School students released an analysis earlier this month denouncing Harvard’s health care proposal; 15 groups from Harvard’s Law School released a statement blasting the University for the negotiations, which they dubbed a class and racial “struggle”; and, at last estimates, a petition circulated by the undergraduate group the Student Labor Action Movement in support of the workers had garnered more than 2,750 signatures, according to SLAM member Farris M. Peale ’18.
A SLAM rally is scheduled for Friday afternoon and will take place in front of Massachusetts Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 28, 2016, at 7:20 p.m.
A University-wide committee of professors, staff, and alumni will begin to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment and recommend improvements, the University announced Wednesday—nearly a year after the College called for such a group’s formation.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates, University President Drew G. Faust outlined the committee’s four main areas of focus: demographics of faculty, staff, and students across the University, the “fabric of the institution” and its cultures, academic resources provided to students, and the existing diversity organizations at Harvard. While different diversity programs and initiatives already exist at individual schools across Harvard, the committee will take a University-wide approach in its charge to better the climate for people of all identities.
“For nearly 400 years, Harvard has steadily—though often painfully slowly—opened its doors, as it has welcomed groups previously excluded from its faculty, staff, and student body,” Faust wrote in a memo outlining the purpose of the committee, called the “Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging.” 
“But, as recent events both here and elsewhere have reminded us, much work remains to be done if we are to fulfill our ideals and if we are to succeed in educating leaders and scholars who can effectively contribute to a complex and too often fractured world,” Faust continued.
Danielle S. Allen, a Government professor, Archon Fung, a Kennedy School professor, and Meredith L. Weenick, vice president for campus services, will lead the committee.
Drawing its members from across Harvard’s schools, the 46-person task force includes four undergraduates: Undergraduate Council President Shaiba Rather ’17, William Oh ’18, Cameron K. Khansarinia '18, and Anshi M. Moreno Jimenez ’19. Additionally, two members of Harvard’s Board of Overseers—Kenji Yoshino ’91, a lawyer and the president of the body, and Michael M. Lynton ’82, the CEO of Sony—will serve on the task force.
In an interview Tuesday, Faust said the task force’s activities will consist largely of fact-finding meetings with groups across campus before they produce final recommendations.
“I believe that actually the process is going to be extraordinarily important, so this will have an impact even before there’s a final report as conversations take place and groups are gathered together to offer their opinions and insights,” Faust said.
Over the past few years, protests at Harvard and at schools across the country have brought race relations to the forefront of national and campus discourse. Last November, students marched in solidarity with activists pushing for racial equality at Yale and the University of Missouri; that same week, the College’s Working Group on Diversity and Inclusion released a lengthy report recommending an array of reforms regarding diversity at the school. In an email heralding the report, Faust accepted the working group’s call to form a University-wide task force that would consider similar issues.
“I wanted to understand what the particular contributions from the University-wide level could be, what are the issues that are best addressed at a University-wide level rather than a local level,” Faust said.
Beyond the College, students at the Medical School called on Faust last year to consider selecting a dean from a background underrepresented in medicine; the University ultimately selected stem cell researcher George Q. Daley ’82. And students at the Law School protested the school’s seal, which bore the crest of a former slaveholding family, eventually prompting the Harvard Corporation to retire the symbol.
Additionally, last spring Faust dedicated a plaque to the four enslaved people who lived and worked on campus in the 18th century and selected another committee to consider creating more memorials about slavery on campus. Harvard will host a conference about slavery and American universities in the spring.

DJURICIC COMMITS TO THE CRIMSON
Danilo Djuricic, a 6’8” stretch four from St. Michael’s College in Toronto, became the second member of coach Tommy Amaker’s 2017 recruiting class. Djuricic announced a verbal commitment to the Crimson on Friday afternoon at a press conference held at St. Michael’s.
In a note posted on his Twitter account following Friday’s announcement, Djuricic said, “I am incredibly grateful and excited that I will be furthering my education and my basketball career with my commitment to Harvard University!”
The decision comes less than two weeks after the high school senior visited Cambridge on Sept. 15th. The Brampton, Ontario native was also considering Ivy League foe Penn and received offers from seven schools.
Djuricic joins Mario Haskett, a 6’3” shooting guard who is considered a three-star prospect by most major recruiting outlets, in Harvard’s 2017 recruiting class. Djuricic is considered a two-star prospect lauded for his versatility and has seen his stock rise in recent months after a strong summer.
He averaged 11.4 points per game and shot 40.7 percent from three-point range in 20 games this summer while playing for CIA Bounce, a Brampton-based AAU program.
“Danilo has proven over his career to be one of the best producers in the country on both ends of the floor,” Tariq Sbiet, a national scout for North Pole Hoops, said. “He has a high level skill set and I.Q., he will stretch the floor with dead-eye shooting or banging down low with the bigs.”
Djuricic has international experience after playing for Canada’s U17 team in this summer’s FIBA U17 World Championship, which was held in Zaragoza, Spain. His squad placed fifth in a tournament, which was won by a U.S. team headlined by Harvard target Wendell Carter Jr. In seven contests, Djuricic averaged 12.6 points and 5.7 rebounds on 44.2 percent shooting from beyond the arc.
Amaker, who cannot comment on players until after they are admitted to Harvard and sign a National Letter of Intent,  is no stranger to recruiting north of the border. Laurent Rivard ’14, a Saint-Bruno, Quebec native, is the program’s all-time leader in three-pointers. Agunwa Okolie ’16 (Ajax, Ont.) and Patrick Steeves ’16 (Montreal) were key cogs on last season’s squad while junior Chris Egi (Markham, Ont.) and sophomore Corey Johnson (Ottawa) were teammates on Canada’s U19 team and figure to be focal points on this year’s Crimson team.
BAMBA, CARTER CONVERGE ON CAMBRIDGE
It just might happen. With recruiting for finance and consulting taking over campus, the Harvard men’s basketball team has brought some of its own big names to Cambridge in recent weeks.
The weekend of Sept. 17-18 saw what might be one of the most noteworthy events in recent memory for the Crimson—and none of this action was on the court. Over a two-day period,  the No. 3 recruit in the nation, Wendell Carter, Jr., made his first official visit to Cambridge.
While other high profile recruits such as Brandon Knight, Victor Oladipo, and Jabari Parker have had their names tied to Harvard in the past, Carter is among the first to demonstrate a legitimate interest in matriculating. After his weekend in Cambridge, the Atlanta native narrowed his list to just four schools: Duke, Georgia, Georgia Tech, and Harvard.
He also followed up his visit with a post on Twitter saying, “Harvard was a movie this weekend.”
Carter’s decision comes as head coach Tommy Amaker has ramped his recruiting efforts in recent years. This year’s class was ranked No. 10 in the nation according to ESPN—marking the first time an Ivy League school has cracked the top 25.
While most consider Duke to be the heavy favorite for the 6’9” power forward, many think that Harvard has a real shot. In an interview with SNY.tv, Carter discussed the possibility of coming to Harvard.
"That would really be a game changer,” Carter said. “That would be doing something that most athletes don't normally do."
Also on the Crimson’s wish list is No. 4 overall recruit Mohamed Bamba. The 6’11” center unofficially visited Harvard on September 6th, but perhaps even more interesting is the fact that Bamba and Carter are close and have discussed the possibility of playing together in college.
To add to the already highly anticipated decision, Carter’s mother, Kylia Carter, told Fox Sports, “Just wait and see because I really think…Harvard has a better shot than people think. I think Harvard has a better shot than they even think.”
Carter would be the highest ranked recruit to commit to Harvard, besting current freshman Chris Lewis, a fellow Georgian, who was ranked No. 68 in the 2016 class, per ESPN.
Carter’s decision comes as the Crimson enters the season with high hopes following a lackluster 2015-16 campaign that saw Harvard finish fourth in the Ivy League.
While the addition of Carter would bring Amaker’s recruiting success to another level, the additions of players like Haskett and Djuricic continue to separate Harvard from its Ivy League peers in recruiting circles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (4-3-1) followed up Saturday’s win against Iona with a strong result Tuesday night, outworking a scrappy Boston University side (3-3-1, 0-0-1 Patriot) in the team’s last game before the start of Ivy play.
The Crimson showed heavy early pressure, starting off high in a 4-3-3 formation. Harvard co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu, normally deployed in the midfield to orchestrate the team’s attack and keep the back line protected, started at right-back and looked comfortable in the new role.
“We’re very comfortable with adjusting to start him at right back,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “[Junior defender] Eric [Gylling] became healthy, and so it was a matter of where we could fit Eric on the field. Wheeler-Omiunu is so diverse, and I know a lot of MLS teams are very interested in him at right-back, and that’s because of his athleticism… You’d think he’d played right back his whole career.”
Harvard’s defense smothered the Terrier’s first half attack, limiting them to just one shot in the period. Senior center-backs Daniel Smith and Alex Leondis kept their line high, cutting out driven balls and minimizing space for BU’s high-powered attacking combinations.
“We defended really well,” Lehrer said. “We got good pressure to the ball and made it difficult for maybe one of the best attacking teams we’ve played all year. They have a lot of very good players, and they struggled getting forward.”
Junior Christian Sady broke the tie in the 44th minute with a chip that floated just over BU goalie Matt Gilbert’s diving effort and into the upper right corner. It was the second straight game with a goal for the winger, after he scored the game winner against Iona.
“I’m just happy when the team does well, so if I can contribute to that, then that’s good stuff,” Sady said. “I felt like the team worked hard. We knew what we had to adjust, and I thought we did it well. We sat in to try to let their backs play, and it worked well.”
The Terriers opened the second half reenergized. But the Crimson defense sustained the offensive barrage and hit their opponents on the counterattack as sloppy defending from the Terriers allowed senior forward Jake Freeman to slip past the backline and slot away a 51st minute breakaway goal to put Harvard up, 2-0.
After a foul call in the box in the 71st minute, the Terriers earned themselves a penalty kick, which forward Felix De Bona put home past a diving junior Harvard goalie Kyle Parks. The goal reinvigorated the Terriers and sent the Crimson defense scrambling, as the unit struggled to regain its first half form.
“A couple things happened,” Lehrer said. “[BU is] down by a goal, [and] they’re really pushing numbers forward at that point, and so they’re maybe going to get more chances than they normally get. The guys are committed to defending, and we know, regardless of who we play, that we can defend really well.”
Despite BU’s frantic attack, Harvard fought back. Junior Tyler Savitsky’s square pass across the face of the goal in the 87th minute found freshman Matthew Glass, who netted it to seal Harvard’s 3-1 victory.
After back-to-back wins against capable squads, the Crimson has regained momentum heading into Saturday’s Ivy opener against rival Yale. Harvard has found its stride at the dawn of the most crucial stretch of the season.
“We’re always ready for this game.” Sady said. “Our intensity was great, and we need to carry that because Ivy League games are pretty physical. If we keep working hard for each other, we’ll be good to go.”

To be honest, we all thought it would get easier with time, but it’s less than two months away from election night, and we’re still frightened every time we see Trump and Clinton take center stage at an event.
It’s hard enough getting through this election sober, so we here at Flyby thought we would lend a hand. Upperclassmen, proceed with caution, because continuing with this game for more than 15 min will probably result in permanent liver damage.
Really, the game is quite simple: take a shot (of lemonade, for all you eager freshmen) whenever one of the following happens:
Let's start with opposites. A common complaint is that while Clinton only uses cold, hard facts, Trump on the other hand refuses to use statistics, and argues based on what he believes to be his charisma (we’re gonna hold our opinion on that.) So, whenever Clinton cites another number, or Trump says “just believe me,” take a shot.
Onwards to scandals! As an employer giving an interview, you would assume that you would focus on a person’s resume, achievement, or merits, but that’s obviously not the case here. Instead, let’s focus on every controversial thing they've ever done and never talk about their actual capabilities—especially since they are applying for, arguably, the most important job in the world. So, whenever we’re reminded yet again of every email, business, sex, or Twitter scandal, empty your cups.
Still not drunk enough? Here are some throwaways:
Anytime a Republican mentions something about Reagan, finish your drink.
Every time Trump manages to insult the American people, take a shot.
When Clinton leans on Obama for support, shotgun a beer and cry a little because he’s going to be gone soon.
Feel free to add some extra rules for the next debate. Just don't get too carried away; something tells us HUHS is already pretty backed up with all the freshman binge drinking.
