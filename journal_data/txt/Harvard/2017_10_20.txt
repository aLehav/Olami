A trip to Disneyworld is every kid’s fantasy. Every day of the year, families pile into the park that radiates the magic of Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, and Tinker Bell, waiting for the happiness guaranteed by ride tickets, magic bands, premium park hotels, souvenirs, character breakfasts, and everything else that factors into the Disney experience. Underneath the façade of the Florida resort, however, is a surrounding community that struggles with poverty, addiction, and everyday life. “The Florida Project” chronicles this world.
Directed by Sean Baker, who shot his critically acclaimed last film “Tangerine” on three iPhones, and produced by A24, the studio behind “Moonlight,” “The Florida Project” follows the life of 6-year-old Moonee (Brooklynn Prince) at the Magic Castle, a motel located outside of Disneyworld. The film opens with the song “We Are Family” and cuts to a scene of Moonee and two friends competing over how far they can spit off the railing of the motel. When an occupant begins to yell at the trio, they promptly respond with their own expletives, at one point confidently calling the woman a “biatch.” Yes, not a simple “bitch,” but a full-on sassy “biatch.”
This scene sets the stage for the rest of the film, documenting the life of a young person in these ironically named motels surrounding the larger magic castle. Moonee’s mother, Hailey (Bria Vinaite), is a single parent currently out of work. To earn her rent for the week, she spends afternoons with Moonee selling perfumes to tourists. When this business turns south, Hailey is forced to put both herself and Moonee at risk. Some of the most heartbreaking scenes of this film are not Hailey’s confrontations with the hotel manager Bobby (Willem Defoe), or the violent fights in front of the motel. Rather, they are when Moonee and her friends have to share one ice cream cone or when an old, run-down neighborhood serves as their playground. While other kids spend their summers playing in parks or riding their bikes around the block, kids like Moonee are trapped in a micro-world of hardship, and they don’t even know it.
With no non-diegetic music until the very last scene, Baker relies heavily on both the script and visuals to tell the story. Bright green, orange, purple, and magenta burst out in every scene, even in some of the most poverty-stricken areas of the community. These bright colors complement the film’s surface portrayal of the innocence and amusement of youth. Yet underneath all of these light moments with Moonee and her friends are the hardships that the adults endure. This juxtaposition of light and dark demonstrates Baker’s careful touch and attention to how delicate and troubled this community is. He never forces the viewer to feel a certain way, instead relying on scenes that convey multiple meanings.
Baker also managed to make this film feel as much like a documentary as an actual dramatic portrayal. Many parts of the film are simultaneously hilarious and realistic, as when Moonee and her friends see a topless woman in the pool area and proceed to joke about her breasts. That level of authenticity is difficult to achieve, and once again Baker succeeds in showing, not telling, this story.
Much like “Moonlight,” “The Florida Project” succeeds in depicting and humanizing the lives of marginalized individuals who may have few ways of telling their story on their own. Independent movies like these are crucial to our understanding of people. “The Florida Project,” simple yet powerful, is an incredible look at a community too often neglected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Dublin, on the banks of the Liffey, I found a bookstore. I sat down by the window and picked up “A Room of One’s Own” by Virginia Woolf, parts of which I had read in high school but had since forgotten. When I first read the book, I was not yet acquainted with either Cambridge, England or its Massachusetts counterpart. This time around, Woolf’s description of “Oxbridge,” as she calls it (she never makes it clear whether she is referring to Oxford or Cambridge) hit close to home. In the opening, Woolf’s narrator considers what to say in a speech she is invited to give about “women and fiction.” Absorbed in her thoughts, she starts walking across a grass plot, but not for long:
Instantly a man’s figure rose to intercept me. Nor did I at first understand that the gesticulation of a curious-looking object, in a cut-away coat and evening shirt, were aimed at me. His face expressed horror and indignation. Instinct rather than reason came to my help; he was a Beadle; I was a woman. This was the turf; there was the path. Only the Fellows and Scholars are allowed here; the gravel is the place for me.
She is similarly turned away from the library (women need to be “accompanied by a Fellow of the College or furnished with a letter of introduction”), and finally ends up meeting a friend. Over an austere meal, they discuss the struggle to raise funds for a women’s college. The absolute best that the women were able to do, despite the bottomless endowments of other Oxbridge colleges, is to “raise bare walls out of bare earth.”
The point that “instinct rather than reason came to [the narrator’s] help” in the initial confrontation bears emphasizing. The man expressed “horror and indignation” not for any logically given reason, but because of a deeply held assumption that was not even recognized, let alone challenged, until he saw a woman on the grass. When we come to assume through our “faulty education,” in Woolf’s words, that some people do not belong in certain spaces, it becomes second nature for both the trespasser and the supposed gatekeeper to accept structures of exclusion (thus Woolf also pities “the patriarchs [and] the professors”).
In my first few years at Harvard, I became increasingly aware of the ease with which many male students would ask questions in class, while I often wrote down questions word for word and agonizingly chewed on them in my head before daring to speak. I noticed the assumed male pronouns people sometimes made about professors—“I’m taking a class with Professor So-and-so.” “Cool, what does he teach?” This wasn’t just something I observed, but a statistically valid phenomenon. An annual report noted the “progress” in faculty diversification at Harvard, as female tenure-track faculty hit a record high of 30 percent.
We must pay attention to the broader reasons why people make such assumptions: As Woolf writes, women have historically not had access to the resources necessary for their education, whether to attend existing institutions or to establish their own. When a lucky woman, or more broadly, a member of a racial minority or otherwise disadvantaged group, manages to gain entry into spaces of power, she faces resistance precisely because she is an exception. In the process of change, those moments of resistance can become frustrating, but they have the possibility of being informative: An assumption is often only brought to light when something challenges it. Even if the initial response to seeing a woman on the lawn, at the podium, or in a doctor’s coat is one of surprise, that moment leads us to face the assumptions we have. My hope is that further surprising encounters will challenge those assumptions. For the time being, I take solace in the subversive possibilities of occupying places that are not “for me.”

Harvard students tend to skip introductions. Too excited to get to the really interesting stuff—or too hard-pressed between classes and extracurriculars to get through the week’s reading—we typically move straight from front cover to chapter one, passing over the history and context in between. I had been reading “Planet Narnia: The Seven Heavens in the Imagination of C.S. Lewis” for a good two weeks—having naturally skipped the introduction—before one day, searching for my bookmark, I flipped through the preface and saw an aged yellow sticker on the opposite page:
“In Memory of Wainwright Merrill, Class of 1919. Born at Cambridge, May 26, 1898; Killed at Ypres, November 6, 1917.”
Wainwright Merrill transferred to Harvard from Dartmouth his sophomore year. That November, he left Cambridge and faked his name to enlist in the Canadian Garrison Artillery. Deployed to Europe the next year, Merrill fought as a gunman in the trenches of World War I. He was killed in Belgium, at the Battle of Ypres, four days before the fighting there ended. He was 19 years old.
That was 100 years ago. Now, Merrill’s memory lives on a dusty Widener library shelf, next to a dry introduction that a 2017 Harvard student like me couldn’t be bothered to read. Now, Harvard College seems to have lost Merrill’s spirit along with his memory.
Merrill led Dartmouth’s military battalion in the spring semester of his freshman year. The battalion—filled with passionate supporters of the Allied cause—drilled in courtyards, studied combat tactics, and dug an elaborate system of trenches next to Dartmouth’s football field. But today, Harvard students tend to hide in more trenches than we build. We so easily dive into the predetermined ruts—the most prestigious concentrations and extracurriculars to lead to the most prestigious internships and job offers—that we’re afraid to venture outside these troughs built by assumed notions of success. As Professor Mihir A. Desai has compellingly written, we’re afraid to “go for alpha,” to reach outside the secure channels we’ve come to identify with success—even if it means sacrificing the chance to pursue what we really care about.
Merrill held no such reservations. In a letter to his father, who disapproved of his enlistment in the Canadian Artillery, Merrill wrote that “he could not, in honour, stay out [of the war] even if America should take no action.” Though the U.S. would enter the fray just five months after he did, Merrill didn’t wait for anyone else to catch up to his convictions. He dropped out of college, passed over ruts of conventional success, and fought for what he believed. He refused to live in any trench besides the one he dug for himself—the one he eventually died in.
To those of us who can’t imagine achievement without a shiny Ivy League diploma or six-figure starting salary, this seems incredible. “But it's part of the game,” as Merrill wrote to a friend shortly before Ypres. “And it is a noble end which we seek out of the ruck and jetsam of death and broken men and lasting sorrow.”
What’s the noble end we’re seeking today? The closest we come to Central Powers threatening our democracy is the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging threatening our final clubs. Our idea of sacrificing for a higher cause means giving up free time for an extracurricular activity, studying on a Friday night, or squeezing an extra hour of community service into our Google Calendars (all of which looks great on a resume). We battle subpar social life, uncomfortable words, stressful schoolwork, and campus exclusivity instead of bayonets and bullets. We fight for celebration of our race, background, gender, or sexuality instead of preservation of our lives. And we talk about these problems as if the fate of Western democracy hung in the balance.
These struggles are not trivial, and Harvard students have certainly experienced adversity beyond these trials of undergraduate life. But do we really understand, as a generation, how much we’ve been given?
There’s nothing wrong with the privilege we have as Harvard students. Noble men and women like Merrill sacrificed their lives so we could worry about midterms instead of mustard gas. But they didn’t dig trenches so that we could use our exceptional opportunities to bunker down in the Harvard College rut—unable to see beyond our own problems or preconceived notions of success. Merrill fought for something bigger than a college campus that conformed to his own ideas of political, ideational, social, and emotional correctness. He sought something better than a lucrative job he knew he wouldn’t enjoy. How can we use our opportunities—secured by the sacrifice of those like Merrill—to do the same? It may not look like fighting in muddy trenches, but maybe it starts with keeping our own pressing problems in perspective—and realizing how privileged we are to be here in the first place.
So why does it take a misplaced bookmark to remember Wainwright Merrill? For the oldest university in America, Harvard seems strangely—and dangerously—determined to forget its past. We have no scruples editing out our Puritan founders from our alma mater when their ethnicity no longer serves the 21st century summum bonum of diversity and inclusion. Our idea of tradition is impish college conduct, rather than remembering the admirable men and women like Merrill who came before us. And, as a result, we’re missing what these true “citizens and citizen-leaders” can teach us—how to dig our own trenches and fight for noble ends bigger than ourselves.
If today’s Harvard students want to match the character and caliber of the generations that came before us, we should learn to stop skipping introductions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year at a party, my friend and I undertook a daring endeavor: We pushed our way through the throng of sweaty college students to find the DJ.  We were going to request a song.
“Do you know ‘Come Sail Away?’” I said to the DJ.
“Yeah?”
“Can you play it next?”
“Sorry, we don’t play that kind of music. The kids don’t like that kind of stuff.”  Disheartened, I shuffled away from the DJ stand. As I left, “Closer” came on, and the crowd went wild.
I hate to admit it, but that DJ is right. All of my friends would much prefer to listen to “Closer” rather than “Come Sail Away.” The Chainsmokers and other candy pop groups like them dominate Harvard’s music scene, and it seems like some students listen to little else. I think that’s sad.
Music groups like the Chainsmokers are successful because they produce catchy music, not because they produce good music. So I urge you to change your radio station every once and a while. Why? Because pop music is unoriginal and uninspired, and there’s better music out there.
Often pop music is not actually written or composed by the artist who sings it. In an article published by the Atlantic a few years ago, Nathaniel Rich describes how “middle-aged Scandinavian men...write most of America’s pop hits.” He discovers that some of the most famous songs on the radio—“Bad Blood” (Taylor Swift), “Hey Mama” (David Guetta featuring Nicki Minaj), “Worth It” (Fifth Harmony), “Can’t Feel My Face” (The Weeknd), “The Night Is Still Young” (Minaj)—are, in fact, written through a “formula” overseas and then sold to American record labels. And this music is far from original. Rich explains that these “pop hitmakers frequently flirt with plagiarism,” with “purposeful replication” of successful beats and melodies. This is music fast food: commercialized and unoriginal.
It wasn’t always like this. Some of the most iconic rock songs of the 20th century—“Baba O’Reilly” (The Who), “Bohemian Rhapsody” (Queen), “Stairway to Heaven” (Led Zeppelin)—were created by a couple of musicians jamming in their garage, trying new chord progressions, improvising new melodies, and scratching down their ideas on scraps of paper: a true creative process. One of the most important rock and roll albums, Dark Side of the Moon, was written just like this. In an article by Newsweek, Roger Waters, the lead guitarist in Pink Floyd, described this process: “I remember sitting in the kitchen and explaining this idea; that the whole record might be about the pressures and preoccupations that divert us from our potential for positive action, if you like.” This creative composition is real and thoughtful, made through the ingenuity and inspiration of other human beings, not computers. And, in Rogers Water’s case, the result was one of the most famous albums ever written.
My argument here is not that you should listen only to old music; of course, not all contemporary music is low-quality. Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” is a masterpiece. Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly” is as catchy as it is woke. Coldplay, Frank Ocean, Eminem, Cage the Elephant, The Killers?  All high quality artists and groups. And there’s so much more: Louis Armstrong, OK Go, KC & The Sunshine Band, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Wilco, Stevie Wonder, Wayne Shorter, The Black Keys, Santana. If we restrict ourselves only to the songs we hear at parties, we’re missing out on entire genres of music.
Now I’ll admit, sometimes low quality pop music is a nice break. Sometimes it’s fun to just dance and not think about anything else. But if you’re only ever listening to music as a distraction, you’re obviously not getting everything you can out of the musical world. So I challenge you to go on Spotify and try something new: Look up The Who or The Beatles, and listen to their top five songs. If you’re really adventurous, try Herbie Hancock, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, or Steely Dan. Then look up “Come Sail Away” by Styx, and I dare you to tell me that’s not good music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past year has brought with it chilling stories of deportation, of families being torn apart, and of an American president dangerously enabling those with anti-immigration views. Despite the evidence that immigrants bring many benefits to this country and that deportation is a human rights violation, many in this country fail to consider the very real human costs that deportation engenders. Over in New Haven, students have rallied to support Melecio Andazola Morales, the father of Yale senior Viviana Andazola Marquez, who was detained, separated from his family, and put into deportation proceedings.
This devastating state of affairs is not only chilling but sobering, as it is not a problem solely localized to New Haven. At Harvard, there are many students who may have similar experiences to Andazola Marquez—who may be undocumented, part of mixed immigration status families, or have close relationships with those who are, and thus live in fear of deportation for themselves or their loved ones. The life-altering events that have afflicted the Andazola Marquez family could just as easily have affected one of our own. Even if we ourselves may not come from such a background, we must become educated and informed about immigration issues to better understand when and how our fellow students are affected.
In looking at the events that have occurred at Yale, we would push for Harvard to create contingency plans for situations like these, thinking about how they can support students who are impacted by immigration issues, especially those who belong to mixed-status families.
Therefore, it is imperative that every single person holding a position of power at the University be educated about issues of immigration affecting the Harvard community. If a student is having a crisis or breakdown because their lives have been devastated by a family member being deported, all Harvard officials should be prepared to help that student.
We stress that this is not an issue that can be shelved for a few months or delegated to a task force. Harvard cannot and should not wait: They should plan now. And while we hope Harvard’s administration acts as rapidly as a situation of this magnitude would dictate, we are glad student groups like Act on a Dream have demonstrated solidarity with Andazola Morales. Their tireless work to address these deep, raw issues and help students affected by these issues is commendable.
We encourage students who are sympathetic of the plight of the Andazola Marquez family to show support by signing a petition that is circulating around Yale and by donating to the GoFundMe page that Yale students have set up to assist Andazola Marquez’s father.
For those who might look at the complexity surrounding immigration and think of it as an abstract, impenetrable issue, this situation should remind them that it is not. It is a human rights issue. This matters not because it concerns a Yale student’s family but because it concerns a human being. Deportation and other anti-immigration injustices occur every day, especially in the current political situation.
It is unfortunate that the catalyst for talking about this issue was the fact that the man’s daughter was a Yale student. We hope this tragedy serves as a springboard for constructive dialogue surrounding immigration issues across campuses and the country and that the anti-immigrant rhetoric ceases. We cannot afford to wait for the next immigration injustice—not one more.

As hoards of rowing enthusiasts prepare to descend on Cambridge for the annual Head of the Charles Regatta, Square businesses and University staff are gearing up for the influx of visitors.
Celebrating its 53rd anniversary this year, the Head of the Charles Regatta, a prominent rowing competition, is expected to draw more than 1,700 volunteers, 11,000 athletes, and tens of thousands of spectators from around the world this weekend. Ahead of the event, local businesses are staffing up, and University administrators are tightening security.
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she is excited about the increased traffic the event brings to local shops, calling the regatta an “economic opportunity for the Square that we don't often get.”
But Head of the Charles means more than just an economic boon for Harvard Square, Jillson said.
“In terms of the overall impact on Cambridge, it's a source of community pride that we're part of this much larger global community, and that's a good reason to celebrate,” she added.
Marie C. Beauchamp Hurtado, an employee at the Harvard Coop, said this weekend and that of the Harvard-Yale football game are the two busiest of the year.
“Nothing else really compares. Maybe Harvard-Yale when it’s here, but Yale students don’t want to buy our gear, so it’s mostly the regatta,” said D. Brady Stevens ’19, an employee at the Harvard Shop.
Businesses are making preparations to deal with the increased crowds. Matthieu R. Nadeau, another employee at the Harvard Coop, said that the store is increasing staff and putting out Harvard Crew gear in preparation for the weekend.
Grafton Street Pub and Grill brings in more waitstaff for Head of the Charles than it would on a typical Saturday or Sunday, manager Morgan C. Carney said.
“You know you’re not going to get any break—you know it’s going to be start to finish. The past few years, I’ve worked open to close during the regatta. That’s the kind of day it is,” Carney said.
Several employees of Harvard Square businesses noted that this weekend may be particularly busy because of the forecasted warm weather.
“This is my fourteenth regatta year, and this looks like the best weather we’ve ever had,” Carney said.
The massive crowds inundating Cambridge are also cause for increased security precautions throughout town and across campus.
In an email to students Monday, the Freshman Dean’s Office said that restrictions will be placed on access to the Yard and freshman dorms on Friday and Saturday nights. Entry to the Yard will be restricted to Harvard ID holders from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., dorm common rooms will be locked, and freshmen must register overnights guests with the University.
According to the event’s website, security officers will be at the event site Friday and Saturday evenings.

An entryway of students on the second floor of Quincy House’s Stone Hall “unanimously” voted to designate all hallway bathrooms on their floor as gender-neutral.
The reclassified bathrooms add to the one existing gender-neutral bathroom located in each entryway of Stone Hall.
Noah R. Wagner ’18, an entryway resident who spearheaded the change, said that interest in gender-neutral bathrooms arose “organically” at an entryway meeting with their tutor. Following a survey distributed to the entryway, all the students living on the floor unanimously supported the removal of existing signage and replacement with a new “gender-neutral” marker. according to Wagner.
“Every tutor should be asking their entryway what they want to have, gauging people’s comfort, and doing something that works for everyone,” Wagner said.
Wagner added that “much more needs to be done to improve gender-neutral accommodations” and that a centralized list of gender-neutral bathrooms is not readily available.
A resource page of the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life website for transgender or genderqueer students reads: “Harvard University includes gender identity in our non-discrimination statement, so people who use restrooms aligned with their gender identity are protected by the university.”
Installing additional gender-neutral bathrooms has been a priority in the ongoing project to renovate the upperclassmen Houses. Each of the Houses that undergo renewal will have a gender-neutral bathroom and shower on each floor, and upperclassmen are also permitted to form mixed-gender rooming groups in all Houses, though assignments vary based on availability.
Ted G. Waechter ’18, a Crimson editorial editor who lives in the entryway, said that there needs to be a more official process for designating gender neutral bathrooms in the Houses.
“I really feel like there ought to be a clear institutional mechanism by which students are guaranteed access to these resources,” Waechter said. “We believe that no sort of experience of students should vary based on the experience of their tutor.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that “the College is reviewing the situation carefully, in collaboration with local leadership at the Houses.”
Quincy House Faculty Dean Lee Gehrke wrote in an emailed statement that he was pleased by the “inclusive” process and supported the entryway’s decision to create gender-neutral bathrooms.
“The entryway tutor, who helped guide the process, reported to use that the discussions were thoughtful, collaborative, and not at all contentious,” Gehrke wrote. “We received updates on the ongoing discussion but our direct role was limited to helping obtain new signage.”
“We have received no complaints nor comments about the gender neutral terminology and use,” Gehrke added.
Residents of the floor like Eric J. Cheng ’20 have also welcomed the change in bathroom arrangements.
“It’s inclusive and easier, and it kind of just feels normal when going to the bathroom as it would in any other bathroom,” Cheng said. “It is not only progressive, but also pretty convenient implementation.”

Harvard’s first-ever Black Playwrights Festival kicked off Thursday with a reading of an original student play and a conversation on intimacy and authenticity in black theater.
Organizers Ian A. Askew ’19 and Madison E. Johnson ’18 said they created the festival to bring awareness to black theater at Harvard.
“Sometimes mounting a full production makes it so that you don’t get to see a full breadth of work,” Askew said. “So I figured it would be interesting to have a bunch of plays read so that you could have a lot of creative energy and expression get out.”
“Black Narcissus,” a play written by Patric C.W. Verrone ’18 and read at Thursday’s event, explores the intricacies of race and sexual identity, according to Verrone; all the characters are Greek and Egyptian mythological figures.
Rediet G. Alemu ’21, Aidan C. Campbell ’17, Kelcee A. Everette ’18, and Eden H. Girma ’18 joined Verrone in a reading of “Black Narcissus.”
In one scene of the play, Verrone’s character, Black Narcissus, explains his high school friends’ callous response to his being mixed-race.
“All the Asians wanted me to be Asian, the black kids wanted me to be light-skinned, the white kids wanted me to be Italian. Everybody wanted to claim me,” Verrone said. “Checking boxes shouldn’t be that hard, you know.”
At the conclusion of the play, Verrone repeats the phrase, “Black is beautiful is I am black is beautiful,” and all the characters join the empowering chorus.
After the play reading, critically-acclaimed playwrights Kirsten Greenidge and Robert O’Hara advised attendees on how to find one’s voice in theater.
For Greenidge, positive influences in childhood and education shaped the content of her plays.
“I had mentors and teachers who were very nurturing and did not shut down my voice,” Greenidge said. “From early on, I identified as a writer, at the ages of four or five, before I could actually write my name, and I was encouraged to do that.”
O’Hara, however, shared a different experience about finding his voice in playwriting.
“I was a little black gay boy in Cincinnati, Ohio,” he said. “I was never taken to a play, but I was always ‘othered’ already. Society had always said, ‘You are not normal. Get over there.’ So to pretend I was like everyone else was ridiculous.”
Both Greenidge and O’Hara encouraged young playwrights to write plays that were true representations of their own thoughts.
“You have to protect your work, and it requires a certain audacity to say that ‘what I have to say is important enough for you to hear,’” O’Hara said.
Zindzi L. Hammond-Hanson ’19, an inactive Crimson editor, said she enjoyed the play and the subsequent discussion.
“I think in general this event is a really good opportunity for people who are involved with arts—or not very involved with arts, at varying degrees—to come together and just celebrate black theater,” Hammond-Hanson said.

The Harvard Law Review launched a new online blog Tuesday aimed at providing more accessible, timely content alongside their usual long-form fare.
Known for their long essays and medium-length online articles, the Law Review’s new venture aims to provide a space for shorter, more informal pieces equally packed with stimulating legal commentary.
“We’ve been publishing long-form, in-depth analysis in our print volume for over a century,” said Kathleen S. Shelton, the Law Review's Blog Chair.
One of the most prestigious legal journals in the nation, the Law Review boasts a powerful alumni base including former U.S. President Barack Obama and Supreme Court Justices John G. Roberts, Jr. ’76 and Elena Kagan, a former Dean of the Law School.
Shelton said the addition of a blog format will help the Law Review reach a broader audience, “not just other law professors, judges, other law students or legal practitioners, but also people who are interested in these issues because they impact their lives and communities.”
Shelton also attributed the Law Review’s decision to a growing online legal community, which she called a “valuable place” for legal debate.
“We thought now we have the capacity, resources, desire to do it. It felt like the right time to try,” Shelton said.
While the current blog authors featured are mainly professors and legal practitioners, Shelton said the Law Review aims to address a variety of issues and is considering adding student voices.
Ingrid V. Eagly, a professor at the UCLA School of Law who wrote a recent post for the blog, said long-form law review articles can be difficult for readers without legal experience to understand.
“[Long-form pieces] don’t reach as many readers even though they contain important ideas, so having an alternative format may allow them to reach a broader audience,” Eagly said.
Eagly noted that long-form publications can result in “a lag between when ideas are generated and when they reach the public.”
Shelton said the blog would allow for more frequent publication due to the reduced writing and editing time required for blog posts.
“Instead of a six-month editing process, we’re talking about a day,” she said.
Harvard Law professor Jack L. Goldsmith and legal journalist Benjamin Wittes wrote in a Tuesday post that the new medium will “foster better debates.”
“Blogs are not, as they are often dismissed to be, shallow,” Goldsmith and Wittes wrote. “Of course they can be, just as an 80-page article can be. But to write well in this format, one must be expert enough to articulate the heart of an argument quickly and persuasively. That is not easy.”
“The ratio of insights to words...is usually very low in the traditional law review format,” they added.
Ultimately, though, Shelton said the blog will remain secondary to the printed journal itself.
“There’s tremendous value in the long-form, in-depth analysis that happen in our articles, so we would never forsake that. We see this more as a complement to that,” Shelton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October, 23 2017 at 9:44 p.m.
Harvard’s student unionization effort is stepping up its push to refer University affiliates to the Law School’s immigration clinics, arguing that the Harvard should better publicize its resources for immigrants and refugees.
The International Scholars Working Group—a part of Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—is devoting more time to these clinical referrals for students in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, a provision that protects some immigrants from deportation if their home countries are deemed too dangerous to return to.
More than 440,000 people from countries including Haiti, Sudan, and Syria are currently protected under TPS. TPS protections for South Sudan and Sudan were recently renewed, South Sudan for 18 months and Sudan for 12 months.
The Law School’s Immigration and Refugee Clinic has been Harvard’s first line of defense against Trump’s anti-immigration policies, offering legal assistance to Harvard affiliates with immigration concerns and filing high-profile amicus briefs in cases challenging Trump's travel bans.
Still, according to Patricia N. Manos, a graduate student and supporter of the unionization effort, some Harvard affiliates are unaware of the University’s legal resources for TPS recipients.
“We realized that there is a whole lot of need for information and that people who are affected by TPS are often having a hard time finding legal resources,” she said. “People sometimes don't know where to turn.”
Manos added that the University’s legal clinics are also open to Harvard employees and students’ families: “It's worth noting, and a lot of employees don't know this, that the legal clinic is interpreting the Harvard community pretty broadly,” she said.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote that Harvard has worked to publicize the legal clinics extensively in the wake of Trump’s election.
“Over the past several months, the University has worked to provide additional resources and support and to advocate for our international students and scholars, who play a critical role in Harvard’s academic mission,” she wrote. “These services have been and continue to be communicated to students in a variety of ways.”
Formed in early 2017, the International Scholars Working Group engages in various initiatives related to immigration. In February, the group presented University President Drew G. Faust with a petition calling for increased support for immigrants in the wake of Trump’s first travel ban, which barred immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and was later struck down by a federal judge.
According to HGSU-UAW’s website, the group’s current projects include creating a list of resources that Harvard should provide to international students, compiling a list of legal concerns, and bringing in experts to address them.

This is part III in a six-part series on Harvard's next president. Part I can be read here, part II can be read here, part IV can be read here, part V can be read here, and part VI can be read here.
It was only a few hours after President Donald Trump announced his intention to end Obama-era protections for undocumented youth that University President Drew G. Faust issued her rebuke.
“This cruel policy recognizes neither justice nor mercy,” Faust wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates in September. “In the months to come, we will make every effort to have our voice heard, in the halls of Congress and elsewhere, about the need for the protections of DACA to continue.”
This was not the first time Faust had unequivocally—and swiftly—opposed one of Trump’s policy proposals. Since Trump’s election, Faust has intensified her efforts to protect Harvard’s policy interests, including protecting undocumented students, securing federal research funding, and maintaining the tax-exempt status of Harvard’s $37.1 billion endowment. She has signed op-eds, wrote letters, and traveled to Washington to protect Harvard from a presidential administration widely considered hostile to higher education in America.
It’s been almost a year since Trump won the election, and Faust’s efforts have largely been successful. But when she steps down in June 2018, Trump will still have over two years left in his term. Faust will pass the baton to her successor to continue her advocacy in D.C.—not only for the University, but for American higher education writ large.
Experts, alumni, and other higher education leaders say that Harvard’s next president must be able to effectively lobby federal lawmakers. They predict that the 15-member presidential search committee will value candidates who can navigate an unpredictable political landscape and protect Harvard’s interests, all while towing the line of the non-partisan advocacy required of Harvard under federal tax law.
“You really need to have somebody who is extremely personable and sociable,” said James Savage, a professor at the University of Virginia who has written about lobbying in higher education. “The ability to deal with a lot of individuals and people and constituents is part of the skillset you need.”
Lobbying has long been a responsibility for Harvard’s president. Every Harvard president since World War II has overseen a gradual expansion of the University's relationship with the federal government and reliance on its funding—Harvard received around $600 million in federal research money last year.
While lawmakers have occasionally threatened Harvard’s federal interests in the past—Faust dedicated her 2013 Commencement address to the perils of budget sequestration—Trump requires a new level of response.
According to former University President Derek C. Bok, lobbying the government is today far more important to the job than it once was.
“The president spends more time representing the University and the interests of higher education before different parts of the federal government,” Bok said.
Beyond her public criticisms, Faust has also privately met with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Vice President Mike Pence, and the University has filed several legal briefs opposing Trump’s policies.
Former Senior Associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy Thomas D. Parker ’64 said that the Trump administration presents a singular challenge to higher education. “Fundamentally, what’s so disturbing is that there are so many people in the administration and among the Trump supporters who just don’t believe in expertise or professionalism,” Parker, a former Winthrop House resident dean, said.  “If you don’t believe in experts and expertise then a large part of what colleges and universities do is irrelevant to you.”
The Trump administration’s budget for the next fiscal year involves heavy cuts to research funding as well as the elimination of federal funding for programs including the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.
In the battle against Trump’s impending budget cuts, the president of Harvard holds a powerful position in Washington, according to David W.  Leebron ’77, the current president of Rice University and board chair of the Association of American Universities. Many graduates of Harvard’s 12 schools go on to serve in the federal government, providing an access point for the University President to amplify the concerns of higher education leaders.
“It’s not just important for Harvard, it’s important to the higher ed community that Harvard has a president who can be a forceful advocate for higher education and research universities in particular,” Leebron, who also attended the meeting with Pence, said.
Maria M. Klawe, the president of Harvey Mudd College, agreed, stating that Harvard’s president must be “persuasive” and “articulate” while voicing concerns on behalf of higher education institutions.
Apart from research funding, university presidents and higher education leaders around the country have spoke out against Trump policies that directly target students, such as the travel ban—which barred immigration from predominantly Muslim countries—and the repeal of DACA.
“When we talk about higher education policy, most of the time we’re thinking about student aid,” Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council of Education, said in May. “But right now, the biggest concerns for colleges and universities are related to one, immigration; two, budget spending; and three, the tax code.”
Lawrence H. Summers, the Secretary of the Treasury under former President Bill Clinton, brought Washington know-how to Massachusetts Hall when he became Harvard’s 27th president in 2001. And while Summers’s tenure was ultimately short-lived, Harvard might again look to individuals familiar with life within the Beltway.
Several sources close to members of committee searching for Faust’s successor said that the ability to protect federal research funding and communicate effectively with lawmakers will be important qualifications for the job.
Klawe said that Shirley M. Tilghman, the former president of Princeton and a member of the search committee, will heavily consider a candidate’s capacity to lobby. Klawe worked with Tilghman at Princeton.
“There’s lots of concerns about whether funding will be cut for all kinds of areas of science… for medicine, for environmental science, climate change,” Klawe said. “She is certainly going to see the person who will be president of Harvard as someone who will be a strong advocate for the importance of research funding.”
Former dean of Harvard Business School Jay O. Light said that James W. Breyer, also a member of the search committee who serves with Light on the board of the Blackstone Group, will likewise highlight government relations as a priority.
“I think absolutely he would be an advocate for spending more on research both from the point of view of the government but also from the point of view of companies and institutions at Harvard and everyone,” Light said.
Ellen Davis served on Duke University's presidential search committee with David Rubenstein, who is now helping Harvard conducts its search. She said political acumen has become a more important qualification for higher education leadership.
"I suppose also an awareness that the political landscape in this country is more complex and the way in which national politics affect the university is more evident to us," Davis said.
But although a candidate with political connections may be able to lobby in Washington, D.C. more effectively, Savage, who has written on the subject, said that university presidents generally do not directly lobby lawmakers and instead tend to rely on federal relations offices in the capital.
Parker also said that the president may not need to have roots in Washington.
“It’s not really necessary that the new president be a kind of expert in federal relations, but you would expect most of the candidates would have some prior experience either as recipients of federal funds or somewhere around the federal arena,” Parker said. “But the truth is someone who had not so much experience in federal relations, if they have a good VP for federal relations, should do just fine.”
Regardless of the next president's background, however, continuing to lobby Congress in collaboration with other universities and organizations will remain imperative.
“I just think there are more pressures,” Leebron said. “Universities are bigger actors in some ways in almost every single measure.”

Amanda K. Glazer ’18 was doing homework in the Harvard Math Department common room, an airy, sunny, fourth-floor lounge filled with Ikea-style furniture, when a department administrator asked her to leave.
Glazer, a joint Math and Statistics concentrator, says the administrator told her: You cannot be here if you are not a math concentrator.
“Well, I am a Math concentrator,” Glazer replied. She says she was wearing a pink dress that day.
“[The official] told me that I really couldn’t be there if I wasn’t a Math concentrator and I was like, ‘Great, ’cause I am,’ and just held my ground,” Glazer says. “And then someone else came over a few minutes later and tried to do the same thing, but I just stayed there.”
Glazer says she believes her gender prompted the administrator to ask her to leave the room.
The incident—according to more than 20 Math Department affiliates, many of whom shared stories identical to Glazer’s—is not an isolated one. The department has since changed its common room policies, and students say the environment has improved—but affiliates point to the removal of female Math concentrators from their own department lounge as typical of a broader Math Department culture that disadvantages women.
Current and former students and faculty—male and female—say the department’s dearth of female faculty and graduate students creates a discouraging environment for women undergraduates; that women in the department are often told to take easier classes than their male peers; and that, in a department dominated by men, everyday faculty-to-student and peer-to-peer interactions leave women feeling conspicuous and uncomfortable.
Peter B. Kronheimer, who served as the chair of the Math Department until July, says the Department is aware of its gender issues and is working to resolve them. In the last few years, the department has offered senior professorships to at least three women—none of whom accepted the offers—and has stepped up efforts to recruit female graduate students.
“When criticism is offered, or difficulties become apparent, the department must act and must seek to address the problems wherever it can,” Kronheimer wrote in an emailed statement. “It has done so before, and will continue to do so, now and in the future.”
Students, too, have taken steps to address these problems, including founding a group—Gender Inclusivity In Mathematics, now two years old—specifically dedicated to making women feel more welcome in the department and to “reducing the gender gap” in math at Harvard.
In September 2015, Glazer and a few other students began meeting with members of the Math Department about the common room. By the end of the semester, they convinced administrators to stop policing the room and instead hang a new, silver plaque just above the coffee table. It reads: “The Department of Mathematics respectfully asks that the Common Room be used only by members and guests of the Department and undergraduate concentrators.”
In an email, Kronheimer acknowledged there was once an “issue” with student access to the Math Department common room, but called it a “situation that is now well in the past.”
Since the installation of the plaque, Glazer says, no one has tried to evict her or any woman she knows from the lounge. But she calls the experience a reminder of the work that remains to be done.
“Talk about unwelcoming—when you have a department that is literally kicking you out of what is supposed to be a community space to talk about and work on mathematics,” Glazer says. “That’s a huge problem, and I think that exemplifies a lot of the issues we’re having.”
Every Tuesday at 5:30 p.m., a handful of Math students and faculty head to the Mather House private dining rooms for “Math Table,” an optional, informal meeting at which department affiliates present their research and solicit feedback. The Math Department website urges everyone to come.
“All students, irrespective of their mathematical backgrounds, are strongly encouraged to attend and/or to give talks,” the site reads.
But, in almost four years at Harvard, Math concentrator Jennifer Hu ’18 never considered speaking.
“Every time I read the abstract, it was always men and they were always doing really super pure math,” Hu says. “So I was just terrified to do anything.”
Hu changed her mind about Math Table when a female preceptor sent an email over a Math Department list-serv encouraging students to sign up for the program. Hu says she would have deleted the message had it come from “just another” male professor—but getting an email from a woman was different. She decided to present.
Harvard’s math department has a long history of gender imbalance. French number theorist Sophie Morel became the department’s first full female professor in 2009, but she left the University for Princeton shortly afterward.
Among comparable institutions including MIT, Yale, Princeton, and Brown, Harvard is the only university whose math department lacks a single female “senior” professor—as Harvard defines it, a Faculty member with tenure who must conduct research. Faculty and undergraduates say the absence of women in positions of authority may deter women from pursuing ambitious projects—or even pursuing math at all.
In the 2016 spring semester, Glazer sent a survey on “Math Department community” to math students at five schools including Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Yale, and Brown. In a full report published online earlier this month, Glazer wrote that roughly 26 percent of surveyed Harvard female math concentrators reported deciding not to take a math course due to “gender imbalance” concerns at some point in their undergraduate careers. More than 80 percent of women Math concentrators responded to the survey.
Five current and graduated female math concentrators say they would have felt more confident in their studies had they had senior female role models.
“It would have been so much better to just have at least one woman who is tenured in the department,” former Applied Math concentrator Drisana M. Mosaphir ’17 says.
Kronheimer says the department has offered tenured professorships to three women in the past decade or so, though none of these women accepted the offers. The department is currently in the process of recruiting several more female candidates for senior faculty positions, though no formal offers have yet been extended.
Kronheimer says “diversity issues” like the lack of women remained at “the top of my mind” throughout his tenure as department chair.
“Senior hiring is a challenge for all the top departments in mathematics,” Kronheimer wrote in an emailed statement. “Harvard’s position in the academic world brings with it a responsibility to lead, and I regret that, on the important issue of creating a senior faculty which appropriately reflects the gender-balance of the pool, we have not yet succeeded in leading as we should.”
Some female faculty say they think the department must d0 more.
Math professor Robin Gottlieb—one of few women in the department, but who is not tenured and thus does not count as a senior professor—says she thinks it would be “wonderful” if the department hired “not just one but several women” as tenured, senior professors. She adds she hopes Harvard is heading “in that direction.”
Sarah S. Richardson, a professor of the History of Science and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality at Harvard who researches how science, gender, and race intersect, agrees with Gottlieb. She calls the hiring of one or more senior women in the Math Department the “one really pivotal change that needs to be made.”
Richardson says the Math Department’s lack of diversity sends a clear message.
“There is a sense that there is brilliance in math and that you either have it or you don’t, and that Harvard math knows what that looks like and can define it, and there are not or are very few women who meet that,” Richardson says. “That’s the sum of my experience with Harvard math.”
The lack of female faculty mirrors low levels of female Math concentrators at Harvard. According to the National Science Foundation, women claimed 41.7 percent of bachelor’s degrees earned nationwide in mathematics in 2014. Glazer’s survey showed that, over the last six years, the College awarded on average nearly half that percent of bachelor’s degrees in math to women.
Hu presented at the Math Table in April 2017. A month later, she learned her presentation had won the Robert Fletcher Rogers Prize, awarded by Math Department faculty to the two best Math Table talks each year.
Hu says the email from the female preceptor first convinced her her research might be “just as important” as the male mathematicians’ work.
“Representation does matter a lot,” Hu says. “You just get used to not seeing people like you every day, I guess.”
Though the Math Department’s attempts to appoint senior female faculty have been largely unsuccessful, administrators have had far better luck hiring female graduate students. The 2017-2018 crop of graduate students boasts the highest percentage of women in recent memory, in large part due to two new programs designed to recruit women and debuted last year.
But, per policy, the Math department made no attempt to recruit undergraduates from within its own ranks. And as Harvard works to convince women from other schools to pursue advanced degrees in math, some current and graduated College female Math concentrators say they feel—or have felt—discouraged from taking higher-level classes or pursuing a graduate degree in math.
The department undertook two new initiatives in the 2016-2017 school year: in one effort, the graduate student admissions committee added two extra members who reviewed only female candidates during last year’s application cycle. Administrators also sent letters to promising female undergraduates around the world inviting them to apply to Harvard’s program, a step Kronheimer says was unprecedented during his tenure as chair.
“The common metaphor for the lack of women in STEM fields is the ‘leaky pipe,’ which means that not only are women candidates being overlooked due to perhaps implicit bias considerations, but also women are dropping out of the pipeline for lack of encouragement or lack of opportunity,” he says.
“I think of it as just being determined to keep making sure the pipe is not leaky,” Kronheimer adds.
Will Boney, a postdoctoral fellow in the Math Department who served on the graduate admissions committee, says these measures stemmed from faculty concern over the complete lack of female graduate students in 2016-2017.
“Last year... there were no women,” Boney says. “And this had followed a trend of none or few for the past couple years, so the department tried to make sure that this trend didn’t continue.”
The two programs bore fruit: the 2017-2018 class of graduate students is one-third female, according to Kronheimer. This number is nearly double the typical percentage of women graduate students, which has fluctuated between 10 and 15 percent over the last five years, Kronheimer says.
For Brooke S. Ullery, another postdoctoral fellow who also served on the admissions committee, the changes to the application process and the extra outreach to female undergraduates signalled a commitment to solving issues of gender diversity.
“It seems like people are definitely aware of it and they’re trying to do something about it,” Ullery says. “I’ve definitely had more gender-based problems at other places than here.”
But administrators sent no letters soliciting applications from Harvard undergraduates. So while women around the world received missives asking them to consider Harvard’s graduate program in 2016, some in Cambridge say they felt forgotten by the Math Department.
In particular, female Math concentrators say they are often told to take easier classes while at the College. This advice, they say, implies that women should not pursue graduate studies in mathematics.
Math 55: “Honors Abstract Algebra” has a cult-like reputation for difficulty on campus; the department website calls it “probably the most difficult undergraduate math class in the country.” In five out of the last ten semesters, no women chose to take Math 55. And over the past five years, less than seven percent of students enrolled in Math 55 were female, according to official course enrollment data.
Vikram Sundar ’18, who concentrates in Math, says the “gender ratio” in challenging math classes was one of the first things he noticed when he arrived on campus four years ago. He says he thinks this gender gap is due in part to “differential treatment” of women in Harvard math’s advising system.
“The end result of a lot of advising is that they end up encouraging a lot of girls to take lower-level classes,” Sundar says. “I think it’s not that the department is explicitly sexist at all. I’ve never met an explicitly sexist professor; it’s more that they’re just less aware of what they are doing.”
Applied Math concentrator Mosaphir says Harvard Math Department culture taught her to think of graduate school as an impossibility. She thought being a woman—and not “a naturally brilliant math bro”—disqualified her from pursuing studies in higher math.
But after Mosaphir spent six weeks in summer 2016 interning at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, she gained the confidence to apply to graduate programs. She began a Ph.D. program in pure math at the University of Minnesota in July 2017.
Mosaphir says the internship at the Institute revolutionized her conception of “what she could do.”
“A lot of people don’t see themselves as welcomed in the concentration,” she says. “It was super refreshing to meet people who were not as doubtful as I was about graduate school—they were just like, ‘Yeah, I want to go to grad school.’”
Former Math concentrator Caitlin K. Stanton ’14 says she felt steered toward easier classes even before officially joining the Math Department. Her freshman year, she attended a large advising event and asked the man sitting behind the math table whether she should take Math 55 or an easier class.
He told her if she had to ask she must not be “cut out for it," adding that “Math 55 is more of a calling than a decision.”
“I don’t know for sure that he looked at me and saw I was a woman and made that assumption,” she says. “But I feel like if I went up there and was a man, he might have taken me a bit more seriously.”
At first, Math concentrator Kathleen C. Zhou ’17 says she was ecstatic to see the 95 on her exam. But before her professor handed Zhou the test, he stopped and double-checked the grade. “Wow,” he told her. Then he passed the test back.
Zhou says she froze.
“What does that mean?” she remembers thinking. “Does that mean, ‘Oh, wow, you did a great job?’ or ‘Wow, I didn’t expect you would actually turn out okay?’”
Years later, Zhou still remembers this moment. She—along with roughly a dozen undergraduate and graduate women affiliated with the Math Department—say they feel worn down by the casual, questionable asides and comments they regularly hear from male peers and professors.
Worst of all, the women say, is the uncertainty. They ask themselves: “Am I imagining things? Am I being oversensitive? Am I crazy?”
Ullery, the postdoctoral fellow who taught Harvard undergraduates for the first time two semesters ago, recalls one undergraduate who refused to believe she was right and he was wrong about a mathematical proof, despite her repeated explanations. Ullery says she was not certain the student distrusted her because she was a woman—but she wondered.
Glazer’s 2016 study revealed that 66 percent of surveyed female math concentrators at Harvard report hearing comments from other students linking their gender to mathematical ability. The survey invited women to write down the specific negative comments they remembered, comments like:
“You’re a girl, you overthink the problem too much.”
“You’re good at math—for a girl.”
19 percent of surveyed female Math concentrators report hearing these types of comments from Math Department faculty members.
“The sexist comments, those things kind of stick in your memory,” Hu says. “And also just the feeling of being the only woman… the thing that sticks out to me is just a sort of everyday struggle.”
Kronheimer says the department is working to improve its culture.
“The overwhelming feeling I have about this department is that it is supportive of all, and I hope and believe that this feeling is widely shared,” he wrote in an emailed statement. “We all continue to work on building and maintaining an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.”
Some women say they think the math department has become more welcoming in the past two years. Many say the 2015 founding of student-run group Gender Inclusivity in Math has been instrumental in this improvement. They also cite monthly women-only math department lunches, a roughly three-year-old initiative led in part by Gottlieb.
Gender Inclusivity in Math co-presidents Cameron A. Krulewski ’19 and Elba Alonso-Monsalve ’19 point to several initiatives the group has undertaken. The two women have helped organize advising events, community-building socials, and “Math Night,” a weekly Monday evening event in Leverett House dining hall where students can informally gather to work on problem sets and discuss math more broadly.
Most recently, on Oct. 2, the department received a grant from the National Science Foundation to fund regular meetings between female undergraduates, graduates, and preceptors, an initiative dubbed “Mathematics ClusteRs Engaging Women,” or CREW.
To some women, the plaque in the common room also stands out as a sign of progress.
But, looking back across Harvard history, Glazer says she is shocked by how much hasn’t changed.
“I get so frustrated looking at the numbers, [the] degrees conferred by gender for math. It hasn’t changed in 50, 100 years; it’s been the same,” she says. “It’s just like—how has this been a problem for this long?”
She pauses.
“That’s just crazy to me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Thirty-two years ago, the world was a different place. Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev were navigating two superpowers toward a peaceful resolution of the Cold War, Michael Jordan was named the 1985 NBA’s Rookie of the Year, and Microsoft was introducing its first version of Windows. Even the Harvard campus looked distinct from its 2017 state, with the merger with Radcliffe College still nearly a decade and a half away. Yet, in the stretch of Cambridge, Mass., running along the Charles River, one thing was very much the same as it is now: Charley Butt and Liz O’Leary were coaching crew.
Charley Butt began his coaching career after a decorated career as an oarsman. Three years before graduating from Rutgers University, Butt represented the United States at the 1980 World Rowing Championships as a member of the lightweight eight. Two years later, he was hired to coach men’s lightweight crew at Harvard, and his ascent to program icon began.
Butt’s tenure as the Crimson’s lightweight coach has been full of accomplishments, to say the least. Of his 28 seasons in charge, Butt has posted winning dual records in 25. During that time, Harvard won 15 Eastern Sprint crowns and nine national championships. Butt also led the Crimson to its first Head of the Charles victory in nearly four decades—the lightweight team’s 2012 victory.
The loss of the legendary coach Harry Parker, who led the Harvard heavyweight crew team for 51 years, left behind an immense gap in the Crimson program. Given his proven success with the lightweight team, the Athletic Department gave Butt the reins to the heavyweight program in 2013, making Butt just the ninth man in Harvard history to hold the position.
Since Butt took over the heavyweight program, the results have been much the same: continued proven success. With Butt at the helm, the Crimson posted an undefeated record in 2014, followed by a 6-2 record the next year and an impressive 7-1 showing last season.
And yet, the record books only tell half the story. Each successful team has been composed of athletes who have benefited from Butt’s instruction at an individual level, as well.
“Charley has taught me so much about what it takes to move a boat effectively,” captain Conor Harrity said.  “I’ve been able to experience a lot of individualized coaching in small boats (singles and pairs) and it has been incredibly helpful.”
Adding to Butt’s wealth of experience is the extension of his leadership well beyond Harvard. The list of Olympians who have trained under the coach is quite lengthy, and is only growing. With four go-arounds under his belt, Butt remains one of the coaches for the United States Olympic team.
For collegiate and Olympic athletes alike, Butt has driven countless oarsmen to maximize their potential.
“He.... has really helped me understand proper training and has provided all of us with great resources to get the most out of our training,” Harrity said.
In light of Butt’s 33 accomplished seasons, the possibility of seeing a parallel legacy at the same school, in the same sport seems almost beyond belief. And yet, Liz O’Leary stands to disprove the improbable with 32 successful seasons of her own.
Like Butt, O’Leary entered the coaching profession in the wake of a strong rowing career of her own. A member of the 1976 and 1980 Olympic teams as well a medal winner at three of six appearances with the United States team at the World Championships, O’Leary was hardly new to the water when she took a job at the University of New Hampshire. She went on to create a lasting impact at UNH, becoming a member of the school’s Hall of Fame in 1994. O’Leary’s final stop before coming to Harvard in 1986 was in North Andover, Mass., where she steered the women’s crew team at Brooks School.
O’Leary’s time as the Harvard-Radcliffe heavyweight crew coach has truly been program-defining. Under her leadership, the Black and White has made 17 appearances in NCAA Championships. In 2003, Radcliffe took first place and earned the title of national champions. Two years later, O’Leary’s team won bronze. Over her last 16 seasons, the Black and White has posted winning records in all but three.
O’Leary’s coaching experience also stretches beyond Harvard. Over a dozen alumni of the Harvard-Radcliffe program during her tenure as head coach have rowed at either the U.S. World Championships or the Olympics. Also in common with Butt, O’Leary’s bears the experience of coaching at both the Olympics (1988) and at World Championships.
“Liz O'Leary has helped me realize my own potential as an athlete [by] developing intense mental fortitude, athletic strength and endurance, and technical prowess, all while fostering a collaborative team-environment,” senior rower Kathleen Malloch said.
While O’Leary’s coaching accomplishments alone are enough to warrant applause, for her rowers, it’s what happens beyond the water that really counts.
“She drives the helm of our collective ship, guiding us not just through practice, but through college,” Malloch said. “Her knowledge about the sport and expertise in the field are unparalleled and have dramatically improved my skills, confidence, and passion in the sport.”
“When I enter Weld Boathouse, there are endless framed pictures of Liz O's past crews, and I realize that she has been the same life mentor to each of these women as she is to me,” co-captain Sofia Donnecke added. “Her kind strength fills Weld boathouse and has made it all of our home away from home.”
In an age in which consistency and stability are often difficult to come by, Charley Butt and Liz O’Leary embody both.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 22, 2017 at 3:22 p.m.
Following in the footsteps of a parent, especially a parent who excelled in athletics and academics, is no easy task. For the Anderson family, however, this has become the norm.
Steve Anderson ’85 played four years of football at Harvard as a defensive end. Throughout his career, Anderson displayed a grit and tenacity on the gridiron that earned him All-American honors.
Twenty years later, Anderson’s sons, seniors Eric and Travis and sophomore Bryce, have continued their father’s legacy in both academics and athletics. Travis and Bryce are currently on the men’s heavyweight crew team, and Eric rowed for the team in his freshman and junior years.
Throughout elementary school and high school, the Anderson brothers participated in many different sports, but all eventually settled on crew. Bryce, although the youngest, began rowing first at Greenwich Water Club and eventually drew both his brothers into the sport. Travis and Eric eventually joined the Maritime Rowing Club, a 30-minute drive away from their home in Cos Cob, Conn.
“I was swimming, Bryce used to do diving, Eric had some other sports,” Travis said. “By the time high school came around, we all were looking for something new, and Bryce kind of led us into rowing.”
At the Maritime Rowing Club, Eric and Travis were paired in a double together, but initially struggled to row efficiently.
“Over time we realized, we should be able to do much better than than this,” Travis said. “And so I guess that ended up being good because we learned how to work better together, just both in rowing and in life.”
There was always, and continues to be, a healthy competitive culture between the brothers.
“We’re definitely really competitive brothers,” Bryce said. “We’ve all been competitive with grades or anything like that. It was definitely a constructive competitiveness, I suppose because we all weren’t necessarily amazing at crew or anything like that. We would kind of push ourselves with crew, [and] with academics, and we all ended up here.”
In this mutual competition, the Anderson brothers had the
help of not only their father but also their mother, Kathy, who supported her
children through numerous school events, music performances, and athletic
contributions. Both parents pushed the Anderson brothers to make the most of
their talents.
“I think there’s always amongst siblings, especially when you have twins like Eric and Travis, but I think it was a good, healthy competition,” the elder Anderson said. “It was neat for me because they all get in to crew, and I know[knew] nothing about crew until they started rowing, so it was a good new sport for me to learn, and very selfishly from a scheduling standpoint, it’s nice that they are all on the same schedule.”
Steve Anderson grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and was recruited to Harvard to play football.
“I had a dad who worked in a factory and mom who was a secretary, so I was pretty much a full scholarship kid back in the ’80s,” Steve Anderson said. “But I saw if you can combine strong academics and strong athletics, that’s a pretty good combination.”
When is came to his sons, Anderson’s view is no different.
“If you can convince kids that academics can help athletics, athletics can help academics, and if you can do the combination of them at such a high caliber institute as Harvard or something semi-equivalent, that’s a great combination in life.”
When raising his sons, Anderson emphasized the importance of athletics and the important interplay between schools and sports. Despite the emphasis on academics and athletics, the elder Anderson emphasizes that these are qualities that go beyond the classroom or the field.
“I think the whole environment, if used properly, can allow you to reach for things that you quite honestly didn’t think you were capable of achieving, whether it’s on the field, or because of things you do on the field, that you gain confidence academically, you can gain confidence in the work environment, you gain confidence in the social environment,” Steve Anderson said. “I think it’s a great part of the building of all your life skill, and I hope the kids get that too.”
Growing up, the brothers were well aware of their father’s impressive accomplishments playing football. Steve Anderson would talk about how much he loved playing for the Crimson.
“I think it was definitely an inspiration to see just how good our dad had been playing football here; he did quite well overall,” Eric said. “And I think the biggest impact was just for us, when we were talking to our dad about his college experience, he would talk about how athletics helped shape the academic side and gave him a really balanced, really great college experience.”
For the Anderson brothers, their father’s experiences made not only the prospect of going to Harvard a dream, but also made them consider competing for the school in sports.
“I felt my dad being a really good athlete at Harvard immediately put Harvard and Harvard athletics on the map,” Bryce said. “From a very young age, I think I made a PowerPoint when I was six that said I want to go to Harvard and play football there. It’s a little cheesy but, it definitely put Harvard on the map, and our dad definitely pushed us, not in a bad way, definitely in a good way.”
All three brothers, however, were quick to note the large
influence that their mom had over their lives, whether through sports or
academics. Both parents placed an emphasis on effort over outcome. Such support
played a key role in driving the Anderson brothers to the crew program.
At Harvard, all three brothers walked onto the men’s heavyweight team as freshmen. Although being walk-ons presented challenges, the brothers said that they enjoyed their experience.
“I got kind of lucky that the rowing team is pretty receptive to walk-ons and if you keep putting the effort in, they’ll keep you around and invest time in you, so I think it ended up being a nice match,” Travis said. “When Eric and I came in, there was a lot of work to be done, and they were really good about helping us at least improve our fundamentals well enough so we weren’t floundering, and since then it’s been great.”
Eric Anderson said that he is grateful for the walk-on tradition at Harvard and recognizes that it helped him develop a mentality and desire for self-improvement.
“It was pretty special to first off have us all here at Harvard, and certainly even more special for all of us to be able to walk-on to the men’s rowing team and row there,” Eric said. “So, I really think it allowed us to further bond as brothers, and it brought us closer together.”
With the Head of the Charles Regatta looming ever near, Bryce Anderson, who will be racing in it for the first time, expressed his excitement. Travis had some advice for his younger brother.
“It is a super unique experience,” he said. “Most of the time, rowing events get nowhere near this amount of attention and there’s not nearly as many boats all in the same area. It’s kind of an experience you have to take in. It’s going to be a normal race, so it’s going to hurt and it’s going to be hard, but also, just savor the moment as best as possible.”
Steve Anderson said he is always excited to watch not only his sons compete, but also their teammates, many of whom he has gotten to know through the years.
“It’s very easy to see when a boat is really in sync and moving, and it’s pretty beautiful to watch, and it’s a little poetic looking,” Steve Anderson said. “It’s not unlike watching a football team that’s clicking on all cylinders or a baseball team that’s really got it going or a basketball team that’s really on fire. It’s a very fun thing to watch when it happens.”
The Anderson brothers said that they appreciate the structure that athletics provide, and the camaraderie and work ethic that crew demands. In general, Steve Anderson said that he enjoys seeing the progress his sons have made, and hopes that they continue implementing the skills that they’ve learned from balancing athletics and academics by continuing to row after college, whether for leisure or at a competitive level.
“I think all three of them have done a really good job at balancing an academic drive and an athletic drive,” Steve Anderson said. “I think that’s hopefully put them in a position for good success in life, however they want to define success.”

It’s that time of year again. The leaves are turning, the air is chilling, the penultimate weekend of October is approaching, and the people are gathering—gathering along the Charles River, that is.
While these occurrences may proceed to proceed like clockwork, what will happen this weekend is far from ordinary. After all, this is the Head of the Charles.
Over the course of two days, close to 400,000 spectators will congregate along the Charles to bear witness, while up to 1,700 volunteers will work behind the scenes. This effort will all revolve around the more than 11,000 athletes who will be compete in 66 different race events for the distinguished title given to the winners: “Head of the Charles.”
Historically, some have referred to the famed regatta as crew’s equivalent of the Boston Marathon, in terms of the event’s magnitude and importance to the sport. Such comparisons are not overreaching, as only the Boston Marathon draws a larger crowd to the city each year. Just for perspective, the Head of the Charles will attract more than three times the spectators this weekend than would a sellout crowd at Gillette Stadium, Fenway Park, and TD Garden combined.
The Head the Charles Regatta is a big deal for more than just the Boston area. The sport as a whole will take notice, as this weekend marks the largest two-day rowing event in the world.
“It's an unparalleled opportunity to compete as an 18- to 22-year-old collegiate athlete against Olympians or world champions, with hundreds of thousands of spectators on your home course,” said senior heavyweight rower Kathleen Malloch.
What has grown to become a globally-renowned event began as a mere idea tossed around by a handful of rowers. At the suggestion of Harvard sculling instructor Ernest Arlett, three co-founders of the Cambridge Boat Club—D’Arcy MacMahon, Howard McIntyre, and Jack Vincent—held the first regatta on October 16, 1965. Holding low expectations regarding attendance, these planners expected the Head of the Charles to function as a break between fall and spring training. Little did these Cambridge men know what their humble race would eventually become an international spectacle.
In the years since 1965, the field of athletes competing has consistently proven to be one of a high caliber. This year will be no exception.
“The competition is fierce,” said co-captain and Harvard heavyweight rower Sofia Donnecke. “The mentality of the athlete is always...at the end of the day, the boat that was willing to fight hardest will come out on top.”
Race entries can take the form of singles, doubles, fours, or eights, and the participants can range anywhere from 14-year-old novices to 85-year-old veterans. The athletes will first take to the water on Saturday, as the weekend will begin with the senior and master divisions for both men and women.
“We're always excited for another opportunity to race,” Malloch said. “Head of the Charles is particularly fun given the caliber of competitors and the size of the audience.”
Progressing into the evening, the championship, alumni, and lightweight groups will see some action. Sunday’s lineup with include mainly youth- and collegiate-level participants. The men’s and women’s championship eights, often considered the most anticipated events, will take place Sunday afternoon.
Harvard’s heavyweight and lightweight teams, both men and women, will compete this weekend. For the Crimson men’s heavyweight team, this weekend marks the first appearance of the fall season.
The men’s lightweight team, along with both the women’s lightweights and heavyweights, made its season debut earlier this month at the Head of the Housatonic regatta in Derby, Conn. Harvard will lean on that experience going into this weekend, as well as on the focused training that the teams have embraced in the previous weeks.
“Now that the Head of the Charles is coming, we are starting to merge into our respective boats for racing,” Donnecke said. “It is always exciting when we start forming crews because it gets each boat amped up to race.”
The Crimson will join competitors from around the world at the Boston University Boathouse to begin the race. The course, which is known for its difficulty, will stretch three miles through five triple-arch bridges. The races toward victory will end just after the Eliot Bridge.
“We are most excited to race against most of the teams who race at Eastern Sprints and the IRA Championships on our home course,” heavyweight captain Conor Harrity said. “It is a great early indicator of our potential for the season. We’ve got a very deep and talented program, and this weekend will be a great opportunity to show our talent in front of a local crowd.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Sean Hayes, crew was never just a sport.
From the first day he picked up a paddle, Hayes developed an intense passion for rowing. The sport has carried the freshman from Portland, Ore., to destinations as far-flung as Rotterdam, Netherlands; from regional competitions to international ones; and from King Low Heywood Thomas School to Harvard College.
Last summer, the Greenwich, Conn., native donned red, white, and blue to represent the United States on the global stage at the World Junior Rowing Championships in Rotterdam.
“The whole experience on the national team taught me so much about myself and self-reliance,” Hayes said. “Being around so many people who had so much experience really made me want to push myself, to prove I could [succeed] on the international level.”
But Hayes’ path to the world stage has been a relatively unconventional one. Unlike many athletic prodigies whose talents are crafted from the time they begin to walk, Hayes started rowing later into his adolescence.
It all began with a lie. In an effort to get him passionate about a sport, Hayes’ parents told him that one of his friends was interested in rowing. The scheme not only got him involved in crew but also ignited a passion.
“When I was a kid, all I really did was play video games. I didn’t really do a lot,” Hayes said. “I didn’t start rowing until fifth grade, and I wasn’t really in good shape. Rowing taught me the value of investing yourself in the things that you’re doing. Over the next few years, both my grades as well as my attitude and approach really changed for the better.”
Rowing was not the freshman’s first step into the world of athletics, however. The rookie initially dabbled in soccer without much interest.
Finding his arms more adept than his feet, Hayes began to achieve success at regional level rowing meets. He took the next step in his sophomore summer when he competed at the Youth National Championship, where he realized for his true potential for the sport.
The following summer, the lightweight rower followed through on his goal of improving on his fifth-place finish the previous year. Hayes posted the fastest time at the Youth National Championships, earning him an invitation to selection camp in Portland, Ore., for the Junior National Team.
“Selection camp was a very eye-opening experience for me—being away from home for so long, and meeting all of these rowers from around the country who were really, really talented.” Hayes said. “ Being around so many people who had so much experience gave me the mindset that I really wanted to push myself.”
That he did. At selection camp, Hayes performed well enough to make a boat. Later that summer, he traveled across the pond to represented the U.S. National team in the Junior Straight 4. For the freshman, competing in the Netherlands for the United States culminated six years of hard work.
One year removed from his trip to Europe, Hayes is still in the water but now sporting the crimson and white of Harvard. As a freshman, Hayes must grapple with not only a new level of competition but also an increased academic load.
The freshman believes that his rowing experience has prepared him for both aspects. Rowing, according to Hayes, has helped him grow—both as a student and as a person—in the eight years since his first stroke.
“I don’t think that I would be who I am today and where I am today if I hadn’t been exposed to rowing,” Hayes said. “Rowing requires discipline. You don’t succeed in the sport unless you are putting a lot of effort into it.”
With hopes of returning the Harvard team to success on the national level, the freshman will face one of his biggest tests this weekend when he participates in his first Head of the Charles Regatta as a member of the Crimson team.
This weekend, the college rookie will take his mere eight years in the sport to the stroke seat of the Varsity Lightweight 8 boat for Harvard.
“Sean is a terrific rower,” said sophomore lightweight coxswain Annina Kennedy-Yoon. “But he also brings a good attitude to practice every day and has stepped up to handle his role with grace.”
Despite experience in high-stakes international races, Hayes’ inaugural Head of the Charles may yet get those butterflies moving once again.
“I’m not too nervous now,” he said. “But when I’m sitting there, waiting for the race to start, and Yale is on my left and Princeton to my right, I think there’s going to be a lot of adrenaline coursing through my veins.”

When it comes to the U23 World Rowing Championships, rowers are culled from the far corners of their countries, and team members often don’t row with each other until training for the tournament begins.
In a sport that relies so heavily on synchronization and trust, this arrangement can force rowers to conjure chemistry with teammates out of thin air. Some of the Harvard crew freshmen that rowed at Worlds this summer, though, have known each other for years.
Olivia Farrar and Brigid Kennedy raced against each other in high school. They both competed in single sculls and struck up a friendship at the starting line of a race. When thinking about trying out for the national team’s double sculls, Kennedy was in need of a partner. So she contacted Farrar.
“I reached out to her and said, ‘Hey, I think we could put out a fast boat,’” Kennedy recalls. “‘Would you be comfortable living in my house for the summer and training together?’ And she said yes.”
After several whirlwind weeks of practice, the pair took to the waters for the US team trials. They were among the youngest participants; most U23 hopefuls are in their 20s—seniors in college. Farrar and Kennedy were both 18. They hovered near the front of the pack for most of the trials, but “never had the top times,” according to Farrar.
However, the summer of training paid off. Five hundred meters from the finish, something clicked.
“There’s this thing in rowing called swing,” Farrar says, smiling at the memory. “You perfectly fall into rhythm with somebody else, and you get an incredible boat run. Suddenly, our bow just surged forward. We ended up walking from the 500 meter mark all the way to the finish, until there was open water between us and the competition.”
The late surge was all they needed. Having earned a spot on the national team, the duo ultimately placed 11th at the international final. Before that performance, the last time that Team USA placed in a women’s double sculls final at the U23 Worlds was in 2014.
Fellow freshman Lucas Clarke also had a special run at Worlds. He placed first in the B final and seventh overall with the New Zealand Eight this summer.
“In New Zealand, it’s quite tight-knit, so we know each other quite well,” Clarke says. “We’ve heard of [each other] at least. You get to know people very well over the course of the camp.”
The newcomers all agree that the close community of Harvard rowers has helped maintain the trust and comfort level that made them successful in the past.
“Everyone is in contact all the time, checking in on classes and how you’re doing,” Kennedy says. “It’s wonderful.”
With a strong support system in place, the freshmen can take time to work out their academics and their training. The experience of older teammates is just as valuable here as on the water. But the strict practice schedule demands discipline, and that structure helps most of all.
“Being on a team has given my college life a good structure,” Clarke says. “I get up early in the morning to go train, and I can do work at night.”
Despite experience on the international stage, Farrar, Kennedy, and Clarke all attach special significance to the Head of the Charles. Clarke has never raced at the event before, while most of his American teammates would have by the time they began college. He will debut in the 2V boat.
“I’m really looking forward to it,” Clarke says. “So many people come to watch, and it’s a different type of race. It’ll be good to be racing some other top universities.”
The Head of the Charles races are also “head” events, meaning that teams are timed individually and do not compete side by side. This is unusual in Clarke’s home country, which hosts more head-to-head competitions.
For Kennedy and Farrar, residents of East Greenwich, R.I. and Pittsford, N.Y. respectively, the Charles is memorable because of its familiarity. Both have raced at the Head of the Charles in the past. As at Worlds, they will be in the same boat as part of the varsity eight.
“We come up here a fair amount to race, but to have it be your home turf is just really cool,” Kennedy says. “It’s also going to be a much faster race than I’m used to, being in an eight. I think it’s going to be magical.”
Farrar thinks that the anticipation for the Head of the Charles builds up week by week. That excitement has only amplified now that she’s on the host team.
“It’s such a great thing to finally be on the host side,” Farrar says. She pauses, and laughs. “It’s like Christmas.”

Home field advantage is a highly coveted asset in the world of sports. Competing at home means friendly crowds, minimal travel time, and perhaps most importantly, a sense of comfort and familiarity with one’s surroundings.
While the Harvard rowing program always reaps these benefits at the Head of the Charles, the phrase “home field advantage” takes on new meaning for brothers and Crimson rowers Andre and Nate Dempsey, both of whom grew up in Cambridge and learned to row on the Charles River.
In fact, this year will be senior heavyweight Andre’s seventh time competing in the Head of the Charles and sophomore lightweight Nate’s fifth. While the Head of the Charles may not hold the same novelty for the Dempseys as it does for the thousands of new rowers and spectators who will flock to Cambridge for the first time this year, the regatta still warrants much excitement.
“It’s fun because there’s so much attention on rowing,” Nate said. “I think normally rowing flies under the radar, but Head of the Charles is such a huge spectator event...because you can just sit on the shore and watch boats come by all day.”
Both Dempsey brothers attended high school, and first began rowing, at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, located less than a mile away from Harvard Yard and the Charles River.
Andre rowed for the Falcons for two years before joining Community Rowing, Inc., a private rowing club; Nate lettered all four years in crew at CRLS. In high school, the brothers would watch the Harvard boats on the water, and were especially impressed by the rowing of Patrick LaPage, who is now a Harvard heavyweight crew assistant coach.
“I used to watch him in the stroke seat of the Harvard Eight when I was a sophomore in high school...and he was just fantastic, unbelievably good,” Andre said. “Being able to come here and get coached by him, and then row in the same boats that I saw growing up is definitely inspiring.”
While they share much in common, including a love for crew, an interest in the sciences, and a Mather House affiliation, the Dempsey brothers have never actually rowed on the same team. When younger brother Nate began rowing for the CRLS varsity team, Andre switched to row for the Community Rowing, Inc. This trend continued into college, as Andre moved up to the heavyweight crew team the same year that Nate joined the lightweight team.
“We always manage to just miss overlapping on teams,” Andre said. “But just going to the same school brings us together a lot.”
One aspect in which the brothers are united is in their appreciation of the Head of the Charles as a uniquely exciting race.
“It’s very visceral racing because there are so many different boats going different speeds and it’s more tactical in terms of the line you’re taking and your ability to push other crews out,” explained Andre.
One of the tactical challenges of the course is navigation of the many bridges that cross the Charles. Eliot Bridge is especially notorious, coming at an almost 180 degree, horseshoe-like turn in the river. Eliot causes trouble for many out-of-town crews unfamiliar with the course, and, for the Dempseys, adds an element of physicality that is unique to the Head of the Charles.
“Every single year I’ve had an absolutely insane turn around Eliot,” Nate said.  “I always come into it with another crew, and half the time we clash blades or scrape.”
“There’s a lot of yelling,” Andre added. “You come up to other crews and if they are not yielding to you, you have to just hit them.”
In addition to intense battles for positioning, the Head of the Charles is known for the range of rowing talent that it draws each year. International and Olympic crews as well as teams from Oxford and Cambridge compete out of Harvard’s Newell Boathouse. This brings a new sense of excitement to the regatta, one that the Dempseys did not get to experience in high school.
What has remained the same, however, is the beauty of the course. While both brothers admit to having a soft spot for the rural splendor of Dartmouth’s Connecticut River, they agree that in the realm of city rowing, the Charles River is unparalleled.
“You come out and go through all the Harvard houses, and then you’re out in the basin and next to the Boston skyline,” Andre said. “Then you go downstream and you’re in the trees by the waterfront. There’s a lot of variation as you head toward the heart of the city.”
While many rowers only get to experience this beauty once each year when they come to Cambridge for the Head of the Charles, the Dempsey brothers are lucky to have this scenery as the backdrop to the majority of their rowing experiences. This weekend, they will hit the Charles yet again, racing down its familiar bends and turns in front of classmates, friends, and family. And this home advantage is a benefit that they will not take lightly.
“We’re on our home course,” Andre said. “It’s both an advantage and a responsibility to defend the Charles against other teams.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This game is everything.”
In a division proliferated with solid teams, junior linebacker Charlie Walker is probably right. Barring a miracle, a loss to Princeton tonight would likely push the Ivy League title beyond Harvard’s reach.
Sporting dual 1-1 conference records, the Crimson and the Tigers (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) will play out their division rivalry tonight under the lights of Harvard Stadium, marking only the 15th night game ever hosted by the Crimson. Under the lights, Harvard is 14-0.
“It’s a really big game,” said junior wide out Justice Shelton-Mosley. “For our identity as a team, coming from the Cornell loss and going back into Ivy League play, it’s a huge game. We need a win to stay in the running [for the title]. We want to control our own destiny—don’t want to rely on other teams.”
The last time the Crimson (3-2, 1-1) had a 1-1 conference record heading into the Princeton game, the year was 1996 and Harvard coach Tim Murphy was in his third season. The Tigers had a four-game win streak in the series and were coming off an Ancient Eight title season.
“We shut them out,” Murphy said. “They were in shock because they were heavily favored and Harvard hadn’t beaten them in a long time. It was the turning point for our program.”
The 24-0 win catalyzed two decades of dominance over Princeton, with the Crimson taking 17 of the last 21 contests, adding nine conference rings to its mantle for good measure.
Now, Harvard can hardly claim underdog status. On the heels of a decade of Ancient Eight success, the team comes into the matchup with history on its side. In addition to winning 80 percent of the last 21 meetings between the pair, the Crimson has not dropped a match to its rivals in orange in the last three years. But for a rivalry like the Tigers, every win is never good enough.
“The guys on the team hate them, I’m not going to lie,” Walker said. “I mean, we’re 3-0, but it’s not like we got to 3-0 easily.”
Princeton is by no means an underdog, either. The squad features an offense that has been nearly unstoppable in 2017. Even including the one loss, the Tigers have outscored opponents by 100 points, twice hitting the half-century mark.
The man behind the offensive prowess is senior quarterback Chad Kanoff. In five games, the veteran has accumulated 1,464 yards through the air—the most of any Ivy League quarterback.
Sometimes, gaudy passing statistics reflect a throw-first strategy. Not in this case—Princeton has actually run the ball one more time than it has tossed on the season. Kanoff just happens to be the most accurate quarterback in the FCS. Boasting a completion rate of 73.9 percent, he  has several competent targets, which prevents defenses from focusing on a single deep threat.
“It’s challenging to defend this team because they have the ability in all formations, all field positions, to throw or run the football,” Murphy said. “I think that’s what every good offense has. It’s multidimensional.”
The two receiving mainstays are a pair of capable juniors, Jesper Horsted and Stephen Carlson. The former leads the team with 466 yards on 42 receptions, while his classmate has accumulated a similar 445 yards on 30 tosses. Kanoff’s 553 other yards are distributed among 10 targets.
For Harvard, the quarterback story is the polar opposite of this experienced cast. Under center will be freshman Jake Smith. However, the rookie is no stranger to competition, as he has started the last four games. Establishing himself as a competent leader in the preseason, Smith jumped two sophomores and a junior to earn the backup position. Taking second snaps to fifth-year senior Joe Viviano to start of the season, Smith proved himself and ultimately dethroned the veteran.
Even so, Kanoff’s stats dwarf Smith’s, partly because the freshman hasn’t seen as much playing time. Even still, with 527 yards through the air and two passing touchdowns, Smith barely matches 35 percent of his opponent’s yards.
“I don’t think it’s one of those games where we can expect our defense to hold them to one touchdown, as we have for much of this season,” Murphy said. “We’ve got to score points some offensively, do a good job defensively and somehow win the turnover battle to get a win against Princeton.”
Alongside Smith will be the Crimson’s true offensive juggernaut, junior running back Charlie Booker. In 2017, Booker has rumbled for 496 yards and five touchdowns. His 7.1 average yards per carry marks the fifth-highest in the FCS and second in the Ivy League behind Penn’s Karekin Brooks.
The Tigers’ biggest problem will be shoring up the substantial holes in its defense. Opposing teams have dropped 1,415 passing yards. In Princeton’s one loss this season, death came through the air, as Columbia hung 400 yards.
On the contrary, the Harvard defense has been mostly consistent, and—with exception to the Cornell game—dominant against the run. Overall, the group has held offenses to 14.8 points per game, 200.4 yards through the air, and 92.4 on the ground.
Injuries, however, have ravaged the Crimson front. Linebackers junior Anthony Camargo and sophomore Micah Hughes are out for the season, while sophomore linebacker Bobby Drysdale will also be out for a significant amount of time.
From here on out, all of Harvard’s game are against Ivy League opponents. And while the winner of this game still may not claim part of the division title, it is almost assured that the loser will have no chance.
“It’s going to be an exciting game,” Walker said. “I know we both want it really badly, but Harvard just really has a different hunger that we can’t really explain. We’re ready. I don’t know about Princeton, but we’re ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team welcomes perhaps its most difficult opponent of the season on Saturday, when No. 17 Princeton arrives in Cambridge looking to avenge last year’s home loss.
In a reverse of last season’s circumstances, the Crimson (7-7-0, 1-3-0 Ivy) enters the matchup after an up-and-down start to its conference slate while the Tigers (11-2-0, 3-1-0) have suffered just two losses in 13 contests. With just three games left in the season, Harvard will be looking for a signature victory against Princeton as it seeks to end the season on a high note.
The history is certainly there for this clash, as Harvard and Princeton have combined to claim the last five Ivy League championships—the Crimson in 2013, 2014, and 2016, and the Tigers in 2012 and 2015. Though Columbia currently leads the conference with 12 points after four games, Princeton is in the mix again with 9. A Harvard win would likely end the Tigers’ push to extend their collective streak to six years.
“We need to be efficient and critical in those key moments,” said Crimson coach Chris Hamblin. “That’s going to be important for us to be successful.”
To end Princeton’s title chances, Harvard will need to contain standout Tigers sophomore forward Abby Givens, who has scored nine goals over the course of the season and leads the team with 22 points. Classmate and fellow forward Courtney O’Brien is not far behind with seven goals.
“We obviously have to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition and put ourselves in the situation where we can figure out the best ways to maximize our ability to get at those weaknesses,” said Hamblin.
Despite the Tigers’ impressive record entering the game, they were shut out by current conference leader Columbia at home last weekend in a 2-0 loss.
Meanwhile, for the Crimson, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi will play an integral role in the offense as usual as she looks to add to her four goals and three assists so far this season. Freshman standout Murphy Agnew, who leads the team with seven assists, will also be looking to add the one assist that will put her at the top of the conference stat board.
Elsewhere, senior midfielder Dani Stollar and sophomore defender Kimaya Cole will look to contain Princeton’s potent attack. But as Hamblin insists, the success this weekend will not be dependent on a few players, but rather on the performance of the team as a whole.
“It’s going to be a collective team effort…everyone needs to play their role,” said Coach Hamblin. “It’s going to be necessary that we attack this game as a group and put our best feet forward as a group.”
This weekend’s contest also marks the 40th anniversary celebration of the squad, a get together  in which decades of alumni of the Harvard women’s soccer program will come together to cheer on current players.
“There is a lot to be proud of in the history of the program,” said Hamblin. “The networking, the family, the support, and the love the alumni have is incredible.”

It’s the wee hours of the morn, and you’re in deep sleep mode. You’re sprawled under the sheets, probably alone, dreaming about six-figure salaries or that one hot TF. Suddenly, all fantasies are shattered as the clanging of bells shakes you awake.
Why do the god-awful bells of Memorial Church ring incessantly every morning at 8:41 a.m.? Before we reveal the truth, here are some alternative conspiracy theories…
Universal Alarm: To avoid rampant absences and lateness, Harvard University decided long ago to ring the bells before 9 a.m. as an underhanded way to wake up groggy freshman and encourage classroom attendance.
John Harvard's Request: Although he didn’t have any children, there had to be a way for him to pass on some type of legacy. So, before dying and donating his property to Harvard, John himself requested the bells ring at this time as a show of tribute.
Remembering Roots: 8:41 a.m. commemorates the time at which Harvard was formally founded by Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1636.
Crazy Tourists: Rubbing John Harvard’s foot isn’t the only way to get some of that ‘Harvard luck’. A new tourist tradition includes visiting Memorial Church right at 8:41 a.m. and ringing the bells as a sign of good (and much cleaner) luck.
Disappointingly, none of the above was the case. But, after some hardcore investigating, Flyby has gotten to the bottom of the question, “What’s Up With the Damn Bells?!”
The Real Explanation: Memorial Church tolls its bells every morning as a call to service for its churchgoers. So the next time you wake up, irritated by the damn bells, silently curse the virtuous church-mice, roll over, and return to your sinful dreams about capitalism (or that hot TF).

This weekend, Cambridge and Boston will once again host the Head of the Charles, a two-day-long celebration of rowing and white people in Patagonias. Thousands of individuals will descend on the banks of the Charles to either spectate or compete in the largest crew competition in the world. If you’re like us and love fried dough, walking around in the dust, and tall people with toned quads, make sure you don’t miss it.
Right now you’re probably asking yourself, “What should I do at an event for a sport that I didn’t even know existed before coming to Harvard?” Don’t worry, Flyby’s got you covered.
Food and goodies
Around the halfway mark of the event, businesses such as Boston Burger Company and Frito-Lay will set up stands to sell (as well as give out) food between JFK St and Weeks Bridge. Overpriced mac and cheese in bread bowls anyone? Other sponsors of the regatta will also be giving out free stuff (hopefully there’s a free fidget spinner or two in the mix). If cookies and cakes are more your thing, The Radcliffe Crew team will be having a bake sale at Weld Boathouse.
Retail therapy
For the bougiest of you, Brooks Brothers will have tents near both the Weld Boathouse and the finish line (past Eliot Bridge on the Boston side), with polo shirts, sweatshirts, bags, and other goodies for sale. Unless you volunteer at the event, you’ll have to shell out close to $400 to get one of the official 2017 Head of the Charles jackets. But don’t worry, there will also be more affordable merchandise sold throughout the race course.
Support your boys and girls in the boats
Those tall specimens in spandex who take all the food in the d-hall are people too, and they would probably appreciate your cheering when they compete this weekend. The men’s and women’s teams combined have entered nearly 20 boats this year, so you can catch them at various times of the day as you eat a burger and flex your new Brooks Brothers gear (and your empty bank account) on the sideline.
All of this crew extravaganza can only be improved by some casual day drinking (although if anyone asks why you’re wandering around the river drunk at 1:48pm, it wasn’t us). Enjoy your weekend, and don’t forget to check back in for our roundup of the event.
