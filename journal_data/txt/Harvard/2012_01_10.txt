I am all about grooving to Rihanna's evocations of a poorly mannered young man's erectile difficulties. But hip-thrusting to "Rude Boy" with 25 middle-aged women at the Alexandria First Presbyterian Church in my small, rural hometown of "No, I Do Not Know Snooki," N.J., seems a little ... incongruous.
Not so during Zumba. When the fitness dance craze swept the nation, it swept me into the multipurpose room of my local church. And there I was on the morning of Christmas Eve, reunited with my favorite two dozen mostly white, almost uniformly middle-aged, and variably overweight ladies, ringing in the holidays with some good-'ol-fashioned booty shaking.
These women—classroom mothers, elementary school teachers, members of the Rosary Society and Ladies t—are not the people you would picture gyrating to reggaeton. But that's what I love about Zumba.
Where else but hometown Zumba can I join my retired high school English teacher—a tiny, flame-haired, flamboyantly Jersey woman—as she "back[s] it up like a Tonka truck;" or witness that church lady, who is roughly 75 years old and skinny as a breadstick, "jiggl[ing] that bit;" or cheer on my friend's mother as she "shake[s] it like a Polaroid picture?"
As the class nears its end, our instructor, Jeanie, whose personality is as peppy as her gluts are toned, pulls me to the front to help lead a song. As Jeanie models the move I am to follow—a pelvic scoop and gyration—I experience a moment of epiphany. My education, at home and school, is fluid: both college and Zumba have taught me a thing or two about hip-thrusting.
The ladies notice. "I'm not sending my daughter to Harvard!," someone shouts amid cheering as the song ends, and I, high on exercise-induced endorphins and the exhilaration of homecoming, return to my spot in the back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
2011 was a big year in Harvard athletics. Women’s soccer captured its third Ivy League championship in four years. The men’s basketball team took home a share of the Ancient Eight title and entered the nation’s Top 25, both firsts in program history. Football set a modern-era program record for points in a season, scoring 374 points en route to a 9-1 finish and a league crown. Four other teams—men’s fencing, men’s heavyweight and lightweight crew, and softball—also finished 2011 on top of the Ivy League standings.
There were a number of standout individual performances as well. Women’s fencer Alexandra Kiefer captured the NCAA Foil Individual title. Men’s basketball forward Keith Wright became just the second player in Harvard history to take home Ivy League Player of the Year honors. Women’s soccer and lacrosse captain Melanie Baskind was named to the First Team All-Ivy in two different sports and was selected as the Ivy League Player of the Year in soccer.
We at The Back Page have taken on the tall task of determining the best Harvard athlete of 2011. Here’s how it will go down: we’ve selected 16 standout Harvard athletes—eight male and eight female—and set up two single elimination brackets. Each round, Harvard’s finest will square off in head-to-head matchups. And based on their performances in 2011, we will determine who advances and who is eliminated until just one male and one female remain. Then, the two champs will square off to determine the top Harvard athlete of 2011.
After examining the matchup between Keith Wright and Matt Jones yesterday, we now turn to a faceoff between football’s Collier Winters and lacrosse’s Dean Gibbons. Check back next week to see the winners of the first-round matchups. 
 
Quarterback Collier Winters—1594 passing yards, 273 rushing yards, 13 touchdown passes, four interceptions
The 2011 season couldn’t have started much worse for senior quarterback Collier Winters. In a 30-22 season-opening loss to Holy Cross, Winters threw two interceptions and suffered an injury that caused him to miss the next month. But after returning for the Crimson’s sixth contest, Winters led a march through the record books. In his first game back, the senior became just the third Harvard gunslinger ever to throw for 400 or more yards in a single contest, and the third to throw five touchdowns in a single game.
The following week, Winters showed his versatility, running for 126 yards in a snow storm against Dartmouth. A dual threat, he continued to terrorize opposing defenses the rest of the way, playing a key role in Harvard’s breaking the modern-era points record and eventually winning the league crown.
In all, despite an injury-shortened, six-game season, Winters threw for 1594 yards, ran for another 273, and completed a remarkable 68.6 percent of his passes en route to a second-team All-Ivy selection.
Attackman Dean Gibbons—30 goals, 29 assists, 59 points
After being named an Inside Lacrosse preseason All-America honorable mention, big things were expected out of Dean Gibbons heading into the 2011 season. And Harvard’s co-captain lived up to, and even eclipsed, those prognostications, being named a midseason All-American by Inside Lacrosse and later leading the Crimson to the Ancient Eight championship game and a No. 15 ranking in the USILA final poll.
In the process, the lefty attackman was a unanimous selection to the All-Ivy first team and was named to the NEILA All-New England first squad as well. He started all 16 games for Harvard, amassing a team-leading 59 points—the ninth most in a season in Crimson history—and was second in the Ivy League and seventh in the nation in points per game (3.69). And Gibbons was at his best when it mattered most. Of his 30 goals, five came in important late-season wins over No. 14 Yale on Senior Day and No. 15 Penn in the Ivy tournament’s first round. Gibbons finished his illustrious career ninth on the Crimson’s all-time scoring list with 155 points and 11th in assists with 63.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WEST LONG BRANCH, N.J.—Things haven’t come easy of late for the No. 25 Harvard men’s basketball team, which has struggled to outplay most of its opponents over the past month. That trend continued Tuesday night, as the Crimson once again found itself in a dogfight against what, on paper, should have been a vastly inferior team.
But just as it has all but twice this year, Harvard (14-2, 1-0 Ivy) emerged with a win, hanging on for a 70-61 victory over Monmouth (3-14, 1-3 NEC) in a game in which the Crimson never trailed but also struggled to find a consistent rhythm.
Just like three-win Dartmouth had two days earlier, the pesky Hawks gave Harvard all it could handle on its home court before the Crimson could pick up its program-record 13th non-conference win.
“We thought they were a lot better than their record indicated, and we knew coming in how difficult this was going to be,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I’m pleased that when the pressure was on for our kids in late-game situations, in making shots and getting stops, we came through.”
Harvard went into the break with a 36-25 lead and opened up a 13-point advantage ninety seconds into the second half after a three by sophomore Laurent Rivard—starting for the first time this season in place of injured junior Christian Webster—and a layup by co-captain Keith Wright.
But from there, Monmouth began to chip away at the Harvard lead, going on a 20-7 run to tie the game at 50 midway through the period. Back-to-back threes by Austin Tillotson and Jesse Steele—who led Monmouth with 16 points—cut the Crimson advantage to four at the 15:30 mark and got the home crowd into the game.
Freshman Wesley Saunders responded with a layup off a great pass from Rivard, but Tillotson then assisted Dion Nesmith on a jumper, and Nesmith returned the favor next time down to cut the lead to 48-46.
“Give them credit,” Wright said. “They played their tails off here. They’re a scrappy team.”
Co-captain Oliver McNally subsequently airballed a long ball at the other end, and Marcus Ware tied the game at 48 for the Hawks with short hook over junior Kyle Casey. After junior guard Brandyn Curry missed a three-point try, Wright grabbed the offensive rebound and found Saunders to give Harvard back the lead. But a Steele layup tied the game again.
“They played incredibly hard,” Amaker said. “Got down double-digits and certainly made a run at it. We had our hands full from tap to buzzer.”
The squads went back-and-forth for the following three minutes, with Monmouth unable to take advantage of a number of chances to pull ahead. A jumper by Mike Myers-Keitt cut the Harvard lead to one at 57-56 with 6:27 to go, but Curry responded with a layup and a three to push the visitors’ lead to six.
McNally took over from there, going a perfect 8-for-8 from the line on Harvard’s next four possessions to ice the Crimson victory down the stretch.
“He’s a guy we want at the foul line in really critical situations,” Amaker said. “Oliver being a senior, being a co-captain and a player that’s done that for us throughout his career—that’s exactly what we wanted.”
Meanwhile, Steele and Nicholas turned the ball over on back-to-back possessions, and the Hawks hit just one more shot from the field—a Steele three—the rest of the way.
“You can’t simulate some of these critical pressure moments in practice,” Amaker said. “Should we be in those positions for a tight, close game? Should we have done things a lot better and sooner to maybe not be in that spot? That’s something we’ll look at and answer honestly, but if we are [in those spots], certainly we want to see if we’re tough enough and have enough composure to make the plays necessary to put us in position to win, and we did that tonight.”
The Crimson had a far easier time in the first half with the Hawks, with three Rivard long balls helping Harvard open up a 16-8 lead early in the game.
“If our three-point shooters are hitting, that’s going to open up things inside for me and vice versa,” Wright said. “When you have that balanced attack, I think we’re a hard team to beat. Laurent hitting those three threes early was huge for us.”
“We haven’t shot the ball particularly well from the perimeter this season,” Amaker added. “To have [Rivard] get some early ones to go down like that I think gave us a great deal of confidence.”
A Ware put-back layup capped a 7-1 Monmouth spurt and tied the contest at 17, but Wright responded with a layup off an offensive rebound and six straight points by freshman forward Steve Mondou-Missi stretched the lead back to 25-19 moments later.
A 7-0 Crimson run later in the half extended the advantage, and Saunders ended the period by driving left baseline, leaping, and finishing over his shoulder with an acrobatic reverse layup to give the Crimson an 11-point lead heading into the break.
“I thought Wes gave us very, very good minutes,” Amaker said. “I thought Steve’s minutes were not many but very efficient while he was in there.”
Wright would finish with his best game of the season, registering 18 points, 15 rebounds, and six blocks one week after struggling to get anything going in the Crimson’s upset loss to Fordham.
“We went inside and were able to score,” said Rivard, who finished with 16 points. “Keith had a really good game; that’s something we didn’t have against Fordham.”
Wright said part of that success came from the inspiration of a former teammate.
“Jeremy Lin [’10] sent me a text after that Fordham game, just reminding me 'you’re a senior, you’re a Player of the Year, you’ve got to attack, you’ve got to play like it,'” Wright said. “That kind of woke me up a bit, just being able to hear him, a guy I respect and look up to a lot—it really changed my mindset. I attacked practice like I did here tonight, and it just carries over.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s hockey team hasn’t been able to find its rhythm in the young 2011-12 campaign, both senior forward Alex Killorn and junior defenseman Danny Biega certainly have. For their play, the two received nominations for the prestigious Hobey Baker Memorial Award.
Given in honor of Hobey Baker, a World War I veteran and a talented amateur athlete at Princeton, the award is given annually to the best player in collegiate hockey, though other attributes, including exemplary character, integrity, sportsmanship, and academic achievement, are taken into consideration.
Killorn and Biega have a tough act to follow. In the past, the Crimson hockey program boasts three Hobey Baker award recipients: Mark Fusco ’83 in 1982-83, Scott Fusco ’85-86 in 1985-86, and Lane MacDonald ’88-89 in 1988-89. Harvard is only behind Minnesota and Minnesota Duluth in the overall number of award recipients.
Killorn, an assistant captain, also received a nomination for the award last season. Through 14 games, Killorn’s 18 points and nine goals are Harvard bests while his .64 goals per game and 1.29 points per game rank 13th and 16th nationally, respectively. Killorn was drafted in the third round of the 2007 NHL Draft by the Tampa Bay Lightning.
Biega, drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in 2010, has 17 points, second in the nation for a defenseman. He leads the Crimson squad with 13 assists, eighth best in collegiate hockey.
At this stage, 77 hockey players have been nominated. 10 finalists will be named on March 15, with the field narrowed to three on March 29. The winner will receive the honor at the Frozen Four Championship on April 6.

This winter I spent my first Christmas in Louisiana, having moved there with my family—proud Ohioans of almost two decades. Like any visitors attempting to understand a new place, we found ourselves near monuments and memorials, necks craned upwards and then quickly downwards as we scanned for plaques and historical explanations. Here are snapshots of what I've learned from a winter on the Bayou.

1. Supposedly, if you take a 360 degree spin around the nine panels that compose the New Orleans Holocaust Memorial, you'll be able to see ten distinct images that tie into the Holocaust and our remembrance of it. As the sun sets on the Mississippi River, the Star of David casts a reminder over the Bayou; nearby on the boardwalk I hear the sound of jazz saxophonists and trumpeters.
 
2. It takes some time to realize that it is Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans and seventh president of the United States, who is on horseback and greeting visitors as they approach the St. Louis Cathedral in the iconic French Quarter. For a time, with my back towards the Mississippi River, I wonder what that guy from my twenty dollar bill is doing as a statue, guarding the place from Disney's "Hunchback of Notre Dame."
 
3. There are two things they love here in Louisiana, I'm starting to gather. The LSU Tigers and Huey Long, aka the Kingfish and former governor of Louisiana. The first is made obvious; vibrant purple flags cover the exteriors of almost every building. It takes a visit to the State Capitol (and resting place of Long), to see the slightly more subtle love that Louisiana has for its early Depression-era politician.
