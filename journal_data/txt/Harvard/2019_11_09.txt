After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He’s back...but you may wish he weren’t.
“Terminator: Dark Fate,” directed by Tim Miller, is the latest installment in the classic sci-fi franchise. Since the film’s announcement in 2017, many have hoped that “Dark Fate” might mark a return to form for the series. (The last three installments have been widely panned.) With original cast members Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton slated to return — as well as creator James Cameron, given story credit alongside Charles Eglee — it seemed to many like the stars had aligned. Alas, fans will be left disappointed — if not infuriated — by “Dark Fate,” which casually undermines the (better) films whose successes it seeks to capitalize on.
“Dark Fate” begins by introducing Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), a Mexican factory worker targeted by the advanced REV-9 (Gabriel Luna) for termination. Sent to protect her is Grace (Mackenzie Davis), a human with cybernetic enhancements, and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the heroine of the original two films. The first act of “Dark Fate” unfolds like a scene-for-scene remake of the 1991 sequel “Terminator 2: Judgment Day”: Grace and the REV-9 arrive from the future and scour the city for Dani, eventually converging in a dramatic fight sequence and car chase. Joined by Sarah, Dani and the REV-9 escape to the outskirts of the city. Despite mutual suspicions, the trio settle into an uneasy alliance and agree to set out for the US-Mexico border. Sound familiar?
The fact that “Dark Fate” is so derivative of “Judgment Day” isn’t itself a problem; after all, the latter film borrowed just as heavily from its predecessor (1984’s “The Terminator”), and it is regarded by many as the best in the series. The unforgivable flaw of “Dark Fate” is its careless treatment of the themes and characters rendered so painstakingly in the original films.
Before going any further, a quick recap: In “The Terminator,” we learn that Sarah’s unborn son John is fated to lead a human resistance against a rogue A.I. called Skynet. On the brink of defeat in 2029, Skynet throws a Hail Mary: It sends a T-800 terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back in time to kill Sarah, thus preventing John’s conception. In “Judgment Day,” the plot is flipped: Sarah and John seek to prevent the “birth” of Skynet by hunting down its creator, a computer scientist named Miles Bennet Dyson. The reversal is brilliant, and it raises the stakes: In “The Terminator,” the best the heroes’ can hope for is a costly human victory in the war against the machines. In “Judgment Day,” John and Sarah are given the chance to prevent the war itself.
“Dark Fate” undoes all that. While fleeing the REV-9, Grace reveals to Sarah that her actions in the previous films successfully prevented the rise of Skynet. Unfortunately, the altered future is not much better: A new computer overlord called Legion, unrelated to Skynet but essentially identical, is hunting humans to extinction. Perhaps there is an endless supply of pseudo-Skynets waiting in the wings...er, alternate timelines. If so, what’s the point of fighting back? The events of the previous films lose all significance.
“Dark Fate” is the latest film to demonstrate the power of sequels to cheapen the classic franchises they aim to reinvigorate. “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015) upset fans for a similar reason: What good was the trilogy-long struggle against the Empire, many asked, if the rebels’ victory gave rise to an even more powerful foe, the First Order? “Independence Day: Resurgence” (2016) and “Incredibles 2” (2018) are two more examples.
This trend is not surprising, given the economic incentives at play: Studios looking for easy returns on intellectual property investments make sequels, and more sequels mean more money. Satisfying, unambiguous conclusions are thus costly in that they preclude future installments.
But there is no justifying the artless, canned quality of these sequels. There seems to be a formula: Take a beloved film (“Judgment Day,” in this case), change its plot superficially, update the visual effects, and infuse it with clumsy (and invariably left-wing) political messaging. “Dark Fate” is full of unsubtle political statements. The film’s first fight sequence, for example, takes place in a factory where workers have just been replaced by industrial robots. (Dani, arriving at work to find her station occupied by machines, asks a supervisor what’s going on. “The future,” he says.) Another fight scene takes place in an I.C.E.-like immigration detention center, the REV-9 having assumed the form of an enforcement officer. Reasonable viewers can disagree about the role of politics in cinema, but there is little excuse for this level of ham-handedness.
The humor of “Dark Fate” is also likely to divide fans. Previous films in the series have experimented with comedy, with some success: In “Judgment Day,” John drills the T-800 on human slang and mannerisms, resulting in some of the series’ most iconic lines (for example, Schwarzenegger’s “Hasta la vista, baby”). In “Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines” (2003), the T-800’s search for clothing leads him to a local bar where a male stripper is performing. When the T-800 demands that he take off his clothes, the stripper mistakes him an overeager member of the audience and tells him to be patient.
But the humor in “Rise of the Machines” proved controversial: Many felt that self-awareness had given way to self-parody. Given this, the decision to double down on the comedy in “Dark Fate” is inexplicable. The T-800 (Schwarzenegger, reprising his role) is not introduced until the second half of the film, and when he does appear, it is in the guise of a drape salesman named Carl. The gag does yield some laughs. At one point, the T-800 gives Sarah advice on picking the right window treatment. “There’s much more to it than just picking the right color,” he says, his voice characteristically monotone. “It’s the texture, the weight of the material. One wrong choice — it can destroy the look of the entire room.” Funny though it may be, the joke feels less welcome the longer it drags on.
“Dark Fate” is entertaining enough if you don’t think too deeply about it. Miller’s direction is fine, and the performances are strong throughout. (Hamilton in particular is excellent, and every bit as compelling as in the first two films). But fans of the series are unlikely to overlook the larger problems at the heart of “Dark Fate,” nor forgive the craven and cynical approach to filmmaking that it represents. When Sarah learns midway through the film that her sabotage of Skynet was a wasted effort, she is understandably dismayed: “Those assholes never learn,” she says. How right she is.

Like the film’s namesake supercars, director James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari” is a monumental technical achievement — a sleek, well-oiled machine of a film that races through its well-paced action. Mangold is perhaps best known in recent years for writing and directing “Logan,” which transcended the superhero genre as a gritty Western that embraced the gore of its R-rated action sequences but also wasn’t afraid to explore its identity as an elegy for aging, sickness, and acceptance. One shouldn’t expect that tone from “Ford v. Ferrari”: it’s a fundamentally different film that’s as industrial as Ford’s factories, but at the same time, it’s hard not to be charmed by the gripping action sequences, strong performances from Christian Bale and Matt Damon, and a riveting (if contrived) central theme of ambition.
Despite what its title suggests, "Ford v Ferrari" isn't a movie about two warring multi-billion dollar car companies; it's about two individuals intensely passionate about racing, and how they balance their friendship and determination to fulfill their singular ambition. The narrative follows hot-head British driver Ken Miles (Bale) and former racing champion Carroll Shelby (Damon), who's forced to retire from racing due to health concerns. When Ford decides it needs to take on industry giant Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race to add some much-needed prestige to their faltering brand name, company executives enlist the help of Shelby and Miles to attain what corporate funds can’t buy — a roaring heart to match Ferrari's herculean engines.
Bale is predictably scene-stealing as the wise-cracking, sarcastic Miles, and Damon is a fitting counterpart as the strong-willed Shelby, but their character arcs don't always feel natural, and their chemistry seems more reliant on the actors' skills rather than on the lackluster script. “Ford v Ferrari” also stumbles into uneven pacing in the film’s first act, especially with Miles’ family scenes, which distract from an otherwise well focused plot with forgettable characters and trite interactions.
"Ford v Ferrari" really takes off as a cinematic experience with its action scenes; when the audience is behind the wheel with Miles, the film launches into a propulsive, nonstop stratosphere of blissful entertainment. It’s difficult to capture the notion of relative speed on film, but cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, who collaborated with Mangold on “Walk the Line,” imbues the racing scenes with a trademark dynamic energy. He grounds the camera with low-angle shots close to the road with a combination of zooms, tracking shots, and point of view shots that vitalize the cars' unbridled power on the track. Even subtle choices, like panning in both directions (right-to-left and left-to-right) instead of just one prevents the race sequences from feeling repetitive. Moreover, the smooth edits peppering sequences with the occasional wide shot lends a sense of grandeur and perspective.
The sound design of the film is also notably meticulous; it takes in the sounds of the racetrack from the engine, to the spectators, to sound effects, and dialogue, and is somehow able to distill all of it to focus on what’s important in the right moments of the story. Through all this cacophony, Mangold finds a way to track a riveting score on top of it with strong rhythmic music from Marco Beltrami (“Logan” and “A Quiet Place”) that sustains the film’s expeditious pace.
While the script neglects to fully develop its characters, it at least handles the exposition of the racing scenes with care, because how can audiences follow an action sequence if they can’t understand it? The script integrates information at a pace that keeps viewers from feeling overwhelmed, but by the end, makes them feel at home in this highly specialized sports world.
In a year where millions of unfortunate audiences flocked to see the monstrosity that was “Hobbs and Shaw” (another car-based action film), “Ford v Ferrari” can afford to be refreshing without being groundbreaking. Mangold gifts audiences with a sublimely immersive, high-octane action film that sits comfortably near the top the year’s very best. "Ford v Ferrari" finds its soul through the unwavering dedication of the men who risked their lives and livelihoods every day for what they loved. That passion is contagious, and part of the reason why the action sequences are so enjoyable. On a technical standpoint, “Ford v Ferrari” is streamlined to perfection with incredible editing and camera work; it’s a lot of flash with not as much substance, but if the flash is this bright, who cares?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a game that came down to the wire, the Crimson’s spirited second-half comeback attempt fell just short.
On the road for the first time this season, Northeastern handed Harvard its first defeat off of a record-setting 44-point effort from captain Jordan Roland.
Still without senior point guard Bryce Aiken (who is day-to-day with a calf injury) and senior forward Seth Towns (who is still rehabbing a knee injury), the Crimson went into Matthews Arena with the formidable task of upending a tough Huskies team that it had fallen to last year.
As was the case in its last game against MIT, Harvard’s performance was a tale of two halves. The team only had 27 points in the first period and shot 39 percent from the floor, while giving up 63 percent shooting to Northeastern. In the second half, despite scoring nearly twice as many points and shooting at a 54 percent clip, the team could not make up for the 17-point deficit entering halftime.
“I thought their first half performance, getting us in a hole right out of the blocks, was a huge difference in the game,” coach Tommy Amaker said. “We talked about getting off to a better start and it didn’t go that way.”
The Crimson had the unenviable job of figuring out how to defend senior guard Jordan Roland, who just scored 39 points on 15-of-24 shooting against Boston University in the Huskies’ season opener. The Syracuse, N.Y. native notched 35 against Harvard last season and continued to have his way against the Crimson defense throughout the game, finishing with a career-high and school-record 44 points.
“Certainly, the effort by Roland was outstanding this game, like he was the previous game against BU,” Amaker said. “[He is] a tremendous threat and player all over the floor, and played a full 40 minutes without ever looking like he was sweating or tired. Just an outstanding performance by that team and by that kid in particular.”
In the early minutes of the game, Roland immediately made his presence felt by scoring 11 straight points to start the game including three triples, giving Northeastern an early 11-2 lead. He would continue to be a scoring threat throughout the first half, ending with 20 points in the frame.
Even when Roland wasn’t scoring, the Huskies continued to capitalize on his penetration, leading to open three opportunities for his teammates throughout the first period. The lead would balloon to double digits in the first three minutes of the game and remained that way for the rest of the first half.
 In the second half, the Crimson changed the momentum of the game with better perimeter shooting and reduced turnovers. After being outscored in the field by 18 points in the first half, Harvard limited Northeastern to only three triples in the second period.
“We honestly thought at the half we should get our confidence and our hope up,” Amaker said. “We certainly hoped they wouldn’t shoot as well as they did in the first half, and we talked about that, stayed with our discipline, stayed with our game plan, [and] stayed with our coverages ... I’m pleased we were able to cut down the turnovers from the previous game, especially as something that bothered us last season.”
The team came in with a renewed energy and would go on an 18-3 run that would ignite its comeback. The bench scoring of sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood and junior forward Danilo Djuricic — who contributed a combined 27 points — was integral towards the Crimson’s efforts at counteracting the Huskies’ hot scoring.
“We did a tremendous job of fighting our way back and we talked at halftime about making sure we were going to fight and we were going to play with intelligence,” Amaker said. “And we thought if we did those two things we might have a chance at making a run at it. I was very pleased and proud of that.”
Nevertheless, Northeastern did not collapse and managed to close out the game thanks to consistent scoring from Roland and critical free throws down the stretch. The Huskies star continued where he left off in the first half, tallying 24 in the second period and hitting clutch baskets down the stretch.
Freshman guard Tyson Walker also contributed 15 points for the Huskies while junior guard Myles Franklin drained the game-clinching free throws with just over twenty seconds left to win the game for Northeastern.
Harvard will continue its non-conference slate on Sunday as it returns to Lavietes Pavilion to face Maine in a heavily-favored matchup for the Crimson.

With under a minute left to play, sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy dished a backdoor pass to sophomore forward Tess Sussman, who laid the ball in off the glass. The Friday night crowd at Lavietes Pavilion cheered as McCarthy and Sussman embraced at half court, while a demoralized University of California at Berkeley team called a timeout to regroup.
Sussman’s layup solidified Harvard’s lead against the Bears as the Crimson successfully mounted a 56-53 comeback win in its home opener. The game marked Harvard’s second consecutive victory over Cal.
To senior co-captain and guard Mackenzie Barta, back-to-back victories over the Bears is no small feat.
“It’s huge. Beating them once is like, okay, it could have been a fluke. We just had a good shooting night. They maybe didn't play their best,” Barta said. “But beating them twice. I think it's a statement.”
The Crimson’s “statement” victory, however, was far from inevitable. In fact, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith called Friday night’s victory an “ugly game.”
“I couldn't be more proud of this team, because I don't think we did a lot of things well, other than play our hearts out on the defensive end,” she said.
Early in the first quarter, Harvard got out ahead, but California chipped at the Crimson’s lead, hitting a fluke three point shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 14 going into the second quarter.
California’s man-to-man defense stifled Harvard’s players. Repeatedly, the Crimson players were forced to throw up desperate attempts to score as the shot clock wound down to its last seconds. In the second quarter, Cal held Harvard to score only five points and led by 10 at the halftime intermission.
Harvard’s weak offense was compounded by turnovers. The squad looked out of synch; at their worst, players were unable to complete passes to each other under the slightest defensive pressure. As a result, Harvard ended the first half with a whopping 15 turnovers.
“Inexperience was our demon,” Delaney-Smith said. “We're either young or coming back from an injury. So everything we're doing is rusty. And I expect it to be ugly, because we don't know each other very well on the offensive end..there's no quick road to experience.”
Though the team lacks experience, it oozes with character.
“There's such heart and selflessness on this team right now. It's very selfless. I felt it since we started practice,” Delaney-Smith said.
This selflessness was vital to the Crimson’s comeback effort in the second half. It manifested in critical plays down the stretch, like the back door pass from McCarthy to Sussman.
“Maggie and Tess didn’t play a lot last year. And now they’re the heart and rock of our team. They’re both phenomenal players,” Delaney-Smith said.
On offense, Sussman added fuel to the Crimson’s comeback effort. Twice in the fourth quarter, from the position of right wing, the versatile guard/forward drove middle past her defender and finished at the hoop with her left hand to tie the game. Sussman finished with 13 points, 5 rebounds, 2 blocks, and 2 steals.
Though McCarthy does not usually play point guard, she looked like a floor general in Friday’s game. The guard was ubiquitous on the court; she chased down rebounds, tussled on the ground to get possession of the ball, and swarmed her opponents by playing help defense. McCarthy made herself essential to the Crimson on both ends of the floor, tallying 38 minutes of game time play. In that time, she grabbed 7 rebounds, dished 3 assists, and scored 4 points.
“She's become our floor leader,” Barta said. McCarthy is “doing all of the...intangible things, and I know that might not show up on the scoresheet, but we definitely all appreciate it. I think she's one of the most gritty players that we have for sure, very consistent too.”
In addition to the sophomores, standout freshman guard Lola Mullaney led both teams in scoring with 14 points in only three quarters. Her prolific scoring performance was cut short due to an ankle injury that forced her to be carried off the court by her teammates. Despite her injury, Mullaney made a statement of her own in her Harvard debut against Northern Illinois on Tuesday by scoring 25 points.
The second leading scorer for the Crimson was senior forward Jeannie Boehm. Boehm, who grinded in the post against Cal’s formidable forwards, scored 10 points. Though she looked frustrated in the first half, she came out determined in the second half, scoring buckets in the paint to give the Crimson needed momentum.
Senior co-captain Mackenzie Barta recorded the first double-double of her career. In 32 minutes of play, she grabbed 12 rebounds and scored 10 points. 
Missing from the team’s lineup in the Crimson’s first two games of the season is junior forward Jadyn Bush. Bush, who led the Crimson in rebounds last year, is recovering from a shoulder surgery she underwent in the offseason. Delaney-Smith is confident that Bush will be back in the rotation by the time Harvard begins its league play.
Barta said Friday night’s win was a testament to the team’s mentality this season.
“The team culture, I don't know how to explain it, but it's different,” she said. “It's new, it's fresh. I think we're ready to do big things this year. It's gritty. That's my word of the day. Grit. This team has a lot of grit.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team hopes to complete its first four-point weekend of the young season when it welcomes Quinnipiac to its home barn on Saturday. The No. 18/15 Crimson (2-0-0, 2-0-0 ECAC) skated past Princeton, 3-0, last night and remains unbeaten. Meanwhile on Friday, the No. 15/- Bobcats battled Dartmouth to a draw and will look to return to the win column, posing Harvard's most formidable threat to date.
In two games this season, sophomore defenseman Jack Rathbone leads the Crimson in scoring with five points (2–3—5), with rookie winger Nick Abruzzese (2–2—4) and junior center Jack Badini (1–3—4) also playing a large role in the group's attack. Between the pipes, first-year Mitchell Gibson (1-0-0, 0.00 GAA, 1.000 SV%) should tend the net after posting a shutout victory in his debut on Friday evening.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Saturday night’s duel between the Harvard men’s hockey team (3-0-0, 3-0-0 ECAC) and conference foe Quinnipiac (4-4-1, 0-1-1), the No. 18/15 Crimson built leads and defended them. The No. 15 Bobcats responded to Harvard’s surges with early-period goals in both the second and third frames, but the hosts were able to mitigate the comeback efforts and secure the 7-2 victory.
The Crimson's 3-0-0 start to the campaign is the best it has posted in the 16-season tenure of coach Ted Donato '91.
“It’s good to see our depth clicking right now,” sophomore forward Casey Dornbach said. “It’s good to see us able to get off to a good start…. We know every one of these [standings] points, especially at home, is huge. In the ECAC and the Ivy, one point at the end of the year can mean everything.”
Harvard owned the lead for most of the game thanks to its solid first period which included three tallies. The ice tilted back to even in the middle frame, as Quinnipiac quickly cut its deficit to two scores.
In the waning minutes of the second, however, the Crimson put home two pucks and rendered the contest out of reach for the Bobcats.
First, slippery skating and puck-handling from freshman forward Nick Abruzzese created a weak-side chance on which Dornbach capitalized. Just several shifts later, rookie defenseman Henry Thrun flipped the puck over goaltender Evan Fear on the rush. The strike, which was upheld after video review for an offsides call, put a comfortable distance of four pucks between the two ECAC adversaries.
In the third, Harvard added another two goals to Quinnipiac’s one, but the result was inevitable after the Crimson doled the deflating two-score blow at the end of the second period.
“We gave up a goal early, and we were able to hold them off,” freshman forward John Farinacci said. “That second period was all over the place with all the penalties. It was definitely good to get a couple goals at the end of the second, but…we still had to come out and have a good first five and finish it off.”
To close out the first frame, sophomore forward R.J. Murphy found twine for the first time this season and extended the advantage to three. Senior Justin Szeto earned his first career point on the play, as he slipped a pass to Murphy from behind the net to set up the strike.
Murphy’s tuck turned out to be the game-winner in Saturday’s clash and was just one element of a strong opening 20 for the crimson and white. It was also a prime example of the healthy contributions Harvard received from skaters throughout the lineup.
“What’s a real positive for me is that we’re getting contributions up and down the lineup,” coach Donato said. “When you have guys step up and make plays like that, it really gives a lot of confidence on the bench.”
Twelve minutes into the tilt, the referees assessed Quinnipiac blue-liner Peter DiLiberatore a five-minute major penalty and game misconduct for hitting Harvard’s Jack Badini from behind. One minute into the ensuing non-releasable powerplay, the home team converted its first man-up marker of the season, courtesy of center Jack Drury.
With a spinning backhand pass, junior point man Reilly Walsh worked the puck down near the goal line to Dornbach. The sophomore found his classmate at the top of the right circle, where Drury ripped a one-timer over the left pad of Bobcats goaltender Keith Petruzzelli to give his team a two-score lead.
“[The powerplay] is something we have to clean up a little bit,” Dornbach said. “But it’s good to see us getting offense in multiple ways.”
The major penalty played a significant role in tilting the ice in the Crimson’s favor through 20 minutes. The squad’s first-period performances in its two games leading up to Saturday left something to be desired — defensive-zone turnovers and a subsequent failure to possess the puck in the offensive zone defined these two opening frames. Against Quinnipiac, though, Harvard thoroughly dominated the tilt’s incipient stanza.
“Quinnipiac is notoriously one of the best teams in the neutral zone…and they’re a really good transition team, so you have to be good with the puck,” coach Donato said. “I thought we were better with the puck today, and I thought we were able to get some pucks in their zone and get plays stopped up and use all five guys offensively.”
Looking to ignite his group, Bobcats coach Rand Pecknold replaced Petruzzelli (3 GA, .571 SV%) with Fear (4 GA, .750 SV%) when the teams rejoined for the middle frame.
Quinnipiac responded before the period was two minutes old. Sophomore forward Wyatt Bongiovanni fired one past freshman net-minder Mitchell Gibson (2 GA, .941 SV%) on a successfully executed faceoff play. The goal marked the first blemish on Gibson’s young but promising NCAA resume.
So initially, the goalie swap seemed to work — that is, until the Crimson’s late-second-period surge.
Junior forward Henry Bowlby broke open the scoring in Saturday’s affair. The Harvard winger darted through the slot and picked up a feed from Murphy before placing the puck right under the bar on Petruzzelli.
The tally added to Bowlby’s productive weekend (2–1—3), as well as to Murphy’s career-best night (1–1—2). Early in the campaign, Bowlby has shown that his top-end speed will be an asset for the Crimson all year.
Bowlby and Murphy are two of the many significant Harvard contributors through three contests this season. Abruzzese (2–4—6), Dornbach (1–5—6), and sophomore blue-liner Jack Rathbone (3–3—6) sit tied for the team lead in points. Dornbach’s three-point effort on Saturday paced all skaters. Badini (1–4—5), Farinacci (2–3—5), and Thrun (2–2—4) have also played large roles in the high-octane Crimson offense through the squad’s first two weekends. All six of these impact players inked the score sheet on Saturday night.
After a four-point weekend, Harvard’s national ranking is set to improve by next week, when it will hit the road for the first time this season for Ivy League rivals Brown and Yale.
The schedule ahead will provide more adversity than the undefeated Crimson has seen to date, but the team’s young, skilled core has assimilated quickly to college hockey and should continue to deliver ample firepower moving forward.
