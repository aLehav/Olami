After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the worst recession in decades, budget cuts are both necessary and expected. Even in the proverbial “Ivory Tower,” sacrifices must be made, and these sacrifices will test the resilience of the Harvard community in weathering such a formidable economic storm. Certainly, the course on which this university is about to embark will not be an entirely pleasant one. From the perspective of the student body alone, these budget cuts will often negatively impact student life, but they must be endured as they come. Although we understand the necessity of these budget cuts, there is a right way and a wrong way to arrive at these difficult decisions. Unfortunately, the university’s recent actions embody the wrong way—lacking, as is all too typical, in transparency. The planned cuts, including hot breakfast, late-night weekday Quad shuttle service, and the Hilles Library, seem to have been made without adequate student consultation.Given the uproar heard around campus over several of these cuts, it seems many student considerations were not fully thought through by administrators. Moreover, students were understandably taken aback by these cuts. Before cutting hot breakfast, athletes who rely on these meals should have been consulted. Before cutting shuttle service or the Quad Library, Quad students should have had a period to offer feedback. When finalized decisions are made without any prior effort of communication, this leave students feeling alienated and the administration seeming disconnected and disengaged with student life.To avoid situations like this from happening again in the future, especially given the promise of further cuts on the horizon, it seems prudent to offer more opportunities for student input before decisions are made. While we appreciate the initiative several students have taken in planning the “We Are Harvard” rally this coming Tuesday—with the very appropriate tagline of “students, staff, and faculty for transparency and inclusion in budget cuts”—ultimately, the responsibility for starting these conversations lies with the administration, not with students. The recent commotion caused by these cuts could have been avoided by soliciting respectful student input before these cuts were finalized. Had it widely publicized its cut proposals beforehand, FAS could have easily refined its plan as holes and concerns were uncovered.We certainly do not believe that student opinion should dictate the university’s budgeting decisions—there is information we do not know and particular circumstances we do not entirely understand. But the administration should certainly consider student concerns more actively when making decisions, especially when these decisions directly affect student life. We hope that  , in the future, the administration starts this important dialogue much earlier.

In the recent round of budget cuts, the administration seemingly forgot to include student safety in their cost-benefit analysis. During these tough economic times, it is understandable that FAS must cut a number of costs to preserve Harvard’s solvency, but the move to dramatically reduce shuttle service is an especially poor choice for a cut, as it severely compromises student safety for an incommensurate financial gain. The proposed cuts to night shuttle service create a variety of hazards and constraints in the lives of students, as do the inconvenient cuts to morning service on weekends. 
While the administration contends that shuttle use during the hours of service reduction is light, when the issue of student safety is on the table, cuts should not just be evaluated by how many students ride the shuttle at certain times, but also by the importance of shuttle travel for the well-being of individual students.
The night service cuts present a clear danger to every student in the Quad, as walking to the Quad late at night through Cambridge Common is an unsafe proposition, as evidenced by recent safety incidents in the area.  There have already been enough crimes in Cambridge Common for the UC to request additional safety measures for the area. Given the danger of braving the Common, the shuttle cuts present a significant constraint in the lives of Quad students. 
Quadlings should not have to choose between working on a group project with friends who live on the River and coming home safely, or running a quality student group event and coming home safely, or just working late in Lamont and coming home safely. The shuttle cuts have the potential to not only restrict these pursuits, but also to increase the incidence of students feeling pressured to stay in others’ rooms or being unable to leave a situation that makes them uncomfortable. 
In reaction to the outcry over safety, the administration has presented the escort and van services as alternative transport options. These, however, are not currently viable substitutes for shuttle service, due to their slow and unreliable response times. In addition, the escort service only operates until 2:00 a.m. on Sunday through Wednesday nights, just 30 minutes later than the new shuttle schedule will end, and the van service stops taking calls at 2:30. The shuttle in its current form is the only dependable and safe method for traveling home at any hour of the night. 
The cuts to the weekend morning service will also have a negative impact on the lives of Quad students. Athletes facing early practices will have to brave hazardous and icy conditions for many months of the year. Students going to morning religious services on the weekend will face similar challenges, as the shuttle will not start until 12:15, when many services will already be done.
There are already concerns about housing inequity on campus, as many students dread being “Quadded” when Housing Day comes around. The last thing we need is to add a fear for their own safety into the life of Quad students. The shuttle cuts create substantial dangers during the nighttime and inconvenience at all hours. In reaction to the outrage over these shuttle cuts during the town-hall meetings, the administration promised to reevaluate the plan. We hope they follow through and repeal this dangerous decision.

And so, without fail, it began once again—the flurry of e-mails hit the Eliot House list. With the famed Fete only days away, Eliot students of all classes, from rising sophomores through soon-to-be-graduating seniors, began posting their formal tickets for sale, along with desired prices. While the occasional solicitor lamented his or her inability to make the end-of-year ball, munificently allowing some layman the chance to enter the white tent in his or her place, more and more of the e-mails appeared to be planned and timed in advance. Deadlines of when last offers could be made on tickets, starting bidding levels preset for the buying audience, and offers to sell made less than 24 hours before the dance were among the signs that many students had calculated their sales to rake up the maximum profit. The e-mail list quickly became an eBay list.
While the Fete is particularly renowned, other formals on campus—including the freshman formal—draw similar patterns of behavior. With money to be made, more and more people seem to be looking forward to the green, not the gala. You don’t need to be an economics concentrator versed in game theory to understand demand; with friends from other houses, seniors trying to get to that elusive 12th formal, and guests visiting from out of town, there will always be people clamoring for admission. Buying formal tickets simply to sell them, however, is a cynical money-making enterprise, a watering down of house spirit, and a disincentive to actually attend the event. Expectations are set unrealistically high when a hefty sum is put down for a ticket, with people sourly wondering, “I paid $90 for this?”
Much like community dinners, barbecues, and stein clubs, formals provide a culminating opportunity to eat from chocolate fountains, renew your yearly account with Keezer’s, and enjoy a night with your fellow Housemates. Formals need not be entirely House-exclusive, but people from that house should make up the bulk of the crowd. It’s a chance for new members of the House to meet and get acquainted with their soon-to-be neighbors and for everybody else to renew their House pride. When House formals are sold out to the highest bidder, they revert back to being regular weekend parties, with the uniting factor being fancy attire, not residential allegiance. Formals are best when you can wake up the next day and have brunch with those same revelers in your own dining hall.
Equally disconcerting is the trend of students looking to sell tickets before they even consider going themselves. A vicious cycle has been created in which, before people can even get excited by the invitations posted to their door, they are bombarded with offers and flashing-light e-mails for tickets to buy. Open markets: great. Free country: fantastic. But if people are not able or do not want to go to their formal, then they should be given their dues back, rather than make a profit, because the House Committee has put a lot of time into creating a great event. Those tickets that aren’t taken can be put up in a raffle or lottery like any other high-demand event, with profits going to the House for future events.
Ultimately, the part I regret most is not that my Housemates are making money off the Fete, but that they themselves didn’t attend. Well, there’s always next year.

In the 1960s, most of America reviled Malcolm X as a villain.  America now celebrates the May 19 birthday of this “shining prince.”
History repeats itself.  On April 22, 2004, an American football star named Pat Tillman was killed in action in Afghanistan.  After September 11, Tillman had eschewed a $3.6 million sports contract to volunteer for the Army Rangers.  Selfless and ruggedly handsome, he could have played himself in the Hollywood movie about his life—had he not been shot by his own troops.  On April 28, Rene Gonzalez, a political science graduate student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, objected to calling Tillman a war hero, pointing out in an essay that this “anti-hero” had not died defending his own country from invasion but had instead volunteered to kill other men in theirs.
Within two days, death threats forced Gonzalez to go into hiding.  Websites went up with his personal details—e-mail accounts, telephone numbers, his home address.   Even Paul Begala, the supposedly liberal former advisor to U.S. President Bill Clinton, urged CNN viewers to send letters critical of Gonzalez to The Daily Collegian, the student newspaper that had published the essay. Instead of defending one of his students from terrorist threats, university president Jack Wilson called Gonzalez’s essay “a disgusting, arrogant and intellectually immature attack on a human being who died in service to his country.”  Without a trace of irony, Wilson added, “We are fortunate that so many people like Pat Tillman have made the sacrifices necessary to protect the free speech rights of Mr. Gonzalez.”
Performing last rites on the First Amendment, that part of the Bill of Rights that protects free speech, the Massachusetts legislature officially condemned Gonzalez in a resolution.  Gonzalez soon apologized.
All that Gonzalez should have apologized for was confusing Pat Tillman with “Pat Tillman,” the creature constructed by the U.S. Army out of dead men’s flesh like Frankenstein’s monster.  “Pat Tillman” was a “caricature,” as Tillman’s mother Mary put it, as unfamiliar to her as the square-jawed photograph broadcast to the nation by the military after Tillman’s death, a portrait that Mary had never seen before and that Pat said he did not like. 
“Pat Tillman” was a God-fearing überpatriot.  But Pat Tillman, the long-haired  atheist, wanted to meet Noam Chomsky, the distinguished MIT professor and anti-war writer, a “favorite author” of Pat’s, according to his mother.  Pat Tillman considered as his “hero” Rachel Corrie, a peace activist crushed to death when she placed herself—living Mario Savio’s words—between a bulldozer and a home.  And, according to Tillman’s friend, Army Spec. Russell Baer, “Pat said, ‘You know, this war is so f***ing illegal.’…  He totally was against Bush.”
The irony is that, despite the outrage expressed ostensibly on the Tillman family’s behalf, Tillman’s mother told me she had never read Gonzalez’s essay.   Tillman’s brother, Kevin, also an Army Ranger, unknowingly echoed Gonzalez when he wrote, in 2006, “Somehow American leadership, whose only credit is lying to its people and illegally invading a nation, has been allowed to steal the courage, virtue, and honor of its soldiers on the ground.”
The part of the American leadership in Massachusetts should now apologize.  Not just to Rene Gonzalez, but to all Americans: those who fell on the battlefield—their coffins hidden from view like someone’s mad aunt in the attic—and those who fell victim to right-wing hate-mongering.  
America’s “digital brownshirts” (a term coined by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore) have “Dixie Chicked” many. But with 62 percent of Americans thinking the Iraq War was a mistake in 2006, and George W. Bush’s popularity at the close of his presidency only 22 percent, it now appears that Rene Gonzalez was ahead of his time.  While many still morally distinguish Iraq and Afghanistan, Gonzalez’s majority of one in 2004 became the Democratic majority in 2009.
Five years and zero weapons of mass destruction later, one could view Gonzalez as an anti-war hero. Maybe even Pat Tillman would have agreed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, Harvard University Dining Services removed its customary nutrition fact cards from the dining halls, citing concerns from President Drew G.  Faust and other university administrators about the cards’ impact on students with eating disorders. After other concerned students protested that the new policy deprived them of necessary nutritional knowledge, HUDS provided information through alternative methods. While the new HUDS policy is a reasonable compromise between the debating parties, HUDS must continue to make every effort to provide as much nutrition information to the students. To that end, our dining halls should avoid any further attempts to proscribe the dissemination of valuable nutritional information.
When considering what policies to institute for student health, the needs of nutritional minorities should be considered. Crista Martin, the HUDS spokesperson, put it best when she explained that, “for people who have eating disorders or who struggle with issues around the literal value of food, the emphasis on nutrition information does not always lead people to eat in a healthy manner.” But the policy that followed Martin’s announcement was neither fair nor sensible. Food nutrition information was only available on HUDS’s website and some scattered dining-hall kiosks after it had been removed. 
The new policy soon attracted criticism from various sources. In response, HUDS administrators announced the formation of a new committee, comprised of representatives from University Heath Services, Residential Life, the Bureau of Study Counsel, and Eating Concerns Hotline Outreach. This body continued to review the labeling decision and eventually decided to provide a permanent, single-page printout of nutrition information at all dining stations where the core items remain constant—such as the salad bar, deli, bread box, and cereal dispensers.
While it was heartening to see the committee continue deliberations regarding the best approach to the release of nutrition information, students should have had more of a role in the process. To be fair, the committee did invite students to contact committee members, but there should have been a more proactive outreach campaign in order to facilitate student interaction. College students ought to be provided with as much information regarding health matters as possible. Therefore, maximizing the dissemination of information ought to be made the highest priority. 
It is also heartening to see that the administration is keeping school politics out of the nutrition-fact deliberations. Administrators have the Harvard student body’s health as the highest priority when making their judgments. In addition to the administration, there are many students who voice their opinions on the subject. It may seem that the subject would not cause much student debate, but, in fact, students debate with one another on the nutrition policies. It is important for HUDS and the committee to understand that the general population of students at Harvard do care about the nutrition card issue.
Increasing the amount of information available to HUDS’s customers would also mirror important trends in public health legislation. New York City has adopted calorie-disclosure regulations that force many restaurants to post calorie information wherever the restaurant lists the information that customers use to make their choices. In a New York Times interview, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city’s health commissioner, remarked “most people underestimate calorie content by a lot” and added that he considered the rules a potent weapon in the crusade against rising obesity rates. At the other end of the spectrum, individuals who have slow metabolisms or suffer from compulsive eating disorders should have nutritional information readily available in order to help them moderate their caloric intake.
Though the placement of nutrition facts is a very serious issue, one place where they should have remained in the open is at the dessert table. Common sense dictates that desserts should be consumed in moderation. Placing calorie counts next to desserts should not be observed as a paternalistic action of imposing guilt upon diners, but rather a disclosure of nutritional content of an extra meal option. 
Ultimately, nutrition information should be considered first and foremost as information. In principle, information should be as accessible as possible so that students can make well-informed decisions. Following this line of reasoning, it is important that HUDS make every effort to provide as much nutrition information as possible to students at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We all recognize that we are in a recession. We are prepared to say goodbye to hot breakfast and farewell to the Quad Library. Where unnecessary spending is taking place, we respect the administration’s decision to make cuts. However, the cost of ensuring Harvard students’ safety is not “unnecessary spending.”  Student safety should never be a bullet point between “Scan and Deliver Service” and “Telecommunications Management” on a list of “cost saving measures.” While it may seem as though only a portion of students are affected by this cut, the impact on the lives of Quad residents is significant enough to warrant the attention of the Harvard community. This is not an issue of convenience; this is an issue of safety.
To suggest that we stop whining and start walking is fine during daylight hours. But we constantly receive Community Advisories from the Harvard University Police Department that alert us to the rising rates of violent crime against both men and women in the area. Therefore, walking to and from the Quad through Cambridge Common, an area recognized as dangerous, is not a safe option at night. Already, the current nighttime shuttle schedule is less than ideal. 
The recently announced budget cuts and shuttle changes raise many issues relating to Quad safety. However, there is a further issue involving the safety of Quad women that is inherently less obvious due to its sensitive and personal nature. Last week, the conversation among many Quad women revolved around this related issue, and, after hearing these similar stories and speaking with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, we felt compelled to raise this point.   
Many of the stories we have heard address similar situations: A woman who lives in the Quad is ready to go home. She has missed the 2:45 a.m. shuttle, and the next does not come until 3:15 a.m. From previous experience, she knows that the evening van service will tell her to wait for the next shuttle. When weighing her options, she cannot just walk home, but among her choices is an offer from a male who says she can wait for the shuttle in his room. The offer is probably innocent, and the woman probably gets on the next shuttle as planned. However, we have been made aware of many situations in which the events that follow are far from harmless. This woman is forced to make a decision she would have never considered if she’d merely lived close enough to just end her night when she wanted. 
In no way are we suggesting that every male or every River resident is a sexual predator. Nor do we suggest that these compromising situations only occur by the river and involve women who live in the Quad. But we’ve heard this same story from many different women, all who have felt stranded by the river when they would prefer to go home. Women should be able to end their nights safely whenever they want, not just on the :15 and :45 shuttles.
It’s unfortunate that it took budget cuts to bring these stories to light. But, now that we’ve heard them, we can’t ignore them. We have a responsibility to share this issue on behalf of the women who understandably did not feel comfortable speaking up over their House lists or at the town-hall forums with Dean Evelynn Hammonds. 
Reducing shuttle service will only make this worse. The university evening van service is not the answer because it often turns down student requests or offers wait times of over 30 minutes. What we need is a safe, reliable, and free alternative to provide transportation to Quad students at night.   
Harvard is full of brilliant minds and creative thinkers. While it would have been preferable for the administration to ask for student feedback before these announced changes, it is still worthwhile to solicit solutions or compromises that will keep students safe within budgetary restrictions. Despite the outcry on campus through private and public e-mails from students, parents, faculty, and alumni, as yet, a week after the announced cuts, we have received no sign that the administration is listening. MIT is leading a similar budget-cut initiative and is trying to incorporate community feedback, even streamlining the process of recognizing the best ideas. Its website asks the MIT community to post suggestions to the “Idea Bank” and allows others to view these responses and rate the ones they find “particularly innovative and practicable.” Harvard should offer a similar forum to encourage the most creative, realistic, and responsible solutions possible.  
If given adequate time and a forum for feedback, we do not doubt that the Harvard community could generate less expensive and even safer solutions to the dangers posed by the nighttime commute to the Quad. But to make cuts to an already imperfect shuttle system without having first established a safe alternative is beyond irresponsible. It is a reckless decision that will cut financial costs at the expense of student safety, and this is not a deal that anyone should be willing to accept.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard begins to confront its most severe budgetary and financial contraction in a generation, administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have unveiled $77 million of budget cuts, slashing everything from paid consultants to hot breakfast in the dining halls. FAS leaders should be lauded for making serious budget cuts, given that many of them will be painful. However, a number of the small cuts—notably the significant reductions in Harvard’s shuttle service to the Radcliffe Quadrangle and the layoffs of House-based administrative staff—would save only a small amount of money while having a disproportionately negative impact on the lives of many undergraduates.
Still, it is neither serious nor intellectually honest to point out problems with the proposed cuts without providing alternatives. In fact, when FAS administrators presented their plans at a public forum in Quincy House, they seemed to invite—albeit with a hint of defensiveness—suggestions about other cuts, an invitation that came after a student asked why top administrators are not taking pay reductions.
Having spent several hours both studying the structure of FAS and the College and conducting private interviews with administrators, it’s clear to me that there is a significant amount of dead wood in both organizations, most of it in the areas that have seen the most staff growth in recent years. Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith—who, it must be said, is responsible for quite a bit of this bureaucratic overgrowth—should strongly consider laying off some of the following staff before he implements cuts that would have a considerably more adverse effect on students.
First, as it already seems to be doing, the College could cut staff from the Advising Programs Office, which has grown considerably in just the past few years. Associate Dean of Advising Programs Monique Rinere, who was hired from Princeton and is leaving for Columbia, is responsible for much of this aimless expansion. The College is making the right decision in keeping her position vacant. Likewise, at least three of the remaining seven members of Rinere’s department can be laid off.
While reducing staffing in the advising office, it would also be wise to cancel Rinere’s brainchild, the wasteful Peer Advising Fellows program. The PAF program enrolls about 190 upperclassmen and pays them $1,000 per year. By contrast, the old prefect program, which accomplished the same goals, cost the College virtually nothing. With Rinere leaving, there is no reason not to go back to the day when the only thing that upperclass mentors earned was the right to eat in Annenberg.
Similarly, there is a tremendous amount of room to cut within the larger FAS administration. The most obvious place to start cutting is the FAS Office of Communications, led by Director of Communications Robert P. Mitchell. This office could easily be merged with its university-wide counterpart. In fact, the university’s communications staff could likely absorb the responsibility of managing public relations for FAS with just one additional staff member, and the rest of the FAS communications staff can be let go.
Additionally, FAS has become overstuffed in recent years with a number of financial administrators, a hiring binge that took place out of a desire to get a better handle on the FAS endowment and gear up for a new capital campaign. With the downturn making these concerns largely irrelevant, the finance staff seems like a logical place to scale back. The newly hired deputies of administrators like Associate Dean for Finance Deena Giancotti and Senior Associate Dean and Director for Development Paul Keenan could likely go, given that FAS operated adequately without them just a few years ago.
Perhaps the most significant bloat in FAS has come from Smith’s decision to create a new layer of bureaucracy by hiring a significant amount of support staff for each of the three divisional deans. Even during flush times, many professors questioned this strategy, arguing that large divisional offices would be a waste of precious resources on non-academic staff.
Just a year or so after Smith “empowered” divisional deans, this criticism seems to be on the mark. The three senior staff members in each division—a total of nine—should probably be eliminated. At the very least, the positions of administrative deans Russ Porter (science), Beverly Beatty (social sciences), and Sara Oseasohn (humanities) ought to be cut, with the work taken up by the divisional deans themselves. And, if the divisional deans—all of whom are tenured professors—are receiving any significant remuneration from University Hall, they should consider returning these supplementary salaries for the duration of the fiscal crunch.
There is no doubt that there must be layoffs among the administrative staff who support students and faculty, and FAS leaders ought to be applauded for making real reductions. But not all cuts are equal, and FAS should focus on those that have the least impact on students and faculty. A logical way to go about making cuts is to scale back the most recent growth, a principle that would mean reductions in offices like advising, communications, finance, and the divisional deans. While these cuts might not be enough to stave off steps like reducing the shuttle schedule and laying off House-based staff, eliminating bureaucratic positions first would at least ensure that the FAS is putting its core missions above all else.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On May 11, 2009, an announcement from Dean of Faculty Michael D. Smith delivered a stark truth to students—budget cuts had been made to student life, and students had not been included in the process. Within hours, e-mail lists exploded with discussions about shuttles, hot breakfasts, dining-hall workers, House administrators, and the elimination of anonymous HIV testing at UHS. The administration responded to the announcement by holding a series of town -hall meetings across campus. College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds and members of the College administration took questions and tried to comfort students who were concerned about their safety, nutrition, education, and quality of life. However, the town halls came far too late, for the administration spent only four hours listening to student concerns when it should have been listening for the past four months. 
An economic crisis provides a unique opportunity for a college to restructure its priorities. In an Undergraduate Council meeting on May 3, Deans Smith and Hammonds reassured the UC that preserving the undergraduate experience was their goal and that, despite cutbacks, the heart of student life would remain intact. But, last Monday, it became clear that administrators and students had different interpretations of the undergraduate experience. 
Broad community input prior to the announcement of the first budget cuts would likely have resolved the serious issues that have since arisen. Consultation with House Committees and staff would have revealed the deep impact that cuts to House budgets will have on House life, consultation with Quad students would have revealed the importance of a late night shuttle, and consultation with all students may have provided more innovative solutions to saving money. 
While I commend Dean Hammonds for creating working groups with student representatives, I encourage the administration to think more broadly about student participation. Going forward, students are concerned that they will continue to be left out of the process as further cost-saving plans are announced, and the administration must publicly address the widespread belief that, over the summer, numerous additional cuts will be made to staff, faculty, and student life.
In the past week, students have created several websites, feedback forms, and petitions. Now, the administration must follow suit and create a website that makes the budget process transparent. Since all members of the Harvard community must make sacrifices, all members of the community should understand and be fully informed of our financial situation. Like MIT, Harvard should create a website that allows students to see how much we need to save, where the College is thinking of cutting back, and allow undergraduates to rank proposals and see the dollar value that is associated with each plan. In addition, students should be allowed to provide their own creative solutions to budget cuts, for we have the best perspective on where the College could save money while not hurting student life. Also, when plans are being established, few students understand who is responsible for making the decisions. Regular communication from Dean Hammonds could provide students with a greater understanding of when and how financial decisions that affect the college are being made. 
While these solutions to lack of open communication between administrators and students would provide short-term relief, the current budget-cut confusion is reflective of a larger and more permanent problem with College governance. For too long, decisions at Harvard have been made behind closed doors, and a lack of student input in major university policies continues to be a problem.
In February, the Dowling Committee made a series of recommendations to reorganize the structure of student-faculty committees by giving them real decision-making power. The reforms would allow the three main college committees to implement proposals that students, faculty, and staff have worked on together. While the school reorganizes its finances, it should also reorganize its bureaucracy. A more inclusive process of decision-making at the college would allow students to have a permanent role in college planning, and, in times of crisis, the administration would not have to completely reinvent a way to communicate with its own students.
If Harvard wants to continue to be a leader in higher education, it must see the financial reorganization as an opportunity to teach students to think critically about making collective sacrifices. We are the reason the College was created, and we deserve to both learn from and contribute to the problem-solving process. This financial crisis is one of the greatest in Harvard’s history, and all voices in the College community must be included in order to preserve Harvard as we know it today and to improve it for the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The administration’s adamant assertions that “there are advantages and disadvantages to every House” are beginning to wear thin. Despite the disputable pros and cons of each location, only the blindly obtuse could refute that residents of Harvard’s three “Quad houses”—Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer—will be disproportionately affected by the recent budget cuts. Although the university has only announced $77 million of the reported $220 million in cuts to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences budget, the most significant changes—closing the Quad’s Hilles library and drastically reconfiguring the shuttle schedule—directly concern only Quad students. With 25 percent of the Harvard undergraduate population bearing the brunt of the university’s cutbacks, it appears that George Orwell’s famous adage holds true: Some Harvard students are more equal than others.
Quad students are faced with diminished access to university facilities and legitimate disadvantages as a result of their location—a claim founded on more than a lazy reaction to a 15-minute walk. The recent budget cuts only heighten existing shortcomings, so that the number of holes in services available for Quad students has now approached the point of absurdity. Students may soon find themselves without cell-phone reception, unable to call the escort service that would have replaced the shuttle that isn’t there, to take them to a library that isn’t available nearby. 
In addition to obvious safety concerns that demand revocation of current cuts, the lack of late-night transportation limits Quad students’ ability to hold late -night jobs or participate in many extra-curricular activities. Religious students will now be offered no transport for the journey to services on weekend mornings, and no one would envy the fate of a Quadded athlete, forced to rise before the sun in order to travel to practice by foot on university holidays. 
This prohibitive lack of transport options presents the greatest inconvenience for Quad students with disabilities. Even prior to the cuts, the disability van became the night van after 7 p.m., meaning that students with disabilities were often forced to face a 45-minute wait each time they used the service. The situation is only likely to worsen as the number of shuttles falls and demand for the night bus increases. Furthermore, the decreased number of shuttles means that those remaining will be even more crowded, presenting significant accessibility concerns for students with wheelchairs. Given the lack of convenient travel options, Quad students with disabilities have considerably diminished access to River facilities, to the extent that the dearth of late-night transportation practically imposes a curfew on their leaving the Quad.
The inconvenient impact of recent cuts to Quad services is only compounded by a general shortage of concern for the needs of student residents. For years, students’ objections to the erratic shuttle schedule have been ignored, and the same dismissive attitude is awarded to Quad faculty. Upon release of the recent budget cuts, all Quad resident deans and House masters expressed extreme dissatisfaction at not having even been consulted. So great is the lack of consideration awarded Quad concerns that during town-hall meetings, administration officials professed unawareness of the ineffectuality of the escort and van service and even ignorance about transportation available for Quad students with disabilities. Quad students, constituting a full quarter of the undergraduate student body, do not deserve to suffer from such flippantly imposed cuts. 
The diminished services that result from the budget cuts greatly substantiate perceptions that Quad Houses are in some way “lesser” than River Houses. All are familiar with the embarrassing Housing Day spectacle of tear-stained cheeks on the devastated faces of those who didn’t gain coveted access to Adams or Eliot. While much of the strange stigma associated with Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer Houses is ill-founded, transportation difficulties may now begin to outweigh the beautiful rooms and tight-knit community. Implications of the Quad commute might now actually provide a credible excuse to cry on Housing Day. 
The Quad has no cause to be considered the unfortunate domain of reluctantly banished unfortunates. With its spacious quarters, strong sense of House pride, and short walk to many shops and restaurants, the Quad is a wonderful place to live. But students will only consider it as such when the administration seriously considers the needs of those living there. Quad students now have justifiable safety concerns about returning home late at night and considerably lesser access to the many late-night activities on campus.
Budget cuts are a reality, and we understand that the Quad must be affected; in an economic climate like this, we all must make sacrifices. As the university cuts back, however, it must ensure that options are in place to provide each undergraduate with a relatively equivalent experience. The budget cuts should impact the university as a whole, and, if aspects of Quad life—such as the shuttle—must be compromised, then adequate substitutes responsive to student need must be provided. If Quad students must be subjected to “separate but equal” rhetoric, then Harvard must at least give this principle the impression of sincerity.

The Unit Test Program of Social Analysis 10: “Principles of Economics” will cut the number of test graders next year in an effort to increase accountability and cost-effectiveness, according to Unit Test Coordinator Thomas E. Wei.In an e-mail sent Wednesday to test graders for the course (commonly referred to as “Ec 10”), Wei wrote that the Unit Test program “will undergo significant reforms” next semester, including reducing the number of graders, enhancing channels for feedback, and rewarding grading performance with monetary bonuses.Wei said that the reduction in the number of test graders was not financially motivated. Although there will be fewer graders, Wei said the move actually will be “cost-neutral” since each grader will be required to work more hours, leaving the total number of paid hours constant. He estimated that the program will hire about 50 students this upcoming fall, a drop from the 67 students hired at the beginning of last year.Each semester in the course, 10 unit tests are given, with each test cycle lasting eight days. Each test grader is required to work two nights of the test cycle, during which they discuss answers with students and give a pass or incomplete grade. Depending on the number of students taking the test that night, the grading process could vary from being a one-on-one conversation between a grader and a student to a group session involving multiple students. The reduction seeks to increase accountability and alleviate “enormous” variability among graders, said Wei, who explained that because the tests’ format is free response, the grade and quality of feedback largely depends on the individual grader. While some graders are very comprehensive and spend a long time with students, others are less committed, said Wei. Wei said he also hoped the reduction in test graders would lead to greater selectivity in the program, since only the graders who are devoted will decide to commit to the longer hours. Wei said that the reforms came about as a result of ongoing scrutiny, as well as feedback from students, test graders, and course staff.Linda Ge ’11, who was a unit test grader this year and will be a supervisor in the program next year, said she supported the changes being implemented, since grader variability has been an issue in the past. “Some graders are willing to put in more effort, but others will just rush through,” Ge said. “Hopefully, hiring fewer workers will make sure that the graders are more willing to work hard.”Because each grader will be expected to work more nights, the number of students per grader will remain the same, said Ge.Though graders said they thought the reforms were well-intentioned, some expressed concern over the staff reduction.“I just hope I’m hired next year,” said current test grader Eliza A. Lehner ’11.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

After slashing two-thirds of its publicly traded stock holdings in the fourth quarter of last year, Harvard has substantially reshuffled its equity investments and expanded its emerging and foreign markets portfolio, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure report released last week.Though the disclosed assets represent only a small fraction of the University’s total holdings, the report provides a glimpse of how Harvard Management Company—the group that oversees the University’s multi-billion dollar endowment—is navigating this year’s tumultuous and markedly changed financial landscape. University officials say they have been planning for a total 30 percent drop in the endowment by the end of the current fiscal year.Despite an increase in public equity holdings to almost $772 million by March 31, up from $571 million in the previous quarter, the University has still dramatically reduced its publicly traded equities portfolio, which was valued at almost $2.9 billion as late as last September. Harvard appears to have redirected many of its investments after those sales, with the number of reported holding entries increasing from 71 to 99, two-thirds of which are new investments.In the latest quarter ending March 31, Harvard boosted its investments in foreign markets by purchasing almost $50 million worth of shares in an exchange-traded fund tracking South Korean indices, while also deepening investments in China, Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa that now amount to nearly $300 million—close to double the figure in those areas as of Dec. 31.Harvard also purchased over 2 million shares of Vanguard Emerging Markets, bringing the value of that investment to over $54 million, up from the less than $1 million invested there in the previous quarter. The largest holding listed in the latest 13F filings continued to be the $205 million invested in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund. But both the value of that investment and the number of shares owned have declined since the last filing, which showed University holdings as of Dec. 31. Harvard then had $224 million invested in the fund—a substantial dollar value reduction from the $463 million it had invested in the fund as of Sept. 30 but still nearly 40 percent of the University’s total reported holdings.The report also suggests that Harvard is shuffling its other equity holdings, with over half of the investments listed on the previous quarter’s filing sold off. Notable new equity investments include $9.7 million worth of shares in Rupert Murdoch’s media giant News Corp.; $16 million in China Mobile, the world’s biggest wireless-phone carrier; $13 million in Teva Pharmaceutical, the world’s largest generic drug maker; and $3.5 million in Sprint Nextel Corp.The increasing emphasis on emerging market equity has likely helped hedge against dramatic declines in the domestic stock market. While the S&P 500 fell 12 percent from Dec. 31 to March 31, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has remained essentially flat over that period.The SEC’s Form 13F requires institutional investment managers that oversee more than $100 million in exchange-traded stocks and closed-end companies to report those holdings. Companies are “closed-end” if they sell a fixed number of shares that are traded on exchanges, whereas open-end companies, such as mutual funds, collect public money and invest the funds in stocks, bonds, and other securities.Harvard also invests extensively in foreign stocks, private equity, fixed-income bonds, and real assets not listed on the filings. External investment firms currently manage 70 percent of the endowment. According to its 2008 year-end financial report, emerging market equity made up 10 percent of the University’s portfolio and returned 7.6 percent as of June 30, beating the HMC board-approved benchmark of 4.8 percent for the asset class.The year-end report noted that Harvard uses both internal and external managers, as well as international private equity funds, to oversee its emerging market equity, and listed as one policy change for the coming fiscal year “a need to think globally about asset allocation and investment alternatives.” University spokesman John D. Longbrake declined to comment on whether the increasing emphasis on emerging and foreign equity in the most recent SEC filings is indicative of a broader portfolio reallocation.—Staff writer Peter F. Zhu can be reached at pzhu@fas.harvard.edu.

If there was ever a make-or-break situation, yesterday was it. Tied at No. 15 going into yesterday’s EAWRC regatta in Camden, New Jersey, the Radcliffe heavyweight women’s crew team knew that it needed solid races in order to qualify for this year’s NCAA Championships. Rising to the occasion, every boat placed better than its seeding. With two second-place finishes and three third-place finishes, the Black and White now knows that on Tuesday, when the entries for NCAAs are released, it will be that much closer to extending its season. The day was filled with windy conditions as the first crews took to the water, but for the Radcliffe heavyweights, that was the last thing on their minds. Ranked just out of medaling contention in every race except the third varsity B four, the Black and White was ready to assert itself as a team to beat. “We wanted to go out there and come in above our seeding,” varsity coxswain Jill Carlson said.  “We wanted to medal. We wanted to be better than fourth place.”The varsity eight event started with Dartmouth, Princeton and Radcliffe neck and neck as Yale took an early lead off of the start. While the Bulldogs continued to gain an edge on the field, Radcliffe took a move at the 750-meter mark, surprising a Big Green crew that began to fall back. The rest of the race was a battle for second place, as both the Tigers and the Black and White tried to get their bows in front. “There was definitely that sense of urgency, of ‘we need to perform today,’ to really assert ourselves today,” Carlson said. In the last 25 strokes, Radcliffe kicked it into another gear, mustering enough strength to push into Yale and beat Princeton by 0.7 seconds.“We knew that it was everyone’s race from the starting line and that we were going up against five extremely fast crews and that it was going to take an extraordinary race even to medal,” senior co-captain Anna Kendrick said. “To be less than a second behind a national champion crew was really exciting for us.”Brown, Dartmouth and Northeastern rounded out the finishers in the Grand Final. By beating Brown, the No. 4-ranked school in the nation and the No. 1-seeded school going into this event, the Black and White has a strong chance of being in the top 16 to qualify for the NCAA championships taking place later this month. The rest of the heavyweight team had similar success, as the second varsity eight managed to pull away with a bronze medal despite being seeded fourth. Following Brown and Yale, which pulled 6:34.2 and 6:39.7 respectively, Radcliffe bested the No. 3 seeded Princeton with a time of 6:42.45.   The remaining heavyweight races included a tight third place finish in the varsity A four, with Radcliffe falling to Brown by only 0.3 seconds. The varsity C four also placed third, while in the varsity B four, the crew managed to pull out a second place finish, falling to Yale but beating Brown with a time of 7:35.2. “All of the boats across the board performed above and beyond,” Kendrick said. “Everyone was at the top of their game today.”For the lightweight squad, the weekend was more bittersweet. Ranked No. 2 nationally going into the race, the varsity eight could not stop Wisconsin, Princeton and Georgetown from taking control. “The first varsity race had a pretty disappointing race,” senior captain Rebekkah Kharrazi said. “We came in fourth, which is how we did last year, and it’s always nice to get a medal and come up with hardware, but we were unable to manage it.”The Black and White knew the competition would be tough, but after beating Georgetown and Princeton earlier in the season, the team hoped to place according to rankings.“We hadn’t seen Georgetown since the beginning of the season,” Kharrazi said. “They were a big unknown. We’ve been training, they’ve been training, so we really weren’t sure how everything was going to go down. We knew it’d be competitive, but again we hoped to do better than fourth.”The second varsity eight made the day a little sweeter with a second place finish in its event. Although it trailed Wisconsin from the beginning, Radcliffe pulled out a seven-seat lead coming into the half-way mark. Never looking back, the rowers crossed the line in 7:19, ending the season with silver medals around their necks. As the rest of the team focuses on exams and the beginning of summer, the varsity lightweight eight will have an opportunity for revenge as they travel with the Harvard men’s heavyweight and lightweight team to IRA National Regatta in Sacremento June 6.  —Staff writer Alex Sopko can be reached at sopko@fas.harvard.edu.

While the rest of us may be swamped with finals and papers, the Harvard track and field team found itself one in a deep pool of teams at the three-day 2009 ECAC/IC4A Championships in Princeton, N.J. When the dust settled yesterday, the women’s side held on to 20th—out of 57—while the men settled for 22nd—out of 52.“It was a good weekend for us,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It’s always good to get back after the emotional and competitive Ivy League Championships.”And though the middle-of-the-pack team results left a lot to be desired, several individuals took away impressive results leading to NCAA qualifications. And it was a particularly poignant weekend for the seniors competing this weekend.Senior Becky Christensen stayed true to form, clearing a second-place 1.81-meter bar in the high jump. The clearance topped the NCAA-qualifying mark, though Christensen already claimed her NCAA bid earlier in the season. “The competition was good. My timing was off,” Christensen said. “It was good preparation for Regionals cause a lot of the girls I competed with are the ones I’ll see in North Carolina.”Classmate Brittan Smith also surpassed the NCAA qualifier for the second time this season. Her 6.02-meter leap in the long jump event earned her a share of second place, though a tie-breaker jump relegated her to third.“For [Brittan] to do that at the ECAC Championships going into NCAAs is a big confidence booster for her,” Saretsky said.And though the women’s 4x800-meter relay team finished eighth in the final yesterday, running the event in 9:11.98, the quad group of seniors Jan Ng and Aishlinn O’Callaghan, sophomore Thea Lee, and freshman Meghan Looney set a new school record in its preliminary heat. Its time of 8:51.13 on Saturday bested the previous school record of 8:52.52, set in 2006 by a group that included Ng and O’Callaghan as freshman.Also highlighting the weekend, sophomore Eric Clayman notched a seventh-place hammer toss of 59.27 meters, earning him a bid to the NCAA Regionals taking place in two weeks. “He had a big big breakthrough performance,” Saretsky said. “He really nailed his technique down when it mattered, and it’s great to see him move to the next level.”Junior and next year’s co-captain Jack Brady also competed in the event, tossing the hammer 50.05 meters—good for 37th. Brady also competed in the discus and shot put, where he threw a 10th-place 48.49 meters and 24th-place 14.95 meters respectively.Sophomore Claire Richardson, whose focus this season has primarily been on the 5K, competed in the 1500-meter run. Her time of 4:28.35 was just shy of qualifying her for her second event at NCAAs, but it did give her a new personal record in the event.“That just shows how versatile Claire is,” Christensen said. “Claire can run anything.”Freshman Nico Weiler continued his dominance in the pole vault, running away with the win by a tenth of a meter by clearing the 5.15-meter bar.“Nico’s really a competitor,” Saretsky said. “He’s got a great perspective of what this meet means. The conditions weren’t ideal, but he got after it and competed hard.”Sophomore Jessica Fronk also surpassed the NCAA-qualifying mark in the javelin—though she was already qualified from an earlier meet—with a throw of 44.32. Senior Evan Favermann followed with a 21st-place toss of 37.27 meters. —Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

Freshman Rachel Brown of the Harvard softball team was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year in a league announcement last Thursday. Brown, a pitcher, made the All-Ivy First Team, one of the Crimson’s six all-league selections.In her rookie season, Brown shattered the Harvard single-season strikeout record, recording 211 on the season. Her total was tops in the league, and she ranks ninth nationally with 9.8 strikeouts per game, another Crimson single-season record.Brown finished the season with a 16-7 record and a 1.49 ERA in 28 appearances. Her four saves were good for 10th-best in the nation. She pitched 15 complete games on the season, including two shutouts, three two-hitters and a pair of one-hitters.Brown was especially dominant in preseason action, earning MVP honors at both the Highlander Classic and Miken Classic. Among Ivy pitchers, she ranked in the top three in all major pitching categories. The freshman led the league in strikeouts, saves, innings pitched (150.1), and opponent batting average (.183). She is seventh on the Harvard career strikeout list, and 12th in all-time wins.Brown was joined on the first team by junior outfielder Jennifer Francis, who led the Crimson with a .311 batting average, hitting .368 against Ancient Eight competition.Sophomore outfielder Emily Henderson, who led the Ivies in stolen bases with 15, was named to the second team.Co-captain and catcher Hayley Bock, sophomore second baseman Ellen Macadam, and junior third baseman Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, all received honorable mention.—KATE LEIST

We know the school year isn't over quite yet, but hey, who are we kidding. You have no desire to actually study for those last couple exams. Nah. You'd rather dream of the semester to come. FlyBy is here to help.
We got our grubby hands on the preliminary list of courses that will be available to students in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences for the 2009-2010 school year. And some of these new classes look, to say the least, stimulating.
Check out FlyBy's shopping list, after the jump.

We at FlyBy have a slight obsession with watching episodes of Ivory Tower, Harvard's premiere soap opera. It's quite startling, really, how the show manages to transform such familiar venues like the Winthrop dining hall into foreign places that set the stage for conversations and interactions that don't actually happen in real Harvard  life.
In the most recent episode, "Closets and Crushes," the basement hallway of the Science Center becomes the place for awkward pasty boys to ask girls who just want to "rage" out on a "date" to a "rad pre-med thing...party, party!" All we know is that, in our years at Harvard, literally nothing worth recollecting has happened in that hallway with the two vending machines and the IT equipment.
Video and more post-jump.

Admittedly, the acting was pretty good. FlyBy didn't find itself squirming with every line, and that one tall dude was even kinda cute. But the writers of Ivory Tower might need to rethink their plays on verbal titillation: the shoddy attempts at double-entendre ranged from "You only play with your balls when you're worked up" to "Is that a banana in your pants? Because I will peel it for you" to "C'mon girl, give me your biochemical desires." Now we just want to hurl and cry.
And we end with a pearl of wisdom from one of the male characters: "That's your problem. Your idea of romance is grinding a girl on the dance floor when what girls want is to waltz." But the episode revolves around romance induced by Petros' "Body Glow."  Mixed messages?
