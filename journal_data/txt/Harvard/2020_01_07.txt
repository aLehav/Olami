After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council elected Councilor Sumbul Siddiqui the new mayor of Cambridge for the 2020-2021 term by a unanimous vote at the council’s inaugural meeting Monday.
Siddiqui, a long-time Cambridge resident, is in her second term on the Cambridge City Council and will serve as Massachusetts’s first Muslim mayor.
Her election marks the end of Marc C. McGovern’s tenure as mayor of Cambridge for the 2018-2019 term. McGovern announced last week that he would not be seeking reelection, throwing his support to Siddiqui.
Prior to serving on the council, Siddiqui earned a bachelor's degree in public policy from Brown University and a law degree from Northwestern's Pritzker School of Law. She has also served as an AmeriCorps fellow at New Profit, a Boston nonprofit organization that works to improve social mobility for children.
In her address to the council at Monday’s meeting, Siddiqui discussed the role service has played in her life.
“When people ask me what I do, I tell them I’m a public servant,” Siddiqui said. “And I’m very proud of that answer, because service has defined my life.”
“Service is second nature in Cambridge,” she added. “It is one of our greatest strengths.”
Siddiqui also spoke about her family’s immigration to America from Pakistan and the impact Cambridge has had on their lives.
“I can only imagine how my parents must have felt, in a completely new place, rebuilding their lives with very little money, but a great deal of determination,” she said. “Thank goodness that place was Cambridge, a city that continues to welcome immigrants from around the world.”
Siddiqui also outlined her aims for her mayoral term, highlighting goals to create “more affordable housing and economic opportunity,” close “the achievement gap,” and improve the “response to instances of racism.” She concluded her speech with a call to “get to work.”
In the same meeting, Councillor Alanna M. Mallon was elected vice mayor in a unanimous vote in the first ballot. She succeeds Jan Devereux, who served as vice mayor for the 2018-2019 term but did not seek reelection.
Like Siddiqui, Mallon is beginning her second term on the City Council. Prior to serving on the council, Mallon worked as Educational Liaison to Mayor David Maher in 2015-2016 and has been working at Food for Free, a program dedicated to improving communities' access to healthy food, since January of 2016.
In her address to the council at Monday’s meeting, Mallon also discussed the importance of service in improving the lives of individuals.
“Big picture politics and ambitious policies sometimes overshadow the most important work and impactful work of the council: the power that we have to improve people’s lives through one-on-one constituent services,” she said.
Mallon added that service can unite the council behind a common goal.
“It’s when passions run high that it will be the most important to remember that this job is truly about service,” she said.
“We all serve with the end goal of making Cambridge a better, safer, and more livable place,” she added.
The Jan. 6 meeting of the council commences the body’s two-year legislative term. An oath of office was administered to the council’s nine members, comprised of seven incumbents as well as two newcomers who were elected in November.
The next City Council meeting will take place Monday, Jan. 13, with Siddiqui presiding.
In Siddiqui’s address, she spoke about her hope for a positive future for Cambridge.
“As mayor, I am committed to leading this council as we look ahead to a new decade,” she said. “We will rise to meet the challenges facing our community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Hillel and Harvard Chabad will implement increased safety measures following a spate of anti-Semitic incidents across the nation, according to the group’s leaders.
Rabbi Hirschy Zarchi, Jewish chaplain and director at Harvard Chabad, wrote in an email to The Crimson that Harvard Chabad has been working with police and private experts to ensure students’ safety in Chabad House and take the recent incidents “very seriously.”
“Harvard Chabad is a home away from home and a center for Jewish Life and Learning for thousands of students at Harvard,” Zarchi wrote. “The safety and well-being of our students, wherever they may be, is of paramount importance to us.”
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, Harvard Hillel’s executive director, wrote in an email to Hillel affiliates last Tuesday that Hillel is also working “closely” and “actively” with Harvard University Police Department on increased safety measures for its building.
“I can say that we have taken a number of concrete steps, some quite visible, some less conspicuous, in addition to improvements already made over the past several years, to make sure that our Jewish center in the heart of this land’s most famous university is as safe and secure as it is welcoming,” he wrote.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on whether his department has been working on increasing security at Hillel and Chabad, citing the department’s policy “not to comment on staffing, equipment, operations, and security measures” in an email.
The measures come amid a resurgence of anti-Semitic violence in the U.S. In October 2018, an assailant opened fire inside a Pittsburgh synagogue killing at least 11 congregants and wounding six, marking the deadliest-ever attack on American Jews.
More recently, a man stabbed and wounded five people during Hanukkah festivities at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, N.Y. on Dec. 28. On Sunday, thousands of people marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in a show of solidarity with the Jewish community after the Monsey stabbing.
Cambridge has also seen at least one instance of potentially anti-Jewish activity in recent years. In December 2018, police conducted an investigation of a “possible hate crime” after witnesses said a man intentionally toppled over a large menorah placed on Cambridge Common by student group Harvard Chabad.
Hillel President Rebecca S. Araten ’22, an inactive Crimson staff writer, said the security measures are meant to protect Jewish students’ ability to practice their Judaism “openly” and “confidently” at Harvard in light of the recent attacks.
"We hope that our new security measures will in no way make Hillel feel intimidating or scary, because Hillel is really just a place that makes it easier for students to become Jewish leaders and live according to their values,” she said.
Asked about both the attacks and the new security measures, several Jewish students said they believe religious spaces like Chabad and Hillel are increasingly vital.
Caroline A. Silver ’21, who volunteers with Chabad, said she thinks of Chabad as an “extension” of campus.
“Volunteering with Chabad is my favorite part of Jewish life at Harvard,” Silver said. “Chabad really is a wonderful space.”
Eleanor Y. Grueskin ’21 said she has appreciated how “excited” Hillel is to welcome different students from different backgrounds.
“It's been a really inclusive space both for myself as a Reform Jew and for a lot of my friends that come from different denominations and also just different religions generally,” she said.
Ariel G. Silverman ’22 said she believes the rise in acts of anti-Semitism with attacks is symptomatic of growing animosity toward many religious groups. A day after the stabbing in Monsey, a gunman fatally shot two people at a church in Texas.
“I think expressing solidarity and working together with other groups to end that violence is the best way, rather than cornering ourselves off and thinking of ourselves as a unique group with a unique experience,” Silverman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chris Lewis is a guy who likes to do his talking on the court.
While it might seem somewhat contradictory for a 6 feet 9 inch senior forward whose favorite method of scoring is a thunderous slam dunk, Lewis is a soft-spoken player away from the hardwood.
Whether it be in a postgame interview or with his teammates, the veteran has earned a reputation for leading by example. And while other players may command respect more demonstrably or vocally, Lewis’ leadership and performance in the past month are becoming harder and harder to ignore.
Since the beginning of Harvard men’s basketball’s December road trip to Washington, D.C. and the Bay Area, Lewis has scored in double figures in five straight games, matching a career high. The Alpharetta, Ga., native led the team in scoring in its first three games of the trip, highlighted by 22 points against George Washington, second to only the 29 points he scored against Cornell in double overtime his sophomore season.
“I think it was the ball movement,” said Lewis, quick to attribute his succesful performance against George Washington to his teammates. “My guards were feeding me, giving me good passes so I could get good finishes, I just give credit to them.”
Over the past month the Crimson has focused on getting its star big man looks closer to the basket, also using him as a press-breaking tool as seen against the University of San Francisco. This strategy of targeting Lewis on the inside has helped boost the senior into the top 30 players in the country in field goal percentage, amongst approximately 4,500 Division I players.
With fellow senior Bryce Aiken exiting the first game of the trip with a sprained foot, Lewis calmly stepped into the spotlight, leading Harvard to a flawless 4-0 road trip before returning home to beat UC Irvine. Alongside fellow senior, guard Christian Juzang, the forward has been a key cog in a stretch that has propelled the Crimson to a six game winning streak entering Ivy League play.
As much as any on-court contributions, however, teammates point to the guidance and example that seniors like Lewis and Juzang have provided throughout the recent run of success.
“This last four game stretch they’ve been playing really well,” junior guard Rio Haskett said of Lewis, Juzang, and the rest of the seniors. “They’ve honestly just been leading us, all the seniors have been leading us like crazy.”
As a crucial member of Harvard’s highly touted 2020 recruiting class, Lewis is often highlighted on television broadcasts and the media more generally, who frequently focus on the senior’s Computer Science concentration, and his internship at Facebook.
Others choose to underscore his several Power Five offers from schools like Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, and the University of Miami, or the fact that he seriously considered attending MIT in lieu of playing Division I basketball. And of course, the all-too frequently told tale of his father, former NFLer Mo Lewis, whose crushing hit on New England Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe gave Tom Brady the first opportunity in his storybook career.
But beyond his academic interests, career aspirations, and familial anecdotes, lies a player who is content to let his basketball speak for itself. The renewed vigor and confidence that Lewis has played with over the past month hasn’t been lost on his fellow players, who point to the effort and dedication often unseen by the media as the catalyst for his brilliant stretch of play.
“This man has really been taking it to the next level, offensively and defensively,” said Juzang, Lewis’ teammate of four years. “He’s been really doing it. Whether it’s coming to practice early, the little things that people don’t really take notice of. He’s been really dialed in and I’m proud of him.”
As Juzang pointed out, Lewis’ impressive performance over the past five games haven’t just been restricted to the offensive side of the floor. Not only did Lewis tie a career high with four blocks when matched up against Cal’s 6’8 255 pound big man Andre Kelly, but the senior was able to set a new program record for blocks. Lewis surpassed Keith Wright ‘12 and his 150 blocks, with a total currently standing at 156, and the entirety of the conference schedule still remaining.
Although the past month has been a flourishing spell of play for the Alpharetta Ga., native, his career at Harvard hasn’t always been smooth sailing. After a promising sophomore season that saw him garner first-team All-Ivy honors, as well as NABC All-District second team and Ivy League All-Tournament Team recognition, the 2018-2019 campaign wasn’t as successful for Lewis.
After averaging nearly 13 points per game the prior season, Lewis registered just over 10 per contest in his junior season, with slightly fewer rebounds and more turnovers per game. And although his numbers were by no means shoddy, in a conference featuring talented forwards AJ Brodeur, Richmond Aririguzoh, Chris Knight, and Tamenang Choh, the Milton High School product was omitted from First and Second Team All-Ivy Teams. The lone Honorable Mention for the 2018-2019 season was given to another forward, Columbia’s Patrick Tape, implying that Lewis had performed in the bottom half amongst Ancient Eight big men.
A year later, Lewis appears poised to return to the ranks of the conference’s best, with a 64 percent field goal percentage that currently places him second in the Ivy League. This level of efficiency has been perhaps the most impressive part of Lewis’ recent play. Since a 3-of-3 performance against UMass on December 7th, Lewis has converted on an impressive 39-of-52 field goals, scoring at a remarkable 75 percent clip.
“A point of emphasis for us was to utilize Lewis on the inside,” Coach Tommy Amaker explained during the road trip. “He came through for us.”
The senior garnered Ivy League player of the week honors for his stretch of solid performances, including a perfect game at California during which Lewis scored or punctuated all seven of his field goal attempts with slam dunks, also draining all five of his free-throw opportunities. 24 hours later, the senior put together an impressive 14 point, 9 rebound night that was highlighted by a crucial 36 minutes of action, the second longest outing of his career.
In addition to setting the all-time Harvard record for blocks, Lewis has recorded at least one block or steal in all but one game this year, a crucial stat for a Crimson program that hangs its hat on limiting opponents’ scoring.
“It’s critical, there’s no other way of saying it,” said Coach Amaker of Lewis and the rest of the team’s defensive focus. “Our defense is our calling card for our program, we’ve built our program around defense, and our guys have had great effort.”
As the senior enters the twilight of his career at Harvard, the unspoken elephant in the room still remains for Lewis and the rest of the Class of 2020. This vaunted recruiting quartet of Lewis, Aiken, former conference player of the year Seth Towns, Robert Baker, and key role players Juzang, Justin Bassey, and captain Henry Welsh, have still yet to reach the NCAA Tournament.
Two straight conference championship appearances have brought consecutive losses against the hosts of the Ivy Madness tournaments, despite Harvard holding the No. 1 seed both seasons. With Towns undergoing season-ending surgery and entering the transfer portal, and yet another Aiken injury on the precipice of the Ivy League season, there are plenty of reasons to be distracted from the players currently in Coach Amaker’s rotation.
But don’t be.
This Crimson team is entering its best run of form, with Lewis leading the way in the middle alongside sophomore Noah Kirkwood, freshman phenom Chris Ledlum, the rest of the senior class, and a cadre of junior and sophomore role players. And no player has been bigger than Lewis in helping the Crimson find consistency in the wake of injuries, turnovers, and the myriad other issues that arise over the course of a college basketball season.
Perhaps Coach Amaker put it best, humorously noting the stress relief that can accompany the end of finals, by saying, “I just think that he’s in a good place right now.”
With six victories in a row and a two week layoff in which Aiken may be able to return to full strength, before back-to-back Saturday contests against Dartmouth, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about Harvard men’s basketball.
Just don’t expect any of them to affect Chris Lewis’ poise or play, or to see a smile or a smirk out of the 6’9 senior.
He’ll let his play speak for itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Union Dutchwomen and Rensselaer (RPI) Engineers have struggled in league play, yet both teams managed to start strong against Harvard in last weekend’s ECAC matchups. Nonetheless, the Crimson eventually cruised to a 7-2 victory over the Dutchwomen, thanks to a five-goal second-period explosion, and outlasted the Engineers 3-0, methodically putting up one goal in each frame. With the performance, the Harvard undefeated season in league play remains intact as the Crimson pushed its record to 9-0-0 in the ECAC and 10-4-0 overall.
HARVARD 3, RPI 0
The Engineers are still seeking their first win of the season, but for much of the game on Saturday, they did not look like a winless team. While they never led, the game remained within two scores until the third period. In the last stanza, however, with Crimson attackers circulating the goalmouth and hindering the vision of first-year RPI goaltender Ena Nystrøm, sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald blasted a point shot through the maze of players. With the third and crucial tally, Harvard managed to build its lead to a comfortable 3-0 margin—ultimately the final score.
“Goalies these days—everyone is stopping the first shot,” junior goaltender Becky Dutton said. “The most important thing is taking away their eyes. That way we can get tips [and] rebounds...Maryna had a great goal from the point there, [and] I think the goalie was screened. Having that net-front presence is key to the whole team’s success.”
The goal was actually part of a larger theme for the Crimson: generating traffic in front of the net. Because goals did not come easily, battling in front of the net was critical to the offense. In addition to the third goal, which weaved through multiple players before passing Nystrøm, Harvard’s first and second goals depended on getting pressure on the goalie. In fact, both plays came off of rebounds.
“Being able to crash the net hard and get rebounds was a lot of how our goals went in,” sophomore forward Dominique Petrie said. “They [RPI] did a good job defensively—I will give them that—but I think we just persisted through and came out on top.”
On the first strike of the game, junior defender Emma Buckles fired a point shot hard along the ice, which Nystrøm did deflect with her stick, but the Engineer keeper did not manage to angle the puck into the corner or cover the rebound. With the puck in a dangerous position next to the crease, sophomore forward Kristin Della Rovere poked it free until it eventually trickled into the slot, where sophomore forward Anne Bloomer collected the loose change and backhanded it into the net.
Harvard’s second goal came off of a similar play, except this time, Della Rovere ripped the initial shot from the top of the circle. The puck again slid along the ice before caroming into a rebound, which Petrie hammered away at twice. Following her first attempt, she managed to power the puck into the net for another gritty goal. Jockeying for position in front, Petrie was actually knocked to the ice and finished the play on her knees; notwithstanding, she muscled the puck through the netminder anyways.
Initiating the rebounds that led to both goals, Della Rovere ended up with two assists for the game, leading the team in points for the day along with Petrie, who added a goal and an assist for her multi-point effort. Ultimately, although capitalizing on opportunities was a challenge, simplicity, execution, and determination proved to be the offensive keys that opened up the scoring for the Crimson.
“It’s doing the little things that add up over time that ultimately wins you games,” remarked Petrie as she summarized the efforts to fight in front of the net.
On the defensive end, Harvard showcased its depth and proved its strength at the goaltending position. Becky Dutton, in her first appearance of the season, put on a shutout performance, stifling all 21 RPI shots-on-goal. Dutton’s performance—her first shutout in a Crimson uniform—would earn her ECAC Goalie of the Week honors.
But, since the Crimson controlled many offensive stats (i.e. shots-on-goal, 40-21, and faceoffs, 27-14) and the ice tilted towards the Engineer cage, establishing a rhythm in goal was a challenge. Nonetheless, Dutton remained sharp, standing up to both flurries of shots and sporadic opportunities alike, and she credited her success to her mentality of not trying to do too much on any given play.
“The biggest thing for me in net was focusing on one puck at a time,” Dutton said. “You can’t worry about the next play, the next period, or anything like that.”
With the defensive end shored up, three goals would prove to be plenty for Harvard. RPI scrapped until the end, but the Crimson eventually became too much to handle, outlasting the Engineers.
“RPI really battled hard throughout the whole game,” Dutton said. “It definitely wasn’t a given that we were going to win. That’s any league play right now—anyone can win any game. For us, we had to keep the pressure on them.”
HARVARD 7, UNION 2
Despite coming into the game with six more wins—and ten fewer losses—than the Dutchwomen, and mustering an 11-8 shots-on-goal advantage in the opening stanza, the Crimson entered the first intermission deadlocked at zero. Nonetheless, the team sought to keep to its offensive game plan and tried not to overthink adjustments.
“We were playing really well in the first,” Petrie said. “We had a lot of scoring chances—we just didn’t capitalize. We came out in the second knowing that they [Union] were still going to give us their all, but we needed to step up and give them a little more. I think we did just that, and we got some puck luck and put them in the back of the net.”
Indeed, patience and persistence seemed to pay off in the second. Just 3:34 into the middle period, Harvard eventually broke the tie and gained a 1-0 lead as Petrie sprinted towards the cage before shifting laterally and shelving the finish.
“It was truly all due to my linemates,” Petrie said. “It started with a great breakout in the [defensive] zone, and then [junior forward] Keely [Moy] kicked it up to [junior forward] Brooke [Jovanovich], and I was cutting to the middle with speed calling for the pass. She [Jovanovich] gave me a great pass, and I just made a move, shot, and, luckily, it went in the back of the net.”
The line mentioned above impacted the game throughout the day. While Petrie put up five points (three goals and two assists), the combination of Petrie, Jovanovich, and Moy totaled 12 points on the day, with four points from Jovanovich (two goals and two assists) and three points from Moy (one goal and two assists).
“We were just playing off of each other and working with each other,” Jovanovich said. “We have a group of girls on our line who are very powerful forwards. It was just about trying to establish lanes, get shots, and then follow through. It was our second time playing together, so we just wanted to keep things simple.”
With momentum in hand after the first goal, the Crimson would look to extend its lead. That momentum, however, was stifled by a Macdonald interference penalty—but only for 51 seconds. Despite being one-skater down, Harvard continued its scoring rush, on a breakaway, but this time short-handed, with Jovanovich finishing the play. With a Union defender trailing, Jovanovich pulled the puck across the crease and tucked it past the outstretched toe of first-year Dutchwomen goalie Bella McKee.
“They [Union] broke down the ice, and our forwards [came] off with a late change,” Jovanovich said. “As I came on, I saw the puck get broken up in the play down in the far right corner. I thought maybe that they [Union] might try to send it down and that I could potentially try to grab it. That ended up happening—great play by [sophomore defender] Kyra [Willoughby] to get the puck down the ice and [by] Dom [Petrie] to make a tough play. I just tried to get the goalie moving. She was doing a really good job stopping first shots.”
Momentum now decidedly tipped in Harvard’s favor, but the squad took another penalty, this time tripping from first-year forward Courtney Hyland. Nonetheless, the Crimson again played the counter-attack, converting the one-skater disadvantage into yet another rush, with Petrie leading the charge for a second short-handed goal. Two Dutchwomen defenders closed in on Petrie and did dislodge the puck as she crossed the faceoff dot. Petrie, however, tracked the puck as it was knocked off her stick and regained possession before the defense could clear; all of a sudden, Petrie was one-on-one with the goalie McKee. With the goaltender opting not to poke-check, Petrie managed to outlast the butterfly slide and sneak a backhand inside the post to push the lead to 3-0.
For the rest of the period, Harvard stayed out of the penalty box, helping the Crimson to two more strikes in the second, including Petrie’s hat-trick-clinching third goal. That said, Union did have the last laugh of the middle frame, getting on the scoreboard in the final two minutes of the period. First-year forward Leah Herrfort notched the Dutchwomen’s first tally by ripping the puck into the top-right corner of the net off of a lateral drive in a play similar to Petrie’s first goal of the game. Eventually, after the 0-0 first and 5-1 second, Harvard would win the last period 2-1 to cap a 7-2 final.
Including the Petrie-Jovanovich-Moy trio, the Crimson saw 10 different players register a point, picking up from the game against Boston College on Dec. 31 which saw 11 different Harvard skaters earn points.
“No one person can win a game,” Jovanovich said. “If we are going to do it, we’re going to do it together… We talk about each person doing their job, and that’s what’s going to make it work. That’s what worked this weekend and last Tuesday.”
Notably, outside of Dutton’s first career shutout on Saturday, Friday saw several Crimson players achieve career firsts as well. Among them was sophomore goaltender Lindsay Reed, who not only made 21 saves on the day but also recorded her first assist at Harvard. First-year forward Shannon Hollands scored her first career goal in the third period, and first-year defender Nicki Lutschaunig added her first career point with an assist in the same stanza. Even Petrie’s hat trick was her first in a Harvard uniform, helping her get to a team-leading 24 points by the end of the weekend.
~
Overall, the weekend continues a five-game win streak for the Crimson. After winning its first five games of the season, Harvard hit a four-game skid but now has again rattled off five (and counting) consecutive wins. The last two games of that four-game losing stretch came against the top two teams in the country—Wisconsin and Minnesota—in the Country Classic, a late November showcase event held outside of Nashville, Tenn. Despite the two losses though, Harvard did take lessons away from Tennessee which have helped reignite the winning ways.
“We had a really good experience in Nashville,” Dutton said. “We didn’t get the result that we wanted, but we competed really hard, and we saw that we could keep up with those teams. Seeing that we were able to do that gave our team a little bit of confidence. We’re really sticking together right now, and working together with that confidence has brought really good results so far.”
