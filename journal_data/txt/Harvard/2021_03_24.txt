After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I heard about the shootings when they happened. I got the news notification on my phone. My Instagram stories feed was quickly populated with snapshots of news articles and beautiful, snappy graphics. “6 Asian women were killed in a mass shooting. The Asian hate must end.” “Stop Asian hate.” “Yesterday, 8 people were murdered as a result of a hate crime against Asian Americans. Call it a hate crime.”
I heard about the shootings when they happened, but that does not mean I knew anything about them. I swiped past article headlines and Instagram stories as fast as I could so they would not register. I filed them into the folder in my brain labeled “tragedies” and shoved it to the back of the drawer. I did not want to think about them, because that would make their reality undeniable, and I could not stand that.
The concept of the dead viscerally disturbs me. I speed-walk past flowers on bridges and gated graveyards while others stop to pay their respects. When I think of the dead, I see myself among them. I would trade my life for my Asian American siblings, if given the chance. There are so many people who could do more with a life than I. But I am never given the chance. I keep living. It’s not fair.
A few days later, I have finally summoned the strength to start knowing. I am reading news articles and shaking in an emotion that won’t come out no matter how much I rattle. I feel guilty. I feel nauseous. I feel like a tightly bound twine ball of wrong. I feel like hair frizzed up by a Van de Graaff ball.
I am here and I am not. I sat at a Zoom vigil for an hour. Three levels of detached. Spiraling around the fixed point in space between my eyes. They played music. For our minute of silent remembrance, they showed the six names we know on plain white slides in default Arial font. When they ran out they flipped through them again. They are syllables that are familiar to me. I love people with names like these.
The New York Times keeps paywalling me. I read the same quotes over and over and I hate them even more every single time. From Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant: “It appears that they may be Asian.” It appears. Appears. White America, you know how Asian we appear to you. You mock us for our yellow skin and slanted eyes and broken accents. From U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken: “We are horrified by this violence which has no place in America or anywhere.” Bull. Your country is built on violence. Violence sprawls out, lounges, reclines all comfortable in America. Possibly the worst, from Cherokee County Sheriff Captain Jay Baker: “Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did.” Fuck you. A bad day is something you fix with a hot cup of tea and a relaxing bath. Your “really bad day” does not justify murder. You know what’s a worse day? Being murdered by a racist scumbag who feels entitled to play god with minority lives.
I think about the people who have died. In my mind, they look like me, or maybe my aunties and relatives back in China. People with calloused hands. Tired after long days of work. Looking forward to going home to the families they’re supporting.
I have no coherence to offer you. I have no five-paragraph argument for how white America has encouraged violence against Asian Americans, from scapegoating Asian Americans for the coronavirus (or in Donald Trump’s words, the “Chinese virus”) to fetishizing Asian women as docile, submissive, and exotic. I have no numbers for the undue attacks on Asian Americans except “too many.” I cannot lay out exactly how these Atlanta murders fall at the intersection of racism against Asians, misogyny, anti-immigrant sentiment, and stigma around sex work. I do not want to debate America’s culture of violence against the “other” with you. I want to scream. I want you to scream with me.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, the Peabody Museum gained our trust and support with their careful formation of a steering committee, serving as a swift and actionable response to their discovery of potential remains of enslaved people within their museum collections. But today, our faith in the museum has morphed into a tainted brand of withdrawal and doubt, as we are disappointed and appalled to discover that the same level of dedication and care has not been taken with the museum’s treatment of Native American human remains and cultural objects.
This disappointment emerges against the backdrop of the Association on American Indian Affairs’ recent letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, which alleged that Harvard is in violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The letter detailed several legal and ethical missteps in Harvard’s handling of Native American human remains and cultural objects, including a failure to consult with tribal nations when completing inventories of collections.
Regrettably, it is within this context that the museum’s commitment to countering the effects of colonization and fighting broader injustice has begun to appear half-hearted, emerging as a discretionary form of dedication at best, and at worst, as an empty, futile promise.
Perhaps most pernicious about the University not returning such critical remains to their rightful holders is Harvard’s circumvention of the reality that it should not have been able to wield control of these items, to begin with. The University’s claim that these remains are “culturally unidentifiable” is what has allowed Harvard to maintain possession of these sensitive objects for so long. And yet, this claim is based upon a determination process that has excluded the participation of tribes themselves. In fact, of the “culturally unidentifiable” remains in Harvard’s possession, 96.75 percent have geographical identifiers that would enable tribal consultation and repatriation, according to AAIA. Inevitably, this underscores the superficiality of Harvard’s claims that they wholeheartedly seek to grapple with the troubles that have permeated the University’s past and present.
Indeed, the University’s failure to include tribal nations in their object identification process offers a worrisome, glaring testament to the entrenched colonial perceptions that have guided their treatment of rightful Indigenous property. The fact of the matter is that Harvard researchers are not the experts on Indigenous artifacts — tribes are.
Beyond that, all items which were not explicitly donated to Harvard are essentially stolen property — rendering their display not only misguided but dissolute. Even in pixelated form on their website, the University has no right to display the Native American items they possess, many of which are ceremonial and hold sacred value to Indigenous peoples.
To that end, the Peabody Museum must seek out the necessary consultation for these items to be returned to their rightful homes. Beyond that, the Peabody Museum also needs to engage with the more specific demands put forward by AAIA — from hiring an NAGPRA expert to help affiliate all “culturally unidentifiable” objects, to repatriating the countless funerary items it has misguidedly chosen to keep. In its current failure to meet such pressing demands, the Peabody Museum has displayed the same levels of entitlement that have empowered the deceitful acquisition of such precious artifacts in the first place.
For far too long, the Peabody Museum has placed academic research and intellectual inquiry over the most basic, fundamental requisites of restorative justice and decolonization. In fact, the museum’s intellectual pursuits have become dependent upon the imprisonment of Indigenous cultural and spiritual property, with their explorations relentlessly propounding systemic depravities in the name of academia. As we consider such realities, the museum’s past promises and attempts to reform their academic operations — such as their expressed efforts to more effectively consider the needs of tribal nations within their institutional framework — begin to seem glaringly unpropitious, as they do nothing to address the inherently problematic backbone of the museum’s overarching intellectual mission.
Beyond that, it is impossible to overlook the stark contrast between the museum's reactivity in responding to Native demands and their proactivity in beginning to repatriate the remains of enslaved people found in their collections. Indeed, in response to increasingly loud objections and demands, the University has begun to bolster its commitment to reckoning with its sordid ties to the institution of slavery; but still, it has markedly failed to extend that same consciousness to Harvard’s less discussed — yet equally perturbing — history of settler colonialism. Indigenous people hold substantially less agency within Harvard’s political framework, and these power dynamics are reflected in the Peabody’s neglect of their concerns.
Moving forward, it is our sincerest hope that the University develop better practices to acknowledge its part in a long, difficult history of institutional and physical violence against Indigenous people. This work must begin with meeting the immediate demands asked of the Peabody, but it also requires a much larger reconciliation: a reckoning with the implications of being situated on the traditional and ancestral lands of the Massachusett people and a genuine effort to dismantle the inflammatory missteps that have, as it stands, served to aggravate the traumas of a cruel and unrelenting past.
The Peabody Museum cannot serve an ethical and academic purpose so long as it remains a crime scene.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dr. Ambreen Zaman Riaz was impressed by the restaurant. “It was a sushi place,” she says, “and it was really good by the way, really good sushi.” But it was the company, not the food, that surprised her. The restaurant wasn’t segregated by sex or gender — a true rarity in Saudi Arabia. The Kingdom was modernizing before her own eyes.
Over a sometimes glitchy Zoom call, Zaman Riaz, then a Harvard graduate student, recounted the details of her April 2018 visit to the Saudi Kingdom. The trip, organized by the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center’s Project on Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council Security in collaboration with Gateway KSA, sent eleven Harvard students on a nine-day-long academic and cultural exchange mission. It was only one of Harvard’s many ties to the Saudi Kingdom in the months leading up to journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s assassination — ties that included, among others, a multimillion-dollar history of gifts, an official campus visit by Prince Mohammed bin Salman that same March, and even direct collaboration with Saudi policymakers through the Kennedy School’s Evidence for Policy Design project.
Yet the trip, like most of our institutional ties to Riyadh, proved complicated at best.
For one, there was the self-policing. Zaman Riaz’s research, which she presented at a meeting with students from Effat University, a university for women in Jeddah, focused on female empowerment. Her workshop-based research featured the kind of insights and ingrained value judgments that run brazenly counter to official Saudi policy — which is exactly why Zaman Riaz felt the need to carefully tone them down, to ensure that they didn’t prove “too controversial” or “aggressive.” She thinks she was hardly the only Harvard expat biting her tongue — doing so was the norm within the delegation. “We definitely felt that we had to hold quite a few things back,” she says.
At the same time, Zaman Riaz was frustrated by what she deemed the forced “touristy,” overly positive nature of the trip, which included visits to archeological sites and several major cities, as well as a reception with the trip’s host, Prince Turki al-Faisal. And while relatively (and sadly) radical improvements like the sushi bar struck her, Zaman Riaz felt like she got a purposefully warped glimpse of her host country. The social advancements she witnessed (or, rather, the social advancements that were carefully placed within her sight) seemed more like “window dressing,” or “sort of a façade.” A set of carefully cherry-picked indicators of change.
When asked whether she felt like she’d met the real Saudi Arabia, her answer was an unequivocal no.
Zaman Riaz’s account isn’t exactly surprising — self-censorship and rose-tinted tours are almost a given when visiting authoritarian countries. It’s even less surprising given the trip's co-host, Gateway KSA, an organization financially backed by state-controlled Saudi corporations, has recently drawn scrutiny for gifting influencers all-expenses-paid trips to Saudi Arabia in exchange for glowing coverage. The group isn’t exactly subtle about its image-laundering efforts either — its website names “influencers, policymakers, and leaders of tomorrow” who can “see beyond today’s headlines and tweets” as its target audience.
So Harvard put together a glamorous trip to Saudi Arabia, one that was characterized by soft propagandistic efforts and the reflexive self-imposed boundaries on the participants' speech. That much is as obvious as it is predictable; a logical continuation of our University’s outreach to a number of less than democratic countries. The more relevant question is whether such ventures are ever a net good.
Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former CIA intelligence officer and the senior fellow at the Belfer Centre who led the trip, thinks they are. He is also, refreshingly enough, one of the few people willing to defend academic endeavors like the 2018 trip, while still candidly acknowledging the ways in which they may benefit an existing regime.
Mowatt-Larssen’s perspective on the trip is at times more optimistic than Zaman Riaz’s — he recounts, for example, how while grabbing a beer at the airport, the attendees shared their appreciation for the lack of an overt propagandistic “trap” within the visit. Mowatt-Larssen was actually surprised by the extensive leeway he and the other Harvard affiliates were granted in terms of speech. But he’s still realistic about their hosts’ motivation. “The Saudi government was trying to encourage all this because it wants to increase interaction between Saudi citizens and institutions and academia. So we were, Harvard was, very much a test case. Again, I was very comfortable — Harvard was very comfortable with it,” he says in an interview.
More crucially, he thinks that allowing Saudi Arabia to present itself to the world in an idealized fashion meant that the regime actually had to prepare something to show; to engage in some reform, even if just for purely performative reasons. Mowatt-Larssen uses a briefing the group received from “a group of Saudi female officers” on anti-terrorism as an example. “Obviously, it was a show in a sense, but it was real, too,” Mowatt-Larssen says. The government's outward-facing mimicry had positive effects on some of its actual people; the quest to unrealistically portray their own society forced officials to accept some change.
But when the curtain falls, the show remains nothing but a show.
The very same prince that once hosted the Harvard delegation, the one who offered our students a grand, relatively uncensored dinner, finds himself in the headlines, months later, for casting doubt on the CIA’s account of Khashoggi’s murder. The sushi restaurant and female officers become but positive outliers against a mortally misogynistic backdrop. Reality returns, unchanged.
Mowatt-Larssen knows that much — perhaps on a deeper, personal level, having personally known Jamal Khashoggi. Harvard knows it too: Prince Turki was soon disinvited from one of his regular visits to our campus; and the Belfer Center’s Saudi Project, along with its delegation aspirations, ended months after the debacle. Harvard Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith declined to comment on the matter. The journalist's assassination shone a bright, harsh light on the realities of the Saudi Kingdom that marginal benefits of a trip like intercultural engagement simply couldn’t justify. A red line was crossed, and productive engagement was no longer a possibility.
But why was the line drawn there of all places? Why was a new development more powerful than years worth of fiercely misogynistic authoritarianism?
How do we decide when the ethical ticket price is too much for the show?

{image id=1343662 size=large byline=true caption="Media experts spoke about the outsize role conspiracy theories currently play in U.S. society and media coverage at a Tuesday event hosted by the Kennedy School.}
Journalists and media experts discussed digital misinformation, conspiracy theories, and their implications at a Harvard Kennedy School panel event Tuesday.
The event — titled “The Proliferation of Networked Conspiracies Online” — featured Brandy Zadrozny, an NBC investigative reporter; David S. Rohde, online news director for the New Yorker; and Brian T. Friedberg, a senior researcher for the Technology and Social Change research project at the Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center. Joan M. Donovan, the Shorenstein Center’s Research Director on Media, Politics and Public Policy, moderated the conversation.
Donovan opened the discussion by examining the relationship between the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and right-wing conspiracy theories.
Rohde said the insurrection highlighted the fallibility of the “can’t happen here” logic, which leads many Americans to assume that U.S. institutions are safe from the threat of conspiracies.
“I’ve written about this thought that our institutions were stronger, that conspiracy theories couldn’t lead to violence here — let alone an effort to reverse the outcome of a presidential election online and on live, cable TV — but we are no different,” Rohde said.
Zadrozny said the media industry recently experienced an “awakening” regarding the power of QAnon, militias, and similar networked conspiracies.
“That actually concerns me,” she added. “There’s a danger in giving too much airspace to what happened on the 6th and giving too much oxygen to these smaller communities.”
Friedberg also said he is concerned that conspiracy theories receive too much media coverage.
“Trump is out of office, and we have to read just what we center our media on,” Friedberg said. “It’s time to start taking this apart rather than reinforcing it.”
According to Friedberg, conspiracy groups exploit anti-Black racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and transphobia.
“All those are really animating cultural issues that have a conspiratorial underlay,” Friedberg said.
Friedberg said he believes the Jan. 6 insurrection highlights the growing power conspiracies possess over today’s contentious political landscape.
Panelists also shared ideas on how to combat misinformation.
“My main, simplistic answer is more transparency: more transparency from the news media, more transparency from the CIA, more transparency from Congress,” Rohdes said.

Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine saw a 19.3 percent and 13.0 percent uptick, respectively, in completed applications during this year’s admissions cycle.
The surge in applicants to Harvard aligns with national trends in medical school admissions. The Association of American Medical Colleges reported an 18 percent increase in medical school applications this year compared to the previous year.
In contrast to this year, the number of completed applications to the Medical School has been “stable” for the past five years, according to HMS admissions dean Robert J. Mayer.
Mayer said he believes the increase in HMS applications “has something to do with the pandemic,” though he added that it is “premature” to conclude that Covid-19 influenced people’s desire to enter medicine.
“There are some who say this reflects the desire of a lot of young people because of Covid to enter medicine, which I hope will turn out to be true,” Mayer said. “But I think it’s very premature to base that on this increase because people who weren’t planning to go to medical school and decide they want to need a year or two to take premedical courses and prepare for it."
The cancellation of jobs, fellowships, and research opportunities due to the pandemic may also explain why HMS experienced an influx in applications, per Mayer. College graduates who had originally planned to take time off between college and medical school to pursue non-academic opportunities may have instead decided to immediately apply to medical school, Mayer suggested.
Mayer and HSDM admissions director Sarah Troy-Petrakos both said their admissions offices adjusted application requirements as the pandemic unfolded.
According to Troy-Petrakos, the HSDM Admissions Office was “as flexible and understanding as possible” of applicants who had their Dental Admission Tests delayed, were unable to shadow in person, or had difficulty obtaining letters of recommendation.
HSDM addressed those issues by extending its application deadline, accepting pass-fail grades for prerequisite classes, waiving letters of recommendation if they were unobtainable, and accepting unofficial standardized test scores until official reports could be submitted.
HMS Admissions also attempted to accommodate prospective students whose applications were affected by the pandemic, according to Mayer.
HMS offered more flexible interview times for those in different time zones, accommodated students whose schools transitioned to pass-fail grading systems due to the pandemic, interviewed students before they had their MCAT scores, and extended the application deadline.
Mayer said he hopes the global health crisis will inspire more students to consider medicine as a career path.
“Medicine has never been a more attractive exciting and timely profession, and I think the experience with Covid — in terms of humanism, in terms of science, in terms of pointing out what works in our society and what doesn't work in our society — has been eye opening for many,” Mayer said. “I hope that people will continue to apply and choose medicine as a career path.”

A team of Harvard School of Public Health researchers released preliminary data on March 9 from their digital women’s health study, which aims to destigmatize the menstrual cycle and advance female reproductive health science.
Sponsored by Apple, the study included over 10,000 women across the U.S. who were asked to track their menstrual cycles and complete health surveys through Apple’s Research app. The study — a collaboration between HSPH, Apple, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences — analyzed how women’s health and behaviors affect their menstrual cycles.
“By building a robust generalizable knowledge base, the Apple Women’s Health Study is helping us understand factors that make menstruation difficult and isolating for some people, in addition to elevating awareness of a monthly experience shared by women around the world,” said Michelle Williams, dean of the faculty of the School of Public Health, in a March 9 press release.
Of the symptoms reported by participants, abdominal cramps were the most commonly tracked, with 83 percent reporting. Bloating and tiredness followed with 63 and 61 percent, respectively.
Others reported symptoms including acne, headache, mood and appetite changes, lower back pain, breast tenderness, diarrhea, sleep changes, constipation, and nausea.
Menstrual symptoms were a “shared experience” across different age, race, and geographic location demographics, according to School of Public Health professor Shruthi Mahalingaiah, one of the researchers involved in the study who specializes in reproductive and women’s health.
“We concluded that the period symptoms are a shared experience, at least in this view,” Mahalingaiah said. “Not only are they shared, there’s a very wide range of symptoms that a person can experience.”
The research team intends to integrate data gathered from surveys, medical records, and phone sensors that measure heart rate and other physiologic conditions, said Brent A. Coull, School of Public Health professor of biostatistics and another research team member.
“One thing that’s really exciting is going to try to integrate those different sources of data and combine the strengths of all three types of data to really get a better handle of women's behaviors and lifestyles and also health conditions and how that might contribute overall to their health,” Coull said.
Coull added that the researchers hope to continue the study over an extended period of time to gain more data.
“We really want the study to be broad-based,” Coull said. “We want it to reflect the national population of women, so that it can be generalizable to entire populations.”
In addition to informing the development of products for menstrual health and gynecologic screening, the researchers said, the study's findings may also serve to reduce stigma around menstrual health.
“By studying it, and also creating interfaces where we can share our discovery in a publicly digestible way — so not a research article, but something where it’s relatable to the participant or potential participant — is something I think can help destigmatize menstruation and the process of sharing,” Mahalingaiah said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 100 Harvard faculty members and nine local elected officials backed a complaint filed with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s office last week challenging the legality of the University's investment in fossil fuels.
The complaint, filed by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard — a student group calling for the University to divest from fossil fuels — alleges Harvard is in violation of the Massachusetts Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act, which requires nonprofits to invest with charitable purposes in mind.
Nine elected officials — including four Cambridge city councilors, a pair of state representatives, and Boston mayoral candidate Michelle Wu ’07 — signed onto the original complaint, which was filed to Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92 on March 15.
“If a nonprofit organization with a $40 billion endowment can’t afford to divest from fossil fuels and transition to more sustainable energy, who can?” said Cambridge City Councilor Jivan G. Sobrinho-Wheeler, one of the complaint’s signatories.
Sobrinho-Wheeler signed onto the complaint along with Cambridge City Councilors Marc C. McGovern, Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, and Quinton Y. Zondervan. Sobrinho-Wheeler, who has previously supported the divestment movement, said he was contacted by Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard and asked to support the effort.
“It really raises questions about why not,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said of divestment. “Is this really in the best interest of the folks that Harvard has a legal responsibility to represent?”
State Representatives Nika C. Elugardo and Erika Uyterhoeven — both of whom attended graduate school at Harvard — also backed the complaint.
Wu, who currently serves on the Boston City Council and is a frontrunner in this summer’s mayoral election, also signed on to a similar complaint filed against Boston College by activists at the school in December.
“It’s important to follow the lead of youth activists and to center this generation in taking action on the big issues that sit squarely on all of our futures,” Wu wrote in an email to The Crimson. “Let’s divest from fossil fuels and invest in the next generation.”
More than 115 Harvard faculty members signed on to a public letter backing the complaint. The letter states that Harvard’s investments contradict “our mission as scholars and teachers and endangers the future of the university.”
Regina C. LaRocque, one of roughly 60 Harvard Medical School faculty members who signed the letter, said it is “counterproductive” for the University to continue to invest in fossil fuels.
“It’s quite clear, at this point, that we can no longer continue to extract fossil fuels,” she said. “It is a dead, or dying, industry.”
“As a doctor, I can say very clearly that the continued combustion of fossil fuels represents an immediate health threat to the students of the University right now,” LaRocque added. “I think it is our ethical responsibility as an academic institution that knows the science behind this to not continue to associate itself with this industry.”
James M. Recht, an assistant professor of psychiatry at HMS who signed onto the faculty letter, said Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard's decision to file a complaint with the attorney general of Massachusetts “makes a lot of sense” because of its ability to raise public awareness.
“It provides an opportunity for the authors of the letter to explain to the public why and how the University is violating its fiduciary responsibilities by refusing to divest from this corrupt industry,” he said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton defended Harvard’s investment practices in an emailed statement.
“The way in which the University invests the endowment is consistent with its charitable mission, as well as our fiduciary obligation,” he wrote.
Fossil fuels are currently valued at less than 2 percent of the University’s endowment, which the complaint estimates amounts to $838 million. The Harvard Management Company is in the process of moving to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which it argues will have a greater impact on reducing overall emissions.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said Harvard’s students and workers should play a larger role in the University's decision-making process to create “democracy in the workplace.”
“I think it’s leading the way, pushing for a more democratic, more accountable university,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said of the divestment movement. “Harvard, like any institution, should be governed by the people who make it up, and so students really fighting to see that accountability is incredibly important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers found that partisan sorting — the geographic segregation of individuals belonging to different political parties — occurs not only on the regional, state, and county level, but even within cities and neighborhoods.
Using voter file data of 180 million voters and spatial data computational techniques, Government Ph.D. candidate Jacob R. Brown and Government professor Ryan D. Enos determined that city- and neighborhood-level sorting between Democrats and Republicans is present throughout the United States. The phenomenon limits many Americans from gaining exposure to people with differing opinions, potentially fueling polarization within the United States.
The study — published in Nature Human Behavior this month — found that an average of just three out of 10 interactions in a residential environment for both the median Democrat and median Republican will be with a neighbor belonging to a different political party. Ten percent of Democrats have virtually no exposure to Republicans, according to the study.
“It seems that, on average, a Democrat or Republican who live in the same town still have noticeably different neighbors,” Brown said. “The Republican within that town will cluster around a few more Republican neighbors than the Democrat will, and the Democrats around a few more Democratic neighbors than the Republican will.”
“I assumed it was mostly at a higher level,” he added.
Partisanship is correlated with density, with Democrats typically living in more densely populated regions and Republicans living in more rural and suburban areas. The study not only supports this idea, but illustrates the severe extent to which people are isolated from voters of the other party.
Enos said the unexpected finding that partisan bubbles were forming at lower levels was particularly interesting because within smaller localities, density is typically constant.
The effects of people living grouped by partisanship remains unknown, but the negative consequences of people grouping by race and religion have been documented in studies, per Enos.
“We know that when groups are segregated, that it’s associated with a lot of negative outcomes,” he said. “It can be things like whether or not they cooperate, whether or not they remain peaceful, or whether or not they like each other.”
Brown said he thinks it is important for Americans to be exposed to different views in their daily lives.
“We don’t want to limit that kind of information and we want a clear perspective on both sides, whether it’s through your online network or day-to-day geographic network,” Brown said.
“You can imagine if you don’t get to interact with Democrats as a Republican — you don’t interact with Democrats in your day-to-day life — you might rely on nationalized stereotypes when thinking of the other party,” he added.
Enos said segregation tends to be a self-perpetuating feedback loop, which complicates the question of how to best address the issue.
“The thing about segregation is once segregation starts, it actually tends to accelerate, it tends to become more severe, and it becomes self-reinforcing,” Enos said.
The study is part of Brown and Enos’s larger Partisan Segregation Project that seeks not only to produce empirical evidence about geopolitics, but also tackle questions such as why the parties are separated and how this phenomenon has changed over time.
“We want to know everything about why it’s happening and then as much as we can about the consequences of it,” Brown said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As part of their third meeting together, the Harvard-Allston Task Force and the developers of the Harvard-owned land at 180 Western Ave. mulled the project’s public spaces and sustainability at a virtual meeting Tuesday.
Per the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the proposed seven-story development at Barry’s Corner will span 200,000 square feet — with 273 units of housing and space for ground-floor shops and restaurants.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force is a group of local residents and Harvard affiliates that meets regularly to discuss development projects in the area. Tuesday’s meeting comes two months after the task force’s last meeting, during which developers and stakeholders focused on the project’s access to green space and level of affordability.
On March 5, developer Samuels and Associates filed its project notification form with the BPDA, which is open for public comment until early April. This filing, along with the meetings with stakeholders, represents an important step the developers must take before seeking approval of their plans from the BPDA board.
David P. Manfredi, CEO of design firm Elkus Manfredi Architects, opened the developers’ presentation, focusing on the existing plans detailed in the project notification form for open space at 180 Western Ave. and informing the task force of new alternatives.
Manfredi said the developers’ March filing stated the project will include “public realm all the way around the site” and expand the existing sidewalk to “17 to 21 feet.”
One alternative to that plan, according to Manfredi, is to increase the sidewalk space along North Harvard Street by 34 percent compared to the proposal in the project notification form. Such an alternative would open up the area planned as a “privatized café zone” to the public, Manfredi said. The plan would also increase the number of benches and allow for the planting of additional trees.
The other option the developers are considering is converting an area previously planned for private building amenities into public space along Bertram Street, which would increase outdoor space by 42 percent, according to Manfredi.
Residents of 180 Western Ave. would still have access to a rooftop gathering space on the second floor, he added.
Following Manfredi’s discussion of open space, Emily Paparella, vice president at Elkus Manfredi, outlined the developers’ plans around the sustainability of the project.
In addition to solar panels which will be installed on the development’s rooftop, residential units will rely on electricity for utilities, rather than gas, she said.
Per the developers’ slideshow, “all electric residential units” would result in a “27.5 percent” decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.
Task force member Christine A. Varriale pushed back on the developers’ “all electric residential units” plan, asking whether gas would still be the building’s main source of power as she said is the case at the nearby Continuum building.
In response to Varriale, Paparella said gas would heat the “common corridors” under the development’s current design.
Both Varriale and task force member Barbara Parmenter said they would prefer gas not be used as a power source at all.
Additionally, task force member Tim McHale said he hopes the developers will encourage more “cultural activity” in the development’s public spaces. He added that he would like to see a “lively community gathering spot,” which he thinks could be “the real signature for Barry’s Corner.”
Paula Alexander, a local resident who is not on the task force, expressed trepidation about the new activity the development would bring and said that a “seven-story-plus building looming over” Allston is “not something we want to see.” She added that she feels her concerns are being “ignored.”
“I’m tired of squeaking all the time,” she said. “But the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and I’m going to keep squeaking until I get some action.”
Part of the purpose for these meetings and public comment on the developers’ filings is to compile resident feedback that the developers will address in future filings, according to BPDA project manager Nupoor Monani.
“We’re creating a feedback loop,” she said. “[The developers] share something with us, which was the PNF, we collect the feedback from you all and our colleagues, give it back to the development team, and then they use that to send in another filing that answers the questions we are raising today.”

Gone are the days when you could put on your coolest pants and fanciest coat and stage a one-person fashion show between the B and C aisles in Annenberg. Eating inside is so 2019, and we’re all about that newness. Meals can still be your personal Eleganza if you want them to be, so read on for some outfits fresher than Red’s best.
A Harvard sweater, with a button down layered beneath, some ~capital-t~ Trousers and loafers.
This is the TikTok watching, Pinterest stalking, soft academia lewk of your dreams. Add some chains to show that you might be a Harvard student, but you’re definitely a cool kid. Accidentally disconnect your headphones while grabbing your food so that everybody knows you’re listening to SZA, and keep your backpack unzipped so the person behind you can see all the books you’re reading.
Your Best Going Out Look
Little dress and heels! Jersey and a cap! That one button down you have that does double time for job interviews and “Risky Business” parties! Since you're not going to be busting down in the Mather JCR anytime soon, strut your stuff on your way to get your Seitan Sizzle. Now that’s hot.
A DHA sweatshirt and sweats.
Either a flex about your athletic ability OR a flex about your ability to abscond with someone else's sweatshirt. If it's the latter, wear running shoes, just in case the person you stole the sweatshirt from is on the track team and you're going to have to beat them at a 50-yard dash to keep the spoils of your robbery.
An outfit inspired by the actual food itself
Red's Best is obviously head to toe crimson, and a breakfast banana doesn't take too much creativity either. But a whoopie pie? Gnocchi? Sauteed spinach with garlic? Farro with roasted zucchini, squash, eggplant, and celery? The options never fail to excite. And don't forget to subscribe to Harvard Today to be notified of the day's theme.
Absolutely nothing except some HUDS napkins to cover your naughty bits and a face mask. 
Reduce, reuse, recycle, and in this ensemble, you'll show what an absolute eco-warrior you are. Cheeky!
Regardless of what you wear, wear a mask and bring a thank you for the HUDS workers. :-)
