After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PARIS, France–Good, affordable housing in Paris is a real problem. I’ve been in Paris for less than a month, and I’ve already switched four times. In the process, I have slowly and painfully accumulated some wisdom that I would now like to share.
1. Never take a chambre de bonne, no matter how good of a deal it may seem. They are relatively inexpensive, but they are usually on the top floor of the buildings, so although the view is great, during the summer it is very, very hot. There is also just enough space for a bed and your American suitcase, but not for you, unless you are in the bed. Although “bonne” means good in French, chambre de bonne does not translate as “good room,” but as “maid’s room,” and there definitely is a difference. Although the life of 19th century maids in Paris may seem fascinating according to Alexandre Dumas, their accommodations were definitely not.
2. Moving in with a wonderful French ex – also not a good idea. This holds true even if you can see the Eiffel tower from three windows of his apartment, and the place is twenty times bigger than the last room you stayed in. You can cook together, go out together, and by French standards, it’s completely normal to be good friends with your ex.  But you can do that without living together. For me, this only lasted three days.
3. As you move out of your ex’s place, and want your privacy without feeling isolated from city life, a residence might sound quite appealing. You might think that you could meet other French students, be around young people, assimilate into the culture more, go out together, and so on. All this might be true as long as you don’t get a residence for nurses without actually being, or at least aspiring to be, a nurse. I made that mistake when agreeing to be placed into Jerome Le Jeune. The place felt very much like a hospital with its blank walls, intense cleanliness and even pitiable garden in the concrete, which makes you think of a dying person’s last sigh as they look at a little blue flower. Coincidentally, in Jerome Le Jeune there were also rooms for retired old ladies. French old ladies are friendly and love to chat, but French nurses are very exclusive. In fact, in the very liberal, open-minded country of France, I was discriminated against for not being a nurse. They could do yoga classes in the garden, and I could not. Nurses could put an extra bed in their room, and I could only use one. They could spend nights around a piano singing Édith Piaf songs, and I could not join! (And after all Parisian nightlife doesn’t get any more exciting than that). The French administration also apparently cares for the purity of their nurses. There were no visitors allowed in the residence at all, and especially not men. (I thought this place was for nurses, not Vestal Virgins). The girls were supposed to return home before 1 am every night, which by Parisian standards is very early. And just to make sure that I don’t ruin the delightful Puritan atmosphere, every few days they would tape random notices on the doors of the few lucky international students with big red letters in English: “Mademoiselles! This is a first warning. No drugs. No alcohol. No returning home late. Don’t make noise.” For only 100 euros more, I eventually escaped to my own studio.
4. I was so ready to leave Jerome Le Jeune that I took the first nice-looking studio I was offered. It is near the metro stop Alésia, and in a lovely neighborhood. There is a café on one corner, a boulangerie on the other, and a bookstore right in front. There is more than enough space and a great atmosphere. But two very important things are missing: air conditioning and wireless internet. In my two days here, I have found partial (that is, very partial) solutions to both. I made friends with my neighbors across the hall, a nice elderly couple, and we decided to both keep all our doors and windows open so that air can circulate between the two apartments. However, the same elderly couple told me that if I tap into their Wifi, their television would explode. Then my first night, when walking down the stairs, I noticed that the neighbor below had left her key in the door lock. I knocked and gave her the key. She was so grateful she gave me her Wifi password. Unfortunately, the signal is not too strong. It only works in the hall, so that’s where I’ve been spending some time. French neighbors look at me curiously and step over me as I write art history papers and Skype in Russian. What can I say, it’s a great way to meet people. A real conversation starter.

JUNE 28, 2010
BEIJING, China—In a surprising development for a young economy, China is on its way to becoming a global environmental leader. Ernst and Young’s May report on renewable energy now ranks China and the United States in a tie as the world’s best destinations for investment in clean energy. China has made considerable headway to create a favorable environment for clean energy through forward-looking government policy, and seems likley to be a leader in the field over the coming decade. These impressive steps will strengthen economic growth and environmental protection. If the United States does not do the same, it risks losing a chance to lead an enormous new industry and solidify secure energy sources to meet future needs.
China’s role as a prime destination for investment in clean energy comes after a frenzy of intelligent economic policy and action. According to the Ernst and Young report, in 2009, China invested $34.9 billion in clean energy, almost twice as much as the United States’ commitment of  $18.6 billion. China is now the world’s leading producer of wind turbines and solar panels, and “is pushing equally hard to build nuclear reactors and the most efficient types of coal power plants” according to The New York Times. Companies from around the world are building factories in China and purchasing renewable energy parts from China, making it a central location in the world’s energy supply chain. Not only this, but the city of Tianjin is starting a pilot carbon cap-and-trade system and Beijing and Shanghai hope to do so as well. China seems to be on its way to becoming the Saudi Arabia of clean energy, holding all the keys to a crucially valuable resource.
China is motivated in a large part by energy security, the concern that its energy supply comes from dangerous and unstable parts of the world. The United States faces similar challenges. It too must deal with unreliable oil and natural gas suppliers in the Middle East and South America, and renewable energy gives us the opportunity to build new, clean sources right at home. But unlike China, our government cannot command transition to clean energy; rather, we must use legislation to take this integral step. A climate bill that put a price on carbon would create the incentives to develop clean energy, but if we don’t soon take action, we will have to transition from depending on dictatorships for oil to depending on China for clean energy as fossil fuels run their course.

KWAZULU-NATAL, South Africa—I never expected the sound I would associate with my time in South Africa to be that of a cheap, obnoxious, plastic trumpet. But since the first week of my two-month stay in KwaZulu-Natal, vuvuzela have been the soundtrack of my summer.
Since the beginning of June, nearly every conversation I’ve had in South Africa has been about one of two things—the paperwork I’m doing in the HIV clinic where I work, or the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The breakdown of the evening news is as follows: 15 minutes on the World Cup, five minutes on business, five minutes on other sports, and five minutes on the weather. In South Africa this summer, there is no other news. The World Cup is that big, and no matches have been bigger than the trio played by Bafana Bafana, South Africa’s beloved national team.
The men of Bafana Bafana had the tallest of orders ahead of them—defy all reasonable expectations and advance to the knockout round against the likes of international powers Uruguay, Mexico, and France. Were they able to do it? Not quite, but by beating France and drawing with Mexico, they sure did come close. But for me, and for thousands of South Africans everywhere, the moment I will remember most is that instant where anything seemed possible.
In the tournament’s opening match, Bafana Bafana squared off with Mexico—a team which, on paper, it didn’t stand an ice cube’s chance in hell of beating. The Mexicans dominated the first half of play, and I thought South Africa was lucky to escape the first half with a 0-0 scoreline.
But near the beginning of the second half, everything changed. Siphiwe Tshabalala streaked up the left side of the pitch, and suddenly everyone in the room was on their feet. One strike and the ball crossed in front of the goalie, landing squarely in the top right corner of the net. A beautiful goal, I thought to myself. And then everyone in the hospital foyer, where I was watching the game with the staff and inpatients, went mad. There was screaming, jumping, and hugging. Nurses ran around grabbing their yellow jerseys and dancing. Even my summer roommate, who admits she had never before been excited about an athletic contest, was into it. We opened the doors and heard the chorus of dozens of vuvuzelas echoing off the hills, united behind this little team that could.
Although Bafana Bafana is out of contention for the title, the sense of unity in South Africa hasn’t dissipated. The country, carrying the burden of the whole continent on its shoulders, is determined to put on the best show possible. As Ghana makes its run through the knockout rounds, commentators have now taken to calling this “Africa’s World Cup,” and even I, a staunch American supporter, will be hard-pressed not to support the Black Stars in the quarterfinals—even after they ousted my squad on Saturday night in overtime.
In South Africa, more than anywhere else I’ve ever been, sport is bringing people together. You can hear it in the vuvuzelas that ring out from children’s soccer games and from taxi windows. Now, with the world cup completed, there has been more excitement for other soccer teams around the world, but nothing can compare to the sheer elation of South Africans when that first goal hit the back of the net.
 
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: July 15, 2010
An earlier version of the opinion piece "POSTCARD: The Men of Bafana Bafana" incorrectly referred to the Ghana national soccer team as "Black Star." The correct name is the Black Stars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Colombian journalist who had been invited to serve as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard for the 2010-2011 academic year applied for a student visa to enter the United States but was denied on “security and related grounds.”
Hollman Morris Rincon—one of the 25 journalists awarded the prestigious Nieman Foundation fellowship for the upcoming year—is a preeminent human rights reporter and producer of an independent television news program called “Contravia.”
Those rallying behind Morris’ entry into the United States have not been able to grasp fully the reasoning behind the denial of his visa, due to the lack of information the U.S. Department of State has been willing to release, according to Joel C. Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
“[He] is being excluded from entering the United States based on information that is apparently confidential,” said Simon, who has been working with the Nieman Foundation to grant Morris entry into the country.
Robert H. Giles, the curator of the Nieman Foundation, said that he has called upon several journalism and human rights organizations to appeal to the Department to reconsider Morris’ application. No other Nieman fellow has been denied a visa by the U.S. government, though visa applications have seen delays in the past.
Giles said he suspected that a possible reason Morris was denied the visa was the journalist’s critical coverage of Colombia President Álvaro Uribe Vélez’s administration. Morris’ connections with sources not in support of the outgoing president could have been interpreted as “terrorist activities,” Giles said.
Bruce Shapiro, executive director of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma—which is also working on the Morris situation—said that the nature of Morris’ work has subjected the Human Rights Watch award-winning journalist to numerous threats on his life. Morris has been involved in investigating the Colombian intelligence agency and has reported on the victims of the civil war in Colombia.
In hopes of bolstering the credibility of Morris’ journalism, Nieman fellows in the class of 1988 are collaborating on a letter to their classmate and president-elect of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos. Though Santos serves as the Minister of Defense under Uribe, he was also a journalist and sub-director of El Tiempo, the family-owned newspaper with the largest circulation in the country.
Morris was already a “relatively frequent” visitor to the United States prior to the recent visa application, according to Shapiro. Morris had spent a week at the Dart fellowship in 2008 and even testified at a congressional subcommittee meeting in D.C.
“My view is that there’s something wrong with the process when one of the most distinguished, independent human rights journalists in the world can be labeled a security risk for the United States,” said Shapiro, whose center is a project of the Columbia School of Journalism that provides resources and training for reporters of violence and tragedy.
“It’s very troubling that one of the leading journalists of Colombia and one of the consistent critics of the government is being denied access to a highly competitive fellowship program for which he is qualified,” Simon said.
Giles called the situation ironic, given that the U.S. government—which supports exporting democratic ideals to countries like Colombia—is denying entry to a journalist who shares similar beliefs. The Nieman program would equip Morris to return to his country to continue “the conversation on how to bring peace to society,” Giles said.
“It would serve the United States to have him here as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard,” he added.
“We [journalists] speak truth to power, and that’s what Hollman does,” Shapiro said. “That’s what our First Amendment is supposed to protect and encourage, and that’s what this country has always stood for.”
The Nieman Fellowship Program is a mid-career program for journalists on the domestic and international field. Each year, at least 12 U.S. and 12 international journalists are selected to attend the year-long program at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.
The U.S. State Department declined request for additional information due to “privacy considerations.”
