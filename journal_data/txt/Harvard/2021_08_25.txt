After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School unveiled a new seal Monday, more than five years after the school retired its former one due to its ties to slavery.
The new seal consists of the University’s motto, “veritas,” and “lex et iustitia,” law and justice, inscripted above eight curved lines, which the school said in a press release is “inspired by architectural details found in Austin and Hauser halls.”
In an email to Law School affiliates Monday, Dean John F. Manning ’82 wrote that by including both Latin phrases, the seal’s designers “make explicit” that the institution “stands for truth, law, and justice.”
“I believe that the simple, elegant, and beautiful design of the new shield captures the complexity, the diversity, the limitlessness, the transformative power, the strength, and the energy that the HLS community, in Cambridge and throughout the world, sees in Harvard Law School,” Manning wrote.
Calls for the Law School to alter its seal began in 2015, when students argued that the seal at the time — which contained the crest of the family of Isaac Royall Jr., a slaveholder who endowed the first law professorship at Harvard — upheld the legacy of slavery.
In March 2016, a Law School committee officially recommended to the Harvard Corporation that it remove and replace the seal. The Corporation accepted that recommendation later that month, and the school said it would select a new seal by 2017; it quickly stripped most physical versions of the seal from campus.
It took until 2020, however, for HLS to form a working group to create its new seal. Law School affiliates were invited to share their suggestions with the working group through focus groups, alumni associations, discussions with student government representatives, and an email address for submission ideas.
Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed — who chaired the working group — said in an interview with Harvard Law Today that the new seal “represents the far-reaching nature” of the institution.
“I very much enjoyed hearing other perspectives,” Gordon-Reed said. “There were some things that kept showing up in all the groups — the focus and the size and breadth of the school, the diversity of the classes offered.”
Manning wrote in his email that the working group “widely solicited the views of our large and diverse community.”
“Over the span of well over a year, it conducted more than a dozen focus groups with faculty, students, staff, and alumni,” Manning wrote.
The working group wrote in its final report that while there was no singular agreement on how the new seal should be designed, three “common conceptual threads” stood out: a “diverse and pluralistic community,” “leadership that changes the world for the better,” and the “fundamental pursuit of law and justice.”
“I am grateful to our community for taking part in this important process and for the values and aspirations they ascribe to HLS — excellence, diversity, pluralism, transformation, leadership, contribution, impact, and the ideals of law and justice,” Manning wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former U.S. Representative William M. “Mac” Thornberry and recent U.S. Senate candidate Sarah I. Gideon headline a cohort of six eminent political figures who will serve as resident fellows at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics this fall, the IOP announced Wednesday.
The new set of fellows also includes Ashley Allison, CNN political commentator and former national coalitions director for the Biden-Harris presidential campaign; Holly Kuzmich, executive director of the George W. Bush Institute; Arnon A. Mishkin, director of the Fox News Decision Desk; and Trymaine D. Lee, MSNBC correspondent and host of the podcast Into America. Lee also shared the 2006 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting as part of a team at the Times-Picayune that covered Hurricane Katrina.
In a press release, IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 said the fellows would help reckon with a “critical moment for the future of our democracy.”
“These six Resident Fellows are uniquely prepared for these times,” said Gearan. “They have lived lives of consequence and bring valuable experiences in elected office, public service, activism and journalism to their Study Groups. We are looking forward to their arrival on campus to uplift our mission to inspire students to public purpose.”
Gideon, the former Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, launched a high-profile challenge against Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) last year. While she was ultimately unsuccessful, the race was one of the most expensive and closely watched Senate races of 2020, with more than $106 million raised throughout the campaign.
Thornberry served in Congress from 1995 to 2021 from one of the most Republican districts in the country, chairing the House Armed Services Committee from 2015 to 2019.
The IOP Resident Fellows hold weekly office hours for students and host an eight-week not-for-credit study group. They also serve as guest lecturers for faculty and lead co-curricular activities. This semester will mark a return to in-person programming for the Fellows program.
Nadia R. Douglas ’23 and Victor E. Flores ’24, student co-chairs of the IOP's Fellows and Study Groups, emphasized the importance of the Fellows in the context of today’s social and political challenges.
“With the immense and diverse challenges our country faces today, it is more integral than ever to hear from experts across ideological, racial, gender, and professional backgrounds who have devoted their lives to public service and uplifting their communities,” Douglas and Flores said in the press release.
The six fellows will join the IOP in-person this fall and their study groups will begin the week of Sept. 13.
