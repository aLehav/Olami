After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being gay in New York City is not hard. Just like everybody else, you go about your own business, shove your way into subway cars, and constantly walk at an abnormally fast pace while grumbling about how slowly everyone around you is going about their business. No one is really asking, “Is this guy gay?” New York City offers a sense of normalcy for LGBTQ+ individuals, and that’s the way it should be.
Yet even New York has its demons.
I don’t know if you have ever been called “faggot!” on the New York City subway system. There is no exact way to describe the feeling, but the closest approximation would be to have your blood boiling through your skin, paired with the sensation of a knife stabbing and slowly turning in your stomach, telling you that somehow you are “wrong”—that you do not belong. That scarf you are wearing, the way you talk, the way you walk, the way you laugh, the pitch of your voice—they are all wrong.
It is this kind of prejudice that the LGBTQ+ community and LGBTQ+ organizations (as well as racial, religious, and ethnic groups) point to as the exact reason why hate crime laws, which allow for greater punishments and jail times for crimes committed with prejudice, are in place. They argue not only that crimes committed with prejudice are more harmful to the individual, but that they also victimize the entire community and should be punished more heavily. To many people, this offers at least a modicum of justice to marginalized  communities in an unfair society.
These laws, however, provide anything but justice. Instead, while they may seem easily justifiable, hate crime laws from the federal level to the state level—which have been enforced at Harvard—represent some of the most dangerous, ineffective, and harmful laws our country has instituted.
There is a stunning implication behind hate crime laws that society has failed to contemplate before implementing them.  Normally, violent speech is protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution, unless it can be construed as“fighting words,” or words that can reasonably cause immediate violence. In the case of federal hate crime laws, however, simply having vocalized an opinion about a particular ethnic group, sexual orientation, or other group would increase the maximum punishment to 10 years for most violent crimes. For crimes involving sexual abuse, kidnapping, or death, the sentence can immediately be extended to life in prison.
This, in essence, punishes people for their beliefs, which sets an extremely dangerous precedent for the future. Giving the government the power to sentence people based on their beliefs is a horrifying prospect.  We, however, simply choose not to think about hate crime laws in this manner since we have a sense of apathy towards people who are heading to prison anyways. These statutes thus give dangerously potent powers to the government.
They are also woefully inefficient. It has been known for years that deterrence through lengthened sentences does not function as an effective method for lowering crime rates. Indeed, the weight of empirical evidence supports this fact as it pertains to all crimes, but hate crimes in particular; hate crime legislation simply does not reduce the number of hate crimes.
By adding to people’s sentences, hate crime laws also directly contribute to the problem of mass incarceration, which already has an estimated social cost of $1 trillion per year. Furthermore, they only open the door to harsher crime laws by promoting the “tough-on-crime” mentality that has done so much damage to the United States.
Harvard is guilty of legitimizing these destructive practices of our government. Indeed, the last major crime with hateful motivations at Harvard was investigated as a hate crime by the University Police. In its approval of hate crime laws, Harvard fails to uphold its students’ (even the worst students’) right to think freely.
I am aware that it is all too likely that there will come a time when someone will not just shout “faggot!” at me.  I am aware that it is all too likely that they will throw a punch, grab me, push me to the ground, try to sexually assault me, or maybe even brandish a knife and stab me.
The sadness, pain, and anger that I will experience will be unimaginably agonizing and unbearable. Unfortunately, however, hate crime laws will allow me to inflict far more individual and institutional damage than I myself received.
And that is exactly why they are unacceptable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since November 2016, the University and the Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers have been engaged in a lengthy petition and appeal process with the National Labor Relations Board over the contested validity of the past unionization election. In July, the Regional Director of the NLRB ruled that the eligible voter list generated by Harvard for the election was not complete and accurate, preventing some students from voting. Harvard responded by appealing the decision to the federal NLRB, a majority Republican body that will likely vote against the regional ruling.
We are disappointed that Harvard is playing politics in a cynical and anti-democratic way. Whether intentional or not, their actions have placed the fate of workers rights with a federal board, some of whose members were recently appointed by President Donald Trump and who have little interest in protecting unionization. Harvard should not lean on the NLRB in denying the University’s graduate students and workers the ability to vote fairly on unionization.
We thus urge Harvard to drop the appeal and give students the ability to express their views in another election. Whether a graduate student union is beneficial or not, graduate students deserve a fair election to decide what is best for them. And when hundreds of names are left off of the eligible voter list, as the union claims, a fair election cannot result. We stand by the objections of the union organizers and reaffirm our support for a second vote that uses a complete and accurate list.
If the appeal is successful, the implications for other student unionization efforts and broader union efforts could be hurt nationally. A ruling may try to change the Board law requiring the publication of voter lists, slashing current requirements for employers to compile fair lists and making the process of unionization much less democratic through a lack of open information.
We therefore affirm the stance taken by an op-ed signed by 50 Harvard faculty members: Harvard ought to take the high road and drop its appeal. Students should be able to vote without interference for or against a union. And in any such new election, we hope that the administration will make conditions of eligibility transparent for the sake of a more conclusive vote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You see yourself in the patina that oozes over everything Harvard touches—a funhouse reflection of you, dipped in oil color. The you in this image drips, is smudged, wiped off on the sides of your jeans. It took you three hours and 15 minutes of retail work to pay for them, but as you run your hands down the familiar stitching, the feeling isn’t the same anymore. The reminders of your 30 hour work weeks at 16 years old aren’t as surface-level. Harvard’s name numbs the association, like a painkiller to assuage the past toiling you endured in order to be graced with the ability to exhale its name on the daily. Your fingers trail down the cross-stitches that could’ve been memory lane, but these jeans are now merely a palette to muddy your reflection on, the smell of fresh paint swirling around the stains—but that might just be the drugs kicking in. Placebo or not, the feeling’s kicking in, and you’re wondering whether it’s the denim you can’t feel anymore or your hands.
There is a you buried under this oil sheen, but there is also you that is you lost in the patina, dripping crimson, capitalizing everything you touch. Which one, however, is the real distortion?
Being accepted to Harvard was an incredible feat for every student. Although a wide set of commitments to extracurriculars and academics spread you out thin, the balance was taut, and you came to believe that the foundation of you was laid pretty sturdily for what was to come. However, in the short time you’ve spent at school, you’ve learned to approach things differently. The interactions now are weighted with the pause of social capital, the heaviness of whether a conversation is dotted with friendship or other intentions whereas interactions at home were familiar and required no extra thought. Competition culture here clutches you by the throat almost immediately. Learning how to navigate this school while maintaining the semblance of the you from home can be an Sisyphean feat. The ball may drop, roll onto you. You may be split in two.
The cognitive dissonance of having to shore up two identities is jarring. Many people back home can’t relate to the experiences you’ve had or the opportunities you’ve been afforded; even the way you speak has to be moderated now, trimmed of obscure terminology and an endless list of acronyms for fear of an inability to communicate or the mere reality of sounding pretentious. The “emotional whiplash”, as it were, of having to juggle both of these versions of yourself can take its toll. Students, especially from low-income and/or first generation backgrounds, suffer from this duality, as the difference between Harvard and home is most stark.
However, it is unfair to say that coming to Harvard necessitates splitting one’s self in two. For many, coming here was the expected next step. They never had to worry about the changes that they would experience when they came to Harvard. Their existences have been, to a degree, molded in the image of this lifestyle: having the luxury of having a guide throughout the college process, especially with prior knowledge of the Ivy league experience, helps foster the traits this environment needs from a very young age. Sacrificing a part of their persona was never something they had to consider.
And yet, despite the fact that some escape this burden, the question remains, heavy and ever-present: Do we chose one version of ourselves over the other? Do we give in to the idea of Harvard that others expect us to embody, that we may even expect ourselves to embody—and lose a part of old selves along the way?
Do we have to halve ourselves?
For me, the struggle is not with halving—it is with merging. Half of me is bricks trellised in ivy and opportunity, and the other is bared, raw, weather-worn—a city of bricks that refuses to give credence to the decades it suffered at the hands of opportunists. I should not have to sacrifice one half of me for another for the facade to stand tall, and neither should anyone else.
This experience may be jolting—a coat of crimson blurring the changes between you over the years. Yet, one half of you does not have to crumble under the weight of the other. Sometimes the beauty hidden within this “transformative experience” we’re all expected to have is watching these two halves snake around each other like old lovers until these two halves become a whole, a chimera birthed to the world on commencement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid the frightening festivities of this past Halloweekend, one student organization and a Harvard museum commemorated a different holiday—Día de los Muertos—in vibrant style.
Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is a Mexican holiday that honors those who have passed away. Spanning Oct. 31 to Nov. 2, the holiday recognizes death as a natural part of life and celebrates the deceased with food, drinks, and activities they once enjoyed.
Harvard-Radcliffe RAZA, an organization that represents and celebrates Mexican culture, gathered in Leverett House’s Library Theatre on Thursday to remember loved ones who had passed and to partake in traditional festivities.
RAZA president Bianca I. Rodriguez ’20 described the event as an occasion for people of all backgrounds to honor the memories of those they have lost.
According to Rodriguez, students brought pictures of their loved ones, chatted amongst themselves, and sampled Day of the Dead staples such as pan de muerto, a circular bread specifically eaten for Día de los Muertos and symbolic of the circle of life.
“We decorated the area, we made an altar,” Rodriguez said. “If anyone was comfortable, we would talk about the people they put on the altar and remember a memory they had.”
The Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology hosted a family event on Saturday to celebrate the holiday.
Colorful paper garlands, known as papel picado, hung from the banisters as guests climbed to a massive altar on the third floor dedicated to the victims of a Mexico City earthquake in September, which killed over 200 people.
Mariachi Veritas, a Harvard mariachi group, performed at the event while guests drank Mexican hot chocolate, decorated sugar skulls, and crafted paper marigolds.
Ventura Fabian, a woodcarver from Oaxaca, Mexico, presented a live demonstration of his craft for the event’s guests. Fabian has been practicing the art of traditional woodcarving in his village for over fifty years.
A crowd gathered around Fabian’s son, Norberto Fabian, who painted his father’s woodcarvings and handed his brushes to children who added their own strokes to the woodcarvings.
Norberto Fabian said in Spanish that the most crucial aspect of his participation in this Día de los Muertos event was the opportunity to educate others about his family’s art, culture, and way of life.

With the deadline for sophomores to declare their fields of study fast approaching, The Crimson analyzed nine years of data to find out which concentrations are growing, which are shrinking, and which are holding steady.
Four major trends emerged. The number of students studying applied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics has mushroomed in recent years, while humanities concentrators are winnowing. The traditionally-large social science concentrations—Economics, Government, and Psychology—have fluctuated somewhat, but overall remained relatively stable over the years. So have the Pure Science concentrations, which include chemistry and physics.
For this article, The Crimson analyzed the enrollment statistics for each concentration—excluding joint concentrations—listed in the 2017-2018 Harvard College Handbook. Data on the number of concentrators as of December of the academic year from 2008 to 2016 is publicly available through the handbook website.
Applied STEM
The rise of STEM is clear: Many applied STEM concentrations have experienced significant and consistent growth over the past eight years. Most dramatically, Statistics blossomed from just 17 concentrators in 2008 to 163 in 2016. Computer Science now counts 363 concentrators, up from 86 in 2008, and Applied Mathematics more than doubled in size over that time frame—from 101 to 279 students.
Kevin A. Rader, assistant director of undergraduate studies in Statistics, attributes some of this explosive growth to the fact that Statistics along with other applied STEM concentrations like Computer Science—are a “hot field, and hot job opportunity-wise” right now.
Rader also said that he thought the Statistics department was getting better at attracting concentrators through its introductory classes.
“We’ve been doing a pretty good job getting students interested through introductory courses like Stat 110, Stat 104, things like that,” he said.
Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” the College’s flagship CS course, regularly competes with the introductory economics course to enroll the most undergraduate concentrators.
Humanities
Meanwhile, traditional humanities concentrations like English and Comparative Literature have experienced marked declines in the number of concentrators. English counted 236 concentrators in 2008, and saw decreases in the past seven out of eight years, enrolling 144 concentrators in 2016. Comparative Literature, likewise, shrank from its 2008 size of 48 students to its 2016 size of 16.
Andrew Warren, director of undergraduate studies for the English Department, said that he thought the trend aligns with broader national trends, especially those experienced by peer institutions.
Howard E. Gardner, a professor at the Graduate School of Education, said that the decrease in humanities concentrators is due to undergraduates’ increased emphasis on career training.
“The humanities are going down because people are very job-oriented, either themselves or their parents, so they lack the will or the strength to say, ‘this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expand and try things out, even if they don’t lead to an immediate return on investment,” Gardner said.
Warren said the decrease in concentrators may be connected to the economic downturn in 2008, which he speculated may have led students to seek more remunerative careers.
“The common wisdom is that the decline in majors in English across the country is associated with economic trends,” Warren said.
Warren also said that part of the decline in English concentrators may be due to the decreasing societal salience of literature. “I think literature has less cultural capital than it had 40 or 50 years ago, or certainly 200 years ago,” Warren said.
Warren noted that although there may be a decrease in the number of those concentrating in English, many still take courses in the field: he said that last year, the English Department saw the most students enrolled in its classes since 2009.
Social Sciences
The stalwart social science concentrations—Economics, Government and Psychology—saw some fluctuations over the past eight years, but generally decreased slightly in size. Economics, the largest concentration in the College, saw its peak of concentrators 2008 with 742, and its nadir in 2012 with 568. Since 2012, though, Economics has been steadily growing, counting 662 concentrators in 2016.
The number of Psychology concentrators has remained relatively stable in the time period, with its lows and highs of 255 and 296 concentrators in 2016 and 2014, respectively.
Thomas H. Baranga, Economics concentration advisor, said that Economics may consistently remain such a popular concentration because the College does not offer a formal business degree.
“I’m sure there’s a large section of the population that if they could do a business undergraduate concentration would do that and in the absence of that do Economics,” Baranga said.
He also added that students’ preliminary interest in Economics may arise from how commonly its principles are invoked in political discussions.
“Because both sides of the argument claim to find economic evidence to support their point of view, I’m sure that piques students interest to think, ‘they both can’t be right,’” Baranga said.
The Government Department has had a more pronounced decline in concentrators, decreasing almost every year from its 2008 rate of 477 concentrators to its 2016 rate of 333 concentrators.
Although the number of concentrators have decreased, Gardner said that the social science departments still have a healthy “baseline” pool of concentrators.
“When Economics goes from 700 to 600 that’s noticeable, but when Art History goes from 100 to 30, that’s a headline,” Gardner said.
Pure Sciences 
The pure science concentrations, such as Chemistry and Physics, have attracted relatively stable numbers of concentrators since 2008: Chemistry went from 90 concentrators in 2008 to 80 in 2016, while Physics decreased from 79 concentrators to 61 in the same time frame.
Gardner said this could be attributed in part to the link between students who concentrate in pure sciences and those who plan to apply to medical school.
“The sciences are complicated because of medicine—if people want to go into medicine they have to go into some kind of science, probably biology or chemistry,” he said.
Harvard does not have a pure Biology concentration, but does have Molecular and Cellular Biology, which has overall has averaged a relatively constant number of students. It attracted 162 students in 2008 and 158 in 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A series of discussions and panels will explore everything from consent to sex toys and sexually transmitted infections as part of the College's seventh annual Sex Week.
This program is coordinated by the student-run group Sexual Health Education and Advocacy Throughout Harvard, SHEATH, along with a variety of partners.
The week kicks off with “Protection Methods: Condoms, IUDs, The Pill, Oh My!” and ends a myth-busting panel titled “If I Have Sex Will I Get Pregnant and Die?” Sex Week workshops touch on many aspects of sexual activity, including condoms, consent, and healthy romantic relationships. Organizations inside and outside the University will co-sponsor many of these workshops.
Lita D. Peña ’19, co-president of SHEATH, said that Sex Week aims to inform students and provide a space for open dialogue and questions around sex.
“Oftentimes campus dialogue doesn’t include important aspects of sex, sexuality and sexual health, gender and gender identity, and relationships and intimacy,” Peña said. “These are really complicated conversations and we should be having these conversations more often.”
SHEATH has been working with organizations including the Harvard College Women's Center, Queer Students and Allies, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, Radcliffe Union of Students, Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, the Undergraduate Council, and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. SHEATH also partners with non-Harvard organizations that aim to foster positive discussions surrounding sex.
Good Vibrations, an adult-entertainment store located in Harvard Square, will collaborate with Harvard Sex Week again this year for three events.
Ruby Vail, a Good Vibrations store manager and sex educator, will lead one of the workshops discussing how to express wants and needs in a sexual context. She said her aim is to dismantle the standards in college hookup culture.
“I’d like students to feel empowered to define sex, pleasure, and the kind of sex that they’re having on their own terms and based on what is desirable to them, not on what they think is supposed to be sexy,” Vail said.
Peña described similar hopes of creating a supportive environment for students to have this sort of dialogue. She said that students who come from a more traditional background are often very appreciative of the openness that is emphasized during Sex Week.
“People come up to me after and say, ‘This is so awesome because I come from a very conservative school background where we didn’t have sex ed.’ Now we’re talking about all these issues so openly and so honestly and providing information and being positive about it.”
Ultimately, Peña said Sex Week is about liberating students’ minds and giving them an opportunity to learn and ask questions freely without feeling any shame.
“Let’s get rid of the stigma surrounding everything about sex,” Peña said. “That’s the only way everyone can have really healthy and successful sex lives, whether that includes having sex or not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a move that could further complicate the future of Harvard’s social group policy, faculty are scheduled to vote on a motion opposing the sanctions this Tuesday—more than a year after the policy first ignited boisterous faculty debate.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 introduced the motion at the October Faculty meeting; it it states that Harvard College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.”
 It remains unclear what effect the Lewis motion would have on College’s stance towards final clubs, sororities, and fraternities if it passes. In an interview last month, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that the best-case scenario is to have Faculty and administrators reach widespread agreement.
“The best outcome for us is to have the Faculty, administration, President, Corporation all agree that this is right for us,” he said. “If we’re not there, we don’t have a solution.”
This motion comes in response to a May 2016 policy that, starting with the class of 2021, forbids members of final clubs and Greek organizations from holding club leadership positions or athletic team captaincies, or being recommended for certain postgraduate fellowships.
This policy, however, is subject to change: University President Drew G. Faust will choose from one of three options outlined in a report from a committee convened to reevaluate the policy. She said in an interview on Friday that she will make her decision before the end of her tenure as president in June.
Because of unusually large anticipated attendance due to the vote, the meeting will be held in Science Center C instead of University Hall. There is a chance, however, that the meeting will conclude before Faculty have a chance to vote: Last year, Faust wrapped up the December Faculty meeting before a vote on a similar Lewis motion could take place.
Government professor Danielle S. Allen’s social policy motion, which received unanimous support from the Faculty Council in September, would also have been eligible for a Faculty vote this November. However, Allen withdrew her motion last month, writing that her motion was “too technical” and “too subtle.”
Allen wrote that she would instead be supporting East Asian Languages and Civilizations Professor David L. Howell’s motion, which will be introduced at the meeting. The motion moves that the Faculty recognize that basic rights and freedoms may come into conflict with each other at Harvard, and in these cases “it is the responsibility of the faculty and administration of Harvard College to establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.”
The Faculty will also discuss a proposal to move Faculty meeting times up to 3:00 pm instead of the traditional 4:00 p.m. and extend the length of Faculty meetings to two hours rather than an hour and a half.
They will also begin debate over a proposal from Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris, to restructure how Harvard College students cross-register with peer institutions like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Under Harris’s proposal, students will only be allowed to receive a maximum of eight credits through cross registration.
Finally, Allen will also present the preliminary recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion.

University President Drew G. Faust called a Republican proposal to tax large university endowments a “blow at the strength of American higher education” in an interview Friday, vowing to oppose many of the measures in the tax overhaul bill before Congress.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, unveiled by Republican lawmakers Nov. 2, includes a provision that would set an excise tax of 1.4 percent on the investment income of private colleges and universities that have at least 500 students and assets totaling $100,000 or more per full-time student. If the tax was in place for fiscal year 2017, Faust estimates Harvard would have handed over nearly $43 million to the federal government—funds she say would otherwise be spent funding Harvard’s research efforts or bolstering financial aid.
“It seems to us a blow at the strength of American higher education, the excellence of American higher education, and the competitiveness of American higher education,” Faust said. “At a time when, around the world there’s an investment in higher education, why would you put a tax on it?”
Last Thursday’s proposal marks a renewed effort by legislators to tap large university endowments for federal funds. In 2016, several senators began to consider whether universities boasting endowments with values of $1 billion or more should be taxed. Faust fiercely fought the proposal at the time, and it remains one of the University’s top lobbying priorities.
Faust said Thursday’s announcement was particularly “dispiriting” in light of past lobbying efforts, which included penning a letter to lawmakers explaining the purpose of Harvard’s endowment and repeated trips to the Capitol.
“I was on the Hill a lot last winter and was assured by a number of members of Congress that they were not considering an endowment tax, that they did not think it was a good idea,” Faust said. “And now those same people seem to be supporting it.”
Aside from requiring Harvard to hand over money each year, the tax might discourage potential donors from giving their money to the University. If the government taxes the endowment, Faust said donors might instead elect to fund other charitable organizations that will remain tax-exempt, like hospitals or scientific research foundations.
Several other measures in the wide-ranging tax bill, one of Republican lawmakers’ primary legislative priorities, could make higher education more expensive for some students and further threaten Harvard’s ability to attract donations.
The Tax Cut and Jobs Act restructures how individuals can claim tax deductions, potentially disincentivizing charitable giving to institutions like Harvard.
Three other provisions in the tax proposal directly impact how students pay tuition. The bill treats graduate student tuition waivers as taxable income and eliminates the tax deduction for interest on student loans. The bill also targets subsidies meant for employees who want to take classes through their employers.
Faust said the proposed changes lack “policy logic,” adding that she is actively lobbying lawmakers to oppose them.
“We have been working assiduously to make our case with people in Congress and use alumni who have connections with members of Congress to express their views, and to try to make clear why this would be such a destructive set of measures,” Faust said.
The tax plan is one of several federal policy changes that Harvard has actively fought in the last year. In particular, Faust has made a series of statements opposing changes in immigration policy, reductions to federal research funding, and the introduction of a ban on transgender service members in the military.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to allocate $1,000 from its First-Year Class Committee budget to provide “Gender 101” training sessions in freshmen entryways.
The sessions, which will be led by the the Harvard College Women’s Center, will focus on “establishing   shared knowledge and language around” gender-related topics, according to the legislation. The UC plans to pilot the program in the spring in as many as 15 freshman entryways.
Entryway proctors must first opt-in to the trainings, which would take place during study breaks. The program will give proctors $4 per student to spend on food for these events. After the meetings, the UC will collect feedback from students alongside the Harvard College Women’s Center and the Freshman Dean’s Office.
“This is giving people a common set of language they can use to discuss often unknown issues,” Crimson Yard representative Sonya Kalara ’21, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said.
Leverett House representative Salma Abdelrahman ’20 said she hopes the program will continue into the next academic year and become mandatory for all freshmen entryways in the future.
“If we get really good feedback, this would be used potentially to advocate for the Women’s Center to get more interns,” Abdelrahman said.
All but one representative voted in favor of the legislation.
During the UC’s meeting, the Council also voted to develop a “Plan for Inclusive Excellence” in an effort to promote diversity and inclusion within the student government.
The move comes after the release of the Presidential Task Force for Inclusion and Belonging’s draft report. Abdelrahman said she has spoken with Task Force co-chair Danielle S. Allen about holding the UC accountable to advance the goals laid out in the report.
One member from each UC caucus will join a new “Caucus Advisory Board” to create a guiding document concerning diversity and inclusion for Council committee chairs to utilize.
Abdelrahman explained that the board will identify “long term goals and actual steps to achieve those goals.”
Utilizing its new “burst pack,” the UC also partially funded a new app to help students place orders at the House Grilles—student-run late-night dining options on campus. Although some representatives, including Rules Committee Chair Evan M.

UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 and Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 also said they met with University President Drew G. Faust on Friday. Sachee said the duo discussed Faust’s advocacy work in Washington D.C. and updated Faust on the Council’s efforts. Sachee said Faust was “impressed” with the UC-backed event during Freshman Family Weekend for students without family on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust may wait until December or later to make a final decision on the future of the College’s social group policy, biding her time until Faculty vote on two motions about undergraduate social life.
For months, faculty and administrators have clashed over who has the power to impose penalties on members of single-gender social organizations. That debate will again come to a head at a Faculty meeting Tuesday, where professors are expected to discuss the two motions.
Meanwhile, Faust is considering set of recommendations from a committee composed of faculty, students, and staff that reviewed the original policy: maintain current penalties for members of single-gender social organizations, ban membership in unrecognized groups outright, or consider “some other possible solutions.” Before she selects any of these options, though, she will wait for the Faculty debates to pan out—which may not occur until December or later.
“These meetings have been so unpredictable and have gone in sometimes unpredictable directions and I’d like to wait to see how it unfolds,” she said.
“I would say the timeline is before I stop being president, you’ll be hearing from me on this issue,” she added about when she expects to choose on of the options laid out in the report. She will step down from the presidency in June 2018.
Faust said she would “consider what’s workable, what kind of policy requires what kind of overhead or structure, what policy is going to cause legal problems, what policy is going to enable people to sneak around it.”
Of the two motions before the Faculty Tuesday, professors will likely vote on the first, which former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 filed in order to nullify the College’s policy. The Faculty will also discuss a second, proposed by East Asian Languages and Civilizations Professor David L. Howell, that would “establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.” It could be more than a month, however, before the Faculty votes on that motion.
On top of the Faculty motions, Faust may again need to turn to the Faculty to finalize Harvard’s social group policy. Dean of the Faculty Michael D. Smith said that the Faculty will need to approve any “major changes” to the policy through its Student Handbook review process. Faust said she said she was not familiar with that process.
"It’s not clear to me what needs to go in the Handbook and what doesn’t, so I think it would depend on what the policy was, whether it would need to go in the Handbook,” she said. "I’d have to consult with the keepers of the Handbook. I don’t know the legalistic dimensions of it."
Faust also defended the decision not to have Faculty approve the original policy through the Handbook review process.
"Our sense from the outset was that this wasn’t a disciplinary procedure—this was a kind of distribution of University resources and didn’t need to be in the Handbook," she said.
Handbook question aside, Faust maintained Friday that she and the Corporation have ultimate power over the future of undergraduate social life.
“I will, in all of this, be consulting with the Corporation, which has the policy responsibility for the University,” she said. "I am a member of the Corporation, but the Corporation as a whole could, I think, come out anywhere on that range of options."
Faust also said that the body would ensure that the resulting policy sees the light of day under her successor.
"The outcome of the decision will be with the Corporation,” she said. “The Corporation is the continuing presence of governance at Harvard, and that will make for continuity."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly a dozen experts on American nuclear policy said United States laws regulating the use of weapons of mass destruction likely increase the chances of nuclear war during a day-long conference held in Harvard’s Science Center Saturday.
United States Senator Edward J. Markey—one of many speakers, which included a former secretary of defense, a congressman from Massachusetts, and professors from elite universities across the country—expressed support for nuclear restraint and disarmament.
“The risk of inadvertent nuclear war has risen to a level that is simply unacceptable,” Markey said.
English professor Elaine Scarry—who served as one of the co-chairs of the conference, titled “Presidential First Use of Nuclear Weapons: Is it Legal? Is it Constitutional? Is it Just?”—said one of the goals of the conference was to spark a conversation about the legality of nuclear weapon use by the United States government.
“There is a deep and important question about the legality of the country’s presidential first use policy, which has essentially been in effect for 70 years,” she said, referring to a policy that gives the president the power to unilaterally decide to use nuclear weapons.
Many of the speakers said this policy of presidential first use makes the United States more likely to become embroiled in a nuclear war.
“If adversaries believe that we may go nuclear, we create the very pressure that encourages them to build nuclear arsenals and keep them on high alert,” Markey said.
In the first panel of the morning, Sissela Bok, a visiting fellow at Harvard’s Center for Population and Development Studies, urged attendees to think about the consequences of nuclear war.
“People all over the world are at the mercy, in a way, of what would happen if a nuclear war broke out and so it’s in their self interest to pay attention,” she said afterward.
Over the course of the afternoon, other speakers discussed whether or not the United States Constitution should prevent the president from unilaterally launching nuclear weapons—and whether the strength of the nation’s armed forces renders the use of nuclear weapons unnecessary.
Mass. Congressman James P. McGovern said he believes the United States does not need to use nuclear weapons.
“We are not weak. We are not vulnerable. We have many options to take the initiative and strike first for retaliation,” McGovern said. “Nuclear retaliation, let alone ‘first strike,’ is not needed.”
Reflecting on the day, Scarry said she thought the invited speakers were all of “uniformly high quality.”
Some attendees, though, said they wished more undergraduates had come to the conference.
James Song ’20, an attendee, said he believes it is important that young people continue to pay attention to the issue of nuclear proliferation.
“Awareness motivates actions,” Song said. “It is important to continue to be sensitive to the question, to the issue, to participate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A case of mistaken identity, coupled with tight play-calling, may have helped to put an end to Harvard men’s soccer’s Ivy League hopes.
The Crimson (2-9-4, 1-3-2 Ivy) fell to Ivy League champions Dartmouth (11-3-1, 5-0-1 Ivy) on a wonder-goal that came in the final minute of the game, after senior midfielder Matt Danilack’s  bicycle kick found the back of the net.
The Crimson was forced to play the majority of the game with only 10 men, after freshman midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso was ejected for receiving his second yellow card of the evening. The Delray Beach, Fla., native had previously picked up his penalty for pulling down a Dartmouth player with 25 ticks on the clock, just shortly after coming onto the field. There weren’t many complaints to be had from the Harvard players, as it was a clear pull, and it took place within a few yards of the referee.
Just under 10 minutes later though, the Crimson players, coaching staff, and fans were left puzzled as Belloni-Urso was issued a second yellow card for a late, but tame, challenge on a Dartmouth player around midfield. The referee quickly showed a yellow to the rookie, but hesitated for a very long time before pulling out the red card to send him off the field.
The unusual delay was a fairly obvious indication that the referee did not initially realize that it was Belloni-Urso who made the challenge, which means that the referee could have thought that he was issuing a first yellow card to him. This makes sense, as the second offense may have been worthy of a first yellow card, (even this is debatable) but it was by no means a challenge worth sending him off for. Thus, without meaning to, the referee had sentenced Harvard to playing the game, with a whole hour remaining on the clock, with one less player than its opponent.
Although the Crimson battled well to the end, the man-advantage proved to be too much for it to handle. Harvard spent most of the rest of the game defending, but the contest was not an outrageously one-sided affair. The Crimson definitely had its chances going forward. One can only wonder how the game would have turned out if Harvard had been able to play 11 strong.
The loss on October 28th was enough to eliminate Harvard from Ivy League contention this year. With two games remaining on the schedule, a win would have put the Crimson two points off the top spot, while a tie would have left it four back. In either scenario, the team would have had a lot to play for heading into its last two contests, but as it stands, the Crimson will have to wait until next year for a shot at Ancient Eight glory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an unorthodox weekend, the Harvard sailing team braved variable conditions and new race styles, culminating in mixed results.
The Crimson hosted the Horn Trophy Team Race on the Charles River, competed in the Sister Esther Open on Narragansett Bay, and traveled to Connecticut for the Hap Moore Team Race on the Thames River.
This weekend saw the beginning of the team racing season, requiring significant adjustment for Harvard sailors. In the Horn Trophy Team Race on the familiar Charles, the Crimson finished third in a four-team field, with its only wins coming in a sweep over MIT.
“Team racing is a really different format from fleet, in the length and how they’re conducted,” junior Andrew Puopolo said.
The conditions, unlike the style of the regatta, were familiar for Harvard. The light wind throughout the weekend was typical for the Charles.
“The team was working very well in unison for the beginning of the team racing season,” freshman Emily Malpass said. “We were pleasantly surprised.”
Adjusting to the new style, the Crimson won two races and lost three.
“It was better than we expected coming in,” Puopolo said.
In addition to the Horn Trophy Team Race, the Hap Moore Trophy Team Race also offered a new challenge with the team format. Harvard yet again experienced ups and downs in this regatta, finishing with five wins and six losses. The Crimson ended up fifth in a field of eight teams.
“Conditions were really rough,” freshman Henry Burnes said. “There was lots of current and the wind was pretty squirrelly.”
Last season, Harvard found more success on the banks of the River Thames. The Crimson recorded an even 9-9 record, good for third place out of seven schools. This year, the unpredictability of the conditions proved challenging, especially in the first weekend of team racing.
“On the upwind leg, we would have the current whipping downwind,” Wang said. “And on the downwind leg we would have current whipping in the opposite way.”
In addition to rough conditions, Harvard struggled with its starts in the races.
“It was a tough weekend, but I think it was a good awakening to have things that we need to work on, like starting.” Burnes said. “And we’ll come back in the spring and focus on improving those things moving forward.”
Despite the tough weather and mixed results, the weekend proved to be a learning experience for the Crimson to prepare for the upcoming team season in the spring.
“This was a good first team race regatta,” Wang said. “We learned a lot to apply to our future team regattas in the spring.”
Working together was important with the constant changing of combinations.
“We were rotating through four combinations in three boats,” Burnes said. “It was the first team race so we were rusty… but it was good that everyone got to sail, and we definitely got to learn a lot.”
At the Sister Esther Open—hosted by Salve Regina University on the Narragansett Bay—Harvard excelled in the familiar fleet racing style. The Crimson finished third in a field of twenty, behind only the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and Roger Williams University, respectively.
The successful racing at the Sister Esther Open balanced out the irregular weekend of team racing.
“We wanted to do better, but it was a good learning experience,” Burnes said.
Harvard was victorious in the event last year, finishing 37 points ahead of second-place Tufts.
The conditions in Newport, R.I. this time around offered a good weekend for racing, with a beautiful Saturday and breezy Sunday.
As the spring approaches, the first weekend of team racing is valuable in determining weaknesses to focus on before team racing heats up.
“It was a good opportunity to get our feet wet and get ready for team racing in the spring,” Puopolo said.
This was the second-to-last weekend of the fall season for the Crimson, which will travel to SUNY Maritime College in New York for the Atlantic Coast Championship next weekend in its final regatta of the fall season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into its final game of the regular season, No. 16 Harvard field hockey knew that it had a chance to rewrite the record books. In last week’s win against Dartmouth, the Crimson tied the program record with its 12th win of the year. Thanks to a standout performance by freshman forward Mimi Tarrant, Harvard (13-4, 6-1 Ivy League) beat Columbia (9-8, 4-3 Ivy), 4-0, in New York, N.Y. to pick up a 13th victory and set a new mark for single-season wins.
After beginning the game with a barrage of shots, Harvard scored the opening goal in the sixth minute. Freshman forward Natalie Sicher played a pass to Tarrant, whose shot from close range beat the goalkeeper to open the scoring.
Following the goal, the Crimson kept up its attack, peppering Columbia junior goalkeeper Katie Dempsey with shots. Harvard outshot the Lions, 9-0, and took six penalty corners in the opening half. However, despite its offensive efforts, the Crimson was unable to net another goal before halftime.
On the other end of the field, Harvard was similarly dominant on defense in the first stanza, stifling the Lions offense and preventing Columbia from getting a single shot off on net. As a result, the teams went into the break with Harvard leading, 1-0.
The second period opened in much the same way as the first, with the Crimson firing off seven shots in the first 10 minutes of play. While Columbia managed its first shot of the contest in the 38th minute, Harvard’s defense clamped down shortly thereafter. That shot would remain the Lions’ only attempt on goal of the matchup.
Harvard managed to double its lead in the 54th minute. Freshman back Hannah Pearce took a penalty corner but saw her effort on net saved by Dempsey. Sophomore forward Maddie Earle collected the redirected shot and fired off her own attempt, which was blocked. Earle stuck with the play, however, recovering her blocked shot and rifling home a second effort for the score.
“It stayed at 1-0 for a long time because they did a great job keeping the ball out of the cage,” said sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen. “We just needed that extra boost to get the second goal. After that, we really had the drive to score more goals.”
Harvard wouldn’t have to wait as long for its next tally. In the 56th minute, Tarrant took the ball and made a run down the right side of the field. She found van Vlijmen with a pass to the center of the field, and the sophomore’s shot hit the back of the net for the goal.
Not content with a 3-0 lead, the Crimson pressed on with its attack. In the 61st minute, Tarrant found her way onto the scoresheet again, as she converted off of a pass from freshman midfielder Tessel Huibregsten. The goal is Tarrant’s 12th of the season, making her the team’s leading scorer.
Following the goal, Harvard fired off several more shots, but the team was not able to add to its tally, and the game ultimately ended as a 4-0 victory. The win sees the Crimson break the mark set by last year’s team for victories in a single season.
“It’s proved that we’re heading in the right direction with the program overall,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “Moreso, its a testament to the work that our athletes are putting in every day. It’s nice to get a couple confirmations that we’re doing the right things.”
Following today’s result, Harvard will turn to the bigger picture—the NCAA Division I playoffs. The team will be tuning in at 10 pm on Sunday night, as the selection announcements for this year’s tournament will be broadcast. The Crimson hopes that it can build off of its momentum from the regular season as the playoffs pick up.
“We definitely have a chance to make it,” van Vlijmen said. “All we want to do is play more games with our team. We want to prove that we have become better, and we want to get the chance to compete. We’re not done yet, and we showed that today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard enough to complete a sprint with a parachute attached to your back. Imagine having to run around with it for 90 minutes.
That’s what the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-9-4, 1-3-2 Ivy League) faced Sunday afternoon in New York, N.Y. after Columbia senior forward Arthur Bosua scored twice in the first five minutes of the game as part of a dazzling four-goal performance that left the Crimson stunned and without a response.
“We just didn’t show up to compete today,” said co-captain and defender Justin Crichlow. “It’s kind of as simple as that. We weren’t marking well enough on crosses. We didn’t mark up on set pieces and that was the main thing we knew we had to focus on. They are a very big team, and we just didn’t perform well tonight. We didn’t execute on our game points.”
The No. 25 Lions (10-2-3, 4-1-1) did not look back as they tacked on four more goals in a convincing 6-0 victory that puts the team in position to scavenge a share of the Ivy League title for the second straight year if Dartmouth loses next weekend.
On homecoming weekend, Bosua left nothing on the table with a career-high four goals, racing out with a strike just 1:21 into the game. A goal less than three minutes later left the South African with a chance to record the fastest hat trick ever in NCAA Division 1 history. Instead, he had to settle for besting his own scoring pace, completing his hat trick just 1:15 into the second half.
“Columbia were efficient,” freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik said. “They had some chances, and they scored on the chances they got.”
While Columbia was chasing history, Harvard unsuccessfully chased offensive success. Despite a short streak in the first half where the team managed to string together passes, nothing came to fruition. After recording 21 shots against both Brown and Princeton, the Crimson recorded just two efforts for second game in a row, with none on goal. Hindered by its lack of attacking success, the team is now winless in seven-straight games, the longest such streak since 2012.
Although the Crimson has historically been a perennial title contender, this year’s Ivy League season brought countless frustrations. After a slow non-conference start, Harvard looked to have snapped out of its early season woes with a thrilling comeback win at Yale. But the breakout never occurred.
It might look like Sunday’s result was the Crimson’s long-awaited collapse after a difficult season. The 6-0 shellacking was the team’s worst result since a 2012 loss against then-No. 3/4 Connecticut. Some of the result may have to do with the more open lineup that coach Pieter Lehrer sent out.
Freshman goalkeeper Matt Freese started his second game of the season, and nine substitutes came on in relief. The team is now looking toward the future with seven seniors graduating and depth players looking to fill larger roles. Along the way, there will likely be growing pains, as evidenced by Sunday’s game. But the blows are taken better when they come in relatively meaningless games. The goal is to make a 6-0 loss more productive than a 1-0 loss, although it may not feel that way.
The team has already shown the potency of its youth. Sophomore forward Philip Hausen leads the team with nine points on three goals and three assists. Seven of the nine Crimson players who have recorded points this season are underclassmen. There is certainly great potential going forward.
“I hope that somebody will step up in terms of being a leader, on and off the field,” Crichlow said. “You know, with [co-captain Eric] Gylling and I leaving, somebody is definitely going to need to do that and I hope people will be inspired by me in terms of working hard on the field and pouring everything into the team off the field.”
Large losses often lead to lots of reflection, regret, and disappointment. The five-hour bus ride back from New York City certainly facilitated that process. The only real result from the Columbia contest is a loss in pride. The team can get that back next Saturday in its season finale against Penn.
The seniors will get one last chance to defend their home ground, and the returning members will be playing for the graduating players.
“Obviously, this will be the last time some of the guys on the team play with us, so it can be emotional,” Bencsik said. “I think all the guys are ready to give everything they have…and go out with some pride.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

­The penultimate weekend of play for the Harvard women’s volleyball team was marked by both excitement and disappointment as the Crimson found itself on both ends of upsets.
On the road for the third consecutive weekend, Harvard (12-9, 7-5 Ivy League) pulled off a surprise victory against conference-leading Yale on Friday, but fell to last-place Brown in five sets on Saturday night.
“It was the highest of highs and and the lowest of lows this week,” senior hitter Paige Kebe said. “Overall, we are not feeling great this weekend, but it was great to beat Yale on their home court, but unfortunately that was negated by our loss to Brown. I don’t think we took the Brown game as seriously as we should have.”
The Crimson now has the slimmest of chances to earn a share of the Ivy League title this weekend, as it must beat Princeton and Penn while relying on a slew of favorable results from its other foes in the Ancient Eight. The conference title will most likely fall into the hands of either the Bulldogs and Princeton, who both currently own a 9-3 record in conference play.
BROWN 3, HARVARD 2
Despite dominant play in the first and third frames, Harvard failed to close out the weekend sweep, falling to the Bears (7-16, 2-10 Ivy), 13-15, in the tiebreaker round in Providence, R.I.
Sophomore hitter Grace Roberts Burbank carried Harvard offensively, executing 22 kills and leading the team in hitting percentage at .375. The San Francisco, Calif. native is currently second on the team in kills for the season, having amassed 204 in total.
Roberts Burbank was matched on the opposite side of the court by Brown freshman hitter Gabrielle Moriconi, who delivered a team-high 18 kills.
The Bears rookie hitter was held in the second and fourth sets, but her team still came away with a victory in each frame thanks to gritty defensive play and a number of execution mistakes by the Crimson.
In the second set, Brown notched 40 attempts on offense but was only successful on eight of those hits. The fourth stanza saw the Bears finish with just a 6.8 attacking percentage mark.
Nevertheless, Harvard had similar struggles on offense in both of those sets. In its 20-25 defeat in the second period, the Crimson committed a game-high nine errors and landed just ten kills on 41 total attempts. The fourth set started off more favorably for Harvard, but the team sustained a defensive breakdown after amassing a 23-21 lead, as the Bears to clawed their way back with four consecutive points to win the frame.
With the game pushed to a 15-point tiebreaker set, offensive leaders Roberts Burbank and Moriconi each put crucial points on the board. However, despite landing five set kills compared to Moriconi’s four, Roberts Burbank was unable to rally Harvard to victory, as the team fell, 13-15, in the tie-breaking period.
The win was just Brown’s second against an Ivy opponent this season,and marks only the third victory for the Bears this season at the Pizzitola Sports Center.
“We definitely did not bring that same mentality from the Yale game,” junior hitter Jocelyn Meyer said, “We dipped down to a level that we haven’t been playing at this season, and we weren’t able to bring that same fire, consistency, and aggressive fearlessness.”
HARVARD 3, YALE 2
In what will be remembered as a season highlight for the young Crimson team, Friday night’s victory against Yale marked a moment of redemption for a Harvard squad that had been soundly defeated by the Bulldogs in the programs’ last matchup on October 14.
In that game, Yale (15-6, 9-3 Ivy) easily handled the Crimson, 3-1, to retain the top position in the league. In Friday night’s contest, the Bulldogs still hung on to their position on top of the Ivy League leaderboard despite the defeat but were humbled by a hungry Harvard team.
In front of an impressive crowd of over 1,200 fans at the Lee Amphitheater, the Crimson’s lead players delivered in a balanced attack. Kebe, Meyer, and Roberts Burbank each had double-digit kill marks. Additionally, five players tallied more than 11 digs each in the contest—sophomore setter Erin McCarthy led the team in that category with 20 digs.
“We definitely had our strongest mental game of the season,” Meyer said. “They had a very large home crowd and it was their last home weekend, so we definitely had that pressure of playing against a large crowd. We took hold of that and created our own momentum.”
All five sets, including the tiebreaker, were decided by four points or fewer. Harvard jumped out to an early advantage with a 25-21 first set victory, establishing a quick 8-2 lead and never letting go. Kebe stepped up to replace regular starter Mindie Mabry and capped off a strong first period performance with a kill to finish off the set.
The second and third stanzas were again hard-fought, evenly-matched frames, but a combined 30 kills were enough for Yale to come away with 25-21 victories in both sets.
The game’s thrilling peak, however, came in the final two periods. Both sets could have gone either way, with each frame decided in extra points. The Crimson held its ground with a 26-24 victory in the fourth set and finished the game in resounding fashion after it extended a typical 15-point tiebreaker to 20 points, winning 20-18 to seal the upset.

­Come Saturday night’s close on Rocco B. Commisso Stadium in New York, N.Y., two things could be said:
Have a career game, Danielle Etzel. Have a career, Marie Becker, Caroline Chagares, Candy Janachowski, and Dani Stollar.
Led by junior goalkeeper Etzel’s stellar career performance between the pipes, the Harvard women’s soccer team (8-8-1, 2-4-1 Ivy League) closed out its season with a 0-0 double-overtime draw against Ivy League runner-up Columbia (9-5-2, 5-1-1).
Etzel was the wall that the Lions couldn’t get past.
Making a career-high 16 saves in 110 minutes, the Madison, Conn. native followed up her 13-stop performance last weekend with one of the finest shutout performances by a goalkeeper in the country this year. Etzel’s 16 saves were fifth-most by any netminder this season and tops in the Ivy League.
“She’s been purely awesome, she’s such a rock in goal,” Becker said. “Personally, as a center-back, I’m really sad I don’t get to play in front of her [any more], because right now she’s giving us a sense of security—that’s what you want from your goalkeeper.”
The entire Crimson defense had to batten down the hatches, too—Harvard resolutely withstood a barrage of 39 shots during the game, including 17 efforts in the first half. Etzel saved five shots on goal in overtime alone. With Columbia’s attacking unit firing on all cylinders, the Crimson also withstood nine total corner kicks.
“Our team was low on numbers…we had three subs and not all of them were healthy,” Becker said. “It was a grind and we knew it was going to be a grind, and I’m so, so, so proud of how the team did what the coaches asked: fight until the end and give it all you have.”
If there’s one game that’s a testament to the graduating class’s grit, it must be this one. The defensive struggle against one of the Ivy’s best programs closed out careers for Harvard’s class of 2018, a group of defensive stalwarts who have combined for 29 shutouts and 37 wins since the start of the 2014 season.
After Becker, Janachowski, and Stollar saw varying amounts of playing time as freshmen, Chagares joined their ranks as a sophomore during the 2015-16 season, and the four players have become a staple of the Crimson’s resilient midfield-backline ever since.
“All of them have really contributed immensely to the success of the program,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “Marie and Candy have turned into high-level players…Dani came in [and won] Rookie of the Year…Caroline was injured for many parts of her career but [she was] a leader and a captain on and off the field.”
Put this alongside stellar goalkeeping performances like Etzel’s on Saturday, and one can understand how Saturday night’s game was a microcosm of the resolute defense that Harvard has played for years under the direction of the class of 2018.
“We’ve really been blessed to have those four on our program,” Hamblin said.
Off the field, too, the four seniors helped build a warm team culture that lifted the team’s spirits in both good and bad times. The Crimson didn’t win a championship in 2017, but the seniors will leave the squad in good position for the coming years, regardless.
“I’ve never seen a team so welcoming, so open,” Becker said. “There’s just support and love for each other…one of the greatest achievements of our class was just establishing a team culture of really being a family.”
On the offensive side of the pitch on Saturday, freshman forward Murphy Agnew, junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi, and Stollar took two shots apiece, totaling six for the game for the visitors. Those three players finished with the most points for Harvard in 2017-18.
Blossoming midway through the season, Agnew, who amassed four goals and five assists, led the team in season points. Her accomplishment marked the first time a rookie has been the program’s top points-getter since Midge Purce ’17 led the team in 2013-14. Mohammadi also chipped in a team-high 60 shots on the season, and her four goals and four assists were good for a new career-high in points.
The incoming class also stepped up in a few spots this year—freshman defender/midfielder Linda Liedel recorded two goals on the year, one against then-No.17 Princeton, and fellow rookie defender Maria DiMartinis contributed three assists, playing in all but one of the Crimson’s games this season.
Saturday’s outcome extended a streak of good results for Harvard against Columbia, as it now holds a 9-0-1 record against the Lions in the last ten games and a 27-3-2 all-time lead. In addition, last year’s title-clinching 2-1 victory also came against Columbia.
This year, the visiting Crimson
successfully played the role of spoiler at the Lions’ expense. In order to tie for the Ivy League title, Columbia had needed to win to keep pace with Princeton, who had beaten Penn earlier in the day, 1-0, but the tie meant the Lions went home two points shy of the throne.
“We weren’t playing for the title, but we played like we were,” Hamblin said. “I was so proud of how the team stepped up against a team that was playing for everything.”
In their quest for a title, Columbia senior defender/forward Natalie Neshat fired off 10 shots on Saturday and junior netminder Sophie Whitehouse posted her sixth Ivy League shutout, but it wasn’t to be. Sensationally, Whitehouse and the Columbia defense only gave up one goal in all of conference play.
Despite these efforts, and despite upsetting Princeton on October 14, Columbia will have to watch as the Tigers dance into the NCAA tournament.
In a season that saw Harvard undergo some tough times on the pitch, including a 1-5 stretch at the start of Ivy play, ending the season with a hard-fought victory over Dartmouth and tie against a team vying for the title certainly have the Crimson looking up. Had Columbia won today’s matchup, they would have tied for the Ancient Eight crown with the Princeton Tigers.
“This was a tough year, for many reasons in regards to some of the challenges we faced, the injuries we had, and some of the losses we took,” Hamblin said. “We’re really proud we could do that [for our seniors]. [Our seniors] are incredible women and we’re going to miss them.”
As for the future of Harvard women’s soccer, the underclassmen already have the outgoing class’s vote of confidence.
“I’m more than positive that they’re going to take the Ivy League apart,” Becker said. “They’ve already shown their potential this year, and all the incredible freshmen growing into their roles and getting adjusted to college soccer, I’m so excited for.”
With an overall record of .500, Saturday’s tie also secured the Crimson its 11th-straight season with a record of .500 or better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

This weekend, the Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to Williamsburg, Va., for its final matchup of the fall season. Facing off against six other teams in William & Mary’s Tribe Invitational, the Crimson squad had a strong showing in both singles and doubles.
“Overall William & Mary was our strongest showing of the fall, which is very encouraging for the spring season. It was a lot of fun to travel with the whole team and it was clear how much everyone has improved throughout the fall,” co-captain Jean Thirouin said.
Overall, the team went 15-8 in singles and 5-3 in doubles. Freshmen Robert Wrzesinski and Constantin Zoske, sophomores Galen Lee and Logan Weber, juniors Andrew Ball, Michael Peters, and Andy Zhou, and seniors Grant Solomon and Thirouin competed in this weekend’s matchups. The team faced off against the Tribe, Middle Tennessee State, Penn State, Old Dominion, VCU, and Richmond.
“The team did a great job this weekend—I felt like everyone really locked into their games,” Zhou said. “It’s exciting to see because usually it takes longer for people to find their rhythm in the fall; in the past I’ve felt like even at this stage in the fall people are still trying to find their groove. Good play this weekend translated into quite a few wins across the board, which is great for confidence but also justification for the work we’ve put in this fall.”
Ball and Solomon went undefeated this weekend, 3-0. Ball remains unblemished this season with a 6-0 record. The freshman doubles duo of Wrzesinski and Zoske went unbeaten this weekend as well.
DAY THREE
The Crimson dominated day one and day two of the tournament, entering day three with a 13-3 record in singles and finishing day two undefeated in doubles. On Sunday, the team faced opponents from the Blue Raiders and the Nittany Lions.
“I would say the team’s biggest strength is how connected we are to each other,” Zhou said. “Everyone has really bought into the mantras that we’ve discussed not only with our coaches but also amongst ourselves, and when everyone commits to the same philosophy and team culture it’s a really powerful effect that has tangible impact on all our games. I think that’s translated into a lot of improvement from every standpoint for all our guys.”
On the singles side, Harvard won three of its eight matches, with victories coming from Solomon, Zoske, and Peters. Zoske bested his MTSU opponent in straight sets, while Solomon and Peters both fought it out against Penn State players, coming out on top in two three-set nailbiters.
Zhou and Thirouin fell to their Blue Raiders opponents in straight sets, as did Lee to his Nittany Lion opponent. Wrzesinski had a close contest against a Penn State player: after losing the first set 6-3, the Lithuanian rookie came back in the second set with a 7-5 win, but ended up giving up the third set 6-2. Weber also fell in a three-set matchup, giving up the second two sets after having taken the first set in a tiebreaker.
The Crimson went 2-2 in doubles on Sunday. Wrzesinski and Zoske won their match 6-2, remaining unbeaten this season as doubles partners.
DAY TWO
Harvard swept the singles side, winning six of eight singles matches of the day. Thirouin, Solomon, Wrzesinski, and Lee all claimed straight set victories.
The team has shown great depth this season.
“Our team isn’t big, and if we have one bad egg or one person who doesn’t give it his all every day, it drags everyone else down; I’m definitely very happy that that isn’t the case with the group we have right now,” Zhou said.
The Palo Alto, Calif., native had a tough match against a William & Mary senior Alec Miller. After clinching the first set, Zhou gave up the second frame, but managed to come back in the third, 7-5. Ball also claimed a three-set victory, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4.
Zoske and Peters both fell to the respective Tribe competitors.
On the doubles side, Harvard again claimed victory, with Solomon and Weber edging out their opponents 7-6 in a critical win.
DAY ONE
On Friday, Harvard entered the tournament strong, claiming seven of eight singles matches and three of four doubles matches. Facing off against VCU and Richmond players, Thirouin, Solomon, Ball, Peters, Zoski, Wresinski, and Weber all earned wins for the Crimson, while Zhou fell in a three-set heartbreaker. Three of the wins--Zoske, Wrzesinski, and Weber--came in the form of tough three-set matchups.
On the doubles side, Thirouin and Zhou earned a tiebreaker victory 8-7, while Wrzesinski and Zoske delivered a handy 8-1 victory. Peters and Lee bested their Richmond opponents 8-6, while the only doubles loss of the day came from Weber and Solomon, 8-5.
The team has had a strong fall season, with standout individual performances across the board. Thirouin and Zhou both advanced to the semi-finals of the ITA Regional Championships the previous weekend.
“Obviously I want to see more improvement as we move into the off season before the spring,” Zhou said. “More specifically I think that individually we all have certain technical aspects of our game that could use developing, which is something the coaches have spoken with us about and will definitely be a big priority during these next few weeks before the end of official practices. Keeping up our conditioning will be another challenge that is high up on the list. That’s been a huge help to us so far this season and we definitely need to stay disciplined in that regard.”
The Crimson squad will return to the courts for its regular spring season in January against Southern Methodist University.—Staff writer Jamie Chen can be reached at jamie.chen@thecrimson.com.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a series that began on Sunday and will continue through the Crimson’s season opener on Nov. 10 against MIT, men’s basketball beat writer Stephen Gleason will look at Harvard’s 13 nonconference opponents. Coming in at No. 7 is Northeastern.
No. 13: MIT
No. 12: Holy Cross
No. 11: Fordham
No. 10: Manhattan
No. 9: Massachusetts
No. 8: Wofford
Northeastern
2017-2018 Matchup: Thursday, November 30 at Matthews Arena, Boston, Mass. (7:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 15-16 overall, 8-10 Colonial Athletic Association
2016-2017 Matchup: Harvard, 86, Northeastern, 80
Head Coach: Bill Coen (12th season)
Key Returning Players: senior guard Devon Begley (lone senior on roster, started 21 games a season ago, averaged 9.7 points per game and 3.7 assists); sophomore guard Bolden Brace (6’8” wing, made 56 three-pointers a season ago)
Stat to Watch: 86: the number of points that the Huskies conceded to Harvard a season ago. It was the second-most points that Northeastern gave up last season and was the third-most that the Crimson scored in a game.
Overview: Northeastern is a young team that will be searching for its identity after losing its top two players in T.J. Williams and Alex Murphy. The Huskies’ strength will be in their backcourt, which returns three impact players from a season ago (Devon Begley, Bolden Brace, and Donnell Gresham). Juniors Anthony Green and Jeremy Miller (both 6’10”) will need to take steps forward (most likely as starters) to shore up Bill Coen’s frontcourt.
