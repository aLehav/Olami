After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
COVID-19 has ravaged the bookstore industry. As the city of Cambridge locked down in late March, bookstore owners shuttered storefronts and faced challenging choices with both foot traffic and vital revenue screeching to a halt. Two local bookstores, Harvard Book Store and Raven Used Books, highlight the uncertainties and often crippling realities of two diverging approaches to combating the pandemic's effects.
Alex W. Meriwether is the general manager of Harvard Book Store, an independent book store founded in 1932. In the past, Harvard Book Store hosted more than 300 events every year, including author interviews, book signings, and an in-store weekly Friday Forum. Sometimes, events might have drawn more than a thousand people into an auditorium. Now, however, events have gone virtual, and as Meriwether noted, are “not quite the same” as they used to be.
Harvard Book Store's identity revolves around its reflection of the community. Situated across Massachusetts Avenue from Harvard University's Lamont Library, Harvard Book Store's community comprises academics, locals, and tourists alike. Supporting this community, the store offers a signature service, fittingly named Paige M. Gutenborg: a print on-demand machine, which allows scholars to obtain titles that are out-of-print, writers to self-publish, or anyone to print literature in the public domain.
Even though Harvard Book Store reopened in July and runs according to public health safety guidelines, much of the store's operations have transitioned online. As Meriwether says, the managing team is paying a “strong level of attention to e-commerce.” He acknowledges that the in-person browsing and discovery experience is unparalleled, so the website design has evolved to more closely resemble a bookshelf.
“It [the website design] reflects what makes browsing a bookstore, and our bookstore in particular, special,” said Meriwether.
Despite these efforts, “sales and revenue are way down,” he pointed out. He sees this new way of life for the book store to last “possibly for years to come.”
John Petrovato, the owner of Raven Used Books, has shouldered the pandemic by other means. Petrovato first entered the bookstore industry at the age of 26, when he bought and flipped books while employed as a social worker. Through three decades of diligence and business acumen, Petrovato established and sold-off bookstores across New England, including the Portsmouth Book & Bar, which saw visitors like Bernie Sanders and Stephen King.
Today, Petrovato owns Raven Used Books, currently the only used bookstore in Harvard Square. With over 120,000 mostly unique books in storage, 15,000 books on display, and a nearly 1200-book weekly turnover, Raven Used Books is the specialty-or-out-of-print book collector's haven, since it offers scholarly books with discounts as much as 80% off. Every week, the store buys, on average, a professor's entire collection of specialized books. According to Petrovato, even though the prime Harvard Square location stipulates high rent and small floor space, there is no place he'd rather be.
“Before Cambridge, we were in Amherst, where the [professors'] collections that we pick up once a week would be once every three months,” Petrovato said,
“We would not be able to buy the book collections we do here in Cambridge elsewhere [in New England].”
Unlike Harvard Book Store, Petrovato does not intend to transition to e-commerce. Currently, Raven Used Book's “online [business] is not too serious”; rather, it's a way to “make ends meet” since buying books online is “more busy” than the more than 100 hours of work every week Petrovato already spends onerously deep-cleaning and organizing the store. Already, too, in early November foot traffic had almost returned to “normal business” levels. However, the opening hours were more than halved, so total sales have precipitously declined.
Within the last ten years, e-books have seen a massive boon in popularity and sales. However, Petrovato claimed that e-books have had “little impact on the bookstore business.” Indeed, to Salome J. Garnier '22, who concentrates in government and grew up loving books, e-books are “just not the same” as their physical counterparts. She reasons that, especially now that people spend much of their workdays online, e-books “defeat the purpose” since they keep the reader glued to the screen. She also believed the online shopping experience couldn’t compare to a real bookstore. .
“Online [shopping] is good if you know what you're looking for. But it doesn't replace flipping through a book and seeing how it feels. I look for shorter books rather than longer books, and I can't tell how thick a book is online,” said Garnier.
However, Garnier acknowledged the usefulness of online shopping, since she can dodge long lines and most risks of catching the virus by ordering online.
She summarized, “they [online and in-person shopping] are complementary. But nothing compares to seeing the books in person.”
Bookstores are holding out hope for a resurgence of holiday shopping by individuals like Garnier. However, as Petrovato asserts, January and February tend to be the slowest months. In the past, Meriwether notes, Harvard Book Store relied on a big winter warehouse sale; this year the pandemic has made such an event impossible given safety concerns. Regardless of whether the e-commerce pathway overcomes the howling weather, as the winter season approaches, bookstores might find it hard to feel the holiday cheer. Only time is left to tell the fate of the struggling bookstores.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard security guards ratified a temporary, year-long contract with third-party contractor Securitas on Dec. 30, 2020, maintaining healthcare benefits and securing a one-time bonus during the pandemic.
The local branch of the Service Employees International Union, 32BJ, represents approximately 300 Securitas guards and negotiated the contract.
Roxana L. Rivera, vice president of 32BJ, said the agreement is largely an extension of the previous four-year contract with Securitas, which was initially set to expire Nov. 15, 2020. Rivera said the union sought a one-year agreement with Securitas because of the pandemic, hoping that, after a year, “we would be in a better situation all around.”
Harvard contracts with Securitas North America, a division of a multinational Swedish company with 370,000 employees across the world,  to handle most of its security guard operations.
Christopher Connolly, area vice president for Securitas, declined to comment for this article.
Given the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, 32BJ prioritized healthcare and wages for workers in negotiations, Rivera said.
“It secures continued healthcare coverage for the security officers and a bonus in lieu of a wage increase,” Rivera said of the new contract.
Negotiations with Securitas began in the first week of October, according to Rivera. She added that Securitas agreed to extend the previous four-year contract to Dec. 13, 2020 as talks were still on-going.
The union’s bargaining committee and Securitas reached a tentative agreement before the new Dec. 13 deadline, and voting closed on Dec. 30. More than two-thirds of the membership voted, and 96 percent of voting members favored the one-year contract, according to a text message to union members the union provided The Crimson.
According to a summary of contract changes the union provided, the new contract stipulates a $48 increase in Securitas’s contribution to workers’ health insurance, while maintaining health, dental, and vision benefits amid rising healthcare costs and the global health crisis. The agreement also guarantees a one-time bonus of $1,700 for all officers, including those who are not currently working but are still employed by Securitas.
The union originally proposed a wage increase, but accepted Securitas’s counterproposal for a one-time bonus, as the company was facing economic uncertainty and could not guarantee wage concessions, according to Rivera.
The year-long contract also includes modifications and clarifications to internal policies. The agreement streamlines channels of communication between Securitas, guards, and the union; gives guards more flexibility regarding bereavement leave; and offers similar vacant positions to employees removed from posts at the request of Harvard who have not been issued discipline.
Under the previous contract, Harvard could request a “non-disciplinary transfer” of a Securitas guard, removing them from a post, which sometimes left guards without work and pay even while still employed. In an interview with The Crimson in 2019, one guard alleged that Securitas management orchestrated her non-disciplinary transfer as retaliation for requesting time off for a medical condition and that Harvard administrators simply went along with Securitas’ request.
The new agreement with Securitas is a temporary measure, according to Rivera. The union also reached a tentative agreement with Harvard on a similar one-year contract for another group of workers at the University it represents: contracted and directly-employed custodians. Voting on that agreement will end Jan. 8.
As 32BJ gears up for another round of negotiations on longer-term contracts for both sets of employees, Rivera said the union hopes to gain more permanent protections.
“There has to be some acknowledgement of these workers as essential workers, and we’ll have to see when that time comes,” Rivera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Colombe C. Obono Eyono, a senior at Westville Girls’ High School near Durban, South Africa, was scrolling through her Netflix queue at 2 a.m. when she received a Harvard admissions notification.
After a minutes-long scuffle with her spotty internet connection, Obono Eyono opened her application portal to see an acceptance letter awaiting her.
“I wasn’t really expecting anything,” Obono Eyono said. “I just could never envision myself being accepted.”
Obono Eyono joined 746 other students who received early offers of admission to Harvard College on Dec. 17, marking a record-low 7.4 percent acceptance rate among the 10,086 early applicants to the Class of 2025.
Marco E. Joven Domínguez, an admitted student from Sylmar, Calif., said he paced around his room during the 10 minutes leading up to the release of the admission decision.
“I screamed to my mom,” Joven Domínguez said. “And then we hugged and we both cried, and I instantly called all my friends.”
Despite the unconventional circumstances for early admissions this year, Joven Domínguez cited his passion for the things he did in high school and the foundation built by his parents as his reasons for his acceptance.
“Just getting admitted felt like such a big deal for me,” Joven Domínguez said. “Having two parents who only graduated elementary school, it’s super big for me to have gotten into college, especially Harvard University.”
Emily Y. Feng, an admitted student from Bellevue, Wash., was switching between a new round of Among Us and video calls with friends when she received her admissions decision.
“I was just very, very excited after a lot of emotional roller coastering before,” she said. “It was the first time I think I’ve cried of joy in my life.”
“It’s hard to process even now,” she added.
Austin A. Gentle and William “Jack” Gentle, twins from Chattanooga, Tenn., were both admitted to the Class of 2025 and plan to join Harvard’s football team next year.
Austin Gentle called their acceptances to the same school “a dream come true.”
“Going to Harvard has always been a dream of mine,” he said. “Getting to do it with my brother, that was something special.”
Jack Gentle added that he was grateful for the opportunity to be admitted to the College during a time of “much uncertainty.”
“I know that this is kind of a difficult year and there’s so much uncertainty. More people applied early action, and there’s several people who took a gap year,” Jack Gentle said, referring to the 349 students originally in the Class of 2024 who deferred their admission to join the Class of 2025.
Taj S. Gulati, a prospective member of the Class of 2025 from Frederick, Md., added that he was relieved and grateful for his acceptance.
“My mom was a first generation immigrant — I’m the first generation to be born in this country. I’m very, very grateful for all her work,” Gulati said.
“Knowing that it was one of the hardest years to get in just makes me even more thankful, makes me even more appreciative of all the support I’ve had in my life from my family and my friends,” he added.
The College is no longer taking applications for the Class of 2025, and will release decisions in late March. Admitted applicants have until May 1 to accept or decline their spot in the incoming freshman class.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students from across the country pitched in to campaign in Georgia ahead of Tuesday's contentious Senate runoff elections.
Energized by the stakes of the runoff, many of those students — who largely skew Democratic — became involved since November, phone and text banking for candidates and increasing volunteer recruitment.
If challengers T. Jonathan “Jon” Ossoff and Raphael G. Warnock defeat incumbent Senators David A. Perdue Jr. (R-Ga.) and Kelly L. Loeffler (R-Ga.), Democrats will clinch control of the Senate. Polls indicate close contests in both races.
Menat N. Bahnasy ’22, the former president of the Harvard College Democrats, said the club organized multiple phone and text bank sessions for Harvard students to encourage students to get involved even if they are not based in Georgia.
Bahnasy also said she works as a fellow on the Democratic Party's campaigns in the state, handling volunteer recruitment, alongside other Harvard students.
“I actually don’t think any of us are from Georgia,” Bahnasy said. “That speaks a lot to how excited people are and how important this runoff is for a lot of people.”
For other Harvard students, the races hit closer to home.
Amen H. Gashaw ’24, an Atlanta resident who works for the coordinated Democratic campaign, said Georgia residents can keenly feel the effects of efforts to turn out the vote in the state.
“Every single advertisement on every video or every ad break on television is a campaign related one,” Gashaw said. “We’re definitely seeing campaigns really ramp up their programming and their efforts.”
The races are the most expensive in Senate history, according to OpenSecrets.
Jessica M. Moore ’21, a resident of Henry County, Ga. and another volunteer for the Democratic coordinated campaign, questioned the efficacy of the influx of advertisements, though. In her interactions with voters, Moore said most people have made up their minds on whom they will support, and there are few people left to persuade.
Moore also said working for the campaigns has helped her connect with her home in a new way.
“I feel closer to my county now, and I feel like I understand the people in my county a lot more after this experience,” Moore said. “And it’s just interesting to see what people’s values are, the things that they’re worried about.”
Though Gashaw has a clear preference for the election outcome, she is hopeful for the country’s future regardless of Tuesday's results.
“Overall, I do think that while there might be some tension and there certainly is a lot of urgency, I think there’s optimism on both sides,” Gashaw said. “I’m hoping that regardless of the results, we’ll be able to move into this next season and learn to work together.”
