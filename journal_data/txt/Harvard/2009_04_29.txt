After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, many Harvard students lamented—or grew outraged—at the sudden demise of the Undergraduate Council party grants, which were discontinued following a contentious struggle between the UC and the administration that resulted in then-Interim Dean of the College David Pilbeam terminating the Party Fund. Fortunately, the future of Harvard partying may be looking brighter these days due the UC’s recent passage of the Social Grants Act, which is a pilot program that provides funding for social events on campus provided they meet certain requirements.
We recognize that there were many problems with the original Party Fund system but find that the new proposed program makes reasonable compromises on those issues. 
A significant difference from the old Party Fund system is that the new “UC Weekend Fund” will only distribute grants to events held in House common spaces and will not be used to fund parties in private suites. One of the major concerns with party funding was that money from the administration would be indirectly funding underage drinking. Restricting funding to parties in common areas, which are easier to monitor than private suites, makes underage drinking more difficult—and may be the only reason why this proposal has any support from the administration.
The social grant system also addresses concerns that private parties funded under the old system were underpublicized and often ended up being exclusive. This counteracted a main goal of the Party Fund, which was to expand social opportunities for all undergraduates. The nature of the new system should be more inclusive, especially because House common spaces are much more accessible than private suites, and many students would feel more comfortable attending a party in a JCR than showing up at a stranger’s dorm room.
Still, the benefits of funding and encouraging room parties, as in the old system, so long as they are well publicized and not exclusive, should not be underestimated. The UC should at least attempt to expand this program in the future to also fund suite parties. Measures could be taken to monitor alcohol consumption in these locations as tutors could still check in on these locations, and, after all, grant applicants must be 21 years of age in order to receive any funding for alcohol.
The pilot program raises some questions, of course. It is unclear, for example, whether these funds will significantly benefit the social lives of underage students. Yet reviving some manner of funding for parties is preferable to no fund at all. And, while it may seem unsatisfactory that alcohol consumption will be more strictly monitored under the new system than during the Party Fund days, we cannot realistically expect the administration to indirectly fund underage student drinking, considering the potential for legal liability.
So given the many positive aspects of this program, we hope that the UC Weekend Fund will have a successful trial run this spring and that the program will become a permanent resource for Harvard’s social scene come next fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looming in the background of last November’s presidential election was the possibility that the Democrats in the Senate could reach the magic number: By holding 60 seats in the Senate, they could overcome Republican filibusters and push through a liberal agenda without significant interference from their more conservative colleagues. But the Democrats fell just short, and, for Obama’s first 100 days, the president was forced to settle for a considerable but not filibuster-proof majority. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania changed that, though, when he announced on Tuesday morning that he would defect to the Democratic Party. Senators and political pundits alike called the switch a “game-changer” because of its effect on the makeup of the Senate. This remains to be seen. However, it is remarkable in that Specter admitted that part of the impetus of the switch was to avoid a primary challenge in 2010. This cynical political calculus may not represent what his constituents in Pennsylvania voted him into office for and certainly weakens the already marginalized Republican Party.
The primary challenge in question would have come from former Representative Pat Toomey, now the frontrunner for the Pennsylvania Republican senatorial nomination in 2010. Many believe that Toomey, who led Club for Growth, a political action committee for the advancement of fiscal conservatives, is more fiscally and socially conservative than Specter, who often votes with the Democrats, especially on abortion, immigration and the environment. Specter successfully defended his post against Toomey in 2004, but his frantic party switch indicates he feared losing the rematch next year.
It is disturbing that Specter, one of the few moderate Republicans left in the Senate, would rather abandon the Republican Party than take his chances against a more conservative primary opponent. As the Republican Party shifts further away from center, Specter’s defection shows that being a successful Republican means moving toward political extremes, while being a moderate Republican means imminent unemployment. More importantly, it shows that the GOP is either drifting right on purpose or is just powerless to stop itself. Specter’s close defeat of Toomey in 2004 was likely thanks to a late endorsement from former President George W. Bush. In this way, the president protected the existence of moderate Republicans, keeping his party diverse and balanced. However, there is no such central authority in today’s Republican Party. This lack of leadership and unity is apparent in Specter’s switch (which caught Senate Republicans completely off-guard) and makes the party’s weaknesses painfully evident.
Now that Specter has shifted party loyalties, his voting record will have to prove prove this was more than a desperate attempt to remain in power beyond 2010. However, as the Republican Party line is slowly radicalized, voting left of it should become easy, especially for a senator with a history of siding with Democrats. It is this history that makes Specter’s announcement less significant to Senate politics than most Democrats would like to believe. Ultimately, voting patterns may not change that much now that Specter has a “D” after his name. However, Specter’s defection is significant in exposing the slow extinction of the moderate Republican and the further marginalization of the Republican Party.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Local media reported earlier this month that The New York Times Company has threatened to close The Boston Globe, its erstwhile New England jewel whose once-bumper profits have morphed into massive losses. It’s easy to see why Times executives are fed up—losses at The Globe this year are projected at $85 million, a heavy burden that virtually no media company can bear in today’s economic environment.
But what is frustrating about the situation is that The Times’s plans for The Globe amount to the same tired tactics that have been tried time and again—pay reductions and layoffs for Globe staff. While this might staunch a small portion of the blood—the target is to reduce the losses to $65 million—it is hardly a long-term solution. After all, given The Times’s own deteriorating finances, a $65 million loss doesn’t seem very sustainable over the long haul either. Instead of continuing this loveless marriage, the two papers ought to simply file for divorce. And they should do so the Massachusetts way: no fault, just a clean break. 
The Times could spin off The Globe to a newly-created foundation chaired by local civic and business leaders. This would allow The Times to free itself from subsidizing The Globe's losses, and allow The Globe to both significantly reduce its tax liabilities and raise donations from readers. These improvements, on top of The Globe's existing advertising and subscription base, would let the paper avoid closure—and perhaps significant layoffs as well. And unlike for most papers, the actual conversion of The Globe to a non-profit would not cost money; after all, there are no owners or shareholders to buy out, as there are for The Times Company as a whole. A similar model has already been implemented successfully in St. Petersburg, Fla. Decades ago, Nelson Poynter gave his two main media properties, the St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly, to an eponymous foundation with the directions that the papers were to be run as public trusts. Today, the St. Petersburg Times is perhaps the best newspaper from any small or moderate-sized city. In fact, just last week the paper won Pulitzer Prizes for both national reporting and feature writing.
Some media analysts have argued that newspapers should try to set up university-style endowments and live off investment returns. But such proposals are extremely far-fetched, as billions of dollars and years of work would be needed to fully endow the nation’s great newspapers. Even National Public Radio, which began to accumulate an endowment following a $225 million gift in 2003, relies on the fund for just a small fraction of its total budget. The aim of converting The Globe to a non-profit is to avert catastrophe, not to create a new model for newspapers.But, at this point, the first goal seems ambitious enough. It would truly be a shame if the nation’s most intellectual city were home only to a trashy tabloid and a few free subway papers. Bostonians who think better of their city should not fault Times executives for threatening to close their paper. They should simply offer to take it off of their hands.

Last week, the Durban Review Conference, also known as the World Conference Against Racism or Durban II, was convened in Geneva. The conference was the sequel to the 2001 meeting held in Durban, South Africa, which originally aimed to eliminate racism and xenophobia. Eight years ago, the proceedings rapidly descended into a “hate fest” as Muslim-majority states hijacked the stage as an opportunity to berate Israel and the West. While Durban II was not the same sort of vitriolic, one-sided attack that many had expected, it was nonetheless far from constructive. As such, Durban II simply served as a blunt reminder of the United Nations’s hypocrisy, ineffectiveness, and entirely unrealistic goals. 
One of the conference’s first speakers (and the only head of state to attend the conference) was Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Ahmadinejad has in the past called Israel a “rotting corpse” and advocated wiping the country off the map. Unsurprisingly, his speech at Durban II accused Israel of being “the most cruel and racist regime” in the world. But perhaps the most offensive aspect of the entire spectacle was that Ahmadinejad’s speech came on the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, when the millions of Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and their allies are remembered in Israel and around the world.
As if Ahmadinejad’s speech were not enough, members of the Iranian delegation accosted Nobel laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Weisel, who was also scheduled to speak at the conference, calling him a “Nazi” and a “Zio-Nazi.” While several nations walked out of the conference in protest of Ahmadinejad’s antics, the fact that the conference’s leadership did not stop him from acting out and even gave Ahmadinejad the floor in the first place is disgraceful and damaging to the conference’s purported goal of combating racism.
Admittedly, the Iranian delegation’s extreme actions were an aberration in what was a generally respectful diplomatic meeting. But, even so, the conference’s final declaration was simply insulting in its treatment of genocide. The 143-point “Outcome Document” states that the conference “reaffirms its support for the mandate of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, who acts, inter alia, as an early warning mechanism to prevent potential situations that could result in genocide.”
This declaration comes as the UN continues to offer no substantial relief to the people of Darfur, where more than 200,000 have already died in inter-ethnic violence. It took two years for the UN to even officially recognize the massive violence in Western Sudan, and, even then, it has not termed the massacre of innocents “genocide.” The Outcome Document devotes just one line to an expression of remembrance for the Holocaust, but it dedicates two entire paragraphs to an exhortation for “all international sporting bodies to promote…a world of sports free from racism.” Durban II’s resolutions would be comical if they were not so offensive to the survivors of genocides and to those who are currently threatened. 
Further, Durban II did not offer any substantive solutions to the ills of racism. The Outcome Document recognized that combating racism is “of crucial importance…for the promotion of cohesion, but argued that, in order to achieve this “crucial” end, it was necessary to “increase appropriate preventive measures to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination.” So, essentially, in order to eliminate racism, it is important to eliminate racism. The document did suggest that national governments, non-governmental organizations, and the media could all be involved in the process, but actual mechanisms for achieving the end of racism were nowhere to be found.
In the end, the much-heralded conference made only two concrete recommendations, and both were objectionable. The first recommendation was that all countries ought to afford a right to freedom of opinion and expression to all citizens in order to combat racism. But, without even a hint of irony, the conference also resolved that states should “prohibit all organizations based on ideas or theories of superiority of one race or group of persons of one colour or ethnic origin, or which attempt to justify or promote national, racial, and religious hatred and discrimination in any form.” According to the framers of the Durban II resolution, the right to freedom of thought and expression is vital—except when such thought promotes a negative sense of national or religious pride, in which case it should be made illegal. 
The other concrete recommendation of the Durban II conference was that states take legal action to combat “xenophobic attitudes towards and negative stereotyping of non-citizens.” Further passages in the document excoriate states that discriminate against immigrants, whether legal or not. This anti-nationalistic, pro-globalization sentiment is fraught with problems, particularly as the UN cannot possibly enforce or even evaluate whether states accept large amounts of immigrants and whether their immigration policies are liberal. There were further resolutions promoting democracy and multiculturalism and resolutions against assimilation and nationalism. The conference’s resolutions were generally naïve and impractical, even when they were clearly articulated.
Therefore, while Durban II may not have been a “hate fest,” it was still deeply flawed. The conference was heated, insulting, and did not engender positive strides toward ending racism. Further, the resolutions adopted were, on the whole, both infeasible and unrealistic. Repressive regimes in Saudi Arabia and China (among other participants in the conference) have little incentive to actually implement the resolutions, and the UN has no way to actually enforce them. The lack of concrete standards and suggestions further undermines the purpose of the conference, and it can therefore be considered a failure.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a little more than a month, Harvard will graduate yet another class of seniors and commend them to prestigious positions in regions far-flung across the globe. Even with the economic downturn, no doubt this class—like all before it—will eventually fill the highest echelons in government, finance, law, and academia.
In conferring the degree, embossed with the university seal and confirmed by the president’s signature, Harvard thereby will stake its reputation on the intellectual fitness and aptitude of each recipient. Few indeed would doubt the natural intelligence, raw talent, and competence of most, if not all, of those in line for a sheepskin. But whether the last four years have augmented or molded those natural capacities in which newly arrived Harvard freshmen abound remains an open question. 
Complaints about the Core and the nascent General Education—its lack of common requirements or a coherent, unifying philosophy—are rehearsed often. And the demise of a potential Great Books track within Gen Ed called further attention to this problem. The prevalence of grade inflation and the existence of trendy but “soft” disciplines in the humanities and social sciences continue to portend trouble to those concerned with Harvard’s intellectual rigor. 
But these standard jeremiads against Harvard’s curricular vacuity, as just and true as they are, only extend so far. For one cannot seriously contest whether Harvard graduates are brilliant, well read, and extremely likely to succeed at whichever tasks they choose to apply themselves. Yet, despite this, one cannot but have serious reservations about these graduates’ cultivation, moral virtue, and character, over which Harvard as educator claims no responsibility.
In a kinder and gentler era, universities sought—as many of this region’s more ancient preparatory schools still ostensibly do—to educate not only the mind but also the “whole person.” For, in those days, Harvard and others cared not so much that their graduates were successful at their chosen professions as that they were decent, upstanding, and honorable gentlemen who would not bring shame upon their almae matres by their ill conduct.
The notions of honor and character to most Harvard students sound old-fashioned, if not completely absurd. Yet, at one point, such concerns formed the center of a truly moral education. Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics listed “greatness of soul,” or “magnanimity,” among the principal moral virtues—as the “crown” of the virtues, in fact, without which the other moral virtues cannot properly exist. For one who exemplifies all the moral virtues—an ideal toward which men of a previous age continuously would strive—proudly disdains base and trivial matters and values not material goods as much as the well-deserved respect of a good man. The magnanimous man, who seeks great honors while deserving them, necessarily is also a good man, the ideal gentleman.
Neither Harvard nor contemporary university pedagogy esteems this old ideal. The intellectual fads that currently enthrall academia long ago abdicated any concern with ends: Education, under this regime, is merely a question of means. Students indeed may write well and argue their points persuasively and powerfully, but toward which goal and on behalf of which argument they may exercise their faculties are questions never asked. Scientific training, assisted by advanced technology, points toward an ever-expanding horizon of information to be gathered and knowledge to be pursued, but with little concern for what purpose such research ultimately may be used.
Universities like Harvard still purport to teach the liberal arts, those studies worthy of a free man. Such a curriculum once itself implied an ideal, an end. The liberal arts, indeed, have had as their object to cultivate the “gentleman,” in the sense that the word implies a distinction, a high standard that presumably all, and probably most, can never attain—and not as we often use the term today, to welcome every male individual who passes through the door of a public restroom. A liberal education aspires to make men’s minds liberal, worthy of being free: those who are free from acting according to base motives, such as personal gain, and can practice the virtues for their own sake. 
Modern college curricula have no regard for the virtues. The wisdom offered in classrooms, if not, as in the admittedly “applied” sciences, purely instrumental, is then essentially a curiosity, since it has no relationship to the good life. And, as such, graduates will be left uninstructed as to how they ought to use, or how they ought to act with, the knowledge they have gained and the natural intelligence they have sharpened over the last four years.
The lack of a moral ideal in education bodes especially problematic in the case of Harvard students, who, already confident and ambitious, deserve to have their talents and energies directed toward a suitably noble end. Those students, without due guidance, understandably will concern themselves first with gainfully employing their knowledge and skill for either money or power, and only secondarily, if at all, with the responsible and respectable ideal that their university and most in their generation abandoned long ago.

BY KATHERINE A. KUZMA
Over a decade ago, Lecturer on History Trygve V. R. Throntveit ’01, a St. Paul, Minn. native, arrived on Harvard’s campus for his undergraduate education. Young, eager, and motivated, Throntveit pursued a History and Literature degree. Soon, he was turning the heads of professors with his ideas on William James’s pragmatism and its effects on American politics, and won the Ralph Waldo Emerson prize in his junior year. 
Of course, there must have been something beyond the Boston weather that inspired him to stick around, as he proceeded to stay at Harvard not only to earn his master’s and Ph.D. under Professor of American History James T. Kloppenberg, but also to teach others as a lecturer in the History department. It may look like fate in hindsight—both of his parents are teachers—but he was never certain that he would be following in their footsteps.
“I didn’t always know that I wanted to be a historian,” Throntveit says. “I thought I wanted to stay in school because I always liked it and then everything else just kind of happened.”
In spite of his initial uncertainty, there has been a high demand for Throntveit’s teaching. This year alone, he introduced two new courses to the history department, History 1452: “American Politics and Society, Reconstruction to the Present” and History 1461: “War and the World of Ideas in America, Civil War to Iraq.” 
In one of his History 1452 lectures on the Vietnam War and the end of Richard Nixon’s presidency, Throntveit filled the board with detailed outlines from end to end. Though Throntveit breezed through the dense material effortlessly, he refrains from deeming himself an expert on the topic.
“Trygve combines intellectual ambition and personal modesty, a winning combination in and out of the classroom,” Kloppenberg says.  “Those qualities have made him equally successful in our graduate program and as a lecturer in the History Department this year.”
His students, mentors, and peers would agree that one of Throntveit’s strengths is his innate ability to convey ideas, which uniquely enables him to speak about topics that may not even be in his area of expertise.
“He is a really great communicator,” says Adam Ewing, the head teaching fellow of History 1452. “He is able to explain very complicated political or intellectual ideas in very clear and digestible ways.”
This does not only apply in the lecture hall, but outside the classroom as well.
“He is also very approachable,” Ewing adds. “It encourages student participation and allows students to come up to him and seek his guidance.  He’s been a great mentor.”
As a recent addition to Harvard’s faculty, Throntveit’s future as a professor has not been set, but according to Kloppenberg, he has been hired as the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Studies in History. Given his significant contributions to Harvard and his flexibility with plans, Throntveit is on a path to continue educating and guiding students for years to come.

Ever the inquisitive scholar, Associate Professor of History Alison F. Frank had the inspiration for a book while doing some pleasure reading on a beach in Greece.  
“One of the characters was interested in the oil fields of Galicia, and I wondered if that was a complete fabrication,” she says. 
That’s because Galicia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now a region split between Poland and Ukraine, is not exactly known for its oil reserves. By 2005, careful research and writing turned the question into an award-winning book, “Oil Empire: Visions of Prosperity in Austrian Galicia.” She discovered that an oil boom had occurred in Galicia during the 19th century, but overeager extraction of the resource spurred by a lack of government regulation led to a shortage of oil in the empire by World War I.  
Although “Oil Empire” is a work of scholarship, Frank didn’t intend for it to be a book that only scholars would read. For her, the key to writing and teaching history is to find out how it matters to people who are interested and intelligent but not experts. 
“In a sense, whenever you go and teach, you’re making an argument for the relevance of whatever you’re talking about,” she says. 
And according to Peter G. Bacon ’11, a student in Frank’s course History 1266: “Central Europe 1789-1918,” she’s doing a good job.  
“As a lecturer, she’s very, very, very excellent,” he says. “She brings a very fresh take on weighty and dense topics like nationalism and German reunification.” 
Frank became interested in Central and Eastern Europe as a high school student in the last days of the Cold War, when she found herself drawn to the world that Ronald Reagan once referred to as the “Evil Empire.” She majored in German studies and Russian and East European studies at Williams College, and after working as a consultant for health care in Poland, decided to enter graduate school at Harvard to explore the history behind the region. 
“Every time I tried to understand what was happening, I found myself needing to understand the Second World War, and the First World War, and then the 19th century,” she says. 
As an expert on modern European history, she speaks German, French, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, and Italian. She praises the language courses at Harvard to which she always refers students seeking to do research in a particular region. Even she has taken up Italian classes in the Romance Languages and Literatures department in preparation for her next book on the port city of Trieste. 
“What saddens me are students who think, because they’re sophomores or juniors in college, it’s too late to learn such-and-such languages,” she says.  
Others have noticed Frank’s commitment to education. Brendan J. Karch, the teaching fellow for History 1266, knows Frank as a member of the committee that reads his dissertation. Although he was expecting her to skim through one of his drafts, Karch was surprised when she returned his dissertation with extensive comments. She had even corrected the grammatical mistakes in the footnotes.   
On another occasion, Frank called Karch after going to the emergency room. Despite her doctor’s recommendation that she stay at the hospital, Professor Frank was still trying to leave and lecture in class as scheduled. 
“Thankfully, she chose her health,” he says.

The hallway leading off of the Quincy JCR is a quiet one with muted white walls, a hushed brown carpet, and subdued maroon doors. Until you reach office #6—a door which, unlike its silent fellows, is covered with colorful photos, portraits, and bumper stickers which roar: “United for Peace, Divided in War,” “Hate is Not a Family Value” and “DARE to Speak Truth to Power.” Inside, surrounded on one side by a jam-packed floor-to-ceiling bookshelf, on the other side by certificates and articles that cover the stretch of wall above his desk, and on the third side by a window looking over a bustling Mount Auburn Street,  Lecturer on History and Literature Timothy P. McCarthy  ’93 doesn’t appear to hear the noise.  
“I’m a voracious guy,” McCarthy says. He chuckles as he sits at his desk amidst the piles of books and various framed photographs that surround him. He adds, “I eat well and drink deeply as one of my friends once said; in food and drink and also in life. And I do. And it’s how I’ve always lived.”  
McCarthy’s penchant for living a full life is evidenced by his myriad of activities; his academic schedule alone is daunting. In addition to his position as a lecturer in History and Literature, McCarthy is a member of the tutorial board for the Committee on Degrees in Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality, and an adjunct lecturer on Public Policy and faculty research affiliate at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School.  
“Tim is, year in and year out, a dedicated and inspiring teacher who represents some of the best that Harvard has to offer,” says Andrew J. Romig, assistant director of studies for the History and Literature department. 
In addition to these scholarly pursuits, McCarthy also throws himself into public service work. As the Academic Director of the Bard College Clemente Course in the Humanities, McCarthy travels twice a week to Dorchester, Mass. to run a college humanities course for low-income adults. He is also the founding director and leader of the yearly alternative spring break trip to the South that reconstructs black churches burnt down in racially motivated arsons.
 He’s always looking to others to enrich his own life and to enrich the lives of others,” says Julia K. Lindpaintner ’09, who has participated in the trip for the past three years and has been a student leader for the trip for the past two years. “He takes real pride and puts a lot of energy into connecting with the people around him.” 
McCarthy’s passion for public service and activism led him to lead and participate in rallies and protests throughout his years at Harvard. Most notably, his consistent criticism of the Bush administration post-9/11 earned him the number 32 spot on a “black list” published by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni of 117 academics “short on patriotism.” 
“And that’s when I became strong for the first time,” says McCarthy, recounting the hate mail and death threats he received after making unpopular statements. “When I felt like, you know what, I am right. And I don’t care if anyone else is with me right now.” 
In his personal life, McCarthy has applied the same dedication and enthusiasm he brings to academia and advocacy. As a senior resident tutor and LGBT advisor in Quincy House where he lived as a student, he relishes his role as a part of the undergraduate experience. “I’m fully part of the rhythm of Harvard College,” said McCarthy. “And I’m not a particularly good dancer but I feel like if there’s a song that I dance to pretty well it’s that song,” he adds. 
“He spreads himself really thin,” says Allston Burr Resident Dean of Quincy House, Judith F. Chapman. “There are so many times I see him in the dining hall and he’s been up all night writing…[in this respect] Tim, he still lives a lot like an undergrad does.” 
Even though he is committed to so many activities, McCarthy takes time to reflect and find perspective. “At the end of the day, the thing that matters is how you’ve affected the lives of others and how you’ve allowed other people to affect you,” says McCarthy, as sun streamed through the window of his Quincy office. “If a measure of a life is the number and quantity of good relationships in it, then I’m as healthy as they come.”

I sat at my grandmother’s old Singer sewing machine, under my fourth floor window, and looked out over the white flower box filled with her pink, purple, and white impatiens.  They tumbled over the sides of the box, pampered by her green-thumb treatment. That was 1993 and I was six years old.
I saw well-cropped grass and several cars in the driveway, but I knew that my grandmother saw something quite different. She leaned over my shoulder to rethread the bobbin I habitually tangled as she taught me to make a patchwork quilt. She was transported. She looked out the same window, but instead saw the hills of central Kentucky of 70 years ago.
Peonies and tomatoes were her home.  When my family moved from Manhattan to a well-heeled neighborhood on the fringes of urban Cincinnati, it was my grandmother who braved the mosquito and chigger colonies of our hilly backyard and put trowel to the clay-packed soil.  She drove wooden stakes into the ground for the tomato vines, and bared small circles for the peonies.  The garden was complete with a compost pile, and when turned out with a shovel, spilled dark black soil and worms.  It was as if a patch of her hometown of Zilpo, Kentucky had been re-rooted to my backyard. 
I loved spending time with my maternal grandmother, who lived with us when I was young.  I loved sewing but hated it at the same time. Why I was pricking myself with needles, tacking together scraps of fabric to make a quilt, when bed comforters were for sale at Lazarus?   
We made everything ourselves.  It wasn’t just Granny—my mother did too.  Snack day in elementary school warranted a night of baking.  My classmates brought bagged popcorn or Saltines, but my mother started the night before. She baked bread, mixed flour, yeast, milk, and eggs in her large silver bowl.  My snack day became so anticipated in Mrs. Reynolds’s class that kids would talk about it days in advance.  My mother never knew, nor I suspect minded, that other kids brought store-bought popcorn. 
It wasn’t about the money; in my family, we made before we bought. For my grandmother, this was obvious.  Her values rested in the 1920s town of Zilpo, where townsfolk didn’t know why you would buy new drapes if the ones you had blocked the sun okay, or if you could make them yourself.  Didn’t see the reason for a new table if there was one in the sitting room already; besides, what would you do with another table anyway, buy more trinkets to cover it?  They did, however, realize the need for a post-office, and it was Granny’s mother, my great-grandmother, Zillie Power, who established it.  At least she got the town named after her; you don’t get a town named after you for buying a new table. 
My grandmother would grumble whenever she found a spare penny around the house.  She would scoop it up and huff.
“You rich people, you’ve always got money laying around!” she said.
 “Granny, it’s just a penny!” I said.
“Well, now I’m one cent richer than you are,” she said. Then she would wink so fast, you might miss it.
She lived through the years of the Great Depression, and resourcefulness meant frugality.  Benjamin Franklin’s famous words “A penny saved is a penny earned” was her personal credo.  Even several years after her death, she still receives coupons for Victoria’s Secret mailed to our address (who knew?).
In her honor, of course, we are compelled to use them. 
Back at the sewing machine, my grandmother guided the next fabric scrap under the silver foot just as she had with my mother 40 years before.  Though it was 1993, and I was in Cincinnati, I was no exception to the Appalachian heritage of my family.
Naturally, the quilt was to be a patchwork, a blend of bits on hand.  Because my grandmother had always made shirts, pants and dresses for her four daughters when they were children, her walk-in closet was a patchwork paradise.  I sewed the fabric squares; Granny insisted that the right angles met in 90-degree perfection.  (No wonder my mother became an architect.)  The flashing needle tacked together vestiges of white dresses, red-checkered shorts, turquoise blue blouses and a dusty-rose colored skirt.  Nothing matched, but that was the point. 
In his introductory note for Encyclopedia of Appalachia, Professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. wrote, “Appalachia never leaves us.” While the Appalachian region refers to the mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia, the values have no borders; they stay with the people, not necessarily with the land.   
My grandmother taught me the ways of this land, a land of winding dirt roads and hills peppered with rolls of hay perched on hillsides like giant spools of thread.  In my Currier dorm room, I have a patchwork quilt on my bed and pencil holders made of reused tea canisters on my desk.  It is a direct result of the strength and permanence of Appalachian values and Granny’s—my family’s—diligence in their preservation. 
 “Where did you get that quilt?” my roommate asked me this year.
 “My grandmother made it,” I said.

A group of actors sat in folding chairs, arranged in a semi-circle. They read lines from scripts resting on black music stands. “Talk of children at the age of 20 is a definite mark of crazy,” one actor said. He played a character named Nick, an English major with serious game. The audience roared with laughter, but he wasn’t finished yet. “You need to learn when to pull out...of a relationship,” Nick quipped. Where could you have listened to the advice of such a sagely wisecracking (fictional) bro? Too bad, you missed out unless you attended Harvard’s inaugural Playwrights Festival, which was held April 23 through April 26 at the New College Theatre. The festival of staged readings was the culmination of the semester-long efforts of undergraduates in English Camr: “Advanced Playwrighting 2,” a workshop taught jointly by Briggs-Copeland lecturer Christine M. Evans and Gideon Lester, the 2008-2009 director of the American Repertory Theatre (A.R.T.).“[Evans and I] both felt that although seminars are good for introductory playwrights, in the end playwrights really learn best when they get to collaborate with directors and actors and dramaturges,” Lester said. “And they get to test whether their plays are really working in time and space and in the bodies of actors.”Harvard students collaborated with directors and dramaturges from the A.R.T., who aided in the staging, character, and plot development of the 10 undergraduate plays. “It was nice to come into an environment where professionals were working with us,” said Matthew I. Boher ’10, a member of the class (and author of the Nick character).Ranging from hilariously awkward to wryly introspective, the works featured true-to-life dialogue and plenty of colorful characters. Sara L. Wright ’09 opened the festival with a play entitled “The Late Mr. Crawford.” Wright was greeted with thundering applause and warm hugs from teachers and friends. “This is one of the most supportive environments,” Wright said after the reading of her play.“We’re incredibly proud of our playwrights and really excited by this,” said Evans. “We hope that in future years, more student-written plays will get onstage among all the famous dead people’s plays.”

If you surf, you’ve got Hollister. If you play polo you’ve got, well, Polo. And now, thanks to one enterprising Harvard Law School student, those who play lacrosse have Status Flow.When co-founder Kevin A. Valsi, a second-year student at HLS, launched Status Flow Clothing last year, he was hoping to capitalize on lacrosse’s growing popularity among high school and college students by catering to what he characterized as an under-served subculture.  “I found it interesting and surprising that there weren’t any brands associated with the sport,” said Valsi, who played club lacrosse at the University of Maryland. “There’s a lot of branding built around surfing and skating. You know, niche sports?” Valsi saw a cultural dichotomy in lacrosse, and he said his main creative obstacle in the design process was negotiating that division. “Lacrosse started out as an Ivy League sport,” he said. “So part of it is very preppy. But another element is very laid back.” But Crimson lacrosse players were hesitant about that interpretation of the lax scene.  Co-captain Sam H. Slaughter ’09, while he agreed that the team doesn’t favor specific brands, said he doesn’t see that as evidence of a sartorial void. “It’s like trying to say: What do all baseball players wear?” he said. “It’s not like a cult; it’s just like any other sport.” Slaughter, though pleased with lacrosse’s popularity, disagreed with Valsi’s cultural assessment. “Lacrosse isn’t a rich kid, preppy thing or just a hanging out thing. That’s not the attitude the teams take,” he said. “I don’t think that’s what the sport’s about.” Nevertheless, he said he expects the line to do well. So far, Status Flow has found distribution online and with mid-Atlantic boutique Urban Chic. Alexandra R. Ebright, store manager and merchandiser at the chain’s Baltimore location, said that sales have been “great.” Ebright said she already sees the line as cornering an unexpected market: “It has sold really well to our guy customers just looking for something that can transition from playing sports to going out at night.”Valsi, who is working on expanding nationally, is optimistic about the future possibilities of lacrosse culture. He explains that the culture is even reflected in his company’s name: “‘Flow’ is the lacrosse mullet. It’s a longer hairstyle.” Stylish.

The last day of classes is here, and that means it’s time to get drunk and sloppy. Stumble up to Spanish class.  Tell Gov 20 that you love it, many times, in a loud voice. Maybe drunk dial Ec 10.  Here are some rules to drink by:    1. Any lecture that ends to the tune of “and that is why Ancient Etruscan Transgender Practices are important to your life today” deserves a hearty toast, for effort at least.   2. If your hot TF seems suspiciously more flirtatious than usual, offer her/him a swig of Rubinov from your Poland Springs bottle. This is your last chance.  Ask them when you could meet to talk about your paper; when they answer, explain that you will unfortunately be bedridden at that time. Then just wink. Then maybe take a shot and try winking again.   3. If your professor is dressed down for class, wearing summer clothing instead of his normal suit, take one shot. Also, playfully acknowledge his effort by taking off your shirt.   4. By this time of the semester, your professor’s voice may sound only like a mild buzzing that occasionally changes in pitch slightly.  Approach this like it is a power hour.   5. Ask your TF penetrating and thoughtful questions about their summer plans. For every minute you get them to indulgently divulge, everyone else has to take a shot. Stealing questions is fair game.   6. Sit behind the girl that’s always on her Gmail during lecture. Every e-mail she gets about a summer internship is one shot. If she has another one of those awkward Gchats with her boyfriend about staying in touch over the summer, that’s a shot also (excessive use of emoticons is double).

Though bell-bottoms and daisy chains remain relics of the ’60s, student activism at Harvard is anything but history. SLAM, the Student Labor Action Movement, has become increasingly vocal in the past few months. Harvard students are likely to encounter SLAM’s campaign against layoffs on an average stroll through the yard—perhaps in the form of student activists holding signs, waving banners, or sporting screen-printed t-shirts branded with SLAM’s polemical slogan, “Greed is the New Crimson.” As the school year draws to a close, the campaign has been ramping up its activities and turning heads. The question is: will SLAM be able to turn the right heads—the heads that make budgeting decisions—before students move out and the money is doled out? CREATIVE COMMUNICATIONS“We’re trying to stay as much in contact and try to be as visible as we can around campus to show that this is a problem that is not going to go away,” says SLAM member Johnny F. Bowman ’11. “Right now, we’re going to start being a little more creative with the ways in which we make ourselves visible.” Part of SLAM’s strategy is to make its message as pervasive as possible on campus. According to Bowman, SLAM hopes to show its support for workers in some way every day. The campaign is a multi-media effort, and this recent surge in activity is evident in SLAM’s blog, which is updated almost daily.  For those desiring real-time updates, SLAM is now posting its ins and outs in a more distilled form on Twitter.com.  This week, SLAM, in collaboration with the Harvard College Democrats, released a Youtube.com video about the human cost of layoffs which already has over 2,000 views. Produced by Warren S. Loegering ’12, the video tells the story of Bedardo Sola, a worker who was laid off March 16th but rehired due to student advocacy. Sola refers to Harvard students as the workers’ “secret weapon.”“SECRET WEAPON” SLAM activists realize that the student voice is a powerful “secret weapon” and seek to use it to call attention to the workers’ plight. “[The workers] don’t have the same access to people that can make changes at Harvard as the students do,” Alyssa M. Aguilera ’08-’09 says. “We want to help get the stories of workers out.”In order to accomplish this, SLAM hosted a panel, composed of workers, that aimed to give Harvard employees a chance to speak. SLAM also staged a rally outside of the Holyoke center, which had an impressive student as well as worker turnout.  “There were a lot of people at the rally I had never seen at SLAM events before,” says Zach P. Hughes ’12, a member of SLAM. “Seeing such a large response from the student body was really encouraging.”SLAM has helped articulate the workers voices not only through words, but numbers. As of earlier this week, 624 students, parents, alumni, student organizations, and faculty have signed onto SLAM’s petition for the prevention of layoffs and the restoration of lost jobs. INFORMATION FOR THE ADMINSTRATIONThough the increase in student support is encouraging, SLAM has heard little in response from the Harvard Administration. Though five SLAM representatives met with President Drew Faust during her office hours last week, they are unsure if their meeting will have an effect. Earlier this month, students visited the Harvard Management Company in Boston and requested a meeting to discuss layoffs. SLAM representatives were able to meet with the HMC earlier this year, and found their discussion productive. Their most recent trip did not end as fruitfully; the HMC had changed its visitor policy such that all appointments required arrangements in advance. “This time when we came into visit, we overhead the secretary say ‘uh oh,’” Bowman says. “They had changed the visitor policy after our first visit. They apparently viewed it as a hostile act.”“Students and workers are systematically excluded from the decision making process, and they haven’t offered any other ways for us to engage in meaningful dialogue,” Aguilera adds. SLAM member Seth A. Pearce ’12 emphasized that the campaign does not seek to personally attack Harvard administrators. “I think whenever you’re criticized, you’re bound to feel attacked, but that isn’t the intention. We’re just trying to saturate them with information.” The administration claims that there are expenditures it is locked into paying each year and cannot cut back on—a financial burden that is compounded by the costs of expansions projects and additions to the faculty. Workers salaries account for a sizable percentage of expendable costs, and for this reason Harvard has offered a retirement incentive package so it can lighten its financial load without laying off as many workers.“A PLACE OF LOVE”One the main of counter-arguments SLAM faces is that, given the economic crisis, many companies are having to lay off workers and Harvard is not any different.  “I think this is misled,” says SLAM member Remeike J.B. Forbes ’11. “It’s kind of peculiar to see Harvard as analogous to GM, because Harvard is a nonprofit institution. When GM lays off workers they also decrease in production as well. Harvard is not a for-profit institution, its purpose is to serve a public good.” According to Taj E. Tucker ’12, a protester at SLAM’s recent rally, “We have too many luxuries here to be cutting down on peoples livelihoods. There are other sacrifices the community should make before laying off workers.”SLAM claims that it is interested in helping the administration brainstorm more creative ways to tailor the budget such that layoffs would not be necessary. Their blog points to other academic institutions, such as Stanford and Washington University, where top administrators are taking pay cuts of up to 10%. “Harvard should be a model for the world,” Pearce says. “And part of that is having a community that values all of its members. Our campaign really comes from fact that we love the Harvard community, and it would be a tragedy for it to be broken up by layoffs. It’s coming from a place of love rather than a place of rebellion.”

We originally pitched our idea for a special double issue of FM—two unrelated features; “15 Down and Out  Professors,” and “15 Up and Coming Fat Chicks.” Through a series of clerical errors, we have the issue you read today.Prestige and Mobility is all about unsung heroes, such as ourselves. We heroically detained rap mega-sensation Fabolous and managed to prevent him from attending Eleganza. Why, you ask? We are not at liberty to say, except for the fact that he had been infected with Swine Flu by the perverted designs of Registrar Barry S. Kane, who plotted to use the rapper’s magnetic persona and popular lyrics to give all four of Harvard’s hot girls a deadly disease.But this issue is all about the professors. We’d like to take a moment and recognize some of our favorites for their hard work, determination, and University of Phoenix Online PhD’s.[1]Sujoy Mukhopadhay: Everyone knows that TFs are more likely to hook up with you than actual professors. Sujoy Mukhopadhay, a bold and determined educator, shatters that stereotype. I mean, SHATTERS. Just make sure that the correct pronunciation of his last name isn’t your “safe word.”Tobbias Ritter: His boyish good looks and affinity for pranks (who switched sodium hydrocloride with sodium hydroclorate?!!?) have earned him the title, “Ashton Kutcher of the Chemistry Department.” He still needs some work on his signature catchphrase, “You just got (chemical) burned!”Adam Cohen: He’s “Assistant Professor of Chemistry AND Chemical Biology AND of Physics.” We’d like to tell you a parable, A-dumb, about a little boy who wore too many hats. He wore a fez, a sombrero, and a beret. No one liked him because he just couldn’t choose one hat, and insisted on always wearing all three, despite the fact that doing so was cumbersome and ostentatious. Soon, he had people of three different ethnicities beating him in the streets. Just keep that in mind, Adam. Keep that in mind.Cassandra Extavour: According to her Web site, she specializes in “gamete production.” Oh really, Cassandra? We’ve mastered not only gamete production, but distribution and cleanup…and for some reason, no one’s rushing to put our name in FM. Women in sciences, eh? [twirl moustache here].Gonzalo Giribet: The all-star of the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department. He made a name for himself studying obese women and their oversized tweety bird t-shirts, though he has yet to replicate his results outside of a Six Flags Theme Park. Keep on rollin’, Gonzalo. Tweet tweet! Recently, he pioneered his theory of “Hot Chicks and Their Assistants,” in which he posits that every hot chick has a noticeably less hot assistant, who helps her with doing all her hot chick stuff, busses her tray, and schedules appointments for potential suitors. Fieldwork in Adams dining hall is ongoing.Alison Frank: We are withholding our opinion on her until we get a copy of her monograph, “Shemales in the Mist.” [2] Joshua Greene: This darling of the psychology department tackles some of the hardest moral dilemmas humans face and investigates how emotions and “gut reactions” shape our moral sense. His current projects include answering the question, “Ought one feel remorse for ethnically cleansing a bag of gummi bears to leave the flavors one deems most delicious?” We also hear he’s collaborating with Gonzalo Giribet, applying the logic of hot chicks and their assistants to the classic trolley car problem. Tell us, Joshua, would you sacrifice five hot chick assistants to spare one hot chick? If so, who would assist that hot chick with all that stuff that only hot chicks do?Timothy McCarthy: A lot of solid work lately. Keep it up, and one day you’ll get an abstract in THURJ.Glenda Carpio: This scholar in the Af-Am and English Department has been working round the clock to fill in her Venn diagram of commonalities between Meg Ryan, Karl Malone, and Vinnie Chiappini. Hint, Glenda: It’s an affinity for John Stockton! Sound fundamentals AND short shorts? Who wouldn’t want to ‘pick and roll’ with him? [3]Xiaofei Tian: A rising star in the East Asian Languages and Civilizations department, he has constantly worked to improve relations between the AAA [Asian American Association] and the AAA [Admirers of Asians Association], the latter composed exclusively of a blocking group in Dunster and every male CS concentrator. We here at FM fear these two groups might merge into one, soon creating tons of beautiful half Asian children that love solid Confucian values almost as much as they love the snappin’ melodies of Coldplay.[1] The best way to ensure academic excellence is to demand it.[2] So THAT’S where they’ve been![3] Kirby Puckett. That’s who. And maybe Greg Ostertag.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities Judith H. Kidd will accept the administration’s retirement incentive package and retire from her post this summer, Kidd confirmed to The Crimson yesterday.“It was a very difficult choice to make, and I suspect it would always be difficult to leave,” Kidd said.The retirement plan, announced earlier this semester as a cost-cutting measure, allows staff members over 55 years of age with at least 10 years of service as of June 30 to voluntarily choose early retirement.During the six years since her post was created, Kidd has overseen the openings of the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub and the Harvard College Women’s Center, and has worked to increase opportunities and services for students involved in extracurricular activities.“I think having an Associate Dean of Student Life and Activities is a very big accomplishment for a school that had previously not given much focus to student life,” Kidd said.Campus Life Fellow Jason B. McCoy ’08 said that Kidd will be strongly missed in the Student Life and Activities Office, noting that she strikes the perfect balance between humor and pragmatism.“She’s very strong and doesn’t get pushed around and has the students’ best interest at heart,” said Program Coordinator for Student Events and Activities Haining Gouinlock ’07, who has worked with Kidd both professionally and on committees as a student.Kidd first came to Harvard in 1996 to serve as Assistant Dean for Public Service and Director of Phillips Brooks House. Kidd’s arrival was marred with controversy as PBHA members grappled with the administration over the organization’s structure and its relationship with the College. The contention continued when Kidd was accused of attempting to fire the long-time PBHA bookkeeper and comptroller—an officer of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—which pegged Kidd as part of the anti-union administration.In 2005, Kidd’s relationship with student groups was again thrust into the spotlight after she threatened to shut down a planned student protest of the presence of CIA and Department of Homeland Security recruiters on campus, only to later abandon that position. But this past fall, Kidd reminded the student body of the College’s free speech protections after several members of the Harvard Right to Life group reported that their posters had been vandalized. Kidd said that in the future she hopes the Student Life and Activities Office will work to increase the amount of faculty involvement in co-curricular activities and continue to foster collaboration between student life and house life.After retiring, Kidd said she plans to go on an African safari, a trip funded by the money she received from winning the Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators’ prize last year. The award gives recipients a $7,100 stipend and a month of paid leave in which to use it.Kidd will also serve as a chair of the Board of Directors of the Brookline Community Foundation. Kidd said she hopes to find a way to continue working with college students, though she is leaving her options open at the moment.“I’m trying not to get myself too committed,” Kidd said. “I want to keep myself open to this new period of exploration.”—Staff writer Lauren D.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When what is now the Harvard Kennedy School was founded seven decades ago, its chief donor sought a school to educate future leaders in government.To this day, the School’s mission statement charges it “to train enlightened public leaders and to generate the ideas that provide the answers to our most challenging public problems.”But as increasing numbers of graduates enter the private sector—because of debt concerns or pressure from corporate recruiting—some students have concluded the School has fallen short of its lofty aim.In 2007, 41 percent of HKS graduates entered the private sector, the highest level in over a decade, and some students say the figure reflects a failing on the part of administrators to promote public sector careers.“That statistic, 41 percent, points to a larger problem at the School,” says Douglas A. Levine, a 2008 Kennedy School graduate.Last spring, he and other alarmed peers mobilized students, faculty, and administrators to address what they say is a distressing discrepancy between the Kennedy School’s mission and its reality.And while last year saw the number of graduates entering the private sector drop to 35 percent, many students say more needs to be done.But while students have sought changes to promote the school’s mission of public services, they say administrators have not taken the issue seriously.“I think good intentions are there,” says Alicia S. Kaskela, co-chair of the Student Public Service Collaborative. “But I don’t think they’ve really been borne out in practice.”‘ZERO COMMUNICATION’While students say they believe the Kennedy School, and especially its current dean, David T. Ellwood ’75, is committed to public service, they remain concerned that the school is ignoring a recent trend away from the public sector.This February, the Kennedy School Student Government passed a resolution calling for the school to promote public service, a move that conveyed student resentment at what many considered the administration’s unilateral decision to eliminate the position of Director of Public Service.“There was zero communication from the administration,” said Student Government President Benjamin M. Polk at the time. “It illustrated this lack of engagement between student leaders and major decisions at the Kennedy School that I think students need to have some sort of representation in.”The resolution also asked that Ellwood reconvene the Dean’s Committee on Public Service, a group of student leaders, faculty members, and top-level administrators that first assembled in spring 2008.Spearheaded by 2008 HKS graduate Jeffrey R. Ginsburg, the committee aimed to meet every semester to strengthen the Kennedy School’s culture of public service.But the committee only met once, a statistic which Ginsburg calls alarming. “My understanding was that there was a plan,” he says. “The Dean had committed to me and the group that it was going to meet on a regular basis.”Students say the resolution surprised the administration, which appeared to be unaware of the strong student sentiments surrounding the issue.“I think the Dean was really taken aback,” says Jessica K. Reitz, a co-chair of the Student Public Service Collaborative, a student organization that arose from the Dean’s Committee on Public Service.Ellwood could not be reached for comment for this article.In response, administrators met with student leaders, reaffirming their commitment to public service and allaying some student concerns. Now, students say they hope the administration will follow the meetings with action.LIES, DAMNED LIES, AND STATISTICSBut despite widespread concern among students over recent percentages of graduates going to the private sector, administrators say the statistics have been blown out of proportion.“I don’t believe there is a cause for concern,” says Sandy Hessler, director of the Office of Career Advancement. She says that of the 35 percent of 2008 graduates who entered the private sector, about a third entered a public-private partnership, which would suggest that closer to three-fourths of students actually entered public service careers.Even last year’s decline in private sector employment—from 41 percent in 2007 to 35 percent—may not reflect a real change, but rather result from a higher student response rate to post-graduation surveys in 2008, casting doubt on the accuracy of the numbers that have fueled the debate.Still, Director of Degree Programs Joseph McCarthy says the numbers are somewhat concerning.“When that percentage [of students entering the private sector] begins to rise above one-third of our graduates, it makes me a little uneasy,” he says. “But it does fluctuate from time to time.”McCarthy adds that he thinks public service can also be done from a private sector platform. But some students disagree.“We had a skepticism that some huge portion of people going into private sector would be working on public problems,” Ginsburg says. “And even if they were working on it, it wasn’t their mission to serve the public sector.”But administrators say their response to the issue of public sector employment has been adequate and reflects their desire to continue the school’s mission to train public leaders.“We’re always looking and keeping track to make sure we’re doing everything we can to support students who want to go into the public sector,” says Sarah E. Wald, chief of staff for the Dean’s Office at the Kennedy School.CAUSE AND EFFECTA February survey of the HKS student body found that 79 percent of students intended to go into public service after graduation. Though this number is high, it suggests that a considerable portion of students at the school of public service still plan to enter the private sector.But while students largely agree the School has a public service problem, they remain divided as to how to best combat it.Some say the school’s curricular focus no longer reflects its mission.“The focus in the school internally is not really public service,” says Muhamed H. Almaliky, a Student Government member.But others cite financial factors as the primary driver.“Students were almost being forced, I think, to go into the private sector because they had such a debt burden when they graduated,” says Douglas A. Levine, who graduated from HKS in 2008.Ellwood has focused extensively on increasing financial aid for HKS students, which he said in a February interview had doubled from an annual total of $11 million when his tenure began in 2004 to a projected $21 million this year.But according to Reitz, research conducted by the Dean’s Committee on Public Service found no strong connection between debt load and the sector a HKS student enters upon graduation. She adds that many students with greater than $100,000 in debt still enter the public sector.The availability of positions in government also affects student career choices according to McCarthy, who predicts an uptick in graduates entering the public sector this year due to what he dubbed “the Obama effect.”He says reduced availability of private sector jobs due to the economic crisis could also push students toward the public sector.Seizing on these economic and social forces, the Office of Career Advancement has stepped up its efforts to promote public service, according to Hessler, the Office’s director. Since last fall, it has brought in more career discussion panels and career fairs related to public service. Hessler says it has strengthened its connections with the World Bank, the United Nations, the U.S. government, and public sector consulting firms.Students have established a fall and spring “Day of Service” each semester, a day of volunteering in which Ellwood and some faculty have participated. And the Student Public Service Collaborative is pushing for more financial aid, although students say they realize this will be difficult in the current financial climate.But despite such changes, Ginsburg says substantial progress may be a long time coming.“The goal is not something you’re going to accomplish in one semester or one year,” he says. “It’s trying to establish something more systemic and fundamental than you can accomplish in just a few meetings.”—Staff writer Niha S.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard and MIT affiliates are suing the developers of their planned residential community for preventing them from moving into an apartment complex in Kendall Square. Though the affiliates have already submitted their deposits, they allege that the developers have failed to take the necessary steps towards reaching a final closing date. The plaintiffs—a dozen current and former faculty members who have put down initial deposits for units in 303 Third Street—are part of an independent project known as “University Residential Communities” that has sought to create a residential cooperative that would provide an academic setting in the Cambridge environment. The project originally limited rooms in the apartment complex to older affiliates of MIT and Harvard, but has since opened up to anyone seeking a condominium in that community.A few years ago, URC organizers entered into an agreement with the developers of the complex—a joint venture between Equity Residential and Extell Development Co.—in which 168 units of one of the two buildings would be sold through URC.  According to URC Executive Manager Bob Simha, the former director of planning at MIT, 38 people signed purchase and sale contracts and submitted their initial deposits. He said that they have received more than 60 other inquiries, but further contracts have been put on hold. In the past year, plaintiff and MIT President Emeritus Paul E. Gray said that the developers had altered their plans and that communication between the developers and URC has broken down. In a meeting with URC last November, the developers voiced their desire to convert the remaining condominiums into rentals, but has not met with the plaintiffs since, according to Gray. “Instead of coming out and saying, ‘look we’ve changed our mind,’they’ve ignored us since November,” said Gray. Equity Residential spokesman Marty McKenna declined to comment on the project because litigation is still pending.  With no word on the closing dates for the condominiums, those who have entered into purchase and sale contracts can neither move into their condominiums nor back out of the contracts without losing their deposits. Nevertheless, the twelve plaintiffs are still intent on moving into their apartments. Some had sold their former apartments under the assumption that the building would be completed in 2008.“They are hanging by their thumbs out there,” said Simha. “You can imagine how uncomfortable that can be.”As part of the suit, the developers are required to provide an explanation of the delay within 30 days of the April 13 filing, said the plaintiff’s attorney, Jeffrey J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a month ago, Nur Munir—a candidate for a masters degree at the Harvard Divinity School—stopped showing up to his classes. Last week, Baber Johansen, one of Munir’s professors, received an e-mail that explained his student’s month-long absence. The e-mail stated that Munir had been detained for the past month by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement at York County Prison in York, Pa., on charges of illegal residence in the United States after his application for political asylum was denied. Although Munir had applied for asylum in 1999 on the grounds of fear of persecution, he was denied and has been appealing the judgment since then.Professor Baber Johansen—who received the e-mail—said that it is unlikely that Munir will return.“There was very little hope for any legal help in this, and that the one thing one could hope is that somehow the immigration would let him finish his degree at Harvard,” he said. “It’s very, very uncertain.”Classmates were surprised when they heard about Munir’s detention. “In a sense it’s even more shocking just because you would never expect someone to go after someone who’s a scholar at this University and who is obviously working toward enriching society,” said Na’eel A. Cajee ’10, who is taking a History of Science seminar with Munir. “To deport them seems ludicrous.”According to the official case report, Munir, who is of Indonesian descent, leaked a recording of a speech of then-President of Indonesia Suharto to the Indonesian Embassy in Egypt, in which Suharto expressed a willingness to step down from power. The speech was then published in Kompas, a prominent Indonesian newspaper.  Fearful of retaliation, Munir fled to United States in June 1998 and eventually enrolled at Harvard Divinity School. In a letter to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Johansen wrote, “[Munir] was a very active member of our class who never missed a session, always engaged in the class discussions, and took a clear reformist position in his detailed papers.”Early last week, Johansen received an e-mail from Kristine C. Mehok, a pro bono lawyer at Nationalities Service Center, inquiring whether Munir would be able to conduct distance learning from Indonesia in order to finish his degree since he can no longer stay in the United States. According to Jean Han of Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, Munir’s lawyer has filed a deferred action application so that Munir can finish his degree at Harvard.His fellow students have also written letters to the immigration service pleading for his case. The letters are to be sent out today.

Courtside Celtics tickets and luxurious weekend getaways were on the auction block at the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub last night for the Phillips Brooks House Association’s sixth annual Auction to Benefit the Summer Urban Program (SUP).The event featured a silent auction as well as a live auction conducted by guest auctioneer and musician Livingston Taylor—the brother of singer-songwriter James Taylor. With big ticket items including trips to San Francisco and tickets to games at Fenway garnering high bids, PBHA received considerable funding for its community service programs. The night’s curator, PBHA Events and Fundraising Officer Sophia C. Sakellariadis ’11, described the annual auction as “the biggest fundraising event supporting SUP, and important not only as a fundraiser but also as a nice way for the community to celebrate SUP and get a lot of alumni reinvolved with the program.”The Summer Urban Program has been serving over 800 youths in the greater Boston area each year for over 25 years through 10 community-based summer camps. Each camp is run by a student director and is staffed entirely by students from Harvard and other Boston-area schools.“Each of the programs is important within its community. There’s an element of social change in meeting these kids’ needs and helping the members of these communities empower themselves by being allies to the residents,” said former Mission Hill SUP Director David V. Jenkins ’03. “That is how you build a community’s power.”A sense of continued presence in the communities was the theme of the night. In her opening remarks, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds praised PBHA for being a model for continued public service in the nation at large.Awards were also presented to City Councilor Sam Yoon and Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff for their consistent dedication to service in the Boston and Cambridge areas.Former camper and current SUP Director Nehemie Bernard, who is also a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, described her experience as an example of the continuity fostered by the program.  “This past summer when I was having a bad day my campers drew a poster with my picture on it and included things I had been telling them all summer,” she said. “Knowing that the campers appreciated me being there, it made me dedicated to giving back. That is who I am.”

A spreading epidemic of swine flu continues to shake up the public health landscape as the number of cases in the United States ballooned to 69 yesterday. The outbreak has already infected 1,600 citizens and claimed 150 lives in Mexico, the country where it originated.Effects of the potential pandemic could be felt across the U.S. as President Obama requested $1.5 billion from Congress to combat the virus, and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency after the virus infected more than 10 Californians and is currently being investigated for any role in the deaths of two others.As the death toll continues to rise, public health officials are not optimistic about the illness’s decline anytime soon. “It’s likely that we’re just seeing the beginning of an epidemic. Right now it’s hard to say how extensive it’s going to be,” said George R. Seage, associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. The flu has already been detected in  Kansas, Texas, California and New York. And Massachusetts is on high alert while two children in Lowell, Mass., await test results for the illness after returning from a trip to Mexico.The virus may not have infected Boston yet, but Harvard students are already feeling its effects. For Francisco J. Marmolejo ’12, a sustained outbreak could mean not returning to his hometown of San Luis Potosí in Mexico for the summer. “There is a sort of fear [in San Luis]. People are afraid to go out. Everyone wears face masks,” said Marmolejo, describing phone calls from friends and family back home. “I was thinking about going back, but now I’m just going to see how it evolves from here.”According to the World Health Organization, swine flu is a strain of the influenza virus found in pigs that is rarely transferable to humans. But the recent outbreak is believed to be a mutated form of the strain which has contributed to its high degree of contagiousness among humans. The flu’s symptoms are similar to the standard influenza virus—including sore throat, fever, coughing, body aches, and chills.While Harvard students may not be wearing face masks—a common practice in several international cities—school health officials are clear about how to prevent an outbreak on campus. “I think the idea here is to be vigilant. The most important thing is to practice good hygiene” said David S. Rosenthal ’59, director of Harvard University Health Services (UHS). “I would recommend that students wash their hands, use your Purell dispensers, etc. It’s basically a huge hygiene message.”A vigorous hand washing campaign isn’t the only tactic Harvard is using for its students to combat the epidemic. UHS issued a written announcement on its Web site yesterday that provided helpful hints for students to stay healthy. The bulletin also included information to dispel false rumors regarding swine flu, such as the notion that eating pork products could lead to an infection.In the event that a case of the virus does arise on campus, Rosenthal said he is confident in UHS preparations. “The University had been working on an emergency plan for some time. We have a pandemic flu plan, a crisis team is in place, and local emergency authorities standing by,” he said. “We’ll just have to wait and see how it plays out.”

Young alumni received an e-mail last Friday from the Recent Graduates Committee encouraging them to use career resources, including the Office of Career Services and Crimson Compass, during the current economic downturn. The e-mail highlighted the newly created Crimson Careers database, which lists jobs available for both students and alumni. The efforts generated immediate results. The database received a surge of 120 new users registering on the day that the e-mail was sent out, according to OCS Associate Director Susan M. Vacca.“As a committee we saw the need to help our fellow alumni/ae during this challenging economic time,” Kelly A. O’Shea ’02 and Joshua M. Mendelsohn ’05, co-chairs of the Recent Graduates Committee, wrote in an e-mail statement. The e-mail from the Recent Graduates Committee—which was crafted with the help of OCS—was intended to encourage recent graduates to tap into OCS’s resources. Vacca said that alumni have not contacted OCS with more frequency this year than in past years, despite the economic downturn. She attributed this lack of change to graduates using personal networks rather than OCS resources, adding that information is available online so alumni do not need to call OCS for help.“If we have done our job well, we’ve taught them how to develop opportunities for themselves,” Vacca said.Reva P. Minkoff ’08, a former Crimson staff director, used OCS resources after graduation, but said that she did not “feel like they were particularly helpful.”“They tried, and their heart is in the right place,” she said. OCS is useful for alumni in Boston and New York but is less effective for graduates outside those areas who are uninterested in going to graduate school, Minkoff said.Other recent alumni agreed. “They’re certainly great for an educational perspective like learning about careers, probably less helpful in actually  getting a job, which is what we want at this point,” added Carrie E. Andersen ’08.But Minkoff—who is on the Recent Graduates Committee and helped craft the e-mail—did emphasize the importance of the Harvard name and alumni networks. Minkoff, who switched jobs, said she hated her old job but loves her new one as the editor-in-chief of a start-up Web site.Vacca said the current economic recession also has some benefits, forcing graduates to consider jobs outside traditional industries like finance or consulting and think more broadly about career options.—Staff writer Danielle J.

Saying men on campus can to do more to advocate against rape, gender violence, and sexual harassment, Harvard Men Against Rape yesterday launched a Web site—MenSpeakUp.org—in the hopes of creating a male community to fight gender inequality. The Web site—unveiled at a showcase yesterday—includes blogs, video, and resources for those affected by sexual harassment.“We wanted to give something that is for gender equality and for change and for something positive,” said Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, who helped launch the site. “This is an issue that affects everyone, and unfortunately Harvard is no exception.”The site’s sponsors said they hoped focusing their message on men would be effective at preventing sexual harassment by changing what they say is widespread male apathy toward the issue.“Usually guys will say that other guys are apathetic to the issue of rape, this is a woman’s issue,” Van Vuuren said. “The other issue is people don’t believe the facts. They say, ‘Really? One in five girls has been sexually assaulted? But I have ten girl friends and none of them have been raped.’”Sarah Rankin, director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, echoed those sentiments at the showcase. “Men will hear things differently from other men than women,” she said. “When men are welcomed into the conversation, we can see what kind of impact this outreach will have on the issue of gender equality.”The Web site also comes as part of a recent resurgence for Harvard Men Against Rape, which was founded in 2003 but only recently became more visible on campus.Speakers at the event said they would push for this trend to continue by encouraging the Harvard community to use the Web site, and contribute to its blogs.“I think a big hope for MenSpeakUp.org is that it provides a resource for men to care,” said Gordon W. Braxton, a freshman proctor and a prevention specialist at OSAPR who worked on the site. “I think a lot of people care behind closed doors but they don’t have social validation to care publicly. I hope the site can remedy some of that.”The site’s founders also said they hoped to harness Harvard’s visibility to promote their message nationwide.“Because if I am the 14-year-old guy in Nebraska, I will see that these cool guys at Harvard care about this,” said Van Vuuren. “So if I care about this, it won’t make me any less cool.”

Harvard Square’s­ recession-pinched businesses are now targeting students through a new e-mail list launched by student-run business Unofficial Tours. The e-mail list, which went live on Monday at www.harvardbargainblast.com, is a biweekly newsletter touting exclusive offers for Harvard students from businesses like the bar Tommy Doyle’s and the local hamburger chain b.good.As extra incentive to sign up, the first 100 people to subscribe will receive automatic gift certificates to b.good, burrito chain Qdoba, or the restaurant Grendel’s Den. All who sign up are entered to win prizes ranging from Red Sox tickets to an iPod touch, set to be raffled off May 2 by the Harvard T stop.The site is an unorthodox venture for Unofficial Tours, which is known for running cheeky campus tours year-round and for competing with the official Crimson Key Society tours for tourist attention. President and founder Daniel Andrew ’07 cited the company’s success in driving up tourist foot traffic at Square businesses as reason to believe their foray into advertising will be successful. “Business owners are really hurting for business, locals aren’t shopping the way they did, and students are certainly feeling the pinch,” Andrew said.With a majority of students on financial aid, Director of Corporate Operations Eduard W. Bogel ’11 said that the student-focused discounts were well-targeted.One feature of the e-mail list will be student liaisons to work with businesses to create particularly student-friendly discounts. “Honestly, you’d be surprised at how many businesses don’t know what’s going on with students,” Andrew said. The project has been in the works since last summer, before the recession deepened.“When the stock market went down, it’s given even more value to this original idea,” Andrew said. Some Square businesses have suffered visibly. Z Square restaurant and bar shut its doors after financial and management difficulties in January. But the recession has not prevented several new establishments from opening in recent months, including Sweet, a cupcake store that opened yesterday, and Tory Row, a European-style cafe. Dustin L. Frankus, the manager of Grendel’s Den, said that business has been looking up and that while they are participating in the promotion, the restaurant hasn’t had trouble attracting students. “Harvard students are kind of the bread and butter here,” he said.—Staff writer Lingbo Li can be reached at lingboli@fas.harvard.edu

The Harvard Graduate School of Education will launch a Twitter feed dubbed “hgse_live” that will cover the Dalai Lama’s talk at Memorial Church this Thursday. The GSE plans to continue using the account for other talks in the future in an attempt to share its on-the-ground perspective of events pertinent to the study of education as the events unfold. Michael Rodman, the director of communications for the GSE, said that he was optimistic about the potential of the new feed. “It’s a great new way to use an interactive technology to reach out to people who are interested in learning more about what we do here,” he said.According to Rodman, graduate or post-doctoral students at the GSE will be responsible for covering events and conveying the information over the feed.Twitter is a free service that allows users to upload snippets of text, or “tweets,” from a computer or mobile device and send them to interested parties. Subscribers can choose to receive the updates via text message on their mobile phones or to be notified by e-mail.The new account is GSE’s second twitter feed. The first one—named “hgse”— launched in early February and is used to report general school news and information about upcoming events. Subscribers occupy a broad range within the education community—from Harvard affiliates to charter schools and other universities. According to Rodman, school administrators developed the idea for a new live-feed when GSE student Hanna Rodriguez-Farrar provided live commentary over the main feed during a panel discussion on Boston charter schools earlier this month.The first feed will link interested followers to the live one whenever coverage of an event begins. “We felt the need to separate the two for subscribers who didn’t want that much content,” Rodman said.Twitter feeds are becoming more popular among educational institutions. Already Harvard Business School,  Harvard Kennedy School, and Harvard Medical School are members of the Twitter community. Their feeds provide a viable new avenue for the quick dissemination of information. On Thursday, “hgse_live” will further this broader initiative.“It’s what we’re about here, making sure our work gets into the hands of people who can implement it,” said Rodman.

For those Americans and Harvardians mired in the gloom of the global financial crisis, a top Serbian politician offered some much-needed optimism at Harvard yesterday.Amid a global downturn, Serbia has fared comparatively well, and Deputy Prime Minister Mladjan Dinkic, also the Minister for Economy and Regional Development, said the United States needed to follow the small Balkan nation’s lead to revive its economy.Dinkic, who said he was in the country in part to discuss economic issues with a group of U.S. senators, gave suggestions for U.S. recovery to a packed room of students, academics, and professionals at the Kennedy School yesterday.Dinkic said the United States has struggled so far because it has neither allowed failing financial institutions to fall nor given rescued banks enough money to jump start lending.Dinkic pointed to his own experience as governor of Serbia’s Central Bank, where he said he allowed four major banks to fold in one day in 2002 because the Serbian people had no confidence in them.Still, Dinkic expressed support for the Obama administration’s stimulus efforts, cautioning that the American public must be patient.“They are rebuilding confidence, but lending must start to move,” Dinkic said.Throughout his lecture, Dinkic spoke with a sustained optimism. At one point a self-conscious laugh about the controversial former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic’s “irresponsible spending” drew a ripple of chuckles from the room.Dinkic’s cheery attitude also appeared to help him avoid controversy on issues such as Serbia’s trade agreement with Iran—which he explained by saying that nation “pays everything promptly”—and tension surrounding Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia last year and is recognized as independent by major nations including Great Britain, France, and the United States, though not Serbia,Dinkic’s upbeat message pleased the lecture’s organizers.“We were happy to be able to sponsor someone with a message of proactive measures for the future,” said Ilyana M. Sawka, program coordinator of the Kennedy School’s Kokkalis Program, which runs initiatives for southeast and east-central Europe.Boston-area professionals said they appreciated Dinkic’s frankness.“It’s impressive that he is as optimistic as he is, focusing on the future,” said Kristen Rupert, executive director of the Massachusetts Alliance for International Business. Yet some left the lecture frustrated by Dinkic’s vagueness.Mira Popopic, who said she was a University of Massachusetts Ph.D., challenged Dinkic’s call for Serbian experts to return to the country, saying she would move home “tomorrow” if the country had a job for her.But Dinkic avoided answering her question, instead speaking at length about handling adversity in the job market and remaining hopeful.Still, Dinkic’s message was largely appreciated.“It’s a tough economic situation so it’s difficult to do things on a larger scale,” Rupert said in response to the awkward exchange. “But it’s important to plant the seeds.”For his part, Dinkic said he was happy to share his time and opinions with the United States, which he called the key to solving the global crisis, and the Harvard community in particular.“The name of Harvard University is synonymous with quality,” Dinkic said. “It has a strong role in U.S. politics as it produces the important politicians.”—Staff writer Alexander R.

As if Harvard baseball’s last game were meant to be a comprehensive review of the team’s season, yesterday’s matchup against Northeastern at O’Donnell Field featured the best and worst that the Crimson’s 2009 campaign had to offer.There were the all too familiar pitching and defensive breakdowns that prevented Harvard from positioning itself among the Ivy League’s elite and contending for the Rolfe Division title this season.But there were also the offensive outbursts and late-inning rallies that pulled the Crimson out of the Rolfe basement and marked it as a team that could never be counted out of a game, no matter how daunting of a deficit it faced.Yesterday, Harvard’s redeeming qualities were just enough to compensate for its most noticeable flaws and the Crimson (13-28, 10-10 Ivy) overcame an early 7-0 deficit to eventually topple the Huskies (22-16, 8-7 CAA) by a score of 16-13.“The game was pretty typical of our season,” Harvard captain Harry Douglas said. “It turned into a slugfest. But that’s the way we’ve been all year, coming back from behind.”The Crimson had been doomed by the “big inning” throughout the season, and when Northeastern put seven runs on the board in the first frame off senior starting pitcher Adam Cole, it appeared Harvard’s day was done just as it had started.But down, 9-4, in the bottom of the seventh, the Crimson revealed that it had been saving up a big inning of its own all along. The squad exploded for 10 runs in the frame, coming through with timely hits and taking advantage of the Huskies’ miscues.The Harvard eruption began with back-to-back doubles off the bats of freshman Marcus Way and senior Matt Rogers. After senior Taylor Meehan walked, Douglas moved the runners over to second and third with a groundball and senior Tom Stack-Babich drove Rogers home with a single to center field. Northeastern pitcher Tyler Thornton hit rookie J.T. Tomes to load the bases and then walked senior catcher Jared Wortzman to make the score 9-7. Stack-Babich reached home on a wild pitch, bringing up sophomore Dillon O’Neill with one out and a pair of runners on base.O’Neill smoked a two-run triple to give Harvard the lead and the comeback was completed. The Crimson tacked another four runs in the frame to go up, 14-9.“We haven’t had one of those [types of innings] in a long time,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “We’ll have to get one of those scoreboards that’s got parentheses on it,” he quipped. “Usually that’s only for the other team.”The Crimson almost squandered its seventh-inning rally in the top of the eighth, when senior reliever Ryan Watson’s initially solid pitching was negated by a pair of errors. The lefty then began to struggle with his control, allowing the Huskies to pull within two. Sophomore Dan Berardo replaced Watson, allowing another run to score on a wild pitch before buckling down to get the final out of the inning with Harvard still up, 14-13.The Crimson added two insurance runs in the bottom of the eighth, although they proved unnecessary. Stack-Babich, who assumed the closer’s role late in the season in addition to his normal duties in right field, took the mound for one last time. The senior ended his Harvard career in style, whiffing all three Northeastern batters he faced to nail down the save and give his team the victory.“Stack came in and he was dealing in the ninth,” Walsh said. “He’s relaxed whether it’s with a one-run lead or a three-run lead. He really has been a present surprise for us with that arm, closing out some ballgames.”The Crimson may not have been in a position to win at all had it not been for a gutsy relief outing by sophomore pitcher Anthony Nutter. Coming in to stop the bleeding in the top of the first with his team down by seven, Nutter did what was required of him and more. The righty threw 6 1/3 stellar innings of four-hit ball, giving up just two runs on a homer by the Huskies’ Ryan Kemp in the top of the third and keeping Harvard within reach.“It brought back memories of last year when he was keeping guys off base,” Walsh said. “He was mixing—his fastball was tough because he was getting breaking balls over.”But while the sophomore Nutter kept the Crimson alive, the day belonged to the team’s seniors, who took the field in Harvard uniforms for the last time. Walsh got all eight of his seniors into the game, filling the top six slots of his starting lineup with fourth-years and sending both Cole and Watson to the mound.Douglas, Meehan, Rogers and Stack-Babich—arguably the team’s four best hitters this season—all drove in runs in their final appearances.Jon Roberts, who served as an outfielder and pinch hitter for the Crimson during the year, made the most of his lone at-bat, going yard in the bottom of the fourth with a shot over the left-field wall.And then there was Wortzman. Game action has been scarce for the Stoughton, Mass. native, a walk-on who has spent his time on the team catching bullpen sessions and warming up pitchers between innings. But Wortzman has taken advantage of his rare ventures out onto the field, and yesterday was no different. He went two-for-three at the plate with an RBI and a run scored and threw out a runner trying to steal second base in the top of the seventh.“He’s been one of those guys behind the scenes,” Walsh said of Wortzman. “It’s nice to know that if your catchers get hurt you have a guy who can step in there and play. What I’d like to see—and I know he’s got a big career in medicine planned—I think he’d make a terrific coach.”For all the seniors, it was the end of a tough season, but also of a career, and the Crimson’s elder statesmen took time to reflect after the game.“We got off to a slow start, but we battled,” Stack-Babich said. “It’s been a great four years. I want to thank Coach Walsh for giving me the chance to play here.”“It’s been fantastic,” Douglas added. “I’m definitely going to miss it.”—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard took to the field for its Spring Game on Saturday night, the Crimson faithful got its first look at a team that is coming off the end of an era or two. Saturday’s scrimmage marked the first time that Harvard took the field without members of a pair of incredibly influential and successful classes of players. On the one hand, the absence of fifth-year players like Chris Pizzotti, Liam O’Hagan, Desmond Bryant, and several offensive linemen—guys who were the last holdovers from the 2004 squad that went 10-0—was most obvious, as the biggest questions on this year’s team lie at quarterback and at defensive end. There’s no question that group was talented—Pizzotti signed with the New York Jets after the draft, and Bryant with the Oakland Raiders. Less noticeable—oddly—was the absence of one of the best recruiting classes in Crimson history, a batch of freshmen who entered in the fall of 2005 after being recruited during the magical 2004 campaign. It leaves as a senior class that went 31-9, won back-to-back Ivy titles in 2007 and 2008, and came within a missed extra point of an undefeated 2008 campaign. It produced no fewer than seven All-Ivy selections this season, including three First Team defensive selections in Eric Schultz, Glenn Dorris, and Andrew Berry. There are a few holdovers, to be sure, some whom will play huge roles this season. Captain Carl Ehrlich is back for a fifth year, along with Sean Hayes—a promising linebacker who started six games his sophomore season before an injury took him off the field. Fortunately for the Crimson, the losses of that 2005 class will be less noticeable thanks to a crop of talented upperclassmen waiting in the wings—players like rising seniors Nick Hasselberg, Jon Takamura, J.B. Monu, and Connor Murphy, who will join Hayes in replacing the departed senior starters from the linebacking corps. But, ironically, the Crimson’s attempt to find a solution to its most pressing current problem—the quarterback spot—may well involve looking backwards, to a player who was once a blockmate of Pizzotti and a member of the 2004 squad. With a pair of juniors, Matt Simpson and Collier Winters, struggling somewhat in the Spring Game, the best case for Harvard may be the return of Andrew Hatch, the well-traveled former Crimson quarterback who started two games for Louisiana State last season. Hatch is attempting to get back to Cambridge to finish his career in a Harvard uniform, although the jury is still out on his return. “We’re okay with the guys we have,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “There’s usually a small chance that when you transfer and then come back to the same school, I’m sure someone’s been made eligible for it, but most times it never happens.” In all likelihood, Winters and Simpson will get one year to prove themselves, as NCAA transfer rules will likely prevent any immediate return by Hatch. That would set up an entertaining battle for the starting spot in 2010, when Hatch, Winters, and Simpson could all be in the mix for the starting job as seniors. The legacy of the 2004 team, quite simply the greatest team in the modern era of Harvard football, will live on with Hatch’s return. In a way, it will be that the Crimson has traveled full circle with an era of extremely successful players. A series of guys who practiced with Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, the greatest Harvard quarterback of the modern era, continue to carry his legacy—O’Hagan, Pizzotti, and now, perhaps, Hatch. —Staff writer Brad Hinshelwood can be reached at bhinshel@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday’s announcement that senior quarterback Chris Pizzotti and senior defensive end Desmond Bryant were going to the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders, respectively, as undrafted free agent signees got me thinking about the current state of the Ivy League in the NFL.Now don’t get me wrong, I’m not delusional. I know Ivy League football pales in comparison to top tier conferences, but something has to be said for the fact that the Ivies are the only conference in the football championship subdivision (FCS) to have a player from each school in the NFL. So I think it only fitting to see how our Ancient Eight predecessors are faring in the big leagues.By my count, there are roughly 19 Ivy League grads (21, now counting Pizzotti and Bryant), who have had some NFL activity in recent years.The most notable of those would probably be Harvard’s own Matt Birk ’98, who had a long career at center for his hometown Minnesota Vikings, amassing six Pro Bowl selections. As an unrestricted free agent this offseason, Birk was snatched up by the Baltimore Ravens to the tune of three years, $12 million—six of which are guaranteed. Not too shabby.The team with the most Ivy Leaguers is undoubtedly the New York Giants. Their 2007 roster that upset the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII included Cornell’s Kevin Boothe, Brown’s Zak DeOssie, and Penn’s Jim Finn. DeOssie was responsible for tackling New England’s Laurence Maroney at the Patriot 26 on the final kickoff of the game. With just 29 seconds remaining, 74 yards is a long way to go.Both Boothe and DeOssie are still on the roster, while Finn is navigating the free agent market. The Giants have since added Columbia’s Steve Cargile to backup Kenny Phillips at safety.Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 was somewhat of a one-hit wonder. In his debut with the Rams, Fitzpatrick came in after Jamie Martin got injured in the second quarter and took the Rams from a 24-3 halftime deficit to a 33-27 win in overtime while throwing for 310 yards and three touchdowns.Since, Fitzpatrick has been serving primarily in a backup role with the Rams, then the Bengals, and now the Bills. Accuracy has been his Achilles’ heel; last season Fitzpatrick passed for 1905 yards and eight touchdowns, but also had nine interceptions. It’s never a good sign when you have more interceptions than touchdowns.Elsewhere around the NFL, there is a smattering of players with Ivy League roots. In St. Louis, Columbia’s Jeff Otis is a deep backup for Rams quarterback Marc Bulger.Dartmouth’s Casey Cramer is a third string fullback in his third stint with the Titans, last I checked.In Arizona, Brown’s Sean Morey is holding things down for the Cardinals special teams. He got a Pro Bowl selection this past season as a “special teamer.” In 2007, he also got a few receptions at wideout—eight, to be exact, for 131 yards.Fellow Bear Paul Raymond just got signed as a wide receiver for the Jets in January, so if Pizzotti gets any snaps, he can look for his former rival downfield.Prinecton’s Jonathan Drekker is listed on the Steelers active roster, but he doesn’t yet have a place in their depth chart, while across the country, fellow Tiger Zak Keasey is playing backup to the 49ers Moran Norris at fullback. Dennis Norman, also a Princeton grad, is a backup center for the Jaguars.The only Elis on the NFL radar are Eric Johnson and Nate Lawrie. Johnson was released by the Saints last year before the start of the season to join Lawrie floating in the free agent pool.Penn’s Ben Noll is on the practice squad for the Detroit Lions, while Brown alum Chas Gessner, after getting released by the Seahawks, signed with the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League, where he scored three touchdowns in their playoff loss to the Cleveland Gladiators.Princeton’s Ross Tucker is, in my opinion, the consummate Ivy Leaguer. After getting cut by the Redskins, Tucker took up journalism and writes occasionally for SI.com. He also sometimes hosts for Sirius NFL Radio, and he co-founded a high school recruiting website called GoBig Recruiting. If it’s not football, it’s a business career focused around football.Sadly absent from any NFL rosters is Clifton Dawson ’07, who was released by the Colts in March after being shuffled between Indianapolis and the Bengals.So as Pizzotti and Bryant embark on the road from the Ivy League to the NFL, they should know that the journey is no easy task. There is a long trail of Ivy grads who couldn’t make the cut. But that’s not to say that it can’t be done.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

The VOID is that empty time between 5am and 8am every night where there’s no one on gchat, no sound but your roommate’s blissful snoring, and nothing to think about besides the work you’re not getting done.  But you’re not alone, FlyBy is here to guide you through.
Bitchin about the heat? Not getting the extension you sucked up to the TF all semester for?  Your prefrosh's neediness burn through your entire weekend?  Awww, pobrecitas! FlyBy is so sorry...but there are NO EXCUSES in the VOID.  Just do it. Giving up isn't an option...unless you want that transcript to look a little like this box score (can you tell FlyBy likes sportz? Too much of this video is true for comfort...).
At this point you're deep now, and as always FlyBy is here to guide you to the sunrise and beyond.  Something sweet: quite possibly the funnest thing FlyBy has ran into on the web in quite some time...please, experiment--a non-sweet combination just isn't possible with this thing.  Also, pics of the weird/creepy items to be found at the Neverland Ranch auction (still gotta love the music, though)
But for some deadly things: a few of FlyBy's favorite uni-themed tumblrs: Songsyouusedtolove, cutethingsfallingasleep, Namethatfilm, and Whitewhine.
Hopefully, at least one will tickle your fancy.

The 2009 Harvard baseball team wrapped up its season yesterday with a 16-13 win, capping a 13-28 campaign, including a 10-10 Ivy League effort that demonstrated marked improvement from last year. But an aspect of the season that didn't improve? That would be the pitching, which boasted a less than stellar ERA of 8.00 (versus 6.20 last year).
As the Crimson shelves its gloves and bats for the summer and thinks back on the year that was, players may cringe a bit when San Diego State senior Stephen Strasburg, who has struck out 23 in one game, one-hit the Netherlands National Team in his first Olympic start, and has been called the greatest prospect ever by Buster Olney,  gets selected first overall during the MLB amateur draft in June. To find out why, read on after the jump.
Strasburg represents an elite breed of college pitcher, with a fastball topping out at an eye-popping 103mph to go along with a nasty 93-94mph slider and devastating curveball. The 20-year old stud might have helped lower Harvard's ERA, considering the former Olympian posted a 1.57 ERA last season and has continued to dominate, going 9-0 so far this year with a 1.54 ERA and 135 strikeouts in just 70.1 innings. Compare that to the Crimson's entire 2009 staff, which logged 211 K's in 332.0 innings.  Kids like this make FlyBy want to indulge it's sports-fetish and become the next Scott Boras.
You might be wondering why Harvard fans should care. Take any all-star and add his stats to your roster fantasy-style and things should be looking up, right?. But trust, we have reason to sigh. Casually mentioned on popular sportsblog Deadspin, it appears Strasburg was recruited by the Crimson when he remained a relatively unheralded prospect coming out of high school. A quick google search provides some confirmation that the claim is true.
It is unclear how seriously Strasburg considered making the trip east, especially since both of his parents attended SDSU, but every time the 6'4", 220 pound righty pumps his fastball by a hapless fellow rookie this summer, people in a Crimson uniform will ponder the what-ifs.

Finally, some nice weather. Out come the dresses, out comes the fun...out come the balls. It's time for us Harvard kids to get down as only the most prestigious can: house formals. FlyBy has your guide to the balls.
We start with a handful of nice balls.  Nothing spectacular, but these balls are certainly worth fooling around with if you get the chance.  With this many balls, no one's going to get the shaft.
Monday, May 4th
The grouping of balls on Monday form a nice three-piece set—they're going to be tough to juggle.
Winthrop hosts their annual Arbella Ball in Gore Courtyard, which should be nice, especially if the weather is warm.  Sometimes it's the hot and sweaty balls that are the most fun.  Ladies, we all know things can get a little hairy if you date sweats through his tuxedo, but if you just let it all hang out, there'll be nothing to worry about.
Cabot and Pfoho host a joint formal in Moors Terrace (FlyBy hasn’t been to the Quad since freshman year, but we assume that’s in the Quad, too). We support a good ball pairing.
Currier shows them all up, though: THEY'RE ON A BOAT! The mermaid would definitely like to get on this ball.
More balls of all shapes and sizes after the jump.
Tuesday, May 5th
The HoCo chairs keep a fairly tight grip on these balls—it's tough to get in, especially if it's your first time.
Kirkland  hosts their standard incestuous spring bash in the House courtyard. We hear they only like to have a ball with each other.
Adams hosts in the only place they would ever want to—Adams.  There will be some outdoor space allowing this ball to get a little ventilation.
Now we're approaching the finest set of balls.  These two balls are so revered that other houses risk eternal shame if they dare show their stuff on the same night as these awe-inspiring behemoths.  FlyBy's mouth waters just thinking about them.
Wednesday, May 6th
Nary a house dares pit their formal against Eliot’s Fête.  Unfortunately, tight security means that unless you can find a date in Eliot, you will not get a chance to experience the sights, smells and tastes of this majestic ball.
Thursday, May 7th
The always classy Bacchanalia of Lowell House comes Thursday. FlyBy heard a disturbing rumor that there will be no living statues this year.  The flaccid endowment has even touched the balls, it seems.  We all lose.
Back to normal-sized balls for the last couple of nights.  At this point, people are starting to zone in on papers and finals—balls, however, can still be fun, even if not given one's undivided attention.
Friday, May 8th
Friday brings us two small balls that probably no one wants to see.
Remember Leverett ALMOST holding an awesome formal?  Yeah, well, we are talking about Leverett here. Maybe next year. Or the year after that…This recession has really busted what could've been a good ball.  Casablanca will be the theme.
Dunster is hosting in their courtyard this night as well.  The theme of this year's formal is Beltane, which appears to be some Gaelic festival.  It precipitated this disclaimer from the Dunster HoCo yesterday:
Don't get too excited.
Saturday, May 9th
Mather Formal in Mather Courtyard. Should be a loud, schweaty affair.  Some Mather headbands will give this ball a different flavor.
Sunday, May 10th
And last but not least, Quincy’s formal. There's no beating the location of this ball, as it's held at The Estate in Boston. However, our guess is that this ball is most likely to have some type of infectious disease...Paris loves to frequent this place.
