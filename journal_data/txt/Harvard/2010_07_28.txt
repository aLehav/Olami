After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A male student at the College was robbed by three unidentified men as he was walking along Memorial Drive near Ash Street Monday night, according to a crime alert released by the Harvard University Police Department.
The victim told the police that he was walking along Memorial Drive when three suspects approached him and asked for the time. When the student glanced down at his watch, he was hit in the head with a fist and fell to the ground. The three men then punched and kicked the student repeatedly.
The offenders demanded the student's wallet, which was immediately surrendered. The trio then fled the area, and the student was transported to Mt. Auburn Hospital to be treated for minor injuries, according to the alert.
Because the crime took place off the Harvard campus, the Massachusetts State Police has taken the reins of the investigation.
State Police Trooper Wes Wanagel, the lead investigator of the case, did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
American history concentrators will tell you that the Gold Rush happened in the late 1800s in California. Fans of Ivy League crew would give you a different answer: Brest, Belarus in 2010. By the time the 2010 World Rowing Under 23 Championships concluded last Sunday, six rowers from four different Ancient Eight schools had struck gold at the four-day competition. But luckily for this Back Page correspondent and all the loyal readers out there, this edition of Around the Water Cooler will touch on more than just crew. We have some men’s lacrosse news, and—of course—some Ivy League basketball updates.
But first, a quiz. Knowing that only four of eight Ivy League schools had rowers win gold medals this past weekend in Belarus, which school could you safely bet returned empty handed? If you guessed Brown, you are—surprisingly—wrong. Recent Brown graduate Hannah Malvin rowed in the women’s fours for the United State’s boat that beat out Australia by just less than three seconds.
The other three schools are pretty predictable: Princeton, Harvard/Radcliffe, and Yale were the other schools that sent gold medal winners to Eastern Europe. Princeton led the way with three different gold medal winners: Michaela Strand, Sara Hendershot, and Ariel Frost.
Yale rower Taylor Ritzel and Radcliffe heavyweight Olivia Coffey set aside their collegiate rivalry for exactly six minutes and 31.97 seconds to win one for their country. Ritzel and Coffey teamed up in the US women’s eight boat (which was coxed by Princeton’s Frost) that defeated New Zealand by 4.51 seconds to take the gold. Also representing Harvard was lightweight freshman coach Lina Muri, who led three boats to gold medals—the pair, four, and eight.
Whew, that was more than enough crew for one lifetime. Keeping up with the theme of winning gold medals, Penn men’s assistant lacrosse coach dusted off his lacrosse stick to play goalie for the United States at the 2010 Federation of International Lacrosse World Championship played in Manchester, England. The U.S. defeated Canada 12-10 in the final behind a 15-save performance from Dougherty.
In hoops news, the Cornell men’s basketball team’s “tentatively projected 2010-2011 non-conference schedule” was released by the Cornell Basketball Blog. The Big Red is expected to square off against such elite opponents as Seton Hall, Syracuse, and Minnesota. The Harvard men’s basketball team is expected to take on at least four opponents from the power six conferences. The Crimson will host Colorado and visit Connecticut, Michigan, and Boston College. Also on the schedule for Harvard are the Atlantic 10’s Fordham and George Washington and the Colonial Athletic Association’s George Mason.
