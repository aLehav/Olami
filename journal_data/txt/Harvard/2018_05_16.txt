After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Meet Bertrand (Mathieu Amalric): He’s been unemployed for two years, sprinkles his antidepressants in his cereal, and will not be “playing Candy Crush on the couch,” though his daughter says otherwise. When he tries and fails yet again to acquire a new job—predictably, after spending a couple hours playing Candy Crush on the couch—he makes an odd decision that he hopes will take his life in an entirely new direction by joining a male synchronized swim team. “Can you swim?” asks the team’s coach, Delphine (Virginie Efira). “I don’t know,” he says. Despite his utter lack of qualification, he makes it onto a team of several other equally unqualified men. Together, they pool together in Gilles Lellouche’s latest feature film, “Le Grand Bain” (“Sink Or Swim”), a gratifying comedy that finds its heart in the midst of several midlife crises.
Part synchronized swimming training practice, part group therapy session, the group of aging, out of shape, and hopelessly dedicated men make an unexpectedly supportive and uproarious—if not unoriginal—party. When Bertrand initially joins them, he finds comfort knowing he is free to be the loser he feels he has become, but he’s not the only one with problems. “You think you have a monopoly on depression? It’s got all of us,” says Laurent (Guillaume Canet), the group’s brooding, angry cynic.
The Seven Dwarves to Delphine’s brutal Snow White, four of whom are at the center of the film, the men feed into stereotypes that don’t fall into tropic caricatures thanks to their mostly nuanced acting. First, we have Laurent, who takes his own internalized pain—he hasn’t visited his senile mother in a while, likely because she’ll reach a breaking point in her interaction with him where she’ll goes from an appreciative to hateful, abusive mother—out on his family, the effects of which manifest in his son’s developing stammer. Next is charismatic Marcus (Benoît Poelvoorde) who, with entrepreneurial aspirations “like Michael Douglas in ‘Wall Street,’" can talk himself out of almost anything, except for the bankruptcy he will yet again have to file for in order to save his dying pool-selling business. Quiet lunchman Simon (Jean-Hugues Anglade) is still trying to follow his impossible dream of becoming a rockstar, despite the discouragement everyone—especially his daughter—gives him. Thierry (Philippe Katerine) is the caring clown, whom Marcus claims is still a virgin despite the dates he “tries” to set him up on.
The cast, stereotypically melodramatic in some parts, charmingly sympathetic in others, achieve the latter effect best when they riff off each other, individually crucial parts to their mostly wholesome whole. Their understated performances feel natural—the tears in Laurent’s eyes as his wife and son leave him more believable than not, the growing strain on Simon's relationship with his daughter visible in the tightness of his face—and in spite of their differences, they come together to support one another in their respective times of need. When the man Mathilde is in love with calls her out on her stalking, for example—he has a wife and baby! He never loved her!—the men jump in front of her like dogs snarling at a trespasser, ready to protect their vulnerable owner at all costs.
Their loyalty is endearing, like that of hens blindly following their mother—literally. Despite being adults, the grown men act like children to the point of absurdity, their actions belying their age but salvaged by Ahmed Hamidi, Julien Lambroschini, and Lellouche’s occasionally overwrought but nevertheless witty screenplay. Three members of the aged brat pack decide to steal swimwear and gear instead of paying for it, get caught and are forced to pay an exorbitant fee, and neglect to tell Bertrand the outcome. Believing he is still the getaway driver, he crashes his car into another. In another attempt to swindle his car insurance company, Marcus sets fire to the company van, not having remembered that he cancelled his insurance plane because it was a “waste of money.” These blunders warrant the many laughs they elicit, but the characters’ unnecessarily puerile naivete feels too easy, their lives too in shambles for them to risk further worsening it.
The ensuing catastrophes constitute the mostly organic comic buildup to the show’s climax, when the self-dubbed “Team France” enters a national synchronized swimming competition. And of course, while they physically train for the competition, breaking their bodies under Amanda (Leïla Bekhti)—Delphine’s temporary, much harsher replacement—their emotional development mirrors their growing strength, enchanting if not predictable. “They look like they’re happy,” says Bertrand about the men, before having been unofficially welcomed in, to which Laurent unoriginally replies: “Looking isn’t being.” By the end, at least, they are, in some regard even if temporarily, and it’s that happiness that trounces the film’s inconsistencies in a successful splash of an unlikely comedy. Despite the film’s contrived denouement and the fact that most of Team France’s real problems have yet to be solved, its success is something the middle-aged men, in all their unconventionality, earns with their blood, sweat, and chlorine-induced tears.

In “Girl,” from debuting director Lukas Dhont, Victor Polster plays Lara, a female ballerina born in the body of a boy. For 15-year-old Lara, it’s a time marked by dramatic changes—her family, comprised of her father Mathias (Arieh Worthalter) and young brother Milo (Oliver Bodart), moves to a new city in Belgium so that Lara can pursue her aspirations of becoming a dancer. She also begins the process of transitioning into the opposite gender, a taxing, gradual ordeal that entails regular hormone injections and pills. But Lara, impatient to actualize her own goals, grows easily frustrated with slow progress—both in her ballet education and in her transition process—and begins to take action into her own hands, even if progress comes at the expense of her own well-being.
An intensely humanizing first feature, “Girl” comments frankly on the frustration of finding one’s own identity, of becoming oneself. It is a painful journey of self-understanding—one that Dhont does not shy away from depicting in all of its punishing stages, bolstered by gripping performances by Polster and Worthalter. Yet while “Girl” begins as a stunning body of work, it stumbles somewhere in its empathy, and doesn’t quite recover to stick the landing.
“Girl” would be nothing without Dhont’s compelling protagonist, whom he proves is, by all standards, an exacting perfectionist—from her dancing to her careful, almost forensic observation of her body. Lara demonstrates a great capacity for tolerating extreme pain to achieve her goals. It’s a pain that’s almost vicarious, as we watch her bend her bruised and bloodied toes at unnatural angles in order to be en pointe, sinking into excruciating splits, her Lycra leotard audibly stretching—even piercing her own ears, in the film’s opening scene, with nothing more than an ice cube and a stud earring. Dhont skillfully translates Lara’s dissatisfaction and insecurity onscreen with numerous mirror shots, Lara staring at the curves of her body, evaluating the progress of her breast growth as she continues to take hormones. The camera focuses keenly on Lara’s ballerina body, celebrating its sinew and muscle as she pirouettes and pliés across the ballet studio—and Polster’s real-life ballet prowess is a key asset in such a physically demanding role. Playing Lara is a viscerally physical job, even outside of the dance studio: Polster demonstrates a powerful ability to emote on little dialogue, capturing Lara’s flighty, nervous demeanor, the uncertainty of her body when she’s away from the barre.
On the whole, it’s not difficult to sympathize with Lara, given the immense struggle to understand her identity and the less-than-preferential treatment she faces at the hands of her ballerina peers. (There’s a bristling scene of a sleepover argument, in which one girl aggressively demands to see Lara’s genitalia.) Of course we are on Lara’s side, as we ought to be. But as “Girl” wears on, particularly toward the last third of the movie, it becomes harder to access her emotional interiority, as Polster plays the part with an impassive stare. The viewer begins to feel less aligned with Lara, and more aligned with her father, who spends much of the film trying to connect with her on some emotional level—and here, Worthalter is perfectly cast as the desperate parent, who experiences his daughter’s pain as instinctually as his own. “You never talk,” he bursts finally, exasperated. “I’m your father. Of course I’m worried about you. I ask how you’re doing and you say, ‘I’m fine. I’m fine.’”
“Maybe it’s because things are not all right,” Lara replies, embittered.
Lara has a point. Things are not all right—but the particulars of how or why or in what way sometimes fail to translate onscreen. Lara’s resentment of the people around her for failing to understand her personal struggle isn’t a new one—it’s the plight of all teenagers who feel misunderstood by the adults in their lives, which is to say, all teenagers. But as Lara buries her conflict more deeply within her own interiority, she becomes less and less reachable, her “I’m fine” and impassive stare creating barriers between the viewer and herself, beginning to sever the one connection on which the film depends.
Given Lara’s emotional arc, the jarring concluding scene of the film makes emotional sense, as it ought to. Yet it doesn’t feel quite earned by Lara’s character transformation, which feels slightly too interior to communicate, or perhaps at least not to the extent that Dhont intended. Still, “Girl” is a flagrantly beautiful work about childhood and parenthood, and humanizing one at that, breathing the same life and energy into its protagonist as she breathes into her art.

Cannes reporters Mila Gauvin II and Caroline A. Tsai offer a daily blog round-up from the 71st annual Cannes Film Festival in France.
0900 hours. I can’t tell if it’s just being surrounded by rich, beautiful people who parade around in Prabal Gurung and Elie Saab Couture gowns or tuxedos that cost more than my tuition, or sleeping at most four hours a night and subsisting on a diet of exclusively five-euro falafel sandwiches bought from street kiosks, but I think I’m starting to get uglier. Or maybe I’m just becoming more-self aware of my intense averageness. Being around beautiful people will do that to you. It’s like the ugly duckling, with a twist: Maybe with all the other ducklings, you feel ugly. But it’s only when you join a family of swans that you realize: What the hell? I’m a frog.
I’m starting to realize that Cannes is about these kinds of hierarchies more than people may realize. Class, race, color of press badge, age, gender, press badge color, height, hair color, color of press credentials—all of these equally salient factors are grounds for preferential treatment. Mila and I have a joke that the yellow press badge, the lowest tier at the Festival, grants you relative invisibility. Oh, what’s that? A yellow press badge? I don’t… I’m afraid I don’t see anything… Hmm… Did you hear something, Jacques? Mm… I don’t think so? Maybe the light Riviera breeze? Or perhaps a Chanel No. 5-scented fart slipped out of Dame Helen Mirren over there? Hmm.
You see? So many overlapping hierarchies, so many different classes of Festival attendees. That’s what’s really so puzzling about Cannes: You think you’ll run into so many celebrities on the street, but it’s like you inhabit two different versions of the same universe. You see pictures of them arriving at the same airport, or walking on the same red carpet, but it’s like you’re in the “Stranger Things” Upside Down-version of Cannes, which is nice, but a little greasy, and you have yet to see Jean-Luc Godard in the flesh. To really make this disparity clear, I have broken down a sample schedule of my day, as compared to what I imagine to be Oscar-winning actress and President of the Jury Cate Blanchett’s.
Cate Blanchett, 7 a.m.: Ah, another beautiful morning on the French Riviera. I sit up in my king-sized bed with silk sheets in the penthouse suite of the Hotel Majestic, then take in the ocean view from my 180-degree floor-to-ceiling windows. A gentle breeze rustles three garment bags on a rack near the door. Manuel must have brought in my evening gowns in the night—lovely, kind Manuel. Which shall I wear? A dove lands on the Yves Saint Laurent, then cocks its head. Destiny has decided. Thank you, destiny.
Caroline Tsai, 9 a.m.: “CAROLINE!” A tennis shoe narrowly misses my head in its trajectory through the air. I sit up in my twin bed of 200 thread-count cotton. Ah, I have not only bed hair, but chapped lips, retainer mouth, and eye crust. So, you know, my normal look. I slip into something a little less comfortable. It was ten dollars at Zara. And, quel surprise! This entirely synthetic polyester blend is not very breathable. Outside, a dove lands on my shoulder, then poops unceremoniously and flies away. Thank you, destiny.
Cate Blanchett, 8:30 a.m.: And it is time for the first screening of the day. I arrive in style, in a Renault luxury car, driven by Manuel. He opens the door for me as I exit onto the red carpet, and smiles. Manuel has been in love with me for three years and he can never have me. Loving me will only hurt him more. He drives away. Adieu, Manuel!
Caroline Tsai, 11 a.m.: And it is time for the first screening of the day. I arrive by foot and after minimal physical exertion, I am already sweaty. How fun and flirty! The security guard eyes the croissant I packed from breakfast in my bag like, really? You’re going to bring that greasy thing in here? Most of these people haven’t seen a carb in 10 years, and you’re going to traumatize them.
Cate Blanchett, noon: Time to make my graceful exit from the Palais. I am whisked away by a custom Renault, away into the gloriously sunny Riviera afternoon. Manuel is in the driver’s seat. He asks me how my morning was. Ah, Manuel—all day I am surrounded by people who only love me for my stunning, otherworldly beauty or my acting prowess. You’re the only one who truly understands me. Yet we can never be together.
Caroline Tsai, 1 p.m.: Damn. Do I even have time to get a falafel wrap from the kiosk? My next movie is at 4 p.m., but that really means I have to get there like, two hours early. But also I’m borderline hypoglycemic. Do I leave or not? Oh no, my foot crossed the doorway by a few inches and now I have legally left the building and need to go through security again to re-enter. Guess it’s falafel time.
Cate Blanchett, 3 p.m.: Time to return to the Palais for another premiere. This time I am wearing a custom-tailored Versace gown, stitched with five trillion individual Swarovski diamonds. It took 40,000 hours to stitch the bodice alone. “You look beautiful,” Manuel says gently, as I exit the Renault to the Entrée des Artistes. Oh Manuel. If only you knew how much I cared for you, how much I’ll always truly care for you…
Caroline Tsai, 1:30 p.m.: SCARF DOWN THE FALAFEL WRAP! NOW! BEFORE THE SECURITY GUARD SEES!
Cate Blanchett, 8:30 p.m.: Another glittering after-party, accompanied by all my closest friends. Oh, hello Leonardo! How absolutely ravishing you look tonight, Blake—how’s Ryan? Yet surrounded by the friends I love, soaking in luxury and fame, exchanging cheek kisses with Johnny Depp, why do I feel so terribly… alone?
Caroline Tsai, 8 p.m.: Ugh, now my stomach hurts, and I can’t go into the Salle de Soixantième for some reason. I think there’s a premiere of some kind, because there’s a huge swarm of fancy white people in suits, and the security guard keeps redirecting me toward the Entrée des Artistes. Excusez-moi monsieur, can this metal detector see my fear? No? Oh, God, now I’m trapped in the underground annals of the Palais. The inside of this place is a maze. All of it looks the same. Please help.
Cate Blanchett, midnight: Manuel drives me home from the party silently, the city of Cannes blurring through my car window. When the Renault pulls up to the Majestic, he turns off the car and turns back to me. This is it, I think. This is my moment to tell him how I feel. “I have something to tell you,” we say in unison. He looks embarrassed. “You go first,” I insist. Manuel takes a deep breath. “I must resign,” he says quietly. “You will have a new driver in the morning, Miss Blanchett. I am sorry.” I swallow my tears, then nod, a lump in my throat. “Of course,” I say, then get out of the car. Silly me. Before I shut the door, I bend down to meet his gaze. “Oh, and Manuel?” “Yes, Miss Blanchett?” he looks up. “Thank you.”
Caroline Tsai, 11:50 a.m.: “Miss?” The Wifi worker taps me on the shoulder. “The wifi room will be closing in 10 minutes.” I nod, finish the last sentence of my review, and start packing everything up obediently, downing the dregs of my fifth free can of blood orange Pellegrino. It tastes good, I decide as I exit the room, but nothing tastes as good as freedom.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“It’s no technique, but real emotion,” a dance instructor praises Odette. She has just performed an interpretive dance, a demonstration for the other students in the class. They watch her reverently.
“No technique?” repeats Odette, half-bemused, half-offended.
“I mean, there is technique,” the instructor corrects himself. “But you dance a state of being. It’s the state of a little girl suffering.”
Here, Odette blanches. The instructor’s response is one of many lines in “Les Chatouilles” (which translates to “Little Tickles”) that is unwittingly accurate. Odette Le Nadant, now a grown woman, has not been a little girl for many years. But the vestiges of her girlhood trauma color her adult life in ways she never could have predicted or controlled. Odette (played by writer-director Andréa Bescond) was once the victim of repeated childhood sexual assault, targeted by Gilbert Miguié (Pierre Deladonchamps), a family friend who claimed to see Odette as the daughter he never had and whom Odette’s parents trust with their lives. As Odette grows up, she bounces from dance, to drugs, to casual sex, anything to forget the trauma she endured as a child. But when she begins to see a therapist (Carole Franck), she learns that she must confront her abuse head on, no matter how painful it might be to relive—if not for her own sake, then for the sake of his next victims.
“No technique, but real emotion” might be a fitting description for “Les Chatouilles,” which toggles back and forth between flashbacks to Odette’s complicated past and numerous sessions with her therapist, in which she comes to terms with her history of abuse and begins to take action against her rapist. But Bescond, whose one-woman show is the film’s source material, and her creative partner for the film, Métayer, demonstrate their immense capacity for form as well as content, blending visual styles and mediums that structure Odette’s story: Interpretive dance over a stark black background expresses a range of transcendent, ineffable feelings that even the best dialogue or acting ever could. At first, the film’s dizzying leap from one temporal setting to another can be jarring, not to mention a bit off-putting so soon after the initial implied abuse. (And Bescond and Métayer all but show the abuse on-screen, the camera strategically angled a few inches too high.) But after the first act, the fast-paced jumps become par for the course for Bescond’s own story—one whose retelling is complex, painful, and at times, surprisingly funny.
In imaginatively-filmed therapy sessions that blur the boundaries of time and factuality, Bescond and Métayer show us what should have happened, what Odette wishes she could believe—she appears at the Opéra alongside famous Russian ballerina Rudolf Nureyev, she takes her best friend Manu (Gringe) to see krumpers in America, and most crucially, her father bursts in on Gilbert when he tries to molest her and violently retaliates—but each time, they deflect to the sad reality. She gets rejected from the Opéra school. Manu ends up in a cell, presumably for drug dealing. And we watch helplessly as Gilbert leads Odette into her bathroom, then closes the pink door. The constant rewriting of the truth and the film’s differing timelines would be confusing, if not for Pierre Aïm’s cinematography. Scenes cut swiftly from one to another, swirling past and present, scene and choreography into a continuous experience that preserves the substance of Bescond’s original play. Bescond imbues both her acting and choreography with a kind of urgency that’s enough to make anyone want to jump inside the screen and save Odette themselves, instead forced to clench their fists and helplessly witness her abuse as it plays out, wishing someone in her world would notice and rescue her.
If anything, “Little Tickles” is a testimony to the difficulty of survival after abuse. Odette’s coming-of-age entails more than a couple alcohol-fueled, drug-addled benders, sabotaging her relationships and professional dance career along the way. It does not shy away from the degree of immense fear and self-doubt that comes with confronting sexual abuse. “Why’d he keep it up? He could tell I didn’t like it,” the grown-up Odette muses out loud, watching from the sidelines as she watches Gilbert molest her younger self in a memory. “It’s rape, Odette,” her therapist says. It’s a simple statement, but a meaningful one, which confirms the validity of Odette’s experience—more than can be said about Odette’s own mother, Mado (Karin Viard), whose feelings of reluctance (“Let’s not rush to conclusions,” she cautions when the truth comes out) evolve horrifically into outright denial and rejection of her daughter’s testimony.
As much as “Little Tickles” is a film about victimhood, it is also a film about recovery and resilience. Each revisiting of Odette’s trauma is painful and hard to watch; yet by fleshing out her past, even imbuing it with some humorous anecdotes (a subplot with a flamboyant dancer called Benjamin is particularly memorable), Odette reclaims some fundamental autonomy, no longer a passive observer in her own narrative. “I will not be a living dead person,” she says defiantly, in the face of her mother’s denial. While Odette’s life is marked by undeniable suffering, it is hers to shape and control. Simply by the act of telling her therapist about her childhood, she becomes the author of her own story.

“Lazzaro Felice” (“Happy as Lazzaro”) is a mythological retelling loosely based on the true story that took place in Inviolata, Italy, where one Marquise Alfonsina de la Luna (Nicoletta Braschi) served as a monarch over workers held without payment on an undocumented tobacco plantation. In this version of “The highly illegal events that took place on the picturesque, bucolic land of Inviolata, the workers range from old grandmothers to babies, an uneducated population of 54 that does not know aspire to anything but unpaid work, foreseeably for the rest of their lives. Tancredi (Luca Chikovani), the Marquise’s eldest child, is a privileged brat desperate for city life. In another one of his antics, he forces the too good peasant Lazzaro (Adriano Tardiolo) to help him fake his own kidnapping, appropriating his inferior’s favorite hiding spot. Tancredi’s “kidnappers” ask for ransom, money the young man will take with him to start over once in the city. His mother, disappointingly used to his antics (he once pretended to have leprosy just to spite her), does not buy it—but his naive sister Teresa does, launching the de la Luna estate into a predicament that transcends space and, for some, time. Rohrwacher’s fifth feature film is a testament to her directorial talent, her visually stunning work as mythical as the tale it depicts.
“Lazzaro Felice” is a tale that—what a surprise!—centers on the character of Lazzaro. The young man is frustratingly innocent, obedient to a fault, and that’s the point: His dough eyes glow, his gaze piercing through the blissfully blank expression in permanent fixture on his face, suggesting a mindlessness that is in fact just pure docility: “Lazzaro, are you staring into the void?” asks his fellow servant; “Look what an honest face,” observes another. When Lazzaro is asked to sign a fake ransom letter with his own blood, Tancredi too cowardly to do it himself, Lazzaro does not hesitate to take his place in the act, indoctrinated by the brainwashing de la Luna has inflicted on their slaves and even themselves. In what becomes an alternate universe for Lazzaro, he aids robbers in stealing from the very estate he unknowingly was forced to help maintain. His naïveté is unrealistic, exasperatingly immovable, opening him up to the manipulation imposed on him. It is Tancredi’s that is the most impactful for Lazzaro, his dedication for the spoiled child solidified by Tancredi’s insistence that they are half-brothers, family that they will never be, but an ideal that Lazzaro somehow buys into. “You’re blocking the sun,” Tancredi warns Lazzaro. “A half brother would never do that.” Lazzaro isn’t supposed to be a realistic character because he can’t be: He transcends the laws of the universe, no doubt an allusion to the biblical saint that is his namesake, an unchanging fawn who inadvertently thrusts himself in a pack of wolves.
In “Lazzaro Felice,” mythological imagery abounds—there is, literally, a wolf whose lore is central to the film’s turning point—the narrative’s two parts mirroring the cinematographic evolution from the first into the second half of the film. Rohrwacher makes sure to juxtapose two sets of two starkly different worlds: the delicately pastoral and the harsh urban, and the real and folkloric. The plantation’s lush green fields are bathed in blinding sunlight so bright it’s nearly hallucinatory (perhaps foreshadowing what many of the characters ironically feel towards the last half of the film), a stark contrast to an unnamed Italian city’s grim architecture (which, despite the film’s title, Lazzaro’s psyche comes to mirror), in which the second half of the movie is set. The reality the de Lunas and their indentured servants reside in is one Lazzaro initially thrives in, his endlessly loyal compliance making him prime for the forced labor he is born into, but his ethereal mythos makes him unsuitable for the reality that leaves him behind for—spoiler alert—decades.
The film’s timelapse is one that plays with life and death, with what is real and what is not, with what we see and what Tancredi sees—because for Lazzaro, seeing is not believing. His experiences in the city do not disillusion him; though he yearns for a return to the nature he thrives in, he cannot adjust to the new life he has been given. Part white knight (“we have to fight with [my mother] like knights of old,” eggs Tancredi), part Ulyssian hero, part martyr for a return to a reality he has been displaced from, a life that no longer exists, Lazzaro has an ingenuousness that is inviolable, even outside of Inviolata. It is thanks to Rohrwacher’s artistic dexterity that “Lazzaro Felice” circumvents the easy misalignment of myth and reality, belying a misery that manifests in the single tear that trails off Happy Lazzaro’s face.

“Long Day’s Journey Into Night” (“Di Qiu Zui Hou De Ye Wan”) is, on paper, wholly unoriginal. It is far from being the first film to play on the gray area between dreams and reality—Christopher Nolan famously did it in “Inception,” and Makoto Shinkai uses it in his anime masterpiece “Your Name”—nor is it the only feature even in this iteration of the Cannes Film Festival to depict a loner’s exploration or experience of their hometown as they search for someone they loved and lost—”Ash Is Purest White” by Jia Zhangke is another Chinese film noir that depicts the same conceit, Eva Husson’s “Les Filles Du Soleil” a harrowing version of the trope. What director Bi Gan does in “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” that differentiates it from its predecessors and fellow premieres, though, is make 3D film into a cinematic experience integral to the film’s second half, in a way that amplifies the first half’s slow-moving narrative—both in direction and in plot—a beautiful tale of a man in search of the ghost of his past, one he isn’t even sure ever existed.
Indeed, Bi Gan’s film hinges on ambiguity—between dream and reality, between past and present, between passive gazes and purposeful scrutiny. It follows Luo Hongwu (Huang Jue), looking for one Wan Qiwen (Tang Wei). He met her a summer he is slowly forgetting, one he hopes to remember by returning after decades to his hometown of Kaili, where he fell for her. Throughout the film, memories of Wan appear in flashbacks, the direction mirroring Luo’s uncertainty as to the factuality of his memories. “Whenever I’m about to forget her, I dream of her,” he contemplates, bringing her back to life in a fantasy, an altered memory, or both, despite Wan’s prescient warning: “The less you remember, the less you forget.” The aphoristic dialogue veers far from the trite, however, more nostalgic than mawkish, a poetic mapping of Luo’s jumbled thoughts that seeps into the storytelling itself. When we learn the origin behind the book Luo still has of Wan’s, we ask the same questions Luo does. Did she leave the green book—which was meant to be bequeathed to the man she liked the most—for him on purpose? Or did she simply forget it, accidentally leaving it in Luo’s clutches, a man she never thinks she’ll see again?
Bi makes sure to play with this equivocal gaze and (mis)perception in his direction the same way he does with the questionable factuality of Luo’s reality: We don’t know whether what Luo experiences and remembers is real or not, but we do know, at least, that it is genuine. After all, “dreams are lost memories,” a reminiscence that may or may not hold credence in reality but that does for Luo, which is the dubiety Bi plays with. After Luo and Wan first meet, the camera drifts into the tunnel she walks in while he follows her in his car, hopelessly crawling after her in a shot that alternates between depicting them from behind—going toward the light at the end of the tunnel, Wan’s green dress iridescent as what little light that shines through glints off its satin sheen—and shooting the two through the window of Luo’s car, his head perched toward Wan as she stares sullenly forward. Eventually, she asks him if he will keep following her to the end of the tunnel. What she doesn’t realize is that he never stops—at least, not until he himself dives into another reality, one where everything is augmented, except for Luo’s feelings for Wan. “Memory rusts,” says Luo of his time with Wan. It’s no wonder, than, that Bi brings us into a world untarnished by the phantoms of a past that no longer exists outside of Luo’s imagination.
Bi brings us into that world with innovative, masterful technique that subverts the “Long Day’s Jouney”’s buildup to its climax. “This is not a 3D film,” reads a title card at the beginning of the film. And at its core, “Long Journey” is not just a 3D film—it’s a film noir that’s beautifully colored, exquisitely filmed in long-lasting shots that linger (sometimes too much) on its content, using unexpected angles and lighting to counteract the expected. But when Luo goes to the movie theatre to kill time before maybe perhaps finally potentially seeing Wan Qiwen, he dives into a 3D experience—a dream? An actual film?—and brings the viewer along into what is sure to be the most celebrated part of the film: a cinematic masterpiece that uses 3D not as a supplementary, money-grubbing addition to an already stunning piece of art, but that integrates 3D so seamlessly—quite literally—into a 55-minute-long take, a fundamental element that elevates the film to the stars the characters nearly touch, in one of many ethereal scenes.
In the maybe memory-dream, maybe film (“The difference between films and memories is that movies are always false whereas memories tell both lies and the truth,” says a character in the film’s first half, a foreshadowing, self-referential observation. I would personally like to believe the film within the film is in fact a future memory, one Luo does experience in all its truth and falsehood), Luo eventually encounters another woman with whom he embarks on what the title symbolizes, made literal in what is more of an endless rather than long journey into night. The couple flies, breaks apart only to come back together, and explores an abandoned house with a room that is rumored to spin. Time is illusory, a broken clock symbolizing eternity, a dying firework exemplifying the transitory, but none of that matters. “I worried about who was flying to the stars,” says Luo before the 3D portion of the film. He no longer has to wonder: Bi brings both him and the film to the heights of what cinema can achieve in a visual masterpiece that powerfully integrates an overworked concept into an exquisite filmic experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 16, 2018 at 10:07 a.m.
Around 82 percent of students admitted to the Class of 2022 have accepted their offers of admission so far, though more students will be admitted from the waitlist in the coming months.
This year’s yield rate represents a slight decrease from last year’s rate. A record-high 84 percent of students had accepted their offers to the Class of 2021 around this time a year ago. The final yield rate for the Class of 2021—that is, the percentage of admitted students that actually joined the class—was 82.8 percent.
In total, 42,749 prospective students applied to the Class of 2022, and the College accepted 4.59 percent of those students—1,962 in total—during the early admission and regular decision rounds.
A number of waitlisted students are slated to receive formal notifications of admission Wednesday, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. This marks a departure from last year, when the record-high yield resulted in no students being admitted from the waitlist. The Class of 2021’s unusual size prompted the College to assign 28 freshmen to overflow housing in DeWolfe apartments.
“We would love, normally, to be able to take anywhere from 30 or 40, to as many as 100 off the waiting list,” Fitzsimmons said.
He said the College would likely continue to send admissions offers to waitlisted students throughout the summer, with the assumption that some students will decline their offers.
“We finish all this by the end of June,” Fitzsimmons said. “We’ll see what happens with the ones we have admitted. We don’t know whether they’ll decide to come or not. Typically not all of them will, but we give them about a week or so to make up their minds.”
With admits off the waitlist in flux, the makeup and size of the Class of 2022 have yet to be finalized, and the final matriculation rate may change over the course of the summer. The College will obtain final numbers when students arrive at Harvard on August 27.  The admissions office anticipated an estimated 1,655 students would join the class.
Fitzsimmons attributed the relatively high yield rate, in part, to the admissions officers’ recruiting efforts.
“We go to 120 locations across the country every year,” he said. “You don’t think of it as a yield thing, but, in lots of ways, it really is, because you’re trying to get people to think about Harvard as a possibility.”
He also emphasized the value of informing prospective students of the College’s financial aid program. The majority of students who currently plan to matriculate will receive financial aid, and a record-high 19.3 percent are eligible for Pell Grants, Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donohue wrote in a press release. Additionally, as the class stands now, a record 16.6 percent will be first-generation students, compared to last year’s 14.9 percent.
A record-high 22.6 percent of matriculants to date are Asian-American. This record comes amid an ongoing lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian-Americans in the admissions process, as well as a pending Department of Justice investigation into similar complaints. Also a record high, African Americans make up 14.5 percent of those planning to matriculate. Consistent with numbers in previous years, Latino students comprise 10.8 percent of the total, and Native Americans and Native Hawaiians 2.3 percent.
Also consistent with recent years, matriculating students so far are 49.7 percent female and 50.3 percent male.
Fitzsimmons praised the diversity of students’ backgrounds and said he believes this diversity will provide extensive educational benefits.
“To learn from people from every conceivable background will put you in a much better position to make a positive difference in the world,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The country’s top 14 law schools—including Harvard Law School—will now require firms that recruit on campus to reveal whether they require summer associates to sign mandatory arbitration agreements or non-disclosure agreements that may bar associates from going public with allegations of workplace misconduct.
Mandatory arbitration agreements require employees to resolve workplace disputes with employers through an arbitration process, rather than through the courts. Non-disclosure agreements require employees to keep information relating to the firm confidential—including reports of sexual harassment or discrimination.
Amid the #MeToo movement—which has brought national attention to the problem of workplace harassment and implicated powerful men across industries—some law firms have recently begun requiring summer associates to sign such agreements. Students at Harvard and other schools have raised concerns in recent months that the agreements will cover up harassment and discrimination.
Yale Law School, one of the 14 schools involved, announced the law schools’ pact to compel firms to disclose this practice in a press release Monday.
The release states that the law schools will send a survey to each employer who recruits summer associates at the T14 law schools—the 14 schools consistently at the top of the U.S. News & World Report law school rankings—in order to determine whether they require their employees to sign workplace harassment-related agreements.
“The survey—issued today by Yale Law School with input and support from all Top 14 law schools—will require firms to disclose whether they require summer associates to sign forced arbitration agreements and related NDAs,” the release stated. “They will also be asked to provide essential information regarding firm policies for responding to workplace misconduct.”
The action comes after a group of Law School students published an open letter calling for the school to ensure that law firms who recruit on campus “protect the rights of their employees” to come forward and seek legal action if they “experience harassment, discrimination, or workplace abuse.”
The open letter called for the Office of Career Services to require employers who recruit on campus to remove the mandatory arbitration and non-disclosure agreements from their contracts. In addition, the group of students requested the Law School to create and distribute “an anonymous workplace climate survey” for students who return from summer employment.
Sejal Singh, a first-year Law School student and one of the organizers of the open letter, said she is “confident” that this survey will lead firms to remove the agreements in question rather than disclose them to the participating schools.
Singh also stated that while the Office of Career Services at Yale Law School is taking charge of this initiative, that office plans to work closely with other T14 law schools to ensure employers on each campus are given the survey without overlap.
“We’re hoping that this will streamline the process and make sure there’s a minimal administrative burden but we’re also getting the detail that we need for students to make an informed choice of where to work,” Singh said.
Molly M. E. Coleman, another Law student and organizer of the letter, said she and other organizers met regularly with Assistant Dean for Career Services Mark A. Weber over the course of the semester, and she praised his attention to the issue.
“We have been meeting regularly with Mark Weber, we’ve been in communication with him and he’s just been extremely helpful and extremely responsive on this,” Coleman said.
In an emailed statement Tuesday, Weber lauded student leaders and wrote that about 50 schools have signed on to the survey to date.
“I have really enjoyed working with the student leaders at Harvard, who have been thoughtful, committed and effective; and it has been a real pleasure collaborating with my T14 colleagues on this important project,” Weber wrote. “It has truly been a team effort.”
