After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And the streak continues.
With victories over Brown and Penn on Saturday, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (7-0, 5-0 Ivy) continued its undefeated season in quest of its second consecutive Ivy League title.
The Crimson defeated the Bears (1-2, 0-2) by a score of 237-63 and the Quakers (3-5, 2-5), 190-108, topping the podium in 13 of 16 events. In its first return to Ivy competition since November 21st when Harvard faced Columbia, the Crimson looked to be in peak form heading into the important Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet in two weeks.
“Our goal for the weekend was just to do better than we did at Duke and South Carolina, [and] overall as a team we did that,” freshman Steven Tan said. “We had better times, we had better swims, and it was just an overall better meet for us…. We stepped up to race right at the beginning, which we didn’t do at Duke, so we had a lead right from the beginning.”
While the victory was a team effort, two of Harvard’s youngest swimmers led the charge. Tan led the pack with four wins on the day. Meanwhile, fellow freshman Shane McNamara was close behind with three first place finishes.
“We’ve seen a lot of growth in the freshmen,” co-captain Michael Gaudiani said. “Time-wise, they’ve been really fast, but also I’ve seen growth mentally a lot as athletes. The college season is pretty different from what they’re used to in high school, and I think these freshmen especially have made great strides adapting to that college mindset.”
Tan and McNamara kicked off the meet with a victory in the 200-medley relay alongside classmate Koya Osada and sophomore Paul O’Hara, posting a time of 1:30.34, which beat out the Crimson combination of sophomores Jack Manchester, Eric Ronda, junior Jacob Luna, and senior Griffin Schumacher who took third.
But that first place finish was just the start for Harvard. The team would go on to win the next six consecutive events to solidify its lead. Wins from senior Spenser Goodman, Tan, McNamara, junior Christian Carbone, and Schumacher seemed to put the meet out of reach for the Crimson’s opponents.
Senior Michael Mosca continued his domination on the diving board for Harvard, sweeping both the one-meter and three-meter events.
The meet started with a win by Tan and ended in similar fashion. The rookie was first to touch the wall in two of the final three wins for the Crimson.
Brown did not win any events, with its top event coming on a second place finish by Jonathan Schlafer in the one-meter dive with a score of 307.60. The Bears fell to both Harvard and the Quakers in the meet.
Penn, on the other hand, was 1-1 on the day as it defeated the Bears by a score of 203-95. The team showed its strength in the distance events, with junior Chris Swanson claiming victories in the 1000 and 500 freestyle races.
The Crimson returns to its home pool in two weeks for its final contest before the Ivy League Championship against Yale and Princeton in the storied HYP meet.
Harvard will face its toughest Ivy competition when it competes at HYP, as the Tigers and Bulldogs are also undefeated in Ivy competition and are a consistent threat every season for the Ivy title. According to Tan, though the Crimson has won several meets with ease thus far this season, the focus for the rest of the season will not be the past wins, but the wins the team continues to seek as it heads into the peak of the season.
“Once you step on the blocks, its time to race,” Tan said. “Whether or not you’re tired, you’re sore, or we had a hard week of training, as soon as you step on the blocks and you see your teammates or competitors, it's race time. It’s really not a time to think about the past but really focus on the present.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes home field is not an advantage after all, as the Harvard wrestling team came to find out Saturday, losing to No. 7 Cornell (8-0, 2-0 EIWA) in its home and Ivy League opener.
Coming off of a six-day rest period, the Crimson (1-3, 0-2) could not pull off the upset, falling to the Big Red, 30-8.
“We came off of a tough weekend in Washington D.C. where we wrestled hard but came up a little short at times,” senior heavyweight David Ng said. "But despite that we had a great week of practice. I know that when we compete the way we train we're a tough team to beat.”
Harvard recorded only two wins in the dual meet, coming from the duo of Ng and junior co-captain Todd Preston.
Preston, who is ranked the 17th best wrestler in the country, claimed the first win of the meet at 141 lbs. on a technical fall by his opponent Ryan Dunphy.  He led the bout early, coming up with four takedowns in the first period.
In the following two periods, Preston added three sets of back points. His win added five points to the Crimson scoreboard, giving the team its first win. The senior now has won four straight matches in dual meets.
Ng’s win—a 6-1 victory over Jacob Aiken-Phillips—came too late for the Crimson. It was his third consecutive win, and while it gave Harvard three points, it was not enough to give his team the win.
“I'm happy with my the way I wrestled because I beat a guy who has beaten me a few times in the past,” Ng said. “That being said, there's a lot of room for improvement, and I'm just going to take my season one match at a time.”
Outside of these two wins, however, the Big Red dominated the meet.
Due to the absence of Cornell’s Nahshon Garrett, the match at 125 lbs. was uncontested. The meet started at 133 lbs. with senior Ryan Osleeb pitted against the Big Red's Bricker Dixon. Dixon controlled the bout from the beginning and clinched a 10-0 major decision, giving Cornell an early 4-0 lead.
After Preston’s win, the Big Red won the next six bouts in the following weight classes, five of which were for bonus points. This put the fate of the meet in Cornell’s hands.
Junior Nicholas Stager, freshman Tyler Tarsi, and sophomore Tyler Grimaldi all had technical falls in the 149 lbs., 157 lbs., and 165 lbs. weight categories, widening the gap between Harvard’s and Cornell’s scores. Junior Michael Mocco put up a fight against the top-ranked wrestler in the 184 lb. weight category, the Big Red's Gabe Dean, but could not top him.
“I personally had the same kind of situation as the team did, where....we’re good and work hard, we’re on the level, but we’re up against the best,” Mocco said.
Freshman Josef Johnson’s bout against Cornell's Craig Eifert at 174 lbs. was the closest of the day, with Johnson only losing by one point in a 10-9 decision. All of the other matches, except for the heavyweight one, were won by 10 points or more.
“Wrestling a team as tough as Cornell gives us a look at the steps that we need to take in order to become a top-10 team in the country,” Ng said. “Those guys fight for every single point and are stingy when giving up points.  When you wrestle a guy from Cornell, win or lose it's going to be a battle, and that's a big part of making that next level jump.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s volleyball team traveled to Illinois to face off against two of the nation’s top teams. The Crimson fell to No. 5 Lewis, 3-1, on Friday and top-ranked Loyola, 3-0, on Saturday in the team’s first two matches of the season.
The Flyers (4-1, 2-0 MIVA) and Ramblers (3-0) came to Cambridge last season and beat Harvard (0-2) by the same scores, but junior outside hitter Branden Clemens could see the improvement, especially against Lewis.
“Our Friday match against Lewis was really good and very competitive,” Clemens said. “I think it was good getting to see that compared to last year, we played a lot better. After the first set last year, we kind of fell apart. I thought it was really good [this year] seeing us compete, especially since it was our first match of the season.”
LOYOLA 3, HARVARD 0
Saturday’s match proved to be a Loyola sweep despite two close sets between the hosts and the Crimson. In the first set, the two teams went back and forth, with neither team holding more than a three-point advantage. After alternating ten straight points, the Ramblers picked up the last two to salvage a 25-23 victory. Loyola had 16 kills to Harvard’s 11 in the first frame.
In the second set, the Ramblers jumped out to a 12-6 lead and took the set, 25-17. Down 2-0, the Crimson jumped out to a 4-2 lead in the third that it would never retain. Despite a late charge from the Crimson, Loyola was able to hang on to win, 25-22.
“[Saturday] was a really tough match against a very good team,” Clemens said. “They’re number one in the country for a reason. I thought we were close to them, we almost took the first set. I thought for us, getting to play the number-one ranked team in the country, we played really well. There were some things we could have done better, but on the whole, we gave them a really good fight and it shows promise for the rest of the season.”
The Crimson had 30 kills for the game, while the Ramblers finished with 50. Sophomore outside hitter Casey White tied for the team lead with seven kills and led Harvard with seven digs. Freshman setter Marko Kostich, playing in his second collegiate game, had 27 assists. Fellow first-year Brad Gretsch had seven kills from the middle blocker position.
“[Brad] played really well,” co-captain Caleb Zimmick said. “He definitely stepped up and was a consistent force in the middle, closed a lot of blocks, and had a lot of timely kills. Marko really played well [on Saturday]. It’s hard coming in as a freshman and connecting with all the hitters, but I think he handled it well.”
LEWIS 3, HARVARD 1
The Crimson started the season off on Friday by winning the first set against the Flyers before dropping the next three. The team was led by the brothers White—Casey recorded 13 kills and 14 digs, while co-captain DJ had 12 and seven respectively.
The first set was tied 25-25 and in the ensuing tiebreaker, a service error by Lewis senior outside hitter Geoff Powell and blocks by Clemens and Gretsch gave Harvard a 27-25 victory. The Crimson jumped out to an early lead in the second set before the hosts won 10 of the final 16 points to claim a 25-16 victory. Harvard dropped the third set, 25-21, and the fourth, 25-20.
“I wasn’t exactly sure how we were going to come out, but we played really well right away,” Zimmick said. “It was encouraging to see, just because we have younger guys on the court. Taking the first step against Lewis in their gym [where] they had a huge crowd, it was very exciting. It definitely set the tone for the team we can be and the team we want to be going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard skiing team kicked off its 2015 campaign at the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association’s Bates College Winter Carnival. The two-day event was held at the Sunday River and Black Mountain ski resorts in Maine, attracting many of the country’s top collegiate teams.
The event was also the first collegiate race for many of the Crimson’s freshmen.
“We’ve done a couple of non-collegiate races earlier this month, and that helps to kind of knock some of the rust off,” said Harvard Alpine coach Tim Mitchell. “A [regular season] race is always a little bit different. For the freshman, it was good. They got a good taste of what [the collegiate] level is like.”
The Crimson participated in six events in the 16-team carnival and placed ninth as a team. Vermont won the competition, while Ivy League foe Dartmouth placed second. On the men’s side, Harvard was led by senior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci, while it was sophomore Rachel Hampton leading the way for the Crimson women.
“I think it was a really good weekend for me,” Hampton said. “I was aiming to be aggressive this weekend and really sort of test myself and see how far I could push myself up toward the leader. I think that [staying with the top pack] really paid off, and I was able to hang with them. I think it was a strong start for me, but I definitely feel like there’s more to improve on.”
Harvard partook in two Alpine competitions and four Nordic ones over the weekend. In her first collegiate action for the Crimson, freshman Kelly Steeves placed 33rd in the women’s giant slalom and 36th in the women’s slalom.
Junior Samantha Udolf placed 42nd in the women’s giant slalom. Harvard’s two female Alpine skiers earned the Crimson 10th place in the giant slalom and 13th in the slalom. On the men’s side, juniors Jack Stobierski and Simon Merryweather did not finish.
“In general, I thought I was a little bit more pleased with what I saw Saturday,” Mitchell said. “I thought that that was closer to what I think we’re capable of…. I don’t think any of the guys on the team or the girls are particularly satisfied with how they skied, which is good. They know they’re all capable of more than that.”
The cross country events for the Bates Carnival were split over Friday and Saturday. The men skied the 20-kilometer race on Friday and the 10-kilometer one on Saturday. The women had their 15-kilometer race on the first day and their five-kilometer one on the second.
In the 20-kilometer race, Maifeld-Carucci placed ninth after finishing in an hour and 15 seconds. Freshman Connor Green placed 36th in his collegiate debut. The team’s score on the first day was good enough for eighth.
On Saturday, Harvard had five of its six skiers improve their finishes. Maifeld-Carucci finished second overall in the 10-kilometer race—the best finish for a Crimson skier over the weekend. Green placed 38th while freshman Haakon Sigurslid moved up 22 spots from Friday to finish 54th and sophomore Devlin Shea moved up 17 spots to 56th. The team also finished eighth on Saturday.
On the women’s side, Hampton finished 15th, sophomore Maile Sapp 34th, and juniors Annie Harvieux and Hanna Barnes took 44th and 48th, respectively, in Friday’s 15-kilometer race. Harvieux moved up to 18th, Hampton finished 20th, Barnes 44th, and Sapp 47th. Senior Emily Rogers took 41st. The team placed ninth on Friday and sixth on Saturday.
“I think it was a really solid performance by pretty much everyone on the team,” Hampton said. “It was a good way to start the season off. I think we still have some work to do and get our feet underneath us, but it was a really strong start, and I think we showed everybody that we are definitely a team to be reckoned with this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When senior forward Kalley Armstrong scored to put the Harvard women’s hockey team up, 2-1, over Dartmouth with 10 minutes left to play, the goal set off one of the most raucous celebrations of the season.
Armstrong leapt into the arms of sophomore forward Syndey Daniels, and fist-pumping teammates soon surrounded the pair in front of a suddenly silent stadium in Hanover, N.H.
However, such exuberance did not last long. The Big Green (10-7-1, 6-5-1 ECAC) equalized one minute later, went ahead on a power-play score two minutes after that, and added an empty-net goal to skate off the ice with a 4-2 upset.
For the No. 5/5 Crimson (11-3-2, 9-2-1 ECAC), the loss snapped a 10-game winning streak that began in late November.
“Honestly, we had a much better third period than the first two, so I didn’t feel like the score reflected our play,” senior forward Lyndsey Fry said. “They had a few bounces go their way in the third, and that’s just how it goes sometimes.”
Dartmouth forward Lindsey Allen entered Saturday’s contest as the second-leading scorer in the ECAC, but for the first 51 minutes of action, the Harvard defense held her in check. The junior star made menacing cuts, hitting four shots on frame, but she did not score.
All that changed with nine minutes left in regulation. As the Crimson clung to a 2-1 advantage, Allen collected the puck and pushed a finish past Harvard goalie Emerance Maschmeyer.
Although the Crimson responded with three consecutive shots, an interference call on Daniels slammed this momentum to a halt. It was on the ensuing power play that the Big Green scored the game-winner.
Announced at 1,027, the attendance was the largest number of spectators to see Harvard play this season, and the atmosphere injected a special intensity into the game from the opening faceoff.
“I think the fact that we responded to them scoring their first goal so quickly demonstrated that we don’t let crowds get in our heads,” Fry said. “We love playing in front of a big crowd. Sadly it doesn’t happen enough in women’s hockey.”
The energy was already building in the first period, when the hosts conceded a late goal despite jumping out to a 15-6 shot advantage. Crimson forward Hillary Crowe gave Harvard the lead by receiving a cutting pass from senior forward Sami Reber near the crease and flipping the puck over the goalie.
The finish came just 12 seconds after Maschmeyer smothered a breakaway opportunity on the other end. The junior goalkeeper finished the match with 32 saves, her second-highest total of the season.
“I would’ve expected them to score more early on,” Fry said. “Emmerance held us in it.”
The shutout ended when the hosts scored seven minutes into the third frame to knot the score at 1-1.
Three minutes later, Armstrong responded with her finish and corresponding celebration.
After Allen’s goal, Dartmouth forward Brooke Ahbe scored a power play goal to regain the lead for the home team.
Despite holding the Big Green scoreless for almost two and a half stanzas, Maschmeyer was not even in goal for Dartmouth’s fourth goal. In the final minute, Allen added an empty-net finish to earn her second goal of the game and ice the victory.
The score, which arrived 20 seconds after Maschmeyer substituted off the ice, came on the heels of two power plays for the Big Green. The first led to the go-ahead goal; the second, the result of a roughing penalty on Crowe, forced a Crimson squad that desperately needed a score to play two minutes of defense.
The defeat dropped Harvard to third in the ECAC standings behind Quinnipiac and Clarkson.
“I think [Dartmouth] just capitalized on the few opportunities we gave them,” Fry said. “There weren’t many, but they took advantage.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams hosted their first meets of the season at the Gordon Indoor Track with the Harvard Multi Meet and the Beantown Challenge this weekend.
The meets would prove to be successful, as the teams combined for three school records and five meet records while taking home 13 titles between them.
BEANTOWN CHALLENGE
The Crimson wrapped up its weekend at the Beantown Challenge, as the team competed with Ivy League rivals Brown and Cornell as well as fellow northeast schools Army, UMass and Northeastern.
Both teams attained success with the women taking home its fifth straight Beantown title and the men claiming second behind the Big Red.
“I was very happy with the way we competed not just individually but as a team,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great to see so many meet records fall as well as school records.”
In the field events, sophomore Nikki Okwelogu claimed the title and broke her school record in the shot put for the second straight week with a mark of 16.09 meters, continuing her season-long success.
Fellow field athletes Taylor DuPont and Reagan Nizdil took home titles in the weight throw and high jump, respectively. DuPont’s throw of 16.88 meters landed the senior in fifth place within the record book.
Back at the track, records dropped. Sophomore Jade Miller won the 500 meter record and title with a time of 1:13.14, while captain Erika Veidis, the previous 500 meter record holder, took home another record with a 1000 meter winning time of 2:46.71.
“The school records stand out the most,” Saretsky said. “Nikki watching her record fall for the second week in a row, [and] Erika Veidis losing her record in the 500 to Jade Miller but then taking the 1000.”
Paige Kouba set a personal record in the mile with a time of 4:49.99, while junior Autumne Franklin and sophomore Jackie Modesett would go one-two in the 60 meter hurdles with times of 8.62 and 8.65 seconds, respectively.
The 880-yard race saw senior Gabrielle Scott take home the title with a mark of  2:13.41 before Scott, Modesett, Fraklin and Miller would combine to take home the 4x400 yard relay in 3:46.81.
The Crimson men were not to be left out, as freshman Malcom Johnson led the track athletes with a 6.75 second victory in the 60 meter dash. The rookie broke the school freshman record and is now the second fastest 60 meter runner in school history.
The male field specialists contributed as well, with captain Ben Glauser setting a meet record in the weight throw with an 18.77 meter toss, which also claimed the title. He also took second in the shot put.
While the team shook up the record books this weekend, there is reason to think that it could happen again later on in the season.
“Each week should be better up until we get to indoor heps,” Glauser said. “I would expect a lot of records to be broken throughout the remainder of the season.”
HARVARD MULTI MEET
The Crimson got the weekend started by hosting the Harvard Multi Meet, consisting of the women’s pentathlon and the first four events of the men’s heptathlon.
The Harvard women demonstrated their versatility in the pentathlon as junior Madison Hansen captured the title with 3,657 points—her second-highest career total.
Hansen was joined in the top six by first time pentathlon competitors Allison Morrison and Modesett with the junior and sophomore athletes finishing third and sixth, respectively.
“It was a great showing for them.” Saretsky said. “It’s one of the hardest events on the track with five different disciplines…. I was pleased with their showing, and it’ll be one of our strongest events during Heps.”
In addition to the overall success, there were various notable individual performances with Modesett and Hansen going one-two in the 60 meter hurdles, while Morrison took second in the high jump with a 1.66 meter finish—the second highest in her career.
The success continued as sophomore Haley Baker would place first in the shot put by one one-hundreth of a meter while the 800 meter podium was colored crimson with Hansen, Morrison and Modesett taking second, third and fourth respectively.
On the men’s side, individual success was the highlight through the first four events with freshman Andrew Bolze taking second in the shot put and junior Mark Hill placing second in the high jump with a 1.93 meter leap.
In addition to the success, being at home for the first time was one of the biggest benefits for the team according to Glauser.
“I really like that meet because not only is it home but everyone competes together.” Glauser said. “In track you don’t necessarily have that…. It was nice to have everybody there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With less than 12 minutes remaining in the first half of their game against NJIT, the Harvard women’s basketball team found itself facing a 16-point deficit and in desperate need of a jolt of energy. And so Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith changed things up, replacing all five players on the court in an effort to rally the Crimson in their final non-conference matchup.
The strategy proved to be successful, as Harvard (7-8, 0-1 Ivy) reignited on both the offensive and defensive ends of the floor on its way to a hard-fought 66-54 victory over NJIT (8-11). The Crimson was particularly aided by contributions from its bench players, as ten different players logged over 10 minutes in the contest.
“I don’t like that slow start, I don’t like that we went down, but I loved our reaction to it,” Delaney-Smith said. “I just put in kids who had never played yet, and I didn’t care because they were going to go out there with heart and soul and desire, and that’s all I’m looking for…. Even though the basketball was questionable at times, I still loved the effort.”
Sophomore Grace Keane made the most of the opportunity, draining a three-pointer midway through the first half in her first appearance this season. The tally sparked a 22-4 run for Harvard, and the croup slowly chipped away at the Highlanders’ lead for the remainder of the period. Captain Erin McDonnell nailed a jump shot to give the Crimson its first lead of the game with less than two minutes remaining in the half, and then Harvard headed into the break tied, 33-33.
“We had the momentum at that point,” McDonnell said. “So then it’s, ‘Okay, look, it’s zero to zero, new game, let’s come out like we did halfway through the first half….We were more aggressive on defense, we tried to be smarter on offense and execute our plays.”
The Crimson started off the second half with a renewed energy on offense, allowing NJIT to regain the lead just once, at 36-35, before pulling away and never looking back. After struggling to contain the Highlanders’ shooting throughout the first half, Harvard’s defense also stepped up, turning up the pressure with a full-court press that threw the visiting team off their rhythm.
“I think [the comeback] was a big testament to the character and heart of our team,” McDonnell said. “Everybody stepped up, we used all of our weapons, and…we played with more heart, too. Winning the 50-50s, rebounds, loose balls, all of that generated a lot of positive energy.”
Senior Temi Fagbenle led the charge for the Crimson in the second half, scoring 15 of her team-leading 22 points and pulling down six rebounds after halftime. Fellow seniors McDonnell and Ali Curtis chipped in 10 and nine points, respectively, but it was freshman Anna Lachenauer who impressed in the absence of junior AnnMarie Healy, who sat out the contest after leading Harvard in scoring last week against Dartmouth. The freshman scored nine points and grabbed seven rebounds in a career-high performance.
“[AnnMarie] has been immense, but...it was time for Anna Lachenauer to step up,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a heck of a player, we’re just waiting for her to bust out and do that in a game, and she came close today. She did a nice job for us today, especially for a freshman.”
Despite a valiant effort by NJIT, a 8-1 run by Harvard, fueled by six points from Lachenauer, put the game comfortably out of the visitors’ reach with eight minutes left to play. Sophomore Leah Horton and senior Nicole Maticka led the Highlanders with 13 and 12 points, respectively.
“[Today’s game] was exactly what the doctor ordered for us,” Delaney-Smith said. “There’s a lot of lessons we need to get taught....never be bothered by anything, don’t let anything set you back on your heels…. I thought we did that better today than in any game so far.”
