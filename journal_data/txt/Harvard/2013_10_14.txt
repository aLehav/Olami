After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Imagine this moment were real,” says Leila, the young girl standing in the middle of the stage who has been trying to retell her story. It’s the middle of a production of David Greig’s chilling play“Yellow Moon,” and up until this point, you had been sure that every previous scene was indeed real—or, at least real in the context of the play’s narrative. But the production of the play directed by Susanna B. Wolk ’14, which ran through Saturday in the Loeb Ex, challenged the very notion that the audience can trust the narrators on stage.
What started out as a seemingly linear narrative—teenage Leila (Juliana N. Sass ’17) meets delinquent Lee (Eli W. Pelton ’16) and they run away after Lee commits accidental murder—quickly became a whirl of mistaken memory, jumbled time and place, and completely imagined scenes, all delivered with surprising coherence and impressive fluidity.
The play began quietly and simply, with Leila crouched center stage, scrawling the title of her story, “The Ballad of Leila and Lee,” with chalk on the floor. The set design likewise was simple: characters mimed various props, with only two boxes onstage and pillows scattered on four sides of the black box theater for the audience to make itself comfortable. The perimeter in which the story unfolded was outlined in a long white rope, its end winding to the center of the stage where it meandered to a halt in the middle of Leila’s handwritten title. Wolk’s inspired staging had the actors interacting with this rope, using it as the outline of a car, a doorway, and even a dead deer. The lighting by Madeleine F. Bersin ’14 was incredibly effective in heightening the intensity of the story—actors used flashlights in the dark theater and spotlights arranged at the diagonal corners of the performance space to illuminate each other during monologues and particularly powerful scenes. As the story progressed and Leila’s life became more entangled with Lee’s fugitive existence, both characters began to play out scenes that never actually occurred, each attempting to correct or rewrite parts of their history that were painful to remember.
To complicate matters, it was not just the two protagonists who jumbled the narrative—actors Brenna K. McDuffie ’15 and Justin S. Pereira ’13, each playing roles as parents of the two teens and other adult figures, played with the progression of events as well. When characters narrate the events, years, months, and time often changed, leaving characters untethered to any time or space. But there is a lyrical quality to the narration so that at times each actor seems to be an instrument in a larger musical score. The characters often tag-team the narration, trading off lines in an impressively choreographed verbal dance. Leila and Lee in particular repeat a shared line whenever they need to be reassured: “Alright. Maybe. Everything will be alright.” When the two travel north on a train, they narrate themselves in third person, speaking in singsong voices as though retelling a fairy tale.
But their story is anything but fairy-like; the themes that thread through the play are serious and add an element of urgency to each character’s self-discovery. “Silent” Leila, as she is dubbed, has a compulsion to cut herself in order to feel like she’s real. Sass, as Leila, delivered her lines with an appropriate flat affect and held herself almost apologetically on the stage, as though she were repentant for being alive. Her skill in portraying a deeply troubled and introverted character was a perfect paradox to Pelton’s bravado as Lee, pompously over-sexualized and yet painfully innocent when he finds himself the murderer of his stepfather. Lee leads Leila haphazardly into the snowy mountains of Scotland where they encounter a frightening “drunk” Frank (Pereira) and Holly (McDuffie), a figment of Leila’s imagination. Each actor brought incredible energy to the narrative, and their chemistry during quiet scenes—sometimes conducted with only the beam of a flashlight to illuminate their faces—almost crackled with authenticity. The incredibly solid and realistic portrayal of the characters made Wolk’s vision even more intriguing. If the director intended the audience to question the reality of every scene, the actors’ honest and emotional performances made it challenging to let go of their apparent reality.
Leila frantically scribbles their tale in chalk on the floor whenever she has time, and in the climactic scene, the other characters erase her words, challenging her version of events. In fact, every character’s existence is so fragile that they, as narrators, are apt to discard their own reality in a few words, as easily as chalk dust is rubbed off the black floor. By the end of the production, Wolk managed both to tell a captivating tale of two teens on the run and to pose a fundamental question about the creation of narrative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
It’s hard to keep a positive attitude when your city is infested with feral dogs and on the verge of liquidating its world-class art museum, but Detroit indie pop duo Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. are doing just fine. Their sophomore release, “The Speed of Things,” is a mostly upbeat affair that largely maintains the vibe of their debut, 2011’s “It’s A Corporate World.”
They may have picked a bad release date, though: compared to recent pop releases by Chvrches, Haim, and Lorde, “The Speed of Things” feels somewhat pedestrian. When Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. manage to string together a good verse and chorus in the same track, it can absolutely hang with those aforementioned acts. However, on “The Speed of Things,” this is the exception, not the rule. Although charming and expertly produced, “The Speed of Things” is ultimately an album with lots of frustratingly inconsistent songs and too few excellent ones.
 
As was the case with “It’s A Corporate World,” the strength of “The Speed of Things” is its top-notch and sonically varied production. From the manic rhythmic shuffle that drives “Mesopotamia” to the swerving, sultry vibes of lead single “If You Didn’t See Me [You Weren’t On the Dancefloor],” the production on “The Speed of Things” is quirky and accessible and thus avoiding the stylistic repetitiveness that can make a lot of pop albums unbearable to listen to in a single sitting. Furthermore, Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. have a great knack for introducing subtle textures that add an extra layer of complexity to their music without crowding it too much--for example, the reverberating guitar lines that amble throughout "Run".
If only they were working with better songs. There are some great songs on “The Speed of Things,” but they’re far outnumbered by great moments in mediocre songs. Inconsistency within songs plagues the album “Don’t Tell Me,” for example, starts off with an infectious, danceable verse, but instead of taking that energy up a level, the stagnant chorus completely stalls its momentum. It’s the same story with “Hiding” and “Knock Louder.” Listen, no one’s expecting “Since U Been Gone,” but pop music’s supposed to be catchy. You’re supposed to want to sing along to it. Instead, “The Speed of Things” is full of melodically conservative choruses that rarely stray outside an octave range.
 
Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. aren’t exactly successful when they try to stray outside the boundaries of pop, either. Most of the non-pop songs on “The Speed of Things” are either derivative or forgettable. For example, “Dark Water,” though not a bad song, shamelessly appropriates Andrew Bird’s trademark whistling and chromatic string accents to such an extent that it becomes incredibly distracting. Elsewhere on the album, the band spends over 10 minutes drudging through the floundering tracks “I Can’t Help It” and “A Haunting” as well as a dreary reprise of album opener “Beautiful Dream.” These songs aren’t necessarily bad because they’re slow; they’re just bad.
 
That being said, when the songs on “The Speed of Things” work, they work really well.  The fantastic “Run” rapidly builds around a high-octane chorus, a delightfully unexpected double key change, and some dark lyrics if you pay attention: “He said: I got a secret room where I can be myself with someone I’ve rented / He said: the only thing that really gets me off is painful enough to feel pleasure.” The aforementioned “If You Didn’t See Me” is one of the best pop songs released in recent memory, striking a strange and wonderful balance between sexy and saccharine.
“The Speed of Things” makes for a frustrating listen, because it feels like it could have been a much better album: it misses a lot of opportunities and squanders a lot of production masterpieces with subpar songwriting. At this pace, though, even if Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. never release a great album, they’re going to have one hell of a greatest hits album by the time they’re done.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a game is on the line, captains must step up. With the Harvard and Cornell men’s soccer teams heading to overtime tied at one on Saturday afternoon, co-captain Kevin Harrington did just that.
“We got into a huddle, and we were going over what we were going to do,” Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer said. “Kevin kind of took hold of the group and said, ‘Play the ball to me. I will get the ball. Just get the ball to me.’ And so we said, ‘Okay.’”
Just over a minute into the second overtime period, Harvard (2-6-2, 1-1 Ivy) earned a free kick 25 yards out deep in the corner of Big Red territory. Co-captain Ross Friedman took the kick and sent a powerful cross into the box. The ball managed to clear the heads of several Big Red (6-3-2, 0-2 Ivy) defenders before dipping right onto the head of Harrington. The co-captain knocked the header into the top corner of the net past Cornell keeper Kurtis Teskoski, stunning the crowd at Berman Field and giving the Crimson a 2-1 victory.
“He wanted the moment, he asked for it, and we just kind of rode him at that point,” Lehrer said.
The upset win over the defending Ivy League champions is the first conference win of the season for Harvard, propelling the team to fourth in the Ancient Eight. The win is the first in three conference seasons for the Crimson, whose two Ivy League tilts have been decided by a combined two goals.
“This was a much-needed win for the team for the program,” Friedman said. “It feels unbelievable. We fought until the end, and that’s something that we’ve struggled with. We’ve been able to fight [for] 85 minutes or 88 minutes, but this time we fought through the full 90 minutes and then all the way through to the second overtime.”
Although according to Friedman, the team fought to the very end, but at the end of regulation, the Crimson looked like it was about to undergo a severe case of déjà vu. Just one week after surrendering two goals in the final three minutes to Yale, the Crimson nearly blew another 1-0 lead late in regulation.
Leading 1-0 in the 82nd minute, the Crimson conceded a foul 35 yards out in its own zone. The ensuing kick was cleared away by the back line, but the ball found its way to Cornell’s Devin Morgan, who sent the ball right back into the box.  Senior defender Jake Kirsch received the cross right in front of the net, and his header beat sophomore Harvard keeper Evan Mendez to tie the game.
Following the equalizer, Cornell pushed forward, looking for the game-winner. In the final five minutes of regulation, the Big Red got three shots off and earned two corners. It appeared as though Cornell had come up with the dagger when the Big Red was able to find the back of the net in the 88th minute, but the goal was called back due to an offsides call.
Nevertheless, Friedman said, the Crimson remained confident heading into the overtime period.
“I could really tell by looking in the huddle, looking at the guys, that we were going to win,” Friedman said. “We weren’t going to leave that game with a tie. We were going to win the game.”
Harvard came out firing in overtime, outshooting the Big Red, 5-0, in the first additional frame. Then, in the second extra period, it only took one shot for Harrington to send the Crimson home victorious.
Harvard played the majority of the game with the lead after an early goal from Friedman. In the 24th minute, senior forward A.J. Agha carried the ball up the wing and sent a pass to Friedman near the corner of the box. Friedman trapped the ball with his chest and struck a low, bending shot that found the inside of the left goalpost for his first goal of the season.
After his one-goal, one-assist performance against Cornell, Friedman has now either scored or assisted the last four goals for the Crimson, and six of the last seven. He had three shots on the night, as did Harrington, junior Matt Sheeleigh, and freshman Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu.
Cornell had a season-high 22 shots in the game. Mendez saved nine of them in net for Harvard, earning his second win of the season.
“When you have someone like Evan who can step in and play at the level he’s playing, it’s phenomenal,” Lehrer said. “He made a couple great saves.”
Friedman says that he is very proud of the team and is confident looking forward.
“That extra push that we had today gave us that win,” Friedman said, “and hopefully we can continue to have that extra push."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite conceding a tying goal with only minutes remaining in Sunday’s contest against Fairfield, the Harvard field hockey team responded in overtime. Behind sophomore Elizabeth Jacobson’s goal with 1:14 left in the extra period, the Crimson (4-5, 0-1 Ivy) defeated the Lady Stags (9-3, 1-0 America East) on Sunday, 4-3.
Harvard had looked poised to emerge victorious in regulation. Awarded a penalty corner with less than five minutes remaining in the second half, Jacobson slung the ball across the circle to freshman Marissa Balleza, who rocketed a shot from the right side of the net to break a 2-2 tie. The first-year’s goal was her fourth of the season, a team-high.
This lead, however, was short-lived. With less than a minute left in regulation, Fairfield senior Hillary Fitz controlled a pass off a corner penalty and drove it into the back of the net, knotting the game at three goals apiece.
Fairfield looked to have won the game in the final seconds of regulation, as junior Felicitas Heinen put a shot past Crimson senior goalkeeper Jen Hattfield. But in the midst of the Lady Stags’ celebration, the referees disallowed the goal, saying that it entered the net too high.
“The momentum shifted a little bit where they thought they won it,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “Our team did very well with staying poised, making the right decision in [overtime] which allowed us to eventually get the win.”
With a man advantage early in overtime, Balleza fired a shot that looked to have beaten freshman goalkeeper Caitlin Bennett, but it ricocheted off the post as the Crimson was unable to take advantage of the Fairfield yellow card.
With the Lady Stags back at even strength, Harvard junior Catriona McDonald was able speed past a few Fairfield defenders and send a pass in to Jacobson, who was able to control the ball and seal the victory for Harvard. McDonald recorded two assists in a winning effort, her first of the year.
“[McDonald] had a great pass,” Jacobson said. “I knew that I had to get [to the middle] to receive it and end the game.”
The victory for the Crimson snapped the Lady Stags’ six-game winning streak. It also marks the first win this at Jordan Field for Harvard, who had lost its previous three games at home.
“We’ve been having trouble getting some goals at home,” senior Rachael Rosenfeld said. “It was really great that we could score a lot of goals and win it at home.”
Rosenfeld opened the scoring for the Crimson with the first half’s only goal, redirecting a shot sent in by McDonald from the top of the circle for her second goal of the season.
Harvard would not stay ahead for long.  Fairfield senior Christy Starsinic dove towards a pass from senior Shealyn Testa in front of the goal, extending her stick out and deflecting the ball into the net 13 minutes into the second half. The Crimson had gone more than 100 minutes without conceding a goal before Starsinic’s effort.
Less than five minutes later, sophomore Emily McCauley scored off a beautiful assist from freshman Julie de Pauew to give the Lady Stags their first lead with less than 20 minutes remaining.
“We still made some mistakes that allowed Fairfield to come back,” van Herwaarden said. “But I think overall we played our game well and it was good enough to get the win.”
Despite losing the lead twice throughout the course of the game, Harvard was able to maintain offensive pressure and eventually come away victorious. The team fired 10 shots on goal during the game, constantly challenging the Lady Stags’ freshman goalkeeper.
Junior Caitlin Rea regained the momentum for the Crimson, scoring off a corner penalty 19:09 into the second half to tie the game, 2-2.
“Once they scored, we trailed off a little bit,” Jacobson said. “After the timeout [after Fairfield’s second goal], we finally got the fire that we needed to pull through.”
Harvard was able to stave off a few Fairfield scoring chances in overtime behind Hattfield’s goalkeeping. She recorded three saves in the game to help slow down a strong Lady Stags’ offense that averages more than three goals per game.
“This year we’re climbing a mountain,” van Henwaarden said. “We’re trying to grow and climb higher every single game. I think today the team set the new standard for what Harvard field hockey is about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Led by the sixth-and 10th-place performances of freshmen Robert Deng and Daniel De La Garza, the Harvard men's golf team tied for fourth at the Temple Invitational in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.
The Crimson finished the first round in second place at 6-over par and only four shots back, but dropped to fourth after shooting a 16-over 296 on Sunday.
“I’m proud of us for getting in contention after the first day,” Deng said. “I think the more times [we’re] in contention, the more times [we] get to experience that pressure of being right there.”
Still in second place with the last five holes to play, the Crimson stumbled to the finish. Harvard shot 10 strokes over par on those final holes to finish at 22-over par, 20 strokes behind first-place Hartford.
De La Garza, who shot the Crimson’s only subpar round of the weekend with a first-round 69 on the par 70, 6,638-yard Philmont Country Club course, was one of the Harvard golfers who struggled through the end of the back nine on Sunday. He shot 3-over par on his final three holes.
“The last few holes, especially the 16th and 17th, were challenging,” De La Garza said. “On 16, you had to hit a very good tee shot, and 17 was a par three where we didn’t really know what the wind was doing, so it was hard to know what [club] to hit.”
None of the other 92 golfers came close to challenging Hartford's Evan Russell for the individual title. Russell overcame a double-bogey on Saturday and a bogey on Sunday at the 16th hole to shoot a 62-68, eight strokes ahead of the pack. He had 14 birdies on the weekend, including ten on Saturday. In the four tournaments he has appeared in this season, Russell now has two victories and a second-place finish.
Russell and teammate Anthony Vecchiarelli were the only competitors to shoot both rounds under par, leading the Hawks to a 2-over par team result. Led by Dylan Crowley's third-place finish at even-par 140, St. John's finished in second with a team score of 577, while the Crimson rounded out the podium at 582.
The next highest Ivy League team was the Penn at 29-over, with Princeton, Cornell, Dartmouth and Brown further down the leaderboard.
Harvard bounced back nicely after coming in 15th out of 16 teams at the Windon Memorial three weeks ago.  This weekend, Deng and De La Garza led the way with scores of 143 and 144 respectively, and every Crimson golfer finished in the top 40 out of 93.
“[Saturday], I felt really good and hit many quality iron shots,” De La Garza said. “My putting was not great, but I was able to hang in there around par and had a good finish. [Sunday] was a completely opposite round—I didn’t hit the ball very well, but was able to putt well.”
While De La Garza saw his score rise on day two, Deng managed to work his way to a solid 1-over par second round after posting a 2-over on Saturday.
“I came into the round feeling positive about my game knowing I could go pretty low [with my score],” Deng said. “I got a couple of bad breaks here and there and found myself at 3-over par through seven [holes], but I was able to stage somewhat of a charge coming back, but near the end a couple of mistakes came back.”
For the rest of the team, the second round was not nearly as strong as the first. Sophomore Rohan Ramnath was consistent with 15 pars on Saturday, but had six bogeys and a double-bogey on Sunday to finish the tournament at 9-over par. Classmate Un Cho shot a 72 in the first round but had no birdies in the second to finish at 8-over 148.
Like the rest of the Crimson, freshman Kendrick Vinar struggled on holes 16 through 18 in both rounds, posting a 4-over par on those three holes. Other than those, though, he managed a 3-over mark and finished at 7-over par for the weekend.
“As a whole, we gave it our best effort this weekend, which is really all we can ask of ourselves,” Deng said. “As we gain more experience, we start to get more clutch, and that’s what we really need right now. At the same time, there’s room for improvement, and fortunately we have next week at the Ivy League Match Play to improve.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 20, freshmen on the Harvard women’s tennis team played their first competitive collegiate matches at the Tribe Invitational at William & Mary. This past weekend, with just under a month of experience, they proved that they could compete just as well as their more seasoned teammates at the Billie Jean King Invitational in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.
Freshman Spencer Liang, the top seed in Flight A, had an undefeated run in her draw of 16. She cruised through her first two matches in straight sets before posting a 6-3, 6-0 win against Rutgers’ Vanessa Petrini in the semi-final round. Sivan Krems, from Princeton, gave Liang a more challenging time in the title match when she took the first set, 6-4. Liang had to win the second set 6-4 before progressing to the third set tiebreak, where she bested Krems 10-4.
Classmate Monica Lin mirrored Liang’s performance in her own draw. Advancing to the final round in straight sets, she overcame unseeded Tina Jiang 5-7, 6-3, 10-6, to take first place. Jiang, who hails from Columbia, beat Harvard’s Amy He in a quarter-final upset before progressing onto the semis. There, she won 6-4, 6-2, against second seed Dorothy Tang before falling to Lin.
“I was very proud of the way our team competed this weekend, and it was definitely a step up from our performance at William and Mary,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “I think we’re getting better every week, so it’s [nice] to see the improvement.”
Continuing the pattern of success, rookie June Lee—seeded first in her draw, like Liang and Lin—also advanced to the final, where she won 7-5, 6-2, against third seed Angeles de los Rios. Lee edged Bryant’s Marion Bouillin in a tight three-set quarter final, but besides that one set back managed to win all her other matches in straight sets.
“I was really, really excited,” Lee said. “It was just nice to represent Harvard and have a good tournament.”
The only remaining freshman player from Harvard—Danielle Mirda—managed to advance to the semi-finals of her flight before falling to first seed Gabriela Srodowski.
Apart from the freshmen, Junior Sylvia Li and captain Hannah Morrill competed in their respective single draws, as well as in the third overall double’s draw. In singles, Li lost to second seed Caroline Joyce 5-7, 4-6, after she advanced to the semifinal round, while Morrill reached the final but was unable to prevail over Texas-Arlington’s Gaida D’Ortona. Morrill fell in three thrilling sets, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6, concluding in a tie-break which D’Ortona won 10-7.
The Crimson duo, however, won first place in doubles against Lolade Ogungbesan and Molly Wickman, 8-3. Such a performance, as well as a the performances of the rest of Harvard’s competitors, reveal a more experienced team leading up to next week’s ITA Regionals, hosted by the Crimson.

In one of his first public appearances since withdrawing his name from Fed Chair consideration, former University President Larry Summers came out swinging against the Thiel Fellowship, a controversial scholarship created by entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter A. Thiel.
 
Summers called the Fellowship, which grants $100,000 to 17 to 20-year-olds who leave college to start a company, “the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade,” according to technology news website TechCrunch.
 
With the tagline “Some Ideas Just Can’t Wait,” the Thiel Fellowship’s website states that the scholarship allows bright students to pursue their own work, research, and “self-education,” along with providing access to mentors in a variety of fields.
 
Thiel was the first outside investor in Facebook, founded by Harvard drop-out Mark Zuckerberg, and the Fellowship’s supporters have pointed to other drop-outs, such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as visionaries who changed the world without a college degree.
 
The site touts the slogan that, with the Fellowship, “Rather than just studying, you’re doing.”
 
But Summers said that the Silicon Valley titans who dropped out of college are the exception, not the rule.
“I think it’s hard to look back and say it’s a sad thing that Bill Gates dropped out of college—world’s OK, he’s OK,” Summers said, according to TechCrunch. “I think it’s a hard thing to say that it’s sad that Mark Zuckerberg dropped out of college. But they are extraordinary exceptions, and if any significant number of intellectually able people—of the kind that would have the opportunity to attend top schools—are dropping out, I think it’s tragic.”
 
 
 
 
Varsity recruiting season is in full swing. In recent weeks, high school athletes have been shadowing varsity athletes across campuses nationwide. In this Q&A, three Ivy League coaches provide their perspectives on official recruiting visits and offer a few tips to prospective student-athletes.
Kathy Delaney-Smith has coached the Harvard women’s basketball team for 31 seasons, accumulating 11 Ivy League titles. Jim Henry took the reins of the Yale women’s swimming and diving team last season after leading the University of Texas to three Big 12 titles as an associate head coach. Mike Way has coached the Crimson’s men’s and women’s squash programs to multiple individual and team titles during his three seasons in Cambridge.
How do you decide which potential recruits to invite to a recruiting weekend?
Coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, Harvard Women’s Basketball: There’s a million things [we consider]. Obviously, the basketball comes first. You find the players you like and the positions you need. Then you collect transcripts all year long—sophomore year, junior year. Then you go watch them play in tournaments, and talk to their high school coach, their AAU coach, their parents and them.You find out if there’s mutual interest, and then sometimes there’s a home visit, sometimes not. We offer campus visits to anyone who fits our needs and is mutually interested in us.
Coach Jim Henry, Yale Women’s Swimming and Diving: You want to look at three different areas. You want to look at athletic potential, you want to look at academic potential and success, and then you want to look at character… It’s not always about where their times are now. I know that in swimming, it’s very easy to look at a piece of paper and a ranking of where someone is currently. We want to look for who is going to be in that ranking in the future… And this is not an easy process, but it’s also predicting who you feel is motivated to do the work in the academic setting like Yale to get better. Those are tough questions to answer, and a lot of it is on a hunch, and a lot of it is on background work.
We probably start with 300 people in the class, and that’s probably cut down to about 150 because of their academics. From those 150, that’s probably chopped down to 75 because of where their times are or what range of swimmer they might be. So of those 75 which we start with on July 1 [the first day swimming and diving coaches can call rising high school senior recruits], we try to figure which 18 could come to campus in September so that they could decide in October.
Coach Mike Way, Squash: For us, we have to troll around the world. We’re pulling in kids from Egypt, Europe. We’ve got a couple kids coming from the U.K., from France, from India. So we literally have to do our homework. The second point is that [we need to make sure] these international kids who have the academics aware that they can come and play college squash over here. Some of them, they may be very bright and have good transcripts, but they’ve never even heard of the SAT. So sometimes that’s a bit of a roadblock.
What are your greatest concerns leading up to and during a recruiting weekend?
Delaney-Smith: There’s all kinds of very formal stuff that other schools do and maybe a lot of the Harvard teams do. They’ll want to impress them with an academic person and a dean and an athletic director—the whole host of people. While I think that has some value, I think that the best value for us, our sport and our philosophy is [the recruits] get a feel and knowledge for the people on our team and a feel and knowledge for the student body at Harvard. I think trying to impress them with professors and stuff like that is silly. The most important thing we’re concerned about is that [the recruits] know what our team is like here, what the student body is like here, and what the student life is like here. That’s our hope.
Henry: My greatest concern is that the visiting recruits can get a true picture of what our team is like in a short window of time… More than anything, I want to make sure they’re taken care of and that they have the opportunity to learn what a true day in the life of a student-athlete at Yale is. I’m always concerned about safety; I’m also always concerned about following the rules. We have moved to a dry policy… I’ve always talked about it, but this is the first year we’ve actually implemented a rule, and it went incredibly well. It was incredibly well-received. I don’t believe that [drinking] should be the deciding factor of why [a recruit] should decide to go to a school. It’s on college campuses; it’s part of our society, but it’s not something that I want them to make their decision based off of.
Way: The biggest concern when they’re on campus is just making sure that they have a good time but it doesn’t get carried away. We’ve just got to make sure that they’re safe. And if they’re coming from different cultures, the players on the team are aware of that and respectful of whatever their background is, vis a vis a normal undergraduate’s life on the weekend.
[Another] concern with every coach is that with the whole recruiting thing, sometimes these kids can make a quick decision based on a small incident. Harvard should always be up there for any smart kid who wants to play sport in America, how could Harvard not be on their radar. The kid wants to like the players, he wants to like the coach, he wants to feel like he can fit in. And apart from that, we just pray it doesn’t rain all weekend (laughs).
What do you think is the most important thing for a recruit to know going into an official visit?
Delaney-Smith: I always like them to know how they fit into our team—what strengths they have that we liked about them. I’d say we have a reputation for being pretty honest recruiters. I always say to everybody, ‘If Harvard isn’t the right match for you, I’d love to see you in the Ivy League.’ It’s a great league to compete in. I like communication and honesty. Unfortunately, it sometimes fails; that’s the piece [of recruiting] that I don’t care for.  I don’t have to sell Harvard, I don’t have to sell my program. It’s obvious that it’s a great opportunity for someone.
Henry: Recruiting trips can be one of two things: they can be reality or they can be a show. And what I try to tell [recruits] is that what they’re getting is nothing special. They’re going to the dining halls that they would go to eat in. They are staying in the residential houses that they would stay in next year, they’re going to the classes that they would go to next year… The reality is that they are seeing what the team is really like…
More than anything [recruits] have to ask questions, and they have to get the information that they need. Because it is vital that not only do they listen to the information and see the information, they have to feel what’s really going on, and they have to use their senses so that they’re collecting enough information to make a great decision.
Way: The most important thing is that they have a good interview. So from that perspective, again, we have to do a little work with the student-athlete because if they are obsessive about their sport, they’re not what Harvard is looking for. You’re probably aware of the classic question that is known as “the broken leg question.” The student-athlete needs not only to be able to answer the questions not just eloquently and articulately but [also] to be able to talk about their sport in the broader sense of their experiences. How did they balance sports and studying, and what did they learn from their travels outside the realm of competing?
What are your interactions with recruits during their visit?
Delaney-Smith: I will have a breakfast with [all the visiting recruits] to welcome them and talk a little bit about what their itinerary is and what their interview with admissions is like. And in our sport—this is not true in all sports but it our sport—the parents always come. So we have to host families as well usually.
I try to meet with each [recruit] individually to talk about them and how they’d fit it. For them, it’s important that they play with our team to get a feel and a sense. Coaches are not there, so I am not part of that. And then we’ll take the parents out to dinner.
I evaluate them insofar as how they fit in with my team, what my team felt about them, [and] how disciplined or not disciplined were they. There have been a number of recruits who came here, and we lost them. They went partying and drinking, and they’d come off my list.
Henry: It’s extremely important that I spend some one-on-one time with [the recruits] to make sure they know where they fit within the plan as far as moving forward. I don’t want them to think that there is not a plan for them. I go into detail about where the program is going, why we do what we do, how we train, what I’m looking for. And they ask their personal questions, because all of them have different questions—some of them it’s about swimming, some of them it’s about Yale, some of them is about the  process. So I set up one-on-one meetings with them to make sure that those questions are taken care of.
But the other thing I do after they go home is that I make sure to follow up with my team to find out whether or not it’s a good fit for us. Because I trust my team and that they know what type of student is going to be successful at Yale—and it is “student,” and I want to make sure they have that focus first.
Way: When they come on campus, we [coaches] sit down with each of them for at least an hour, and we just talk about them as people. We don’t just ask the questions; we do a practice admissions interview. We get them to talk about themselves. Because, obviously, the interview is not for a job; it’s about who are they. Are they a fit on the team, and, as importantly, are they a fit at Harvard?
