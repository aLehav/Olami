After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CAMBRIDGE, MA — I have been thinking about organ meats a lot this summer because I have been thinking about my grandfather, who was recently diagnosed with rapidly progressing dementia.
My grandparents grew up in a rural part of Hunan province, in southern China, where most of my extended family still lives. My grandfather and his five siblings grew up farming sweet potatoes for a living. Only one of them could go to school, and all they had to eat was sweet potatoes — and the occasional chicken that had to be slowly rationed out.
My grandfather was the only one who left the farm. He wasn’t the one my great-grandparents initially decided to send to school, but he stood outside the schoolhouse every day and listened in, and eventually replaced his older brother. Later, he became a doctor, and moved to a mid-sized town three hours away, where he and my grandmother would raise three children, and live up until today.
***
When I was younger, one of my favorite parts of visiting China was when my grandfather taught me about the chickens. They would always slaughter a chicken when my family visited, and I would help him prepare the chicken for cooking while he taught me how all the organs functioned. We ate all the parts we could eat, in various dishes. My favorite was gizzard and liver, stir-fried with super spicy hot peppers.
This summer, I’m here in Cambridge, renting a room above Porter Square. I spend a lot of time walking and biking and grocery shopping for ingredients I’ve never tried before and finding buy-two-get-two-free ice cream deals. I sweat outside and at home and freeze in a jacket in the Northwest Building and then sweat again and freeze again. And I have been teaching myself how to cook all the organ meats — and all the other inexpensive animal parts — I can find in Cambridge supermarkets.
One day in June, I decide to cook a cow tongue from Market Basket. I watch instructional YouTube videos. I tell my mom. She responds, “Alicia, you need a pressure cooker! Like an Instant Pot.” I don’t have an Instant Pot, so I find a four-hour period where I’m at home, and I simmer the tongue with onion, garlic, scallions, and bay leaf before I peel and slice it. I serve it with stir-fried vegetables and rice, and send pictures to my family group chat.
“Why are you doing this?” my mom says. “It’s so complicated. You’re picking the hardest things to cook. Do you have that much time?”
I don’t have an answer. Maybe it’s because the less-used animal parts are delicious, cheaper, and more nutritionally dense. Maybe it’s because it’s something new to try. There’s a sort-of beauty about wasting nothing and using all the animal parts you can use, even though buying packaged liver from Market Basket is very different from what my grandfather taught me. I’m not sure.
On July 4, after I see some friends, I bike for 15 miles, alone, around the empty Cambridge streets. I end up on Memorial Drive, and I stop at the bridge between MIT and Back Bay, sit for a bit, and then skip the fireworks to bike home. I stop by H Mart on the way and pick up a three-dollar package of pork leg bones. I make a huge pot of spicy soup. I save the bone marrow and use it to flavor some fried rice a few days later. Maybe this is how my grandfather would have done it.
I miss learning from my grandfather about chicken anatomy and organ meats. Years later, not much and everything has changed: I’m still spending much of my time learning from people who know a lot more than me. I run experiments in my lab, and also run experiments in my kitchen. I am now 20 years old, about to be a junior at a college with resources my grandparents never knew of. My grandfather no longer knows who I am.
Every day, here, I am surrounded by things that were not available to him. But it’s also the other way around, in a distorted way. I know sweet potatoes as a health food, but he was malnourished from eating them every day. He instead considered organs healthy, but now we say that liver is high in cholesterol. I want to own chickens after I graduate for fresh eggs, but my grandfather owned them out of necessity. Maybe, by spending hours cooking food I do not know how to cook, I am trying to get closer to the parts of my grandfather I no longer have access to. I know that it’s far from the same thing. Is this okay? I don’t know, either.
My parents and I moved to the United States when I was young, and I never learned how to speak my grandparents’ dialect. I saw them only once every few summers, for a period of two or so weeks. All sacrifices my parents made, in search of a better future. Before he forgot who I was, my grandfather said that he was proud of me.
I stir fry chicken gizzard in hot pepper sauce with the vent fan in my kitchen turned all the way up, and think about my family.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council took the first step to pass an amendment to its surveillance ordinance to ban the use of facial recognition city-wide during its annual summer meeting Tuesday.
The council voted unanimously to forward the amendment, which was introduced by Cambridge City Mayor Marc C. McGovern, to the Public Safety Committee for a hearing in the coming months.
The proposed amendment states that the use of facial recognition surveillance technology can have a “chilling effect” on constitutional rights and typically have error rates that disproportionately affect racial minorities. The amendment argues that the “potential threats” to residents’ civil rights and civil liberties warrant an outright ban of facial recognition technology. The Somerville City Council passed a similar law in June.
If passed, the amendment will be added to a surveillance ordinance passed in December that requires the city manager to gain approval from the city council before acquiring or using new surveillance technologies.
In a July interview, McGovern said he has worked with many government officials and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts to ensure public safety is “not compromised” in surveillance laws.
The ACLU of Massachusetts wrote in a statement Tuesday that it is grateful for the city council's efforts to ban facial recognition surveillance technology.
“People should be able to walk around Cambridge, attend protests, seek medical treatment, and visit friends and family without worrying that government agencies are keeping tabs on their every movement,” wrote Kade Crockford, the organization's director of its Technology for Liberty program.
At Tuesday's meeting, which did not conclude until midnight, the council also discussed the ongoing process to regulate recreational marijuana shop permitting in Cambridge. The council picked up discussion from a June Ordinance Committee meeting, during which they debated two opposing amendments — one introduced by Councilor E. Denise Simmons and another by Councilors Sumbul Siddiqui and Quinton Y. Zondervan.
Siddiqui and Zondervan's amendment would bar anyone who is not from a historically marginalized background from opening a recreational marijuana shop in Cambridge for the next two years. Simmons’ amendment would allow current registered medical marijuana dispensaries to begin selling recreational marijuana if they contribute to a fund for minority owned businesses.
“We have been trying to find our way to making sure that if people have equal opportunity in the billion dollar business of cannabis. In that conversation, it is so important to keep patients in the front of this conversation,” Simmons said.
Siddiqui said during the meeting that the council had a “moral imperative” to pass legislation and said she hopes the council will reach a “true compromise.”
The council ultimately decided to hold another meeting for further debate.
On the subject of affordable housing, the council deferred discussion of a proposed zoning reform to the next Ordinance Committee meeting. The proposal would incentivize affordable housing developers and amend zoning regulations to expedite the approval process and reduce costs.
The council also addressed other city issues at the meeting such as the deteriorating condition of the Edward J. Sullivan Courthouse and the expansion of an Eversource Electric power substation.
Nearly three of the meeting’s six hours comprised of public testimony on a range of topics, though many focused on affordable housing and recreational marijuana.
The affordable housing overlay, which is widely supported by the council, came under attack by several residents. Patricia “Patty” M. Nolan ’80 said she believed a more “in-depth” analysis of alternatives should have been implemented in the drafting of the policy.
“It would be irresponsible not to have reviewed in depth a number of options prior to adopting a city wide zoning change,” said Nolan, who is running for a City Council seat in the November election.
Skip Schloming, another Cambridge resident, said he had concerns about the potential of “bulkier buildings” and reductions of green space and parking if the reform were passed.
Denise A. Valenti, a Quincy, Mass. resident, testified that the council’s recreational marijuana proposals are exclusionary and will hurt many businesses.
“Diversity defined in the cannabis regulations is very exclusive,” she said.
In response to some of the public testimony, McGovern defended the length of time that the council has allocated to discussions about recreational marijauana before passing legislation, specifically regarding "Economic Empowerment" permit applicants.
“For anyone to be suggesting that this council is, however we vote, is somehow against [Economic Empowerment] applicants, please spare me,” McGovern said. “We are breaking ground here and that's hard to do, but we're having these conversations because we can and we're being thoughtful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University of California, Berkeley alleged in documents submitted Tuesday to the US Patent and Trademark Office that the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT employed “deceit” to win patent rights to CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells.
The documents were filed as part of UC Berkeley's motions list, which represents the first step in proceedings initiated by the USPTO in June to settle priority issues between 10 patent applications filed by UC Berkeley in 2018 and 13 patents previously awarded to the Broad Institute.
The dispute originated in 2011 and 2012, when Jennifer A. Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle M. Charpentier of Umeå University in Sweden were researching CRISPR-Cas9. Simultaneously, Feng Zhang ’04 of the Broad Institute was working on the same problem, albeit separately.
CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that scientists say has revolutionary potential applications in the biomedical sphere, including helping to cure genetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis.
Though Doudna published her findings and applied for a patent before Zhang did, her work focused on CRISPR-Cas 9 in test tubes whereas Zhang’s research focused on its usage in human and mouse cells. The USPTO awarded the Broad Institute rights to use CRISPR-Cas9 for eukaryotic cell-editing methods in 2014.
Most of CRISPR’s potential industrial and commercial applications concern its use in higher order, eukaryotic cells.
The documents filed Tuesday by UC Berkeley claim that — “in pattern of deception” — Zhang and other Broad scientists presented “cherry-picked data” and “materially misstated facts” in order to prove an earlier date of invention.
“Broad withheld or misrepresented material information with the intent to deceive the Office, in order to secure allowance of the involved patents,” the UC Berkeley lawyers stated in their list of intended motions.
The documents cited a 2015 email sent to Doudna from Shuailiang Lin, one of Zhang’s former lab members.
“My lab notebooks, emails and other files like dropbox or gel pictures recorded every step of the lab's failure process. I am willing to give more details and records if you are interested or whoever is interested to clear the truth,” Lin wrote, according to the document.
The Broad Institute wrote in a statement on its website that UC Berkeley’s claims are “baseless” and do not supplant the lack of “any actual evidence of UC’s work in eukaryotic cells.”
“The UC repeats its previous false claim around an email from a student with an expiring visa who emailed Dr. Doudna seeking a job and promising information. The student was hired by the UC system within days. The email was inaccurate and contrary to all records,” the statement read.
The Broad added that UC Berkeley’s choice of tactics was “deeply unfortunate.”
“It is time for all institutions to move beyond litigation and instead work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology,” the statement concluded.
Both the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley have licensed CRISPR-related patents to for-profit companies. After the patent office’s 2017 decision, Editas — the Broad Institute’s commercial surrogate and primary licensee of CRISPR — went up in value from $765 million to $1 billion, according to Forbes. A patent for CRISPR-Cas9 is valued at approximately $265 million.
This round of litigation will continue in a conference call between the two parties on August 5, according to legal documents.
