After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Nathaniel Is Irrelevant” isn’t the strongest episode of the season, but that’s probably because it has a lot of loose ends to tie up. In the Season Three finale of “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” Nathaniel (Scott Michael Foster) has to come to terms with his one-sided relationship, Darryl (Pete Gardner) needs to resolve the awkward aftermath of his breakup with White Josh (David Hull), and Heather (Vela Lovell) has to give birth.
But throughout it all, Rachel Bloom’s brainchild stays lovingly subversive with zany and self-aware musical numbers. We get a wonderful three minutes of Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin) singing atop a flower-studded throne while wearing a matching persimmon-colored chiffon dress. “Tear, tear, tear / goes your vagina,” she blissfully sings. “Never will it be / its cute little self again / But the good news is / if you have a few more kids / the rest will basically / plop right out.” It’s got the gracious musical irony that’s become a “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” trademark, and will hopefully immortalize itself along with the episode’s second number: “Nothing is Ever Anyone’s Fault,” Rebecca (Rachel Bloom) and Nathaniel’s hilarious power ballad. “So it’s not my fault that / my parents messed me up,” they belt. “‘Cause their parents messed them up / And Adam and Eve were messed up by God / who was originally messed up by the Big Bang.”
“Nothing is Ever Anyone’s Fault” smashes the tragic backstory narrative crutch, but the finale also makes waves with Heather’s nonexistent birth scene. It’s almost a given at this point that in any show, if there’s a pregnant character, the season must end with them giving birth in some overwritten, overused, dramatic manner. I was secretly hoping that “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” was too smart to fall for that trope, and that they would just push Heather’s pregnancy off to a later season or have the birth happen off screen. But the show does even better: It takes the cliché and looks at it head-on. “I can’t believe how calm you are,” Darryl says. “On TV shows, pregnant women—they’re always crying, and screaming, and punching their husband in the face.”
“Yea, well, those shows were written by men,” Heather retorts. “I got an epidural remember? I don’t feel a thing.” It’s so satisfying seeing “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” laugh at stereotypes and actually create scenes that are all the more compelling without them. Most of Heather’s hospital moments are of her being her charmingly dry and charismatic self while doing crossword puzzles. After she has her baby, the show cuts to a shot of her glowing with sweat and pride: “Man. I killed that,” she says.
This jumpcut cleverly takes place right after Rebecca nearly did kill someone. What eclipses all of these subplots is how Rebecca continuously diverts the responsibility of her own actions. This behavior ultimately threatens her relationship with her best friend, Paula. In the previous episode, Rebecca lied to Paula in order to coerce her into a committing a federal crime. The guilt catches up to Rebecca in the finale, manifesting as a hallucination of her male doppelganger, Trent. She confesses to Paula under the pressure, and it becomes clear that the nearly-invincible friendship that has weathered three seasons of obsessive romances and questionable escapades may not survive this storm.
Champlin’s performance conveys much of the finale’s tension. Watching her wrestle with anger, hurt, and grief is like watching an exercise in restraint: Champlin doesn’t wildly gesture. She doesn’t yell. She doesn’t rely on dramatics. She barely even cries. Any tears remain suspended—just like the tension in the scene. It’s this stillness that is especially frightening and real—a true testament to Champlin’s acting ability.
After this gut-wrenching scene, Rebecca has to grapple with the culpability of her actions. In addition to lying to her best friend, Rebecca has also ordered a hit on her ex’s girlfriend, threatened the safety of another ex’s mother, and in the season finale, she pushes real Trent off a building (to be fair, Trent was about to kill someone else). Up until now, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” has wanted us to chalk up all of Rebecca’s dangerous behavior to her Borderline Personality Disorder. But the finale pulls a twist. After nearly killing Trent (he falls into a pool), Rebecca goes to court. Under Nathaniel’s instructions, she’s to plead not guilty by reason of insanity.
But she doesn’t. “I’m sorry. I can’t do this,” she says. “I may have Borderline, but I’m not insane. I’m responsible for everything that happened—all of it.” In this scene, “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” immediately subverts the “tragic backstory explains all bad things” trope that plagues modern-day storytelling. “It’s my life, and I’m responsible no matter what illness I have, or what my parents were like,” she continues. “And let’s be clear—they suck.”
Rebecca’s courtroom monologue is touching, but it’s unclear whether or not it can neatly unpack all of the moral gray area the show has set up. Rebecca claims the necessity for responsibility amid differing circumstances almost too quickly, and it feels like there’s still more to talk about: Are all actions inexcusable, despite the circumstances? Does this gloss over and ignore the complicated landscape those with mental illnesses have to live through? Or does it hold everyone to a necessary moral standard?
There are no easy answers to these questions, but judging by the strong set of actors and writers the show has in tow, there may be a fourth season to answer them. So here’s to hoping for a renewal, for more trope and stereotype destruction, and for more brilliantly funny, subversive, visceral work by the team behind “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.”

Tomi Adeyemi’s “Children of Blood and Bone” is an enthralling tale that will revolutionize the perceptions of YA and fantasy literature. The young adult fantasy novel follows Zélie Adebola, a young woman who tries to restore magic to her home. Her snow white hair and dark skin are signs of the magic that runs through her veins, but also solidify her status as a second-class citizen within her nation of Orïsha. The magic has been gone for years and the old maji, including her mother, were mass murdered by the monarchy. After a run-in with a curious scroll and Amari, the crown princess of Orïsha, Zélie may have the chance to bring the magic back. Hunted by royal guards, Zélie journeys across Orïsha to restore its magic and save her people. The novel’s rich worldbuilding based on African cultural tradition is a refreshing departure from the standard Tolkien fantasy and cements Adeyemi as an author revolutionizing the fantasy genre.
Adeyemi’s characters are a breath of fresh air for readers of young adult fiction. Zélie, Amari, and Inan, the captain of the guard and crown prince of Orïsha, alternatively narrate the novel. These characters first appear as overwhelmingly self-absorbed YA tropes. Zélie carries unwarranted animosity towards everyone she meets, a common stereotype for feisty female YA protagonists. Amari is the confused princess, unaccustomed to the world outside her palace walls. Inan is the archetypal angst-ridden teen torn between the expectations of his cold father and his hormonal fascination with the renegade Zélie. Yet by the end of the novel, these characters transform from flimsy YA tropes to matured adolescents who understand their decisions have fatal costs. When Zélie considers sharing magic for the first time, her childhood hopes for the joy and beauty it could bring is replaced with “the pain that could lie in [the new maji’s] wake: Grounder ripping the earth under our feet; Reapers... losing control and unleashing waves of death.” Adeyemi tracks Zélie’s transformation particularly well, documenting her transition from a shallow protagonist to an authentic female protagonist that deserves to be at the center of the story. The trials, losses, and successes that the characters face serve as teaching points for the main characters.
“Children of Blood and Bone” poses a reality uncommon in the YA genre. In particular,  the world of Orïsha is extraordinarily violent. It is riven with strife, hatred, and genocide, and Adeyemi does not shirk away from portraying them. She does not spare her characters from hurt or pain and does not grant immortality to anyone. Rather, Adeyemi will intimately describe and elicit empathy for a character on one page and kill them on the next. This willingness to kill characters leaves no plot twist off the table and creates an addicting high-stakes narrative. Losses and failures are real, but there are moments of happiness and beauty, light-hearted banter, blossoming romances, and strength. Adeyemi shows the temporary moments of joy in struggle: “The children of Orïsha dance like there is no tomorrow, each step praising the gods. Their mouths glorify the rapture of liberation, their hearts sing the Yoruba songs of freedom….They seem to light up the air with their delight—it's like the whole world can breathe again." The struggles in life, she argues, serve to make the joys that much sweeter.
Along with Adeyemi’s new take on young adult literature, “Children of Blood and Bone” has placed itself in the revolution of fantasy literature. The work moves the fantasy genre away from the reign of Tolkien and eurocentric worldbuilding in fantasy that have lasted for almost a century. Orïsha is a world steeped in African culture and mythology, which bleeds through every paragraph of the work from the very first page: “I think about the way her dark skin glowed like the summer sun, the way her smile made Baba come alive. The way her white hair fuzzed and coiled, an untamed crown that breathed and thrived.” Use of the Yoruba language, the novel’s allusions to West African cuisine (shuku shuku and jollof rice), and the vibrant displays of worship and community affirm that Adeyemi’s work is unapologetically African. Into this context she weaves an inspiring and immersive epic fantasy of hope and bravery. Adeyemi rebuffs the common trend of fantasy to exclusively focus on European cultures and mythologies and proves that fantasy is universal. “Children of Blood and Bone” shows that fantasy excels in worlds with a rich and vibrant African flair.
However, Adeyemi struggles at times to balance plot progression and worldbuilding in her writing and occasionally reverts to front-loading the exposition when details could be gradually incorporated into the storyline. For other aspects of her world, Adeyemi leaves the reader completely in the dark. Much of the specialized language is not directly explained, and that leaves the reader with the conflicting feelings of being hit over the head with exposition in one area and grasping for basic information in another.
The success of “Children of Blood and Bone” should not be judged independently of its evolutionary consequences on YA and fantasy literature. In writing of vibrant worlds and intriguing black characters, Adeyemi presents a fantasy with non-European influences. It is a shift in perspective that readers have been waiting to see for a long time. The novel is a gripping tale of a trio’s journey to restoring magic and maturing in the process. It is a work that will hopefully serve as an example that the fantasy genre is a place where stories of all kind can not only be told, but be told well.

Junot Díaz wants you to know what children’s books can do. His first venture into the genre, “Islandborn,” follows a young girl named Lola as she tries to remember the Island, the country she left as a baby. She tracks details through memories from family and friends, all of which are vividly illustrated by Leo Espinosa in brightly colored pages—that is, until a dark, shadowy “Monster” interrupts Lola’s cheerful narrative.
“I was hoping this book wouldn’t just be a comment on little Lola and her lovely family and this larger island community from which she comes,” Díaz says. “I was hoping it would also be something of a dialogue about what children’s literature is capable of.” Children’s books are no strangers to monsters or antagonists, the building blocks to many self-sustaining plots. Under Díaz’s pen, the Monster of “Islandborn” comes to represent larger political implications.
“For me, the Monster represents the savage, traumatic histories from which many of us immigrants emerge—a history that is often erased or silenced within our communities and inside of the community in which we find ourselves,” Díaz says. “It’s a common injury that many immigrant communities wrestle with.”
The Monster of “Islandborn” is a large, bat-like creature. In its first appearance, it flies above a wave that threatens to encapsulate the Island. For those familiar with Díaz’s work, the parallels between the Island and the Dominican Republic are overt: between the Monster’s 30 years of havoc and Rafael Trujillo’s 31 years of dictatorship, and between the wave and Hurricane San Zenon, the natural disaster that prompted Trujillo to place the nation under martial law and rebuild Santo Domingo under a new name—Ciudad Trujillo (Trujillo City). But Díaz makes no explicit references to what the Monster could represent: The monster is simply called “the Monster,” just as the island is called “the Island.”
This ambiguity is intentional. “One wants to offer up opportunities for readers. I think that you want readers to participate in the text, and therefore the monster can be read multiplicitously,” Díaz says. “I would argue it’s part of being fair to your reader, but also that even within one specific community the political monstrosities I’m talking about don’t land on us equally. I think that for me it’s far easier to have a symbolic representation than an explicit one.”
At one point in “Islandborn,” Lola’s grandmother sees Lola’s drawing of the Monster, and grows still. “Abuela, did you know about the Monster?” Lola asks her. “Of course, hija. Why do you think so many of us are here in the North?” It’s a moment that could be a manifestation of cultural trauma, but Díaz says he wants readers to make their own evaluations about the book.
“I would hate to over-authorize any particular reading. I would simply say that if you finish this book, by the time you get to the end, you have to read a lot of incidents and characters completely differently,” Díaz says. “I would make the claim that you can’t read the innocuous interactions in the first three quarters of the book quite the same way once you understand what’s lurking behind them.”
Despite these potentially dark undertones, most of “Islandborn” is filled with vibrant illustrations describing Lola’s own journey in finding the Island. The Monster only makes visual appearances on three spreads out of 48 pages. In its second, it sinks into the sea, eclipsed by a chain of people holding hands in an act of defiance: “Heroes rose up. Strong smart young women just like you, Lola, and a few strong smart young men, too.”
“One of the trends we see in children’s writing, in children, is that they’re more emotionally robust, more narratively resilient than adults imagine them to be. And again, I always think the politics of innocence don’t serve our communities well,” Díaz says. “If you’re a person of color, if you’re a person of African-descent, if you’re an immigrant—all these things I am—these politics of innocence that structure children’s literature in some ways do us more harm than they do us good. They erase or they discourage realities and reckonings without which those of us who are members of these communities cannot come to a real understanding of who we are.”
Díaz argues that some amount of realism—despite its somber nature—is necessary and, perhaps, liberating. “Is Lola more integrated, more empowered, and more full of joy before her realization that the Island is haunted by the Monster,” Díaz asks. “Or after?”
The monster makes its third and final appearance on the last page of “Islandborn.” Lola opens her book of drawings, “and out burst[s] the Island” in a flurry of sunshine, music, and smiling faces and animals. And warriors—young women like Lola—who battle the Monster into the corner of the page, away from their home and into the ocean.

With Spring Break coming up faster than those too-old chocolates from Valentine’s Day, you’re sure to be clocking in some quality couch time. What better to get you relaxed and ready for vacation than some lighthearted, nostalgic Disney classics? As a nice throwback into your childhood, here are the Top 5 Disney musicals.
5. “Tangled” (2010)
This often tongue-in-cheek spin on the timeless tale of Rapunzel wins major points for its self-aware humor, ambitious and independent heroine, and incredibly catchy and smart soundtrack. Flynn Rider, Rapunzel’s rapscallion of a love interest, is a sarcastic and devilishly handsome variation on the often stoic or uncreative princes that frequently accompany the princesses (or other leading ladies) of fairy tales. The animation is artful, and the recurring motif of light can be interpreted both as a visual amuse bouche or as a deeper metaphor for the triumph of good over evil. However, “Tangled” lacks the endearing, two dimensional simplicity of older Disney films and does little to challenge the tropes of the genre in a meaningful way. Still, “Tangled” succeeds by appealing to the timeless themes of family, identity, and friendships against all odds.
4. “The Little Mermaid” (1989)
Who doesn’t love a gal whose primary form of hygiene is also a food utensil? Well, Ariel of “The Little Mermaid” has illustrated to multiple generations the value of creativity with her use of a fork as a hairbrush. Many have grown up with the image of her singing passionately atop a jagged rock, her fiery, fork-combed locks blowing behind her. This scene also occurs during what is arguably the most iconic theme song of the genre, “Part of Your World.” This mainstream classic is a childhood favorite and adulthood staple of many. 
3. “Hercules” (1997)
Don’t tell the Classics majors that this less-than-accurate depiction of Ancient Greek lore ranked so high! Hercules is the first protagonist on this list who is certifiably not a princess, and much of the movie centers around the rich development of his character arc, from lost and awkward youngling to… no spoilers—although it’s safe to say that you’ve had several thousand years to find out the ending. Hercules is everything from vulnerable to enraged to sensitive to downright violent. Our hero’s tale is supported thoroughly by an innovative, gospel-style soundtrack replete with vocal runs and no shortage of sass from the narrating Nine Muses. And let’s not forget Megara! Hercules’ sassy, smart love interest turns the tables on him in more than one way, which can be very refreshing. All in all, Hercules is a hilarious and emotional depiction of one hero’s path to self-discovery. 
2. “Mulan” (1998)
Here we have another questionably accurate historical narrative, but this time, it is nothing short of a masterpiece. “Mulan” has it all, from stunning two-dimensional animation to iconic numbers such as “I’ll Make A Man Out Of You.” But perhaps best of all is the movie’s namesake heroine. Starting with its beginning scene with the matchmaker, the entire movie is framed in terms of Mulan’s resistance against the patriarchal society in which she lives. Mulan knows her potential, and in the face of dire consequences, she doesn’t hesitate to trust herself and in the process acquire quite a body count for a kids’ movie. Bonus points for gratuitous scenes of Li Shang questioning his sexuality and Eddie Murphy voicing a tiny animated dragon. 
1. “Moana” (2016)
It was after no little deliberation that the most recent addition to the genre was placed at number one. However, even without having to withstand the test of time, “Moana” takes the cake. First, Moana is the only princess on this list with a remotely realistic body type. Second, she is an audacious woman of color voiced by an equally audacious woman of color (Auli’i Cravalho). Third, she is the only heroine—princess or not—to have no love interest whatsoever! “Moana” is thematically very similar to “Mulan,” and its worldbuilding creates a history and a mythology new and exciting enough to captivate a wide array of audiences. On top of that, the soundtrack is marked by the instantly recognizable style of the inimitable Lin-Manuel Miranda—and yes, there is rapping, though it’s not about the founding fathers. All in all, “Moana” tells the tale of emotionally complex and stirringly realistic characters to serve as role models for movie-goers of any age.

Janelle Monáe’s new music video, “Make Me Feel,” opens with the singer gloriously decked out in ’80s apparel, walking into the kind of club that exists only on TV screens. She looks nervous. The lights are low, and the synth is pulsing in anticipation. The tension is palpable. Then Monáe runs into her water-gun wielding alter ego and the lyrics start—that’s when “Make Me Feel” starts to get interesting.
The rest of the music video is a montage of explicitly Prince-inspired clips, each one brighter and more surreal than the last. There’s a scene where Monáe dances in sheer rose-covered pants among girls doing aerobics. Later, she writhes under a clingy bubblegum-pink sheet. It’s all very sexy, very ’80s, and very Prince. For a video about raw emotion, “Make Me Feel” is surprisingly composed—often Monáe is the only one moving, working around her dancers’ bodies like they’re a set of neon props. The video has an exhibitionary quality to it, with Monáe playing a charming explorer-guide to ’80s sex appeal.
What “Make Me Feel” is not, however, is objectifying or derivative. Monáe takes some risks (the direct allusions to Prince, the sexual physicality) and owns them completely. She is treating bodies as objects, and she is borrowing overtly from previous artists. Instead of coming off as crass, the result is fresh and alluring. At least in part, this appeal stems from the video’s sexual politics. Monáe is a girl who places herself in romantic situations with both girls (or one girl, actress Tessa Thompson) and men. The top YouTube comment for “Make Me Feel” says it all: “BI ANTHEM.”
Monáe is also simply too powerful a presence to come across as subservient or unoriginal. This is not a video about girls, for boys—it is a video by and for girls alone, especially girls who are outside the confines of the white feminine ideal. This is a song about liberation, where “liberation” means empowerment instead of lowered inhibitions. Throughout, Monáe remains masterfully in control of her image. “Make Me Feel” is less explicitly robotic than the artist’s earlier efforts—her debut album was titled “The ArchAndroid”—but it retains a touch of mechanical composure. Her gestures are often subtle, mirroring a video where the chorus fades into an understated, raspy mutter. In short: Monáe runs this song. Especially when coupled with her other recent single, “Django Jane,” it’s a masterclass in black female empowerment.
But the single best thing about “Make Me Feel” is how fun it is. Monáe is no musical lightweight, and her newest video feels like a talented artist out to have a good time. She wears skin-tight silver pants. She slinks around her backup dancers’ thighs. Possibly the video’s strongest scenes are when Monáe, wearing an oversized suit jacket and black tights, dances around an empty stage like anyone else might in the safety of her room. It’s funny. It’s infectious. And if the video rises to prominence in the coming months, this will be why. In “Make Me Feel,” Janelle Monáe has created something feel-good, and watchable, and incredibly fun to watch.

In the imperfectly perfect world of Connecticut royalty, even lawn mowers bleat eerily. Amanda (Olivia Cooke) arrives at her old classmate Lily’s (Anya Taylor-Joy) immaculate mansion for an SAT tutoring session, which sounds innocuous enough. If Amanda’s insouciant slouch and beady gaze don’t hint enough at her interiority, she explains herself outright: “I don’t have any feelings, ever.” Oh, and she is awaiting trial for animal cruelty after brutally slaughtering her prized racehorse. A prim and proper Lily silently acquiesces to a life that her detached mother (Francie Swift) and her hyper-functional, super-controlling stepfather Mark (Paul Sparks) dictate for her. Lily’s conveniently rekindled friendship—if one could call it that—with Amanda becomes a prelude to their criminal partnership in murdering Mark. For the most part, director Cory Finley manages a tantalizing and artistic balance in dwelling on tidy surfaces and revealing the stifled motivations beneath them. Though sometimes he withholds so much for the sake of the film’s air of heady mystery, skimping on depicting Lily’s crucial emotional backstory.
Finley admirably and perceptively enhances the viewer experience by drawing on many cinematic devices of alienation. The cinematographer, Lyle Vincent, works with aptly eerie transitions, using slow and dizzying pans to blackness, accompanied by gurgling noises from Mark’s erg machine upstairs. In one scene, Lily, in search of her mother, walks through a hallway that Vincent casts in a luridly, strikingly blue tint that hints at the underlying uneasiness her perfect updo doesn’t. Lily and Amanda watch several 1940s films in Lily’s cavernous parlor, and the campy musical numbers enacted on the fuzzy gray screen are disquietingly removed from the girls’ sterile, modern reality. Finley also employs a wonderfully strange and cacophonous soundtrack of knocking and strumming percussive noises, of whinnying and whimpering, to contrast with the silence Lily and Amanda wade through in the opulent spaces of Lily’s home.
Finley orients his audience in Amanda’s world and inscrutable mind with effectively interspersed, and not excessive, signposts. The first shot of the film shows Amanda gazing steadfastly into her horse’s eyes, presumably before she kills him. The camera later briefly pans around her bedroom, to horse portraits and competition trophies and ribbons strewn all about her walls. In an SAT pamphlet, the camera adopts Amanda’s laser-focus fixation on the word “horse.” Even if Finley doesn’t explain what horses have to do with anything, he makes it clear she’s obsessed with them, which makes for a satisfyingly mysterious bit at the end that suggests the psychological nature of her affinity. And thanks to Cooke’s perfect deadpan, Amanda’s self-proclamations are simple but effectively bemusing: “I have to work a little harder than everyone else to be good.” She possesses a different sentience in her emotionless state, somehow seeing more clearly with her penetrating gaze: She announces to Lily, after Mark leaves the room, “Wow… you hate him. You despise him.”
But Finley never sufficiently reveals the fury brimming beneath Lily’s surface: She never erupts, even privately, and emphatically enlists Amanda’s help in committing the murder only after her stepfather expresses his wish to send her to a school for girls with serious behavioral issues. She does, however, slowly take on the steely mannerisms of Amanda—eating her peas and staring into the distance, unblinking. Finley doesn’t get to the heart of Lily’s interpersonal problems, or her personality, except for when Mark characterizes her explicitly: “In your brain, all these people are little offshoots of your consciousness. We’re all your maids.” His tidy appraisal of a character whom Finley hardly explicates beyond her conditioned self-denial, conveniently precedes Amanda’s sober observation: “Empathy isn’t your strong suit.” The bitter encounters between Lily and Mark are indeed strung with tension, but do not have the pointed hostility or build-up to make her violent reaction triumphantly vindictive, especially because her emotional past is only hinted at in a passing mention of her recently deceased father.
Amanda’s nonchalant posturing does come to a head: “The only thing worse than being incompetent or being evil is being indecisive.” All this time, she’s been training Lily in the art of decisiveness, and Lily must choose to act. The crime scene is rendered with Finley’s restraint and innovative aesthetic indulgence with plenty of disquieting aural stimulation, and Taylor-Joy’s unnerving acting shines. Finley does the challenging work of sustaining Amanda’s mystique and of forcing his audience to puzzle over how to morally assess Lily. The film’s quietly disturbing aesthetic and fascinating character arcs make for a thoroughly bewildering, addicting watch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To what extent can the beauty of a film compensate for foundational weakness and unanswered questions? Director Alex Garland’s “Annihilation” makes a fair case with its gorgeous visuals and convincing CGI, but even these cannot make up for its lack of story development. We find ourselves questioning the motivations behind key events more often than Garland immerses us within his fantastically frightening world, in which a meteor strike in Florida generates an expanding zone dubbed The Shimmer that genetically mutates all life forms within it. All expeditions sent to reach the heart of the alien territory has disappeared until Kane (Oscar Isaac), the husband of protagonist Lena (Natalie Portman), returns barely alive and very much not himself. Out of love—and perhaps something more—Lena enters The Shimmer.
As “Annihilation” flashes back and forth between scenes from Lena’s marriage, her experience within The Shimmer, and the government interrogation after her escape, we are somehow expected to believe that Lena gains an understanding of the science behind the mutations taking place inside. “It’s not destroying. It’s creating something new,” says Lena in her government interrogation after she escapes from the alien zone. Though Lena seems to understand something fundamental about the mysterious extraterrestrial virus brought to Earth by a meteor strike, Garland never explains fully what exactly she understands. Therefore, we by default struggle to grasp what The Shimmer is as well.
The purpose of this alien world is also never fully explained. This is not the alien invasion in “Independence Day,” in which hostile beings attempt to enslave mankind, nor is it the extraterrestrial contact in “Arrival,” meant to gift humans an advanced language. We can state a number of reasons based on the sci-fi predecessors of “Annihilation,” but these past movies always establish the intentions of the foreigners by the end of the movie. That’s not the case in “Annihilation.” Yes, Garland illustrates in a cinematically beautiful way that the alien force is mixing the DNA of all life forms and refracting naturally occurring waves, but the alien’s motivations behind this are a mystery, due to the fact that Garland never elucidates what it hopes to take from or bring to Earth.
Unfortunately, this issue has side-effects that seep into other significant aspects of the film. “Annihilation” suffers throughout from a lack of consistency in how the extraterrestrial expanse treats the film’s characters. The five women (including Lena) who enter The Shimmer together share a common tendency of self-destruction: Anya (Gina Rodriguez) suffered from addiction and substance abuse, Josie (Tessa Thompson) had previously inflicted self-harm, and Lena had sabotaged her happy marriage by cheating, the reason her husband entered The Shimmer in the first place. Garland seems to establish The Shimmer as a vehicle for truth that affects the women in ways befitting their mental states. If The Shimmer really were to have this purpose within the film’s universe, it would certainly make sense and would impart some kind of purpose to the alien. However, a lack of consistency undermines the narrative and substantive purpose of The Shimmer, as each woman meets a principally different end: The Shimmer subjects some to pitifully normal deaths but grants others increased agency. We are left wondering what The Shimmer’s laws are in treating those who enter it, which then leads to confusion as to what the characters represent within the film space. Some may be inherently more valuable than others, or perhaps there are certain qualities that this extraterrestrial deems worthier. Maybe The Shimmer knows imperceptible things about humans and all others, but this interpretation might be giving the aliens credit they don’t deserve.
Finally, Garland’s concluding scene tries to emulate the ending of “Arrival,” but has neither its nuance nor revelation. With ambiguous endings, it’s unclear whether the film has reached its limit for unclarified facts. Other aspects of “Annihilation” must be explicit enough for us to handle a conclusion that leaves us pondering, or the film runs the risk that one more drop of vagueness will tip us into frustration. “Annihilation” raises so many questions that it would benefit from the closure of a concrete ending. However, we are left not with fodder for thought but rather with doubts about the plot.

Originally formed in 1967 in London, the original lineup of Fleetwood Mac only included two of its present members, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood. Though the first incarnation garnered success in Europe, it was only after the addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham in 1974, followed by their self-titled album in 1975, that the band rose to mainstream popularity.
The album “Fleetwood Mac,” known among fans as “The White Album,” includes two of Stevie Nicks’ songs that eventually came to represent the band’s era, one characterized by uncertainty and change as the band relocated from England to California and began to amass commercial success. In “Landslide,” written while Nicks admired the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, stripped-back acoustic guitar backs Nicks’ plaintive questioning: “What is love? / Can the child within my heart rise above? Can I sail through the changing ocean tides? / Can I handle the seasons of my life?” The song is contemplative, but in signature Stevie Nicks style, it equivocates—this time, between clinging to the past (“Well, I’ve been afraid of changing”) and trying to embrace change (“I’m getting older, too”).
“Rhiannon,” the second popular track from the album, is “about an old Welsh witch,” as Nicks famously prefaces the song in its music video. Based loosely on the story of a Welsh goddess, “Rhiannon” channels Nicks’ well-known obsession with the occult—but more generally, the song is about a woman who can’t be controlled, a “woman taken by the wind.” As guitars ascend on a minor scale, then descend again, there’s a constant, sonic swell and deflation, a rising and falling energy. In live versions of the song, Nicks delivered high-powered, knockout vocal performances, almost too passionate for comfort. “Her Rhiannon in those days was like an exorcism,” Mick Fleetwood said in a VH1 documentary.
As band members continued to flirt, fight, and fall in love, tensions within the group rose more than ever. By 1977, two couples—John and Christine McVie, as well as Buckingham and Nicks—had separated, and even Fleetwood was in the process of divorcing his wife. Coupled with this turmoil, there was a particular pressure to produce a stellar follow-up to the “White Album,” which drove members of the band to abuse drugs and alcohol.
But out of all this anxiety came the band’s most famous album to date: “Rumours,” released in 1977, stayed at the top of the Billboard Hot 200 for 31 weeks and went on to win a Grammy for Album of the Year in 1978. Its stand-out tracks provided a voyeuristic view of the interpersonal drama unfolding backstage. From Buckingham and Nicks’ earlier career as a duo, “I Don’t Wanna Know” proves that ignorance is bliss, a sarcastic end to a torrid affair: “I don’t wanna stand ‘tween you and love, honey, / I just want you to feel fine.” The love affair between Buckingham and Nicks served as the source material for the iconic songs on “Rumours.” “Go Your Own Way” was Lindsey Buckingham’s angsty, drum-heavy account of his quickly devolving relationship with Nicks, who wrote “Dreams,” her own, ethereal version of events in ten minutes with only a few chords. The tracks diverge tonally, but chart the same frustration. “If I could / Baby, I’d give you my world, / How can I / When you won’t take it from me?” Buckingham complains, while Nicks offers self-reflection and redemption, singing, “When the rain washes you clean, you’ll know.” Redemption was a recurring theme for Nicks, who struggled with addiction, first to cocaine, and then to Klonopin.  In “Gold Dust Woman,” penned and sung by Nicks, she warns herself of the tragic downfall that befalls a “pale shadow of a woman”: “Take your silver spoon, dig your grave.”
There’s not much optimism to be found on “Rumours,” with the exception of Christine McVie’s “Don’t Stop,” the most cheerful breakup song in music history. “Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow, / Don't stop, it’ll soon be here,” Buckingham and McVie sing in the chorus. “It’ll be here better than before / Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone.” Its message was so compelling that President Bill Clinton used it as the theme of his 1992 presidential campaign, even convincing the then-disbanded members to reunite for a performance.
The discography of Fleetwood Mac, a prolific band, long extends beyond “Rumours.” It includes “Tusk,” “Mirage,” and “Tango in the Night,” which feature quintessential hits like “Gypsy,” “Little Lies,” and “Everywhere.” Band members pursued solo projects outside of Fleetwood Mac, too—namely, Nicks’ “Edge of Seventeen” on her album, “Bella Donna.” Yet something about the 1977 album resonates above the rest. Despite its release dating back 40-ish years, “Rumours” manages to sound new with every listen, its lyricism idiosyncratic enough to eschew cliché, yet general and humanly true enough to be universal. It’s a voyeuristic look at the heart of Fleetwood Mac, the story of their numerous entanglements: a fortuitous and complicated meeting of musical styles and love stories. It’s the music, which is simple and somehow always fresh, but it’s also their glamorous ’70s California style, their history of break-ups and make-ups, the melodrama and the forces that kept them together. As they sing in “The Chain”—symbolically, the only song that credits all five members—“I can still hear you saying, / You would never break the chain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The premise of Amy Bloom’s newest novel, “White Houses,” is inherently risqué: First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt has a lesbian love affair with reporter Lorena Hickok. It’s an intriguing concept, if primarily for a magazine tabloid. The book promises gossip, drama, and maudlin affairs. The result, however, is far humbler—despite all appearances, this isn’t a book about Eleanor Roosevelt. Instead, Hick (the narrator and Roosevelt’s love interest) consistently steals the show. Bloom falls in love with her protagonist as much as her protagonist has fallen for the First Lady. At its core, “White Houses” is about a lost woman finding herself—and the story is strongest when Bloom lets it remain exactly that.
Especially in the novel’s early chapters, Bloom sticks tightly to her narrator. There is little plot to distract from the character development: It’s a close reading of a human being. This rhetorical decision is both poignant and bleak. There are endless gray years in her childhood home in South Dakota. There’s a lot of Depression-era grit. Overall, the backstory is the novel’s shakiest section. It’s a little too lengthy and occasionally mawkish.
But eventually, Bloom’s lyrical writing style comes into its own. In South Dakota, Hick interacts solely with backstory-supplying villains. In Washington, Bloom introduces supporting characters who are interesting in their own rights. There is a gay Roosevelt cousin who adds a layer of political awareness and a secretary-mistress who complicates Franklin D. Roosevelt’s charismatic exterior. Hick herself benefits the most from the setting change, however, thumping gracelessly around the White House with an amusing lack of shame. She loves and grieves and walks her dog. She meditates on being physically unattractive (“I wasn’t cute. I knew goddamn well I wasn’t cute.”), and on aging (“I can read for an hour or so at a time but I miss reading books by the boatload.”) Author and narrator alike do best in the Capitol—Bloom feeds off the city’s political energy.
Notably, Eleanor Roosevelt is the one character who fails to brighten. In a book ostensibly starring the First Lady, she remains nebulous—Bloom relies on a few overt adjectives (from the inside cover: “idealistic, patrician”) to characterize an entire protagonist. Admittedly, Roosevelt presents a historical challenge for her author. The First Lady is famous, and therefore anything Bloom writes comes into implicit comparison with pre-existing beliefs. Lorena Hickok is a real person too, but the average layman is less likely to be well-versed in her story. Hick can flourish, then, because there are fewer preconceptions about her personality. Bloom thrives when unearthing the neuroses of a more fictional heroine: She is strongest with characters who’ve had less previous analysis.
Bloom’s propensity for detailed character development makes for a great fantasy—and a compelling narrative. What it’s not, however, is fully historical, despite it’s genre. “White Houses” sometimes feels like a story that has not quite found its niche. Bloom isn’t especially interested in Eleanor: She doesn’t analyze 1940s politics of sexuality too deeply, and she is more interested in FDR as a womanizer than as a president. Bloom loves her characters, and she often does right by them. But “White Houses” is at its best when it loses its political veneer and descends into a cherry-blossom fantasy.
Only in the book’s conclusion does the depth of Bloom’s character development become fully apparent. Bloom spends 200 pages unpacking the life of Lorena Hickok, and in the last 10 that life comes into focus. Eleanor Roosevelt, the professed heroine, is dead—and Hick’s grief is poignantly drawn. It is intensely regretful (did Hick compromise too much while Eleanor was alive?) and touching (could things have ended any other way?). The story ends how it should have begun: With the meditations of its narrator on the strange, passionate life she leads. “White Houses” is Hick’s book through and through—sometimes achingly beautiful, sometimes too exhaustive. If Bloom errs, however, it is primarily because she is pretending that her story could have been anything else.

“Siembamba, mama’s little child / Siembamba, mama’s little child / Twist his neck, throw him in the ditch / Step on his head, then he is dead.” So goes the sickening tune which grounds the plot for South African director Darrell Roodt’s latest offering, an indie horror flick called “Lullaby.” The nursery rhyme harkens back to the Anglo-Boer war in South Africa, during which a group of Boer women raped by British soldiers murdered their illegitimate children to decry their own oppression. It’s this very lullaby that haunts the film’s protagonist, Chloe (Reine Swart), as she navigates frightening visions of both a cloaked figure and her own attempt at self-mutilation and infanticide. As Chloe continues to experience these visions, she seeks help from her mother, a childhood friend, and a renowned psychiatrist before finally discovering their true intentions and the role her visions play in a century-old narrative.
The opening scene of the film, one of its most well-executed and harrowing, takes us back to the era of the Anglo-Boer war. In the middle of a remote steppe, a mysteriously hooded female figure and a religious leader of sorts disrupt a Boer women’s camp. The scene culminates in a mother’s scream piercing through dead silence while the hooded figure ruthlessly twists her infant’s head. While such content is obviously disturbing in and of itself, Roodt elevates the eeriness of the scene through the shrewd juxtaposition of mid-shots leading up to the murder: Roodt rapidly cuts between the mother, whose face is anguished, bare and open, and the cloaked figure, whose pale crescent of a face and unsettling hint of a smile are all we see of her. Composer Alun Richards masterfully crafts the scene’s soundscape with accelerating, hollow percussives and sharp, atonal cackling straight out of Robert Eggers’ 2015 masterpiece, “The Witch.” Garish sepia overtones and a somewhat cartoonish visual filter can almost be forgiven. “Lullaby” more or less lands its first scene, leaving its viewer in bated apprehension of what’s to come next.
Unfortunately, as soon as we’re taken to modern-day South Africa, any sort of terror or visceral pull dissipates into tired predictability. “Lullaby” quickly proves itself a soporific, meandering mess of a narrative, full of unlikeable characters and dependent on every horror trope in the book. The film’s jump to the modern era introduces Chloe, whose recurrent visions can’t help but warrant some serious eye-rolling: to name a few, static from a phone and television set, the shadow of a face emerging from the television, the twinkling melody from a wind-up music box, and deranged-looking dolls that cry tears of blood. While the introduction of Chloe’s psychiatrist Dr. Reed (Brandon Auret) helps to move things along, Roodt’s handling of Reed’s character is heavy-handed and worn. In particular, we learn of Reed’s obsessive tendencies through one too many extreme close-ups of his fidgeting fingers—a detail that would have proved endlessly more effective had Roodt trusted his viewers to take notice in a regular mid-shot.
The film ambles along with no clear impetus, falling into the same uninspiring pattern: A wide-eyed Chloe notices an aberration, screams loudly, realizes that it was a vision, and then pays a visit to her questionable psychiatrist to no avail. The roteness is enough to put one to sleep.
Then, the last 30 minutes of the film kick in, and for a bit, “Lullaby” manages to rouse its viewer from their state of half-sleep. Indeed, almost all of the film’s action and substance is jam-packed in its conclusion: Characters finally start to seem more human, and blatant holes in the narrative suddenly start to fill in. Chloe trades her obstinance and terror for fiery, physical anger. Chloe’s mother finally shows a stroke of vulnerability. The father of the newborn is revealed, as are the true natures of both Dr. Reed and Chloe’s childhood friend. All the pieces of Chloe’s story come together rapidly and seamlessly, like something out of a dream. But by the time all of this occurs, we’ve learned not to care. Roodt’s threadbare “Lullaby” fails to evoke the kind of emotional investment that its ending and structure so demand. Regrettably, despite the film’s resounding conclusion, viewers will wonder why they stuck through to the ending at all.

My mother learned English from her grandfather. He gave her a very tattered Oxford English Dictionary, a relic of his time spent studying biology in Britain, and designed an ambitious plan of study: every morning, she had to copy a page of definitions letter by letter, and every evening, he would check her transcriptions by reading them aloud. The day he killed himself, she didn’t finish her writing practice, and she dreaded his return from work until she found out it was never coming. A few weeks later, his dictionary was confiscated and burned by Red Guards.
She would repeat this story to us every time we were disobedient. You’re going to kill me, she’d say. Just do the dishes. Come out of your room. Finish your food. Finish your food. Finish your food.
Now she is telling this story again, but for a different reason. “Can’t you see what a good project this is?” Her voice crackles in my earbuds. “A young girl teaching herself English. A small act of insurgency against insurgency. It’s just like what I tried to do as a girl. And imagine how it’ll look on her résumé!”
“But think of how much school she’ll miss.”
My mother scoffs. “One good role can launch a career.”
“I just don’t think it’s right,” I say, and I hang up so abruptly that she’ll believe me later, when I tell her it was inclement weather that interrupted our connection.
****
Once I get back, the first thing Audrey and I do is walk to the grocery store. Though it’s hardly the most exciting activity to kick off the winter breaks of our respective freshman years, we’ll take any opportunity to get out of the house.
I’m craving macaroni today, and Audrey suggests that we make some together. “I need your help,” she tells me, holding up two boxes of pasta. “Which is healthier?”
“Whole wheat, I guess.”
She moves down the aisle, scrutinizing the rows of tomato sauce. “This one has more sodium but not as many calories.” She analyzes the nutrition labels with such intense concentration that she nearly collides with a shopper in a Barry’s Bootcamp t-shirt. I tell myself I shouldn’t be surprised. There is something about this age that seems to infect everyone with these preoccupations, albeit to varying degrees.
But I want to tell her what it felt like.
“Since when do you care about this stuff, Audrey?” I want to tell her about the hunger beyond hunger, when it is no longer the stomach begging but the entire body. I want to tell her about the wanting, and the punishment for wanting, and the endlessness of each day.
“I have to. For the part.” She lowers her voice. “For the movie.”
“Oh. Right.”
Audrey places a can of fat-free low-sodium tomato sauce in our shopping cart.
“Are you sure you want to do it? If you don’t eat enough you’ll be short for the rest of your life.” It’s too hard to tell her about the other reasons, the other consequences.
“I’m not gonna do anything crazy. Just eat better and run longer distances, that’s all.” She takes a jar of peanut butter from its shelf, then puts it back down. I think of the night before my fourteenth birthday: me and my dorm-mate in the common room swishing peanut butter in our mouths and spitting the brown globs into a plastic bag. We can’t tell anyone about this, I’d said. People are gonna think we’re pre-bulimic or some shit.
“Can you at least think about taking a different role instead?” I ask.
“I’ve already thought about it. I don’t want a minor part. I don’t want to be an extra.” She walks to the next aisle and I watch her sprinter’s legs flex in ways mine can’t. I imagine her leggings growing loose; I imagine her rifling through the sick clothes I should have donated; I imagine her trying on the jeans I wore when the infirmary nurses asked me why my heart rate was so low.
“Whatever then. If you’re so sure.”
I know that there is no way to stop this, that my mother would laugh if I told her my fears, laugh and do worse than laugh. No pain my sister and I have faced or will face could ever compare to hers. Losing twenty-five pounds to play a starving communist child is one thing; growing up a starving communist child is another.
—Staff writer Angela F. Hui's column, "My Sister Will Be Hungry," is a serialized work of fiction centered around a college student's relationships with her mother and sister. The story explores the effects of collective cultural trauma on the second generation of an American family.

“How’s it going?” Kwan Yin’s cheery voice came through the phone.
“Hey. I did some work on my screenplay. I was wondering if I could show it to you sometime,” I said.
“What about now? I’m eating sushi by myself.”
We met up at a café in the early afternoon.
“I like the script,” she said. “It’s very personal.” She skimmed through it again. “Maybe this could be an animation?”
I thought for a moment. “I didn’t think of that, but maybe it makes sense. The end might work well as an animation.”
“How is it going to end?”
“She looks outside the window, and imagines that if she jumps, she will be able to fly across the city. Then she realizes it is only an illusion and rejects the temptation to commit suicide. At that moment her bedroom door reappears and opens, and all the people she loves are outside clapping for her.”
“That’s a nice ending,” Kwan Yin said. “I think it’s the middle part that’s going to be hard. It can get too self-pitying and become a ‘look at me, I’m so sad’ story. It’s good to start with sentimentality, but then you need to transcend it, not indulge in it, if that makes sense.”
“For sure,” I said. I repeated her words in my mind.
“But it’s good. I’m always jealous of you young people who devote their lives to a single vision. I’m just drifting around. I’m interested in a lot of things, but I don’t have a passion.”
“What are some things you are interested in?” I said. I wanted to change the topic and stop talking about myself.
“Well, I did venture capitalism for quite a while. I’m very into charity work. I also thought for a moment that I could be a good museum curator.” She made quotation marks with her hands. “In your ‘art world.’”
“You said you’re jealous of people like me, but I am constantly jealous of people like you,” I said half-jokingly. “Entrepreneurs, NGO staff, or even dishonest politicians. These are people who live their lives to achieve some kind of goal. They use their time and energy to make an impact on the world. Me, I’m still struggling with the mere act of living.”
“They probably know less about life than you do,” she immediately dismissed me. “They just don’t think about it.”
We took a walk to a rock beach. There was a natural jetty jutting out into the ocean, breaking the waves into clouds of white spray. As we walked down it, I held her hand, but when we sat down at the end, she pulled hers away from mine. It was a windy day, and there was fog over the Pacific. We talked for a while, but then reached an unspoken understanding that we both preferred silence. I laid down and looked at her profile. She put some hair into her mouth.
“Go to this barbecue party with me tonight,” she said after a while, as if she were thinking out loud. “I’m not close with any of the people.”
“Sure,” I said.
When we left the beach I opened my mouth to say something, but then decided I should not. She noticed and asked me what it was.
“You were manipulating me,” I said. “You told me to come to the barbecue with you because you don’t know the people, but you seem to be very comfortable with strangers. You only said that so that I would think you needed me, and I would grow more attached,” I said finally.
“You doubt yourself too much,” she said calmly but resolutely. “Everybody has these doubts, but you give them too much credence. I have fear and confusion in my life too.”
The bus arrived just as she finished the sentence. She never said anything more.

In the foreword to her recent collection of essays, “Feel Free,” Zadie Smith—perhaps the most celebrated novelist of her generation, responsible for such classics as “White Teeth” and “NW”—places the art of writing “at the intersection of three precarious, uncertain elements: language, the world, the self.” “The first is never wholly mine,” Smith writes. “The second I can only ever know in a partial sense. The third is a malleable and improvised response to the previous two.” In conversation with “Radio Boston” host Meghna Chakrabarti at Coolidge Corner Theatre, Smith investigated these three elements speaking, on everything from the topical to the abstract.
Indeed, Smith’s virtuosity with language, both on the page and off, may have been the main draw for the audience members of this sold-out event. This seems obvious—wielding words well is part of Smith’s profession—yet there is something about Smith’s voice that fans feel obligated to remark upon. “I just love her style of writing. It’s just beautiful. Even if it’s a novel...or these essays, it doesn’t matter what she writes, I just love the way she writes,” Boston resident, Alice E. Gray said.
“[Her voice] is extremely unique, and it’s consistent,” Tasha A. Sandoval, another Boston resident said. “Without fail, [it] comes through so powerfully and strongly.”
At the talk, Smith said she was shocked that certain sentences and even words could have a stranglehold on American policy, pointing to the logic of “Guns don’t kill people, people do” as a particularly egregious example. She went on to deconstruct the phrase “exploiting a tragedy” and the way opponents of gun control treat this phenomenon as “a horrible curse” in order to obstruct productivity in the wake of a shooting.
“I loved what she said about the word ‘exploitation,’ because...I am an alumna of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland,” Sandoval said. “I’m involved in some of the local activism around that. [Smith’s comment] gives me a really nice framework around which to think about the way ‘exploitation’ is happening around this issue in a positive rather than a negative way.”
Speaking of the world at large, Smith maintained this level of clear-eyed, righteous passion. Chakrabarti quoted Smith’s recent Guardian interview: “I… can’t stand dogma, lazy ideas, catchphrases, group-think, illogic, pathos disguised as logos, shoutiness, ad hominem attacks, bombast, liberal piety, conservative pomposity, ideologues, essentialists, technocrats, preachers, fanatics, cheerleaders or bullies.” At the theater, Smith added, “It’s quite a hard time to be alive if you feel that way.” Despite this in-depth discussion of world issues, she professed little interest in remaining in the loop beyond the bare minimum. “I just listen to the radio when I’m cleaning, so I get the main part… I get enough, let’s put it that way,” Smith said when asked about keeping up with the news. She said that she instead focused on what she found personally fulfilling, setting in opposition “The Kingdom” by Emmanuel Carrère (her preferred read) and five different newspapers (her husband’s). “To me, reading this 1000-page book about Christ was incredibly important to me, personally, “ Smith said. “And [Paul] Manafort and [Rick] Gates can wait. Or be summed up by my husband over dinner.”
Indeed, over the course of the event, Smith emerged as a champion of the self, keeping political demands at a distance. While she agreed that boundaries and allegiances are important, especially in these fraught times, she also reminded us that “there is another part of you that is intimate, that can’t stand on a podium.” It is this self, the self “whose boundaries are uncertain, whose language is never pure, whose world is in no way ‘self-evident,’” that Smith takes as her cause. “People are deeply various in themselves,” she said.
Smith made her thoughts most explicit when addressing the question of authenticity, which she believes is fundamentally misguided: “If you set the bar of a certain authentic experience, someone is always going to fall short of it… To me, I don’t want to block myself off from anything.” When asked about novelists who write about experiences they do not (and cannot) know, Smith argued that their success lies in the aesthetic as much as in the ethical. As long as their depiction is “convincing,” the novelists have free rein, made freer by Smith’s refusal of essentializing logic. “‘Anna Karenina,’ to my view, is convincing,” she said. “The problem with all these arguments is the idea that there is an essential female experience. What does it look like?... What does it mean to feel like a woman? I don’t know now! I’m 42, and I am in this gender, and I couldn’t tell you specifically what feeling like a woman is.” She rejected authenticity as restrictive, confining people to certain set behaviors because of their backgrounds, sapping them of their individuality, their ability to surprise, their freedom: “Say I’m reading a book about a mixed-race girl from London, and suddenly it doesn’t seem to me what I would feel. Okay! That’s okay. It’s not my experience, [but] I could never say that, ‘A mixed-race girl from London would never say that.’ I just can’t believe in a universe where it’s not possible that one of them might say that out loud. I can’t have that complete thought.”
Yet identity remains key to Smith, and its foregrounding—both literary and embodied—resonates deeply with her readers. “She’s a black woman, and so I feel a oneness with her,” Gray said. “The fact that on the stage, there are going to be two women of color, is really significant to me. Because I’m going to be 71 on Friday, and when I was a kid, when there was a black person on TV, everybody was in front of the TV, because you didn’t see yourself. But this is perfect, this is wonderful.”

As the weather turned from heavy rain to light flurries of snowflakes on  March 2, the Jose Mateo Ballet Theatre dancers bourrée-d through a program that started with heavy “Affairs” before progressing into lighthearted “Released.” These two dances, along with “Time Beyond Time,” formed the triad of “Stolen Hearts,” the company’s spring program. A display of solid technique and evocative choreography, interwoven with beautiful and probing music, created an intimate and jaunting night at the Sanctuary Theatre on Harvard Street.
With no clear distinction between the dance floor and the audience seating, the theatre is an open and vulnerable space for dancers, drawing attention to imperfections but also highlighting breathtaking feats. The miniature slips and jump landings sounded louder than in a traditional theatre, yet the dancers’ bodies and athleticism, as well as their facial expressions, are clearly accentuated in the space.
The first number, “Affairs,” opened with Magdalena Gyftopoulos in a simple grey chiffon slip dress, shimmering under the light as she passéd nimbly on her toes and stepped across the stage with a lost look on her face. The music, “Affairs of the Heart (Concerto for Violin and Strings),” composed by Marjan Mozetich, flowed like water in the beginning with the a rhythmic chord in the background, accompanied by blue lighting and a backdrop reminiscent of waves. Spencer Doru Keith shined as the heartthrob of the “Affairs,” exuding charm in his technique, entangled with multiple lovers. Through different pairings of dancers accompanied by a small ensemble of corps dancers, clad in beautiful colors, an abstract story of infidelity and betrayal unfolded. The choreography in the pas de deux sections sparks a chemistry between the partners, along with tension and doubt.
“Time Beyond Time” proved to be the most moving piece of the evening. Oliver Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time” rung eerily, but Mateo’s choreography suggested a more “Alice in Wonderland” narrative than a haunting story. The dancers struck poses synchronized with the piano’s jaunting sounded, seemingly setting up the ballet to be sharp and precise. In the second movement, however, Madeleine Bonn performed in a dream-like trance with slow partnering and strong lifts by Stephen James, suspended for impressively long seconds. As the corps fell into sleeping positions and awakened disjointedly, Bonn embraced individual dancers. The ending felt abrupt and confused, reflective of the tone of the piece, as James carried Bonn to a sleeping position with the closing chords.
Despite the emotional dancing timed to the enrapturing music, the wardrobe of “Time Beyond Time” missed the mark. The lavender leotards on the female dancers were splotched with a gradient v-neck in delicate hues, but the resulting effect looked more like sweat stains than watercolor.
Vibrant blue leotard-dresses complemented the performance much more in the last piece, “Released.” Set to Ferruccio Busoni and Johann Sebastian Bach’s “Concerto for Keyboard & Strings in D Minor,” the closing piece was the most standard Neoclassical ballet amongst the three. It started out with traditional steps, and the dancers posed both gracefully and authoritatively. The energetic beginning turned into a more relaxed second movement, as the hands became more interpretive in partnered promenades and penchés. Angie DeWolf and Haruka Tamura cleanly executed the steps, and true to the title of the piece, released the rigid form and port de bras to give way to non-traditional positions. The ending was a bit disappointing and lacking in character, except for a few out-of-place Russian mazurka steps, as the authoritative tone returned and any signs of release disappeared again. “Stolen Hearts,” the second to last show for the company under its founding director Jose Mateo, churned dark feelings but ultimately fell short of stealing hearts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past month, student group Harvard College Faith in Action endured two serious public relations debacles, both regarding the group’s relation to the BGLTQ community. The first incident arose when HCFA invited renowned ex-lesbian Jackie Hill-Perry, who became famous for claiming that her rebirth into faith saved her from a “lifestyle of homosexual sin,” to speak at its weekly Doxa meeting. Then, in the wake of a public outcry and several opinion pieces, news broke that HCFA had dismissed one of its Bible study group leaders after she  dated someone of the same gender—though group leaders cited reasons of “theological disagreement.” After the latter incident, the College put the group on "probation," reportedly  marking the first instance of such disciplinary action in the history of the College.
Much of the response among community members and the wider public has echoed a familiar array of sentiments. One student interviewed by The Crimson chastised the non-denominational Christian group for exemplifying “institutional backlash against queer people.” An op-ed judged HCFA “complicit in promoting dangerous homophobic rhetoric” and threatening “the emotional and physical safety of LGBT people here on campus.” One commenter following the story on a BGLTQ  news site staked out a more extreme position: “Virginal births, talking snakes, boats with two of every species on board… Enough judging people through the prism of fairy tales.”
It seems to this author that these reactions, some more respectfully than others, leave unexamined the purchase that faith still holds in people’s lives—and the lives of BGLTQ people no less. To identify “dangerous homophobic rhetoric” as the object of our frustration means leaving the underlying problem—the way faith is often framed as contending with our secular sensibilities—unaddressed. Attributing homophobia to a belief in “virginal births [and] talking snakes” only exacerbates that problem, affirming categories like “religious-and-straight” and “secular-and-queer” that constrain nonconforming expressions of identity.
Certain student commentators seem to have picked up on this friction. Abraham E. Rebollo ’20 worried that putting HCFA on probation might “feed into the modern Christian persecution complex.” Nicholas P. Whittaker ’19 reminded that a “more thorough…thoughtful drag [of HCFA] would seek to understand the complexities of the Black Faithful experience.” Sarah K. Grammar ’18 put it plainly: “side note: faith is important to a good number of queer people.”
Understanding the Hill-Perry incident and the later “theological disagreement” thus requires highlighting the way faith bisects the BGLTQ community. This means, among other things, taking seriously the claim, formulated by one self-identified gay, Christian student, that “I am two.” Accommodating this sentiment means rethinking the way we often banish religion from everyday discussion or consign it to the purgatory of “outdated” ideas. We must work instead to cultivate a space in which gods, spirits, the secular, and the queer can cohabitate.
This can seem a daunting undertaking, particularly in an age when it has become the unhappy business of secularism to provincialize the divine. For good or ill, the old American insight that it is impolite to discuss faith in public prevails in many areas of the country. Yet learning to speak about religion—and irreligion—as more profound than simple superstition, cynicism, or ideology is a timely lesson, and at Harvard, a strong first step toward community healing.
Concerns about resurrecting religious discussion should not be dismissed. As one cultural commentator recently reminded, “People actually begin wars and kill one another over conflicting religious views.” Nor are these wars foreign to our experience. Of America’s contentious political disputes, several are rooted in competing modes of belief: opposition to abortion for instance is highly variegated along lines of sect, concentrated among evangelical Christians. This conflict has produced its fair share of bloodshed since the 1980s. Whether it is value differences themselves, or our inability to adjudicate them diplomatically that results in body counts, is as yet undetermined.
It is also not obvious whether the posited categories “religious-and-straight” and “secular-and-queer” are anything more than persistent imaginings. That we have accepted religiosity as a stand-in for sexual preference only confirms that we see religion as bound up with our pasts and secularism as consubstantial with sexual liberation. This view ignores what Divinity School professor Diana L. Eck calls the “deep meaning” of religion in the present day, whose significance often extends to BGLTQ people. It also airbrushes the way secular forces have often been mobilized against the BGLTQ rights dialogue.
Importantly, the contrary position—that religion is a source of suffering for many members of the BGLTQ community—is not dissolved by adopting a more expansive view of the sexual/religious intersection. We actually revive the potential for religious criticism by acknowledging that queerness does always materialize within secularism. It is precisely our ability to talk about the benefits of BGLTQ faith that also enables us to resume a critical dialogue on religious shortcomings.
In the present moment, foregrounding these discussions becomes essential. With regard to HCFA, we ought to read the College’s sanctions less as a blanket measure against “hate” and more as a call to thoroughly articulate our values. In the rush to mobilize standard activist vocabulary—terms like “hate” and “tolerance,” “bigotry” and “discrimination”—against Hill-Perry and HCFA, we might double-check to ensure we haven’t misnamed the problem or alienated the BGLTQ faithful from their own dialogue.
This is the first step toward our communal repentance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The life of man,” declared Thomas Hobbes, was once “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short,” with “continual fear and danger of violent death,” and so it remains with the life of students who live in the River Houses.
Freshmen, I know you must be excited, eagerly awaiting your House assignments. But I know: You’re afraid to be Quadded. You envision your Housing Day living in mortal fear: knees weak, palms sweaty, as you imagine the Pforzheimer polar bear, the Cabot codfish or the Currier tree a-knocking at your door, sealing your fate for the next three years. Oh, the horror!
As a Quadling who was in the same boat last year, I can assure you your fears are overblown. Allow me to justify the ways of Quad to freshmen—for the River is much worse.
For starters: the Quad is architecturally pleasing and has incredibly spacious housing. Compare this, if you will, to the River, where you could be placed inside that giant concrete cinder block masquerading as Mather House, or (God forbid!) be sentenced to purgatory in that labyrinth of walkthrough doubles that somehow became Kirkland House.
“But wait!” I hear you cry. “The Quad is so far away!” I appreciate the distance to the dangerous River, where one can get assaulted, stabbed and mugged, or invaded by sketchy suspects (sorry, Leverett House). Contrariwise, the Quad remains pristine, devoid of tourists, criminals, and other reminders of a strife-plagued world. This is what makes it a home: the issues of the weary wider world simply do not haunt us here in our hinterland. Besides, the 13-minute jaunt is a great source of exercise for those, like me, averse to any other form of physical activity. For the more athletically inclined, the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center is like the Malkin Athletic Center (and now with Lowell’s climbing wall!).
Yes, I admit there are drawbacks. Porter Square is closer than Harvard Square, and I always feel a twinge of regret when, coming outbound on the T from Boston, I skip Harvard and get off at Porter. But the Porter Square station is a lot nicer. And yes, there is civilization outside Harvard Square! Walking up Massachusetts Ave. (or penny-boarding, as a good friend of mine does) is a great pleasure. The shops and buildings, unique amenities, and vastly superior Chinese fare all add to Cambridge’s unique atmosphere. Ours is a city that is more than overpriced hamburger shops, empty clothing stores, and illegally-operating markets.
Plus, Porter Square has a Target coming soon, to add to the 24-hour CVS, bookstore, great Thai food restaurant, and more already there. What does the Square have? The Dickson Bros. Hardware Store and a Warby Parker. A Warby Parker! I know Harvard students love to act the hipster, but honestly—we’ve gone too far!
As I have stated before, I can’t overstate how much better the living is in Quad Houses—it’s a great advantage. Pforzheimer House was apparently at full capacity this year, and still I am told only eight of my fellow sopfhomores were unlucky enough to have hallway doubles during the fall. My linkmates in Currier House live in a suite with a fully-furnished kitchen and an excessively large common room—and they were by no means first in their House lottery. With the exception of monstrous Mather, why would one want the possibility of getting housing as bad or worse than that of your freshman dorm? Do you relish getting "sexiled" by your two roommates in your walkthrough triple?
Additionally, River Houses can also consume one whole. Take Adams House. Living in that Gothic mansion of decayed wealth is like waiting for the fall of the House of Usher—it’s only a matter of time until it caves in on itself. They desperately need their upcoming renovation!
Finally, the Quad’s party spaces are incredibly lively. As someone who lives three stories above the world-famous Pfoho Igloo, my inability to sleep on Friday and Saturday nights is a testament to how “lit” the Quad is. Compare this once again to Adams, which notoriously instituted a ban on alcohol in their social spaces. I personally don’t even drink alcohol, and I’m offended by that policy. You will find diversity and inclusion in the Quad, my friends—no unceremonious banishing and bashing from us!
If you do get sorted into a River House, I do offer my condolences. Such are the odds, after all—like our poor brethren at that safety school in New Haven, we can’t all win at life. March is the cruelest month, as T.S. Eliot, Class of 1909, might have said (a reference to the House of the same name, I’m sure.)
Okay, I’ll be honest. Despite my facetiousness, you will be happy in whatever House you get sorted into. Housing Day is one of celebration, not despair. It’s a day in which the entire Harvard community comes together and celebrates a unique tradition found nowhere else. Whether polar bears or penguins storm your dorm this Thursday, enjoy the suspense, the excitement, the thrill, the amazing feeling that comes with being part of a new community that will accept you. It’s not just a House you’re joining, but a home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that 10 women are now accusing Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez of sexual misconduct. In 1983, Harvard had relieved Dominguez of administrative duties for sexually harassing a junior colleague. In response to these new allegations, which now total 18 and span decades, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Dominguez on immediate administrative leave. In an email to Harvard affiliates, University Provost Alan M. Garber encouraged members of the Harvard community to come forward with stories of “inappropriate behavior,” with the promise that these allegations would be taken seriously.
We are disappointed but not surprised that the University did not respond more definitively to Dominguez’s severe misconduct in the early '80s. Yet we are taken aback that, in spite of being disciplined for sexual harassment, Dominguez continued to rise through Harvard’s ranks for over 30  years. By letting Dominguez remain in contact with students, and allowing him to remain in his position of power, the University put its students and wider community at risk, turning a blind eye to his history of gender-based harassment. Out of respect to the accusers, and out of a clear need to demonstrate its commitment to a safe, assault-free community, the University must publicly and openly acknowledge its past failures.
But that step—while critical—is only symbolic. The University cannot turn back time and prevent past students from being victimized. Going forward, it must take definitive and practical steps to prevent future students from going through what Terry Karl reported enduring. Harvard must do more to actively protect its community members from abuses of power that allow sexual misconduct.
Although Dominguez was previously disciplined for sexual harassment in the 1980s, we acknowledge that the most recent allegations against him have not yet been verified. We thus believe that Harvard has taken an appropriate step by placing Dominguez on administrative leave while it looks into these claims. Yet the University should not use his status on leave as an opportunity to dawdle in its pursuit of truth and justice. An investigation must begin immediately and progress swiftly, and we urge the University to be expeditious in its fact-checking of these accusations.
And if Harvard finds that these systemic, deplorable accounts are substantiated, we see only one valid response: Immediate dismissal. In that case, justice would have been delayed for far too long. Placing a faculty member on administrative leave still allows them to remain a member of the Harvard community. This should not be construed as a punishment for sexual misconduct.
Going forward, the University must be proactive rather than reactive in combating gender based misconduct and abuses of power. We appreciate FAS Dean Michael D. Smith’s call for victims and witnesses to come forward with their stories. However, messages like these cannot come only in response to headlines and missed opportunities. For victims to be willing to come forward, they must be able to trust that Harvard will take their accusations seriously from the very beginning.
The University must continually remind the community of its commitment to preventing and responding to sex and gender-based misconduct, as well as the ways in which individuals can pursue protection, support, and justice.
The bottom line is clear: Dominguez’s history of sexual misconduct and harassment on this campus is unconscionable. As he rose to various positions of power at Harvard, his accusers felt compelled to sacrifice their own educations, careers, and community—some even left. All the while, he was allowed to stay.
Though Harvard has failed to protect affiliates from Dominguez, the Chronicle’s report has offered the University an opportunity to respond to its mistakes and actively reconsider its values and policies. Justice for the accusers should be served swiftly and conclusively. Harvard must promote a different culture—one where it is not the victims of sexual misconduct but the perpetrators who feel that they have no place on this campus.

There’s a minor heatwave in Boston—according to my weather app, a high of 50 degrees and a low of 40. But I’m not convinced. I’m wearing a t-shirt, a sweatshirt, a light coat, a heavy coat, a scarf, a blanket, and a sleeping bag, but I’m so cold that my hands and nose are bright red, and I can’t read for class tomorrow because I’m too busy looking up the symptoms of hypothermia on WebMD.
WebMD tells me hypothermia starts when the core body temperature cools to 95 degrees, and while I wish a thermometer would suddenly materialize into my right hand, I hear the sloppy footsteps and laughter of drunk college students. I look out of the tiny window on my tiny door and see three girls and one guy walking down South Street having what seems to be a good time.
They walk past The Advocate’s parking lot, where I am stationed, and one of them sees me. “OMG, guys! What is that!” She points at what looks like from a distance a lime green, oversized coffin. However, it is not a coffin but a house—the self-described “World’s Smallest House”—and it is not lime green, but, according to its owner, "chromicky green." And I am inside it.
“What the fuck!” screams one of the friends as the rest laugh in unison. “What is that?”
They stumble towards me, clumsy from their inebriation and giggling. I stare at them as they approach, nervous they might try to topple over the house—like some version of cow-tipping—or worse: try and enter it. All of my limbs are asleep because I’ve contorted my body into a ball to be my own source of heat. I am defenseless.
As the bravest girl approaches the electric green structure, we lock eyes—the only visible part of my body because my scarf is wrapped around my mouth and head and my body is buried under fluffy coat and blankets.
“Holy shit, someone’s in there! Run!”
They run away, giggling wildly. I feel like the Hunchback of Notre Dame, but instead of living in a palatial Gothic cathedral in Paris, I am squatting inside an offensively green box—eight feet long and four feet wide, four feet high—on wheels in an empty parking lot.
I can already see the headlines on CNN and MSNBC: “Small Student Dies of Hypothermia in Small House.” Or maybe: “Big Cold Kills Small Girl Sleeping in the Smallest House.”
The house fits inside the van of Jeff W. Smith, the artist who built it. You can rent the house on Airbnb for the low, low price of $55 a night, and Smith will load it onto his van and deliver it wherever you request. His only rule: You can’t park it in his driveway.
It looks more like a dinghy than a house. Smith’s friend once suggested he add some flotation device to the bottom so it could be the Smallest House in the World that Floats. When I tell Smith he could make the World’s Smallest Boat, he furrows his brows in confusion. He asks me what the point would be: “Boats are already small.”
 
The house is on wheels and lighter than it looks—it’s made of recycled wood panels and only furnished with a makeshift sink and stove—so Smith easily pushes it from Memorial Hall, across Harvard Yard, down Dunster Street, and to The Advocate parking lot—the only place on campus willing to accommodate my lodgings.
While rolling the house through the yard, Smith has me pose for photos in front of the freshmen dorms. I stand on top of the house in a bizarre twist on the parental “Off to college!” pictures—celebrating not the student but the house. Tourists stare and, while I try to disappear, I glance around to see if any of my professors or acquaintances are watching. I start to resent the house, which does not feel very small at all.
In The Advocate parking lot, Smith places a big rock under the house’s back left wheel to make sure it’s level, which apparently affects the quality of sleep you get while in the house. Though that’s the only thing keeping me from rolling away overnight, he insists on pointing out the lock—as if locking me into an easily portable box would somehow make me safer.
I have two pressing problems: I need to pee very badly, and the batteries of my laptop and phone are dying.
The house technically has a toilet towards the back, though terms like “back” and “front” lose meaning in a building this small. It’s a neatly-cut hole in the floor with a litter box underneath. The toilet cover is a navy blue Frisbee. Smith warns against using the toilet, and, already sleeping one foot above the parking lot gravel in an uninsulated, unheated box, I do not want to add the lingering odor of my own urine.
While the house sort of has a bathroom, there are definitely no outlets. I need to finish a homework assignment and use my phone as an alarm for the morning. Smith built the house not as a place to live or even as an art project, but as an “experiment” to see how cramped a room could be before becoming uninhabitable. But the outlets are a deal-breaker.
I pack up my belongings, which takes 10 minutes—even though the house is small enough that my feet and arms, when stretched out, can cover the entire floor surface—because I somehow lose my phone and the keys Smith gave me. I find them both under my sleeping bag, which is under my legs, and head to Kirkland to charge my electronics for 45 minutes.
A Kirkland security guard walks through the junior common room. The sound of his clomping boots wakes me up. I sit up quickly to find my book on the floor, my computer freshly charged, and coat and scarf strewn on the couch. The guard whisper-yells, “Don’t worry, it’s not the morning yet!”
I need to go home, I think to myself. While walking out of Kirkland I realize that the home I am thinking of is the Smallest House in the World.

I wake up, my left cheek smushed against the red carpet. How did I end up on a boat? I sit up to inspect this mysterious white-paneled interior I’ve somehow ended up in. But, as I roll onto my back, I remember where I am. It feels more private waking up in this box than it did to wake up in Kirkland—even though I’m basically camping in public, the hard green shell is protecting me.
I grab my phone to check the time and find five texts from my mother, three from my sister, and two from my brother.
Mom: Jensen, I saw on Instagram that you’re sleeping in a box outside? Very worried, please text so I know you’re O.K.
Mom: It’s winter, please don’t sleep outside.
Sister: mom says ur staging a political protest by sleeping outside. i mean u do u but that sounds dangerous, lmk ur safe
Brother: don’t be an idiot, don’t sleep outside, and text mom back, she’s freaking out
Before I fall back asleep, I take a selfie and send it to my mom so she knows I am safe.
The sun, soft and bright, shines through the six Pyrex pie dishes that serve as windows and gently wakes me up. The house feels warmer, and though I know the temperature rose about six degrees since the night, I chalk this up to my acclimation to the weather.
I sit up and curl my legs underneath me while I play music and check my emails. A Ford drives into the lot and parks across from the house. A woman wearing a camel coat emerges from the car and, as she walks to the back seat to grab her purse, catches my house out of the corner of her eye. She does a double-take and just stands, her arms dangling by her sides, gawking at my portable home.
I am outraged. This woman, with her heated car seat and fossil fuel-guzzling station wagon is the weird one, not me. There’s nothing crazy about this: I’m just a small girl in a small house. So I gawk back.
Smith explained that he once did the calculations and figured out that “the house is more famous, per square foot, than the Taj Mahal.” As the woman retreats under my unrelenting gaze, I think about this. That’s right, you heat-dilettante, this famous and lovely house and I will not quail under the scorn that comes with your normal-sized belongings.
After rolling the house up a small sloped driveway, holding it in place while Smith moves his van towards the base of the hill, and then guiding it up the makeshift ramp into the van, the Smallest House in the World and I officially part ways.
I walk to class, wearing the leggings and t-shirt I slept in, my hair visibly uncombed. Despite my disheveled appearance, I walk with the confidence of someone who is one of five people to have slept in the Smallest House in the World.
I slide my left hand into my pocket, like I see the cool people in movies do, and feel something hard and metal. It’s the key to my house.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University plans to build a new childcare facility in Allston, the first expansion in decades, according to Judith D. Singer, vice provost for faculty development and diversity.
Singer said in a February interview the decision was prompted by the concerns of professors in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
“A lot of the credit for pushing that forward, in addition to the people in the central administration wanting it, was the Engineering school,” Singer said. “And the faculty, both women and men in the engineering school, who very much wanted to have on-campus childcare which is good for both women and men.”
The decision to build a new childcare center arrives as SEAS, Harvard’s youngest and fastest growing school, prepares its long-awaited move to Allston in the fall of 2020.
Singer said that family-centered initiatives like the childcare center began as efforts to help women affiliated with the University achieve a better work-life balance.
Work-life balance has proved a source of tension between the University and faculty, graduate students, and staff with families for years. Some have argued childcare services are unaffordable and cater more to professors with higher salaries than graduate students and staff.
Demand for centers like the planned one in Allston remains high. In 2015, the six existing childcare centers offered about 400 daycare slots for the entire University. An individual center, though, sometimes receives requests for 500 slots.
Costs exacerbate the problem, even for those who do get the spots: some centers can charge around $20,000 to 25,000 a year for one child, according to Harvard Human Resources’ website.
Singer said policies in the last 10 or 15 years, many of which resulted from task forces on women, have ameliorated the issue.
“We now have a whole variety of policies, medical leave for women who give birth, parental leave, tenure clock extensions—those are gender neutral—and childcare subsidies, which make it possible to not worry about being able to afford childcare,” she said.
Physics professor Matthew D. Schwartz wrote in an email he thinks the new center will greatly mitigate demand for childcare, despite high costs.
“If a Harvard employee wants to pay $3000/month for childcare, they should at least have the opportunity to do so,” he wrote. “So by all means, opening more centers to saturate the demand should be a high priority and I am strongly in favor of the center in Allston.”
According to Singer, the University spends about a million dollars a year for childcare.
Singer added that she thought these policies all gained traction as a part of the University’s increasing emphasis on women, which she said would not have been possible without the increased presence of female faculty.
“The University now does things there were unthinkable 20 years ago,” she said. “Unthinkable—we wouldn’t have thought that to be an important component because if you don’t have a lot of female faculty, you’re not going to make that kind of commitment. So it’s a big shift.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern and the Cambridge Community Foundation announced the creation of the Cambridge Legal Defense Fund for Immigrants in a press conference Monday afternoon.
The initiative grants money to nonprofits that provide legal services to immigrants. The fund focuses on helping immigrants that are especially vulnerable like DACA recipients, asylum seekers, victims of sexual violence, and families with minors, President of the Cambridge Community Foundation Geeta Pradhan said Monday.
After the Trump administration’s decision to end programs that protect immigrants like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status, thousands of undocumented individuals are currently at risk of deportation. David Mijares, the director of the Somerville Boys and Girls Club, is himself a DACA recipient. At the press conference, he urged people to act in the face of anti-immigrant policies.
“The time for talk is over. Let’s do something about it,” Mijares said. “I’m tired of people’s fear being used as a catalyst for hate. I’m tired of the ignorance being spread by short-sighted views. I’m tired of the limbo my life is in.”
Pradhan similarly stressed the pressure placed on immigrants and their families because of the Trump administration’s repeals.
“We don’t have time to lose. The urgency of this issue—it is immediate. People are losing their families. They’re getting torn apart,” Pradhan said. “We need to do something, we need to act, and we really need to act now.”
Leslie T. DiTrani, an immigration attorney at DiTrani Law in Boston, agreed that deportation is an issue now central to many immigrants’ lives.
“Our immigrant communities have not been this vulnerable since World War II. I have not seen this level of fear across everyone in our communities since a very long time,” DiTrani said at the press conference.
According to the Cambridge Community Foundation’s website, only 14 percent of all detained immigrants have access to a lawyer. Yet detained immigrants are four times more likely to be released if they have access to legal counsel, DiTrani said.
“Having an immigration attorney is critical to our immigrants being able to access the justice that we just take for granted,” she said.
DiTrani is also a member of the Cambridge Commission on Immigrant Rights and Citizenship, which the city established in 2016 to work with other city bodies to provide free monthly legal consultations for immigrants.
Executive Director of CIRC Nancy B. Schlacter wrote in an emailed statement that the new legal defense fund is another way the city will work to help immigrants.
The city of Cambridge has a history of supporting immigrants in opposition to recent changes to federal immigration policies. Last March, the City Council voted in favor of withdrawing from federal immigration enforcement training.
Cambridge also maintained its sanctuary city status in Mar. 2017 despite threats of grant cuts from the Department of Justice. This status, which allows undocumented Cantabrigians to live without fear of deportation, should also come with tangible steps to protect immigrants, McGovern said.
“Although the symbolism of being a sanctuary city is important because it makes it clear that Cambridge is a city that respects all who live here and is a place where all immigrants—undocumented or documented—can be safe, symbolism itself is not enough,” McGovern said at the press conference.
McGovern emphasized the role of local governments in standing against what he referred to as the federal government’s “xenophobic” policies.
“The White House and Congress may be failing to act, failing to protect our fellow residents who are American in every way except on paper, but Cambridge cannot fail to act,” McGovern said. “Cambridge and other municipalities across the state must take steps to ensure that all our residents are protected from the harsh policies coming out of Washington.”
Boston instituted a similar measure last year. Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh established an immigration defense fund to provide monetary support for immigrants in Sept. 2017, the Boston Globe reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Crimson Corner left its location at the intersection of Massachusetts Ave, JFK St., and Brattle St. over a year ago, national pizza chain &pizza has sought to secure the necessary approval to open.
In the meantime, the space has sat alongside a number of empty storefronts and new chain locations throughout the Square—and it has drawn attention to changing business dynamics in the area.
High turnover in the Square in recent years has left some storefronts without operating businesses. Prominently featured storefronts—like those that once housed UNO Pizzeria on JFK St., the closed CVS on Mass. Ave., and the Harvard Square Theater on Brattle St.—remain empty.
HBS lecturer John D. Macomber believes the Square is currently undergoing growing pains. Because large shopping malls attract buyers looking for high-priced items—and high-volume, low-priced products have become increasingly available online—Harvard Square’s businesses are stuck somewhere in the middle, according to Macomber.
“If you think about who makes up the Harvard Square foot traffic—largely students and tourists who are not spending a lot of money—it’s easy to see why coffee shops, ice cream places, ATMs and ‘fast casual’ food and coffee shops dominate,” Macomber said.
These changes and vacancies have not always sat well with residents, though. When the &pizza announced plans to open in 2017, many Cambridge residents feared the store would negatively impact the nature of the Square.
At the time, Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, commended &pizza for working with community leaders and government officials to gain approval. She noted that the chair of the Board of Zoning Appeals, who rarely supports the opening of fast food chains in the Square, voted in support of the proposal.
Jillson continues to support &pizza’s plans and believes the chain will open “before too long.”
“They went in front of the license commission last Wednesday and they were applying for their CB and their application for their outside patio,” Jillson said.
African and African American Studies and History of Art and Architecture professor Suzanne P. Blier, a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said she fears the opening of chains like &pizza is part of a negative trend.
“One of the key things is that national chains can afford to pay much higher rent and one by one they’re pricing out local businesses,” Blier said. “Local businesses tend to pay their employees more, and they are part of the community.”
Jillson pointed to a slew of restaurants and stores slated to open in the Square in the near future as proof that many of the apparent vacancies in the Square are temporary.
“We really aren’t seeing many more vacancies,” Jillson said. “The number [of vacancies] doesn’t change a lot. It ranges between 94 or 97 percent occupied. Under any circumstances that’s a terrific number and one that we’re really proud of.”
As for chains in the Square, Jillson explained that the Harvard Square Business Association does monitor the number of chains at any given time, with locally-owned businesses usually numbering around 70 to 72 percent.
She emphasized that recent vacancies were not caused by the departure of local businesses but rather by chains.
“In the past couple or three years the vast number of businesses that have left Harvard Square have been international or nationals,” Jillson said. “It may be indicative that the consumer in Harvard Square might have a preference for locally owned businesses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 6, 2018 at 1:50 a.m. 
A three-alarm fire broke out Monday evening at 50 Follen St., an apartment building occupied in part by Harvard graduate students, and raged for roughly half an hour before firefighters were able to stop the blaze.
Acting chief of the Cambridge Fire Department Gerry Mahoney said the fire started around 8:30 p.m. Monday evening and that fire department personnel arrived on the scene almost immediately.
“I’d say the fire was pretty well knocked out about 20 to 30 minutes into it,” Mahoney said at a press briefing at roughly 10:30 p.m. Monday. “This is something these guys and girls train on. They drill constantly.”
Mahoney said the fire caused no injuries and that every resident of the building was “accounted for” as of late Monday evening. He said the blaze remained confined to the top floor and called resultant damage to the penthouse area “quite significant.”
As a result of the fire, roughly 10 units—out of a total 96 units housing over 200 occupants—are uninhabitable at least for Monday night, according to Mahoney. He said the cause of the fire is still under investigation, though the department’s understanding as of Monday night is that the blaze probably started in the penthouse area.
Mahoney added the fire department is currently working with Cambridge’s emergency management office as well as the Red Cross and utility companies to ensure those ten units come “back in operation” as soon as possible.
The fire chief said he expects the displaced owners of the 10 damaged units will be able to find housing for the night at local hotels via arrangements made through the Red Cross. Mahoney added he was unable to estimate the likely cost to repair damage caused by the fire.
As of roughly 9:45 p.m., no fire was visible from the street, but many firefighters remained, some of them working atop the roof of the building. At least ten fire trucks had arrived at Follen St. around that same time.
Three alarms had been ordered for the fire as of roughly 9:15 p.m., according to the Twitter feed of the Cambridge Fire Department.
“Progress report on 3rd alarm on 3-63, command reports fire knocked down, extensive overhauling,” the department tweeted at approximately 9:20 p.m.
Bystanders at the scene said they were surprised to see the fire break out.
“My first reaction was that it’s one of the other false alarms so I just ran out, kind of reluctantly,” said Artan Sheshmani, who said he lives on the third floor of the apartment building that caught fire. “It’s a rare incident but it was a good opportunity for us to see how friendly people in the neighborhood are.”
Sheshmani said that, as soon as residents began to exit the apartment building to huddle together on the street in the “freezing” cold, nearby neighbors came to help.
“This jacket is actually not mine, someone called Deborah gave me this jacket,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is launching an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment by Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez—an inquiry that may take shape as a Title IX investigation per Faculty of Arts and Sciences sexual harassment procedures.
A few days after The Chronicle of Higher Education published new accusations against Dominguez, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed him on “administrative leave." FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an email Sunday that FAS will conduct an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment from 10 women that together span three decades.
“I write to announce that the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) has placed Jorge Dominguez on administrative leave, pending a full and fair review of the facts and circumstances regarding allegations that have come to light,” Smith wrote.
Harvard administrators have asked students and faculty who have experienced harassment to come forward and share their experiences.
“We encourage any member of our community who has experienced inappropriate behavior to come forward,” FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in a statement to The Crimson.
Asked who will be carrying out the review of Dominguez, Cowenhoven directed The Crimson to the FAS Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedures.
The full policy contains a nearly seven-page section devoted to outlining response procedures to formal complaints against faculty members alleged to be in violation of the University’s Title IX policies, which prohibit sex or gender discrimination including sexual harassment.
The policy specifically prohibits the behavior the women quoted in the Chronicle’s story alleged Dominguez exhibited toward them, including inappropriate touching and unwanted advances. The women who spoke to the Chronicle comprised both former students and a junior faculty member under Dominguez's mentorship.
“In the academic context, sexual harassment often involves the inappropriate personal attention by an instructor or other officer who is in a position to exercise professional power over another individual,” the policy reads.
The document also notes that sexual harassment can occur between “persons of the same University status.”
“An example would be persistent personal attention from one colleague to another in the face of repeated rejection of such attention,” the policy says. “Both types of harassment are unacceptable. They seriously undermine the atmosphere of trust essential to the academic enterprise.”
The document outlines two avenues for resolving sexual harassment cases: informal resolutions and formal complaints. In the informal resolution process, FAS Title IX coordinators or University Title IX administrators work with both parties to settle on a “mutually acceptable resolution.”
Formal complaints are filed through the University’s Office for Dispute Resolution, which initiates official investigations. FAS refers complaints it receives through its Title IX coordinators to ODR.
There no time limit for submitting a formal complaint and initiating an investigation into a violation, though FAS encourages complainants to file grievances “as soon as reasonably possible” after experiencing an alleged policy violation.
All of the specific allegations in the Chronicle of Higher Education story took place beyond the state of Massachusetts’s 300-day window between the time of the incident and the time claims must be filed to guarantee consideration. Harvard’s policy, however, still allows even the oldest claims to be investigated.
The FAS policies and procedures also deal with the issue of complainants who do not wish to participate in formal investigations, or who wish to do so anonymously. Several sources in the Chronicle of Higher Education story were unwilling to reveal their names publicly.
If the women who allege they were harassed by Dominguez decline to participate in a formal Title IX investigation, it is more difficult for the University to confirm these accusations.
If complainants refuse to take part in the investigation, the University must determine whether the allegations indicate sufficiently reprehensible behavior or create a hostile environment for others in order to proceed with an investigation anyway.
Despite the University’s ability to investigate allegations without the complainant’s participation, Colby Bruno, a lawyer with the Victim’s Rights Law Center, said such cases often end up “dying out.”
“When a school is not faced with the pressure of a victim—and a victim wanting to do something—then the school feels no pressure and wants it to go away,” Bruno said. “If someone ever comes to them and says, ‘Why didn’t you investigate it,’ they can say the victim didn’t want to; people would say, ‘Okay, fine.’”
Difficulties also arise during investigations when complainants wish to remain anonymous. FAS’s policies and procedures indicate that requests for anonymity can sometimes result in Harvard deciding to close the case without completing the inquiry. There are also circumstances in which Title IX officers may deem it necessary to disclose the complainant’s identity for certain parts of the investigative process.
Bruno said that, though anonymous complaints are difficult to investigate, they still allow for continued pressure on the University.
“If you have a victim who wants to continue with [anonymity], that is where the school remains obligated to remedy the hostile environment because the student can continue to talk to the school, continue to be involved in it,” Bruno said. “That’s the kind of stuff that I think that doesn’t happen when the victim just says, ‘I don’t want to do this.’”
Administrators have repeatedly pointed to the Title IX policy and procedures and encouraged students and faculty with complaints of sexual harassment to disclose their stories to Title IX administrators. Title IX Coordinator Emily Miller specifically presented about Harvard's Title IX policies at a meeting for Government concentrators about the Dominguez allegations Friday.
The University has not revealed whether administrators are currently building a Title IX case against Dominguez. University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email that she cannot comment on the existence of a complaint or investigation within the ODR.
“In accordance with the privacy and confidentiality required by the University’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and Procedures, we cannot confirm or deny the existence of an ODR complaint regarding any matter,” deLuzuriaga wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 8, 2018 at 6:06 a.m.
Several professors, teaching fellows, and advisers in the Government Department reached out to students with messages of support and calls to join discussions about departmental climate in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez.
The Chronicle of Higher Education published a Feb. 27 article reporting that least 10 women are accusing Dominguez of various acts of sexual harassment perpetrated over the past 30 years. In a second Chronicle article published Sunday, eight more women stepped forward to accuse Dominguez of sexual misconduct. That same day, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced the FAS had placed Dominguez on “administrative leave.”
On Friday, the Government department held a meeting for concentrators with departmental and Title IX administrators to debrief about the allegations. Professors and graduate students, though, have also taken it upon themselves to discuss the situation in recent days.
Naima N. M. Green, a graduate student in the Government department and tutor in Adams House, sent an email Sunday about the issue to students she teaches and advises.
“As a grad student in the department, I've found this issue—and aspects of the response to it—upsetting and difficult to deal with,” Green wrote.
“If any of you are struggling with this, or with other such issues surrounding sexual harassment, I'd encourage you to reach out. This isn't something that anyone should have to deal with alone,” Green added.
Government Department teaching fellow and Mather House tutor David Ifkovits also sent an email to students in Mather.
“From personal conversations, I know that many of you have been concerned about the way the Department has been handling these allegations,” Ifkovits wrote on Friday. “Please reach out to me at any time if you want to discuss your own experience related to this issue.”
Ifkovits said in an interview that at a meeting of “about 50 to 60” Government Department graduate students in an informal “diversity working group,” the group designated Ifkovits and teaching fellow and Quincy House tutor Meredith Dost as “liaisons” to Government concentrators on issues of sexual harassment.
Faculty in the Government Department already have a “Climate Working Group” to examine gender issues in the department, according to Ifkovits.
Ifkovits said the graduate students in the working group are currently circulating a letter about the department’s gender climate that they plan to publish soon, with signatures from professors.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 8, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that The Chronicle of Higher Education published a Feb. 26 article reporting that least 10 women are accusing Dominguez of various acts of sexual harassment perpetrated over the past 30 years. In fact, the Chronicle published that article on Feb. 27.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Artists, poets, and musicians joined a group of Harvard students, faculty, and staff as well as affiliates from other universities at Memorial Church Monday to support Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients affected by recent federal decisions on immigration.
The event, titled “A Day of Hope and Resistance,” was part of Harvard’s DACA Seminar, which began in February and will run through April. The day-long event consisted of workshops, performances, and a candlelight vigil.
Monday marked the deadline set by the Trump administration for Congress to pass protections for undocumented people and the last day for DACA recipients to apply to renew their status. That deadline, though, is essentially moot after two court decisions halted the administration's termination of the program. Still, DACA recipients at Harvard and the country are concerned about potential lapses in their legal status.
Graduate School of Education professor Roberto G. Gonzales, who helped organized the event, encouraged DACA recipients to speak up.
“The [Trump] administration has said that undocumented immigrants in this country should be afraid,”  Gonzales said. “With the political discourse from the campaign trail, through the election, through all of the executive orders, from the travel ban through the ending of DACA and TPS, is the creation of fear by design.”
“Communities are very aware that a walk in the park, playing basketball on a local playground, that sitting on a stoop could land someone today in detention or deportation procedures,” Gonzales added.
The event was intended to give people affected by Trump’s repeal of DACA an opportunity for personal expression.
“Because we know that this day has been such a source of anxiety and uncertainty for the millions of families that it affects, we here on campus wanted to create a space of community and strength and creativity,” said Kirsten A. Weld, an associate professor of History, who helped organize the event. “What’s going to be needed in order to fight the criminalization of immigrants in our communities is creativity and coalition building.”
Savannah J. Miles ’18, emphasized the importance of the event being held at a location central to Harvard’s identity.
“I think there’s something especially moving about the fact that it’s in Memorial Church, which is this iconic Harvard structure that seems to represent the mores of Harvard,” Miles said. “To have this day of resistance in this location is pretty inspiring. It shows that there is hope for the changes that people are trying to make here and that Harvard will stand behind this.”
RodStarz—a member of the hip hop group Rebel Diaz—ran a workshop early in the day about hip hop and immigration and praised Harvard’s decision to organize such an event.
“From an outsider’s perspective, Harvard is world-renowned as being a top educational institution,” he said. “For a school this prestigious to have not just a day, but a whole seminar dedicated to DACA is very timely and important.”

The University will continue to pay Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez while he is on “administrative leave” for allegedly sexually harassing women in the Government department, according to Anna Cowenhoven, a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email Sunday that FAS placed Dominguez on leave “pending a full and fair review of the facts and circumstances.” In his email, Smith cited allegations against Dominguez first reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education in a Feb. 27 article.
In that article, at least 10 women accused Dominguez of sexually harassing them at various points across the last 30 years.
Though Dominguez will retain his tenure, he will not be able to teach or perform other administrative duties while on leave, Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement Monday.
Dominguez is currently on sabbatical this semester, though he also serves as chair of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies. He is also a senior adviser to the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, where he worked as director from 1995 to 2006.
Other Ivy League schools have seen professors accused of sexual misconduct in recent months—prompting universities to respond in different ways.
After multiple students alleged that three tenured professors at Dartmouth created a “hostile academic environment in which sexual harassment is normalized” in Nov. 2017, the University placed the professors on paid leave, according to The Dartmouth. The professors have restricted access to campus while investigators continue their work, the Dartmouth reported.
Princeton also responded to sexual harassment allegations after a Title IX investigation found that electrical engineering professor Sergio Verdú had violated the University’s policy on sex discrimination and sexual misconduct last June. According to the Daily Princetonian, Verdú will be allowed to keep his job after attending an eight-hour training session.
The last time Harvard publicly placed a professor on leave was in 2011. Psychology professor Marc D. Hauser resigned from his tenured position at the University after an internal FAS investigation found Hauser “solely responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct.”

UPDATED: March 6, 2018 at 6:50 p.m.
Almost seven years after it first opened, Harvard’s Innovation Lab is looking to expand its management team to address growing interest in entrepreneurship on campus.
The i-lab is a center for innovation and entrepreneurship which opened in Nov. 2011 next to the Business School in Allston. The i-lab is open to all full-time University students. In 2012, the i-lab hosted over 55 resident teams, which have access to the lab’s space and resources.
As part of the expansion of its management team, the i-lab has created multiple openings this year for new director-level jobs, including a director of marketing and a director of operations.  The center also promoted its former associate director of technology to director of programming as a part of this restructuring.
Jodi Goldstein, executive director of the i-lab, said increasing interest in entrepreneurship and innovation on campus spurred the creation of these new positions.
Goldstein said the organization is looking for people with “deep” experience in operations and management for both the marketing and operations positions.
“We’re being very selective in our hiring process,” she said. “The culture we’ve created at the i-lab is very important to us, and something where we want to make sure continues as we scale the organization.”
Goldstein compared the culture of the i-lab to that of a “well-resourced” start-up organization, adding she believes the i-lab will be able to stay “nimble” even after the expansion of its management team.
Unique to the i-lab, according to Goldstein, is its “safe and transparent” culture that allows for “experimentation and failure.”
“We believe that in order to solve these complex problems, you do need a diversity of viewpoints. So a lot of what we work on in the i-lab is what we like to call, ‘structured serendipity,’ where we bring students who otherwise may not have met, and then help them take their ideas as far as they can go,” she said.
For Goldstein, the path to addressing growing demand for innovation and entrepreneurship at the i-lab is twofold: increasing access and impact.
“Access includes serving and reaching more students, faculty, and alumni around the university, and impact is what we do when they come to us, and how we can help them reach their milestones no matter which stage of the journey they are on,” she said.  “And in doing both, in scaling access and impact, it’s going to take a lot more leadership.”
Elaborating on this model, Goldstein remarked on the “unrealized value” the i-lab can provide to undergraduate students ignorant of the glass-facade center across the river.
“I’d like 100 percent of Harvard students to feel welcome and included in the i-lab ecosystem,” Goldstein said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Allston residents and planning officials discussed the impact of community projects financed by a Harvard-sponsored fund over the last two years during a meeting Monday.
The $5.35 million “flexible fund” is part of a larger 10-year community benefits package Harvard bequeathed to Allston in 2013, when the University sought city approval to develop its Allston property. The total package is worth $43 million.
To date, the Boston Planning and Development Agency—which manages the flexible fund—has allocated more than two million dollars of the $5.35 million for community improvement projects in Allston.
The goal of Monday’s meeting was to review the progress of projects supported by the fund.
Cathy Baker-Eclipse, a member of the Boston Parks and Recreation Department, presented on a project intended to improve Smith Playground by incorporating a new amphitheater and water spray.
Baker-Eclipse said the flexible fund helped cover around two million dollars of the five million dollar project. Other sources of funding included surplus from the Boston City’s snow removal budget and money from Boston College’s Neighborhood Improvement Fund.
Gerald Autler, a senior project manager at the Boston Planning and Development Agency, called the Smith Playground improvement project “high-impact.”
“I don’t think we’ll give another grant of this magnitude,” Autler said.
Autler attributed the success of this project to “the ability to start to improve this largely significant neighborhood improvement sooner.”
Shawn Burns, a Boston police sergeant, also presented on an initiative to buy four message boards for the Allston-Brighton police departments at the meeting.
“From the police standpoint and from input from the community, these boards have been extremely effective,” Burns said.
The Boston police department first submitted the $96,000 proposal for the boards in 2016, which were eventually purchased for $62,000. The grant from the flexible fund allowed the department to incorporate these boards into its operations, according to Burns.
The message boards can display customized messages and track and analyze traffic and speed data. A software package purchased separately allows the police department to program the boards remotely.
Burns said Boston Calling, a music festival occuring this May, would be an opportunity to utilize these boards for traffic and crowd control.
Lastly, local resident Karen Chang discussed a project to restore Herter Park, which used a $50,000 grant from the flexible fund. The Friends of Herter Park, the organization that spearheaded the restoration, received the flex-fund grant in spring 2016.
Autler said the restoration project is an example of how small amounts from the flexible fund can lead to substantial improvements in the community.
“In the context of the $5.3 million fund, this was not a massive investment, but one that has brought this resource back to life,” he said. “[It is] a great example of what we can do with 50,000—the kind of thing I’d like to see a lot more of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College Faith and Action will not lose the ability to book rooms, recruit students, or receive Undergraduate Council funding as part of its year-long probation imposed by the College, according to the group’s parent ministry and messages obtained by The Crimson.
In late February, the College announced it had put HCFA on probation for 12 months after the religious group asked a woman in a same-sex relationship to step down from a leadership position in Sept. 2017. Administrators have repeatedly refused to say whether probation means HCFA has lost privileges accorded to recognized student groups, including the ability to reserve College spaces, poster on campus, and participate in activity fairs.
Now, though, Harvard officials seem to have decided HCFA’s probation will have little immediate practical effect.
“It has been confirmed that the probation status of HCFA means no loss of privileges from Harvard College itself in the form of room booking and student outreach,” Christian Union—HCFA’s parent group—wrote on a website page titled “Harvard Recognition Blog.”
HCFA held its weekly worship event, Doxa, last Friday—post probation—in Yenching Auditorium, a Harvard space.
The Office of Student Life also told UC leadership that HCFA was not banned from Council funding per the Office’s policies, according to UC group messages obtained by The Crimson.
“Apparently HCFA is not actually banned from UC Funding per the OSL,” Henry S. Atkins ’20, UC finance committee chair, wrote in a message to the committee last week. “Next week, I will ask for a vote on whether or not that should be the case.”
The Council previously thought probation meant HCFA was automatically barred from receiving funds from the UC’s finance committee. Operating under this belief, members voted down a measure that would have prevented the religious group from receiving any Council funding last week.
Atkins said in an interview Monday night he plans to bring forward legislation barring HCFA from receiving all UC funding at a finance committee policy meeting slated to be held Wednesday evening.
“Why the OSL is deciding not to follow [the probationary UC funding ban] in this case I don’t know, I think they certainly should be,” Atkins said. “I think absent their action on this, what we should be doing is we should be trying to make sure [HCFA is] not being funded until they leave administrative probation.”
In an emailed statement Monday, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller declined to comment on the specifics of HCFA’s probation.
“We are working closely with the leadership of HCFA to ensure that they are in compliance with all of Harvard’s policies with respect to recognized student organizations,” he wrote. “While we will not discuss specific details regarding discipline of students or organizations, we look forward to continuing our work and dialogue with HCFA.”
Miller did not answer a question asking whether Christian Union is correct in asserting HCFA has not lost room booking or student outreach privileges as a result of its probation. Christian Union representatives did not respond to a request for comment.
The Office of Student Life website currently defines the consequences of probation only for recognized student organizations who have failed to complete the mandatory annual renewal of their College recognition. The office places those groups on semester-long probation and revokes privileges including the ability to reserve campus spaces and receive funding from the UC and College offices, according to the website.
Administrators previously told HCFA leadership that the religious group was the first-ever campus organization to be placed on "administrative probation."
Harvard’s decision to put HCFA on probation came after the Office found that HCFA had behaved in a manner “grossly inconsistent” with College guidelines for recognized groups, Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an email last month. College spokesperson Rachael Dane previously said HCFA will need to sever ties with Christian Union in order to regain recognized status.
The Office of Student Life “was alerted to a situation in December” regarding HCFA and has been “reviewing” the organization ever since, Goldman wrote in the Feb. 2018 statement.
HCFA’s co-presidents Scott Ely ’18 and Molly L. Richmond ’18 did not respond to a request for comment.
In earlier statements, Ely and Richmond maintained HCFA never fell out of compliance with Harvard’s non-discrimination guidelines.
“We reject any notion that we discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in our fellowship,” the co-presidents wrote in an email in February. “Broadly speaking, the student in this case was removed because of an irreconcilable theological disagreement pertaining to our character standards.”
On its website, Christian Union called the probation “an unfortunate action” taken against “one of the most popular student organizations on campus.” With roughly 200 members, HCFA is the largest Christian fellowship at Harvard.

Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez announced Tuesday he will retire from his teaching job at the end of the semester and that he is immediately resigning from his administrative roles, several days after at least 18 women publicly accused him of sexual harassment.
“I am retiring from my job at Harvard at the end of this semester,” Dominguez wrote in an email to colleagues Tuesday. “I have stepped down immediately from my role at the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies and my other very few remaining academic coordinating roles.”
Chair of the Government department Jennifer L. Hochschild shared Dominguez’s message with department affiliates in an email Tuesday afternoon. She wrote Dominguez’s retirement will not affect Harvard’s ongoing attempts to investigate allegations of sexual harassment made against the professor. The rights and privileges normally provided to retired faculty members will take into account the outcome of the University's investigation, according to FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven.
The University placed Dominguez on “administrative leave” Sunday evening.
“I want to underscore that Professor Dominguez is currently on administrative leave, and his forthcoming retirement does not change the ongoing review of the facts and circumstances that have come to light,” Hochschild wrote in her email.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith also wrote that Dominguez's retirement "does not change the full and fair process of review" in an emailed statement Tuesday. Smith added that Dominguez will remain on leave until the review is concluded.
The Chronicle of Higher Education published a Feb. 27 article revealing that at least 10 women were alleging Dominguez had committed repeated acts of sexual harassment across the past three decades. The Chronicle published a second piece Sunday in which more women came forward to accuse Dominguez of sexual misconduct, bringing the total count of possible victims to 18 women.
While on administrative leave, Dominguez will continue to receive a salary but will not allowed to fulfill any of his teaching and administrative duties, according to FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven.
At the monthly Faculty meeting Tuesday, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said he encourages members and affiliates of FAS who have suffered sexual harassment to come forward and share their stories with one of the Title IX Coordinators.
“I now want to turn to our broader commitments and state unequivocally that the FAS will not tolerate sexual harassment,” Smith said. “I encourage anyone who has witnessed sexual harassment in the FAS, recently or in the past, to come forward and share their experiences with one of the FAS Title IX Coordinators.”
University President Drew. G Faust also spoke about the recent sexual harassment allegations against Dominguez at the meeting Tuesday. She said the University “very clearly” has more work to do.
“We need to acknowledge and work to address the cultural and structural realities that permit sexual harassment to occur. We need to acknowledge the profound influence members of the faculty have over junior faculty and students,” Faust said. “All of us in this room share a responsibility to act in ways that acknowledge this imbalance of power.”
Faust highlighted several University initiatives meant to combat sexual harassment. She cited the  Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the presence of Title IX coordinators as examples of the University’s “integrated, professionalized and robust system” to address issues of sexual harassment. 
Before Faculty administrators took action, the new and resurfaced allegations prompted Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 to send an email to Harvard affiliates Friday afternoon reaffirming the University’s commitment to “a safe, healthy and non-discriminatory educational and work environment.” Garber also called for affiliates who have experienced sexual harassment to come forward and speak to Title IX officers.
In the days before Dominguez’s retirement, many undergraduates and graduate students called for his removal.
Dominguez started teaching at Harvard in 1972 after earning his Ph.D. the same year and received tenure in 1979. The first case of sexual misconduct perpetrated by Dominguez reported by the Chronicle occurred that same year, when a former undergraduate alleges the professor repeatedly touched her and tried to kiss her.
In the early 1980s, Dominguez made repeated sexual advances towards former assistant professor Terry L. Karl and another graduate student in the department. Both women reported the incidents to administrators, prompting then-Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky to sanction Dominguez in 1984 by removing him from the administrative positions he then held.
Just one year after the 1984 punishment, though, Dominguez was appointed to chair both the FAS Foreign Cultures subcommittee of the Core Curriculum and the Special Appointments Committee in the Government department.
Between 1995 to 2006, Dominguez served as the director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs; following this, he became Harvard’s first vice provost for international affairs, a position he held from 2006 to 2015.
Weatherhead Center director Michèle Lamont released a statement on Friday in response to the initial Chronicle article. She encouraged affiliates to reach out to Harvard personnel and Title IX officers.
Dominguez’s various promotions across the years came as undergraduates, graduate students, and junior faculty alike were sexually harassed by the professor, according to their allegations in the Chronicle. The most recent of these allegations dates from 2015.
Though Dominguez was on sabbatical this semester before Smith placed him on leave, he taught two undergraduate classes in fall 2017, including a seminar whose enrollment was restricted to College freshmen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David Ryan was never supposed to win the 2018 College Squash Association (CSA) national individual championship. Nor was he supposed to be in the finals, semifinals, quarterfinals, or even the opening round.
Coming into the weekend, he was ranked 18th in the country and only secured his spot by virtue of other players dropping from the season’s last competition. But on a weekend where six Harvard athletes made it to the national semifinals, the Dublin native saved two championship points to capture the 36th men’s title in program history with a 12-10 fifth-game victory.
If the title wasn’t enough, the journey to his championship made the run all the sweeter. Seeded 14th in the bracket, Harvard’s co-captain began his run by dispatching Penn’s No. 1 Andrew Douglas in four games before barreling through Dartmouth top-seed Alvin Heumann in straight games.
This set up a matchup against teammate, but now opponent, Timmy Brownell in the semifinal. After trading the first four games in a tight contest, Ryan was able to escape to final game, 11-7, to grab a spot in the final against top overall seed and former occupant of the pro circuit, Trinity’s Kush Kumar.
“It was great having the four Harvard boys down there,” Ryan said. “Three of us got to the semifinals, which is a great achievement, in general, for all of us as a team, especially after the disappointment of last weekend when we got picked to the post by Trinity in the team championship final.”
The whole weekend was new territory for Ryan. Besides Brownell, he had never played any of the other three.
“I was inexperienced going in against these guys, but the thing was that they also hadn’t played me, so they didn’t really know what to expect,” Ryan said. “Maybe I got them a little bit nervous, when it came down to it.”
On Sunday, at the George Washington University courts in the nation’s capital, Ryan triggered the upset alarm by winning the first, and then the second game of the national final, by relatively easy margins. If Kumar—the overwhelming favorite—was rattled, it was hard to see as he took the third and fourth games in decisive fashion. Ryan’s season and career, along with one last shot at glory, came down to one final game to 11.
The two kept each other in check early in the game, but Kumar began to pull away and arrived at the precipice of a national championship leading 10-8. The Bantam needed just just one more point to win it all, but that never came.
“I was a couple of match balls down and I was just in that sort of mindset that I really didn’t want to lose, no matter what,” Ryan said. “I was going to leave it all out there. It’s my last ever college squash match, probably squash match in general.”
Ryan won four straight points, including two title-saving strokes, to flip the script.
The pro-turned-freshman Kumar still has three more chances at an individual title, along with the team national championship already in his pocket after Trinity’s home victory against Harvard. Meanwhile, Ryan can graduate with a personal accolade that he hardly knew was possible to win.
This is the second year in a row that Harvard has come away with an individual national championship from a player that did not play primarily on the top rung of the ladder. Last season, then-freshman Gina Kennedy came away with a national title after beating top-seeded Reeham Sedky.
Kennedy could hardly claim the role of an underdog this year in the singles championship, despite being ranked second behind the Penn junior, as she looked to defend her title. Nor could the rest of the Harvard women’s team stay away from the spotlight, who after sweeping the team national championship 9-0 against Trinity, traveled eight of its top players to the tournament and served as a model of performance and consistency.
“We’re such a small team so it was so important to stay injury-free and I think the team did that so well,” said co-captain Sue Ann Yong.
After the end of Friday’s action, it was easy to be impressed by Harvard’s results across the two competition divisions. Both the men and women were able to place three players in the championship semifinals, and therefore each have one representative in the final.
But while it was surprising to see three Cambridge men in the semifinal, the chances of a national championship had to look better for the three four-time defending national championship Harvard women, fresh off an undefeated season. The match-ups were compelling and the history real. Longtime star junior Sabrina Sobhy had a Saturday date against Sedky, with a possible championship rematch looming a day later with Kennedy and “The Hammer,” or a glorified challenged match to decide the national title.
“It was nice because I think most people had different matches than they did during the regular season, so they were playing different people and we could still support each other,” Yong said.
Sedky ended up easily dispatching Sobhy in straight games, while Kennedy warded off teammate, classmate, and fellow British national Amelia Henley in five games. Similarities abounded during the weekend—Henley was trying to channel some of her own No. 4 slot magic to match Ryan. But Kennedy, who, like Ryan, won the first two games in the national final last year as a heavy underdog, ended back up in the championship game.
So the rematch began, Penn’s top-ranked against Harvard’s top-ranked. The two ended up in a draw after two games, but Sedky pulled away in the next two games. The final score (3-1) and the disappointment flipped. But a new feeling creep in for the Penn junior—relief. For three years, Sedky had made the individual national finals. The first two times she lost, but on Sunday she finally won.
If there’s a natural equilibrium in the world, the past three weeks of squash has presented strong evidence in favor of such an idea. The Harvard women won the team title, but then lost out on a season two-peat, although Yong did win her B division final. The Harvard men fell against to Trinity, but then had co-captain Ryan come out on top against Trinity’s top player. There’s been disappointment, but for Coach Mike Way, he has coached national champions on two teams this season. And for David Ryan, a title for a lifetime.

After a week of waiting patiently, the Harvard men’s hockey team finally knows which foe will come to Cambridge this weekend hoping to spoil its chances of reaching Lake Placid for the fourth straight year.
With a 2-1 victory over St. Lawrence in Sunday’s matinee, Dartmouth (15-15-2, 11-10-1 ECAC) advanced to the quarterfinals of the ECAC Championship where it will clash with the Crimson (13-12-4, 11-8-3) in a best-of-three series. The winner earns a spot in the semifinals hosted at Herb Brooks Arena, the site of the 1980 “Miracle On Ice” game between team USA and the Soviet Union.
“[Reaching Lake Placid again] is really hard to do,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We’ve been fortunate to be there the last three years, but I don’t think we take it for granted. It’s such a great venue, and it’s a carrot for us right now. We want to have a chance to defend our ECAC championship, and it starts on Friday against a real good Dartmouth team.”
The Crimson, the four-seed in the conference tournament, returns to action after enjoying a bye this past weekend. Harvard had already clinched a position in the ECAC’s top four—and thus a week off—before it battled Brown and Yale in late February. Nevertheless, a disappointing pair of results against the Ivy League rivals, who were both eliminated from playoff competition in the first round, has made Harvard eager to return to competitive action.
“Every game, you take away the negatives and positives,” said Crimson junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage. “That weekend didn’t go quite as we wanted, but having [the bye] week definitely gives us more time to mentally get back into it. Any playoff series, it’s a whole different beast…. People should be fresh and rebooted for this weekend.”
Zerter-Gossage, who sat out against Yale for precautionary measures, has availed himself of the extra time the bye week has provided and will return to the lineup this weekend. For the winger and others, the off-week is a welcome break.
“Towards the end of the season, you play more games and guys get a little bit worn down,” Harvard tri-captain Eddie Ellis said. “It’s great to use the extra week to get guys healthy, and at the same time…any extra week that we have to get better ourselves and not worry about preparing for an opponent is huge.”
The Big Green enters the series, spanning Friday through Sunday if needed, on a relative high note. Following a loss to the Crimson on Feb. 2, the squad picked up late-season victories against Yale and then-No. 7 Clarkson and has seen a surge in its scoring, averaging roughly half a goal per game in excess of its pre-February average.
Two sophomore forwards, in particular, have led the way for Dartmouth offensively. Will Graber and Shane Sellar, imposing their size at 6’5” and 6’3”, respectively, pace their team in scoring thanks to elevated play since Harvard completed the regular season sweep last month. Graber (32 GP, 9–16—25) has logged 13 points in nine games since that turning point, and Sellar (31 GP, 11–11—22) has registered 12.
“Graber, Sellar, and [freshman Quin] Foreman are three big guys who have been filling the net a little bit for them,” said coach Donato, providing his pre-scout of the weekend’s opposition. “We know those guys pretty well, but we haven’t seen all three of them together. They’ve got good size, they’re hard to contain down low…. It provides a good challenge.”
In spite of the Big Green’s recent offensive uptick, the Crimson has allowed just one goal to Dartmouth this season. Both victories over the Hanover-dwellers (5-0, 4-1) were decisive. In this way, the quarterfinal matchup favors Harvard, who has nabbed the teams’ last three tilts and lost just one out of the last nine (7-1-1), dating back to 2014.
On the flipside, for a team that entered the ECAC Championship with a lackluster 13-14-2 record, the Big Green boasts a more impressive slate of wins than the Crimson. Most notably, Dartmouth took down then-No. 2 Denver in mid-December and returned from the holiday hiatus with a victory over then-No. 16 New Hampshire. The squad followed up these performances by tying then-No. 17 Minnesota-Duluth.
In its conference schedule, the Big Green swept Clarkson—ranked No. 2 and No. 7 at the time of the bouts—as well as Yale, a team that stole both games from the Crimson in the regular season for the first time since 2014-2015. The green and white also skated past Colgate, a squad that Harvard failed to beat this year.
The Crimson, on the other hand, owns a 2-4-2 record against ranked teams and can hang its hat only on victories over then-No. 7 Clarkson and then-No. 19 Boston College in the Beanpot consolation game.
“Last year, we played [Dartmouth] maybe thinking that it would be an easier game than it was,” said Zerter-Gossage, alluding to last January’s 8-4 loss to the Big Green. “Maybe teams like Denver, Duluth, and Clarkson had that same mindset…. They could definitely take wins out of everyone no matter how well their season is going.”
As is often the case in playoff hockey, special teams may be the deciding factor in the series. For Harvard, the ups and downs of its power play have closely tracked its wins and losses. The team has suffered two rough patches this season—one at the outset of its nine-game road stretch in November, and the other from late January through the Beanpot.
Incidentally, both stretches of sub-par outings have begun with Cornell and Colgate, and both have included dry spells on the man advantage. In the earlier skid that bounced the Crimson from the USCHO top-20 rankings, coach Donato’s group went just 1-for-15 (.067) on the power play. In the more recent slide, the team failed to score on 16 attempts.
Of late, Harvard has rebounded from the man-up drought. Since snapping the scoreless streak in mid-February, the Crimson owns the NCAA’s third-best power play conversion rate (.400).
This smoldering man-advantage unit will battle a 23rd-ranked Dartmouth penalty kill (.822 on the year) that has mostly held Harvard’s power play in check this season (.833 against the Crimson).
“The first thing that jumps off the page is that they don’t take a lot of penalties, which usually helps you have a better killing percentage because you can be a little bit more intense and aggressive if you’re taking two as opposed to six,” coach Donato noted. “Those numbers are important, but what’s really important is in one game. You can be 0-for-4, but if you need a goal in the third period and your power play delivers, that’s the game.”
The clash between Harvard’s extra-man group and the Big Green’s penalty kill unit is more or less a toss-up. This is only one aspect of the special teams duel, though. The Crimson will also be tasked with shutting down the Dartmouth power play.
Luckily for this weekend’s home team, denying the Big Green’s man advantage will be easier than solving its kill. Dartmouth has cashed in on just 12.6 percent of its power play opportunities, good for fourth-worst in the nation.
Meanwhile, Harvard has weathered 80.6 percent of the opposition’s extra-man chances and killed off all seven of the Big Green’s power plays during the regular season. It is worth noting, however, that the Crimson has posted a dreadful .741 penalty kill percentage in the last month, good for bottom 10 in college hockey.
“It’s a fresh new slate for everybody,” said coach Donato, suggesting that the playoffs provide a chance for both teams to reinvent their special teams. “You got to do the fundamentals that allow you to have a successful penalty kill: make sure you have good clears, come up with a big save make it tough to enter, win 1-on-1 battles.”
A key component of any team’s penalty kill is the player between the pipes. Looking toward the blue paint, the goaltender showdown will be another defining facet of this weekend’s quarterfinal matchup.
Dartmouth’s masked man, senior Devin Buffalo (14-9-1, 2.69 GAA, .910 SV%), has had an up-and-down season much like the team in front of him. The Alberta native, though, has been crucial for his squad of late—sometimes, it’s Buffalo who steals the show; other times, the net-minder receives enough run support to hang onto victory.
Whatever the reason, Buffalo is responsible for all but one of the Big Green’s wins this year, and he is entering the Harvard series fresh off a sturdy weekend against the Saints (2-1-0, 1.69 GAA, .932 SV%).
For the Crimson, the story in net this season has been a bit more complicated. Tri-captain Merrick Madsen (8-8-3, 2.18 GAA, 9.23 SV%) lost the label of definitive starter after posting a 2-5-1 record through the first two months of the campaign. In the spirit of meritocracy, coach Donato awarded backup Michael Lackey (4-4-1, 2.72 GAA, .899 SV%) three starts in December—the first time Madsen watched games from the bench since his sophomore season.
While both tenders finished the regular season at .500, Madsen’s numbers speak for themselves. The senior ranks 17th nationwide in goals against average and 12th in save percentage.
It may sound puzzling that a sub-.900 goaltender would be stealing starts from Madsen, given his impressive statistics. But consistency has been a major issue not only for Madsen but for the team in general, and coach Donato has used a few goalie changes to rally his group.
The assumption is that the seasoned veteran and captain will get the nod in the playoffs. There truly is no way of guaranteeing a Madsen start, however, especially since it has been a month (3-3-0) since Harvard started the same net-minder in consecutive contests.
“That decision becomes magnified this time of year, but I don’t think the dynamics really change,” coach Donato said. “We want a chance to win every night…. The leash is pretty short. We have a series to start, but after that, you don’t get a game two.”
The bench boss was reluctant to favor one backstop over the other as of early this week.
A postseason start in game one on Friday will be either Lackey’s first or Madsen’s 13th. Regardless, the Crimson will enjoy a collective first when Dartmouth comes to Cambridge.
Harvard has faced the Big Green six times in the ECAC Championship tournament—in four single-elimination games and, more recently, two series. The Crimson icemen, owners of a 6-4 record in these games, will host Dartmouth at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center for the first time in ECAC post-season history.
Which squad will emerge victorious from the quarterfinal showdown? Harvard will look to continue this year’s success against the Big Green and make some noise in the conference tournament. Dartmouth seeks a spot in Lake Placid and a chance to play spoiler for the conference’s elite teams—a skill the group has already displayed throughout the season.
The series will ultimately come down to which versions of the Big Green and the Crimson show up this weekend.

As the most recently renovated House, Winthrop features large suites, a beautiful dining hall, and many new amenities. Its proximity to the river, the MAC, and Harvard Square certainly add to this close-knit House’s allure.

Winthrop is made up of three halls: Standish, Gore, and the entirely-new Beren Hall, though the latter is typically senior housing. Sophomores can expect to live in either hall singles or suites, as there are no hall doubles. You read that right! Most of the suites are n, so sophomores usually share a double, or convert a common room into a “single,” switching rooms halfway through the year.
In terms of party suites, there’s a large 8-person suite in Standish Hall, and Beren has a 9-man as well as several huge quads (some of these have common rooms are as large as the Lion’s Den—a new common space in Beren).
Although Winthrop is historically known for its strong performance in IMs, its community also now prides itself on the fun activities hosted in the renovated House’s shared spaces. According to HoCo co-chair Trevor D. Noon ‘19, Winthrop used to be looked down upon by the other Houses. Now, “we have the best of everything,” he says.

“We’re a River House, we have great singles and great suites, we’re renovated.” Among the shiny new spaces at Winthropians’ disposal are a gym, a grille, a yoga studio, a rooftop terrace, and an arts room complete with a 3D printer. Not sure if most incoming sophomores need one of those but…it’s there!

The Faculty Deans, Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson, definitely help build community, and put a lot of work into event programming. Recently, they’ve helped plan events for the Super Bowl and Black History Month, and they just started a biweekly event called Music and Mingle, which features student musicians. Other can’t-miss Winthrop events are Throptoberfest and Thropstock—fall- and spring-themed events, respectively. HoCo is also planning to go all-out for Housing Day with an extended Stein—the Houses’ weekly hang-out-and-drink event—and cool Winthrop swag.

We met up with Noon in ’Throp’s shiny new dhall so he could tell us all about the virtues of his House:
How did living in swing housing last year affect the Winthrop community?
TN: Swing housing was great. One of the benefits is that the College gives your House much more money, so that your House life doesn’t suffer. You have better study breaks and more events, and even though we were spread out around campus, [these events] made us stay close.
What’s the deal with IMs and Winthrop?
TN: IM culture was built in when I came in as a sophomore, and it’s something that we value a lot. We used to have a reputation of winning at all costs, now it’s more about building the community. We still have a lot of great talents in the House, even beyond IMs. [Ryan N. Donato ‘19], who’s on the [USA men’s] Olympic hockey team, is in Winthrop. And a lot of our IM captains are club captains for the same sport.
Describe Winthrop in one word.
TN: Innovative. Not just in terms of the renovation, but the House in general. We’re trying to do a lot of new things, like having the new arts studio and putting more focus on that. It represents the student population as well because we have people who are on the forefront of different things for art, and we’re trying to highlight that. Ideally looking forward we’ll have an arts gallery with student art being displayed.

A perfect rhyme, music to your ears: “E-L-I-O-T, you just won the lottery!” On Housing Day, the chants of other House residents pale in comparison. With a House that prides itself on beautiful views of the Charles River, and a spirited, welcoming community that hosts some of the most unforgettable upperclassmen events, there is no denying that if placed in Eliot House, you lucked out in the Housing Lottery.

On the whole, sophomores get n-1 suites, which means that there will be one fewer room than the number of residents in the suite. Other than that, there really isn’t a typical layout. Sophomores get assigned to rooms after seniors and juniors choose. However, there are certain rooms reserved for sophomores, the selection of which changes every year. And for those freshmen who have always hated a hallway bathroom, rest assured there is no such thing in Eliot.

Listen, let’s just admit that partying can be a big part of House life—or college life, for that matter. So we got the scoop on where to get your fix in Eliot: the Cockpit in C Entryway, Ground Zero in the basement, and an eight-person suite called the Octagon. But that’s not to say you can’t throw something together at your own place!
One of the best spots for students to chill in the House is the courtyard. Eliot residents bring blankets out there (when it’s warm, of course) and watch their friends perform. A student DJ, who is now studying abroad, used to DJ out in the courtyard! During the cold months, the dining hall or the Grille are great spaces to catch up with friends.
Despite its smaller size, Eliot’s sense of community is like no other. Between the House’s apple-picking sessions in the fall, ballet and concert outings, volleyball games in the courtyard, and strong enthusiasm for IMs (especially crew), Eliot oozes with spirit.

The three formals hosted throughout the year also help tie Eliot residents together: Soirée in the fall, Formal in the winter, and Fête in the spring. Eliot also organizes an annual charity auction where residents sells their belongings to support a specific cause.
There’s also a sophomore outing at the beginning of the year to help incoming students get familiar with their new Housemates. One year, for instance, students took a trip to the zoo and did a scavenger hunt with the tutors in the House.

The Faculty Deans and Tutors are really involved in House life and are super close to the residents. One of the Faculty Deans, Douglas A. Melton, is a professor at Harvard, and for those who study science, a great person to talk to. Eliot Faculty Deans and tutors help plan special events, such as open houses or dinners with famous guests.
We sat down with one of Eliot’s HoCo chairs, Jamie A. Hawkins ’19, to get a little more insight on what the House is like:
If you had to describe your House in three words what would they be?
JH: Spirited, welcoming, and domus—which means home in Latin.
What is the biggest misconception about Eliot?
JH: The biggest misconception is probably that we have so much money. I can’t tell you how many people tell me that, and you know, that’s fine...but as HoCo [co-chair], I’m telling you right now...that we charge House dues. This is how we have what we have. That’s really all it is…Not every House charges House dues, which is why there is some differentiation in the budgets...Our dues are SEF-eligible.
What Hogwarts house would Eliot get sorted into?
JH: Ravenclaw.

This small, close-knit House with a boar mascot is anything but boar-ing. From Secret Santa to the Kirkland Drama Society, K-House is full of homely cheer. And good luck finding a House with this many adorable pups. Read on to find out more about the quirkiest of Houses.

Sophomores, lucking into a spirited House in such a prime location comes with a few sacrifices...you’ll most likely be in n-1 rooms. But not all is lost, rooms get better the older you are. As far as bigger suites go, Kirkland has two 10-mans! One is located in B Entryway and the other in E Entryway. We’re not saying they are party suites or anything...but we have a tendency to believe that a party in a 10-man suite would be 10/10.
When it comes to dining, Kirkland knows what’s up. The House is small enough to share a kitchen with Eliot, so you know the food is good. Kirkland’s dhall is a cozy location to enjoy your meals, a drastic change from Annenberg’s extremely long tables where you could wind up sitting at the same table as your first awkward hookup, your roommate’s ex-boyfriend, and the kid in your section that you lowkey hated. It’s snug and intimate, with small tables just large enough to catch a meal with your closest buds. Plus, you will see no ugly napkin holders on the tables because Kirkland is classy like that.

If housed in Kirkland, get ready for a variety of fun and quirky traditions and events! To name just a few, Kirkland is known for its garden parties, sophomore outing, Kirkland Drama Society, and Stein clubs.
However, one of its most distinct traditions is its annual Secret Santa, which takes place the last week of the fall semester. Students choose how hard they want to go, on a scale of one to six, are matched accordingly, and then spend the week doing nice (and occasionally crazy) things for their Secret Santas that can include anything from hiring a band to serenade them, to renting a pup to play with for a few hours.

The Kirkland community is one of the tightest around, a fact proven by the annual Holiday Dinner where the whole House gets together for a magnificent meal before the Winter Formal. At this dinner, the seniors give speeches on why they love Kirkland. Talk about an undying House bond. Oh, and Incest Fest is a thing.
We enjoyed a cozy conversation with Kirkland HoCo co-chair Anne K. Mills ‘19 to find out what else makes Kirkland so cozy:
On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate Kirkland’s House spirit? Why?
AM: 10! We are the House with the most spirit. For the past 10 years, we’ve been the first House to put our flag on John Harvard on Housing Day!
What do you think of Kirkland’s location on River West? Pros? Cons?
AM: Kirkland has an amazing location which brings me to a pro and con that are the same: Kirkland’s proximity to El Jefe’s.
If Kirkland was a fruit, what fruit would it be and why?
AM: Kirkland would be grapes because there are so many different pockets of things to love about it!
