After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the years before the recession, Harvard’s plans for Allston were so bold that they seem almost fanciful today. There was talk of a tram across campus, moving the graduate schools of education and public health across the river, and even the possibility of building a new bridge. The University hired the prominent architect Frank Gehry, and building designs were drawn up. There was a sense of immediacy to the Allston plans. Those plans may still come to fruition, but it will take much longer than the planners originally hoped. Still, there is one piece of the old plans that should not wait or be canceled. Harvard should build three new Houses across the river and repurpose the Quad.
Even under the revised, post-recession plans, Allston will become a lot more important for undergraduates when the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences joins the Business School, the i-Lab, and athletic facilities on the other side of the Charles. Harvard’s most recent plans aim to make the Allston campus and the Cambridge campus feel like a continuous whole. Without a vibrant undergraduate presence, however, there is a risk that Allston will feel lifeless and manufactured.
Harvard College is the symbolic center of the University. Whether it is the freshman dorms in Harvard Yard or the red and gold dome of Dunster, the most recognizable parts of Harvard College are the most recognizable parts of Harvard as a whole. Of course, the distinction is more than architectural—the undergraduate population has certainly helped to make Harvard Square the vibrant place that it is. If the goal of building in Allston is to create one Harvard, then there is no better way than to build new Houses.
If Harvard chooses not to build undergraduate housing in Allston, the undergraduate campus will fragment. Instead of two disconnected campuses, we will have three: the main campus in Cambridge, where most students live and go to class; the Quad campus, isolated from the Square; and the new Allston campus, a collection of shiny but soulless buildings that students leave as soon as classes are done. The span of the undergraduate campus will double, and even a functioning shuttle service would not be able to reduce the feeling of distance between the Quad and Allston.
The danger here is not so much the distance between the Quad, the Yard, and Allston as it is the psychological separation between the Quad, the Yard, and Allston. The distance from Dunster to the Science Center is the same as the distance from the Yard to the Quad, but Dunster students are not cut off from the bustling activity in Harvard Square. The Quad, on the other hand, feels somehow apart from the rest of campus. Closing the Quad and building new Houses across the River does not solve the problem of physical distance, but it could resolve the feeling of isolation. It is not possible to bring the feeling of the Square, the Yard, and the river to the Quad, but it is very possible to bring that feeling to Allston.
Building new Houses by itself is no panacea. A vibrant undergraduate presence in Allston is necessary to truly unify the Allston and Cambridge campuses, but moving students across the river is not enough on its own. As University Professor Peter L. Galison wrote in a Crimson op-ed six years ago, as Harvard contemplated moving three Houses across the River, “Allston must be thought of as a fundamental piece of the dynamic center of Harvard University. Here’s the acid test: It is 6:30 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. on a Thursday or Friday or Saturday—and if you don’t think it would be great to go to Allston, if ‘back to the Square’ is on the tip of your tongue and you would never think of going ‘back to Allston,’ then we will have failed.” Allston will need its late night food spots and quirky shops.
This plan may have to wait a while. This is not 2007, when the University’s financial position was much less precarious, and it seemed like a bold vision could be implemented quickly. It will not happen within ten years if the University sticks to the current master plan, but perhaps within twenty. Even so, Harvard will soon be a very different place. Some people say that universities change slowly, but the next ten years in Cambridge and Allston will prove those people wrong. By 2023, if all goes according to plan, most of the Houses will have undergone renewal, there will be a campus center, and the present capital campaign will be well in the past. Planning for the next capital campaign should be well underway. And of course, Harvard will have a much greater presence in Allston.
The other side of the Charles is key to the future of Harvard. It is time to double down on Allston, dust off the old plans, and create new Houses across the river.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Surging sea levels and drowning cities. Hurricanes and heat waves. Drought and destruction. As activists have warned us with ever-increasing urgency, we face this stark reality within a century if we fail to address the looming issue of climate change. In the worst-case scenario, life on Earth as we know it will be destroyed. All this may be true, and the scientific consensus is that it is in fact true. So we have a real problem.
But divestment is not a real answer.
In an unprecedented move, University President Drew G. Faust explicitly rejected divestment from fossil fuels in a recent public statement. However, she missed the fundamental issue at hand. Her concerns about the politicization of the endowment, shareholder influence, and investment returns are valid (though hotly contested). But as Faust acknowledges, climate change is a central issue of our time. Ultimately, we need a sustainable society with significantly lower carbon emissions. If Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuel companies brought us meaningfully closer to achieving that goal, then it would be worth seriously considering. The problem with divestment is that it does not.
Now, I freely admit that I was among the 72 percent of students who voted in favor of divestment last year on the UC referendum. In retrospect, though, I chose “Yes” pretty much just because the initiative vaguely seemed like something I’d support. I mean, who doesn’t want “to avert further environmental and human rights crises due to climate change?” The more I thought about it though, the more skeptical I became that divestment would actually advance this lofty stated goal. After all, it fails to address the core issue that drives carbon emission: consumer demand.
The divestment movement wants Harvard to sell its shares in companies such as Exxon Mobil. But this does nothing to reduce our impact on the environment. Even if we divested completely—even if we managed to make fossil fuel stocks seem socially distasteful—we would not reduce the amount of emissions in the world nor would we reduce the profits of Exxon or any other fossil fuel-using entity (except Harvard, as Faust argues).
This is because emissions are fundamentally a consequence of our reliance on carbon-based fuels. We use them to heat our homes, run our cars, generate our electricity, and much more, and that consumption won’t change simply because the perception of fossil fuel stocks might change. At most, divestment may slightly reduce demand for Exxon’s stocks, but it does not reduce demand for Exxon’s actual products. And just as people who use oil don’t actively intend to pollute, Exxon doesn’t supply oil because it is an evil institution out to destroy the world—it does so because we all demand it. The real issue is not the fact that Exxon exists, as the divestment movement seems to imply, but rather that we all rely on fossil fuels to power our daily lives.
In essence, divestment is merely a symbolic statement, albeit one that costs Harvard money to make. More damningly, though, divestment lulls us into the false and dangerous impression that we have made a difference, that we have done our part to stop climate change by supporting the campaign. In reality, it only appeases fickle consciences while distracting us from the necessary but more demanding task at hand.
Certainly, sometimes it is valuable to take a symbolic stand even at a cost, especially on issues of fundamental morality like opposition to genocide or racial discrimination. However, while blaming fossil fuel companies for climate change is a convenient narrative, in reality this is not a black-and-white issue by any means. After all, if we divest from Exxon, why don’t we divest from all companies, since all companies use fuel? Why don’t we stop using vehicles, electricity, and heating oil, since in doing so we pollute? Such a view is obviously infeasible and reductionist. History has given us a society that runs on fossil fuels, a problem for which we are now collectively responsible.
Realistically, the only way to combat climate change is to comprehensively reduce carbon emissions, and the only way to do that is to fundamentally transform the society we live in, so that people no longer need or demand fossil fuels. The clearest routes I see to this end are sustained innovations in technology or policy that can steadily produce cleaner energy and widespread changes in social norms—innovations Harvard’s money and research are helping to achieve. This is where we should focus our attention.
Admittedly, Exxon may not be eager to see a shift away from fossil fuels. However, entrepreneurship and research move forward despite the status quo—even Exxon itself is investing hundreds of millions into alternative energy development, a recognition that the future of fossil fuels is limited. In the end, the biggest obstacle is not Exxon but the deep-seated societal dependence on fossil fuels and the subsequent reluctance to make the difficult transition away from them. But as fossil fuels become increasingly scarce, and thus expensive, and as environmental concerns become increasingly important (through the efforts of activists and growing general awareness), the impetus, both for political and technological change, will only grow stronger.
Ultimately, the same human ingenuity and drive that gave us a modern society that runs on fossil fuels can give us one that runs without. Divestment cannot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston’s next mayor will inherit a school system in which over one in four students will not graduate high school. That rate is significantly higher among African-Americans and among Hispanic students, and among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The city’s next mayor needs to address the opportunity gap present in Boston, and the candidate with the best preparation to do so is City Councilor John R. Connolly.
As a City Councilor, John Connolly has championed education reform aimed at reducing the dropout rate and introducing greater equity into the city’s school system. Connolly was the only City Councilor to vote against a teacher contract the failed to extend Boston’s school day, one of the shortest urban school days in the country. As mayor, he hopes to keep students in school longer—and to fill the extra time with arts, music, sports, and extra support.
Connolly also deserves accolades for his support of broad reform to the structure of education. He was a vocal supporter of Massachusetts’ 2010 legislation to turn around struggling schools by increasing state financial support while providing greater flexibility in hiring, scheduling, and curriculum. Under current staffing regulations, the 2012 Massachusetts Teacher of the Year—who was teaching in a traditional, in-district Boston Public School—was laid off solely because of his lack of seniority. Any policy that results in the lay-off of a Massachusetts Teacher of the Year should be amended, and Connolly’s vocal support of turnaround schools and education reform suggest that he is the candidate to do bring about that change.
Structural reform should be coupled with greater support—financial and otherwise—for public education, and Connolly understands this. He specifically advocates for shifting more resources away from central bureaucracy and into individual schools, and he wants to strengthen the city’s teacher training and evaluation systems. When the city was faced with budget cuts, Connolly fought to protect the school system from crippling lay offs, understanding the paramount importance of education both to the economy and to our democratic society.
In many ways, both Walsh and Connolly support education reform, but Connolly’s record shows a greater tendency to take substantive action on the issue even when it is politically unpopular to do so. His vote against maintaining Boston’s exceptionally short school day, for example, drew sharp criticism especially from the Boston Teachers’ Union. Meanwhile, Walsh’s campaign is largely being funded by outside political action committees. The City can expect John Connolly to more effectively tackle difficult political issues on its behalf, regardless of the political cost of doing so.
The celebrated American philosopher John Dewey said that “only through education can equality of opportunity be anything more than a phrase.” Both Connolly and Walsh seem to understand this. But Dewey also said that “constructive work [needs] to be done by the state . . . before all can have, otherwise than in name, an equal chance.” If Boston wants to improve on its educational achievements and truly nullify the inequities in opportunity that plague our education system, the city will have to do substantive work to address those inequalities. That work will be difficult, and may sometimes have to challenge dogmatically held beliefs. John Connolly’s record provides the City’s best hope to bring about this vision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I said the term “hooking up” to an older friend, he thought I was talking about fishing. I told him it was basically the same thing, but you don’t pull a fish into shore via a hook on the mouth. Rather, you hook two together by the mouth and let them flap about for a bit.
Understandably, for those who hear about hookup culture for the first time, it warrants strange reactions. My friend’s response—silence for 35 awkward seconds—was fairly mild. In the media, there are usually two, fiercer types. One says (I’m paraphrasing), “Stop! Stop! Why are you fucking—I mean fudging—well I guess I mean fucking—around like that?!?” The other says, “It allows both sexes to experiment and have fun on an equal playing field.”
But what most writing on the subject overlooks is that hookup culture affects people on a more individual level than most issues on college campuses, which makes it hard to evaluate on any large scale. The truth is, hooking up is good or bad depending on who you are and where you’ve been (that’s as literal as you want it to be).
As a Crimson columnist, I’m the voice of our generation, describing my observations and arguing points in elegant prose that give rise to great social change. I’m also good at table tennis. But instead of making generalizations this time, I just want to point out a few things. Describe what I’ve heard. Then you can put it together if you want and respond individually. It’ll be odd. But try not to read too much into it. This column is just experimenting.
Billie-Jean: “Thanks for that last night.”
 The term “hookup culture” started popping up around the year 2000. But people at Harvard and elsewhere have been hooking up for much longer than that. Members of the class of 1981 and 1987 told me that people back then hooked up at parties but dated as well. So what’s changed to create a full-on “hookup culture?”
A study, yet to be published, from the University of Portland found that undergraduates from 2002-2010 (the “hookup era”) have actually been having less sex with fewer partners than students from 1988-1996. The key difference is actually that the hookup era students have sex with friends, pickups, and casual partners more frequently and choose to have longer term sexual partnerships (with more frequent sex) less frequently. So hookup culture is defined not by how much sex we are having, but who we are having it with, despite conservative outcries.
Jesse: “Np.”
According to APA research, humans are hitting puberty earlier and marrying later. Thus one explanation for the rise in hookup culture is students’ earlier biological readiness for sex but later psychological readiness for settling down. However, these are broad changes. And this cultural shift is more sudden. Thus, while some today are prepared to hookup, some must be left behind.
Billie-Jean: “Quick quiz: what’s my name?”
The American Psychological Association found that people, after hooking up, are generally glad they did it. And many female students say that it is freeing not to have to think about significant others, which can feel like the time commitment of another course. And some even argue that hookup culture empowers women. There is one major downside for both genders though: sex with a hookup is just worse. A large online survey found that the orgasm rate in hookups is 44% for men and 19% for women. In relationships, that rate is 85% for men and 68% for women.
 Jesse: “Bj?”
There are reasons against thinking that hookup culture empowers women. Men initiate hookups more often and are typically less interested in a romantic relationship. Also, among women who experience unwanted sex in college, 70 percent do so in the context of a hookup. Finally, one study found that only 4.4 percent of men and 8.2 percent of women in hookups expected a traditional romantic relationship as an outcome, while 29 percent of men and 42.9 percent of women wanted such an outcome. Thus, the desires of men are more often satisfied than of those of women, casting doubt on whether such a system is empowering to women at all.
And hookup culture is exclusive.  According to a survey of relevant academic literature popularized by a July write-up in Slate, only 14 percent of students hookup more than 10 times in college. These students are more likely to be white, well-off, able-bodied, straight, and attractive. One example is that African-American students are less likely to participate in hookup culture because of stereotypes of African-Americans as more sexual than other races. Sociological studies claim that black students feel a need to fight that perception by not hooking up. So if hookup culture has become a healthy norm to some, it is an impossible or hurtful norm to others.
Billie-Jean: “…gotta change my initials.”
 As pervasive as hookup culture is, it’s not mandatory. Four out of ten students are still virgins coming out of college and three out of ten have never hooked up. While relationships can be harder to find, they are still around—for both genders and all sexualities. And those that do engage in hooking up don’t stay that way and certainly don’t plan to.
Jesse:“?”
 So is hookup culture fun exploration or bodily exploitation?
Billie-Jean: “lol.”

According to journalists Hendrik Hertzberg ’65 and Ta-Nehisi Coates, the field of journalism has become harder to enter but less lucrative in the United States today.
Coates, a senior editor at “The Atlantic,” and Hertzberg, a senior editor at “The New Yorker” and former Crimson managing editor, discussed the shifting state of journalism in the United States at a lecture in MIT’s Stata Center Tuesday evening.
The discussion was directed by Coates, who asked Hertzberg questions about his experiences as an opinion columnist and about the evolution of journalism over time.
“We are at a Gutenberg moment. Everything has been thrown up in the air, and we don’t know how or whether it is going to settle,” Hertzberg said, referring to the Gutenberg printing press that revolutionized information exchange in early modern Europe. “The internet allows anyone to transmit their opinions and ideas to the public, creating a wave of opinions and ideas that may be difficult to sift through.”
Responding to the assertion that the public is losing the ability to recognize good journalism because of this trend, Hertzberg stressed the importance of not glorifying the past.
“Though there are more opinions out there, I doubt that the proportion of good to bad ideas has changed,” he added. “Journalism in the past has been pretty dreadful.”
Coates added that journalists starting their careers today “need more conviction and must always have the intellectual courage to answer the questions that arise from their ideas in order to entice readers who have other things to do than read essays.”
Hertzberg said that he might not be as motivated to get into journalism if he were starting today.
“For me, it was the path of least resistance,” he said.
Thomas M. Levenson ’80, a professor of scientific writing at MIT who moderated the discussion, noted “a potential correlation between the dreadful state of US political culture and pathologies in opinion journalism culture.”
However, Hertzberg disagreed, calling the degree to which journalism degrades political culture “routinely exaggerated.”
Both Coates and Hertzberg agreed that the elements that drew them to opinion writing still remain in journalism today.
Coates said that what he loves about writing is “making the reader feel the argument, not just read it.”
Hertzberg said that for him, it is the effort to make writing aesthetically pleasing in its structure, sentence by sentence, that makes writing worthwhile.
“Putting sentences together has a graphic aspect, and graphically beautiful writing can open your ideas to people who do not agree with you,” he said.
Coates also described the growing opportunities afforded to writers in a changing media landscape.
“Blogging is a kind of recreation that allows me to come up with things that I cannot come up with in formal writing,” Coates said.

Despite President Barack Obama and Congress tasking the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission with a critical role in the restructuring of the economy three years ago, the agency has retained nearly the same number of employees for two decades, CFTC chair Gary Gensler told an audience at the Institute of Politics Tuesday evening. 
As the keynote speaker at the 2013 Annual Glauber Lecture on Financial Regulation, Gensler told the audience at the Institute of Politics of an urgent need for growth at an understaffed agency.
“To actually have markets be well-functioning, you need well-resourced agencies overseeing them,” Gensler said. “That’s not where the CFTC is right now. We’re at 675 people right now, which is about the size we were 20 years ago…and yet, we now oversee this 400 trillion dollar market which is 10 times the size of the futures market place that we used to oversee.”
Gensler said that before Obama and Congress increased the responsibility of the CFTC—which regulates investment in commodities among other tasks—the agency could be viewed as something “you probably would never have heard of unless you grew up on a farm somewhere.”
Gensler admitted that the CFTC was initially unprepared for the newly-imposed tasks in 2010, but he said that he has seen significant improvement even though the economy has not fully recovered.
“Five years ago the US economy was in free-fall,” Gensler said. “It cost middle class Americans and hardworking people around the globe their jobs, their pensions, their homes.”
Gensler said that in the midst of the deepening recession much of the country’s economic future hinged on the success of an understaffed organization.
“We were an agency that did maybe three to five rules a year, and we were being asked to do 60 [rules] and Congress gave us one year,” he said. “It was a daunting task, and three years along we’ve largely completed the task.”
Gensler invoked baseball to warn the audience about a future without an expansion in the size of the CFTC staff.
  “Now you might not have liked the umpire’s call in the Red Sox game the other night,” Gensler said. “But can you imagine if Major League Baseball expanded tenfold and you didn’t expand the number of umpires?... It wouldn’t work too well. The fans after a while would lose confidence in the game. And I think that’s really what’s going to happen [with the CFTC].”
Robert Glauber ’61, a Kennedy School lecturer who introduced Gensler at the beginning of the event, said he was excited to feature Gensler as the speaker at his name-sake forum. 
“We are certainly most fortunate to have [Gensler] as this year’s speaker. He’s been at the center of some of the most important and controversial rulemaking going on with the financial crisis,” Glauber said.

Current academic assessments fail to teach students skills that are applicable in the real world, argued Area Dean for Applied Physics Eric Mazur during a lecture to a packed hall in the Science Center Tuesday afternoon.
 
During his lecture, which was titled “The Silent Killer of Learning” and was selected as this year’s Dudley Herschbach Scientist/Teacher lecture, Mazur also argued that assessments promote “inauthentic problem solving,” and thus fail to provide students with the skills most needed in the real world. Mazur said that assessments should focus on feedback, not ranking, and on skills, not memorization.
 
With a picture of an exam room displayed on the board, Mazur asked, “Have you ever in your professional life encountered a situation where you were cut off from any source of information and from other people?” The remark drew chuckles from the crowd.
 
In an effort to make the skills learned in the classroom more applicable in the real world, Mazur said that he allows students to bring their books and notes into assessments and has group examinations, where students work in a team, teaching and learning from each other. Mazur also advocated for immediate peer assessments, which he said allow students to receive feedback while the information is still fresh in their mind.
 
Typical assessments ask you to discover a solution using a learned procedure, which Mazur said is troublesome because real-world problems require students to discover a procedure to reach a desired outcome.
 
Furthermore, Mazur argued that current assessments problematically rob students of the freedom to make mistakes.
 
“Making mistakes is a part of problem solving,” said Mazur, but “grading is incompatible with real problem-solving because it penalizes students for making mistakes …. It makes students risk averse.”
 
Mazur also noted that current tests, in an attempt to make objective questions, have stripped away questions that require students to make or form their own assumptions. Mazur gave the example of determining when a space in a full parking lot would open up as an instance in which an individual would need to assume how long individuals park.
 
However, Mazur said, “the ability to make correct assumptions is one of the most useful skills no matter the job our students are going to take.”
 
Audience members said that they found the lecture educational.
“People should start trying [these collaborative approaches] more in other classes,” said Madhavi V.S.V. Duvvuri ’14, who took Mazur’s Applied Physics 50 class last year and is currently one of his teaching fellows.
 
“Learning to communicate science to other people is an invaluable skill—you don’t see a lot of people being trained to do that in other classes,” he said.
 
Leigh A. Needleman, a Harvard lab manager, said that after listening to Mazur she was interested in including more student-driven grading in the lab she teaches.
 
Katy A. Muth, a local high school teacher, said that the lessons applied to her as well. She planned on encouraging students to work through AP Calculus problems collaboratively, rather than simply handing them separate questions.

Six alumni of the Crimson Summer Academy—a University program that draws local high-achieving, economically disadvantaged students to study at Harvard for six weeks each summer—reflected on memorable experiences with the program to commemorate its 10-year anniversary in a forum at the Longfellow Center Tuesday.
 
The program, spearheaded by A. Clayton Spencer, former vice president for policy at Harvard and current president at Bates College, provides students from families with incomes averaging $29,000 a year in Boston and Cambridge with the opportunity to channel their academic ambitions and achieve their goals of attending four-year universities.
 
“It’s all about aligning the students’ ambition with opportunities,” said Spencer, who is called by many the “godmother” of the Crimson Summer Academy. “I think it’s transformed their lives.” 
Among others, Harvard Graduate School of Education students, University President Drew G. Faust, and teachers and administrators from Boston public schools attended the forum.
 
“What brought me to this program was an interest in making college and career readiness programs accessible,” said Ceri F. Evans, a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. “So to see a presentation like this, from an organization who’s living the mission that I want to have, is just really inspiring.”
In order to attend the academy, which spans three consecutive summers starting the students’ freshman year, the students’ families must income must not exceed $65,000 dollars annually. Each student must complete an application and an interview with one of the directors of the program.
 
Panelist Ellery Kirkconnell, a 2009 CSA graduate, described himself as “hungry” when asked why he thought he had been accepted into the program.
 
“We wanted to step outside the door. We wanted to achieve. We wanted to get out, ” he said.
 
Maxine Rodburg, director of the Crimson Summer Academy and a former Expository Writing preceptor at Harvard, said her greatest reward in designing and directing the program has been following her students beyond their graduation from CSA.
 
“It’s quite remarkable,” Rodburg said. “We’ve really built a community here.”
 
Rodburg said the community is composed of CSA mentors, who are either Harvard undergraduates or CSA alumni, and teachers, most of whom have direct ties to Harvard.
 
Jefferson Correia, a graduate of the first CSA class in 2007 and a 2011 Syracuse University graduate, said this community enabled him to learn among other similarly-ambitious students and form long-lasting friendships.
 
“I always had a desire to learn, and I don’t know how you can instill that in anybody,” Correia said. “So many people just don’t have confidence in themselves, and a lot that is because other people have told them they can’t do it.”
 
Eda Kaceli ’16, a 2012 CSA graduate, said the program gave her the confidence to apply to top-tier schools, something her high school had not provided her.
 
Studies on students in the 10 percent of college aptitude test takers by Harvard Kennedy School researcher Christopher N. Avery ’88 have shown that many capable students from low-income families do not apply to top-tier schools because they simply are not aware of the options available to them.
 
“Education is ideally the antecedent of income and social mobility,” Avery, who has worked with CSA in tracking students’ progress during the program and into their college years, said. “It’s almost a universal phenomenon that students who attend the program have found success in later years.”

After a weekend of Halloween festivities and with more trick-or-treating on the horizon, students gathered on Tuesday night not to discuss their party plans, but rather what they described as a problematic narrative behind insensitive Halloween costumes.
 
The discussion, spearheaded by the Harvard College Sustained Dialogue group and led by professor Caroline Light, director of undergraduate studies in Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, was meant to provide students with a platform to express their views on how the appropriation of cultures implies oppressive undertones.
 
“We’ve always wanted to do a dialogue on Halloween costumes and how they perpetuate stereotypes,” said Judy Park ’14, co-director of Harvard College Sustained Dialogue.
 
Sustained dialogue is part of a larger national and international campus network where university students participate in a model of dialogue, attempting to bridge issues of diversity and difference through personal experience with the goal of galvanizing change on campus, according to Humza S. Bokhari ’14, the other co-director of the group.
 
At the discussion, students expressed concerns over racially and culturally insensitive costumes, such as “Blackface,” Trayvon Martin, and terrorist costumes for young children–all of which they argue put minorities on the periphery and whiteness as the norm in society.
 
“It is difficult for people to think critically about these costumes because of our desire for color blindness,” said Light. She then went on to describe the consumer culture that allows ‘blackness’ and ‘ghetto culture’ to have market value.
 
The event also incorporated dialogue on the fetishization and sexualization of women from marginalized groups, such as geisha or ‘Pocahottie’ costumes.
 
“It denies history and portrays racially minority women as perpetually wanting sex, as the willing objects of white conquest,” said Light. She argued that the appropriation of a Native American stereotype is especially problematic because of the history of oppression and appropriation by white colonists.
 
However, students discussed the merits of donning a different identity, so long as it is done respectfully.
 
“I believe you should be able to dress up as someone, even someone of a different race, if you admire them,” said Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, recruitment and publicity chair for HCSD. “You can dress up like Beyoncé, but you don’t have to paint your skin black to do so.”
 
The event is part of “De-Stereotype Me Week,” organized by the group as a means of addressing different issues that exist at Harvard but are not necessarily vocalized.
 
“We borrowed the idea from someone in the Sustained Dialogue network,” said Park, “and the idea was that people would wear t-shirts or buttons that expressed one way they defy the stereotype. For example, ‘I am a legacy and I am on financial aid.’” Students are encouraged to wear their pins or buttons this coming Friday.
  “We’re hoping that through our discussions of personal experiences we can actually build real understanding and empathy as opposed to staying in the real academic or political debates that we see a lot [on campus],” said Park.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Despite several Harvard initiatives to recruit high-achieving, low-income students, the College’s early action program tends to advantage applicants from higher income brackets in the short run, a trend that is expected to “continue to be the case for the foreseeable future,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson in an interview Tuesday.
 
Harvard continues to combat this with efforts like the recent launch of the Harvard College Connection, but Fitzsimmons explained that a lack resources at the high schools of many low-income students still remains an issue.
 
“What tends to happen with people of modest economic backgrounds is they tend to disproportionately attend schools where there are fewer counselors per student. Many also attend schools where there are fewer teachers per student,” he said.
 
Fitzsimmons added that these applicants are often first-generation college students.
 
Historically, early pools have contained fewer students from modest economic backgrounds when compared to the regular admission applicant pool, according to Fitzsimmons.
 
This disparity in representation did not come as a surprise to Bari Norman, president of Expert Admissions.
 
“Just as we know, [high-income] students have access to greater resources. As a result, they have a better handle on the process, and they’ll be more prepared, even if just by meeting the basic requirements to complete an application and submit it earlier,” Norman said.
 
Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at California college counseling firm IvySelect, also noted an information gap between these groups of students.
 
“[Among high-income students], there is almost a universal awareness of an early process,” he said. “It’s clear that there’s an information gap.”
 
The issue has been a common thread in the last five years. In 2007, when Harvard decided to eliminate the early action program, then-President Derek C. Bok argued that these programs “advantage the advantaged.”
 
Data collected from this year’s Class of 2017 survey also appeared to justify this concern with respondents from the two highest income categories being more likely to say they had been admitted early. The survey suggested that respondents from the two lowest income categories were underrepresented.
 
However, Harvard reinstated its early action program to meet the expectation of top students for whom applying early is “the new normal,” Fitzsimmons said Tuesday.
 
Fitzsimmons argued that further delay of bringing back the early program would have caused the College to miss out on students of all different economic backgrounds who would have applied early elsewhere.
 
Fitzsimmons said he did not predict that in the near future Harvard’s early applicant pools would be any more representative of economic diversity than in recent years. Still, he said that the College plans to develop more strategies and techniques to counteract the discrepancy.
 
“We’re going to run hard against the tide here,” Fitzsimmons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 30, 2013, at 9:30 p.m.
Winthrop House will be renovated in 2016-2017, a timeline that will make it the second full upperclassman House to undergo construction as part of Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project.
Winthrop’s planned renovation, announced in an email from the Winthrop House masters to the House community Wednesday evening, will follow a one-year break in House renewal construction following the renovation of Dunster House in 2014-2015, meaning that the 2015-2016 academic year will represent the first extended pause in the project. Winthrop will be the fourth House to be renovated at least in part under the project, which is intended to eventually restore and modernize all 12 upperclassman Houses.
According to Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal, Winthrop residents displaced by the construction will live in the same swing space housing planned to be used for Dunster—the building that previously housed the Inn at Harvard and Harvard Square apartment buildings Ridgley Hall, Fairfax Hall, and Hampden Hall.
In 2015-2016, as administrators prepare for Winthrop’s renewal, they will assess House renewal’s first three renovation projects—Quincy’s newly renovated and renamed Stone Hall, which opened for students this fall; Leverett’s McKinlock Hall, which is currently undergoing construction; and Dunster House, which will be the first full House to be renewed under the project.
“We have believed from the beginning that we would need to step back after the completion of the first full House to very strategically and deeply assess the first three projects and to ensure those lessons are applied to the future,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in a statement to the Harvard Gazette, the University’s official news publication.
Smith also said that one lesson administrators have learned from the process so far is that “preparation for the renewal of a full House is better done over four years, not three.”
After months of planning, administrators announced in July 2012 that they would begin renewing Dunster two years later. Wednesday’s announcement about Winthrop’s renovation plans comes more than two and a half years before that construction is planned to begin.
Winthrop House co-master Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. expressed excitement about the upcoming renovation in an interview Wednesday night.
“[Co-master Stephanie Robinson] and I are looking forward to working with University officials, as well as the architects and designers, on the design of the House, and we think it's going to be a huge benefit to generations of Winthrop students,” Sullivan said. “We are very much looking forward to starting the process.”
Harvard’s House renewal project is being funded in part by The Harvard Campaign, with $400 million of the project’s more than $1 billion cost coming from the just-launched FAS campaign. The rest of the project will be funded by a combination of endowment funds, debt financing, reserves, and other cash.

The era of Southern plantations and slave masters may seem removed from Harvard’s history, but the University features prominently in new research investigating slavery and its connection to America’s oldest colleges.

MIT professor Craig S. Wilder's “Ebony and Ivy: Race, Slavery, and the Troubled History of America’s Universities,” published last month, added to the conversation about Harvard’s role in slavery.
 On our campus, history professor Sven Beckert has been conducting research in this area since 2007. We spoke with Beckert about his research and its reception from within the University.
 “It's our historical responsibility to come to terms with the history of this community,” Beckert said. “The University was part of a larger system in which slavery was very central. It was part of it, it was complicit in it, and it profited from it.”
 He started with an undergraduate student seminar, in which students conducted research in Widener Library and the University Archives. They quickly found enormous evidence of connections between the University and the slave trade.
 According to their findings, when slavery was still legal in Massachusetts before the Revolutionary War, slaves were a steady presence on campus. They served University presidents, faculty, and students.
Then, in the first half of the 19th century, donations from plantation owners to the University allowed it to expand and donated the estate in Jamaica Plain that eventually became the Arnold Arboretum. At the same time, despite being located in a state that was an abolitionist stronghold, the University stifled public debate about the subject prior to the Civil War.
 A booklet summarizing the research, “Harvard and Slavery: Seeking a Forgotten History” was published in 2011, around the time of Harvard’s 375th anniversary.
 “Our findings were never part of the story that was commemorated then,” Beckert said. “The University needs to recognize that slavery is as much a part of its history as many of its great accomplishments, and make the project not just a project of a small number of professors and students, but one for the University as a whole.”
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Nov. 7, 2013
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the type of research seminar in which history professor Sven Beckert began conducting research on Harvard’s role in slavery. In fact, the seminar was an undergraduate research seminar, not a graduate research seminar.

 There are few things better than a boy band. And so, when another one bites the dust, disaster strikes. If you haven’t already heard (although we can’t imagine how you could be so in the dark), the Jonas Brothers have officially called it quits.
If your first instinct is "Wait, they’re brothers, how could they have broken up?," we don’t really have an answer. We can only provide you with Nick Jonas’ disheartening explanation, “I was feeling kind of trapped." Though Nick apparently said that "It’s really hard to say ‘forever,’" he also confirmed that he and his brothers are "closing a chapter, for sure.”
  And so, we shed a tear. Not just for the Jonas Brothers—but for all those beloved boy bands (New Kids on the Block, ‘N SYNC, Backstreet Boys etc., etc.) that have broken up. 
  Don’t cry too hard, though. It’s easy to transfer all that time and energy you spent thinking about/listening to/watching/obsessing over the JoBros to a new group of young, talented hotties.
  Here are Flyby's recommendations for some groups to start with:
 
1. One Direction2. The Wanted*3. 5 Seconds of Summer4. Big Time Rush5. Justin Bieber**
It will all be okay, we promise!
* And yes, you must choose between One Direction and The Wanted.** Yes, we know he’s not a boy band but come on—it’s Justin Bieber.

Whether you're a Con Law student prepping for your next paper or a 1L cramming for Civil Procedure, be careful while you research—your materials might very well be rotting away.
According to a recent study by Harvard Law School professor Jonathan L. Zittrain '95 and J.D. candidate at the Law School Kendra K. Albert, many of the online citations in prominent legal publications do not lead to the intended information, while some no longer lead to any content whatsoever.
The study found that 50 percent of all the URL citations in available Supreme Court opinions and more than 70 percent of links in the Harvard Law Review, the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, and the Harvard Law School Human Rights Journal have "rotted," meaning that they no longer link to the originally cited information.
President of the Harvard Law Review Gillian S. Grossman '10, a third-year student at the Law School, declined to comment on the errant links and what Zittrain and Albert called in their paper "a serious problem for scholarship."
Yet if Grossman's organization and other frequently read legal sources don't update their citations, future Harvard students huddled away in Langdell or Lamont might be in even bigger trouble than they are now.
If the internet is left to its own devices, Zittrain and Albert write, "it is likely that readers a few years from now will be unable to obtain huge swaths of sources invoked by what they read, and scholarship would suffer accordingly."
For now, the best solution we can offer, short of actually fixing the pathways of the cited links, is to do your research quickly before more of them disappear into the void of the internet!

UPDATED: Oct. 30, 2013, at 10:53 p.m.
So as you might have heard from your roommates, your professors, or even a random tourist that put his hand on John Harvard’s foot, the Red Sox are 3-2 in the World Series. If you didn’t know that, you have been studying in Lamont for far too long. But don’t worry, Flyby has some basic tips so you don’t look like a total fool when friends invite you to watch tonight's game.
1) Don’t scream home run every time the baseball get hit by the bat. It’s like screaming “GOOAAAL” every time you see a soccer ball being kicked.
2) You know how in basketball, the team get points for just putting a ball in the hoop? WIth baseball, it’s not that simple. The team doesn’t get a point for just hitting the baseball. First of all, they don’t score points, they score runs. To get a run, a player bats at home plate and must go to first base, second base, third base, and back home. Getting home is even harder than it is for Quadlings: in baseball, there is no shuttle.
3) The most exciting game are the ones when no hits anything. This is called a “no-hitter”. Don’t believe us? You’re right, we’re joking.  Of course this is boring. But in actuality, it may take hours for someone to even hit the ball let alone run around the baseball field (also called a diamond for those who missed middle school geometry). They might not even make it all the way. But it represents great skill on the part of a team’s pitcher and its defense.
4) Because it can take a long time for a ball to be hit, you might want to bring some refreshments. Baseball games don’t have the same time limits like football or basketball. So stock up on some Honey Nut Scooters, graciously provided by HUDS, and enjoy the game.
5) You go to Harvard, you root for the Red Sox. This is true even for you New Yorkers and especially for those from St. Louis.
With these tips, you should seem at least competent in baseball knowledge. For all the other things we didn’t mention, BS it like you did your last midterm.
APOCALYPSE NOW. The Common App crashed.  That’s right, folks: The application website for more than 500 colleges has been a mess.  (And kept a detailed public record of the wreckage!)  A few weeks ago, everyone was panicking, and the next week some colleges delayed their application deadlines (woohoo!).  The disaster has sparked a media maelstrom: A clinical psychologist says the current Common App catastrophe rightfully punishes procrastinators, and a former Dartmouth admissions officer thinks top colleges should abandon the Common App ship altogether!
LOW-INCOME, HIGH GRAD RATES. U.S. News & World Report lists the colleges with the best rates of graduation for low-income students receiving the Pell Grant.  (Note: Several top schools didn’t provide data and so weren’t evaluated.)
MONEY MATTERS. If you’re waitlisted at George Washington University, the obstacle to acceptance might be how much money your family makes.
Many colleges, in fact, do consider financial status when deciding on an applicant.  On the other hand, The Atlantic asks whether socio-economic affirmative action (instead of racial) might be a way to increase campus diversity.
SERVICE STATS.  Colleges like to brag that their grads go into public service, but Washington Monthly’s got the real story.  Newsflash: the best 20 schools for public service careers aren’t the top-ranked ones.  It’s places like College of William & Mary and Carleton College, for instance, that will help subsidize your public-service career after you graduate.
TUITION TRUTHS. Good news: You’ll pay the same amount for college that everybody paid 10 years ago!  A new College Board report shows that kids consistently pay about $23,000 a year for their higher education, despite soaring sticker prices.  But if $23,000 still won’t cut it for you....
DISCOUNT DEGREES. Controversial pilot programs in Florida and Texas are offering a small number of bachelor’s degrees for $10,000.  If you want to be a middle school math or science teacher, information technologist, or global trade and logistics specialist, head on over.
BE SCARED. Just in time for Halloween, it’s “The Creeping Horror of College Anxiety,” a short video from the National Association for College Admission Counseling. And TIME recounts the scariest, scandalous college admissions stories to date.

Almost immediately after I submitted my early decision application to Brown, I got my interview notification. I’d be meeting up with a recent graduate, now a PhD student in ethnomusicology, at a local coffee shop. “How Brown!” I thought to myself as I prepared my go-to interview outfit: black slacks, leather boots, and a patterned cardigan over a white t-shirt. For good luck, I’d wear a necklace my friend got me in China. Though I knew it was only a tiny component of my application package, I tried to have a successful interview, though I was pretty nervous. Was I supposed to order coffee? I wasn’t a big fan of coffee! But if I didn’t order coffee, what would I do with my hands? Getting a muffin would be childish. In the end I settled on getting black coffee—ultra-sophisticated!—and drinking it with feigned enthusiasm.
 
Interview questions were no surprise, based on what I’d been told to expect: Why did I want to go to Brown? What could I contribute to campus? What did I like to do with my spare time? What was a formative experience I’d had, an obstacle I’d overcome, an interesting sight I’d seen? I left the interview feeling relatively self-assured. I had no benchmark to compare the interview against, but I hoped I’d represented myself well. I hadn’t spilled coffee on myself, at least.
 
I continued to work on my applications, doing supplemental essays for nearly every school. I narrowed my choices down (thought not by much). My safety schools were George Washington University, Boston University, and Brandeis. My mid level schools were Tufts, WashU, and Wesleyan. My overly ambitious list of reach schools came out to Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Brown, Penn, and Amherst.
 
Before I knew it, early decision results were out for Brown. I received the disappointing news—deferral—with as much grace as I could muster. I hadn’t been rejected! Anything could happen between now and April! As 2009 turned into 2010, I sent in the last of my applications. Winter break ended, and along with a new term at school came the rest of my college interviews.
 
I started off with Wesleyan. Similar to Brown, my interviewer was a recent graduate and we met for coffee. I was immediately taken with the school—and him. He looked like a less-greasy Robert Pattinson with a prognathic jaw, and we established an immediate rapport. We lived in the same neighborhood, had attended the same Grizzly Bear concert a few months before, and shared a lot of other interests. It was an easy and relaxing interview, where I felt completely at ease asking all about his undergraduate experience at Wesleyan and fielding any questions he asked me. I left feeling much more enthused about Wesleyan as a school and more confident in my interview abilities going forward.
 
Not every interview went this smoothly, though. I nervously walked into my Yale interview at an optometry/opthamology practice a few weeks later. I was immediately thrown for a loop when I greeted my stern-looking middle-aged interviewer; I reached out for a handshake before realizing, seconds too late, that she was missing her right arm. I tried to cover my mistake while simultaneously processing that she was a one-armed eye surgeon. I was distracted by this thought for the rest of the interview, which was really unfortunate, because that woman could interview. I was asked challenging question after question, harder and more intellectually stimulating than any I’d encountered in previous interviews. I hoped my responses made some sense; I was making up half my answers, wildly guessing at what she might expect for these whip-smart questions. I left feeling invigorated but nervous; I couldn’t have been the best student she’d interviewed, but I knew I’d had a very unique and engaging interview experience nonetheless.
 
Most of the rest of my interviews went reasonably well. None blew me away like Wesleyan nor challenged me as deeply as Yale, but I felt I’d made an adequately favorable impression in each one nonetheless. My Harvard interview alone could be classified as a pure disaster. I was interviewed by an old man. He was clearly distracted throughout the interview and asked me maybe two questions about myself and spent the rest of his time talking about his life. For an hour. Making no impression is better than making a bad impression, I told myself, but I knew I hadn’t had a good interview. The news got worse a few months later: mere weeks before Harvard was to announce acceptances, they realized they didn’t have an interview on file for me. My interviewer had simply forgotten to submit a report and was now too busy with work to bother. I rushed into the admissions office for a last-minute interview with Harvard’s senior admissions officer, hoping this wouldn’t count against me, and praying for interview season to finally end.
 
At last it did. And all I had to do was wait.
The sixth installment of the College Campaign of 2010 is here. Read it now.
