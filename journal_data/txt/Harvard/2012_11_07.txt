After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Two years ago, I started working at the Boston Antiquarian Book Fair. When a friend of mine told me of a bookseller looking for an assistant, I imagined weekends spent caressing first-edition copies of “Ulysses” and “The Waste Land.” To my mind, books and literature were metonymically linked, and I couldn’t imagine that “books” would entail anything other than great works of literature.
A week later, Google searches revealed that the bookseller specialized in maps and prints. I was instantly reminded of the time I applied for work experience at Bloomsbury Publishing, only to be transferred to A&C Black, a subsidiary company that specializes in sports and ornithology. That week went down in my life’s history as one of the worst ever: I spent interminable hours doing mindless data entry and compulsively making myself cups of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate. A disappointing omen, but, for once, precedence was not prophetic. 
Antiquarian book dealers are a strange, eclectic group of people. Some are dour and serious and have the air of a Victorian schoolmaster or governess; others combine business and pleasure, spending book-fair weekends in hazes of inebriation and fine dining—either in celebration of a lucrative sale or purchase or as distraction and consolation for slow business.
Most of them defy definition and description. All, however, are walking, breathing variorums of hundreds of books but sometimes have little interest in the content of the book itself. Their concern is commercial, and the monetary and objective worth of a book often has little to do with its emotive and subjective value.
Working at the Antiquarian Book Fair, I was told many wonderful stories about books. I heard about the first-edition of “Finnegans Wake,” sold with a letter from the printers, reassuring the bookstore clerk that the book was not full of typos and misprints, and the first sentence of the book was indeed supposed to read “riverrun, past Eve and Adam’s….” Or about the 1931 booklet of “Haveth Childers Everywhere” printed by Criterion Miscellany, in which Dudley Fitts (Harvard student, poet, critic, translator and friend of Robert Fitzgerald) had diligently annotated the changes made to the text when it was eventually published as “Finnegans Wake” in 1939. 
In our world of cheap paperbacks and e-readers, hardcover books are rapidly becoming artifacts of a bygone era: we’ve come a long way from the individually hand-copied vellum manuscripts of pre-Gutenberg times, and perhaps we’ve lost something in the process. There’s an additional dimension to old or rare books, because they have their own stories that run parallel to the narratives they contain.
But these are ultimately superficial stories. Those very books—priceless, fascinating, and delightful though they may be—lose all their worth and vitality if they are not read. And too often, their monetary value renders them unreadable, as we fear damaging the precious objects themselves. What we love about novels, poems, and plays are their narratives and characters, the text itself; stories and ideas do not care what form they take, what vessel they are poured into—the words easily transcend the object that contains them.
In an English literature seminar last year, I fondly remember my professor disseminating photocopies of “Anna Karenina” from a copy he owned decades ago, eulogizing the benefits of cheap paperbacks which allowed him to scribble impulsive exclamations of wonderment (“Superb, so unexpected!”) in the margins. Ultimately, perhaps, this personal touch is infinitely more important than the impersonal histories of the objects themselves. Books are not collector’s items like any other: They’re not pages of stamps that chart the evolution of philately; they’re not diamond-encrusted Fabergé eggs; they’re not Damien Hirsts adorning the walls of a hallway. Books have to be read: Their potency comes from our reading of the text, their significance from our memories of reading.
In “Time Regained,” Proust writes: “A thing which we saw, a book which we read at a certain period does not merely remain for ever conjoined to what existed then around us; it remains also faithfully united to what we ourselves then were and thereafter it can be handled only by the sensibility, the personality that were then ours.” 
Walking around the Boston Antiquarian Book Fair in 2010, I saw many first-edition copies of Joyce’s “Ulysses,” guarded behind the glass of display cases. Perhaps one day, I’ll own my very own first edition, but for now I’m content with my battered $20 paperback copy. Its edges are frayed, whole chapters have detached themselves from the spine, and most pages are filled with my inane thoughts and observations—but I can carry it around with me everywhere, and it’s filled with the same wonderful words that were there when I first discovered Joyce.

It would not be outlandish to claim that Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar is the greatest eighties baby ever to pick up a microphone. His flow effortlessly glides through different vocal registers, the rhythmic patterns of his verses skittering frantically around each other. His language is vivid and abstract, his narrative perspective subtly shifting. He even often layers two or three differently pitched takes on top of one other, allowing himself to find a tonal Netherworld seldom reached by other rappers. He can switch his register at a split second’s notice, from trembling melancholy to gangster exuberance.
Last week, Lamar’s major label debut, “good kid m.A.A.d city,” ended its first week as the number one R&B/Hip-Hop album in the nation, sneaking into the number two spot on the Billboard 200, right behind Taylor Swift’s utterly brain-numbing “Red.” The album sold over 242,000 copies, easily contending with 2012’s R&B/hip-hop juggernauts Nicki Minaj and Frank Ocean, whose “Channel Orange” sold about 131,000.
Lamar started to garner major attention about a year ago with his 2011 breakout effort, “Section.80.” The album was an observational epic about Lamar’s generation: the listless, violent, and strung out crack babies born in the late eighties. On “A.D.H.D.,” the album’s standout track, Lamar inscribes himself as a social bystander, spiritually aloof from his tortured generation: “I’m in the house party trippin’ off / My generation sippin’ cough syrup like it’s water / Never no pancakes in the kitchen.” The album’s lush production merged the mid-nineties jazz-influenced hip-hop of A Tribe Called Quest with Outkast’s slightly spacier permutation.
If “Section.80” is the story of a drugged-out generation that Lamar at least partly eschews—he himself proclaims to neither drink nor smoke weed—then “m.A.A.d city” is the story of a confused adolescent growing up in Compton, pushing away his petty-minded family, and haltingly participating in his friends’ gangster lifestyle. The album’s skits, all of them narrated by Lamar’s friends and family (his mom and dad make the most remarkable and riotous appearances), frame in speech the Compton epic that Lamar weaves into song. His mother repeatedly implores him to bring back her car, while his father drunkenly demands the return of his “motherfuckin’ dominoes.” In another skit, Kendrick’s friend secures a bottle of liquor from a reluctant accomplice to soothe Lamar’s uneasiness: “Nigga, pass Dot the bottle. You ain’t the one that got fucked up. What you holdin’ it for? ... Dot, you good, my nigga? Don’t even trip, just lay back and drink that.” 
The skits thus frame an ambivalent portrait of Lamar’s position in his family, his crew, and his neighborhood. While Lamar seems to participate quite actively in his friends’ criminal undertakings, he also seems to be the least comfortable with the lifestyle they lead.
Lamar’s construction of his own vulnerability is where the genius lies in “good kid m.A.A.d city.” It allows him to speak frankly about the stark reality of his upbringing without ever climbing the pulpit; he remains with the congregation, ambivalently clinging to the social world he depicts. He’s a good kid struggling to sort out his own principles, and he’s trying on different personae for size. On several songs, his shifts in narrative perspective make it increasingly difficult to identify firmly with any one of Lamar’s alteregos. On “m.A.A.d City,” Lamar recalls his menacing enemies with his gangbanging cronies, but attributes their violent behavior to evolutionary necessity rather than malevolence: “We adapt to crime / Pack a van with four guns at a time / With the slidin’ door, fuck is up? / Fuck you shootin’ for if you ain’t walkin up you fuckin’ punk?” No track ends without at least partially subverting itself. This record is the halting and messy Bildungsroman of a youth growing up in a tumultuous post-crack urban landscape.
“Growing up in Compton is real unpredictable,” Kendrick remarked in a 2011 interview. “You might be going to the liquor store and that’s your life right there…. It’s basically about being aware of everything that’s around you.” This skittish paranoia seeps into “good kid m.A.A.d city,” driving Lamar to shift constantly between various alter-egos. He is at once a vicious gangster on “m.A.A.d. City,” a kid cornered into a fight walking home from Sunday school on “good kid,” a smooth-talking player on “Sherane,” and a murdered prostitute’s sister mired in the fast life on “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.” 
In short, Kendrick Lamar has given rap listeners the most wonderfully confusing and innovative rap epic of our generation. If you knew nothing of the Compton micro-generation coming of age in the crack-addled nineties, then you will after listening to “good kid m.A.A.d. city.”

Ironically, if every American understood why affirmative action is such a necessary component of the college admissions process, we would not need affirmative action anymore. If every American had full respect for and recognition of the past—its triumphs but as well its shameful evils—then we wouldn’t need affirmative action anymore. If every American fought earnestly against the enormous forces of structural racism and used their actions and their voice to combat the consequences of oppression, then we wouldn’t need affirmative action anymore. However, by no stretch of the human imagination have those conditions been fulfilled and, thus, affirmative action is still extremely necessary at this time in American history.
It is arrogant and inaccurate to believe that students admitted into a university as beneficiaries of affirmative action are students of diminished academic qualification. Affirmative action is neither a policy that relies on quotas nor a means by which deserving students of a majority demographic are maliciously stripped of an entitled offer. Rather, affirmative action is a policy that rightfully encourages admissions officers to keep a sensitive eye to a student’s context. Yes, that white student with a perfect GPA who scored a perfect score on the SAT deserved an admissions offer. However, so did that the minority student, replacing her, who succeeded despite structural forces depriving him of a high-quality education system and the resources it affords.
There are no doubt beneficiaries of affirmative action at Harvard. Yet despite the negative connotations which some have tried vehemently to attach to affirmative action, minority students do not have qualms over this consideration in their admittance. To the contrary, conversations over numerous email lists and social media outlets indicate that minority groups on Harvard’s campus know the value of their contribution to this community. These students have worked hard for their success. Contrary to the myth of under-qualification, many minority students have put in exponentially more time and work to prove they deserve a seat at the table—sometimes two, three times over. They are determined to overcome the vestigial racism that constantly questions their intellectual worth and academic capacity. They were granted admissions because of affirmative action, because of provisions that weighed their holistic potential within the context of their environment, and they will go on to be some of the most successful lawyers, politicians, professors, and surgeons in their communities.
And what exactly would an admissions policy without affirmative action look like? Does it mean turning a blind eye to an individual’s context? To their economic status, or race—all of which are huge factors in determining an individual’s identity? The truth is that a student’s ethnicity, race, and class all inform his or her perception of the world inherently because these same characteristics inform the world’s perception of them. Admissions is not wholly about the individual, but more often about the broader community and building a class of students, each highly capable of academic success. And how are we to define merit? By test scores and GPA’s alone? Therefore, it is reasonable that crucial aspects of identity including ethnicity, economic status, sexual orientation, and indeed race be taken into consideration when building a cohesive class. The admissions office does not expect me to strip myself of my racial and ethnic identity when I’m in a Barker seminar room, so why should they strip me of these different aspects of my world view when weighing the value of my contribution to the community in question?
In the race that is the American educational system, not all students are beginning from the same starting line, nor are they all taking the same path to success. Some have longer distances to run, others have more hurdles to jump. Some are even running barefoot. So if a rule comes along that acknowledges the additional burden and hardship of an individual striving toward reaching the finish line, why would we void the policy before we can ensure that all the contestants are running under equal conditions to begin with? Perhaps, if we are aiming to objectively provide equal opportunity then we should not be debating whether or not universities should have these affirmative action policies, but rather how to improve upon them. That being said, unless we are willing to accept the necessity of affirmative action, why it is not comparable to the admissions of legacies, short men, or other straw men, we will never reach the point at which we can leave the initiative behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We commend the efforts of both Harvard Kennedy School students and The Crimson to highlight gender diversity and the critical need to expand the representation of women at the School, elsewhere in education, in government, and in all sectors. The Crimson properly points out the role HKS can play in both inspiring more women to participate in government and serving as a model of diverse leadership. As Dean and Academic Dean respectively, and in the case of Iris, as Director of our Women and Public Policy Program, we embrace these goals.
The case for gender equity certainly includes the reasons described in the Crimson. Government does indeed deal with a great many gender-related issues from family planning to abortion, sexual harassment to equal pay, child care to family structure, and domestic violence to rape. And many more policies have a disproportionate impact on women. Women and children far outnumber adult men among the poor in the United States. At the same time, more women than men graduate from college in the United States and many other countries today. Women represent a large percentage of the nation’s teachers, and they are expanding their roles in the military.
Yet the best reason for greater gender equity may be even more fundamental—our nations need the best. We desperately need exceptional public leaders and innovative solutions to the overwhelming public problems facing the world. Any structure that systematically excludes half the population is losing out on the wisdom and insights of some of its most able citizens. Research, some of it conducted at the Kennedy School, demonstrates that more diverse working groups often produce better outcomes. Indeed WAPPP recently held a conference on “Closing the Gender Gap: The Business Case for Organizations, Politics and Society,” demonstrating the value of inclusive approaches in all sectors.
The obvious question is why has progress on faculty diversity been so slow? At the Kennedy School, as in most universities, some of the reasons are obvious. For one, tenured faculty turn over slowly. There are a limited number of new faculty hires each year, and the number qualifying for tenure is even smaller. In addition, most of our faculty are economists or political scientists, disciplines where the potential candidate pool is disproportionately male—there are significantly fewer female than male Ph.D. holders, and most existing faculty are men. Nonetheless, since David became dean, 45 percent of the newly tenured faculty members at HKS have been women, and the percentage of tenured women faculty has grown from 9 percent to 23 percent.
One suggestion for increasing diversity across universities is to look at faculty with less traditional academic backgrounds. At HKS, we already hire leading practitioners as faculty. These searches occur more frequently and the pipeline issues are less problematic. Thus, we have been able to identify and recruit outstanding practitioners and make those appointments in a shorter time frame. As a result, we have been able to attract and appoint a larger number of lecturers and senior lecturers from diverse backgrounds, and 42 percent of these positions are now held by women.
This is real progress, but we still have a long way to go. Drawing on “best practices” to support diversity, including research by our own faculty such as Iris and Professor Hannah Riley Bowles, we have introduced systematic mentoring of junior faculty, which is particularly important in supporting women faculty as they build their careers. And the Kennedy School also allows both leave and extra time to pursue tenure following the birth or adoption of a child and has been doing so for many years.
To attract a diverse pool, we define faculty searches as broadly as possible. Search committees are required to report to the faculty and the deans how they took diversity into consideration. And drawing on the very latest social science research, we are using “gender equality nudges” that have been proven successful in the evaluation process to improve our hiring outcomes. Specifically, we have sought to bundle multiple searches together to avoid some of the challenges faced by all schools that search for a single candidate at a time. Our goal is to find those truly exceptional people who our old systems might have missed.
The ways that policy and political attitudes affect the lives of women is front and center in the public discourse this fall. Harvard Kennedy School is part of that public conversation, and our ideas, students, faculty and alumni/ae are central to the direction attitudes and policy will take in the future. We are as dedicated to excellence through diversity within our own school as we are to the advancement of the ideas of equity and sound public policy in society at large.
David T. Ellwood is Dean and Scott M. Black Professor of Political Economy at Harvard Kennedy School. Iris Bohnet is Academic Dean, Professor of Public Policy, and Director of the Women and Public Policy Program at Harvard Kennedy School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, despite voter ID laws, closed polling stations, and entire towns that still had no power following Hurricane Sandy, over one hundred million Americans cast ballots on presidential, congressional, state, and local candidates, as well as dozens of important referenda. We are pleased that the general election resulted in a victory for Barack Obama, clearly the right choice for America and our endorsee for president.
Obama made many bold promises, first during his first four years and then during this campaign. With the support and cooperation of Congress—including Massachusetts’s newly elected Senator, Elizabeth Warren—we hope that he will make good on these promises.
According to the Crimson’s recent survey, Harvard students cited the economy and health care as the two most important issues in this election. We have high hopes that in his next four years as President, Barack Obama will be able to put our country and its people on sound economic footing. We expect him to strongly advocate for the repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act and support marriage equality for LGBTQ Americans, to protect women’s rights, to decrease military spending, and to use that money to finance important social programs. We are also relieved that the U.S. will not have to risk losing important programs like the American Care Act and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
A second Obama term is exciting, and we look forward to the president following through on his promises and leading our country until 2016.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There you have it, folks. It is finally over. The historic event that has colored the very first chapter in most Harvard students’ adult lives has reached its conclusion. No more primaries, ads, or gaffes to worry about. Everyone can get back to doing what they had been doing before this election season started.
As it turns out, that was quite a long time ago. The American punditocracy has been covering this horserace for 22 months. This extended cycle is a troublesome and oft-overlooked feature of the American political system. A two-year election cycle halves the amount of time presidents have for uninterrupted governance and distorts policy for a distressingly long time. Attempts for meaningful electoral reform should begin by examining the political infrastructure of contests abroad, some of which have legally mandated six-week or two-month campaigns.
A two-year presidential race engenders a host of negative implications. For one, it makes legislative deal making nearly impossible for a full two years. Second, it limits the amount of time politicians have to make politically thorny but essential policy decisions. Add that to the undue stress it causes millions of amateur politicos who nearly go into cardiac arrest at every twitch in the Intrade or Fivethirtyeight odds, and we have a national crisis on our hands.
Unfortunately, a critique of this system by the mainstream media is far from forthcoming. The American sensibility loves sport—the Super Bowl frequently breaks the record for most watched television program in United States history. The foremost function of the media, at least from their perspective, is to engage in a business. How better to make money than to appeal to what Americans like? Talking about winners and losers for twenty-two months is much more likely to capture the country’s attention than arcane references to “Fast and Furious” or “Dodd-Frank.” There is only so much the talking heads can say about the state of unemployment.
As the media prolongs the election cycle, candidates are forced to devote more time and money promoting their campaigns than ever before. This year, a whopping $6 billion has been spent on the presidential election, an amount that surpasses that of 2008 by $700 million. There is no telling where that number will go in the future, as outside interests are given more and more flexibility in funding their favorite frontrunner. A similar, if not worse, problem exists in elections in which there is an incumbent seeking reelection. He or she is forced to take valuable time out of his first job—governing the country—to convince the people to give him another term.
At its core, the election cycle is a misallocation of resources. While it may help a select few who participate in the business of electing (and cavorting with) politicians, it has a detrimental impact on those of us the leaders purport to represent. We can think of several more valuable ways to spend the capital wasted on a drawn out presidential campaign. America has $16 billion in debt, an ominous “fiscal cliff” approaching, and foreign policies exigencies with which to deal. It is a shame that these issues are ignored as the country turns the topic of its governance into a hyperextended athletic competition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a bright new day in America, filled with challenges and opportunities for the future. A key challenge we face as a species is generating enough energy to sustain and enhance our lives—and doing so in a way that can be relied on indefinitely. Currently, 77.6 percent of the energy produced in the U.S. comes from non-renewable fossil fuels, mostly natural gas, coal, and crude oil. Nuclear plants generate 10.6 percent of our energy, and the remaining 11.8 percent comes from renewable sources. Since global stores of non-renewable resources deplete over time, until we find a way to send organic matter back in time a few million years, we need to plan for a future in which they exist in far fewer quantities. This much is obvious before we even consider the impacts of harvesting and using non-renewables.
Still, renewable energy sources cannot presently meet global demand for energy. I often hear one of two diametrically opposed responses to this information: that fossil fuels are the only effective solution at present and that investment in renewable resources is wasteful, or that fossil fuels are destroying the planet and we should transition entirely to renewable energy immediately.
I would offer a compromise between the two: We should recognize that fossil fuels will compose a significant portion of our energy production in the near-term while at the same time investing considerable resources into making renewable energy abundant, efficient, and safe. While wind, solar, and nuclear energy get considerable attention, another promising solution to the Herculean task of global energy production lies in the hands of our smallest relatives, the humble microbes.
Microbes are an incredible tool from an engineering perspective, as they are programmable, self-repairing, ubiquitous, exist in limitless variety, and require little upkeep. While traditional biomass needs to be grown, taking up arable land that could house food production or forests, microbes can be grown anywhere with a light source and a supply of nutrients. Traditional solar panels can break down and degrade over time, but a microbial system can maintain population equilibrium ad infinitum.
There are two major methods through which microbes can be used to generate energy. The simplest method is to use microbes to generate simple organic compounds, which can be consumed just as any other biogas, bioethanol, or biodiesel. Another promising method employs microbial fuel cells, which harness electricity directly from the energetic activity of microbes.
Sweden recently made headlines by announcing a plan to import 800,000 metric tons of waste from other countries for energy production. The country generates 20 percent of its heat and a decent portion of its electricity by incinerating waste, which is used to power generators. While their incinerators have advanced measures to reduce emissions by collecting ash, flue gas, heavy metals, acids, and other byproducts, combustion of complex waste components is still a relatively inefficient and non-transportable mode of energy production. Were they to digest the organic compounds in their trash using microbes, they could produce hydrogen, natural gas, butanol, or ethanol as byproducts, which can be consumed both efficiently and portably, with a much cleaner end product. As a rough estimate, 100 pounds of plastic can be converted biologically into 70 pounds of oil, 16 pounds of natural gas, 6 pounds of ash, and 8 pounds of water.
Microbial fuel cells are less developed than microbe-assisted fuel production, but they show great promise for the future because direct production of electricity is far more efficient than combustion. Researcher Hong Liu’s lab at Oregon State University made headlines this summer by demonstrating that microbial fuel cells can not only generate electricity from wastewater, but that they could also sterilize and treat the water. Other researchers have created microbial desalination cells that use similar processes to generate electricity with a byproduct of desalinated seawater. Given that finding abundant sources of both water and energy will be major challenges to tackle in the coming decades, both of these technologies show incredible promise in providing abundant, clean energy and fresh, sterile water. It will be some time before these technologies can be employed on a global scale, but they are certainly a promising area for future research.
Providing abundant, cheap, renewable, and easily transportable energy will be one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Research that maximizes any of these variables for both renewable and non-renewable resources is laudable. Research into microbial energy sources, both through production of fuels and direct production of electricity, shows particularly great promise and could be a major stepping-stone on the path to a bright future.

Gchat, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr, Wordpress, Myspace, new Myspace. What does it all mean? If the barrage of information and new technology that is the social media age leaves you feeling like a lone byte beaming through the existential emptiness of space, fear not. FM is here to find (or construct) meaning for the conventions of these destabilizing times.
Skype:
The eye of the Skype camera is the eye of society concentrated into the small, apparently innocuous circle on your computer, as your data becomes party to the government and beyond. A conflation of Big Brother and Big Papa, Skype is the panoptican. It is bourgeois exhibitionism masquerading as connectivity. Every time you shimmy those clothes off for a sexy Skype sesh with your significant someone, you do so under the cold, calculating eye of the dominant discourse: cruel, impersonal, paternalistic, and extremely judgmental of your thighs.
Facebook Profile Picture:
The profile picture represents a futile attempt at essentialization of the self: The user selects a single image, one conglomeration of pixels and bytes, that he hopes can convey Who He Is to that girl he sits next to in math class.Self-image is not projected with sly subtlety but uploaded explicitly and unabashedly. There’s a fundamental honesty at play: “Here is how I want you to see me,” the user seems to say. But that upfrontness denies the individual the right to complexity—to an identity that requires more than what’s “worth a thousand words” to express.The self-aware user, unable to stomach being pigeonholed, eschews caricaturization—she exhibits an eclectic medley of pictures. She attempts to obfuscate, to hide from the medium that demands she choose symbols to manifest her capital “I” Identity.In selecting a file and clicking “upload,” we cry out for recognition from the collective consciousness of cyberspace.
Twitter Retweet:
As retweets proliferate and clog the twitterverse, unoriginal parroting threatens to become the status quo of online communication. The tweeter’s intellectual product becomes no more than the sum of others’ profundities, appropriated and re-appropriated through the unique lens of the individual’s web-addled consciousness. Gone are the days in which writers couched their intellectual plagiarism in literary allusions or quotations analyzed into the body of a new text. Instead, retweeting weaves a global web of intertextuality. Is the time to pronounce the death of originality upon us? Eh, that’d probably get a bunch of re-tweets, too.
Gchat:
While some say the
alienation of online
instant chatting tools is
a negative manifestation of
the existential loneliness of this
contemporary age, reducing
human contact to mere
sound bites, we say
Gchat is the next wave of
poetry. The heavily
enjambed lines and rich
colloquial tone of the
Gchat force us to ask: What is an
author? As our culture of social
media shifts the register from
prose to verse, Gchat
provides a new
model for collective authorship
as two (or more) subjectivities
grapple to articulate
primary experience.

Kind of like a fraternity only unique to Harvard....   I enjoyed many fabulous days and nights at the Delphic Club during college. The members and guests always promised an amazing crowd and fun times. While the basement wasn't the cleanest of places, it was perfect for the games we played, the music we danced to, and the mess we sometimes made...Delphic Club, I will remember and love you forever!

The checkouts are broken; employees are rude.
The pharmacists suck and have bad attitudes.
With unhonored sales and prices sky-high,
you'll wonder how CVS even survives.
When you need drugs, and sometimes we all do,
the pharmacy fails to release them to you.
Your medicine lost in a sea of white bags,
ne'er to be rescued; they cannot read tags.
You have a quick question, which salve is the best?
The employee stands straighter and puffs out his chest,
then ignores you completely and walks right on past.
I guess all that puffing was just pent-up gas.
A beverage, cold, to ward off the hot day,
is trapped in the fridge; there are staff in the way.
Ten minutes later, your drink is in hand.
you'll wait twenty more, though, before it gets scanned.
So your drink is now warm and you don't have your meds,
plus you paid twice as much as the circular said.
But despite all these losses, in one way you still win:
You'll know better than ever to come here again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This January, while many Harvard students will be participating in Wintersession programming on campus, 13 students will have the chance to explore the cultural aspects of Sicilian cuisine at a cooking school in a remote village outside of Palermo.
The first 13 students to sign up for the Wintersession program will have the opportunity to cook under the instruction of chef Fabrizia Lanza, participate in cheese, olive, and wine tastings, and visit historical sites in towns surrounding Vallelunga.
Shannon Stecher, a program coordinator at the Graduate School of Design, will direct the week-long program, called, “The Cultural Anthropology of Sicily Through Food.”
While attending classes at the Anna Tasca Lanza Cooking School, students will study permaculture, a system of ecological design that focuses on the sustainable architecture of gardens. The cooking school maintains a garden adhering to permacultural guidelines.
The basic idea of permaculture, according to Stecher, is that certain plants grow better next to each other due to symbiotic relationships. “For example,” Stecher said, “the lavender plant does better if you plant it next to thyme or oregano.”
Stecher said her primary goal is to teach students the agricultural philosophy behind the garden and to encourage them to explore the connection between food and culture.
“Sicilian cooking has a lot of history to it,” Stecher said. “Sicily has a colorful background of different civilizations conquering the island.”
According to Stecher, the development of traditional Sicilian dishes over time has interesting anthropological dimensions.
“Sicilians don’t use as much garlic as Northern Italians [and] they have a sweet tooth,” said Stecher.
The trip is open to all undergraduates, though students with a strong interest in anthropology and cultural studies will find it especially exciting, Stecher said.
College-led and student-initiated programming during Wintersession allows students to pursue a creative passion or develop a new interest during 10 days in January. Activities include volunteering, outdoor adventures, dance lessons, cooking workshops, and service and culture trips domestically and abroad.

On election day some students traveled across Cambridge—to the Friends Center on Brattle Street, Gund Hall on Broadway, Graham and Parks School, or Quincy House—only to find that they were not registered to vote.
“It was an unusually high number of people this year,” said Winnie Williams, the warden at the Gund Hall precinct.
Williams noted that many of those who arrived at the polls only to be disappointed had registered to vote in one of three ways: by filling out a form on freshmen study card day, by registering with campaign promoters for Elizabeth Warren, and by using TurboVote—a company that provides online voter registration forms.
At around 2 p.m. at the polling station inside Quincy House, official poll observer Susan Roosevelt estimated that seven prospective voters, all of whom said they had used TurboVote, were not registered.
Officials at the Cambridge Election Commission said they were too busy to comment during Election Day. Brian McNiff, the spokesman for the Massachusetts Secretary of State, said he was not aware of the issue.
“[Cambridge] obviously should pursue and have the city election commission look into it,” McNiff said.
TurboVote—a company started by Harvard Kennedy School students—offers students online voter registration forms, which can then be printed out or requested to be mailed to them.
The Institute of Politics covered the postage for all Harvard students who registered through TurboVote, according to Esten Perez, communications director at the IOP.
The registrants must then sign the form and mail it to their Election Commission, a second step that Williams said she heard many students had failed to complete.
“They think everything is done, but it isn’t. Nothing is valid until they sign something,” Williams said.
In other cases, students’ forms may have been lost in the mail or were not processed by the Cambridge Election Commission in time.
While Bostonians are able to check the status of their voter registration online, Cantabrigians must call the Cambridge Election Commission or view a list in the Cambridge Town Hall 20 days prior to the election.
One of the goals of TurboVote is to better track voter registration forms to try to analyze why the forms are not processed.
In the next year, TurboVote is partnering with 10 local election boards to improve their online registration, said Seth E. Flaxman, executive director and co-founder of TurboVote.
“They don’t have the resources themselves. We’re there to provide the technology,” Flaxman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Digital Public Library of America officially launches on April 18, 2013, anyone with access to a computer will be able to study and enjoy the “crown jewels” of Harvard’s Library system, which spans 73 physical libraries and approximately 17 million volumes.
The Harvard Library announced last Wednesday that it will contribute content from a number of its special collections to the DPLA, an online, not-for-profit initiative to digitize scholarly material from public and private libraries across the country.
“That, in general, is what I feel our responsibility is here at the library,” said Robert C. Darnton ’60, Harvard University librarian and one of the original visionaries behind the DPLA. “We have these great collections and now thanks to modern technology we can share our intellectual wealth.”
The announcement makes Harvard the DPLA’s first individual ‘content hub’—the term DPLA has given digital libraries with which it will work directly to acquire material. Leaders agreed that Harvard’s commitment is a big success for the endeavor.
“It is a major vote of confidence in the system,” said John G. Palfrey, Jr. ’94, President of DPLA’s Board of Directors. “What Harvard is planning to do is share some of the crown jewels of its library collections.”
Darnton cautioned against “exaggerated expectations” and emphasized that the launch will be only the “beginning” of a massive digital library. But Harvard’s special collections represent a unique contribution to the DPLA’s offerings and feature some “fabulous” content, he added. University collections that have already been digitized include a plethora of mediums, from daguerreotypes of the moon and early manuscripts of musical scores by J. S. Bach and Mozart, to field notes and diaries from naturalist Louis Agassiz and original trial records and maps from around the world.
The library has not yet finalized which of these materials will go online first, but the decision will be made in “a matter of weeks, not months,” Darnton said.
Material in the special collections is usually older and already in the public domain—a huge advantage as the DPLA continues to navigate copyright law in striving for open access to as large a collection of material as possible.
“The copyright issue is, in my opinion, the most difficult problem that the DPLA faces—and we’ve got lots of problems,” Darnton said. “It won’t be a great library if we can’t make material available from 1964, 1923. We’ve got a third possible copyright date of 1893. Imagine if we were unable to make available to the American public any book published after 1893.”
There are certain ways to work around copyright law—especially for material out of print—without hurting authors or publishers, he said. The DPLA is also exploring the fair use element of copyright law, which allows a book under copyright to be digitized depending on the purpose of its use.
The DPLA already has seven ‘service hubs’—including the Kentucky, Oregon, and South Carolina Digital Libraries, in addition to the Boston Public Library’s Digital Commonwealth Project—that aggregate content and metadata from surrounding public and private libraries. In return, said Kenny Whitebloom, a member of the DPLA secretariat, these repositories help local libraries increase digitization efforts and expose rich, but often unknown, collections.
“DPLA is seeking to connect our various digital repositories and institutions across the United States through a single outlet,” said Whitebloom. “The really amazing stuff is going to get more visibility—reignite some sort of interest in local history.”
As the DPLA looks to expand the content it will make available in April, Harvard’s involvement is especially promising because of its potential to inspire support from other universities, who often think that transferring content from existing digital databases to the DPLA is cost-prohibitive, according to Darnton.
“We have to convince them that it won’t cost anything,” he said. “The DPLA’s front-end interface has been designed in such a way to favor this.”
A number of institutions have already expressed interest following in Harvard’s footsteps, said Palfrey. “We are very hopeful that other libraries will follow suit,” he said.
The Harvard Library’s decision to support DPLA is the most recent in a number of efforts by the country’s second-largest library to promote digitization of collections and open access. After expressing concerns about Harvard’s ability to maintain journal subscriptions in tandem with rising costs from publishers, the library made 12 million bibliographic records public in April of this year. The Faculty Advisory Council to the Library also circulated an appeal to faculty in the spring, encouraging professors to publish in and patronize journals committed to free, open access.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama swept to victory on Tuesday night, sparking celebrations across campus among Harvard students thrilled to see the president reelected.
Cheers rang from the dorms around Harvard Yard, and members of the Harvard University Band marched out in freezing weather to play the national anthem in front of the John Harvard statue. One student ran through the Yard draped in an American flag.
Students—more than three-quarters of whom supported Obama over Republican opponent Mitt Romney in a recent Crimson poll—rejoiced at watch parties in many Houses and campus hangouts.
In the steamy interior of the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub, packed with students munching on wings and following CNN on a big screen, election viewers stood on tables and hugged the nearest friend. As the room erupted into chants of “U.S.A.” and “Obama,” Matthew L. Maxwell '15 enthused, “I don’t have words. I have syllables. Sweet baby Jesus.”
Another student embraced her friend and shouted, “It’s over. It’s over.”
Obama’s victory marks the triumph of an administration that championed health care and immigration reform, crafted the bailout of the auto industry, and poured billions into an economy struggling in the wake of the 2008 recession.
The economic concerns of American voters shaped the progression of the campaign, as candidates parried over the lukewarm economic climate. Romney campaigned on a platform to shrink the government, ultimately failing to craft a message that could unseat the incumbent president.
Adan Acevedo ’13, president of the Harvard College Democrats, called the result “a resounding endorsement of President Obama to keep fighting for the middle class.”
News outlets announced as election night went on that Obama had carried the crucial swing states of Colorado, Iowa, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, enough to reach the necessary 270 votes to win in the electoral college. Florida and Virginia remained too close to call when newscasters announced Obama’s victory.
Until Tuesday, the polls showed Romney and Obama within a few points of each other. During the first debate, Romney’s unexpectedly strong performance narrowed the previously significant gap between the candidates to thrust Romney ahead. Since then, the candidates ran neck-and-neck as the weeks wound down until Election Day.
As the candidates devoted the final weeks of the campaign to canvassing, Harvard students also hit the streets, venturing to New Hampshire and Ohio to try to push their chosen candidates over the edge.
“Campus has been very energized,” Zak T. Aossey ’14 said. “People can make a difference.”
During the weekend preceding the election, 203 students—a record high for the—showed up to campaign in New Hampshire, according to Acevedo.
Harvard rallied around Obama financially as well. Obama, who graduated from Harvard Law School, raised $579,865 from Harvard-affiliated donors by the end of September, dwarfing Romney’s $60,636, according to Federal Election Commission filings.
Their contributions formed part of the rush of money into both presidential campaigns that made this election cycle the most expensive in American history.
As students gathered all over campus to watch the results, the Institute of Politics brought a wide spectrum of Harvard undergraduates together for a watch party led by C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, the director of the IOP.
Rachel B. Bervell ’13 remarked that the election had a unifying effect on the student body. “It’s really interesting to see everyone together,” she said. “You don’t see this often.”
During the party, Grayson phoned David Axelrod, a senior Obama adviser, and broadcasted the call at the forum.
“This is a close race. We’ve prepared for a close race,” Axelrod said, speaking before Obama’s victory was secured. He said the early election returns encouraged the Obama campaign.
Following news of the election result, patriotically hued balloons dropped from the forum ceiling onto students who shouted, “Four more years!”
In Adams House, where students camped out in the dining hall to do homework and snack on popcorn as they watched the CNN returns on a screen above their heads, David F. Sackstein ’14 said, “I’m very excited and very relieved. As always, I’m proud to be an American.”
But others were lukewarm about the electoral evening.
“I can’t wait for all the political statuses on Facebook to end,” said Forrest K. Neill ’15.
The celebration in the Yard was lackluster in comparison to the raucous eruption of joy that followed the president’s victory in 2008.
As the political hubbub dies down, Richard Parker, a lecturer at the Kennedy School, discussed the aftermath of the campaign and looked back on Obama’s first term.
Obama “came into office looking like he would be one of the three major transitional presidents of the last 100 years, along with Reagan and Roosevelt,” Parker said. Yet the President failed to move the country toward a full economic recovery, he continued.
Freed of the burden of a looming reelection campaign, Obama now faces the challenge of crafting a legacy over the next four years.
“It’s up for grabs,” Parker said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thirty-six-year Congressional veteran Ed Markey secured the Fifth Congressional seat once again Tuesday night, winning out over Republican challenger Tom Tierney by a margin of about 3:1.
The Fifth Congressional District, newly reshaped during Massachusetts’ redistricting earlier in the year, encompasses parts of central Cambridge including Harvard’s campus. Previously, this area was represented by Congressman Michael E. Capuano, who was elected Tuesday to the new Seventh District.
Markey’s longtime incumbency and the left-leaning slant of the district prompted political experts and community members to anticipate his victory prior to the election.
“Honestly, this is Massachusetts,” said local politics pundit Robert Winters. “The Democrats just win the races and there’s not really a contest.”
After he voted in Cambridge on Tuesday, Cantabrigian Nunzi M. Sapuppo ’77 said, “Ed Markey’s done a great job.”
Democratic political strategist Mary Anne Marsh added that because of Markey’s strong efforts on the campaign trail, “what could have been a race and could have been a challenge doesn’t turn out to be.”
Markey, a ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee, has championed legislation to promote the use of alternative energy.
The Massachusetts native is also the Dean of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation and spoke at the victory rally of U.S. Senator-elect Elizabeth Warren in Boston on Tuesday evening.
As Markey captured a seat in Washington, Democrats Marjorie C. Decker and Sal N. DiDomenico both won uncontested elections to represent districts that include most of Harvard’s campus on Beacon Hill.
DiDomenico, a state senator since 2010, currently chairs the Joint Committee on Community Development and Small Businesses. The Everett resident emphasized jobs as “always our number one priority in the state.”
Decker, who has garnered a reputation as a strong supporter of unions and veterans during more than a decade on the Cambridge City Council, said that in the State House, she would continue to fight for the issues she has championed.
Cambridge resident Tom O’Leary said of Decker, “She’s very pushy, but she endeared herself to us in numerous ways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While voters across the nation cast their votes on hotly-contested national races, a resounding majority of Massachusetts residents voted yesterday to legalize the use of medical marijuana. Physician-assisted suicide, the other issue put to voters on the ballot, remained contested until the early hours of the morning. At press time, the measure seemed headed to a narrow defeat.
Question 3 on voters’ ballots, entitled “Medical Use of Marijuana,” included provisions to legalize cannabis use by patients with “debilitating medical conditions” and sanctions the creation of 35 medical marijuana dispensaries across the Commonwealth.
Over 60 percent of Massachusetts voters yesterday declared their support for the initiative, which was heavily favored to pass according to polls by The Boston Globe and Suffolk University.
“I just don’t really get what the big deal is,” Laura E. N. Gullett ’16 said. Gullett, who voted in favor of legalization, noted that marijuana is considered a viable treatment for many diseases and was pleased the law had passed.
Federal law categorizes marijuana as a Schedule I drug, meaning that it is not officially recognized to have any medical benefits. However, with the passing of Question 3, Massachusetts has become the eighteenth state to permit the use of medical marijuana within its borders.
Attorney John S. Scheft ’81, an opponent of medical marijuana legalization, expressed serious concern about the text of the provision, pointing out that the new law expands the definition of debilitating conditions to include “other conditions as determined in writing by a qualifying patient’s physician.”
Now that the law has passed, Scheft said that he is not sure what the next steps are for medical marijuana opponents. He said he plans to closely watch the regulations that the Massachusetts Department of Public Health creates under this new law.
Voters in the state also weighed in on two other ballot initiatives, including a law that would legalize physician-assisted suicide and a law regarding the sharing of automobile repair information.
Question 2 on voters’ ballots, entitled “Prescribing Medication to End Life,” was down by a slim margin at press time. The initiative would have allowed physicians to prescribe medication to end a terminally-ill patient’s life at the patient’s request.
The ballot question enjoyed strong support from many Harvard Medical School faculty, but was ultimately defeated after a strong campaign by opponents. Students who voted yesterday voiced their disappointment at the results of the referendum.
“Overall, terminally-ill patients, if they are going to die, should have the right to ask a doctor to end their life for them,” Jennifer W. Leung ’16 said. “If someone is terminally-ill, they shouldn’t have to go through that pain.”
The final ballot initiative, which requires automobile manufacturers to share information necessary for repairs with independent mechanics and customers, was voted into law by a landslide.
The new legislation, entitled “Right to Repair,” is a stricter version of a compromise bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature earlier this year, forcing automobile companies to comply with regulations within the next two years.

In its final home game of the season, the Harvard men’s soccer team (3-10-3, 0-5-1 Ivy) came out on top, besting Holy Cross (5-10-2, 2-3-2 Patriot League) last night in a 2-0 shutout. Led by standout play from its seniors, the Crimson picked up its second win at Soldier’s Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium and its third victory of the season.
“Any time you win you’re happier,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “It’s good to see a little bit of self-belief this late in the season. The reality is, we’re not playing for a championship. Some of the self-motivation was there tonight.”
The match against the Crusaders was originally scheduled to be played at Holy Cross last Tuesday, but the effects of Hurricane Sandy forced postponement and relocation of the contest.
In the final home game of their Harvard careers, the senior class led the Crimson’s offensive charge. Seniors Brian Rogers and co-captain Richard Smith each netted goals for Harvard in the first half. Smith also anchored the Crimson’s solid defense, which shut down the Crusaders’ offense en route to Harvard’s second shut-out victory of the year.
Neither team was dominant out of the gates. The Crimson was unable to capitalize on some early scoring opportunities, and the teams traded possession for the first thirty minutes of play, with neither team able to hold the ball in the midfield.
“We felt in this game that we were probably going to be a little stronger in terms of possession and creating chances,” Junot said. “So, from our perspective, we thought if we were patient but at the same time persistent, opportunities would come.”
The team’s patience paid off. With about 17 minutes left in the first half, Rogers centered himself in front of the goal and chipped the ball over a Holy Cross defensemen. The ball bounced off the right post and found the back of the net, putting Harvard up, 1-0.
Less than five minutes later, 31:33 into the period, Smith added another goal for the Crimson, this time a header off of sophomore midfielder David Barna’s corner kick. The ball landed inside the endline after deflecting off the underside of the crossbar to give the senior defenseman his first goal of the season.
“Throughout the season, we’ve had a lot of set kicks,” Smith said. “We’ve been practicing [them] a lot, especially towards the end of the season. This was one of the first times that it came off [as planned]. You could say that the practice paid off for us then.”
The Harvard back line provided solid defensive coverage throughout the night, leaving the Crusaders with very few opportunities to find the back of the net.
One of Holy Cross’s only dangerous scoring opportunities occurred early in the first half. Less than nine minutes into play, a defensive breakdown by the Crimson gave the Crusaders junior midfielder Monty Carlos an open look on net, but the shot missed wide right.
“I thought our back line performed [well],” Junot said. “Anytime you have a shutout, the back line and the goalkeeper did very well.”
Freshman goalkeeper Evan Mendez recorded three saves en route to his first full-game shutout, while Holy Cross goaltender Kevin Wright posted four.
The second half of play continued much like the start of the first. Neither team saw much action in front of the net. The Crusaders had a scoring opportunity off a corner kick by senior midfielder Pat McMahon at 60:21, but the offense was unable to convert on one of its best scoring chances of the night. With less than three minutes to play in regulation, a Holy Cross foul gave Harvard a free kick from outside the penalty box. Freshman Oliver White nudged the ball to co-captain Scott Prozeller, who got a good leg on it, but missed the shot wide right.
The Crusaders edged out the Crimson in shots, 12-11, and tied Harvard, 6-6, in corner kicks for the match. Still, Holy Cross failed to capitalize on the few scoring opportunites that Harvard allowed and was unable to mount a comeback in the final stages of the contest.
Though the end of the season is within sight, Harvard remains fully committed to ending its lackluster season with strong play. A victory this weekend in its final matchup against Penn would serve as redemption for an otherwise disappointing season.
“Even though we haven’t got a championship to play for, it’s really important that we end the season on a high,” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While there are many skills that good coaches possess, the ability to make adjustments is what can truly make a coach stand out. Any average Joe can form a game plan or draw X’s and O’s, but the only best coaches recognize when changes need to be made and can execute them in his team’s interest.
In some sports, the adjustments that a coach makes are obvious. Everyone knows when a basketball coach switches from man-to-man to zone defense, or when a soccer coach subs in a set of fresh legs late in a soccer match. But in sports like cross country, common spectators are largely unaware of a coach’s influence through things like training plans and racing strategies.
For this reason, I want to draw attention to the adjustments that Harvard coach Jason Saretsky made in his team’s training regimen for the 2012 season after a disappointing conclusion to the squad’s 2011 campaign.
In the middle of the 2011 season, the Crimson turned in what appeared to be a breakout performance at the Paul Short Invitational, placing in the top 10 out of a deep 40-plus-team field. Then-sophomore James Leakos had his best showing of the season at the meet, and later remarked that he and the rest of the team were so excited about their performance that they pushed themselves too hard at practice in the following weeks.
By the end of the season, be it by overuse or sheer bad luck, most of the team’s top finishers from Paul Short, including Leakos, sustained injuries that rendered them unable to compete.
This year, instead of aspiring to repeat the impressive showing at the Paul Short Invite, Saretsky held his top runners out of competition during the week of the meet. Realizing that Paul Short occurred when his team was shifting from strength and aerobic workouts to race-specific exercises, he decided that his runners would be better served if this transition were not interrupted by a race.
“That was one of the changes that I think really helped the men’s team from a training standpoint,” Saretsky said. “They didn’t have a race in the middle of that transition phase.”
Acknowledging the excitement that followed the Paul Short meet in 2011, Saretsky also worked with his team to ensure that they wouldn’t allow their post-race emotions to affect how they approached training in the ensuing weeks.
“It’s really the subtle things, in terms of training,” Saretsky said. “As much as there’s a science behind it, it’s more of the art of coaching that separates good coaches from great coaches. There’s not some sort of magic formula or recipe for success.”
While Saretsky is correct in saying that training for success in long-distance running is anything but formulaic, he was definitely onto something with the adaptations that he made in the Crimson’s approach to workouts.
In order to accurately relay the impact of Saretsky’s adjustments, allow me to explain Harvard’s 2011 and 2012 Heptagonal Championships (the Ivy League championship meet) more fully.
A year ago, all of the Crimson’s top runners on the men’s team watched as a badly weakened roster sputtered to a seventh-place finish.
Now, you might be tempted to interpret “all” and “top runners” in my previous sentence loosely. Don’t.
Literally, of Harvard’s five scoring runners from Paul Short, a total of zero ran at Heps. The unexperienced squad that competed for the Crimson at the meet ran hard, but any hopes of having real success in 2011 were dashed due to injuries.
Fast-forward a year, and the story is drastically different. About two miles into the men’s race at the 2012 Heps, the Crimson was sitting in a tie for third place and in striking distance to win the team title. James Leakos, who didn’t even compete in last year’s race, was battling eventual-winner Chris Bendtsen of Princeton for the lead until the last 600 meters.
Though Leakos and the rest of the Harvard squad faltered in the final stages of the championship meet, their sheer participation in the championship meet represents a significant improvement that took place since last year.
The simple fact is that the men’s cross country team was stronger in 2012 than in 2011, in part due to Saretsky’s coaching. And if we’re going to criticize and scorn coaches when they mismanage lineups or don’t call a timeout, the least we can do is recognize them when their efforts make their teams better.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most Harvard students, the end of the spring term marks the triumphant conclusion of another year of college, with four months of shirked responsibilities and lazy summer days to look forward to. Some students travelled abroad, others took the opportunity to get internships and network for the future. But for a small group of varsity soccer players, the start of summer meant the opportunity to travel halfway around the world to the backwaters of Africa in the hopes of uplifting the local populace through as simple a gesture as teaching them the game of soccer.
 
This past summer, Crimson soccer players sophomore Lauren Urke and junior co-captain Peyton Johnson spent two weeks near the capital city of Kampala, Uganda, in the sweltering African summer heat working with Coaches Across Continents. The program, which aims to improve the quality of life in third-world countries using soccer as a tool for social development, partnered the Harvard athletes with local soccer coaches, teaching them skills and drills that they could in turn instill in youth players. Over the course of two weeks, Urke and Johnson instructed approximately 20 coaches, who then coached teams of around 20 players of their own. In total, around 400 Ugandan children of differing skills and ages were impacted by the program.
 
“As the week progressed, it mostly started with us coaching them through drills and running the sessions,” Johnson said. “As the week went forward, the aim was obviously that when we left they would be able to coach their own teams with things that they’d managed to learn.”
 
The Crimson players would instruct the coaches through drills for a few hours in the morning, and got the chance to work with the various individual teams in the afternoon. In addition to teaching the coaches soccer techniques, the main point of the program was to teach the community leaders and youth important social development skills, such as conflict resolution, problem solving, confidence, and finding one’s voice. These important social ideas were framed in the context of soccer drills and games to spark the interest of young players who would otherwise have no access to this sort of knowledge.
 
“A game would be very competitive,” Urke said. “We would wait for disagreements to occur, then talk to them about how they can approach those [issues].”
 
Urke and Johnson were not the first Crimson athletes to be involved in Coaches Across Continents. The organization was founded by Harvard graduate and former soccer player Nick Gates ’91.  Gates spent years travelling the world and quickly realized that soccer could serve as a vehicle for social change.
 
"What is needed is not another NGO doing the same things as some of the wonderful existing groups,” Gates said in 2006, two years before Coaches Across Continents launched its pilot program. “What is needed is a group who can educate and train teachers, coaches and volunteers so that they can use soccer to change lives.”
 
In 2008, Coaches Across Continents began running a single clinic in Tanzania. Now, less than five years later, the company has expanded to its present scope of 40 programs in 15 different countries.
 
Each year, members of both the men’s and women’s teams participate in the program. Both Johnson and Urke were recruited to join Coaches Across Continents by senior teammate Alicia Johnson, who had travelled to Africa the previous summer with the program. Alicia Johnson, in turn, had been intrigued by the program after hearing the experiences of former teammate Sophie Legros, who had travelled with the program two summers before and was among its first volunteers. Legros and Gates spoke to team members about the organization and encouraged the Crimson to participate in the venture.
 
“What I really took away was how much they embraced us being there,” Alicia Johnson said.  “Despite the diversity, they were so welcoming and we felt like we really made an impact in the community. They really accepted us but also our message and our mission.”
 
The senior was so moved by her work with the program that she now remains very involved in the company, promoting Coaches Across Continents and garnering financial and personnel support for its ventures. Last year, Alicia Johnson helped organize an athlete formal and ran a silent auction at a home game, with all proceeds from both events going towards the organization.
 
Each year, Coaches Across Continents looks for more participants to travel on future ventures, and not necessarily varsity athletes. Even volunteers with little competitive soccer experience have travelled with the program and made an impact. The organization also holds fundraisers to raise money for its programs and supplies. When Urke and Johnson travelled this past summer, they brought soccer balls to give to the locals at the completion of the program.
 
Despite their compact schedule, Urke and Peyton Johnson were able to get a lot of instruction in in the two short weeks that they were there. After learning new drills in the morning, the coaches would run more and more of the sessions each day by themselves, gradually implementing what the Crimson players were able to teach them. By the last day, the Ugandan coaches were running entire practices by themselves.
 
“I think that our impact was most visibly felt on the last day of the program,” Peyton Johnson said. “The coaches gave us some small form of gratitude from their family farm; avocados were a popular gift. They made us bracelets or soccer balls out of twine.”
 
The two players were also immensely grateful of the lessons that they in turn were able to learn from the African community.
 
“I think one thing I left with was a greater appreciation for the sport that I play and love,” Peyton Johnson reflected. “It’s obvious that soccer crosses cultures…but I don’t think I really appreciated until I went over there how soccer can do more than just entertain and foster a competitive message. It’s also a really great means for grabbing people’s attention and spreading messages to people that might otherwise turn a deaf ear.”

This morning, Flyby headed to the polls to see what people were saying about today's election. Here are a few overheard gems:"I woke up for this?"
"So glad I'm not 17 anymore."
"Wait... Do you vote when you're 18 or 21?"
"Where do I get my sticker?!"
"God, I wish I lived in Ohio."
"If you don't vote, you can't bitch."
"If Obama loses, I'm going to give you the silent treatment for a week."
"This is exciting. I might actually stay up past 10 p.m. tonight!"

As Harvard undergraduates exited the polls today, there was one resounding consensus: Elizabeth Warren would make a better PAF than Scott Brown. Ninety percent of student voters who spoke with Flyby after casting their ballots today said they would trust Warren over Brown to show them the ropes of freshman life. Here are a few other things we learned from Flyby's exit polls.
Which political party would throw a better election bash?
 
Regardless of how they voted, Harvard students agreed that Democrats would throw a better election party than Republicans. Of the voters who emerged from the curtained booths, none decided that a conservative celebration would be wilder than a liberal rager.
If you could assign a spirit animal to represent an independent party, what animal would you choose?
Results included: panda, white elephant, possum, baboon, giraffe, otter, and some kind of small forest animal.
Jill Stein's Green Party, in particular, received responses like an ocelot or a banana slug. Two students decided that a leprechaun would be the best spirit "animal."
Which vice presidential candidate would make a better Adams House mascot?
Paul Ryan: 53%
Joe Biden: 47%
Those who voted for Ryan listed his fit body as a prominent reason for their decision. Biden advocates listed his giggle, winning smile, and subtle pretension as reasons to replace the acorn with a vice presidential candidate.
Would you rather be in a study group with the Romney boys or the Obama girls?
Obama sisters: 53%
Romney brothers: 47%
One word to describe the feeling of losing your election virginity?
 
Answers included the following: exhilarating, empowering, nerve-wracking, scary, anti-climactic, stimulating, jubilant, monumental, Obasmic, satisfying, easy.

A rapidly spreading viral sensation is debunking negative stereotypes of MIT students as boring. In a matter of days, MIT has received more than four million hits on their version of the popular "Gangnam Style."
The original song, produced in South Korea, has made it big in the United States, with people everywhere mimicking its signature galloping dance move. The MIT parody starts at the school's numerical "Alchemist" statue and makes its way throughout campus, featuring multiple student groups and professors. Among them is Noam Chomsky, the renowned linguist and political activist. In his seven-second cameo, Chomsky takes a drink from his coffee cup before reciting "Oppan Chomsky style." Professor Eric Lander, who played an instrumental role in the Human Genome project, also makes an appearance; in the video, he dances and jumps on top of his desk with the lead singer, Richard Yoon '13. Eddie Ha '13 edited and directed the short.
As it turns out, Harvard is brewing a similar project of its own. Karen K. Y. Kim '13 says that the Korean Association is working on something, but shhh....it's on the down low. Until then, we tip our hat off to you, MIT. Well done—well done, indeed.
CORRECTION: Nov. 7, 2012
An earlier version of this post said that the lead singer was Eddie Ha. Instead, the lead singer is Richard Yoon.

Last night, America reelected President Barack Obama, Massachusetts voted to send Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren to the senate, and the voters of Colorado legalized recreational marijuana. But long before any of that, there was the FM Political Issue.
We gave you a jukebox, so you would have music to listen to all Election Day. We provided for you a list of three different, equally arbitrary ways to predict the election. And, in the meantime, we had an examination of the third-party life of a College student.  
We talked and talked—to an outgoing congressman, a frustrated professor, and a Ph.D. student who Googles. And we asked every single one of them about politics.  
You know that kid who is taking the semester off to campaign? No? Well, we do. You know that kid who is transparently preparing years in advance for his/her presidential campaign? Yup, we do, too.
And then, just to make sure you didn't get confused, we drew it out Venn Diagram style and campe up with a surprisingly nuanced divide: Swing States and Swingers.
The popular vote still has yet to be fully tallied—we hope you can use this coverage to keep yourself in the electoral spirit for just a bit longer.

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
At the height of lunchtime, it is nearly impossible to snag a seat at Crema Café. The menu of this coffee shop boasts everything from lattes decorated with swirled foam art to delectable cupcakes recently featured on the Food Network's "Cupcake Wars."
In addition to drinks and baked goods, Crema Café offers an extensive food menu that includes sandwiches, salads, soups, and quiches.
One of Crema's top selling items is the Spinach Artichoke Chicken Sandwich ($6.95), made with grilled chicken breast, artichoke spread, and wilted spinach pressed on homemade focaccia. Seasoned with plenty of herbs, the focaccia had beautiful grill marks and a crispy exterior thanks to the panini machine. The big chunks of chicken breast were slightly dry, but the creaminess of the artichoke spread helped to balance out the overall texture.
Turkey & Jicama Slaw Sandwich ($7.50) packed generous slices of house roasted turkey, jicama slaw, avocado, bacon, and ancho chile vinaigrette in between a toasted homemade baguette. The turkey slices looked and tasted like they were carved right off an oven-roasted turkey on Thanksgiving. Although the jicama slaw added nice crunchiness to the sandwich, it spilled out all over and made the sandwich really messy to eat. The pieces of avocado could have been chunkier and bigger. Still, a very delicious sandwich.
