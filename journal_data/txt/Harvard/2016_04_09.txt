After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In some ways, saying Meghan Trainor has had a “roller-coaster career” would betray a misunderstanding of how roller coasters work. She somehow won the Best New Artist Grammy in 2016 despite releasing two massively successful singles in 2014, solidifying her status as “the new person you have to know about now.” With her most recent single, “NO,” marking her fifth consecutive top-15 hit, her trajectory appears to be relentlessly upward, more reminiscent of Voyager 2 than the Millennium Force.
But for feminists, Trainor has built her career on the familiar sensation of soaring to delightful heights only to plunge, seconds later, to gut-wrenching depths. The chorus of her breakthrough “All About That Bass” implores women, “Don’t worry about your size”—so far, so good—for the empowering reason that “boys like a little more booty to hold at night.” Critics also alleged thin-shaming and appropriation. Her tracks “Dear Future Husband” and “Title” drew similar ire: In each case, she essentially says to hold men to high standards, a pretty innocuous message, but haphazardly sets off more established feminist alarm bells along the way that one would think possible given the brevity and repetitiveness of the songs.
So forgive those who spent their first viewing of the music video for “NO,” an anthem for rejecting unwanted male advances, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Happily, this (white and male) reporter found no obvious transgressions on those social justice axes. Trainor basically does the usual lip-sync-and-dance-team music video, perhaps inspired by late-’90s Britney. In the intro, she walks toward the center of an industrial warehouse, each step marked by a nauseatingly loud click of a high heel, as other women sprint dramatically to the scene. They do some pretty solid dance moves. Every once in a while, for some reason, a silhouette on a red background joins the terpsichorean fun. Then, suddenly, everyone’s in fishnets, touching each other. The women on The Crimson Arts Board tell me it’s probably fine—maybe even empowering.
Once we stop worrying that the next lyric out of Trainor’s mouth will be “he’s not entitled to you unless you’re drunk” or something, though, we’re left with the video qua video. It’s definitely a new look for Trainor, whose aesthetic has previously ranged from pastel ’50s to slightly more revealing ’50s: “NO” is industrial, gritty, and sexy. The problem, though, is that “NO,” the song, is not sexy. It’s not just “not sexy”: It’s anti-sexy. It’s about rejecting the male gaze. So why the shots of Trainor on her knees touching her chest, shots so short they almost seem like they’re meant to be subliminal? They’re not objectionable in and of themselves, they’re just so dissonant with the song’s content. Why are they in this particular video? The attempted fierceness makes sense, but Trainor doesn’t really embrace it: At one point, she smiles invitingly at the camera while saying, “You need to let it go.”
The girls all touching each other in fishnets also raise questions when backed by these lyrics. Does it suggest that straight women like Trainor don’t need men because they could always turn lesbian for a bit? Is it another shot meant to amp up the song’s sexuality, just commodifying lesbians yet again for the male gaze? Or are these accusations all just reaching? Maybe I need to let it go. Maybe Trainor got so much closer to making an unambiguously acceptable feminist anthem that we can just hail this as a step forward and enjoy her trying to look like she’s enjoying these dance moves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 9, 2016, at 12:45 a.m.
Jimmy Vesey, the outgoing co-captain of the Harvard men’s hockey team, was named the recipient of the 2016 Hobey Baker Memorial Award as the top player in college hockey on Friday evening during a ceremony in Tampa, Fla.
One year after finishing as a runner-up for the award, Vesey beat out Michigan freshman forward Kyle Connor and Boston College junior goaltender Thatcher Demko to become the fourth player in Harvard history to win the Hobey Baker.
In 33 games for the Crimson this year, Vesey logged 24 goals and 22 assists, placing him seventh in the country in points per game (1.39). He averaged 4.48 shots on goal per contest, good for fifth in the nation, and finished with five game-winning goals. 
In his acceptance speech, Vesey called winning the award a huge honor, but the senior spent the majority of his time on stage at the Tampa Theater delivering thank-yous to his family, coaches, and teammates. “No one wins an individual award without a supporting cast,” he told Wally Shaver of the Hobey Baker Award Committee.
Vesey had some special words for senior Kyle Criscuolo and junior Alexander Kerfoot in particular, with whom he has played on Harvard’s top line for each of the last two seasons.
"I’ve got a lot of the spotlight the last two years, and those guys took a back seat and never complained once,” Vesey said. “My teammates are my best friends, and I’ve had a great four years with those guys.”
The widely sought after NHL prospect had already accumulated plenty of hardware in recent weeks, including the Leonard Fowle Award as the New England Hockey Writers’ Most Valuable Player and the Walter Brown Award, given to the top American-born player in New England. Vesey was also named a First-Team East All-American by the American Collegiate Hockey Association on Friday and Player of the Year by both the Ivy League and the ECAC. 
But one individual award missing from Vesey’s trophy case was the Hobey Baker, which eluded him in 2015. Despite leading the nation in scoring with 32 goals, Vesey finished a runner-up, as the award was handed to then-Boston University freshman Jack Eichel, who led the NCAA with 71 points in his lone collegiate season before joining the Buffalo Sabres.
At the time, Eichel became just the second freshman to win the Hobey Baker in its 35-year history. Yet, most college hockey pundits predicted a rookie was going to receive the award for the second year in a row on Friday.
Connor, Michigan’s freshman scoring sensation, led the nation in goals (35) and points (71) in 38 games for the Wolverines while skating on the most productive line in college hockey. Connor’s linemates, juniors J.T. Compher and Tyler Motte, finished right on Connor’s heels with 63 and 56 points, good for second and third in the country, respectively.
Nonetheless, strength of schedule may have put the biggest dent in Connor’s chances. As a member of the Big Ten, Michigan plays each of the other five teams in its conference four times, and only two of those teams boasted overall records above .500. Meanwhile, eight of the 12 teams in the ECAC—Harvard’s conference—finished above the .500 mark, and all eight currently rank among the top 25 teams in the PairWise rankings.
The other member of the Hobey Hat Trick, Demko topped college hockey with 10 shutouts, recording a .935 save percentage, a 1.88 goals against average, and a 27-8-4 record in goal for the regular season champion of Hockey East—Boston College. Demko also had a hand in bringing the Crimson’s season to a halt, stopping 32 of 33 Harvard shots in BC's 4-1 win in the first round of the NCAA tournament on March 25.
With both their teams having been eliminated from the NCAA tournament, Demko and Connor have decisions to make this offseason regarding whether to return to school or sign professional contracts. Demko was selected by the Vancouver Canucks with the 36th overall pick in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, and Connor was selected 17th overall by the Winnipeg Jets in 2015. 
Vesey faced a similar situation last season when the Crimson was bounced from the NCAA tournament by Nebraska-Omaha, as the Nashville Predators were prepared to insert their prized 2012 draft selection into their lineup right away.
But Vesey ultimately chose to return to Harvard for his senior season—a decision that may have helped him secure some additional votes this time around. The Hobey Baker is said to value not only on-ice statistics, but character, sportsmanship, and scholastic achievement among other qualities embodied by the award’s namesake, a former Princeton star in the early 20th century.
“I know who my vote went to for Hobey,” said Rensselaer coach Seth Appert on March 12 after Vesey scored twice in a game that eliminated RPI from the ECAC playoffs. “I think [Vesey’s] the Hobey Baker winner. That’s how good I think he is.”
“We’re happy he’s going to graduate finally,” joked former St. Lawrence coach Greg Carvel a week later after the Crimson topped the Saints, 2-1, in the ECAC semifinals in Lake Placid, N.Y. 
Vesey joins Mark Fusco (1983), Scott Fusco (1986), and Lane MacDonald (1989) in Harvard’s club of Hobey Baker recipients. Harvard is the only team from either the Ivy League or the ECAC to have produced a Hobey Baker winner, and nationally, Minnesota Duluth is the only school that has produced more (five).
Meanwhile, Vesey also becomes the third consecutive Hobey Baker recipient to hail from one of the four Beanpot schools, as Eichel won the award in 2015 and Boston College’s Johnny Gaudreau, now a forward for the Calgary Flames, brought it home in 2014.
