After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard supported shareholder proposals calling on corporations to be more transparent about political contributions and internal environmental benchmarks, among other issues, according to a report on shareholder responsibility released Wednesday.
The University—which invests in companies across the globe—relies on the recommendations of two subcommittees of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, when voting as a stakeholder. In 2016, the committees reviewed 77 issues, nearly a third of which were related to corporate political contributions and lobbying expenditures, according to the report. They also considered proposals on corporate methane emissions, disparities in pay between men and women in the workplace, and private defense contracts in Israel.
An advisory committee—a 12-member panel of faculty, students, and alumni—first considers each proposal before presenting its recommendation to the Corporation committee, whose four members cast votes to determine Harvard’s position. In 2016, members of the Corporation committee included Corporation Senior Fellow William F. Lee ’72, University Treasurer Paul J. Finnegan ’75, Corporation member Nannerl O. Keohane, and Corporation member Jessica T. Mathews ’67. Harvard Law School professor Howell E. Jackson chaired the advisory committee.
For seventeen proposals calling on companies to commission reports on company lobbying—in sixteen cases direct lobbying, and in one case indirect—both committees voted in favor of all of the proposals, as they have in past years. The report notes that the volume of similar proposals has increased since the Supreme Court's ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which ended several restrictions on independent corporate political contributions.
On the environment, the committees abstained on seven of twenty-four proposals, sometimes deferring to policies established by the federal government. For a proposal on greenhouse gas emissions presented to energy giant Chevron, the Corporation committee voted to abstain from requesting the company adopt “long-term, quantitative, company-wide targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions” to limit global climate change to a warming of 2 degrees Celsius.
“Members remarked that by urging the company to adopt targets to reduce emissions from its products as well as its operations, the proposal, in effect, asks Chevron to reduce the scope of its business—an objective that could be seen as contradicting shareholder interests,” the report reads.
Another environmental proposal requested that Kinder Morgan—an energy infrastructure company dealing mostly in natural gas—release a report detailing ways the company is monitoring its level of methane emissions. The committees voted in favor of the proposal.
Resurfacing from 2015 was a proposal to Chevron that would require the company to report on its efforts to “minimize the adverse water resource and community impacts from the company's hydraulic fracturing operations.” The Corporation committee again voted in favor of the proposal.
The Corporation committee also voted to abstain on a proposal that called on PepsiCo to publish a report on steps the company might take to minimize impacts its insecticides have on bee colonies.
With concern rising over national opioid addiction rising, the committee saw a proposal this year calling for Johnson & Johnson, Abbvie, and Merck to compile a report on company policies for safe consumer disposal of prescription drugs. The committee abstained from voting on the proposal.
The Corporation committee did vote against proposals that asked Intel, General Electric, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, United Parcel Service and McDonald’s to adopt a “Holy Land Principle”—a set of guidelines designed to prevent employment discrimination against Palestinians in Israel.
Harvard did not support shareholder proposals calling on Boeing to divulge detailed information on its business relationship—namely its sale of weapons—with Israel, financial institutions to prohibit “golden parachutes,” or financial compensation, for executives departing for government positions. It abstained from voting on a proposal to compel Citigroup to prepare an internal report about its alleged gender pay gap.

In just a couple of days, winter break will be over—which means we’ll soon have responsibilities and classwork and busy schedules, oh my! We’re all about capitalizing on what little time is left and using it in the most important way possible, so we’ve put together a list of shows for you to binge watch just in time for the semester to begin. When classes start again, you’ll be totally up to date on classic oldies and all of the new shows making waves. Yes, you’re welcome.
Westworld
While you were spending all night at Lamont in the fall, all of your friends were probably watching HBO’s Westworld, a strange sci-fi western that’s been a hit with the critics. You only have a couple of days to catch up, but there’s only one season with 10 episodes so far, which is totally doable. HBO GO will definitely come in handy, along with Harvard’s VPN. Thank us later.
Sherlock
Everyone’s favorite neurotic British detective recently returned to TV with its fourth season. It’s about time you rewatched all three of the previous seasons, which only have three episodes each, and geared up for “The Final Problem.”
The Good Wife
You might be lowkey tired of political dramas because they're way too close to reality these days. We get that. Instead of one of the many White House shows (although we’ll always throw in a plug for the best of them all, The West Wing), try The Good Wife, a show centered around a lawyer whose life is turned upside-down when her State Attorney husband is arrested. Yes, we know it’s seven seasons long, but it’s all on Netflix, and we know you rewatched all of Gilmore Girls last semester in preparation for A Year in the Life.
The Crown
All aboard the hype train! Netflix’s most expensive show ever centers around Queen Elizabeth II and the early years of her reign. Unlike most period dramas, it’s a little less scandal and nudity, which is refreshing. It’s a cool way to revisit recent history, and it’s got some great acting. Besides, we’re all suckers for the mainstream.
Black Mirror
No binge list we ever made would be complete without this creepy sci-fi show. Each episode follows a different storyline and characters, so you don’t have to watch it in order or confront your crippling attachment issues. If you’ve been waiting for a show to blow your mind every single time you watch it, Black Mirror is the one for you.
The Get Down
While everyone was freaking out about Stranger Things, The Get Down went mostly unnoticed. That’s something we definitely need to change in 2017. Set in the Bronx in the ‘70s, The Get Down follows young people of color and their musical talents. Plus, it’s co-created by Baz Luhrmann, he of The Great Gatsby and Romeo + Juliet fame! How can you say no to this?
Veep
Maybe you aren’t tired of political shows just yet. HBO’s Veep is choke-on-your-food hilarious, following Vice President Selina Meyer and her many problems as she wrangles to keep a hold on the cutthroat DC political scene. It stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus (yes, the one from Seinfeld) and rakes in comedy awards almost every year. It’s a great way to forget about last year’s messy elections and laugh out loud.
