After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mayor Kim M. Janey has been rightfully lauded for breaking all sorts of barriers in Boston politics — most notably, and recently, being sworn in as the first woman and first Black mayor of Boston.
In a city as notorious for racism as it is for just about anything else, her spot at the top of City Hall is no small feat — and Janey has come to be about fixing it. She has taken it upon herself to dismantle her city’s reputation for injustice — not just through representation but also decisions and policy. Prominently displayed on the mayor’s website as the first item below her short bio is her flagship plan: Boston’s Movement to End Racism.
That this plan exists as the centerfold of any mayor’s platform is incredibly encouraging and speaks to the power of the Black Lives Matter movement this past year. Confronting racism has been on the back burner among Democratic politicians for decades, making Janey’s plans as refreshing as they are necessary.
But, Madam Mayor, your current plan to “end racism” is far from being as comprehensive as it needs to be.
At present, Janey’s pledges and actions are heavily centered on policing and healthcare. Reallocating 20 percent of the Boston Police Department’s overtime budget to investments in minority communities and signing an ordinance aimed at police accountability are meaningful first steps in these first few months. But they leave us far from the end.
For a plan to have any chance at “ending” racism, it must reach out further than this strictly two-pronged approach. Another important system demanding attention is Boston Public Schools.
Janey has dedicated her life to her deep care for the city’s youth and, separately, shared terrifying personal experiences of racist violence as an 11-year-old during school integration. Hence, it should come as no surprise to the mayor that racism runs deep in our school system. And while today’s students of color may not experience injustice as explicit as rocks being thrown at them, BPS still exposes them to undue risk of falling through the cracks due to systemic inequities.
To take just one instance: The adverse effects of exclusionary school discipline — punishments like suspension that take students out of the classroom — are well known. They have a solid link to the school-to-prison pipeline and educational development issues, familiar threats to communities of color. Compared to the rest of the nation, Boston has done a great job reducing the amount of exclusionary discipline used across the board. But when the data is broken down by race, it’s clear BPS is still failing racial minorities.
For the same, most common, and least egregious category of offense in the 2019-20 academic year, “non-drug, non-violent, or non-criminal related offenses,” white students were nearly six times less likely than their Black and Latinx peers to be suspended. Stated more potently, students of color are six times more likely to be exposed to all the lifelong negative consequences of missing classroom time than their white peers.
This alone should alarm and dishearten Mayor Janey and the superintendent of Boston Public Schools, Brenda Cassellius. They must take action to correct this system as an essential part of any “movement to end racism” in Boston.
For starters, they could use these data that they are already collecting to incentivize anti-racism in school evaluations. Currently, BPS’s “School Quality Framework” — the system used to evaluate and rank schools — only gives 10 percent weighting to a school’s “Family, Community, and Culture,” which includes how frequently students are punished. Additionally, this consideration of punishment is race-blind — so a school’s “culture” rating does not consider the disproportionate rate at which students of color are punished at present.
School evaluations could easily be changed to weigh a school’s culture more heavily and, within that culture, consider whether the staff is equitable in their use of punishments across demographic groups. This can create an anti-racist incentive for schools: Those fairer in their distribution of punishment for the same offenses receive higher evaluations, and vice versa.
But BPS should go even further than that. Researchers have shown that teachers are equally likely to believe that white and Black children should be punished for the first instance of a behavioral infraction. However, from the second infraction onwards, Black children become significantly more likely than white children to be punished for the same offense. Whether this bias is intentional or not is irrelevant compared to its impact on Black and brown students. Repeat recipients of punishment are labeled as “troublemakers” — a label impressionable students then feel inclined to embody — initiating a cycle of receiving more severe punishments over time, ending with students out of the classroom and in harm’s way.
BPS could increase accountability and begin collecting and publicizing the records of the rate at which various demographics of students receive repeat punishments at schools. Simply put, students and parents of color have a right to know if they or their child is likely to be subject to more unfair treatment over time. Teachers and principals ought to see if they are giving more punishments to certain kids over others. And, those individuals making conduct and discipline guidelines also ought to consider the realities of how equitably BPS teachers exercise their authority to punish students over time.
These steps are a small but necessary part of a much larger project required to “end racism” in Boston. They display that there’s ample room in education and other domains to incentivize anti-racism.
So, Mayor Janey, I implore you to be thorough and include BPS students in your current plans as mayor and in your campaign for a full term. It’s in line with both the city’s needs and your own goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, as troops were promised a retreat from our nation’s longest war, an entirely new conflict emerged – this time, a conflict of interest.
On April 16, the Washington Post caused uproar after failing to disclose a conflict of interest embedded in an op-ed it published criticizing President Joe Biden’s planned withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, co-authored by Harvard Kennedy School professor Meghan L. O’Sullivan. The sticking point? In addition to her professorial duties, O’Sullivan sits on the board of directors of Raytheon Technologies, a major U.S. defense contractor.
The implications of this association were immediately damning to some readers, who drew attention to the article, and likely negligible to others. What is clear, however, is that O’Sullivan’s ties to Raytheon are critical context necessitating disclosure in her author bio. Raytheon has a $145 million contract to train Afghan Air Force pilots and is a major supplier of weapons to the U.S. military. Raytheon’s CEO recently had to break to its investors that Biden canned a half-billion-dollar Saudi arms deal the company had inked with Trump. We can imagine the war in Afghanistan's ending inspiring a similar call. Here, a clear conflict of interest emerges.
Yet the Washington Post failed to include O’Sullivan’s position as a Raytheon board member in the author biography of her Afghanistan piece until controversy pushed the paper to four days after its publication.
There is no way for us to know who is responsible for this oversight, so, without details, we won’t be pointing fingers. However, if the Washington Post knew of this abundantly Google-able conflict, it should have included it in O’Sullivan’s bio, as is standard. Moreover, once the Post decided to disclose the conflict, it should have included an editor’s note highlighting that the change had been made. When a controversial element of a piece is changed online, this change must be noted and explained, not swept under the rug.
What we can say on the issue is that this problem isn’t going away anytime soon — nor should it. Companies want individuals with great expertise to serve on their boards, and academia and journalism are places where people cultivate specialized knowledge. Newspapers often publish op-eds from people who are closest to the events being dissected in their opinion pages, or from those well-studied in them. This isn’t only natural, but often desirable when it comes to bringing opinions to the table that are thoughtful and well-considered. Yet this web of an ecosystem makes opinion pages fertile ground for conflicts of interest.
In this particular instance, the Washington Post published an op-ed by O’Sullivan, an expert on international security, on an issue squarely in her domain of expertise. Should her seat on Raytheon’s board of directors – likely indicative of her excellence in the field – bar her from offering her own perspective on issues she is well-versed in? Of course not.
But while newspapers clearly cannot – and should not – seek to eschew all conflicts of interest, they must nonetheless always disclose them. This means cautiously working to unpack potentially corrupting sources of bias amongst contributors, and laying them out for readers to see. Doing this is requisite if readers are to believe opinion writing comes to them in good faith.
Newspapers must prioritize making readers feel like they are reading a piece that is intellectually honest with them. A way we’ve seen this done well is through injecting a “conflict” framing into a piece, so readers are fully aware of the nuance or perspective an author’s conflict of interest brings to a topic. A recent New York Times op-ed – “I Am the C.E.O. of Uber. Gig Workers Deserve Better.” – exemplifies this method of laying it all out on the table.
Meanwhile, back on the ranch, the Washington Post’s controversy has stirred reflection within our own writers’ room. We realize, most profoundly, that we have much to learn from the Post’s own oversights. Though, as a college paper, we deal less with opinion writers who head boards and come laden with compromising financial entanglements, our own conflict of interest procedures aren’t airtight. After some reflection, we’ve decided to begin strengthening, then rolling out, our own set of accessible op-ed disclosure and conflict of interest policies. We believe that nationally syndicated newspapers should introduce this practice too – yet as we patiently wait for such strides, we’ll stick to improving within.
Ultimately, every opinion piece will be driven by some level of personal bias – and even when newspaper boards are maximally vigilant in their efforts to scrub their pages of it, some biases that ought to be announced will inevitably fly under the radar. Against this backdrop, just as editors need to be diligent about conveying who exactly opinion contributors are, we as readers must understand that no single opinion piece should be treated as the end-all-be-all as we form and fortify our own opinions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Corporation voted last week to draw further from the endowment for fiscal year 2022 than initially planned due to strong stock market returns — a move administrators say will help Harvard’s schools as they cope with the second year of the coronavirus pandemic.
Harvard will now distribute 2.5 percent more in dollar value from the endowment than it did in fiscal year 2021, up from a planned 1 percent increase, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister announced in a Tuesday interview with the Harvard Gazette — a University-run publication.
Members of the Corporation — the University's highest governing body — initially voted on the 1 percent increase last fall. The exact payout rate — the percent of the market value of the endowment that is distributed — after factoring in the increase will not be known until the end of the fiscal year on June 30. Typically, Harvard’s endowment pays out roughly 5 percent of its value each year, covering about a third of the University’s operating expenses.
In a separate Tuesday interview with The Crimson, Hollister said the Corporation’s decision was made in large part because the stock market has recovered remarkably in the last year since the start of the pandemic, translating into a strong performance for the University’s endowment.
At the outset of the coronavirus crisis, experts predicted that market turmoil could pose a “grave” threat to Harvard’s finances. The University’s endowment nevertheless grew to a historic high of $41.9 billion at the close of the 2020 fiscal year.
“When the stock market does well, endowments, including Harvard’s, typically do well also and based on mid-year results, the trend looks — fingers crossed — pretty good, so the Corporation took this action of increasing the distribution for this coming year,” Hollister said. “It’s consistent with their intent of distributing as much as they responsibly can of the endowment to support all of the endowed research and teaching activities vital to Harvard’s mission.”
The Corporation’s move could bolster administrators, who will likely face two years of consecutively declining revenues for the first time since the Great Depression.
Hollister said that while the increased distribution will help with falling revenues, the decision was largely based on the endowment’s performance.
“The distribution decision is more related to the performance of the endowment than any other factor,” he said.
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a senior associate with the Institute for Higher Education Policy, commended the move, crediting the University’s financial planning to its ability to learn lessons from the 2007-08 global financial crisis.
“This modest increase is in keeping with Harvard’s long standing policy of prudence with regard to endowment spend down, a policy which has enabled it to survive numerous financial difficulties over centuries including its nearly fatal financial downturn as a result of the American Civil War,” Parker wrote in an email.
Parker added that he believes the University’s experiences in the 2008 recession should help its administration handle the losses in revenue.
“Harvard seems to have learned a lesson from the 2007-2009 meltdown and has had bad-case scenario planning in place for some time,” Parker wrote. “As a result, it should be better positioned than most to cope with the substantial losses in revenue which it and most other higher education institutions have suffered.”
Harvard has faced criticism in the past for its reluctance to draw further on endowment funds to cover its expenses. Last year, Harvard College Students for Bernie launched its #40BillionForWhat campaign, calling on the University to spend endowment funds on workers whose jobs were in jeopardy due to the pandemic.
Hollister maintained that the endowment is primarily made up of restricted assets that legally cannot be used for purposes other than those stipulated by donors.
“The ability to fund out of the endowment is a balance between trying to fund as much as possible and yet being responsible to the donors’ wishes,” Hollister said. “It’s not a big checking account that can be simply drawn down at will.”
Parker cautioned that the exact payout remains undetermined and market circumstances could change.
“Right now most institutions, including Harvard, are in a guessing game about how much and how fast revenues will increase as Covid recovery progresses. Until that picture is clearer, the 2.5% number probably represents a best estimate rather than a precise calculation,” Parker wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pregnant and postpartum women around the world reported high levels of loneliness, post-traumatic stress, and anxiety or depression during the Covid-19 pandemic in a Harvard School of Public Health study published last month.
The study reported results from an anonymous online survey sent out to nearly 7,000 pregnant and postpartum women from 64 countries between May and June 2020. Of all respondents, 53 percent reported loneliness, 43 percent reported elevated post-traumatic stress, and 31 percent reported experiencing anxiety or depression.
The researchers also found that 86 percent of surveyed women reported being somewhat or very worried about Covid-19. The most common worries were related to pregnancy and delivery.
The study’s senior author, Karestan C. Koenen, who is a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at HSPH, said in an interview that pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the changes in health care delivery caused by the pandemic.
“Pregnancy is a time when you’re going to the doctor a lot, even if you’re someone who never goes you’re going usually regularly, even if you have a totally normal pregnancy,” Koenen said. “We recognize that because of the distancing measures and the lockdowns that women were — that these sort of very normal aspects of pregnancy were — being radically affected.”
The researchers found that participants of the study reported distress at a higher rate than both women who were pregnant before the coronavirus pandemic and the general population during the health crisis.
The study also found an association with time spent checking the news and increased distress levels, explained Archana Basu, first author of the study and a research scientist in epidemiology at HSPH.
“We basically found that for people who checked the news from any source that was specific to the pandemic five or more times a day, that was associated with more than twice the odds of elevated post traumatic stress symptoms as well as anxiety and depression,” Basu said. “Excessive information seeking can in fact be associated with detrimental mental health symptoms.”
Elevated mental health concerns in pregnant and postpartum women were consistent across the countries surveyed.
“That was striking,” Koenen said. “I do a lot of global work and it’s very unusual you find the same thing at the same time.”
Harvard Medical School assistant professor of pediatrics Cindy H. Liu — who was not involved in the study — said she believes future studies should consider how the introduction of a vaccine against Covid-19 affects the mental health of pregnant women.
“There is still very little information about the mental health of women with the advent of vaccines,” Liu said. “I think the next step is to follow the mental health given the advancements of Covid and its recovery.”
Co-author of the study and HSPH professor of epidemiology Sonia Hernández-Díaz said she hopes to do follow-up research to the previous study — which was conducted in the summer of 2020 — that considers how new factors have affected maternal mental health during the current phase of the pandemic.
“I think the sources of potential anxiety and concern have changed,” Hernández-Díaz said. “I would love to have another similar survey maybe so they’re more targeted now, to see if anything has changed.”
Bizu Gelaye, a professor of psychiatric epidemiology at HSPH who was not involved in the study, said he hopes researchers continue to prioritize the study of women’s mental health once the pandemic ends.
“The fact that mental health has received greater attention during this pandemic and people start to talk about it is a good thing,” Gelaye said. “I hope that this attention that it is getting right now can continue beyond the pandemic so we can try to address perinatal mental health issues beyond the pandemic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Forum at the Harvard School of Public Health co-hosted a virtual panel Friday to discuss strategies for approaching the rise in racism, violence, and discrimination against Asian Americans in the United States.
The radio program The World jointly hosted the event, titled “Racism Against Asian Americans: Combatting Hate and Discrimination.” The World global health reporter and producer Elana Gordon moderated the panel, which featured San Francisco State University professor Russell M. Jeung, University of Massachusetts Boston professor Paul Y. Watanabe, president and CEO of the Asian and Pacific Islander American Health Forum Juliet K. Choi, and HSPH professor Howard K. Koh.
Jeung, who also co-founded the nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate, accused former U.S. president Donald J. Trump for stoking violence and racism against Asian Americans by using the term “Chinese virus” to refer to the novel coronavirus.
“It was deadly, because it racialized the virus and made a biological virus Chinese, and then stigmatized the people so that Chinese were the disease carriers, and immediately again Asians were targeted,” Jeung said.
Still, Choi said a bill addressing anti-Asian hate crimes — which the Senate passed on April 22 in a bipartisan 94 to 1 vote — was “a remarkable statement” and marked a “remarkable chapter” for American history.
“Now, the next shoe I am waiting to see dropped is how quickly will the House act and how strong will the bipartisan support be with this historical legislation,” Choi said. “As all Americans, we should support the proposition that xenophobia is not acceptable in our country and has no place in our American society.”
According to Koh, pervasive stereotypes that cast Asian Americans as a racial monolith can damage their ability to receive health care, especially during the pandemic. One recent study, Koh said, found that less than 0.2 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget was dedicated to AAPI health research.
“Clinicians must overcome their own implicit biases and avoid making any assumptions about an AAPI patient,” Koh said. “Don’t assume anything about their ethnicity, place of birth, languages spoken or not spoken, socioeconomic position, culture, spouse, sexual orientation, or worldview.”
Despite the fact that Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in the U.S., Watanabe said Asian Americans have long been seen as "other."
“We have been seen but not really seen, and the consequences of this is that when a group is invisible, they are often marginalized, they are often subject to prejudice,” Watanabe explained.
“There have been some dominant racializations and one of them is a notion of Asian Americans as perpetual foreigners,” he added.
To address racial animus against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Choi said she believes it is vital to dispel the model minority stereotype and include Asian American voices in government and in corporations.
“It’s that kind of individual dialogue with systemic recommendations where collectively we can — and we must — make progress,” Choi said.

The Harvard School of Public Health developed and ran a novel hybrid course this spring in which 16 instructors rotated teaching 3-hour lectures for a class of 34 first-year international students.
Last summer, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement barred international first-year students taking all-online course loads from remaining in the United States. Organized in response to these federal restrictions, HSPH’s new hybrid course ID 900: “Current Topics in Public Health” enabled international first-years at HSPH to learn in person and thereby live on campus this semester.
Nancy Turnbull, senior associate dean for educational programs at HSPH, wrote in an emailed statement that students in the ID 900 hybrid program are the only HSPH students taking courses with in-person instruction.
John Quackenbush, a professor at HSPH who taught in the hybrid course, said he “felt very safe and informed the entire time,” feelings he attributed to the school’s health and safety protocols. These included pre-screening surveys for involved students and faculty, onsite Covid-19 tests, and spacing between students and the instructor to allow for social distancing within the school’s Kresge cafeteria.
“And, of course, everybody wore masks throughout the entire process, including me as the instructor,” Quackenbush added. “I think that represents really everyone involved recognizing that adherence to these basic safety protocols are necessary, and they’re designed to protect all of us.”
HSPH instructor Erin K. Lake — who also taught the hybrid course — emphasized that every individual will have “unique and personal perspectives and approaches” to an in-person return.
“Not everyone will be anxious to return right away, for all matter of completely justified reasons,” Lake said. “This is a time, over upcoming months, where flexibility — and consideration of how uniquely each person experiences this process — seems paramount.”
Some international students who did want to come to campus this semester were not able to do so, though.
Apoorva Gomber, a MPH student in ID 900, said HSPH gave students a brief window to confirm their enrollment in the course. For some, the notice was too short to secure a visa in time.
“Some of my friends did not even get a visa because it was such a short span, I think less than 10 days, that we had to get everything done,” Gomber said.
“The prospect of taking courses at Harvard and interacting with students and faculty is a great thing to be able to do," HSPH professor Sebastien J. Haneuse said. "To be in this position where you’re not able to do it, it’s devastating for a lot of people."
Some students who were able to participate in the in-person class reported positive experiences.
Ana Lucia Rosado, another MPH student in ID 900, said she appreciated HSPH offering the hybrid program this spring for first-year international students.
“For me, at least, this hybrid program totally reframed my experience in a positive way and allowed me to see the full potential of the School, which is our colleagues and classmates and the professors, by interacting with them in-person,” she said.
Amrutha Denduluri, a MPH student in ID 900 from India, said that the ability to collaborate with a diverse group of classmates face-to-face was the “difference” that the hybrid class offered.
“The MPH program in itself is really short, so it’s difficult to meet outside class,” Denduluri said. “I really enjoyed being in class and seeing other students, and in the process, I actually made a couple of friends who I think will last with me for a long time.”
Kwabena F. Lartey, a student from Ghana, said he appreciated the ability to have a “semi-Harvard experience.”
“The sense of community of having people with the same challenges and experiences that you have — or similar to them — is helpful,” he said. “It’s that warm feeling of actually being with someone, that you’re not separated by a screen.”

UPDATED: May 3, 2021 at 3:10 p.m.
The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee virtually hosted its annual Israeli Apartheid Week, a series of events to raise awareness about the Israel-Palestine conflict, last week.
This year’s IAW included webinars titled “Healthcare Injustices in Palestine and the COVID-19 Pandemic” and “Palestine and the Progressive Agenda,” and featured panelists including Swarthmore College associate professor Sa’ed A. Atshan and Palestinian activist Yamila Hussein-Shannan.
Harvard’s Palestine Solidarity Committee is an undergraduate organization “dedicated to supporting the Palestinian struggle for self-determination, justice, and equality through raising awareness, advocacy, and non-violent resistance,” per its website.
Asmer Safi ’23-’24, a member of the group, wrote in an emailed statement that this year’s virtual IAW marked a “vital continuation” of the committee’s advocacy on campus prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Although the pandemic makes it difficult to be engaged with the causes that students were engaged with on campus, the social and economic impact of COVID-19 makes it more important than ever to advocate for marginalized communities across the world,” Safi wrote.
In 2019, IAW drew criticism from some Harvard affiliates who disapproved of the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s framing of the Israel-Palestine conflict.
IAW did not take place in 2020 due to the emerging global health crisis.
Safi wrote the Palestine Solidarity Committee “sees it as a central mission to make clear that its fight against Israel’s systemic, state-sponsored discrimination and apartheid policies not be conflated with anti-semitism.”
“Throughout IAW, PSC actively stood against any anti-semitic sentiment and made it a core part of its programming throughout the week to link the struggle for Palestinian rights with the struggle against anti-semitism,” Safi wrote.
Several student organizations co-sponsored the week’s events, including Phillips Brooks House Association, Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, and Jewish Coalition for Peace.
IAW attendee Shraddha Joshi ’24 said her involvement with the Palestine Solidarity Committee and academic interest in Palestine motivated her to attend three of last week’s events.
“If I’m studying the language and the culture that’s different from mine it’s so important to be educating myself,” she said. “IAW events were just a space to educate myself, to hear from some really incredible speakers who I’ve read from before but haven’t really had the opportunity to hear from in person.”
Joshi said she enjoyed last Monday’s event, “Divestment as a Historical Tool for Justice,” which she said focused on boycott and divestment.
“The idea of divestment and boycotting is something that we can do as consumers and as citizens, so I think it really helps to put in perspective how we can ethically engage with issues that are not just limited to Palestine,” she said. “Then also, how we as Harvard students can pressure our university or support efforts in our university to be more mindful of social justice.”

In a year full of uncertainties brought by the Covid-19 pandemic, juniors in the Class of 2022 hoping to pursue thesis-related research abroad have had to adjust their travel and thesis plans in accordance with public health guidelines and University travel restrictions.
Harvard first announced in April 2020 that it would temporarily prohibit all University-related non-essential domestic air and international travel, and later extended the ban indefinitely. In mid-August, administrators announced a petition process for faculty, postdoctoral fellows, doctoral students, and staff to travel for urgent or critical research, but a similar option was not available to undergraduates.
Such travel restrictions have pushed students writing theses to adapt in various ways — either finding ways to replicate their original research plans online or adjusting their research topics. In some cases, students postponed their academics altogether and took leaves of absence, hoping travel restrictions would be lifted by the time they returned.
In light of these changes, some departments — including Government and Social Studies — delayed thesis submission deadlines for this year’s graduating seniors.
For the first time in over a year, University-related domestic travel and travel to select countries rated low risk for Covid-19 will be allowed for fully vaccinated Harvard affiliates beginning May 15, the school announced Friday.
Many concentrators in social science disciplines whose theses relied almost entirely on information from research conducted abroad have decided to put a hold on their academic careers amidst the restrictions.
English and Social Anthropology concentrator Kalos K. Chu ’22-’23, a Crimson Arts chair, planned to spend the fall 2020 semester abroad at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, after which he would conduct a comparative ethnography on elite universities in the U.S. and China through his experiences there and at Harvard.
Chu wrote in an email that he learned in summer 2020 that he had been accepted to Tsinghua, which was essential to his original thesis plan, but it “didn’t really mean much” because Harvard had announced the suspension of all fall study abroad programs.
“I got where the administration was coming from; minimizing the spread of Covid-19 and keeping students safe is important,” he wrote. “Obviously, I was a little disappointed — especially considering how under control the pandemic was in China — but I understood their decision and ended up taking a gap year instead.”
Like Chu, History and Social Anthropology concentrator Waseem S. Nabulsi ’22-’23 was relying on traveling abroad to conduct field interviews for his thesis on regional Palestininan nationalism.
Nabulsi said he decided to take a year off because it would be “nearly impossible” to do any part of his project without travel to the Middle East.
He said he and other social science concentrators were concerned about maintaining the integrity and quality of their work if they adapted the projects to an online format.
“There’s sort of this internal dilemma of continuing to do your research, and making sure you’re on track to finish in a timely manner, and then also this fear of diluting your work,” Nabulsi said. “Sort of taking the original idea, diluting your original idea, and producing something that might not be of the same quality.”
“The benefit of taking the year off has been that I can put my plans and my research on pause until things open up,” he added. “But I know at the same time that a lot of other people don’t have that luxury and haven’t had that ability to take the year off.”
Zoe A. Eddy, the Anthropology department’s assistant director of undergraduate studies, said social anthropology concentrators like Chu and Nabulsi rely heavily on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews for their theses.
“Almost 100 percent of our thesis writers — regardless of number — 100 percent of our thesis writers do some sort of field work, whether they’re studying in another country, they’re studying in the U.S., or they’re working in an archive,” Eddy said. “We’re a bunch of anthropologists, many if not most of us work internationally and all of us travel for some part of our work.”
“[Ethnography] does involve this kind of tightly-knit, consistent, everyday interactions and observation in the space and like, obviously you can’t really get that with Zoom,” Eddy added.
Eddy noted that students have more limited timelines and funding to shift their research projects, so most of the thesis writers she is supervising have shifted to completely remote research.
Other students have found ways to adjust their research methods or topics as their travel plans were forced to change.
Justin Y. Tseng ’22, a joint concentrator in East Asian Studies and Social Studies, originally planned to conduct interviews and archival research in Taiwan, looking at how people in Taiwan view the U.S.-China power competition and the rise of China.
“It would be pretty interview-based, like trying to seek out interviews with regular everyday citizens on the ground and also some officials,” Tseng said. “I just had hoped to be able to talk to people.”
Tseng had intended to conduct these interviews in Chinese. He had also planned on going through archival documents from local governments about Taiwan and its history — most of which are physically located in Taiwan.
In response to the travel restrictions, Tseng had to cancel his trip. Though he said his transition to digital archival work has been relatively smooth, online interviews have posed an additional challenge.
“I might be able to reach out to people who are known writers or academics in schools and people in governments there, but I think it’d be quite difficult to conduct some more grassroots-type research,” Tseng said.
“One of my fears is that I won’t be able to get as many on-the-ground perspectives, and that I’ll have to rely more on American perspectives,” he added.
Kiara H. Gomez ’22, a joint concentrator in Government and Social Anthropology, was planning on conducting participant observation in New York City and then Paris or London for her thesis on labor organizing in the fashion industry.
“The part with Paris and London, that has to change, and I have to figure out some organization or some fashion council or an agency that’s based there that will let me work with them virtually, even if I’m in the United States,” Gomez said.
“I would have really liked to go,” Gomez said. “I’ve just been really looking forward to that with anthropology because participant observation is so crucial to the concentration.”
While several students expressed disappointment at having lost the opportunity to pursue research abroad, Gomez also mentioned that the digital transition has some silver linings.
“People have said, like from the previous concentrators from this year, that interacting with people has actually been a little bit easier, and getting more interviews has been easier, just because people don’t have to make the time to arrange for transportation and all these things,” Gomez said.
Students also noted that their respective departments have been accommodating and helpful with making the transition easier.
“I’ve talked with both the ADUSs for Gov and Social Anthro and they were helping me fix my proposal ideas or my thesis grants and things like that, and offering feedback to make sure that I could still do the research that I wanted to in a remote setting,” Gomez said.
Despite the various challenges, Eddy highlighted the persistence and flexibility of students — as well as the creative ways in which they’ve been transitioning their research.
“We haven’t had one person drop the thesis,” Eddy said. “One of the things about using digital spaces that they’ve done is really kind of tuning into how Zoom interviews work, and like what you can learn about people in a Zoom interview and trying to use the remote space like digital fieldwork.”
While students have made various adjustments to their research, faculty and advisors have also had to adapt resources and guidance for thesis writers.
Eddy said faculty in archeology, which typically relies heavily on in-person excavations, have tried to distribute resources as best they could, including dropping off dozens of books outside of students’ apartments in the Cambridge area.
Marcella “Sally” Hayes, a History Ph.D. candidate who organizes the Center for European Studies’s junior thesis workshop, wrote in an email that “every single thesis writer” who attended the workshop had to alter their plans in some way.
The workshop, according to Hayes, offered advice on various strategies for virtual thesis research — including locating existing scholarly networks and archives, using Zoom and international calling cards for interviews, and applying for remote research grants.
Eddy said the students she works with have been “incredibly resilient” in maintaining excitement and momentum for their research projects while also attending classes online.
“Those of us who are anthropologists with our doctorates were really resistant to start doing digital work, but our students got really, really creative,” Eddy said. “I think the students were able to kind of be more creative than the professors in some ways.”

Although the eight Ivy League schools boast diverse student bodies, each still has their own unique characteristics and identity. Thus, using a comprehensive Google search to analyze Harvard and its seven Ivy League siblings, Flyby presents the definitive list of Ivy League schools as email send offs.
Harvard – "Best,"
The email version of the infamous brag: “I go to a small liberal arts college outside of Boston.” While this send off doesn’t really mean that we are proclaiming our superiority in our email correspondence, it is a subtle way to remind people that Harvard students are the ~best~. ;)
Yale – "My Best,"
In an effort to one-up Harvard a la Veritas versus Veritas et Lux, you can expect Yale’s email send off to be similar to Harvard in a totally not suspicious at all way. Hence, instead of the simple “Best,”, it is now “My Best,”.
Princeton – "Sincerely Yours,"
It’s the classic email send off. While effective and professional, it’s also boring, preppy, and forgettable. Basically Princeton.
Columbia – "xoxo, Gossip Girl"
Enough said.
Brown – "Sending Good Vibes," or "Peace,"
The perfect email send off for the Hippie School of the Ivy League. Brown is known for being the chill and socially-conscious Ivy. Good vibes all around.
UPenn – "I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience."
This gives off business, professional, but also sliiiightly demanding vibes. Thus, it’s perfect for the heartless future Wall Street bankers from the Wharton School of Business.
Dartmouth – "Cheers,"
The only send off that truly captures the spirit of Keggy the Keg. Besides, considering Hanover’s location in the middle of nowhere, maybe this is how Dartmouth students stay happy: By constantly reminding themselves to “cheer up!” Or maybe they’re genuinely having a great time out in Somewhere, NH? The world may never know.
Cornell – "Sent from my iPhone"
Is “Sent from my iPhone” even an email send off? Anyways, it’s perfect for everyone’s favorite “Fake Ivy.”
Although often lumped together, all eight Ivy schools have unique vibes in their own right. We hope seeing them as different types of email send offs gives you a taste of what each school is truly all about!

Ahh, journals. The perfect place for pre-teen nostalgia of middle school crushes, high school teenage angst of hating everyone, college rants, vents, and emotional breakdowns. Be it a bullet, digital, or normal journal, journals are always there for you. Journaling die-hards (journal-hards??) promise it improves mental health and emotional stability, so I decided to try journaling for a week to see how it impacts my ~mental health~.
Pre-Journal Thoughts
I journal at irregular intervals, as a way to brain dump all the things racing through my mind, especially when I’m overwhelmed. With finals looming and the end of semester rush, my Gcal looks like a rainbow vomited all over it. In true overachiever fashion, I added another thing to my to-do list. However, my mental health is important so I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone — journal and write a Flyby piece about it. Because of course, nothing is real unless it goes on the internet.
Monday: 
After I snatched this idea off Flyby’s Monday slot, I knew I had to start right away. I have a basic black notebook I use to write to-do lists in, which I figured would do. It took me way longer than I’m willing to admit to find a pen that actually works. After I hunted down a pen, I sat down at 2:30 a.m. (so technically Tuesday, but whatever) to journal. Monday was a very long day for me, with last-minute cramming for my math midterm on Tuesday, writing Harvard Today, collecting data for my Psychology class project due on Saturday, a group meeting, and other stuff. So I quickly scribbled down some thoughts, rolled over, and promptly fell asleep.
Tuesday and Wednesday:
On Tuesday, I journaled immediately after my math midterm hoping that releasing all my stress on paper would help, and maybe I would discover why the exam made it seem like I’ve never attended a math class. I did feel much better afterward, but the fat four hour nap I took after probably helped.
Wednesday’s journalling sesh was filled with ~main character energy~. A bright sunny day, I dragged myself outside, made a little fruit salad and smoothie, and wrote away with my cat sleeping on the picnic blanket beside me. It was very quarantine picnic girl vibes and you know I had to take a picture for the gram to prove it.
Thursday and Friday
Thursday was a jam-packed day. With two classes, two sections, and one meeting, I was looking at a six hour Zoom day. In between my Gen Ed class and section, I journaled outside under the starry night sky. This may sound very sappy, but trust me!! Go out and stargaze tonight — you’ll feel all your anxieties floating away into space as you realize how insignificant we are in this vast universe. I felt so much lighter after journalling. I was energized and rejuvenated, and somehow I didn’t need six coffees to stay awake that day.
Saturday and Sunday
I stayed up all night on Saturday working on my Psychology paper, so by the time 6:59 a.m. East African Time (ie 11:59 EDT) rolled around, I simply could not look at any more words and I didn’t journal. After sleeping for 10 hours straight on Sunday, I treated myself to a vanilla iced latte (sigh, another coffee) at a cute little cafe, put on my favorite jazz lofi playlist and journaled for over an hour. This was truly the highlight of my week and I may have stayed there three more hours to watch the beautiful sunset go down.
After much reflection on my week, I can attest that journaling is amazing. I always thought I needed an aesthetic journal with AmandaRachLee vibes, but my little ole’ black notebook did pretty well. The catharsis that is word vomiting into a journal is unparalleled. Getting all the words, thoughts, and emotions off your chest actually feels like a burden being lifted. I definitely will continue to journal, not every day but as much as possible. Journaling gets a Flyby golden star of approval and we hope you try it out! All the best, and may your thoughts be filled with sunshine and puppies. Signing off, XOXO flyby girl ;)

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“A Legacy Revealed” is a podcast from The Harvard Crimson that dives into the roles that slavery and discrimination have played in shaping Harvard University over its 400 year-long history. Hosted by Raquel Coronell Uribe and Six Yu, this 6-part series invites experts from a variety of fields to answer some of the most compelling questions surrounding Harvard’s historical legacy, as well as its present day ramifications. This podcast is produced and edited by Lara Dada, Zing Gee, and Thomas Maisonneuve. Cover art by Madison Shirazi. Music by Dash Chin. Listen now on Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.
Episode 1
Cash-strapped in the 1700s, Harvard served as the first institutional bank in New England, handing out loans in a society that was heavily entwined with the Caribbean slave economy.
In our first episode, we explore the university’s ties slavery, answering questions like how many Harvard affiliates were slaveowners? In what ways did Harvard benefit financially from the Atlantic Slave Trade? And what happened on campus during the abolitionist movement?
Episode 2
In recent years, Harvard has faced increased pressure from activist groups to divest from the prison industrial complex. These calls come from the small percentage of the school’s $41.9 billion endowment that’s disclosed to the public. We look at the implications of prison divestment and why Harvard has yet to divest.
Episode 3
Louis Agassiz was a professor at Harvard University in the 19th century. He originally became famous for his work proving ice ages existed. But when he arrived to teach at Harvard, his work took a turn and he began promoting the idea of polygenism — a theory used to justify racism.
Episode 4
When Louis Agassiz was a professor at Harvard promoting the theory of polygenism, he commissioned a North Carolina daguerreotypist to take pictures of enslaved, African-born people. Almost 200 years later, Harvard still has these daguerreotypes in their museum archives.
Tamara Lanier says she is a descendant of Renty and Delia, two of the subjects of the daguerreotypes. She has sued Harvard, claiming she is the rightful owner of the images.
This is one of several ethical questions the Peabody has faced in recent years. We delve into the Lanier v. Harvard case, and we explore a letter the Association of American Indian Affairs sent Harvard, claiming they are inadequately complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.
Episode 5
In the early 20th century, Harvard boasted one of the highest undergraduate enrollment numbers of any university in the U.S. and England. This all changed after an influx of Jewish immigrants settled in Manhattan. What happened?
We delve into the antisemitic roots of the modern day admissions process.
Episode 6
In the final episode of A Legacy Revealed we delve into the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard lawsuit, which seeks to end race-conscious admissions at Harvard. The group alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process. Judges have sided with Harvard on two occasions, but now SFFA has filed the case with the Supreme Court. Now, the future of affirmative action might be at stake.
