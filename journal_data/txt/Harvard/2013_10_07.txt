After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
Every time I arrive at MIT’s campus, I think of the campus, with its modernist architecture and technological initiative, as a futuristic wonderland distinct both in approach and in style from Harvard’s Colonial Revival brick. This high-tech look and clean-cut architecture, coupled with the school’s emphasis on science and technology, makes it an unexpected place to find a weekend conference on the arts. Yet, on Sept. 28 and 29, MIT hosted its first  annual Hacking Arts event, a two-day conference of panels, start-up demos, live performances, art of every kind, and "hackathons"—marathon computer programing sessions in which participants got a hands-on opportunity to work with software. It was organized by a team of graduate and undergraduate students from Boston-area schools, with MIT Sloan School of Management students taking the lead.
I enter the MIT Media Lab at the heart of the school’s campus in the morning on the first day of the event. The first panel I attend is composed of a fascinating roster of people, from the CEO of Sonicbids—an online platform for bands, promoters, and agencies that makes the process of getting gigs and organizing regional and national tours much easier—to a YouTube Music representative who is presenting the advantages of customizable music content providers like Pandora and Spotify. In the representative’s view, these products attest to a larger societal phenomenon: the craze for having it "your way." 
The talk emphasized how in today’s media landscape, individual choices thrust us into different subsets of intersecting and separate media viewerships. While some of the attendees at the panel reminisced about the good old days of collective media experience—as one participant declared during the question and answer part of the same session, "I miss MTV!”—most people seem to be happy that the customizable future is here. 
Customization of cultural consumption via the internet was a dominant theme of dialogue and inquiry for the rest of the day. Entrepreneurs in music, fashion, performing and visual arts spoke of their endeavors to make independent, or at least non-mainstream, cultural agents more accessible to the general public. However, I also noted a scarcity of those traditionally defined as "creators" in the artistic field: artists. What the event did include was a broad range of entrepreneurs, programmers, and engineers.
Among the events that took place over the weekend was a panel on performing arts with Tod Machover, a composer and engineer who has done research on the intersection of technology and music, including music created by computers. He spoke of Media Lab’s creations, including the robot-assisted opera "Death and the Powers: A Robot Pageant." Composed and conceived of by Machover, who is also the director of MIT Media Lab's Hyperinstruments and Opera of the Future group, "Death and the Powers" is set in a hypothetical future in which it is possible to transform one's existence into a software system. It is not just the subject matter that is futuristic: human-scale sleek robots moving with complex choreographies begin and end the piece, while moveable backdrops constructed with screens visualize the tone and atmosphere of the score. 
In the same vein, a live mini-performance just before the Performing Arts session by two researchers from the MIT Media Lab, Peter Torpey and Elena Jessop, featured a prosthetic device in the shape of gloves that allows a storyteller to modify the sonic and visual components of her narrative with hand gestures. 
The diversity of participants at Hacking Arts called into question traditional definitions of "creating" in the 21st century. Kathleen Stetson '03, one of the co-chairs of the event from the MIT Sloan School of Management, says, "There's a momentum that is starting to build. For instance, Harvard...started the Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge last year. Same thing last year, there's a new 10k Creative Arts Challenge  as part of the MIT 100k here... Entrepreneurship centers are getting bigger,” Stetson says. The MIT 100k Entrepreneurship Competition is a competition in which aspiring entrepreneurs compete to win grant money for their pitch ideas.
Stetson says, “There's this movement towards, ‘Wait, we can create! I don't have to be an artist to create…. I can create in a lot of different ways!’ Why not get artist, musicians, filmmakers, entrepreneurs, and engineers together, and capitalize on that momentum?"  
As I left the building, the first stage of the hackathon was about to start with "ideastorms"—structured brainstorming sessions centered around themes like "democratizing the arts." 
 The next day was a full day of "hacking" during which teams publicly pitched their solutions to some of the challenges discussed at the panels. For the first time in my life, I got a behind-the-scenes look at how interdisciplinary crossroads like MIT are tailoring our futures and fostering creative thinkers who will have direct impacts on our lives in innumerable ways, through projects like the robotic opera and new softwares that capitalize on the intersection of arts and social media.
Stetson says, "The purpose of Hacking Arts is not just to talk about the future of arts and entertainment, but to create it." After all, my general impression of MIT was not just the cumulative of its stereotypical associations. The future was taking shape here, bolstered by a conversation launched at Hacking Arts among artists, businesspeople, and technological experts.

A play about a family feud and a lack of communication, “The Thing About Air Travel,” which ran through Saturday at the Loeb Ex, opened by focusing on the elephant in the room: a dog. Directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and supported by strong acting from all the players, the show explored the drama of dealing with death. With frequent moments of humor, the production provided adequate time to think about and appreciate the deep and well-expressed themes at work in this very entertaining performance.
In the show, a young woman, Marie (Maya M. Park ’16), is forced to fly home from Kenya when she gets an urgent call from her mom saying that her brother, Franklin (Bryan D. Kauder ’14), has died. Though coping with death can be complicated, the tragedy becomes particularly challenging when Marie sees her brother on the plane in the form of a dog. Limited to barking at one another, both struggle to express feelings of regret at the lack of communication that had existed between them while Franklin was alive.
The new play written by the young Max Posner, deals with an ironic aspect of the young adult generation—that a greater emphasis on globalization may actually make it easier for us to avoid each other. Marie, who always felt estranged from her mother, proves this theory true when she escapes her family ftroubles by moving to Kenya.
It takes an interaction with an unnamed older woman (Ema H. Horvath ’16) sitting next to Marie on the plane for her to begin to make strides toward greater communication with her family. Though the conversations begin awkwardly—with the old woman making statements such as "You have very nice breasts"—ultimately it is this strange situation that helps Marie to learn the barking language that Franklin uses and allows her to reconcile their previously lost relationship.
Throughout the play, clever and well-timed sound effects, designed by Brandt and Paris K. Y. Ellsworth ’15, helped to portray Marie’s inner thoughts. The story began and ended with vibrant African music ringing through the air, reflecting the happiness Marie found at her home abroad. During the troubling ride, though, frequently all sound was cut off, heightening the intensity of Marie’s internal struggle. Similarly, set designers Brandt and Daniel J. Prosky '16 drew attention to the main character’s personal struggle and isolation by using just two plane seats as the set pieces on a raised platform; since Marie is strapped into her seat and forced to sit for the entire airplane ride, she has no choice but to think about Franklin and her troubling relations back home.
Madeleine F. Bersin ’14 and Garrett C. Allen ’16 further illuminated the character interactions and family dynamics with their effective lighting design. Spotlights pointed out two distant figures on the side of the stage: the somewhat irrational mom and the humorous dad. Presenting those minor characters as present but separate from Marie on the plane ride set up an important contrast to the dead brother who repeatedly comes back to Marie.
“Air Travel” soared, thanks to a combination of great directing, effective sound design, and bold yet simple lighting that successfully conveyed the idea that communication is necessary for recovery from grief. The play came full circle and concluded by affirming this theme; the whirl of hallucinations, introspection, and intriguing conversations culminated in a beautiful scene where Marie and Franklin came together to produce a cathartic, canine howl.

I lost punch.
Of course, to lose a game, you have to play it in the first place (which is why I avoid beer pong at all costs). And punch is a game, after all.
Think about it. One must conduct oneself according to a carefully outlined set of rules, some spoken and some not. Take the dress code, for example—a guideline to which an aspiring club member must adhere as loyally as humanly possible. “No heels, please,” no problem, thanks. That’s an easy enough instruction to follow. But “casual chic” offers no clearer direction than would “nice clothes,” and an invitation that mandates “cocktail casual” attire would do just as well—and just as oxymoronically—to require that hopefuls arrive in “ballroom sleepwear.” Add explicit requirements like these to a host of implicit dos and don’ts (do smile until your cheeks hurt, don’t mention that you write for The Crimson), and you have your parameters of play.
Then there’s the competition. And this isn’t a soccer match: This is cross-country. Not just because it takes as much endurance to girl-flirt for an hour straight as it does to pound through eight kilometers of hill and dale, but also because your teammates aren’t just teammates; they’re rivals, too. That’s not to say that your friends will stick their legs out to force you off the course and into a ditch with a twisted ankle. But their winning does not necessarily lead to your winning. No one player carries the team on her back. Each runner alone puts one foot in front of the other to reach the finish line. And when you earn a medal, it means someone else does not.
So punch is a game, and I joined in. I pulled back my arm and took a swing. I missed by a mile, and I felt sad. That’s one of the problems with punch, of course: It can introduce or reinforce the idea that a select group of older Harvardians may determine a select group of younger ones’ worth. Final clubs also will never shed their air of elitism, a vestige of the notorious Old Boys’ Club Harvard of yore, even though they now can boast substantial racial and socio-economic diversity.
It’s dangerous to punch thinking that success translates into grabbing the highest stone on a social rock wall or that failure signifies the first step toward pariahdom. It’s also dangerous to punch thinking that you must change your behavior or disguise your background in deference to the imaginary refined, blue-blooded punch powers that be. But if you punch knowing that a final club would be just one added dimension to your life at Harvard, just something you want to join because why not, then who’s to tell you you’re in the wrong? No, we should not be ashamed of lacking wealth, of appearing uncultured, of any of our mannerisms or traditions. But we also should not be ashamed of seeking to belong to something.
Belonging is as fundamental a human desire as food and shelter. We find belonging in a host of places: In our blocking groups, our relationships, our sports teams, our newspapers and literary magazines and theater troupes and service groups and fraternities and sororities and, you guessed it, final clubs. Perhaps the forces of racism, sexism, and exclusivity can permeate the final club scene, and perhaps some club members do feel superior to the masses that line up at their doors. But that doesn’t mean that most sophomores who choose to punch do so to foster a great schism between the haves and have-nots. We punch to belong, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Thankfully, Harvard presents enough opportunities for belonging that final clubs do not even come close to ensuring or endangering student happiness. That’s why the disappointment of losing punch, while sharp at first, fades away with time and a few tea lattes. I did not—do not—think I am better than punch, and I also do not think punch is better than me. Punch is just punch, nothing more and nothing less. None of us needs it. But neither should any of us feel guilty for wanting it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I'm a non-smoking, 45-year-long tax-paying resident of Cambridge, currently living in the Cambridge Housing Authority’s Putnam Apartment complex for the elderly and/or disabled, and I've just read with incredible pride last week’s editorial in your paper.
Because of a bout with cancer some years ago which decimated my savings, I found myself in the scary position of needing—for the first time in my adult life—financial help from others for housing, because there is not enough low-income housing available in our city.
I was raised to accept responsibility for my own financial needs and I not only did manage to do this all of my life, but after leaving Harvard I also started a non-profit music production company which supported me and provided employment for many others. I paid all of my federal and state taxes this entire time. It is these taxes that contributed to the CHA support for the same housing of which I now find myself in need.
To say I was grateful that CHA housing existed and that I was eligible to apply for a unit is a massive understatement.  Without this I would have been on the street.  But it was not just the provision of housing that meant so very much to me—it was the unexpected respect and real courtesy from the entire CHA staff that removed any sense of disgrace, any sense of being a second-class citizen, that I may have felt asking for this help.
Then, in June of this year, I received a "Notice of Proposed Lease Amendment" from the CHA informing me of a proposed change to my lease—the addition of a requirement that I accept a "Smoke-Free" policy as a part of my lease or face eviction.  My response was genuine shock.
I have never been able to make enough money to buy my own house, but I have always felt "equal" here in Cambridge—that I was truly contributing to this diverse society which did not determine the value of its citizenry based on their financial status.  And until receiving this proposed "smoking ban" notice I had never felt demeaned by anyone in Cambridge due to my financial situation—not even once.
Now I Do feel, because of my low income (and age, which limits my ability to attend the "discussion" meetings held during the summer due to the intense humidity and heat) that I really am a "second-class" citizen,and it is an awful feeling.
I personally no longer smoke but my brother (who is my only living relative and only regular visitor) does—and among other concerns, I worry that I will lose the comfort and support he has provided, a scenario which would cause me great distress. And I cannot avoid feeling that being told that my guests or I cannot smoke if we wish to in my own home is both a frightening invasion of my (and other CHA tenants') privacy—and a monumental infraction of our basic civil rights.  Further, I cannot help but feel that this smoking ban is a truly opportunistic discrimination the poor and elderly.

To the editors,
I am writing in response to Sandra Korn’s column published on Wednesday, September 25th titled “Sexual Politics.”  The author highlights the role of student organizations—“especially those with extensive off-campus space”—in contributing to rape culture on campus. In particular, she used a painful incident from the Advocate’s recent history to illustrate the potentially dangerous power vested in student organizations and exploited during comp. As publisher of the Advocate and a peer educator for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, I am grateful for the sincere urgency with which Korn has approached this set of common challenges. I am disappointed, however, by Korn’s defeatist conclusion.
Alexander J. B. Wells ’13 and Hana Bajramovic ’13, two Advocate members, proposed an OSAPR Student Organization Liaison program after a bystander intervention training at the Advocate last fall was met with great success. The proposal was motivated by a realization that OSAPR could have a powerful impact in the less formal domains of campus life.
OSAPR officially announced this program in a document circulated among student leaders last May. The document, written by the OSAPR staff, cited academic research indicating that socially active student organizations are uniquely poised to shape and reshape campus norms. The program will teach Student Organization Liaisons practical tools for creating safer social spaces on campus, in addition to encouraging cultural shifts in their organizations. The liaisons will serve as “role models of new attitudes and behaviors which will increase bystander intervention and decrease peer support for interpersonal violence.”
While history may run deep in student organizations at Harvard, social traditions ebb and flow with each new administration. Community culture is malleable: institutional memory in our organizations lasts three years at most. We all—and especially student leaders—have a personal responsibility to take an active role in changing institutionalized attitudes around sexual assault. With a few vigilant leaders in each organization heightening awareness and supporting survivors, we can create accountability as a community at large.
Korn and I spoke earlier this week about specific obstacles we have faced in our organizations. We have decided to continue the dialogue in an open forum about sex, politics, and power in student organizations two weeks from now. We hope to be joined by other concerned students because change necessarily starts with hard questions—and action must answer them.

Higher education reform has long been one of President Obama’s major priorities and it is one in which there is much work to be done, in particular to address the issue of rapidly rising costs.  As part of an effort to deliver on his promises, Obama has proposed, among other things, to tie federal student financial aid to metrics such as colleges’ graduation rates, net tuition levels, and graduate debt and income.  However, while Obama’s intentions may be good, his proposal would restrict choices for students who need federal aid and exacerbate their financial difficulties.
Tying financial aid to college ratings would coerce many students to choose colleges based on government-determined ratings.  Using money as leverage, the federal government would reward students at highly-ranked schools and effectively penalize students for attending a lower-ranked institution instead.  This would make it harder for students to attend institutions where, for instance, a large proportion of graduates enter into lower-paying fields like education or public service compared to schools focused on engineering or business.  As University President Drew G. Faust argued, such a narrow approach to reform is “misguided.”
This program also threatens to devolve into a vicious cycle of funding reductions, reminiscent of the highly controversial No Child Left Behind Act.  Colleges that perform well in the considered criteria would receive more federal grants and more affordable loans.  In essence, schools that are already doing well would become even better off.  As Vice President Joe Biden said regarding this policy, “You’re safe at Harvard.”  Meanwhile, colleges that rank poorly would lose funding, making it even harder for them to finance their educational mission, leading in turn to even worse outcomes.  Instead of helping to improve lagging schools and increase the value they provide to their students, Obama’s proposal would simply reinforce existing disparities.
Moreover, the burden of this policy would only fall on students who need financial aid.  Wealthy families in essence would not be affected—their children would still be able to make college decisions freely regardless of how the government distributes federal aid.  On the other hand, students who rely on such aid to attend college would be pressured even more to make decisions between schools because of financial concerns.  These students may find that colleges they want to attend are now unaffordable because of a lack of federal aid for those colleges under this policy.  Students receiving aid who already attend such colleges may face even more difficult financial circumstances as the money dries up.
Certainly, millions of families care about information such as college costs, debt, and future earnings.  By itself, a publicly available resource like Obama’s online “college scorecard” with such comparative data is highly beneficial, allowing families to make more informed decisions about their children’s educations.  However, forcing students’ financial aid to depend on this data is not.  Such a policy is fraught with inequities and unwelcome coercion, harming the very people it is meant to help.

Twenty years ago, on October 19, 1993, the US House of Representatives voted 264 to 159 to reject further financing for the Superconducting Super Collider, the particle accelerator being built under Texas. The government had already spent $2 billion on the Collider, and its estimated total cost had grown from $4.4 billion to $11 billion; a budget saving of $9 billion beckoned.  Later that month President Clinton signed the bill officially terminating the project.
This was not good news for two of my Harvard roommates, Ph.D. students in theoretical physics. Seeing the academic job market for physicists collapsing around them, they both found employment at a large investment bank in New York in the nascent field of quantitative finance. Their assertion that derivative markets, whatever in fact they were, seemed mathematically challenging catalyzed my own move to Wall Street from an academic career.
This cohort of Ph.D.s in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (the STEM disciplines) sparked a remarkable growth in the sophistication and complexity of quantitative finance. They built models which enabled banks and hedge funds to price and trade complex financial instruments called derivatives, contracts whose values derive from the levels of other financial variables, such as the price of the Japanese Yen or a collection of mortgages on apartments in Florida. A brand new career path was created, that of financial engineer or quantitative analyst (“quant”), a vocation that became so popular—for its monetary rewards certainly, but also for its dynamism and innovation—that by June 2008, according to the Office of Career Services, 28 percent of graduating Harvard seniors going into full time employment were heading to finance.
However, just as some investors in 2007-2008 were questioning the inexorable rise in house prices and the potential for a market bubble, so too were many students questioning their own career choices, sensing the possibility of a career bubble. As President Drew Faust said in her first address to the senior class in June 2008, “You repeatedly asked me: Why are so many of us going to Wall Street?”
Three months later, both market and career bubbles collapsed as Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.  In the midst of the financial crisis, on October 3, 2008, the House of Representatives voted 263 to 171 to pass the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, authorizing the Treasury secretary to spend $700 billion—roughly 65 Super Colliders—to purchase distressed assets.
What went wrong? While the causes of the financial crisis have been widely debated, it is clear that many financial engineers were caught in what I have termed the “quant delusion,” an over-confidence in and over-reliance on mathematical models.  The edifice of quantitative finance built over fifteen by the “SSC generation” years was dramatically rocked by the events of 2008. Fundamental logical arguments that practitioners had taken for granted were shown not to hold. Decades of modeling advances were revealed to be invalid or thrown into question.
It is hard to prove a direct causal link between the cancellation of the SSC, the rise of financial engineering, and the chaos of 2008.  However, if some roots of the financial crisis can be traced, however distantly, to October 1993, might one consequence of the financial crisis itself be a healthy reassessment of career choices amongst our brightest graduates?
I encounter evolving attitudes among students in my class Statistics 123: “Applied Quantitative Finance.” While some still plan a future on Wall Street and are motivated by the mathematical challenges and dynamic environment ahead of them, many appreciate that they have a broad range of equally compelling career options, whether in technology, life sciences, public health, climate science, or fundamental research. So, as we experience a rebalancing of an economy that was over-levered to the financial industry, a similar rebalancing is occurring with career choices, in particular amongst graduates in STEM disciplines. For example, according to The Crimson senior survey, the number of Harvard graduates pursuing a finance career fell below 10 percent in 2012.
One can still see the abandoned buildings of the Super Collider near Waxahachie, Texas. The Lehman Brothers tower, meanwhile, on Seventh Avenue in New York, has been renamed and rebranded with Barclays blue. And in July 2012, 19 years after the cancellation of the SSC, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva reported the discovery of the Higgs Boson, a landmark for the academic physics community. Perhaps one legacy of the financial crisis will be that we see the emergence of an “LHC generation,” a cohort of quantitative graduates engaging in fundamental science.

Education advocates could not reach a consensus on whether online courses can solve rising inequality in higher education during a panel organized by the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers on Friday.
The panelists consisted of Susan M. Dynarski ’87, an education professor at the University of Michigan, and Jeffrey R. Young, a current editor and writer for The Chronicle of Higher Education and a current Nieman Foundation fellow. During the event, Dynarski and Young discussed the challenges facing higher education.
According to Dynarski, the differences in both college matriculation and retention rates between income brackets have risen significantly in the last few decades.
Throughout the panel, however, the discussion shifted from educational inequality  more broadly to whether online education could offer a possible solution to this issue.
Young said there has been a trend in higher education to turn to massive open online courses as an alternative or supplement to the traditional classroom.
He said EdX, the online platform founded by MIT and Harvard that offers free online courses, was an example of an attempt to make world-class education available to all through technology.
However, Dynarski said online education courses alone could not transform higher education.
“The word ‘MOOCs’ is the flavor of the day, but it allows us to be distracted from the problem of educating kids,” Dynarski said, referring to the acronym for massive open online courses. “It is one more tool in the toolbox.”
Though Young said there is a risk of overemphasizing technology as the solution, he also said that online platforms still have a role in the future of higher education.
“I think what will end up sticking around is a hybrid model,” Young said. “But there is a risk in replacing automation for some students but not others.”
Amanda Haziz-Ginsberg, a 2012 graduate of the Harvard Divinity School and a staff assistant with campus services, said she thought the panel raised interesting questions about how technology and higher education interact.
“These questions are becoming increasingly important, giving the rising costs of college,” Haziz-Ginsberg said.
The panel was part of a fall series organized by HUCTW to commemorate the union’s 25th anniversary.
“For our 25th anniversary, we wanted to celebrate by providing a joint opportunity for the entire community to learn together and to talk about issues affecting our members—issues like the middle class, health, and higher education,” Emily Hankle, a HUCTW organizer, said.

In the first cycle since the Harvard Law Review incorporated gender-based affirmative action into its admissions process, 17 out of 46 editors are women, nearly double last year’s 9 female members of 44 overall.
The 128th volume boasts more women on its staff than any board since volume 122 was selected in 2007.
In the admissions process, interested candidates participate in a writing competition consisting of a ‘subcite’ component, which involves correcting errors in a short written piece and a commentary section in which applicants report and analyze a recent case before the United States Supreme Court. This week-long process takes place after the completion of first-year final exams in the spring semester.
This year, the Law Review received 267 applicants, a “somewhat higher” number than past years, according to President Gillian S. Grossman ’10, a third-year student at the Law School.
Of this pool of candidates, 20 editors were admitted based solely on their writing competition scores and 14 were selected based on a combination of their first-year grades and writing competition scores. Gender was not considered in evaluating the candidacy of any of these 34 applicants.
Ten newly selected editors underwent the Law Review’s updated discretionary process. These ten spots are filled based on the review of a discretionary committee that assesses applicants’ grades, writing test scores, race, physical disabilities, and for the first time ever this year, gender.
The policy change, which was instituted in January, is intended to “enhance the diversity of the editorial body,” Grossman told The Crimson at the time.
Grossman declined to comment on whether the shift in the admissions process was a success. However, it is unclear whether the increase in female editors is due to the new affirmative action policy or if more women were selected by chance using the gender-blind processes.
This change comes amid increased activism at the Law School over the place of women. A newly established organization called “Shatter the Ceiling” has raised issues with the number of female faculty, women’s participation in the classroom, and female representation in organizations such as the Law Review that impact job prospects after graduation.
A second major initiative, an expansion of the Law Review’s membership from 44 to 46 editors, was approved concurrently by second-year editors last winter alongside the expansion of the journal’s affirmative action policy. For the most recently selected volume, two editors who had been admitted in previous cycles deferred due to their enrollment in joint-degree programs.
In addition to publishing the Law Review, the new volume will be involved in redesigning the journal’s website which Grossman hopes to launch by February 2014.

On a boat cruise last month, sophomores in Pforzheimer House got the chance to mingle not only with other members of their class but also with two new residents of Pfoho—House Masters Anne Harrington ’82, a history of science professor, and her husband John R. Durant.
“I think we felt a bit like sophomores ourselves,” Durant said in an interview last week in their Masters’ residence on Linnaean Street.
Like the sophomores who reside in their House, Harrington and Durant are also spending their first semester getting to know Pfoho.
Harrington and Durant were chosen in the spring to serve as House Masters following the announcement that then-Masters Nicholas A. Christakis  and Erika L. Christakis ’86 would depart for Yale at the end of the 2013 academic year. Harrington, the director of undergraduate studies in the history of science department, and Durant, an adjunct professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also lead a Harvard Summer School program in Cambridge, England.
Just about a month after the start of the semester, the pair—along with their 9-year-old son, Jamie—reflected on their time in the House thus far, weeks they described as both hectic and rewarding.
“Quite honestly, it seemed like a lot longer, because so much has happened in a month,” Durant said.
“It’s the longest September I can remember,” Harrington added.
Since arriving, the new Masters say they have been working to get to know the House, its staff, and the undergraduates who reside there, while also maintaining House traditions and instituting some of their own.
In addition to hosting open houses for students, Harrington and Durant, who hails from England and graduated from the University of Cambridge, have planned a series of Saturday morning English breakfasts for Pfoho residents. The first one was held on Sept. 28.
Pfoho residents said that they have appreciated Harrington and Durant’s efforts to make Pfohosers, as they call themselves, feel welcome. Sebastian G. Devora ’15, a member of Pfoho’s House Committee, praised Harrington and Durant’s interactions with HoCo.
“I really like the way they are approaching us,” Devora said. “They are working really hard to reach out to the students.”
The family expressed satisfaction with their time in the House. For his part, Jamie said that living in Pfoho is “half really hard and half really fun.” Jamie said that, while there is always something for him to do at Pfoho—like play ping pong and X-Box and do homework—it’s also hard because others in the House “are always trying to meet you and ask you questions.”
Harrington and Durant also said they were happy with their new jobs.
“I think it’s wonderful,” Harrington said. “I think we’re really enjoying it, and we feel very welcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Queer Advisory Council, an offshoot of the Harvard Office of BGLTQ Student Life, held its inaugural meeting Saturday afternoon. The group, which is composed of one representative member from each of the eight BGLTQ-identified student groups on campus and five at-large members selected from the undergraduate community, aims to facilitate discussion about BGLTQ issues on campus and allocate funding to student organizations.
Kevin D. Tervala, graduate intern for BGLTQ Student Life and advisor to the QuAC, said that the group’s aim is to “fully represent the needs of students,” and explained that a key function of the council will be awarding money to student organizations that apply for grants through the BGLTQ Student Life office.
The QuAC will meet every month, and although its 13 voting members are the only representatives with the power to allot funding, the meetings are open to all members of the Harvard community.
Tervala started the meeting with an overview of the formation of the QuAC, and introduced attendees to the primary roles of the group which, in addition to funding, include advising the Office of BGLTQ Student Life on BGLTQ issues and serving as a forum for the BGLTQ-identified student groups.
“How you’re going to fill [these charges] is still up for debate,” said Tervala, adding that he wanted the QuAC to form a game plan for the rest of this year and end the meeting with a list of “actionable items.”
During a brainstorming session, attendees discussed a variety of ideas, from organizing discussion forums to using the QuAC to connect with the greater Boston BGLTQ community. Other ideas included establishing targeted advocacy for issues such as gender-neutral housing and creating spaces to discuss queer issues on an ad hoc basis.
The attendees collectively decided that the QuAC should first gather student voices to create a narrative of the issues most pertinent to Harvard’s BGLTQ community through the organization of a town hall-style forum.

As the government shutdown enters its second week, students at the College and the graduate schools say that the closure of government-run websites has negatively impacted their ability to do research and classwork and expressed concern for family members affected by the furlough of federal workers.
Lawmakers in Congress failed to pass a budget agreement by October 1 after weeks of heated debate over the implementation of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, leading to the furlough of almost a million federal workers and the closure of national parks and museums across the country.
For students, the suspension of federally maintained websites has been the most visible effect of the current shutdown.
“The Library of Congress website has been down, and that has impacted my research for my thesis,” said Alexandra M. Slaight ’14, a history and literature concentrator. “It’s stalling my project.”
Students in Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning 22: “Nutrition and Health: Myths, Paradigms, and Science” have been unable to complete a recent problem set requiring students to track their diets using the United States Department of Agriculture website.
“Unfortunately, ever since the shutdown, the USDA website for the nutrient tracker has also been down,” said head teaching fellow Audrey J. Gaskins. “I had no idea that [the shutdown] was going to affect me in this way.”
Graduate students have faced issues due to website disconnection over the course of their research.
“On Wednesday I was working on some research for my dissertation, and I went on the Census website and wasn’t expecting it but found that the website had been shut down,” government Ph.D. candidate Stephen Pettigrew said.
Other students have been forced to stop “non-essential” activities as a result of the shutdown.
“The panda cam at the D.C. Zoo is shut down, and watching the panda cam is a good study break,” Emily M. Bishai ’17 said, referring to cameras that live-stream the pandas at the National Zoo.
Many members of the Harvard community also expressed worry for relatives employed by the federal government, which furloughed 800,000 workers on Tuesday.
“My aunt is essential government personnel, so she’s at work right now and not getting paid, and my uncle is non-essential government personnel, so he is not going to work and not getting paid,” Henry A. Shull ’13-’14 said. “It’s difficult for their family.”
Some students expressed frustration with the lack of bipartisanship in Washington right now and expressed hope that politicians will reach an agreement soon.
“[The shutdown] speaks to the level of polarization in Congress right now,” Pettigrew said. “The differences between the parties are pretty broad and don’t leave much room in the middle for compromise.”
“We are hoping things will get resolved and the government will be back up and running,” said Gaskins, a former employee at the National Institutes of Health.
The current fiscal impasse began when Senate Democrats refused to pass a last-minute agreement drafted by House Republicans that would have extended the government budget while delaying funding for the Affordable Care Act for another year.
“What’s going on is a game of chicken,” Law School professor Robert H. Mnookin said. “Each side is saying ‘We have demands that must be met, or we’re going to go over the fiscal cliff.’”
The next looming fiscal deadline is October 17th, at which point the government must pass a budget or face automatic cuts of $742 billion to offset the current budget deficit.

As social science Ph.D. candidates set to complete their programs in 2014 prepare to enter the job market, several Harvard affiliates said that securing social science positions in academia is now easier than it has been since the start of the economic recession, particularly for graduating Harvard Ph.D.s. And although they voiced concerns about a still-competitive job market that they say is made even more compact by current nationwide trends towards reducing tenure-track positions, they say these cuts have not significantly impacted Harvard job seekers.
“[The job market] might have bounced back a bit, but it’s still seriously competitive, and I think it’s going to remain that way for some time, especially if you’re talking in particular about research,” said Kenneth J.D. Allen, a third-year graduate student in the psychology department.
Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, an associate of the economics department who will assume an assistant professor position in 2014, said that the market is “back to being sort of a steady pace,” after acknowledging that the financial crisis had set back hiring for both public and private schools.
Data on job placement rates for recent Ph.D.s at Harvard and nationwide is hard to come by. Most signs indicate, however, that Harvard Ph.D.s are finding jobs—some Harvard social science departments post lists of recent graduate students’ job placements, and Harvard has placed at or near the top in a number of recent rankings of graduate school programs’ Ph.D. placement rates.
“The level of panic that I’ve seen has actually decreased a little bit in the last year or two, at least among my fellow students in the government department,” said Colin M. Brown, a Ph.D. candidate.
But while hiring generally is slowly getting back on track, multiple Harvard social scientists expressed concern that hiring for tenured positions might not be.
“There have been attempts by universities to essentially cut costs and have a more flexible labor force which means for various reasons that they don’t want to always use tenure-track appointments,” said Arthur P. Spirling, an associate professor in the government department. “And there has been quite a lot of discussion in the academe about this kind of movement with many people generally disapproving of it.”
Allen agreed that the increase in non-tenured track positions, including at Harvard, came from the need to be cost-effective.
“They have to meet the needs of their students using non-tenured faculty, which is troubling for graduate students,” he said. “It’s a scary thing.”
According to Margaret T. Frye, a postdoctoral fellow in the sociology department who will cover an assistant professor position at Princeton next academic year, this trend of favoring non-tenure-track hires over tenure-track hires has created a shortage of “the kinds of jobs that are ideal to conduct research.”
According to Spirling, however, Harvard has consistently been able to place its political science Ph.D. graduates in a tenure-track career.
“Whether it will play out the same way for everyone in the quality scale of academia I don’t know, and my sense is that these trends of hiring more and more non-tenure track faculty will continue,” he said.
According to Frye, another reason why social science Ph.D.s struggle to find employment is that they do not receive enough financial support from their institutions. Frye added, however, that Harvard seems to be doing a better job than other universities in supporting its social science Ph.D. candidates.
“My sense is that in terms of financial support for graduate students, Harvard is able to support its students quite well, but the broader issue is that there are just…not that many jobs,” she said.
The competitiveness of the job market is also causing an increasing number of social science graduate students to search for employment outside of academia, social scientists said.
Benjamin Golub, a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows who will become an assistant professor of economics at Harvard in 2015, said that the effects of the recession have altered the type of careers that Ph.D. candidates decide to pursue.
“Mostly [recessions] change the outside options, they change where people would go,” he said. “If consulting firms and finance firms are hiring less, as they do in a recession, then it really makes it more competitive at every level.”
“Some [political science] graduates go off to fulfill roles like data scientists for places like Facebook and Google,” Spirling said. “So those with quantitative skills that they built up during their Ph.D. process have generally found it relatively straightforward to find non-academic employment.”
Brown said that skills like statistical analysis, theoretical development, and modeling, give social science PhDs. an advantage in finding employment in the private sector, particularly in government and business analysis.

Undergraduate Council members welcomed foreign visitors at Sunday’s general meeting as representatives from Chinese student governments came to draw lessons from the student governments of Harvard and other Ivy League universities.
The delegation, which consisted of eight student body presidents from top universities across China and two leaders from the All-China Students’ Federation—the body that represents all of the country’s university student governments—sat by quietly as UC representatives discussed topics ranging from student grant funding to the finalization of internal UC committee positions.
The Ivy Council, an organization made up of the student government leaders of the eight American Ivy League institutions, organized the visit as part of its Ivy-China U.S. Invitational Exchange initiative. The program consists of students from Ivy League universities traveling to China and students from Chinese student governments traveling to the United States at different points throughout the year.
According to C.C. Gong ’15, Currier House representative and Ivy Council vice president of external affairs, the Chinese delegation visited Brown University over the weekend and will visit Columbia later this week.
“To them its a great learning opportunity,” said Gong, who is an inactive Crimson editor.
Speaking through a translator in an interview after the meeting, a student leader in the All-China Students’ Federation said he was particularly impressed by “three features” of the UC: its transparency regarding money and funding, the equal opportunity for all members to speak at meetings, and the high-efficiency with which the meeting was run.
These features make the UC different from student governments in China, where, he said, leaders often speak for the entirety of meetings, preventing general membership from having a say.
But, he added, the fact that the Chinese government directly sponsors student leadership groups provides them with some advantages not found in the United States. Because of the setup, student governments have broadened access to technological resources and enjoy the benefit of certain decisions being carried out more swiftly and effectively than they would have without government sponsorship.
In addition to hosting the Chinese delegates, the UC unanimously approved the year’s first round of grants during the meeting, divvying out more than $24,000 in funding for events hosted by more than 50 student groups on campus.

As investors continue to voice concerns over emerging market growth in Asia, Governor of the Bank of Thailand Prasarn Trairatvorakul emphasized the importance of strong political institutions in coping with today's economic challenges in a lecture Monday afternoon at the Harvard Kennedy School. 
Earlier this year, expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would begin tapering its monthly bond purchases sent rounds of shock waves across emerging markets around the world. Trairatvorakul suggested that for Asian economies, the more critical long-term challenges are not external, but internal.
“In order to facilitate sustainable growth, governments in Asia have to find ways to achieve efficient resource allocation and create trust and confidence in the public,” Trairatvorakul, a graduate of Harvard Business School, said in an interview with The Crimson.
Trairatvorakul said that the strength and quality of domestic institutions are the most important factors in determining the Asian economies’ capabilities of transitioning to a more diverse and sophisticated model of growth. He compared institution-building to a soccer game.
“There are many moving parts at the same time, the play is unpredictable, and it involves an enormous amount of tacit unseen coordination among players,” Trairatvorakul said.
During the lecture, Trairatvorakul identified a number of institutional features conducive to economic growth, including macroeconomic stability, rule of law, good education, and low levels of corruption. Trairatvorakul called on emerging markets to seize the opportunity to introduce structural reforms and challenge “vested interests” in order to strengthen their political and economic frameworks.
In addition to institutional-building, Trairatvorakul discussed the concept of central bank independence at yesterday’s talk.
“We should be wary of using the term independence because independence has different meanings in different contexts for different people,” Trairatvorakul said in response to a Business School student who asked about whether past decisions made by the Bank of Thailand were affected by political considerations.
“It would be naive to think that the central bank here is completely independent of the U.S. government,” he added.
Trairatvorakul said that the elected government should be involved in determining the targets and objectives of monetary policy, but “timing, strategy, and other technicalities” should be independently decided by the central bank.
“The central bank has to be the neutral party that takes away the punch bowl when everyone else is drinking,” Trairatvorakul said.

A recent study from Harvard’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering has uncovered features of the genetic code that may end a long-standing controversy in molecular biology and revolutionize the way many drugs and biofuels are currently produced.
For a decade, scientists have struggled to understand how codons--specific letter sequences of nucleotides that represent amino acids--dictate protein production.
“A lot of things that appear trivial in genetic coding…are not very well understood,” said Harvard Medical School professor Daniel B. Goodman, a co-author of the study.
Researchers have offered theories to explain why certain codons allow for greater protein production than others. The “codon ramp hypothesis” attributes high protein production to the slowing down of the ribosomes that make proteins. The idea holds that codons at the beginning of genes act like a ramp on a highway in slowing down ribosomes that might otherwise crash into each other.
According to the Wyss Institute researchers, this hypothesis does not accurately explain the role of codons.
“It is the DNA itself—the structure—that [is] driving the difference [in protein production] and not the codons that the DNA is made into,” Goodman said.
Goodman’s team, which also included Harvard genetics professor George M. Church and Wyss Institute scientist Sriram Kosuri, separated the effect of rare codons from structural differences within the cell. Through the use of advanced sequencing technology, the researchers found that DNA bases with weaker structures are more conducive to protein production due to their decreased folding.
While the Wyss researchers did find that rare codons increase protein production 10 to 15 fold, their experiment showed that when the cell’s ribosome “highway” is empty, which should allow for faster production according to the “ramp” hypothesis, there is no difference in production.
The results, published in Science, have important implications for biotechnology, medicine, and culinary science, Goodman said. Researchers may now be able to optimize protein production by simply altering certain features at the beginning of a gene.
The researchers hope to extend their study to examine related issues such as the role of codons in other parts of the gene and the effects of environmental conditions on gene production.
For now, Goodman said that he is glad that the team’s research has contributed to “finally resolving” a mystery of protein production.

The overall crime rates in Cambridge have fallen 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2013 compared to last year, but the number of violent crimes has increased by 18 percent between August and September 2013, according to a monthly report from the Cambridge Police Department.
The report also identified a high concentration of bicycle theft in Harvard Square.
 
Of the 33 total violent crime incidents in September, 12 were robberies and 19 were aggravated assault, which represent increases of 20 and 27 percent, respectively, compared to August.
 
“It is common to see increases in these types of crimes between August and September as students are returning to school, and there are a larger number of people in the city,” said CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello in an emailed statement to The Crimson. 
 
In the last week of September, six violent street robberies were reported throughout Cambridge, primarily occurring between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m.
“Street robberies at this time of year have been a persistent seasonal problem for a decade, with new students arriving in the city and, possibly, with the release of new cell phone technology around this time period for the past several years,” Riviello wrote.
 
Compiling and mapping data from each reported robbery in the Cambridge area, CPD also identified patterns in the locations where these crimes have occurred. Among the 306 bicycles that were stolen in the first nine months of 2013, CPD reported the highest concentration of bicycle thefts were  in Harvard Square. The department noted that most of these bicycles were secured to bicycle racks or poles and stolen in the daylight hours.
 
Despite the increase in incidences of violent crime in September, the total crime rates in Cambridge dropped by 9 percent in the first three quarters of 2013 as compared to the same time frame in 2012.
When compared to a weighted average of the past five years, the crime rate in the first three quarters of 2013 has decreased by 10 percent.
 
The report attributed the reduction in overall crime rates in part to a 28 percent decrease in burglary rates as compared to those of last year as well as to a 35 percent decrease in commercial burglary from the weighted average of the past five years’ rates.

More than 40 years after the Star Wars saga's debut, Harvard physics professor Mikhail Lukin and MIT physics professor Vladan Vuletić say that they are closer to making the film’s iconic lightsaber a reality.
 
Lukin, Vuletić, and their research group at the Harvard-MIT Center for Ultracold Atoms conducted an experiment, which involved firing photons through a cloud of matter cooled to a temperature near absolute zero.
The researchers found that these elementary particles of light could be manipulated into acting as if they had mass.
Because the experiment shows that mass-like interactions between photons are possible, it suggests the possibility that lightsabers–the colliding beams of light wielded by the Jedi and the Sith alike in the “Star Wars” franchise–might one day expand beyond the realm of science fiction.
“The experiment is not a completely crazy image of how you would build a light saber,” said Thibault Peyronel, an MIT Ph.D. candidate who worked on the project. “[The experiment] opens the imagination to the idea that light is not just the simple particles that we usually think about and that if we are clever enough about it we can modify its properties.”
 
Vuletić said that the theoretical developments necessary for the experiment only came about within the last decade. 
“This type of photonic bound state has been discussed theoretically for quite a while, but until now it hadn't been observed,” said Lukin in the paper’s press release.
The researchers expect their findings will have far less fantastic, but much-more pragmatic, applications.
While modern computers store information in electronic bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers employ quantum bits. These can exist in a superposition of both 0 and 1, which allows for faster and more efficient computing. Based on the experiment, those quantum bits might one day make the use of photons to store this information more efficiently.
“Photons are a good candidate [for quantum bits] because they can travel fast and transfer information over long distances,” Peyronel said.
Without photon interaction, Peyronel said, there is no way to change the information stored on a quantum logic gate--the basis for quantum circuits where the output is based on a small number of quantum bits.
He added that the team’s findings might also be used to improve infrared thermometers, which  can measure fundamental constants in physics to a very high precision, as well as for thinking about new states of matter in general.

Three weeks ago, co-captain James Leakos led the Harvard men’s cross country team in a rout of Yale at the annual Harvard-Yale dual meet. The senior cruised to a first place victory, leading the race from start to finish.
This weekend, the Crimson competed at the Paul Short Invitational, which was hosted by Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Penn. Despite running on a different course against a larger field with tougher competition, it was the same result for Leakos, who finished in first place out of the 397 competitors at the meet. The senior covered the 8k course in 23:13, clocking in with a blistering pace of 4:21 per mile.
American University’s Mike Biwott battled with Leakos for the top spot for most of the race.
“Biwott took off to the front pretty quickly, and was the one setting the pace for a good amount of the race,” Leakos said. “I wasn’t in an intolerable amount of pain, so I starting pushing him a little, and threw down with a mile out to put it away.”
In the Paul Short meet’s 40-year history, only one runner has bested Leakos’ time from Saturday: Liberty University’s Samuel Chelanga, who wo n the NCAA Men’s Cross Country Championship in 2009 and holds the NCAA track and field record in the 10,000-meter run.
“It’s fun to hear myself mentioned in the same breath as a runner like Chelanga, but otherwise I’m just happy to have run well against the field,” Leakos said. “It’s certainly good to see that I can race at the level of my training.”
“It was one of the more impressive performances I’ve seen as a coach,” said Crimson coach Jason Saretsky. “[Leakos] has been working hard, and you can see that he’s approaching training with a new mentality.”
Overall, the Harvard men finished in fourth place out of 47 teams at the meet with a total of 167 points. Indiana University, which was ranked No. 15 in the country in the latest USTFCCCA poll, earned first place with 89 points. Dartmouth upset No. 20 Georgetown, 106-110, to round out the top three.
Crimson co-captain Maksim Korolev, who has typically been the men’s team’s other front-runner, finished in 12th place with a time of 24:13—exactly one minute slower than Leakos. Korolev was just a second shy of finishing in the top-10 at the meet.
“Maks wasn’t really racing [at the Paul Short meet],” Leakos said. “He was just working out, and helping some of the guys along to faster times. When he was told to ‘go’ with 800 [meters] left, he passed around 30 guys to finish 12th and put 30 seconds on the people he was with. He’s in nasty shape.”
Junior Will Geiken was the Crimson’s third finisher, averaging five-minute miles for a final time of 24:47 and 44th place. Behind Geiken were classmate Lukas Gemar and sophomore Tom Purnell, who were separated by just three seconds and crossed the finish line in 53rd and 58th place, respectively.
“I thought the meet went really well,” Saretsky said. “I was really pleased with how both the men and women competed. We had some strong showings, and it was a good stepping stone along the road that is our season.”
On the women’s side, Harvard finished in seventh place in the 47-team field. Senior Emily Reese led the way for the Crimson women, taking home 12th place with a 6k time of 20:42. Junior Viviana Hanley crossed the finish line three seconds after Reese in 14th place.
Sixth-ranked Georgetown won the meet on the women’s side with 112 points, and Dartmouth, led by four-time track and field national champion Abbey D’Agostino, who won the race, finished in second. The Crimson’s 221 points earned it seventh place at the meet, also behind Ancient Eight rivals Cornell and Columbia, who finished in fourth and fifth place, respectively.
Captain Morgan Kelly, junior Jen Guidera, and freshman Sarah Gillespie rounded out the scoring five for the Harvard women.

The Harvard women’s soccer team will look to do something that no other team has been able to do thus far this season: score against Boston University at Nickerson Field.
The Crimson (6-3-1, 2-0-0 Ivy) will face perhaps its toughest opponent on Tuesday night, as it heads across the river to play the Terriers (8-3-1, 3-1-0 Patriot) in its final non-conference match-up.
Harvard has been hot lately, winning six straight games, but will face a rolling Boston University squad that has won six of its last seven contests.
The Terriers have held opponents to 0.42 goals a game on the season. Something will have to give Tuesday night, however, as the Crimson’s offense is averaging an impressive two goals per contest.
It will be up to star freshmen forwards Midge Purce and Karly Zlatic to break through Boston University’s ironclad defense, as the freshmen look to continue their strong starts to the season.
“The freshman class as a whole has added a lot and contributed a lot both on the field and off the bench,” co-captain Peyton Johnson said. “Midge and Karly have shown a lot of experience in putting away their goals as they did this weekend against Yale.”
Purce leads Harvard with 13 points on the year and scored a late goal against Yale on Saturday. Her score silenced the Bulldog crowd, clinching yet another Ivy League win for the Crimson, 3-1.
“I think that the freshmen are getting even more confident as the year goes on, putting them in an even better position to contribute for us,” Johnson said.
Meanwhile, Zlatic was named the Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week, the conference announced Monday. Zlatic posted the game-winner against Yale, giving her six points on the season.
“Everyone contributes in such different ways to the team,” Purce said. “Everyone’s role is equally important and we all make it easier on each other to succeed.”
The role of Harvard’s defense has been another key to the team’s success thus far. The Crimson is allowing a mere 0.78 goals, with three goalkeepers, freshman Lizzie Durack, junior Bethany Kanten, and junior Cheta Emba all seeing equal action in net.
Harvard’s defense has even sparked much of its potent offense, with freshman Bailey Gary and sophomore Alika Keene making significant contributions.
“We are going to play to the best of our abilities and leave everything that we have out on the field,” Purce said. “That’s the expectation every time we step onto the field.”
While the Crimson’s keepers haven’t seen much action this season, Tuesday should prove to be much different. The Terriers are led by senior forward Madison Clemens, who is a dynamic force up-front. The preseason Patriot League Offensive Player of the Year recently netted two goals against Holy Cross in a 3-0 victory.
But Clemens, whose performance earned her Patriot League Offensive Player of the Week, isn’t the only player that Harvard will have to worry about.
Boston University features its own freshman phenom, Erica Kosienski. Kosienski is a three time Patriot League Rookie of the Week and has already scored three game-winning goals this year.
In a contest that is destined to showcase much offensive firepower from both sides, Harvard has remained more focused on its own play, rather than that of the Terriers.
“I think that we are largely going to try and work on ourselves,” Johnson said. “Our objectives and mentality are going to be focusing on our own goals and our own strengths and trying to hone those going forward in the season.”
Though the Crimson hasn’t beaten Boston University since a 1-0 win in double overtime in 2007, the team is focused on approaching Tuesday nights contest like any other.
“It is largely just going to be a game like any other soccer game,” said Johnson. “We are going to take a chance today to look at video from this weekend and think about what we need to work on better and take care of business and give a full effort.”
Harvard will put its win streak on the line, as the seniors get one final chance to down the Terriers before they graduate. While the game has no effect on its Ancient Eight record, a win would carry a lot of momentum heading into match-up at Cornell on Oct. 12.
“At this point in the season, every win you can get is a huge one and this will be no different,” Johnson said. “I hope that we can come out with a lot of emotion, just as we brought this weekend and continue that going towards our game tomorrow night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, the Harvard women’s rugby team came away with its first win against Brown in roughly a decade. Although the Bears have commanded the rivalry in the past, this year a different Brown dominated the game.
Crimson co-captain Xanni Brown led her squad with 37 of its 57 points, more than quintupling the seven points that her Providence opponents scored in the entire match.
“It was awesome,” fellow co-captain Brandy Machado said. “Whenever we were near the sidelines, she was there, fighting really hard to score. I was a little bit worried that we wouldn’t be able to hold the lead, but Xanni proved me wrong every single time she scored.”
Brown made sure that Harvard had nothing to worry about on the offensive side of the ball, scoring five tries and adding six conversions in the team’s victory. Although Brown was the top scorer of the game, she attributed her success to the ability to work well with her teammates.
“I thought game management went really well for me this week,” Brown said. “Making sure I was communicating and [making sure I was] on the same page as all my teammates so that we were executing the game plan created a lot of opportunities for me.”
The fact that Brown outscored the entire opposing team may seem like an anomaly to some, but it does not come as a shock to co-captain Ali Haber.
“In general, I’m not surprised when she outscores the other team,” Haber said. “We were really excited to beat Brown because that hasn’t happened in a really long time. [Saturday] was extra exciting because Xanni’s play was phenomenal.”
Phenomenal play is something that has been the standard for Brown throughout the rugby team’s inaugural season as a varsity sport. She leads the Crimson with nine tries on the year and has scored at least one try in all four of the team’s regular season contests, including Harvard’s only score in last weekend’s 10-5 loss at Dartmouth.
Because the Bears have proved to be such a dominant opponent in the past, the Crimson entered the game with extra motivation to prove it belonged in varsity level competition, and Brown stepped up her individual game as well.
“Because we were playing much better as a team, some of those tries she scored [were the result of] a pass right before the try-zone because we were actually playing together,” Haber said. “There was a lot more team play, and she was the aggression at the end that got the ball into the try-zone, but there was a lot of help along the way.”
Being a co-captain of a varsity team may put Brown in the spotlight, but that is a role she willingly steps into. Brown noted that the team has put a lot of effort into elevating its status to a varsity sport. She believes that the squad’s performance in this inaugural season will set the tone for the program.
“There’s pressure [to succeed], but in a good way,” Brown said. “It’s been really surprising to me to see how many people are paying attention to the fact that we’ve made this transition…It’s really exciting to be a part of something that people around here are watching.”
Perhaps surprisingly, this season marks only Brown’s fourth year playing the sport. Entering college with no prior rugby experience, Brown was encouraged by the older members of the team to try rugby as a freshman, and she has not looked back since.
“The girls who were seniors when I was a freshman and led the team to a national championship had a great impact on me,” Brown said. “Now that I am playing that role this year, I try to embody their on-field skill and their leadership off the field.”
Brown’s leadership outside of game play is something that her teammates greatly commend. Being the anchor of the squad both on and off the field allows Brown to showcase her athletic ability while encouraging her teammates to push themselves to improve their play, as well.
“Xanni has always been a leader on the field, but now she is also putting in work as captain, so she is mentally leading the team, as well,” Haber said. “She was a star this week, as always.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Results were varied this weekend as the Harvard Sailing team split its crew to compete in four regattas. A triumphant performance on home waters was overshadowed by challenging conditions that put the Crimson low in the finishing order in an intersectional regatta hosted by the Coast Guard.
CHARLES RIVER INVITATIONAL
In its strongest performance of the weekend, Harvard hosted 11 colleges in an in-conference regatta of FJ racing. The Crimson came out on top in first and third with the combined efforts of eight sailors, five of whom were freshmen.
“Overall this was a pretty fun regatta,” junior Ansel Duff said. “It was a good opportunity to get underclassmen competing and it went really well.”
Although the weather was some of the best that Harvard faced all weekend, Duff noted the complexity that often comes from the Charles course.
“We were very cognizant of what was happening with the wind,” he said. “Especially on the Charles, conditions can be tricky and the wind can be shifty and inconsistent with velocity and direction.”
The Crimson finished just 17 points ahead of second-place Boston University. Room for improvement, Duff commented, can definitely be found in boat handling. Sophomore Daniel Leichus, who competed in the B division, agreed.
“We’re still a young team, so we’re putting a lot of work into improving our tactics,” he said.
ROSS TROPHY
Fourteen teams from eight colleges came together at the Charlestown Naval Yard and competed in the ninth annual Richard B. Ross Memorial College Bowl in the Boston Harbor. Harvard landed in 13th place, its lowest finish of the weekend.
This promotional regatta involved only one division and the competition was with Rhodes boats. Senior Caitlin Watson accompanied classmate Ames Lyman for a majority of the regatta, while sophomore Adam Brodheim paired with Lyman for one rotation. The Crimson did not place higher than 11th in any of its races.
Tufts University came out on top with a sophomore duo that finished in the top 10 in all five rotations.
SMITH TROPHY
MIT hosted the George Warren Smith Trophy on the Charles in which it finished second behind Tufts and just ahead of Boston College.
Harvard took seventh place with freshman Bennett Capozzi and sophomore Kristina Jakobson in the A division and rookies William Bloxham and Olivia Kjorlien in the B division.
The wind was relatively weak throughout the day until about one PM, when a steady wind from the east came in and six races in each division were conducted.
DANMARK TROPHY
Poor sailing conditions seemed to be what hurt the Crimson the most this weekend as it came in 12th place in the Danmark Trophy hosted by the Coast Guard.
Finishing in 16th place in the A division were junior Gram Slattery, sophomores Andrew Mollerus and Sydney Karnovsky, and freshman Julia Lord. Junior Brian Drumm and sophomore Jacob Bradt took 10th in the B division. There were 20 schools represented.
Saturday saw several races postponed due to the light wind but conditions changed and racing commenced later in the afternoon, only to face strong currents that challenged boat control. Dying wind and stronger ebbs of the water defined Sunday’s racing, limiting the total amount of competitions that took place.
“The conditions were very tough,” Bradt said.  “We were put in conditions we were not really used to and the light air with a lot of current really alters your game plan in nearly every part.”
Bradt expressed that the team was more comfortable in transitions on Sunday than Saturday, despite the fact that the strong current had the greatest impact on the starts for Harvard on Sunday.
Bradt felt that the team’s expectations were not met.
“This weekend showed us that we need to practice more in those conditions,” Bradt said. “This also means that we’re not at the place where we can go out consistently.”
Reflecting on the improvements that need to be made in the weeks to come, Duff stated that technical skills and smart boat-handling tactics are high priorities.
“The relationship we have between our skippers and crews is something that we will continue to foster throughout he year,” he said.
Duff believes that the team will find more improvement when it develops its teamwork on and off the water.
“It’s hard to be in a boat with somebody all day and not get along with them,” he said. “Finding who we work well with, developing that relationship, and pushing it forward is going to play a key part in our success.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Tennessee Titans’ starting quarterback Jake Locker sidelined with a hip injury, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 made his first start of the season in Sunday’s contest against the Kansas City Chiefs. Despite leading a second-half comeback, Fitzpatrick threw a costly interception in the fourth quarter that crippled Tennessee’s chances at victory, and the Titans fell to the undefeated Chiefs, 26-17.
Fitzpatrick connected with running back Chris Johnson on a 49-yard pass to begin the scoring for Tennessee less than three minutes into the third quarter, narrowing the deficit, 13-7. After Titan field goal, Fitzpatrick scrambled for a nine-yard touchdown to lead the team to a third straight scoring drive, giving Tennessee their first lead of the game, 17-13.
Fitzpatrick was unable to respond to Kansas City’s 13 point fourth quarter. Chief cornerback Quintin Demps picked off Fitzpatrick twice with less than six minutes left, both of which led to Kansas City field goals.
The former Crimson star overcame a rough start against the Chiefs in the first half, only completing five passes for 31 yards. The team was held scoreless in the first 30 minutes.
Fitzpatrick finished as the leading passer and rusher for Tennessee on Sunday, throwing for 247 yards and adding 50 yards on the ground.
With Locker likely to be sidelined for the next few weeks, it looks as if Fitzpatrick will continue to lead the 3-2 Titans in the immediate future.

Tuesday night, I stumbled upon a goldmine of procrastination when I discovered that Miley Cyrus’ new album "Bangerz" was streaming free on iTunes Radio. However, as some of you may actually need to focus on your Gov 20 reading, it’s understandable that you may not want to devote an hour of your time to Miley’s chef d’oeuvre. Luckily for you, I’ve compiled a cheat sheet of Miley’s most thought-provoking lyrics along with what paltry analysis a non-English major can provide.
1. “All the way in the back, with a tree on my lap / All the boys like to ask me, what you doing with that / If you say you love me, I ain't fooling with that / They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack” – “SMS (Bangerz),” featuring Britney Spears
Here, Miley lends a touch of mystery to what seems to be a generic “partying in the club” lyric with her unconventional word choice. What is the “tree” on her lap? Most trees are of the size that won’t fit in a lap, so barring the possibility that Miley has an affinity for bonsai bushes, I must conclude that the “tree” is a) metaphorical or b) a drug reference. According to the Urban Dictionary, “tree” is parent-friendly slang for the drug marijuana. Given that Miley owns a dog named Mary Jane, this explanation is a viable possibility, yet it still remains to be determined why one would have a tree (joint?) in one’s lap. So I venture that this tree is in fact a metaphor for something deeper, her soul perhaps (is she a vegetarian?). Bonus points to anyone who can explain the significance of the “battery pack,” or what the title of the song, “SMS (Bangerz)” means.
2. “I'm a female rebel can't you tell? / Bang on the dashboard, just chipped a nail / Lean out the window that's when I yell / Driving so fast 'bout to piss on myself… / Police want to get him and put him in jail / Imma do whatever to get him his bail / Hooked on donuts and [inaudible]” – “4x4,” featuring Nelly.
In this country-hip-hop crossover jam, Miley’s imagery takes a turn for the literal. Little interpretation is needed. Yet the last phrase seems somehow unrelated to the previous few, and its inaudible ending is frustrating, like the unresolved ending to a French arthouse film. Is it possible that the obfuscated word has implications that will utterly revolutionize our interpretation of the song? Having cross-referenced several sources, the only hypotheses for the missing lyric were “roof satin” (LyricsTranslate) and “pussy tails” (AZ Lyrics). Unfortunately, the world may never know what Miley was intending, but at least we know that next to trees and molly, her favorite drug is donuts.
3. “You think I'm strange bitch / It's bananas like a fucking 'rangatang bitch” – “Do My Thang 
Miley marks a subtle distinction here. Many of her fans were previously in danger of conflating the concept of “strange” with “bananas like a fucking 'rangatang.” However, with her lyricism, Miley gently corrects this forgivable misconception with a public service announcement. Yet the question remains: How bananas is a ‘rangatang?
 
4. “You played my strings like my guitar / When I look in your eyes I see all the stars / Would you believe / I'm dancing in the mirror / I feel like I got no panties on” – “#GETITRIGHT”
Now, listening to this lyric alone by myself makes me feel uncomfortable, but all true artists should test the boundaries of their audience to reach new levels of meaning. In essence, Miley is attempting in this song what Picasso achieved with his Les Demoiselles d’Avignon or what Dada visionary Marcel Duchamp accomplished with his “Fountain.” Lyrically, Miley scores a simile daily double before effortlessly transitioning to her reflection on the feeling of “[having] no panties on,” a sensation that could only be described as, uh… breezy? Unfortunately, I cannot as of yet interpret the juxtaposition of a song whose musical attributes are akin to smooth R&B hip hop and a title that is reminiscent of an overexcited Tweeter.
5. “To my homegirls here with the big butt / Shaking it like we at a strip club / Remember only God can judge ya / Forget the haters, cause somebody loves ya” – “We Can’t Stop”
Here, Miley clearly preaches a message of unconditional acceptance for those of the female gender with bootylicious attributes and provocative dance moves—a group severely marginalized by the rest of the population.
6. “I got two, ooh letters for you / One of them is F and the other one is U / Cause what you gotta do, is go get yourself a clue” – “FU,” featuring French Montana
While the interpretation of the acronym “FU” might seem obvious, consider that Miley might have been trying to send a more subtle hidden message to her ex-beau Liam Hemsworth.
-Freaking Ugly: has she turned against his rugged good looks and rippling muscles?
-File Upload: did she send him a nasty email?
-Fordham University: will she finally give up her music career, go to college, and get a real job?
-Forretningsudvalg: is she moving to Denmark?
7. “We run things, things don’t run we / Don’t take nothing from nobody” – “We Can’t Stop”
In what must be the most powerful lyric in "Bangerz," Miley breaks with the canon of English grammar to emphasize personal agency. By refusing to use the expected objective case pronoun “us” in favor of the nominative “we,” she not only crafts an effective rhyme pattern, but also metaphorically emphasizes her stark opposition to self-objectification. In doing so, she proclaims her protest against a society that inundates young women and men with pressure to attain a certain body type, consume illegal substances, and overexpose their bodies in a hyper-sexualized way... Oh wait.

With punch season now in full swing, it’s time to present the results of Flyby’s first-ever Final Club Survey. The online survey was emailed out last month to 4,838 sophomores, juniors, and seniors, and was partially or fully completed 1,927 times (though it should be noted that individuals could have taken the survey more than once). In the final installment of a six-part series on the survey results, we take a look at whether respondents believe final clubs should exist at all.
What role do Harvard’s final clubs play on campus? Do they represent the worst in a culture of elitism or are they perfectly legitimate institutions whose social events and spaces are a positive presence on campus? Clearly, campus opinion is divided on these questions. But how does that divide actually break down? 
SOCIAL EFFECTS ON CAMPUS
Crimson articles from years past have painted final clubs as bastions of privilege that are irrevelant to the rest of the Harvard social scene. But our survey suggests that while female clubs are not perceived to have a significant impact on today’s campus social scene, male clubs are perceived to have an impact—for better or for worse.
When asked to evaluate the social effects of Harvard’s five female final clubs on campus, a plurality of respondents—46 percent—characterized these effects as neutral. Respondents who said the female clubs had social effects either way were evenly split, with 27 percent saying female final clubs have positive or very positive social effects, and 27 percent saying the female clubs’ social impact is negative or very negative.
Overall, respondents were more critical of the social effects of male clubs on campus. A majority of respondents—54 percent—said they believe the male clubs have negative or very negative social effects on campus.  Twenty-five percent characterized the social impact of male clubs as positive or very positive, and just 21 percent of respondents said they believe the male clubs have a neutral social impact on campus.
Women were more likely than men to criticize male final clubs, with 57 percent of female respondents characterizing the social effects of male final clubs as negative or very negative, compared to just 49 percent of male respondents. 
Respondents’ perceptions of the social effects of clubs varied with the frequency with which they reported going to male final club parties. Seventy-six percent of respondents who said they never attend male final club parties characterized the social impact of the male clubs as negative or very negative, compared to just 18 percent of respondents who said they go to male final club parties more than once a week.
UNIVERSITY RECOGNITION
Although a majority of respondents said they believe male clubs have negative or very negative social effects on campus, a majority—54 percent—agreed that the University should not recognize the clubs in accordance with its policy of not recognizing student organizations that discriminate based on gender. Thirty-two percent of respondents said they disagree with the University’s stance, while 15 percent were undecided. 
TO ABOLISH OR NOT TO ABOLISH?
Should the 222-year-old tradition of final clubs at Harvard continue? A majority—58 percent—said they believe male clubs should be kept running. Twenty-two percent said they believe male clubs should be abolished, and 20 percent were undecided.
Respondents also generally advocated keeping female final clubs running. Fifty-nine percent of the 1,460 respondents saying that female clubs should not be abolished, with 19 percent saying they should be shut down and 22 percent undecided. 
Respondents who identified as homosexual or bisexual were more likely to be in favor of abolishing both male and female clubs. Women were more likely than men to be undecided about whether the male and female clubs should be abolished. A greater percentage of men than women said clubs should be abolished, and a greater percentage of men than women also said the clubs should not be abolished. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, respondents who spent more time partying at male final clubs were more likely to oppose abolishing male final clubs, while students who said they never party at final clubs were more likely than self-identified final club partygoers to be in favor of abolishing the male clubs.
 TAKEAWAYS
The results of our survey show that while respondents largely think that male final clubs are a negative presence on Harvard’s campus and do not believe the University should recognize male and female clubs as official student organizations, they stop short at calling for the clubs’ abolition.

Believe me, I am grateful that no one has defecated on Harvard laundry, but I’ve suddenly realized that I have no laundry to be soiled because it turns out Harvard students do not know how to properly use laundry machines at all.
Taking care of your own clothes may be a foreign concept, especially if it’s the first time you’re on your own, but that's no excuse; at this point the experience of cleaning my clothes has become absolutely exasperating.
One of the worst crimes apart from murder, biking in the Yard, and loving Yale is that of leaving your laundry in a machine for the whole day. No one wants to take out your wet clothes. No one should take out your wet clothes. You have a timer on your phone for a reason. It’s not that hard to take thirty minutes away from sleeping in Lamont to move your laundry so someone else can wash out the beer and soda from their last dorm party.
For those who do take out their laundry, congratulations! But the battle isn’t over. Make sure to take everything out. Nothing is worse than taking out  my clothes and finding a piece of underwear that isn’t mine. Check, then double check, then triple check if you have taken everything out. I just don’t want half of your lucky pair of socks.
Also be careful of what you’re putting in the machines. It’s always a great, but mostly terrible, surprise for me to see the many strange things that can be plucked from a washer or a dryer—like Chipotle wrappers or used band-aids.
And if you really can’t handle doing it on your own, there’s always HSA Cleaners!

The College’s top administrator treated undergraduates to another adorably quirky email on Monday, this time updating us on the campus beekeeping scene, the fall foliage, and his latest reading pursuits.
Like the sugar maple trees he described, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister's prose in the email was “fully on fire with the reds and oranges that are the stuff of poetry.” 
In our favorite part of the email, Pfister informed us that he is currently reading a mystery by Louise Penny called "How the Light Gets in: A Chief Inspector Gamache Novel.”
 
“There are several in the series and this is the most recent,” Pfister wrote. “I think I identify with the Chief Inspector.”
 
No further thoughts on what Pfister thought of "The Flower of Empire: An Amazonian Water Lily, the Quest to Make it Bloom, and the World it Created," the plant biology book he told us he was reading last month.
 
Next time Pfister sends ones of these emails to the student body, we hope he gives us more details. Where does our dean read these books he emails us about? Does he enjoy coffee or baked goods as he flips through the pages? Does he talk about his reading interests with other administrators in a University Hall book club?
