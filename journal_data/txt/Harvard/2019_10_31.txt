By grappling with some of the most divisive issues facing American society, “Watchmen” does not shy away from courting controversy. Under showrunner Damon Lindelof, “Watchmen” passes both comic book source material and a bounty of hot button political topics through the lens of an auteur responsible for some of this millennium’s greatest work in television. Historically in film, experiments such as these have either gone wonderfully right (think Christopher Nolan and “The Dark Knight”) or horribly wrong (Ang Lee and “Hulk”). It remains to be seen how Lindelof will handle this series as it progresses, but if the first episode gives any indication, the results could be impressive.
The pilot episode opens with a clip from a silent, black and white film depicting a black marshal, Bass Reeves, apprehending a criminal. Soon, focus shifts to a young black boy in a desolate movie theater watching the film rapturously alongside his mother. Fascinatingly, “Watchmen” begins with a depiction of black empowerment, both in the black and white cinema clip of Bass Reeves and the shot of the boy who clearly draws inspiration from this heroic figure, only for that moment of empowerment to dissipate into utter chaos. The scene in the theater is violently disrupted by the beginning of what the modern viewer comes to recognize as the 1921 Tulsa race riots, and the boy quickly finds himself running terrified through blood-soaked streets until he reaches a group of friends to take him away from the danger, separating him from his family and launching him, along with the audience, into the unknown.
The modern world of “Watchmen,” clearly set up to be considered in parallel with that of the 1921 racially fueled massacre, has plenty of issues of its own. Police officers wear yellow masks on their faces to conceal their identities from terrorist groups and low-level criminals who could target them. One anti-police organization in particular, the Seventh Kavalry, emerges as the primary antagonist early on in the episode. Between the spelling of the organization’s name, their white headgear, and their white, lower class membership, parallels to the Ku Klux Klan become exceedingly obvious. The police force (which, notably, has several black members) suffers a shocking attack at the hands of the Kavalry when a member of the criminal group shoots at an officer making a routine traffic stop. The ensuing investigation of this shooting lays the groundwork for the primary storyline around which the rest of the episode focuses.
The season premiere leaves audiences with a lot to process in terms of narrative, shock value, and real-world reflection. The worldbuilding laid out in this premiere is almost too intricate to describe succinctly at all, and yet its complexity never takes away from the immersiveness of the story. Backgrounds of characters are hinted at, but never fully revealed. Details of “Watchmen’s” alternate version of Oklahoma are mentioned in passing without bogging down the narrative flow with explicit explanation. Actor Robert Redford has apparently been elected president of this alternate America, a fact which comes up a few times throughout the episode without thorough detail. A poster in the classroom where protagonist Angela (Regina King) talks to her son’s classmates about her “baking” job lists the “four most important American presidents”: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Richard Nixon, and Redford.
Above all other social commentary at play, “Watchmen” most seriously grapples with two issues: race and policing. The inversion of stereotypical racial roles throughout the premier episode immediately subverts the biases of viewers. First off, the black and white film reminiscent of 1915’s notoriously racist “Birth of a Nation” that opens the episode stars the black hero Reeves in place of the Klansmen protagonists of D.W. Griffith’s aforementioned film. Furthermore, the fact that an apparent majority of police officers are people of color subverts traditional ideas about the kinds of people who tend to serve in law enforcement. Police in the world of “Watchmen” grapple with very real problems of transparency and accountability, dealing with frustrating red tape during true life-or-death situations, and yet it is not clear whether viewers are meant to see them as powerless and at risk or as dangerous but kept in check.
An episode of television as captivating, political, and frankly terrifying as this one was bound to catch some backlash, as indeed it has. Yet its political subtext works because it is not heavy-handed, but rather so thoroughly integrated into the world that these characters inhabit that it feels like a natural offshoot of their story. It constantly forces us to evaluate where our sympathies lie along the lines drawn by race, occupation, and class, yet it presents these decisions to the audience without overt subjective analysis. If the showrunners continue to provoke and unsettle audiences without sacrificing a compelling narrative for political commentary, “Watchmen” could stand as one of television’s defining political statements of the modern era.

There is no real plot to “Year of the Monkey,” which is perhaps what makes it so delectable. Inherently poetic and gorgeous, punk poet Patti Smith’s new memoir stretches across the year 2016 as she takes several trips across the U.S. fueled by late night dreams, clouded reality, and treasured memories. With her exquisite language, Smith creates a work at once fascinated with and frightened of death, as she reflects on the events that follow the hospitalization and eventual death of her dear friend Sandy Pearlmen, a rock critic and fellow poet.
Smith travels across several states, starting first in Santa Cruz before shortly finding herself trampling in the Arizona desert, hitchhiking to San Francisco and even wandering around a Kentucky farm. These trips are all spontaneous swerves that prove enlightening for her and rich in description for the reader. Though there are time stamps and seasons mentioned, the work itself is never truly linear since Smith drops in and out of her own memories, floating between imagined scenarios and factual events all the time. She wryly acknowledges both the absurdity and power of her experience, writing, “The trouble with dreaming, I was thinking, is that one can be drawn into a mystery that is no mystery at all, occasioning absurd observations and discourse leading to not a single reality-based conclusion.” Yet her willingness to be led in and out of the different moments speaks to her overall theme of timelessness: Regardless of what era we are in, values and principles should never change.
In the section "Why Belinda Carlisle Matters,” Smith tells us about writing in a cafe in Seattle, but in the next moment she flies us to her small hometown in southern New Jersey where she reflects on the books she devoured in the local library as a precocious nine-year-old. Smith works best in these sprawling narrative shifts, because she so skillfully occupies the liminal spaces she creates — at once grounded in real feelings, but also filled with imaginary characters and distant memories.
In a work so entrenched in the passage of time and death, it is almost a relief that Smith never takes herself too seriously. She keeps the mood light with the ever present Dream Motel sign, Smith’s fixed image of a large sign to an inn in Santa Cruz, that seems to follow her wherever she goes, engaging her in conversation and challenging her thoughts. Like an omnipresent Dr. T. J. Eckelburg, it haunts Smith. Yet it strays from its predecessor with its cheeky remarks, and friendly banter.
Like many of her previous works, Smith draws upon a rich literary tradition. Her prose-poetry style invokes the drunken melodies of Charles Baudelaire’s “Les Fleur du Mal,” while her winding between reality and dream are most obviously a nod to Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland.” Samuel Beckett’s absurdism is never really far behind either, especially in scenes where Smith re-encounters the potentially made up figure of Ernest, a fellow traveler and lover of literature.
The constant literary, artistic, and musical references are par for the course when it comes to Smith’s work, and in “Year of the Monkey,” they play an equally important role. Smith clearly does not put in these references for mere cultural capital, but rather to earnestly build upon the complex ideas she explores and bring in a myriad of aesthetics. When she sits on her hotel patio in Santa Cruz, waiting to hear news about Sandy’s condition, Smith finds herself “wrapped in a blanket like a convalescent in ‘The Magic Mountain.’’” Later, she feels the urgent need to leave the hotel premises lest she end up like the soldier from this same book “who goes up a hill and never comes down.” The Thomas Mann references perfectly encapsulate Smith’s desolate feelings and set the philosophical tone for the rest of her journey.
Ultimately, Smith’s layered images and indulgent phrases are all her own. Her writing oozes with excessive description. To Smith’s credit, this is never a bad thing considering how poetically she writes. While visiting Sandy at the ICU Smith finds herself “projecting constellations of words onto his white sheets, an endless jumble of phrases streaming from the mouths of miraculous totems lining an inaccessible horizon.” With this one sentence, Smith has rendered the entire process of thinking into a complex yet compact line, its pared down nature a testament to her deft manipulation of metaphorical language. It is also her strange fixation on strangers, her ability to make even the most mundane encounters an event which highlights her literary prowess.
For a book so focused on the real events that rocked 2016, most notably the U.S. elections (on which she reflects, “Election night I joined a gathering of good comrades and we watched the terrible soap opera called the American election unfold on a large-screen TV.”), Smith largely ignores the modern world, in particular the tech gadgets that come with it. Sure, there are mentions of cell phones and chargers here and there, but Smith regularly navigates life without her phone (it’s apparently always dead) and never seems to encounter people that are on them at all. With all the talking signs and reoccuring imaginary figures, it is this fact that seems most bizarre.
In the end, this is part of her most powerful observation: Human connection still exists and we have to fight to keep it alive. Smith insists that there exists a world where it is still normal for strangers to talk to one another or give each other rides, such that times might not have changed all that much. As much as this work is a sleepy trek through memories and random encounters, it carries an urgent message. The hate, death, and violence that Smith reflects on in her “A Kind of Epilogue” only exists when we let them get a grip on us — we have to be vigilant. Though “Year of the Monkey” at times seems to occupy a bygone era, it is a necessary reminder, as Smith so aptly puts it, that “the trouble with dreaming is that we eventually wake up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the last decade and a half, the city of Boston has reigned over the professional sports world high and large. Their teams have reached and won championship games in virtually every year. The New England Patriots, in particular, have been the most successful team in the National Football League recently, winning three of the last five championships and bringing Patriots’ fans a lot of hometown pride. But while watching a Patriots game this weekend, I looked into the stands and noticed that despite the fact that almost 70 percent of the leagues’ players were black, the audience in the bleachers was significantly different demographically. Although the NFL does not release any figures on fan demographics, I challenge anyone to look at the stands during a game and not notice what I did: black players and white fans.
This does not look great.
Though I can not speculate on the exact demographics of the audience, looking at teams’ back offices sheds a brighter light on this problem. Only two teams’ owners are people of color. The New York Times published an article earlier this year titled “The N.F.L.'s Minority Head Coaching Ranks Are Thinning,” which cites that though the NFL started last season with more black coaches than ever before in its history, a majority of those fired through the course of the year were also black. The article’s title speaks for itself: In the NFL, there exists a culture of black players and white coaches. The divergence between the demographics of those playing and those in more stable long-term management and coaching positions is extremely problematic. While players may earn sizeable salaries for a few years, their short tenures and social pressures result in up to 78 percent of players having financial distress or filing for bankruptcy.
This issue is even more pronounced when you consider the manner in which players and their contracts are managed, especially when transferring between teams. Players begin their career by being drafted and are essentially assigned to a team, and go on for the rest of their playing career being passed around and traded by teams, always with a dollar sign attached. Through this trading and buying of players, it is almost as if athletes are commodified and their basic humanity is reduced to a price tag.
This reduction can be best seen in the way in which the fans talk about the players. Rather than rooting for teams, fans now often root for individual players and express concern when players are injured or put out of commission — not for the players themselves, but for the impact that the players’ injuries will have on their fantasy rosters. Injuries no longer are bringing out the sympathy of the fans, but mean tweets and personal attacks from fans who fault the very player for their injury, or from opposing teams’ fans who cheer on the injury. These injuries are not only extremely painful for the players, but can often mean the end of a player’s season or career.
Some might disagree with my characterization of the way in which players are traded and in the way that player’s contracts are described – they might argue that the players enter into the league freely and willingly. But even how freely this occurs can be questioned.
For many of the players, the time and effort they have put into their sport has meant sacrificing time they could have put into their academics or career prospects. When players commit to playing for a college, they are promised an education in return, but some schools have demonstrably failed this. Furthermore, when you are 26 and your life for the last 15 years revolved around football, you do not have much of a decision about what to do — it is all but the only option. When you get hurt, this can mean the end of not only your athletic career but also your only source of future livelihood.
Athletes, particularly those playing professionally, are human. We should treat them as such. Fans should respect them more and treat them in a more humane fashion, caring more for the people than the game. Teams should not buy and sell humans. They should especially not put their teams’ interest above their players’ by letting injured athletes play. Overall, we need to stop objectifying athletes and become more caring, compassionate fans.
The way we treat the athletes we cheer for must be informed by the social, racial and power dynamics that shape their careers. The apparent racial divide between players, fans, coaches, and owners is a clear problem that must be accepted and addressed. It might not be possible to entirely overcome these divides, but an inability to totally address them should not prevent us from confronting them.
In the end, we must ensure that athletes are not a product and that fans are not the consumers, especially when those in the stands or in the back office and those on the field look as different demographically as they do. As it is now, it’s a bad look.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outwardly, Harvard students present as innovators. To others, we’re elite college progressives who challenge the current system, demanding it to align with us and our values. We’re socially conscious learners, the “snowflakes” bending the storm to weather to our will. We write. We protest. We rally. We advocate. We scrape change out of this place and cast the remnants of an antiquated system from under our fingernails.
To some extent, there’s some truth to this perception. The people, education, and experiences on this campus force us to think beyond ourselves and imagine a future we actively design. But social politics on our campus tell a different story.
Within the ivy-covered walls of our ivory tower, we cling to generations of self-imposed hierarchies and rules, governing our roles and our leadership, generating the social stratification that drives many of our actions. This initial desire to change becomes difficult to see from the inside. Certain social circles are selective, closed; one must adapt to a culture and be vetted for the veneration that comes with inclusion. Some student organizations exist within hierarchies, often with seemingly hundreds of pages of rules — written or unwritten — that its members immediately adopt, take themselves, and fold into their personalities. We dive so quickly and so deeply into various facets of this institution that we become them. To ask these institutions, then, to change? How do we alter an institution and a system we find ourselves so deeply knotted in?
It’s interesting how this comes about. When we first arrive on campus, many of us hang on to the character whom we formed throughout our first 18 years of life. In our first few months in Harvard Yard, we stay connected with our high schools, our communities, our old friends — regardless of whether they are in Boston, Los Angeles, or Singapore.
But something changes near the end of our first semester, as we begin to cast off our old selves and fully begin to adopt Harvard for ourselves. We understand (or at least begin to) the campus, its people, how things work to get things done. We know which groups to join, which to avoid, which to look up to, and which to critique. Hierarchies begin to solidify in our minds. As a result, we begin to adopt the structures and strictures that the groups we comped our first semester impose on us. While it is critical to find a community here and make Harvard your own, there’s a limit to where you as an individual should shift yourself and your views to fit that of an institution.
These shifts aren’t necessarily bad, depending on the group and how we feel about it. But these changes within ourselves, and our new willingness to support different causes, values, or organizations provide an interesting look at how we adapt so quickly to our surroundings. Some of us come to this campus not knowing anyone or anything about its institutions, but by the end of our first year, we’re fully on board with the unwritten rules that make Harvard run. We adopt the precedents that prior generations of Harvard students have cobbled together over time, and we hold fast to them, as if we’d made them ourselves.
Rules and norms exist for a reason, often to fill a necessary void or gap within the way Harvard runs. And perhaps there’s an argument to be made about the strength of social networks or the cultural capital that one leverages when they adopt an institution and befriend its traditions and systems. There’s a history of others who followed the same path, saluting you as you walk it yourself, showing you that there’s value in upholding the institution as is. But there is a disconnect between the way our campus outwardly presents as a socially-conscious, activist-oriented place, and the ways in which we all respect and do our part to cohere to the traditions of students past, actively or not.
At times, when we intertwine ourselves so deeply with these institutions and their hierarchies, its effects ripple beyond constraining our intentions to enact change. It affects our social lives, our friendships, and even the way we interact with certain spaces on campus — and this can quickly become toxic if we don’t recognize ourselves and others outside of the circles we keep.
In order to reconcile our past and present selves, there is a need to divorce the individual from the institution. As individuals, as students, and as change-makers, we need to reflect on what our true goals are as members of our communities or institutions, irrespective of any larger group missions. We need to weigh what is important to us, and create the change that we want to see, and the future we want to be ours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To many, Harvard’s 6.5 percent return on its investments this year might seem like more of the same. Another year, another drop in the bucket for the wealthiest university in the world. But there’s a lot more to unpack when it comes to Harvard’s fiscal health.
We are concerned that Harvard’s return lagged behind the S&P 500, as well as a standard 60-40 stock-to-bond ratio investment portfolio. But it should be noted that within the Ivy League only Brown was able to beat this second benchmark, which would have yielded nearly 10 percent returns this year.
As economic growth begins to slow in the U.S. and around the world, it’s not totally shocking to see lower returns to the endowment. Additionally, Harvard logged a significant growth in operating surplus, which increased from $196 million to $298 million. This increase speaks well of the University’s financial management under Harvard Management Corporation CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar.
Both of these outcomes may be due to increased caution in the runup to a potential recession. Fear of such a crash is building; two weeks ago an article in Bloomberg predicted a 27 percent chance of a crash in the next 12 months, a noted increase from its analogous prediction one year ago, but still less likely than before the 2008 crisis. Either way, Harvard has signaled that it is in the midst of preparing for difficult times. A year ago, we praised University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s efforts to rein in budget inefficiencies and encouraging scenario planning, despite the health of the economy at the time.
One of the reasons Bacow and Harvard pushed for fiscal caution is the federal endowment tax, to which the University is subject for the first time this year. Harvard continues to lobby against the 1.4 percent tax, submitting its formal opposition to the Treasury Department this past month alongside more than 30 other universities. The tax would cost Harvard roughly $48.9 million, though the Treasury has not finalized its guidelines.
We continue to support Harvard in its opposition to the endowment tax, and believe that tight fiscal management is an essential defensive strategy as these lobbying efforts continue. But whatever approach Harvard takes to lessening the burden of the new tax, it should not under any circumstances cut financial aid, which it has cautioned may be necessary in a recent report. The University’s capacity to accept low-income students should not be up for debate, even in a budget crunch.
Finally, as Narvekar reaches the halfway point in his five-year plan for revamping the HMC, we would suggest — alongside many of our peers and others in our broader community — that now is as good a time as ever for the University to think about how it can shift its investments out of fossil fuels. In May, we called on Harvard to divest from fossil fuels. We argued then that symbols matter, and we continue to stand proudly behind that position. But it strikes us that 2019 seems to pose a perfect example of how fossil fuel divestment may not only be symbolically significant but fiscally prudent. Recent reports indicate that some green energy-based exchange-traded funds significantly outpaced fossil fuel investments, which saw only 1 percent growth in 2019, by 32 percent.
A ragtag crew of student opinion editors, we’re no HMC — nor do we aspire to be — but a 32 percent better return seems pretty compelling to us.

My mother’s closet door is lined with metal, and there is a deadbolt that locks from the inside. To an extent, it is bulletproof.
The story goes as follows: The previous owners of our house, an older couple nearing retirement, installed the metal door and its deadbolt after a home invasion. The woman was home alone when a burglar entered the house in the middle of the day through a door left unlocked. The neighborhood felt safe — they assumed a thrown deadbolt was unnecessary. But after the invasion, it was no longer safe for them. They turned my mother’s closet into a makeshift safe room, one that I didn’t even know existed until I knocked on the door once at age 12 and asked why it sounded so hollow.
There was another home invasion many years later, when I was in high school. This time, it was a house down the street. Two men entered the home in the middle of the day through an unlocked door, and the homeowner hid in her closet alone. On the phone with 911, she tearfully begged them to hurry, because her dog –– a chiweenie named Pretzel –– was asleep in the middle of her bed and she didn’t want him to get hurt.
Pretzel slept through the whole thing.
***
Once we were assured that no damage was done, that no one (canine or otherwise) was hurt, the neighborhood got a kick out of the story. We laughed at Pretzel the chiweenie, at the stupidity of two robbers walking into a house in broad daylight. We laughed because we could –– because it did not happen to us.
I was able to laugh like this often as a child. My family had an alarm system that never went off, with a panic button that never had to be pressed. I rode my bike around the neighborhood alone at dusk, and the only thing I worried about on drives home in the early hours of the morning was that a wayward deer might walk out in front of my car. My friends and I drove around every part of town late at night, on unmarked back roads where you could go as fast as you wanted and spit gravel, through intersections where stoplights didn’t work, past houses with broken windows through which mysterious shadows moved.
In houses around town, there were shotguns in closets. There were pistols in glove compartments, and knives in back pockets. The National Rifle Association maintained a strong presence and told us that in order to stay safe, we needed to protect ourselves –– my town is full of “good guys with guns.” I learned to shoot a BB gun when I was six and went to the gun range for the first time with my father when I was seven. From time to time, he would take guns from our safe, where they lived behind six inches of locked steel, and clean them on the kitchen table.
When I was eight or nine, I rode my bike past a police car in the driveway of a run-down house a street or two over from mine. I had ridden past it countless times in the previous weeks, thinking nothing of the unassuming two-bedroom that sat far back from the road, its robin’s egg-blue face unlit and unmoving. A few days later, my mom told me not to ride my bike past there anymore. I didn’t know what a “meth house” was at that point in my life, so I continued to ride my bike past it anyway.
One time, two of my friends were sitting at a red light when a man in all red clothing pulled up alongside their passenger door on a bicycle. He had a red bandana around his neck –– the symbol of the Bloods, who, according to rumors at my high school, have a decent presence back home. When my friend noticed the outline of a handgun in the waistband of the man’s shorts, he accelerated through the red light so fast that he left rubber on the pavement. He retold the story several times, and we always laughed at the way he did it: comical, with his head thrown back and right foot flooring an imaginary gas pedal, mimicking the screech of rubber on the road.
We grew up around guns. But for my friends, there was a difference, something inherently more threatening, between a gun in a closet and a pistol in a waistband at 1 a.m.
My hometown is ranked 54 out of 100 on the FBI’s Most Dangerous Cities list in 2019, and, based on violent crime statistics, is the most dangerous city in Texas. It is a well-known fact among our population of approximately 65,000. A lot of the statistics refer to drug-related crime. We are one of the only larger cities on our stretch of Interstate 30 –– the only major stop for hours between Dallas, Shreveport, and Little Rock –– and our cradle at the intersection of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma makes us a prime conduit for drug trafficking. Multiple gangs claim territory in the area, and rumors float about white-collar crime that turns violent.
It is also a city where you can buy a gun at Walmart or Academy Sports. If you don’t pass the background checks, wait for the next gun show to come through –– there, you can purchase firearms with cash.
***
I went back home the summer after my freshman year, where I worked an internship and reconnected with an old friend. She was a girl that I had grown up with in that small-town way that kids grow up together –– tangential in each other’s circles, at one point growing closer only to inevitably drift apart again. Around age 16, we had stopped seeing each other without really knowing why.
Over that summer, we didn’t do much. We drove around backroads, watched movies at her apartment, and complained that there was nothing to do. After a year in Cambridge, nine-to-five monotony and an empty schedule were anathema; the boredom became heavy, and I felt as though I was stagnating among the memories of a childhood that had long since passed on. But being alone was worse than being bored, so even though I quickly grew tired of driving through backroads and watching movies and complaining that there was nothing to do, we continued.
On a particularly humid night in the middle of August –– one of my last nights in town –– she invited me to her apartment. After I get there, two of her friends came over, both a year or so older than us. One had brought a six-pack of Corona, and as he popped a bottle cap off on the edge of the formica countertop, I realized he was already drunk. My friend lectured him about drinking and driving while I watched the movie playing unnoticed on the television, not caring where the rest of the conversation went.
I do not remember which thread of conversation brought them to the topic of guns until I looked up from the movie when I heard my friend say that she had one –– a .22 pistol that her dad had bought her when she moved into the apartment, citing the need for self-defense as a 19-year-old girl living on her own. And it was somewhere in the next room.
Suddenly, the boys lit up, demanding to know the gun’s exact location with the excitement of a child demanding to know what’s inside a gift box under the Christmas tree. She laughed and refused to tell them, and after a minute or so of back-and-forth between the three, one boy darted to the bedroom and started to ransack her things, tearing open drawers and throwing bras and underwear onto the carpet in pursuit of the .22. As the boy on the barstool jumped up to follow, an empty Corona bottle wobbled and toppled to the floor. It shattered on the tile, flinging bits of glass in all directions.
I didn’t know then that that would be the last time I went over to her apartment. I don’t know what happened to the boy with the Corona –– if he drove home, or if he spent the night on the couch. I do not remember either boy’s name.
But I do know that I left without saying goodbye. I left with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach, and I drove around in the dark for a while to get rid of it. I arrived home to a house that felt different than it had felt before I left for her apartment that night, and when I walked past my mother’s closet to get to the bathroom, my mind lingered on the metal door and the deadbolt.
I do not know if I was actually in danger that night. I just know that I no longer felt like laughing.

Nestled between exhibits displaying glass flowers and preserved mammal specimens, I see them: dried mushrooms with stems as thick, tough, and red as walking canes; samples of lichen that resemble curled up gyro meat; and cotton-white fungi peeking out of preserved ant bodies. Each time I pass another shroom-themed booth, it feels as if I’ve stumbled upon a hidden treasure.
It’s a warm Saturday afternoon at the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Visitors are lining up for tickets by the minute, but it’s hard to parse who is here to gaze at the rare minerals from who is here to stroll through the sixth iteration of the Fabulous Fungus Fair.
Students from Systematic Botany professor Donald H. Pfister’s class, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 54: “Biology of the Fungi,” staff booths featuring mushrooms with industrial applications (the thick red ones are as hard as concrete and can be used as bricks), symbiotic superpowers (the lichen’s dual identity as algae allows it to absorb toxins), and stealthy parasitic properties (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis, the white fungus, hijack the minds of ants it infects.)
Young children zoom through the interactive exhibits, rubbing mushrooms between their fingers and playing fungus-inspired versions of their favorite board games. In “Fungus Operation,” they carefully extract parts of the fungus body: a portion of the cap, the gill, the stalks. In “Fungus Land,” they slide their mushroom-shaped game pieces down a winding path to “Shroom Stop.”
Amidst the elementary school chaos, some college-aged girls stop at the Operation Station and ask a student working the booth how to detect an edible mushroom from an inedible one.
Pfister says it’s not uncommon to see adults at the Fabulous Fungus Fair.“Fungi are making more and more appearances in the news now. Many 20- to 30-year-olds are interested in eating healthy and the environment,” he explains. In his experience, a newfound cultural interest in fungi has manifested in a surge of media inquiries about the fungal types and properties.
The girls make their way to a quiz station to answer a pressing question: What fungus are you? The Buzzfeed-esque quiz asks about their favorite climate and solicits three adjectives describing their personalities. It turns out that I am a mushroom that grows in the chilly depths of Antarctica, as are most festival attendees. The quiz booth presenters say that most people wish they were black truffles, but only one person has yet attained this status.
When the first Fabulous Fungus Fair took place in 2012, the museum had just opened its New England Forests Gallery. While this gallery included a minimal fungi presence, museum administrators sought to expand programming on what one student calls “the often-forgotten third kingdom.”
Wendy Derjue-Holzer, the museum’s education director, co-founded the fair with Pfister. She says it not only “gives the public a broader sense of what fungi are and of the important role they play in the ecosystem” but also “gives students the chance to practice communicating with the public, to practice teaching, rather than learning.”
Pfister hopes that the visuals will help draw people in and make microbiology more accessible. He first fell in love with fungi while growing up in rural Ohio, “fascinated by the things [he] saw growing on corn crops.”
His students smile at children, gesture enthusiastically at their live specimens, and tour their classmates’ booths. Clayton Ziemke, a student in Pfister’s course, said that he enjoys working at his station since he does not have many opportunities to interact with kids as a laboratory technician. Over the course of two hours, he has learned to speak the language of curious children, and settled on a few “standard catchy terms” that they seemed to understand best.
As children scamper out of the exhibit, Pfister tells me a story. The day prior, several students had asked him to collect a specific strain of mushrooms for their exhibit the next day. He didn’t make any promises, but on his walk home he suddenly noticed a cluster of the very same fungi.
“Once you tune in and look for them,” he says, “you see the world in a different way.”

In bold red text, Moonbox Productions makes it abundantly clear that they will not permit me to throw toast, rice, or water on stage. Instead, I am free to shush Eddie; sing with the Phantoms; internalize, then verbalize, that Brad’s an “asshole” and Janet’s a “slut”; and, in case my throat gets sore from overuse, make lewd gestures.
When I see the venue for the Cambridge production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the carb and water prohibition makes complete sense. It is a glorious set — part movie theater, part cabaret with a bar, part bankrupt retail store: an “Everything Must Go” banner and mannequin limbs line the proscenium arch.
The space was formerly a local candy store, Hidden Sweets, which was then replaced by its more corporate successor, a Lululemon popup. Now, it has been gutted for Rocky Horror’s return to Harvard Square.
In 1984, Boston’s Full Body Cast performed the first staged Rocky Horror show in the United States at the Harvard Square Theater, an act that would continue to run for 28 years until the theater closed in April 2012. David S. Lucey Jr., the director of this production of Rocky Horror, remembers the tradition fondly.
“It was always a unique experience — always boisterous and fun,” he recounts. “Everyone was always welcoming and had a great time. It was sort of this gathering of people in a safe space where we could all be a little weird.”
Lucey mentions during our interview that he was “a weird kid” — something Rocky Horror fans seem to have in common. A woman who goes only by Will says that her mother first told her Rocky Horror was “something for the freaks and outcasts,” she says. “And she told me it was something that I would like.”
“[Rocky Horror] has always resonated with me since I was a kid,” Will says. She came to the show dressed as a female version of Rocky, in a gold lamé sports bra and a platinum-blonde Elsa wig from “Frozen.”
Rocky Horror’s return to Cambridge is one of rebellious triumph, occurring again amidst the closure of longtime Harvard Square staples. In addition to the shuttering of the Harvard Square Theater and Hidden Sweets, John Harvard’s Brewery and Ale House, The World’s Only Curious George Store, Crema Café, and Tealuxe all closed their doors within the last year. Rocky Horror’s lead actor Peter Mill describes these closures as the Square becoming more “corporate” and “sanitized.”
“You go out there, and you see so many corporations coming in, and you see all these high end restaurants and all these branded stores,” says Mill, who stars as Frank N. Furter in Lucey’s production. “I mean, you're losing some of the landmarks.”
This is why Rocky Horror’s creators wanted to bring back something “that's kind of reminiscent of what [the Square] was and what it still can be,” Mill says.
***
I enter Rocky Horror cold, wet, and just plain scared.
Luminaire flood lights in jewel tones and Pepto-bismol pink spill onto the crowd; they illuminate a woman’s gold top, the 2.5-inch-long septum piercing of a man wearing a miniature top hat, and a woman’s Hillary Clinton sweater — not a Hillary Clinton 2016 campaign sweater, but a sweater tessellated with Hillary faces. The dress of the crowd ranges from corseted men wearing sheer black briefs to a simply dressed woman in a teal, floral-patterned blouse and classic light wash ‘mom’ denim.
As the opening number, “Science Fiction - Double Feature,” plays, shyer audience members lipsync while the more intrepid belt out the lyrics. The Phantoms, Rocky Horror’s interactive “ensemble,” slither among us, dissolving the boundaries of cast and audience, inspiring participation.
The cast’s performance is as clean as it was dirty, much like its “callbacks,” the Rocky Horror-specific term for the banter between actors and spectators.
Even so, it is the “Time Warp” that distinguishes the true Rocky Horror “sluts” — die-hard fans like Blair Trippe, who attended the first showings at the Waverly Theater in Greenwich Village while in high school — from the “virgins,” Rocky Horror newcomers like longtime Cambridge resident John A. “Jay” Shetterly ’66. Shetterly missed the early Harvard Square Theater days of Rocky Horror while serving in the Peace Corps and seized the opportunity to see their revival.
Amidst the mallification of the Square, Rocky Horror inspires a new generation of followers while paying homage to the decades-long history of its showings in Cambridge. To Mill, it acknowledges and attempts to reinvigorate the quintessentially Cambridge art scene.
By the production’s end, I feel indoctrinated into a decades-long Time Warp legacy of Rocky Horror showings. As Mill says, Rocky Horror is “an equalizer”; “It unites people in our differences, [in] being as freaky or as outlandish or as bold as we want to be.”
According to Mill, Rocky Horror “shows everyone that it's okay to be that way. It shows people in the most ridiculous of ways that it's okay to be whatever you are.”

It’s a Thursday afternoon in the sleepy town of Arlington, Mass., and close to a thousand Boston locals — clusters of young women and old married couples — filter through the red brick streets. Some link arms against the bitter autumn wind as the masses head straight for John Hancock Hall. The theatre is airy and full of velvet; it radiates glamor. Overheard chatter — “Did you read so-and-so’s review in the New York Times?”— makes me feel like I’m at the opening night of a hit play.
Instead, I’m at a wildly popular Harvard Book Store event: NPR radio host Robin C. Young is set to chat with reporter Ronan Farrow about his explosive book, “Catch and Kill.” Farrow’s work for the New Yorker helped uncover numerous allegations of rape and sexual assault against media mogul Harvey Weinstein, exploding the #MeToo movement. In 2018, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service alongside the New York Times’ Jodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey.
His new book paints the picture of a system of intimidation operated by powerful men in order to silence their accusers — one full of spies, lies, and shadowy contracts. A representative from the bookstore says “Catch and Kill” is “perhaps the best noir of the year, only made more chilling by the fact that it is true.”
And yet the atmosphere in the theater is anything but grave. During the talk, Farrow peppers his comments with Tweet-worthy quips, to the evident delight of an audience that can’t seem to get enough of him.
Young appears equally enamoured with the book and walks the audience members — many of whom have not yet read it — through the highlights. Farrow jokes, semi-seriously, that she should avoid any “spoilers,” a comment that gestures toward the book’s novelistic quality. He refers to the dizzying details of his reporting as the book’s “plot,” and points to the eerie but unintentional “foreshadowing” in his earlier reporting.
Farrow also takes pains to emphasize the meticulous, journalistic fact-checking undergirding the book. He cites his background as a lawyer, which he thinks makes him inherently skeptical; beyond that, he says, his editors at the New Yorker “scrubbed the manuscript clean.”
The conversation focuses on what it was like for Farrow to report these stories, as opposed to highlighting the stories themselves. When Farrow first sets foot on stage, Young mentions that NBC has just accused him of being a “terrorist” for reporting on the media outlet’s attempt to “catch and kill” stories on Weinstein. He deflects the comment with a joke — “That’s making it to my Twitter bio” — and moves on. She probes him later about what it was like being followed by Harvey Weinstein’s spies. “They were like Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum,” he says, recalling how the two men spent three days pursuing the wrong blonde man.
Suddenly earnest again, he recognizes the women and whistleblowers who “made [his] work possible.” “I was just a conduit for their stories,” he says.
But these comments do little to turn the focus away from Farrow the celebrity, the wunderkind child of actress Mia Farrow and Woody Allen. For 20 minutes, Young and Farrow discuss his relationship to his mother; his sister Dylan, who has accused Allen of sexual assault; and his engagement to former Obama speechwriter Jon I. Lovett. Time and time again, Young says to Farrow: “you’re the real deal.” I get the sense that she’s referring not just to his journalistic merits, but to the romantic image some have of him: charming, eloquent, principled.
Young attempts to circle back to the women at the heart of the story, and asks Farrow to “say the names of the brave women” for the audience. He pauses, notes that many of the whistleblowers he spoke to have not revealed themselves publicly, and mentions a few: Rose McGowan, Ambra Gutierrez. For once, the audience is still.
But as the event ends, the chatter shifts back to Farrow himself. “He’s very engaging,” one audience member says as we file out of the theater.
“He looks exactly like his mother,” says another. “Maybe with some Frank Sinatra mixed in.”

On Sept. 7, Joichi Ito resigned as the director of the MIT Media Lab after revelations that he had accepted more than $7.5 million in donations directed or bestowed by Jeffery Epstein and had deliberately anonymized these contributions, referring to Epstein in emails as “he who must not be named” and “Voldemort.” The leaked emails also revealed that complicity went beyond the Media Lab — members of MIT senior administration, including President L. Rafael Reif, were aware of these gifts, knew Epstein was categorized as a ‘disqualified’ donor in M.I.T.’s official donor database, and helped to conceal Epstein’s identity.
These revelations shook MIT’s campus. Yet many people interviewed for this article agreed that there has been a dearth of channels to voice dissent or process emotions about the controversy. On Friday, Oct. 18, Media Lab students and staff hosted an event at the Lab called “Reimagine This Place” in response to the recent revelations. Members of the MIT community were invited to make posters that represented their vision for MIT’s future — and the world’s future. The signs will be hung on walls around both the Lab and the campus. Donations and proceeds from the event’s refreshments will go to the United Nations Trust Fund for Victims of Human Trafficking.
The event was held on the sixth floor of the Media Lab: an angular, gaping white space. A woman with dangly pink earrings bearing the words “We Resist” chatted with a bartender. Lo-fi beats played in the background. Friends arrived in groups of two and three, mingled, and then settled down at one of the many white tables, each laden with art supplies — one table had colored pencils, one pastels, another watercolors. On one side of the room, the glass wall gave way to the sun setting red over the Charles. A screen dominated the other side of the room. It played a slideshow of images from feminist history. The Women’s March, a sea of pussy hats, and a feminist protest from 1975 flashed across the screen.
Cynthia X. Hua, the head organizer, took a pause from running the event to reflect. “I did hope it would have a more positive vibe,” she said. “[I hope] that it can help people channel their anger and frustration with maybe thinking about how things can be better… because a lot of the recent events.” She paused. “It’s been difficult.”
***
“Reimagine This Place” joins a long list of MIT student responses to the Epstein case.
In the wake of the revelations, Rodrigo Ochigame, a former researcher at the Media Lab whose work involved artificial intelligence, said two questions loom: “A conversation around institutional complicity with sexual violence, and one around the moral and political implications of corporate, military, and philanthropic sponsorship.”
Ochigame left his position at the Media Lab on Aug. 15, the same day Ito announced his initial apology for taking money from Epstein. But Ochigame’s moral and political objections to the Media Lab’s funding had been building for a long time. In recent years, the Institute has faced controversy regarding their financial ties to the Koch Brothers and Saudi Arabia.
While at the Lab, Ochigame observed first-hand the “intimate and cozy relationship between elite academia and the corporate lobby.”
“I have come to learn,” he said, “that the ethics of AI is a discourse largely promoted by — the MIT-Harvard initiative that I worked for was fueled by — a Silicon Valley lobby seeking to avoid restrictive legal regulations of controversial technologies like facial recognition.”
The MIT Media Lab declined to comment on any of Ochigame’s concerns mentioned in this piece.
With corporate, military, and philanthropic contributions to academic institutions come ethical complications for research agendas. However subtle, donors wield influence over scientists, over the very questions they seek to answer. “It's about who gets picked. What kinds of ideas are 'interesting’?” Ochigame said. “The researcher is still very much responsive to what they think corporate and philanthropic sponsors want to see.”
For Ochigame, the Epstein revelations were the breaking point.
Ochigame is the lead organizer of a campaign called Democratize MIT, whose demands include the creation of a democratically elected committee including students and staff with binding power to determine policy for ethical fundraising at MIT, including the power to veto specific donors and gifts.
Lilly T. Chin is a graduate student at MIT who is also involved with Democratize MIT. Chin was working at a lab adjacent to the Media Lab as the Epstein revelations became public. On Oct. 1, she published an ‘oral history’ of the turmoil, which was widely circulated online.
Like Ochigame, Chin saw the Epstein revelations as “just last straw moments” in a deeper structural tangle of sexism and opacity in funding.
“You could blame federal funding going down so that you have to go to these private donors and then keep them happy. You can blame structuralized misogyny, to the point where you can invite a convicted pedophile [Epstein] to campus while simultaneously saying that you're trying to improve reporting policies,” Chin explained.
Dan D. M. Calacci, a researcher at MIT Media Lab who helped organize “Reimagine This Place,” said that both of these problems are “tied up in the same sort of structural issue, which is the male assumption of power in places like universities.”
“We organizers felt that the administration is considerably more receptive to demands on [sexual violence], for example increased resources for Violence Prevention and Response, which are very important demands, but won't cost the administration much,” Ochigame claimed.
Improving practices for addressing sexual misconduct would not pose an existential threat to MIT, while a structural reorganization of the Institute’s funding policies might.
***
“One of my lab mates described this as, like, a delayed Me Too Movement for the Academy,” Chin said.
If the Epstein case at MIT represents a version of #MeToo, it is not the #MeToo of accountability for individual instances of misconduct. Rather, it is a structural reckoning with the way misogyny operates at the top administrative level of academic institutions, how misogyny is allowed by the absence of systematic accountability in the acceptance of financial contributions.
Hua sees the Epstein case as an issue of women’s equality — beyond ethical checks on and transparency in the Institute's funding. “It’s reflective of a much larger problem. It's not something that changing funding policies will fix. I think we have to change the way money works in our society and the way society looks at women.”
“Reimagine This Place” was a grassroots event; however, Hua said she worked with an employee at MIT’s Press Office. “Reimagine this Place” is currently the only student-organized event featured on the Media Lab webpage.
The event took place in the Media Lab itself — the belly of the beast. “It's responding to things that happened here, so it should happen here,” Hua said.
“Clearly, the institution is much more receptive and supportive of initiatives that don't link the Epstein case to the broader structural problem,” Ochigame said. From his perspective, MIT is willing to take steps to address misogyny and sexual violence, but not as it pertains to the institution’s cash flow. Chin referred to this as “catharsis without action.”
“I’m not shy about saying [“Reimagine This Place”] is a direct response about that kind of systemic problem,” Calacci said. “We are raising money and in direct response keeping it in people’s minds, giving people space to reflect and think on what both of these things mean.”
“Reimagine This Place” left it up to its attendees to decide whether they saw this #MeToo Movement as one connected with the university’s donation policies or not. As the night wore on, the music bumped, and a little boy in a NASA suit arrived. One person made a poster that declared “Stop Selling out Students;” another read, “How do we know MIT professors were not on that island?” Several posters announced, “The Future is Female.”

In 1914, the Radcliffe Civics Club formed, unifying the school’s Socialism, Suffrage, and Anti-Suffrage Clubs under one organization. Despite the diametrically opposed ideologies of its sub-organizations, the Civics Club not only survived, but thrived, for six years.
As explained in the 1914 Radcliffe Student Handbook, the club’s initial goal was to “make each girl realize what part she, as a college graduate, will be expected to play in the political and economic world outside her college.” But this outward focus faded as the club became a space dedicated to student debate and discussion of political issues. This increased engagement with its chapters’ “utterly conflicting views,” as stated in the club description, turned out to be a key source of the Civics Club’s success.
Initially an umbrella political organization for its three chapters, the Civics Club began to publicize its embrace of “widely differing opinions” in the Radcliffe Student Handbook in 1917. Radcliffe formed the school’s first official Debating Club soon after, drawing new membership and prominence to the Civics Club as members competed in — and won — national debate competitions. The Civics Club also began hosting weekly debates over political topics ranging from “The Monroe Doctrine in its Relation toMexico” to “War – Is it Inevitable?” By 1918, these meetings boasted 70 regular attendees, despite being held at midnight and charging a 25 cent fine for each absence.
These discussions, it seems, never got very heated: Their goal was consensus. The purpose of each debate, according to Sarah Wambaugh, a Radcliffe alumna from the class of 1902 who advised the club, was to generate “warm political discussion in which practically all the members take part.” By September 1917, the group’s self-described aims were to “stimulate liberal and intelligent thought” and “reach satisfactory conclusions in current problems.”
As for why these debates remained so uncontentious, homogeneity across the Radcliffe student body might account for some of this “warmth.” Around this time, Harvard and Radcliffe students were almost exclusively white, and about 80 percent came from Anglo-Saxon Protestant upper-class backgrounds. One such student was Civics Club president Rosamond Eliot ’17 of Boston’s prominent Eliot family. Students’ elite status might have reduced personal stake — and, with it, strife — surrounding the political issues discussed. For instance, lighthearted debate over Philippine independence likely comes easier when you live thousands of miles from the Philippines.
But some argued that the responsibility that the Civics Club placed on members to hold their own in political debate was nonetheless valuable in its own right. In a 1916 issue of the Radcliffe Quarterly, Wambaugh praised the club’s emphasis on debate as a means to develop its members’ self esteem:
“As a training in ability to speak extemporaneously, and to express thought with ease and composure, the practice in discussion may produce valuable results,” she wrote, adding, “There is, I suppose, no one possession more desirable for the college woman than an ability to express herself in public clearly and with self-confidence.”
And, indeed, the club’s debate component seems to have left its mark on alumnae. In contrast to the Radcliffe graduates before them — nearly every 1913 and 1914 alumna who entered the workforce became a teacher or a secretary — numerous Civics Club graduates dedicated their post-college lives to tackling societal issues through political organizing, advocacy, and academic research.
Among Civics Club leadership alone: 1915-16 Socialist Chapter President Elizabeth Brandeis ’18 (daughter of Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis) became a prominent labor legislation expert and activist. 1919-20 Civics Club Vice President Elizabeth Boody ’20 (later Schumpeter) became an economist and expert on economic and political relations between the U.S. and the Pacific in the 1930s as war with Japan approached. 1919-20 Civics Club Secretary Frieda Gilbert ’21 lectured to her fellow members of Detroit’s Jewish community on behalf of the United Palestine Appeal, a group dedicated to alleviating the suffering of Palestinians — a staunch advocate for seeing the “other side” of the debate, as the Civics Club had so strongly encouraged.
Wambaugh had hoped that Civics Club discussions would reduce Radcliffe women’s “apologetic timidity” when speaking. Though the Civics Club dissolved in 1921 with the passage of the 19th Amendment, the outspoken, confident, and socially conscious women who came out of it suggest that Wambaugh’s wish may, at least in part, have been realized.

It begins in my small town of Chelsea, Mich., in 2016. In the span of three years, my high school, with a student body of just under 900, endured the losses of three teenagers — one a student-athlete — to mental illness.
At the time, I didn’t want to understand this kind of pain. I was known amongst my high school peers as positive, hardworking, and happy. I couldn’t distinguish stress from anxiety, sadness from depression, or “being down” from disease. I believed my relentless optimism and mental fortitude could get me through anything. I believed I was immune to mental illness.
Just before I arrived at Harvard to begin my freshman hockey season, I learned that my new Crimson team would have to compete without one of its top forwards, Ty Pelton-Byce. Pelton-Byce was forced to take a year-long leave of absence from Harvard after his battle with depression left him unable to maintain his academic eligibility. Mental illness continued to recur in my life; I continued to believe that I was immune.
In 2013, Brian Hainline, chief medical officer of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, declared mental health to be the number one health and safety concern for student-athletes. Harvard, fielding 42 varsity teams, boasts the largest Division-I athletics program in the nation. Representing almost 17 percent of the undergraduate student body, 1,075 athletes suited up for the Crimson last year. And though mental health literacy continues to improve, for athletes at Harvard, a stigma remains.
My name is Derek Schaedig. I am a goalie for the men’s hockey team at Harvard; I am a sophomore studying Psychology; I am a writer for The Crimson; and in April 2019, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, more commonly referred to as depression. I am not immune to mental illness, and neither are many student-athletes.
***
The Hockey season comprises roughly seven of the nine months of the academic year. During the season, my morning begins at 7:30 a.m. I spend the middle portion of the day in the classroom. Then, with a few minutes set aside for lunch, at 1 p.m., I head to the rink for practice, followed by a 60-minute workout. I shower, receive treatment for physical injuries, and walk to the dining hall, where I eat dinner at around 6:45 p.m. I get back to my dorm and spend the rest of the evening catching up on homework, spending time with roommates, or getting to bed early in order to repeat the process the next day.
Though the rigors of a Division I schedule can vary from athlete to athlete, team to team, or even day to day, most student-athletes have a similarly busy daily routine.
I figured out how to manage these schedule logistics freshman year. Reconciling the academic requirements, however, was more difficult.
At freshman orientation, one of the many pamphlets I received asked: “Have you ever been in a competitive environment before?”
Of course I had. I had just finished two gap years playing an extremely competitive position in hockey against the best players my age. I had been traded between teams and cut from many others. I understood competition — or so I thought.
And yet, I was unprepared for a “competitive environment” as defined by Harvard. I studied for my first midterm rigorously. A week later, I received a 56 percent. For the following test, I was determined to redeem myself: I prepared even more diligently. This time, I received a 78 percent. I had never gotten below an B+ in my life. I was stunned.
I soon realized that everyone on campus was talented in one way or another, and that meant some students on campus were better than I was in different ways. While I spent a majority of my youth pursuing the sport I love, my new peers had been intensely preparing to excel in other arenas. This culture, combined with my demanding hockey schedule, left me — for the first time in my life — consistently failing.
Away from the classroom, I was competing to earn the position of starting goaltender for my team; however, my two upperclassmen goalie partners routinely outplayed me on the ice. I was now a third-string goaltender — another foreign position for me. I was expending immense amounts of energy and focus 12 hours a day in both the classroom and on the ice, and losing on both fronts.
Even now, this experience is difficult to articulate. At the time, with far less understanding of my symptoms, I simply felt terrified.
This feeling became a living, breathing nemesis. It consumed me; it replaced all emotions. It fought continuously to dampen my love for friends, family, school, and hockey.
I began to distance myself from both my teammates and my peers. I wanted to make new friends and experience everything college has to offer, but something in my mind seemed to relentlessly urge me not to. A battle was constantly being waged in my head — my outgoing, happy, positive self versus depression — and the former always lost.
***
My breaking point came with a few months remaining in the academic year. I skipped class for the third day in a row, unable to get out of bed, fighting an illness I wasn’t yet aware I had. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I was overwhelmed with fear. I felt hopeless. It seemed like there was no overcoming the monster in my mind.
For months, I had thrown every ounce of positivity I had in me at depression. I could escape it at times, but the disease was always waiting to pull me back into its grip. The only things that fended it off were isolation at times, playing guitar at others, and alcohol.
I drank with friends, at parties, and at dances — normal college kid stuff. But after all the laughter, lights, excitement, and people were gone, when no one was looking, I still drank, and no one knew. As I continued to spiral, I started to eat poorly. Then, I stopped eating altogether. At night, I wasn’t able to sleep, and sometimes, when the sun finally did rise, I could no longer work up the motivation to get out of bed.
The night I reached my breaking point, I left my dorm around 11 p.m., and I ran. I sprinted along the Charles River with no destination in particular. I just needed to be away. Around 1 a.m., I found myself hunched over on a bench, with tears streaming down my face and a brain plagued with suicidal thoughts.
After multiple attempts from my parents persuading me to reach out for help, I called Urgent Care, and began the process of finding the support I so desperately needed.
But one phone call isn’t an immediate solution. The process of recovery is long and difficult. Though my healing process had started, I continued to struggle.
One night toward the end of the hockey season, about a month after I first contacted Urgent Care, my head coach, Ted Donato ’91, made a comment that might have saved my life. Following a game, he reminded us that we were short a great player and teammate in Pelton-Byce due to mental illness. He urged us to reach out for help if we needed it and to prioritize our mental health.
Prior to this conversation, mental health was simply not a topic of discussion on my team. My coach’s words gave me the comfort and courage I needed in order to bring my personal experience to his attention. His supportive response spurred a new stage in my healing process. I could finally acknowledge that I was not immune to depression.
***
Throughout the season, my seven fellow freshman hockey class members tried to lift my spirits. I knew they could tell I was down; I also knew they did not know why. At our end-of-year celebratory dinner, flanked by shouting waiters and sizzling entrees, I cautiously revealed my diagnosis to them. It was received with nothing but love and support, a reaction for which I am eternally grateful for and believe exemplifies my teammates’ outstanding character.
Since then, others on my team have come forward with similar experiences. One of my teammates described depression to me as an “invisible disease,” impossible to reckon with “until you’ve experienced it and realize just how real and daunting it truly is.”
Untreated mental illness is not a phenomenon limited to men’s hockey. I spoke to eight athletes from a range of Harvard teams who shared stories like mine.
“It can be hard to admit to yourself,” said a man on the soccer team. “It seems like something that happens to other people, but not you.” Others cited similar experiences struggling with depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and other mental illnesses.
These athletes agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because of a stigma in athletics at Harvard that brands those who acknowledge their mental illness as weak. One women’s hockey player told me she “felt like I wasn’t allowed to feel this way, because on paper, my life was supposed to be perfect.”
***
There is still work necessary to improve access to mental health resources, reduce the stigma associated with mental illness, and boost overall awareness of the issue. Some of it is being done through new programs such as the NCAA’s Mental Health Task Force and Harvard’s Crimson Mind and Body Program, as both the NCAA and Harvard make drastic strides in their support for student-athletes’ mental health needs.
Depression, anxiety, various eating disorders, and other mental illnesses can affect anyone. They don’t care about social status, height, weight, gender, age, race, athletic ability, and academic accomplishments. They hide behind smiles and within our community. They are unnoticed in public, yet devastating in private. They are the ultimate equalizer.
If you are reading this and battling a mental illness, I want you to know that there is help for you, and it begins with talking to others about your disease.
I am currently taking a leave of absence from both school and hockey in order to continue to focus on my mental health. But through hard work, perseverance, and the services of Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services, Oaklawn Hospital, McLean Hospital, and The University of Michigan, I will continue to battle my invisible disease, and I will return even stronger and healthier than before.
This is where my story ends, but my battle with mental illness forges on. The same goes for the other student-athletes in this story and the thousands of other students — athletes or not — across the nation who also struggle with mental illness. We have many more tests to take, goals to score, championships to win, and long, full, happy lives to live. We continue to battle our mental health disorders daily, but we are fighters, and we refuse to let our diseases stop us from chasing our dreams.

As an astrophysicist, environmental activist, and now a candidate for Cambridge City Council, Derek A. Kopon finds inspiration at the intersections.
When asked how his career in astrophysics relates with his campaign for city council, Kopon pauses before answering, “Astrophysicists fall in one of two categories, you're usually either an observer or a theorist… You need those two people need to come together and actually have a meeting of minds and see if the theory matches reality.” Kopon believes that this same merging is necessary when dealing with complicated policy initiatives.
Kopon is currently an astrophysicist and engineer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. After graduating from Cornell with both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in engineering physics, he joined the aerospace industry. He was involved in producing telescopes for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, as well as engineering predator drones for the U.S. defense industry. However, he stopped when he realized that the technologies he was developing were being used in the Iraq War.
“That was probably a war that shouldn't be fought,” he states. “And so around 2006, 2007, I really started looking for things that I could do with my expertise that were not related to defense.”
Kopon pivoted back to astronomy, pursuing a graduate degree at the University of Arizona and then working as a postdoc in Germany. In 2015, he moved to Cambridge to work at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and “scraped together” his life savings to buy a condo.
Recently, Kopon became aware of an affordable housing overlay proposal drafted by the city council, aimed to help affordable housing developers create new units more efficiently. After looking into the proposal, he found that he disagreed with on many points.
As he starts to enumerate his issues with this proposal — including its rushed timeline, negative environmental impact, zoning issues, and the lack of evidence supporting it — Kopon pauses abruptly. Frustration is palpable in his voice as he explains, “I'm trying to think for a minute because it's hard to know that there are so many bad aspects of this policy.”
This issue is personal to Kopon: He hopes to raise a family in Cambridge, and he believes that this policy will adversely impact his family and families around him. He talks passionately about how it will affect his elderly neighbors, many of whom have lived in Cambridge for several decades. To understand the origins of this policy, he decided to start attending city council meetings, and soon decided to run for council himself.
Though Kopon says that his decision to run for city council was unexpected, he smiles with pride as he talks about his campaign, noting that the highest percentage of his campaign contributions are donations under $200. All of his donations have been from Cambridge residents, other than his Uncle Tommy from Colorado and a friend from college.
His scientific career has strongly influenced his political aspirations, with environmental policy being one of the cornerstones of his platform. At Cornell, he was involved in environmental activism groups, and he is a strong advocate of solar energy. He calls for mandatory solar power on all new developments in contrast to other candidates who are calling for just “solar-ready” developments.
He supports his stance by saying, “Other cities have already done this. Watertown already has a mandatory solar ordinance and that's something where I think Cambridge should have been a leader.”
Despite his concerns, Kopon is very optimistic about the future of the council and the city. While walking back to Harvard Square, Kopon points out yard signs for various candidates that he knows and respects.
He reflects, “One of the things that I've learned in local politics is that you really need to show up and you really need to be in the room.”

A trash can bursts into flames outside Atlantic City’s Convention Hall. As the heat swells, an orange haze consumes bras — and the curling pages of Playboy magazine — in a plume of rising smoke and a purge of female frustration.
In protest of the 1968 Miss America Pageant, a hundred women dropped their belongings into the fire, including hair curlers and false eyelashes — anything “that smacked of ‘enslavement'’’ in the words of Charlotte Curtis for the New York Times.
Among the defiant, “Kathy Amatnick” reportedly yelled across the crowd to reprimand her elderly grandmother for engaging in a forbidden act — talking to a man. The Times reported her plea, “You mustn’t do that”!
The young woman’s actual name is Kathie Amatniek ’64 — that is, before she changed it to Sarachild in honor of her mother Sara. A key figure in the 1960s radical feminist “consciousness-raising” movement, Sarachild first discovered her knack for generating awareness on a smaller scale. Years before she established herself as a radical and influential activist, she developed another platform for herself that influenced her peers.
At Radcliffe College, she served as The Crimson’s only female editor, writing opinion pieces that one student organizer credited as “the first appearance of the anti-war movement at Harvard.”
Between film reviews and rebuttals to The Harvard Review, Sarachild published a series of articles on America’s continued military presence in Vietnam. From 1962 to 1963, she commented on America’s strategies to overwhelm the Viet Cong and their struggles to intercept guerilla propaganda in South Vietnam.
In her article “Cambridge ADA Gives Screening Of Vietnam Film,” the nondescript title belies the fluidity with which Sarachild conveys her beliefs on the overbearing presence of America abroad.
“The film illustrates much that U.S. newspapers have described,” she writes. “Barbed wire-enclosed strategic hamlets, American tanks rolling down American-built strategic highways, American pilots bombing Vietnamese villages; American soldiers leading Vietnamese troops.”
The movie focuses on South Vietnamese guerillas’ struggle against American imperialism and Sarachild forces her readers to acknowledge this. Her persistent written references of distinctly “American” tanks and pilots and soldiers refuse to let her audience off the hook.
But this balance between subtlety and politicization does not preclude other moments of argumentative clarity in her writing. In her piece titled “GIs and Guerillas,” she declares unambiguously that “The status quo is intolerable.”
She writes that “[a]s long as the South Vietnamese must endure an autocratic government which they have had no part in choosing, the terror of civil war, and the presence of thousands of foreign (American) troops,” guerilla propaganda will remain attractive, offering “a future of economic progress and certainly no less political freedom than they presently enjoy.”
While perhaps it’s not surprising that she wrote passionately about the Vietnam war, her lack of commentary on feminism might be unexpected. After all, many cite the defining moments of her career as helping found the New York Radical Women’s group, participating in the Miss America Pageant protest, and coining the slogan “Sisterhood is Powerful,” among countless other efforts toward gender equity and female empowerment.
But Sarachild’s influence on the feminist movement wasn’t limited simply to these contributions: She expanded the limited focus of traditional 20th century feminism to include issues pertinent to women outside of a certain class or race — that is, middle-class, white housewives.
“Whatever else we may do, consciousness raising is the ongoing political work,” Sarachild said to the New York Times in a 1970 interview. As a member of the Redstockings, a feminist group founded in the 1960s, Sarachild attempted to break down “the divisions between women that keep us apart,” particularly along lines of race and class. Immediately after graduating, Sarachild worked first in Mississippi as a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee — a crucial force in the American civil rights movement.
Many years later, Sarachild’s attention to the intersection of race and gender remained integral to her conception of activism. In a 1998 letter to Betty Friedan, now maintained by the Schlesinger Library, Sarachild stresses the importance of women’s support for civil rights and civil rights activists.
“I think it would be so good if there was a strong feminist presence among those sending birthday greetings to Jim Forman,” she writes. Jim Forman was a leader of the civil rights movement, involved with the SNCC, Black Panther Party, and League of Revolutionary Black Workers. She continues, “After all, without SNCC’s spectacular courage, actions and organizing in the deep South, there would not have been a wave big enough to carry the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with the sex discrimination provision in it, over all obtacles.”
Sarachild’s role in creating anti-war and civil rights consciousnesses at and after Harvard both foreshadowed and reinforced her role in a feminist movement that focused on consciousness-raising as a method. As the title of an essay of hers proclaims, this strategy was nothing less than a “Radical Weapon.”

Do you want “to fit into that slinky velvet dress again… to show everyone you’re not so bad looking when you don’t have that roll of fat around your middle?” Or perhaps, your goal is simply “to sit down in your favorite slacks without fear of cutting blood circulation in both thighs.”
Regardless, “The Harvard Square Diet,” a 1987 book written by Frederick J. Stare, the founder of Harvard’s Department of Nutrition, and Elizabeth M. Whelan, the director of The American Council on Science and Health, contains the solutions you seek. Chapters range from “Understanding the Harvard Square Diet Formula” to “Planning and Soul-Searching.” I, a student living in Harvard Square who “wouldn’t be caught dead having Jerry Football-Hero or Cindy Sleeksnob see [me] looking this way” at my five-year high school reunion, set out to squeeze the eight-week long diet into just five days, in the interest of investigating this seemingly untapped facet of the Harvard brand.
Despite the title’s explicit invocation of Harvard, just seven pages into the book, the authors devote an entire “disclaimer” section to explicitly announcing that the book is in no way connected to the University. But the writers argue that the book “does have something in common with Harvard University, something that few diet books can claim to have.” Like Harvard, this book’s motto is “veritas.” This is the first lesson I learn on this diet — “truth” evidently means eating one chicken parm sandwich instead of two.
To mentally prepare for my five days of “girth control,” I turn to chapter three, “Day One: Planning and Soul-Searching.” The book highly recommends seven days of preparation but concedes that “if you are impatient, of course you can do all this in one day and start tomorrow.” Overcome with excitement for and impatience about beginning my Harvard Square diet — plus a deadline hanging over my head — I did exactly that.
Like many diets, this one requires its disciples to limit caloric intake, choose healthier options, and exercise. The book doesn’t ask me to “cut out” anything from my diet but, rather, “cut back.” No more popcorn chicken bowls as a side dish.
I start day one by following the book’s suggestion of planning my meals. I stand in Annenberg and visualize what a half-portion of usual dinner would look like. As I load three-quarters of a slice of barbeque meatloaf onto my plate, I glance at the soft-serve machine in the corner of the dining hall, close my eyes, picture the cover of the book, and feel emboldened to shout, NO!
This was all easy in the moment, but a few hours after my half-dinner, I begin to consider the allure of the Twizzlers hidden under my bed. The authors did not seem to account for the ingenuity of college students when it comes to procuring late night snacks; perhaps the 1980s were a darker time for those with Twizzler habits.
Up next is the exercise portion of the diet. The authors suggest “aerobic dance” as the most effective calorie-burning option. This category includes, but is not limited to: “the hora,” “Latin dance,” and “the Irish sword dance (a somewhat refined version of the jig).” The book has obviously failed to consider the realities of living in Harvard Square surrounded by fellow Harvard students:I simply cannot perform any of these options in a public gym around people I know, and people I will maybe one day want to earn the respect of. Instead, I opt for the “Weight Watchers Pepstep Program.” Every night for five days I vigorously sprint up the five flights of Weld Hall five times, which is moderately less embarrassing than dancing a jig in a corner of the MAC.
I don’t think this diet is for me — the 1980s, it seems, were a time more conducive to spontaneous aerobic dance. At the very least, perhaps I’ll try to grab a protein bar next time I’m at CVS, instead of my usual six cups of instant ramen: my own personal Harvard Square Diet.

The site looks like any other urban archaeological dig, scattered with fluorescent red buckets and cones, dirty gloves and shovels, and a small group of volunteers poring over the six feet of excavated earth and rubble below them.
A few blocks from the historic Chinatown Gate, these archaeologists are procuring artifacts from the pits. Their voices, speaking in both Chinese and English, meld and fill the summer air. From the earth, they pull up debris dating back to 1970s Chinatown: melon candy wrappers, burnt cigarette wrappers, cassette tapes, empty soda bottles. These seemingly ordinary objects are part of an ongoing venture — the first of its kind in Boston — to uncover the history of Chinese immigrants.
***
Boston City Archaeologist Joseph M. Bagley never anticipated that he would lead the city’s first archeological dig of Chinatown. Bagley mentioned his interest in Chinatown as a potential site during a talk about urban archaeology at Boston University. He was then contacted by Tunney F. Lee, an audience member at the talk and former head of the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at MIT. Lee, who grew up in Chinatown, connected Bagley with the Chinese Historical Society of New England (CHSNE), an educational organization focused on documenting the history of Chinese immigrants. With the help of Lee and members from CHSNE, they identified a location for the dig — 6 Hudson St.
Lee remembers the buildings on Hudson St. from his own childhood. “There were three buildings there that were demolished, the dig was at number six.” He would get his hair cut right next door, at number eight.
***
The dig process began in the winter of 2018, with months of background research into records of previous 6 Hudson St. residents and permit applications. From the beginning, Bagley saw informing and including local Chinatown residents as a crucial step. Bagley and his team presented their research plans to different community groups, addressing their questions and concerns. “Showing up on the site and just digging is a very colonial thing to do,” Bagley says. They also printed stories in Sampan, New England’s only bilingual Chinese-English newspaper, “so that the people that read the newspaper at least would be able to see that we’re coming,” Bagley adds.
Beyond informing the community of the dig, Bagley wanted to ensure that the community was able to participate. So, although the team was ready to break ground in mid-April, Bagley and the CHSNE agreed to push the official start date until early July so that local Chinatown students would be able to take part in the dig. While Bagley’s team reserved volunteer spots for Chinatown residents, they had around only three to four Chinatown residents for each week. But Bagley noted that the site often attracted large groups of local spectators.
“We had a lot of residents that hang out in the park come up and having really long conversations with each other about what we were digging,” Bagley says.
***
The dig ended abruptly in late July, after a little over three weeks of excavation. The archaeologists had reached the water table, the point beyond which, no matter how far they continued to dig, water would continue to fill their trenches and impede their progress. “We'd have to literally build a dam around the site to keep the water out of it and continuously pump it out, which we just didn't have the technology or the engineering to do,” says Bagley.
They dug deep enough to be on the brink of encountering material from the 19th century — and ironically, water is beneficial for the preservation of artifacts. But Bagley and his team could not continue. They were underfunded and unable to pursue an underwater dig by hand.
Despite its abbreviated run, the archaeologists found 1,699 artifacts that Bagley calls “emblematic” of Chinatown’s rich history. From a leg of a toy dinosaur to cassette tapes illustrating the music preferences of Chinatown residents in the 1970s and 1980s, Bagley hopes that their finds can help preserve the narratives of a historically marginalized community.
Though Lee characterizes the findings as “meager,” he argues that the significance lies in conducting the dig itself. “It gives us the history of Boston in some ways, too, not just Chinatown,” he says.
However, according to Bagley, the artifacts that they found illustrate “a very distinct Chinatown” — one that illuminates the lifestyle choices of former residents. “We're still in the process of trying to squeeze out the meaning of everything,” Bagley says.
The dig also offered a sense of community engagement among Chinatown residents. “It's been really gratifying to work with the community. They understand that we’re interested in the site and the stories because they're being underrepresented,” Bagley says. He notes that the dig wasn’t focused on the “old dead white guys” who are “heavily saturated in the historic record.”
Performing a dig in Chinatown does not uncover new stories, Bagley says. Instead, it creates new precedents to tell existing stories, ones that are often overlooked. This dig is one of many that Bagley hopes to undertake to shine light on underrepresented communities; others include digs that focus on the stories of African American, Native American, and LGBTQ communities in Boston.
The soil that couldn’t be explored by this dig in Chinatown holds stories of Syrian and Irish diasporas, the stories of other Bostonians. To Bagley, pursuing these layered histories through archaeology provides “a more complex version of time.”

“Raise your hand if you don’t believe in the supernatural.”
Our tour guide, John, glanced around our group, as if looking for a challenge. Around 20 people had assembled in front of the Harvard COOP, swaddled in enough layers to make spending 90 minutes in the cold bearable. John, dressed in a purple doublet, leather shoes, and tricorn hat, stood out. He looked like he could’ve been an apparition from the 1700s himself.
Standing in the back, next to two adult tourists from Michigan, I tentatively raised my hand. I was the only one.
“Nobody?” He sounded genuinely surprised. Maybe it was just as well that he hadn’t seen me. I surveyed the people around me, visitors from as far away as California and as nearby as Cambridge. Most were older than me, though there were a few young-looking couples.
In October and November, Thursday through Sunday, Boston Historical Tours offers a Harvard Square Ghost Tour. This is just one of almost two dozen tours that the company offers with the goal of enlivening colonial history. All of the tours, which take place throughout the Boston area, are led by actors in period-appropriate costumes. As the tour circles Harvard Square, guests are entertained with history of the area, tales of ghost sightings, and true crime stories. The tour doesn’t guarantee spiritual encounters, though it does promise to “entertain and perhaps freak you out.” And so, on a chilly Thursday night, I went to see if it would make me into a believer.
For those looking for standard scary stories, the tour does not disappoint. Harvard, as it turns out, is not short on the macabre; people have been dismembered, bludgeoned to death, and suffered otherwise tragic and untimely deaths. Though creepy, the anecdotes won’t keep you up at night. There seemed to be an awareness among tour-goers that it was, at the end of the day, just a performance — stories were greeted with exclamations of, “that was really good!”, and from less enthused patrons, “so dramatic.”
Still, there were some stories that seemed to strike a nerve. Almost three centuries ago, three slaves in Cambridge, Phillis, Phoebe, and Mark, were sentenced to death for the murder of their master, John Codman. One was sent to the West Indies to live a short, brutal life on a sugar plantation; another was burned at the stake; the last was hanged, tarred, and left on a post for so many years that his body became a local landmark.
This story was greeted with silence. I looked around at the group; their faces, illuminated in the multicolored string lights of Winthrop Square, were tilted down, as if in shame. Behind us stood Peet’s Coffee, the site of the jail where Phillis, Phoebe, and Mark had been held. Inside, the baristas were starting to close down for the night, and a few remaining patrons typed at their laptops.
A five minute walk from the Square is Cambridge Commons, the site of many executions in colonial times. Elizabeth Kendall, an immigrant from Ireland, was hanged there in the mid-seventeenth century. Her crime? She had been speaking a foreign language — Irish — in public: a sure sign that she was a witch.
Occasionally, Harvard itself seemed to be counted among the unsavory spirits on the tour. Initially, John warned us that we were unlikely to see anything freaky. He cracked that if we saw, for example, ectoplasmic slime, “it might have come from the incoming freshman class.” When we passed a row of final clubs, which the tour guide said were born from the outlawing of fraternities on campus, he joked, “Can we have a moment of silence for the fact that Harvard considered Greek life too exclusive?”
We ended our tour at the Old Burial Ground, between First Parish Church and Massachusetts Ave., an ideal spot to hear a scary story. We huddled together among the gravestones as John regaled us with the tale of a ghost sighting that had reportedly occurred there only a few years earlier. Above us, the brittle leaves of oak trees cracked and fell, rustling in the wind. I realized that it had become so dark that I could barely make out the expressions of my groupmates around me.
Despite my reservations about the existence of ghosts, I began to feel a genuine chill creep up my spine. Then again, I could have just been standing in the cold for too long. Either way, I headed straight for the lights of Garden Street on my way out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten Harvard affiliates were elected to the National Academy of Medicine — a nonprofit organization that provides advice on issues related to medicine and health policy — last Monday.
The affiliates, who account for a tenth of the Academy’s newly elected members, were recognized for their demonstration of “outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service,” according to the Academy’s press release.
The faculty members — who are affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT — are Anthony P. Adamis, Elizabeth C. Engle, Tejal K. Gandhi, Daphne A. Haas-Kogan ’86, Scott L. Rauch, Peter L. Slavin ’79, Benjamin D. Sommers, Beth Stevens, Mehmet Toner, and Catherine J. Wu ’88.
Though National Academy of Medicine President Victor J. Dzau was not immediately available for comment, he spoke to the significance of being elected to the Academy in the press release.
“These newly elected members represent the most exceptional scholars and leaders whose remarkable work has advanced science, medicine, and health in the U.S. and around the globe,” he said.
Upon hearing of her election, Haas-Kogan, a professor of radiation oncology at the Medical School, said she was initially shocked but later felt grateful for the recognition.
“I have to confess I feel very undeserving and really feel that I owe it to all the people who have been on all my various teams throughout my career,” she said.
Sommers, a professor of health policy and economics at the School of Public Health, said he does not foresee that his election to the Academy will change his work’s focus on improving access to quality healthcare.
“That remains my priority,” he said. “But it does give a sense of recognition that the work that I and my colleagues have been doing has value.”
“It is further motivation to keep doing this sort of research,” he added.
Toner, a professor of surgery at the Medical School, said he feels his election to the Academy gives him a “bigger platform” to address medicine’s most pressing issues.
“This is not just a simple accolade that you collect, but it also comes with responsibilities,” he said.
Wu, chief of the Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapies at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said the election of nine of her fellow Harvard faculty members to the Academy is both unsurprising and a testament to the pioneering work of the Harvard community.
“It just speaks to the breadth of work that we as a community undertake,” Wu said. “We are truly in a vibrant community of scholars and scientists and physicians who have a deep passion and vision for how we want to make things better for our patients.”
Adamis, an ophthalmology lecturer at the Medical School, was elected to the Academy for his co-discovery of a growth factor that contributes to eye disease. His team’s previous work involving this growth factor also won them the 2014 Champalimaud Vision Award, a prestigious award in the field of vision science.
Adamis said his career achievements largely stem from work that originated at Harvard.
“It was all the opportunities I had there as a faculty member, to have protected time to do research for what I wanted to do,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brown University Physics professor Sylvester J. Gates, Jr. described how scientists found evidence for Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity in a talk at Harvard Wednesday evening.
The conversation — which was moderated by Harvard physics graduate student Delilah E. A. Gates — promoted the book “Proving Einstein Right,” co-authored by Sylvester Gates and novelist Cathie Pelletier. The book details the stories of seven astronomers who found evidence to support Einstein’s theory of relativity in the early 20th century.
Wednesday’s discussion marked the latest in the Harvard Science Book Talks series, a collaboration between the Harvard Division of Science, Cabot Science Library, and the Harvard Bookstore. The initiative aims to familiarize the public with recently published scientific literature.
Delilah Gates — Sylvester Gates’s daughter — opened the event by highlighting her father’s ability to simplify complex ideas into simple parts.
“I think a lot of his success is due to several qualities he has, including his creativity, his ability to break down complex subjects, and his ability to tell narratives,” she said.
Sylvester Gates said he was motivated to write his book to introduce his students and the public to the process of scientific discovery.
“This book is partly for my students,” he said. “I have been wanting for a long time to write a book where — for young people who are getting into STEM disciplines — they will be able to read about the real stories of the people who came before them.”
“The other reason why I wrote the book is because I wanted the public to have an inside view on what the life of a scientist is like,” he added.
During his talk, Gates said he aimed to humanize historical scientific researchers in his book. He explained how Charles Davidson — one of the astronomers described in the book — refused to believe in the moon landing and gawked at the mini-skirts of the 1960s.
“These are the kinds of human details that you hear about these apparent giants,” Gates said.
When asked what he hoped his students would learn from his book, Gates recounted his own feelings as a college student of wanting to measure up to the great physicists of the past. He said that future scientists should know that they have the capabilities to succeed in the field.
“I would have liked to have had a senior person that I trust come back and tell me that you can do this too, that this is your birthright to do this. This is what humans do,” Gates said. “If you let them realize their dreams, and if their dreams are about science, they do great science.”
Physics professor Melissa Franklin, who helped organize the lecture series, said she hopes the book talks will connect the public to science and scientific writing.
“More than any time, I feel that it’s wonderful that people are writing books about science, and we should celebrate that and get as many people in here as possible to read the books or at least learn about the books,” Franklin said. “Science is extremely important.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard American Literature Professor Elisa New recently launched an online English course for high school students in 29 schools nationwide as part of her larger Poetry in America initiative.
The course, offered through a partnership between Poetry in America, the Extension School, and the National Education Equity Lab, is titled “Poetry in America: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop.” The course focuses on American poets from 1850 through today, and how their writing can serve as a lens through which to view American cities. Students learn by watching video lectures and participate via quizzes and writing assignments.
New declined to comment for this story.
High school students and teachers involved with the pilot had largely enthusiastic responses to the course.
English teacher Danielle Belson of Opelousas High School in Opelousas, Louisiana noted that her students are excited by the online environment of the class.
“They are very excited about the experience of being able to video [call],” Belson said.
Belson also said he students have developed their ability to synthesize poetry from different time periods.
“The assimilation that these students are experiencing is beyond what I, or anybody, anticipated,” Belson said. “Their development and their critical thinking — I’m amazed by it.”
When asked if she thinks that students will remember the course as a significant high school experience, she said, “Yes they will, yes they will.”
At the same time, Belson voiced concerns about the accessibility of the teaching staff.
When asked if there was anything that students wanted from the course, she said, “just more communication with the professors.”
Gregory S. Spencer, the principal of the International Technology Academy, a satellite of Pontiac High School in Pontiac, Michigan, also spoke positively about the course. Spencer said he believes that University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s visit to the academy in Sept. 2018 was instrumental in creating the partnership that exists with Harvard today — a partnership that continues with this course.
Spencer said that when the Extension School contacted Spencer about recruiting students for the “Poetry in America” course, his response was, “sounds great, just from the title.”
Spencer said that he believes the course, and others like it, can be valuable to students. He said he hopes the pilot program represents a start, not an end, to Extension School courses at high schools.
“I’d love to see it continue forever, and I’d love to see it expand,” Spencer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In response to mounting pressure from a number of states to compensate student athletes, the NCAA’s top governing body voted unanimously Tuesday to allow student athletes to profit from their names, images, and likenesses.
The new policy marks a major shift from long-standing rules that prevented student athletes from any type of compensation while many NCAA member institutions earned millions of dollars from their athletics programs. The policy will impact teams from all three divisions of the NCAA, and each division must immediately begin working to ensure the schools are in complete compliance by no later than January 2021.
Harvard is a member of the NCAA’s Division I and has 42 varsity teams, the most of any Division I program in the country. Roughly 20 percent of the College’s undergraduate population play a varsity sport and are consequently subject to the NCAA's proposed changes.
The NCAA stated in a press release that it is committed to preserving the “collegiate model” for athletics and will “maintain the priorities of education and the collegiate experience to provide opportunities for student athletes success.”
“The board’s action today creates a path to enhance opportunities for student athletes while ensuring they compete against students and not professionals,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a press release.
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the Ivy League has discussed the question of student-athlete pay and will work to follow the NCAA’s new guidelines.
“In regard to the recent NCAA decision, this is a matter that we have been discussing with our Ivy League colleagues, and we will continue to work with them over the next year as new rules are implemented,” Scalise wrote.
Though student athletes will now be able to profit off their images, the NCAA still maintains that payment for anything related to athletic performance is impermissible.
Harvard athletics will continue to prioritize education when considering the question of student-athlete pay, according to Scalise.
“Here at Harvard, we believe strongly in offering athletics programming that is part of the educational experience, and is co-curricular rather than extracurricular,” he wrote. “Education has always been our priority, and that will continue.”
Last spring, Scalise said in an interview that student-athletes should not be paid at Harvard.
Madison Earle ’20, president of the Student Athlete Advisory Council, wrote in a text that the NCAA’s decision could potentially disadvantage Ivy League programs’ ability to compete against other schools.
“I personally think that the Ivy League will remain consistent and uphold its values regarding amateurism for many years to come,” she wrote. “This could be of detriment to Ivy League athletes, as other leagues in the NCAA will start to receive benefits and sponsorships, which could negatively impact the caliber of performance of the Ivy League within the NCAA.
“However, it is very difficult to predict what will happen in the next 5-10 years,” she wrote.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis, who teaches Freshman Seminar 49Y: “Amateur Athletics,” wrote in an email that the new policy is “definitely a step in the right direction by the NCAA.”
“The strict interpretation of amateurism has never been fair to students, especially lower income students,” Lewis wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several political analysts shared their perspectives on the 2020 presidential election and various candidates at the Institute of Politics Thursday in a panel discussion in the JFK Jr. Forum.
The discussion featured political experts Frank Bruni, Amy Walter, and David Axelrod – a New York Times op-ed columnist, national editor of The Cook Political, and former senior advisor to President Obama from 2009 to 2011, respectively. It was moderated by Maya Sen ’00, a professor of public policy at Harvard Kennedy School.
Though the evening kicked off with a question about the upcoming Kentucky and Missouri gubernatorial elections, the discussion quickly turned to the 2020 presidential election field. The panelists noted the emergent theme of nationalization in the race, the way in which local and state elections have become inextricable from federal politics.
Walter said the “nationalization of races” poses a problem for Demoratic candidates running for office in red states where Republican candidates align themselves with the Trump presidency, while the Democrats must run as outsiders.
“And so that's the question: Can a Democrat still win on local issues at a time when the nationalization of our politics is so intense?” Walter asked.
Walter added that Democrats appear deeply anxious about choosing a candidate that can pose a threat to Trump’s electoral chances in the general election.
“On top of all of it is the deep worry among Democrats that they're going to lose to Donald Trump,” she said.
While Walter said that Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — who is leading the polls — is a deft candidate, she said Warren has not yet captured the support of groups that currently serve as key constituencies in the Democratic party and seem to be supporting former vice president Joe Biden.
Axelrod also said he admired Warren’s campaign but had doubts as to whether her positioning herself as a “fighter” will be received well by Democrat voters who are tired of how combative Washington has become.
He also said there is a “pervasive” sense of exhaustion among American voters.
“[Warren] is a pugilist,” Axelrod said. “And the question is, at the end of the day, is the most effective message the message that says ‘I’m going to fight every day?’ Because we’re fighting every day.”
Bruni also said he did not think it would be a wise strategy for the Democratic nominee, whomever is chosen, to “fight” Donald Trump directly in the General Election.
“I feel very strongly that whoever gets the nomination should talk about Trump as little as possible, because people know what he's doing, what he's done, who he is – and what I think they want to hear is what you’re trying to fix” Bruni said.
K. Oskar Shultz ’22, an attendee at the forum, said that Axelrod’s point about national exhaustion particularly resonated with him.
“People are just tired of Trump,” Shultz said. “That’s, like, what what I feel like as well – just getting up every morning and seeing a crazy Trump tweet . . . it's just, like, exhausting.”
The panel concluded with a discussion about the impact Trump impeachment proceedings might have on the Democratic primary.
Axelrod said the impeachment might pose a difficulty for the Democratic candidates who currently serve as senators — including Warren, Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Bernie Sanders (D-Vt.), and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) — if the proceedings occur around the Iowa Caucuses Feb. 3.
“Rather than being in Iowa and campaigning, they’re going to have to be at their desks in Washington,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.) denounced Harvard’s social group sanctions as discriminatory and argued in favor of legislation protecting college students’ freedom of association during a committee hearing Wednesday.
“This right is undermined when students in single-sex organizations that are operating consistent with Title IX can be discriminated against purely because they join these organizations,” Stefanik said. “It has been deeply discouraging to see my college alma mater Harvard — which I love — institute harmful policies regarding single-sex organizations, unfairly punishing students who choose to participate in these groups.”
Stefanik’s comments came during a markup session for the College Affordability Act, a Democrat-driven reauthorization of the Higher Education Act aimed at lowering the cost of postsecondary schooling. Stefanik currently serves on the House Committee on Education and Labor, where the legislation is being proposed.
The College’s contentious sanctions — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of single-gender Greek groups and final clubs from leading extracurricular organizations, holding athletic captaincies, and receiving College endorsements for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
On Tuesday, Virginia A. Foxx (R-N.C.) — the Committee on Education and Labor’s ranking member — introduced an amendment to the College Affordability Act that aims to ensure “non-retaliation against students of single-sex social organizations.” Language in a working draft of the bill prohibits institutions that receive federal funding under the Higher Education Act from “taking any adverse action” against affiliates of single-gender social clubs on the basis of those organizations’ single-sex membership policies.
In her remarks Wednesday, Stefanik — a former Crimson editorial editor — lauded the roles that she believes single-gender clubs play to “foster leadership, promote academic achievement, and encourage civic and campus involvement through philanthropic activities.”
“This bipartisan proposal will protect students’ rights to freely associate and uphold access to the unique and supportive environments that can be fostered through these organizations,” Stefanik said.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in a statement that the College’s position is “a measured and lawful policy” that does not discriminate against any student.
“Harvard College seeks to build a community in which every student can thrive, and it does so on a foundation of shared values, including belonging, inclusion, and non-discrimination. In accordance with these values, and for more than a century, Harvard has not had a Greek-life system on campus,” Dane wrote. “Harvard should not have to change its commitment to non-discrimination and educational philosophy for outside organizations that are not aligned with our long-standing mission.”
Still in an early stage of the legislative process, the College Affordability Act is moving forward. Stefanik’s spokesperson — Madison Anderson — wrote in an email that the bill was expected to pass a committee vote on Wednesday, though the committee ultimately did not finish marking up the bill that night as planned. If the bill succeeds, Harvard may have little freedom to enforce its policies.
Recent attempts at reauthorizing the Higher Education Act have failed to draw bipartisan support. The PROSPER Act — a proposed overhaul that passed the House committee in December 2017 — threatened certain financial aid programs across the nation and contained a similar provision threatening the sanctions, provoking concern from former University President Drew G. Faust. But the Republican-drafted legislation, effectively dead after the November 2018 midterm elections, never moved to the full House or Senate for a formal vote.
Over the summer, Stefanik joined Ruben M. Gallego ’02 (D-Ariz.) and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in introducing the College Freedom of Association Act, a bill seeking to amend the Higher Education Act with a rule upholding freedom of association protections for members of single-gender organizations. This and the PROSPER Act are the consequence of a concerted lobbying effort funded in part by single-sex clubs in Cambridge.
Current legislation is not the only effort threatening to derail the College’s social group sanctions. Parallel state and federal lawsuits allege Harvard’s policies violate students’ freedom of association and constitute sex-based discrimination. A judge ruled in August that the federal challenge will move forward; the discovery phase of the litigation is expected to begin soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, the Harvard women’s rugby team (5-1) fell to Dartmouth (2-2) in the Ivy League Championship, 41-22. The Crimson beat the Big Green early on this season in September, 50-32, but the team was unable to channel that same energy in order to see a similar result this past Saturday.
“We always go into Dartmouth games knowing that they are going to be a really challenging opponent,” senior captain Robyn Beese said. “In preparation for the game, we emphasized the mental game because we knew we had the ability to beat them, but only if we were completely switched on and fully present for the entire 80 minutes of play.”
The first half consisted of steady and intense back-and-forth scoring. Dartmouth got on the board first with an early penalty kick, but Harvard responded with Cassidy Bargell’s try in the 27th minute. At the end of the first half, Dartmouth had the lead, 10-7.
“We played really well in the first half. Every set was super strong and Dartmouth was unable to break our line,” Beese said. “They only scored on lucky breaks or capitalizing on our personal mistakes, such as dropped balls.”
In the beginning of the second half, the two teams continued to score and respond. After ten minutes of back-and-forth play, and tries from Harvard players, sophomore Sofia Fella and first-year Achele Agada, the game was tied at 17-17. However, a few costly errors swung the momentum in favor of the Big Green, and Dartmouth took the lead 29-17. Harvard was unable to respond effectively and regain its previous intensity.
“The second half was really challenging mentally because it’s really difficult to keep a high level of pressure consistently,” said Beese. “Sometimes when we drop the ball, our heads can go down, and it can be difficult to recover from. The momentum shift in the second half was hard to counteract.”
Harvard senior Sarah Lipson’s try with six minutes left was not enough to bring the Crimson back into the game, and Dartmouth left the field victorious with the Ivy League trophy in hand.
However, this is not the last time these two teams will see each other this season. Harvard will have an opportunity for vengeance when the team sees Dartmouth in two weekends in the NIRA semifinals. The Crimson will focus on fixing mental errors and basic mistakes in the next couple of weeks in order to be successful.
“It is good to know that we are in control of a lot of the mistakes we made. We have a good handle on the adjustments we are going to make,” said senior captain Emily Prentice. “We just need to work on our execution. We’re focused on mitigating the small errors and turnovers, and capitalizing on the opportunities we have.”
Dartmouth won the Ivy League Championship three years in a row, from 2015-2017, but Harvard ended the Big Green’s streak with the Crimson victory last year. Though the Crimson won Ivies, Dartmouth defeated Harvard in the NIRA tournament. The Harvard-Dartmouth women’s rugby matchup has evolved into an intense, unpredictable rivalry that always presents a fierce and engaging game.

“We make each other better and we push each other. Having Dartmouth in the Ivy League with us is just not only helping our team advance, but it also helps advance Ivy League rugby in general,” said Prentice. “It’s exciting because at any given point it could go either way. It is a really special opportunity to play them multiple times a year.
The rivalry is not one out of hatred or contempt, but out of respect. These two teams continue to challenge one another, improving both teams and the game of rugby as a whole. The next matchup on Saturday, November 9, is sure to be one of intensity and ferocity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Yesterday, the NCAA delivered bombshell news that it would begin to allow players to profit off of their likenesses. Sports journalists across the country have tried to synthesize what this actually means. We even sent out our own column in order to ride the wave, written by with my fellow sports chair, Henry Zhu ‘20, and myself. We definitely did not want to miss out on this news, had to make sure we could grab a piece of the pie. We tried to answer a simple yet complex question: what does this mean for Harvard athletes? I, however, have an even better question: what does this mean for the college journalists that cover these athletes?
If these student-athletes can make some money off of their likenesses, why can’t I? Student journalists all put in time, and we work hard here at 14 Plympton Street. The building is bustling at all hours, and it is hard to see all of the intense manpower that goes unnoticed. And what do we get for all this work? Student experiences? Resume additions? Lifelong community? Yeah, sure, but I sure noticed that cash money wasn’t on that list whatsoever. Therefore, I announce that my Crimson email and my Twitter DMs listed at the bottom of this page are officially open to advertisers. Come one, come all. I’ll be able to market any product in these articles; it’s amazing that half of this stuff makes it in here anyways. I’ll slip it in just like you can easily slip into Levi’s new flex-fitting jeans! (See?) Sure, you can go after Justin Herbert to market Nike. But you also have me. My reader base includes my parents, my brothers if they have nothing to do in study hall, and maybe even more in the future. Keep an open mind.
What does this have to do with this week’s Ivy League football slate, you may ask? No clue. Let’s get to the picks.
PRINCETON VS. CORNELL
Undefeated Princeton saw its toughest test of the season this past week, winning by only one possession for the first time this season. The Tigers have shown their mortal colors in league play: they have trailed at the half in two of their three Ancient Eight matchups and they allowed points to Brown. Clearly, this Goliath is not invincible.
Fortunately for Princeton, this week’s matchup comes against Cornell. Two weeks ago, I picked the Big Red to top a previously winless Colgate in an upstate New York showdown. The Raiders got its first win in its previous 10 contests. Cornell then played Brown, where I posited that the Colgate game was just a fluke. The Big Red couldn’t possibly drop a game to the lowly Bears. Well, the impossible happened. Cornell only won on a game-winning field goal that clanked off the left post, sealing the game by mere inches. Beating Brown on a game-winning field goal is about as low as a team can go, since losing is basically against the laws of nature. Princeton shouldn’t have much trouble.
Princeton by 24.
COLUMBIA VS. YALE
Neither of these two teams have played particularly well as of late. Last week, the pair of defenses combined for an even 100 points allowed. While Yale actually won its contest, Columbia understandably allowed its 59 points to the red-hot Dartmouth. The Bulldogs, on the other hand, gave up a head-scratching 41 points to Penn, who has not yet secured its first conference victory. Yale has now given up more than 40 points in two of its last three contests.
This week, the Lions will be heading up to New Haven for what could be a close matchup with the Bulldogs. This trip is possibly very familiar for some of New York’s finest, as reports surfaced this week that Big Apple Mayor and former presidential hopeful Bill DeBlasio used a police detail to chauffeur his son to and from school at Yale. I would possibly pick Columbia if I knew that the team had an NYPD escort. These reports could not be confirmed.
Yale by 3.
BROWN VS. PENN
Brown is in an interesting situation once again this week: for the second straight week, both teams in the Bears’ contest will be winless in conference play. This is a unique situation that is sure to never occur again during this season, as these two squads are the last two winless teams in the Ivy League. For the rest of the season, however, I would bet that Brown will play in a game in which at least one of the teams does not have an Ancient Eight victory.
Penn by 14.
DARTMOUTH VS. HARVARD
In a tough stretch of the season, Harvard follows up playing the ranked, undefeated Princeton with a matchup against the ranked, undefeated Dartmouth. While the Tigers has not lost since 2017, the Big Green may be the new best team in the conference. Dartmouth hasn’t seemed to have any difficulty the past few weeks, and the Big Green Defensive MachineTM has been aided recently by a high-powered offense that has topped 40 points in three straight weeks.
Harvard, however, has not yet lost at home this season, and played Princeton closer than any team this season. This game is far from over, and Dartmouth would be foolish to look ahead to next week’s matchup with Princeton in Yankee Stadium. Although I’m sure it’s exciting even a week away for New Yorkers, as the baseball venue has been mostly empty for some time now. With my Cubbies out, I'm pulling for the underdog. Go Nats.

Friday marks the end of a difficult waiting period for a select few college hockey teams. While the rest of the NCAA eagerly kicked off the schedule in mid-October, six Ivy League squads looked on from afar. Only this weekend do these storied colleges embark on their 2019-2020 campaigns.
In Cambridge, the Bright-Landry Hockey Center is on the eve of its annual winter-time festivities, as No. 19 Harvard opens the season at home against Dartmouth on Friday.
“It feels like we’ve been practicing forever,” Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think the guys are excited to get started and be part of the college hockey party, if you will, that has already started.”
Before the Crimson commences its five-month marathon, here is a look back at the recent campaign and a glimpse into the season ahead.
BACK TO THE DANCE
Last season, the Crimson returned to the NCAA Tournament after 2017-2018 marked its only hiatus from national postseason contention in the past half-decade. A talented freshman class assimilated quickly to college hockey and helped the program establish an identity in the era following Ryan Donato’s early departure for the National Hockey League. The former standout — also the eldest son of the Harvard bench boss — commanded a great deal of attention as the team’s offensive centerpiece during his final collegiate campaign. So, his absence heading into 2018-2019 required that the Crimson reinvent its offensive approach and replace Donato’s production.
And the group was up to the challenge. Harvard rode timely goaltending, the country’s second-best powerplay (28.3%), a precocious young core, and one of the nation’s elite defensemen in Adam Fox (9–39—48) en route to a 19-11-3 record (13-7-2 ECAC), a four-win improvement over the prior season.
After a lackluster start to the year, the team had to earn its way back into the national rankings, from which it dropped in November 2017. For the first time in nearly eight decades, the team opened its schedule without a win through four regular-season games. While the Crimson had no problem scoring, team defense needed improvement.
Luckily for coach Donato’s group, by mid-November goaltender Michael Lackey ’19 (14-8-3, 2.34 GAA, .918 SV%) found his groove and propelled Harvard to some of its most impressive victories of the season: a Thanksgiving-weekend win over then-No. 15 Cornell — at Madison Square Garden, no less — and a mid-January triumph against then-No. 6 Quinnipiac.
After its victory in Manhattan, the Crimson battled to a top-10 winning percentage nationwide (.660) for the rest of the season. Harvard earned a first-round bye in the ECAC playoffs before sweeping Dartmouth in a quarterfinal series, only to bow out to a ranked Clarkson squad in the conference semifinals.
Despite the loss, the Crimson became just the third program in the last decade to reach the ECAC semifinals in five consecutive seasons. More importantly, the defeat did not cost the team a bid to the NCAA Tournament: Harvard’s Pairwise ranking earned it a No. 4 seed in the Northeast Regional of the national bracket.
The Crimson’s run ended there, however, as one-seed Massachusetts knocked off its in-state foe in the round of 16. But overall, last season successfully reinstated Harvard’s place in the national conversation and provided key takeaways off of which a young team will look to build this year.
“A big thing that we kind of got up and down with was just consistency, and maturity, too,” junior defenseman Reilly Walsh said. “It’s very important to regain control of the locker room. That’s going to be very important with a young group, understanding that we’re going to be down in some games…. Limiting our skids and inconsistencies is going to be very important.”
THE DEPARTED
The loss of key players to graduation is a reality for any college hockey program. The good ones find a way to replenish previous talent, as the Crimson did last year. Nevertheless, the team surely will feel the voids left by former co-captains Lewis Zerter-Gossage ’19 and Michael Floodstrand ’19, as well as ex-backstop Lackey. Harvard also watched its bottom defensive pair, comprised of Jacob Olson ’19 and Adam Baughman ’19, walk the stage after last season.
Zerter-Gossage is cutting his teeth in the NHL’s New York Rangers organization, and Floodstrand is playing in France’s second-level league, which he currently leads in scoring. Lackey availed himself of his final year of NCAA eligibility — courtesy of a missed sophomore season at Harvard due to double hip surgery — and transferred to Providence, where he is tending the crease for a formidable squad capable of reaching the Frozen Four.
The challenge of roster turnover, however, escalated to a completely new level over the summer. In May, Fox announced his intention to forego his senior campaign and sign with the New York Rangers. The offensive defenseman played a crucial role in the team’s success from the moment he arrived on campus, distinguishing himself from nearly all of college hockey with his on-ice vision, facilitating ability, and powerplay mastery.
Fox’s accolades speak for themselves: in three varsity campaigns, he amassed 116 points (22–94—116) en route to three consecutive CCM/AHCA First Team All-America designations and a Hobey Baker Hat Trick nomination, among multiple conference and regional awards. The blue-liner’s 1.45 points per game paced the nation in 2018-2019, and it is scarcely hyperbole to suggest that Fox would have been the pre-season favorite for the Hobey Baker Award this season.
“The reality is that Adam Fox was a player for the ages as far as what he produced and what he did on the powerplay and...5-on-5,” coach Donato lauded. “We’re happy for him where he’s at, but we think that there’s a lot of talent [here]. We just have to figure out which pieces fit where.”
As if the departures of the Crimson’s seniors and most talented player were not daunting enough, Fox’s fellow classmate and rearguard John Marino inked an entry-level deal with the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins in early August. Since his freshman season, the two-way defenseman played the toughest minutes for Harvard, routinely tasked with shutting down the NCAA’s top forwards.
Both Fox and Marino saw their draft rights traded in the off-season, providing the opportunity for a more attractive NHL destination. Fox gets to don the sweater of his childhood team, while Marino joins a prestigious organization with a need for defensive depth. The two blue-liners are playing immediately with their organizations’ “big clubs.”
Despite the reality of occasionally bidding marquee players a premature farewell, a healthy representation of Crimson icemen in professional hockey is a positive for the Harvard program’s national relevance and future recruiting.
“I’m more concerned that they challenge themselves academically, that they are people of character...and take advantage of everything that a place like Harvard has to offer,” said coach Donato about players leaving early for the professional ranks. “If an opportunity comes for them to get started on their dream job, then in some ways they’re not all that different than another Harvard student.”
Fox’s and Marino’s on-ice contributions are easiest to focus on. But their graduation to the next level also has ramifications for the Crimson off the ice, particularly in the leadership department. In mid-April, the program named a trio of captains, which included both pivotal blue-liners, for the upcoming season. Now, only Nathan Krusko remains, and he will be the first sole letter-wearer Harvard has seen since Dan Ford ’14.
A major question of the Crimson’s 2019-2020 campaign, especially early on, is how the team will fill the voids left by these departures. Harvard must restock four of its top six defensemen, replace its leading goal-scorer from a year ago in Zerter-Gossage, and preserve an element of toughness in a rugged ECAC without Baughman, Marino, and Olson to dole out much of the physicality. Replacing Fox will necessarily be a team effort, and Floodstrand’s passionate leadership will be missed — though Krusko has impressed early on by embracing the position.
Notably, this challenge is all too familiar for coach Donato and his squad. With talented players joining and leaving the program each year, seemingly every preseason is subject to the same trope: “Will Harvard be able to replace its departures?” In recent memory, Hobey Baker winner Jimmy Vesey ’16 and two-time captain Kyle Criscuolo ’16 appeared difficult to replace; yet, the Crimson reached the Frozen Four in its first campaign without them. Last season was another indication that Harvard should be taken seriously regardless of who departs the program over the summer.
“[Losing players] just opens up opportunities for guys that are here,” coach Donato said. “It’s challenging from a team dynamic because there’s a lot of unknown, but it’s also exciting…. The challenge for us is to really show improvement throughout the year and try to get an identity.”
FRESH BLOOD
An influx of skilled freshmen was a primary factor allowing last year’s group to deal with — and even improve upon — the production lost to graduation and NHL departures over the summer.
For the 2019-2020 iteration of the Crimson, the story could very well be the same. Harvard welcomes seven first-years, many of whom will make the opening-night roster set to clash with Dartmouth.
Up front, Slate Hill, N.Y. native Nick Abruzzese has been slotted into the top six. The Toronto Maple Leafs draft pick led the United States Hockey League in scoring last year (29–51—80) and has impressed in the preseason with his offensive touch and creativity. Abruzzese, a small but shifty winger, is shaping up to be a major contributor to the team’s production this season.
Fellow rookie forward John Farinacci, an Arizona Coyotes prospect, will also assume a large offensive role this year. Slotted on the wing in most preseason lines, he can provide versatility down the middle for coach Donato — his uncle — as a natural center.
“I think as a whole, the guys we brought in, we’re not going to have an issue...on offense. I think we'll score goals,” senior goaltender Cameron Gornet said. “Specifically for Farinacci and Abruzzese, I wish them the best of luck. I think they’re both great, and I think they’ll do really well this year.”
The third forward in the class of 2023 is also an NHL prospect. Austin Wong, a Winnipeg Jets selection in 2018, will add an element of two-way grit to a Crimson team that generally will be smaller and quicker than most ECAC groups. Due to injury, however, the team will have to wait on Wong’s contribution until sometime after the new year.
On the back end, Harvard returns just two of its top six skaters from one of college hockey’s most experienced blue lines in 2018-2019. So, freshmen will have the opportunity to play meaningful minutes right away.
One prime example is Henry Thrun, a left-shot, two-way defenseman and Anaheim Ducks selection. The U.S. National Team Development Program product is a logical fit with Walsh, the Crimson’s most seasoned rearguard and a right-shot, offensive-minded player.
Two other first-years should join Thrun in the top six this season. Southlake, Tex. native Jace Foskey and Madison, N.J. product Ryan Siedem will provide valuable right-hand shots to a blue line that lost two impact skaters on that side. Foskey sustained an injury in preseason practice and will not suit up on opening night, potentially thrusting Siedem into a top-four role as Foskey continues his recovery.
The seventh player rounding out the freshman class is goaltender Mitchell Gibson. A 2018 selection of the Washington Capitals, Gibson should at the very least provide healthy competition for Gornet and may even contend for starts this season.
Gornet is the most senior returner in the crease and provided crucial net-minding (5-3-0, 2.56 GAA, .915 SV%) late last year during Harvard’s run to the NCAA Tournament. On top of these reasons, the St. Louis, Mo. native’s preseason has impressed enough that he will man the starting crease against the Big Green on Friday. That said, Gibson will vie for Gornet’s role throughout the year, making for an interesting goalie battle moving forward.
“We owe it to the team to have a competition for every spot, including the goaltending position,” coach Donato said. “Cam [Gornet] went in and played well last year and was certainly excited about the way he responded when he got his opportunity last year…. I do think Cam deserves the first opportunity to start against Dartmouth.”
STILL HERE
Of course, new additions are just one key element in the Crimson’s quest for success this season. Most Harvard icemen return to the team with added experience from the 2018-2019 run to the national tournament as well as a summer of training. Their progression, both on the ice and in the locker room, is as critical to the squad as the incoming talent.
The contributions of the class of 2022 marked a defining feature of last season’s success. Forwards Jack Drury and Casey Dornbach return as sophomores looking to set the tone offensively for the Crimson. Drury (9–15—26) blossomed as a leader and point-producer in his freshman campaign, as effective on the faceoff dot as he was on the powerplay.
Dornbach (7–22—29) entered his rookie year as more of a dark horse, not an NHL draft pick like his linemate Drury. That did not stop him from earning ECAC Rookie of the Year honors and a seat among the top five freshmen scorers in the NCAA. These two sophomores should anchor Harvard’s top forward trio for most of this season, and their early pairing with Abruzzese could form one of the ECAC’s most lethal lines.
“Both [Drury and Abruzzese] are special players, and we have some chemistry on the ice,” Dornbach said of his linemates days after an Oct. 19 exhibition at Dartmouth. “But our chemistry off [the ice], and our communication habits, are what are going to allow us to succeed when things aren’t going well…. I think we have a lot of potential, but now it’s time to put the work in.”
Juniors Henry Bowlby and Jack Badini were positive additions upon arrival two seasons ago and will be asked to take another step in terms of both leadership and production in 2019-2020. Last year, Bowlby (5–8—13) potted multiple big-time goals and demonstrated his ability to spark the offense. Badini (8–12—20) leveraged his speed and strength to put forth streaks of dominance as a sophomore but, like his classmate Bowlby, struggled with consistency.
Badini commanded the circles last season, posting the second-best faceoff percentage in Division I (66.0%). He is a crucial piece in providing coach Donato with a surplus of effective options at center ice along with Drury, Farinacci, sophomore Baker Shore (2–11—13), and senior Frédéric Grégoire (6–9—15).
“We feel that good teams are built through the middle of the ice with good defense and good center icemen,” coach Donato said. “I think we have some of those pieces in place, but we’re going to have to really take a big step.”
Between these important pieces and the injection of multiple skilled freshmen up front, the upcoming campaign promises to feature a speedy Harvard attack which, while slightly undersized, has the potential to expose its share of goaltenders.
“We always love to play fast, and especially this year if you just look at our roster we have a lot of speed and skill,” Walsh said. “One critique you might have is our size, but...something we’re going to want to establish is getting pucks in, playing very hard, moving really fast, and making other teams’ bigger, slower players play to our speed.”
On the blue line, the progression of the two most experienced returners, Walsh and sophomore Jack Rathbone, is another major development to watch heading into 2019-2020, and its bearing on team success cannot be overstated.
Both defensemen are skilled puck movers and adept skaters who, after Fox and Marino departed early for the NHL, are going to see tougher defensive assignments and even more minutes this season. This additional workload could be especially pronounced early in the year, as expected top-six blue-liners heal and freshmen acclimate to the college game.
Through the first half of his NCAA career, Walsh has racked up 51 points (19–31—51) and garnered accolades such as a Third Team All-ECAC nomination and a spot on the ECAC All-Rookie Team. Last season (12–19—31), the New Jersey Devils prospect logged nearly a point per game (0.94) — good for eighth among NCAA defensemen — and played a vital role on the team’s powerplay, offering a potent slapshot from the point.
In 2018-2019, Rathbone put forth a promising first season in the crimson and white. The 2017 Vancouver Canucks selection (7–15—22) ranked third in the NCAA among first-year rearguards in points per game (0.67), and his performance earned him a conference all-freshman designation.
At even strength, coach Donato likely will task Walsh and Rathbone each with commanding his own pairing alongside a freshman as the team looks to address the defensive depth it lost over the summer. Sophomore Marshall Rifai, who went pointless in six appearances last season, is expected to round out the top six alongside first-years Thrun, Foskey, and Siedem when the blue line is at full health.
Thus, even with Walsh and Rathbone as elite ECAC defensemen, Harvard will ice four skaters with little to no collegiate experience on its back end this year. While center ice is an area of strength for the Crimson, the blue line has something to prove after high turnover from a season ago.
“We’re a young D corps coming in, with three freshmen coming into the blue line on the top six,” Walsh said. “But we’ve got a group that’s got a lot of USHL experience and guys that are very mature players even though they might be true freshmen…. I have to have a leadership role this year, taking those guys and giving them little pointers now and then.”
NEXT MAN UP ON MAN-UP
Harvard’s returning players will collectively address one pressing question mark for this year’s squad: the powerplay. In 2018-2019, the Crimson’s man advantage was the team’s most lethal element, cashing in nearly 30 percent of the time. Until the final weeks of the season, Harvard’s powerplay was consistently the top-rated unit in the NCAA.
A large part of this success was due to Fox, whose knack for man-up quarterbacking likely will never be surpassed in a Crimson uniform. Fox, along with Zerter-Gossage, will need to be replaced on this year’s first unit. And practically speaking, replicating last season’s 28.3 percent execution rate would be difficult for any powerplay.
Harvard still has potent pieces in place on the man advantage, as Drury, Dornbach, and Walsh will remain key components of the first unit. Rathbone is a logical piece to replace Fox at the point, and judging from preseason even-strength lines and the mid-October scrimmage against Dartmouth, Abruzzese probably will fill the final slot.
With several different pieces and a new face behind the bench in Assistant Coach James Marcou, the Crimson’s man-up attack will take a slightly different form. The willingness to share the puck evenly and often — a major improvement achieved by last year’s powerplay — surely will remain a point of emphasis. But in a new era for Harvard’s man advantage, consistent 5-on-5 play is all the more paramount.
“For the most part, they’ve been playing with each other for a long time,” said Bowlby about members of the powerplay unit. “It’s just kind of adjusting to maybe a lefty there versus a righty from last year and little things like that that won’t be too hard for them as they move forward.”
UPCOMING SLATE
The opening portion of the Crimson’s schedule is eerily similar to last year’s. The team battles Dartmouth to kick off the season, only this time it hosts rather than visits the Big Green. Then, the group welcomes Princeton and now-No. 9 Quinnipiac, travel partners who tripped to Cambridge on the second weekend of last season as well. A road weekend at Brown and Yale follows, also like 2018-2019.
This year, however, Harvard hopes to emerge from this similar start with a better record than last season’s 1-2-2. As in most other years, all five conference games are winnable due to the sheer parity found in the ECAC, though the Bobcats present the greatest challenge and most compelling measuring stick early on.
At the turn of December, the Crimson will battle two local blue chips from the Hockey East, now-No. 15 Boston College and Boston University. The pair of contests against historical Boston hockey juggernauts means that Harvard will face all three of its Beanpot rivals in 2019-2020, as it has drawn Northeastern on the first Monday of February’s annual tournament.
December is always a lighter month for the Crimson thanks to a three-week break for final exams and the holiday season, yet Harvard will have an eventful month nonetheless. Just three days after the meeting with the Terriers, coach Donato’s group will play host to now-No. 4/5 Cornell, an always formidable squad returning most key pieces from a year ago. The Crimson’s only victory over the Big Red in the past two seasons came in last year’s November turning-point game at Madison Square Garden, making Cornell one of Harvard’s most challenging foes in recent memory.
The Crimson wraps up the 2019 portion of the schedule after Christmas with a cross-country trip to Southern California, where it will faceoff twice against Arizona State at the Anaheim Ducks’ practice facility. Last season, the teams split their two-game series in Cambridge.
“We have our big games against BU and BC, and then we go to Anaheim. Those are all fun out-of-conference games,” Gornet said. “Every game is fun for me senior year, sort of my last hurrah. So I’m really looking forward to every game.”
After ringing in the new year, Harvard visits Quinnipiac for a second meeting before returning to Madison Square Garden after last January’s successful Frozen Apple outing for a marquee duel with Ivy League rival Yale.
In the back half of January, the Crimson hosts now-No. 11 Clarkson before making its annual trip to Cornell’s esteemed Lynah Rink, the source of one of college hockey’s most electric environments.
The Beanpot Tournament will, like always, demand most of the attention in the first half of February. Harvard takes on the now-No. 10 Huskies in the early game of the semifinal round, a chance to return to the tournament final the following Monday for the first time since winning the Beanpot in 2017.
Two home stands — the first featuring a visit from Yale and the second including a clash with Union — sandwich the infamous “North Country” road trip to Clarkson and St. Lawrence. These three weekends comprise the home stretch of the regular season before conference playoffs commence in early March. As always, the Crimson will be targeting a top-four finish in the ECAC to earn a first-round bye in the conference tournament.
Overall, Harvard’s 2019-2020 season will present mostly familiar challenges — replacing talented departures, integrating skilled freshmen, and battling through an ECAC characterized by parity, to name a few. This year, however, an especially young core will be given the responsibility of carrying the Crimson, making for a campaign of exciting hockey and, undoubtedly, lessons learned along the way.
