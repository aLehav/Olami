After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freddie Gray’s death was an inexcusable tragedy—the kind of  event that alone would justify mass protests and attempts at reform. Yet, sadly, little is unique about what happened last week in Baltimore. Gray is just the latest casualty of an American criminal justice, education, and economic system that breeds inequality and creates a mentality that black lives do not matter.
The citizens of Baltimore did not take to the streets in such large numbers and with such unrelenting passion because of Gray’s death alone. They protested because of what that tragedy reveals about their community, and about our country. After all, Baltimore is a microcosm of the greater racial and socioeconomic inequality that eats away at the fabric of our nation.
In the aftermath of Gray’s death and the ensuing protests, we hope to see reform not just in Baltimore, but also across our country. Policies like body cameras on police officers and better law enforcement training aimed at directly preventing episodes like Gray’s death must be coupled with programs that attack the larger problems that have led to our broken society.
In a country some refer to as post-racial, Baltimore’s black residents still earn almost $30,000 per year less on average than their white counterparts; young black men in Baltimore have a 37 percent unemployment rate (compared to 10 percent for white men of the same age); and the life expectancy of predominantly black neighborhoods like Upton and Druid Heights is 20 years lower than that of nearby white neighborhoods, such as Roland Park.
Furthermore, America remains a country where black unemployment is double that of whites, where the top 20 percent of households control over 84 percent of the nation’s wealth, and where poverty is still very much dictated by race and ethnicity.
We cannot just protest; we must act. It’s time to demand our government implement policies that target the gross racial and socioeconomic inequality that are largely responsible for what happened last week in Baltimore.
We need to listen to politicians like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who are calling on Congress to pass programs like a summer jobs initiatives to provide underprivileged young people with job opportunities. We need to pay equal attention to conservatives like Representative Paul Ryan, whose plans for addressing the vicious cycle of poverty in America center around directing resources to the communities that need them most and empowering residents of those communities to take control of their economic lives.
Regardless of which specific policies we end up deciding to pursue, Freddie Gray’s death is further evidence that the status quo is unsustainable—that it is time for reform. Until we pursue concrete changes in police training and the way wealth and opportunity are allocated in our country, we cannot be surprised when citizens take to the streets and when we lose the lives of unarmed black men like Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and whoever’s loss we will mourn tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You are about to die. You have but a few precious moments—perhaps, if you’re lucky, years—before all of your life can be described in the perfect tense. Your accomplishments are about to be finite, your expenses numerable.
Given that your resources are limited, it’s worth taking a good deal of time to think about how you will be spending them. To everyone with even a few dollars to their name, to anyone with a few minutes to spare, I would advise you to seek out what matters most in the world and then invest your time and money accordingly.
Debt. Perhaps foremost in any advice on spending is a caution against debt. Never permit your loans to restrict you more than they enable you. How you choose to spend your money should be up to you, not the bank. Freedom is a prerequisite for living a life you can be proud of.
Necessity. There’s a certain kind of money that greases the adult world (e.g. bus fares, restaurant tips, coat check). There’s a special sort of time that you have no choice but to spend (e.g. waiting in grocery lines, walking home from class, etc.). It is only to your disadvantage to begrudge the world these necessary expenditures. Yes, your long-term savings will be statistically significant, but I highly doubt it’s worth being forever known as a miser.
Luxury. It’s $12 for a bouquet of flowers and $25 for the ones that you know your boyfriend will actually enjoy. No one has ever come to the end of their life and said, “I’m so glad I didn’t get that better gift for my roommate’s birthday. There’s no way his smile would have been worth the 13 extra dollars.”
The joy of living in a first world country is that we have the means to offer frequent physical signifiers of our love. Let’s enjoy this privilege while we have it. I would apply this attitude to time as much as to money. Spend liberally. This is the price we pay for the privilege of encountering the ones we love.
Aid. In a time of crises big (Nepal, Baltimore) and small (break-ups, grad school rejections), it’s worth asking whose tragedy warrants your attention. I have yet to donate to earthquake relief efforts, not from a lack of opportunity or means but because it’s outside of my routine. I also doubt I’ve grasped the scale of the destruction to any degree. It’s insidiously easy for vastly important events to fly under our radar.
Were she living, Ayn Rand would insist that need does not entitle anyone to take what is yours. Perhaps I agree. Giving out of my abundance of resources isn’t something I consider an obligation so much as a realization of the uncountable grace God, my family, and my friends have shown to me. I encourage you to ask not what portion of your savings you owe to disaster relief but what portion you can spare in light of your blessed condition.
That Last Dollar. Giving where it counts winds up benefitting you in return. Who you spend time with when there is no time to spend speaks volumes about what matters to you most. Are you blowing off a paper to hang out with those friends of convenience who will totally check out of your life after you graduate, or are you blowing off a paper to grab coffee with the woman who will fly cross-country the next time you need a friend?
I think a lot about what it would be like to give an account for my life: Every YouTube video I watched, every hungry man and woman I walked past in the Square, every phone call with my mom. I don’t know how it would all add up. I know I could do more. We can always do more. In an effort to galvanize a species plagued by procrastination and forgetfulness, I’ll say this: Spend wisely while there’s still something left to spend. Once it’s gone, there’s no getting it back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Saturdays ago, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake ripped through Nepal, resulting in widespread damage to infrastructure, irreparable harm to historical sites, and, most tragically, the deaths of thousands and thousands of human beings.
Such an event should inspire mourning and contemplation—sorrow for the people who lost their lives and gratitude for the lives that we still have.
Instead, in the aftermath of the tremors, a different sort of behavior rose up from the rubble. News outlets ran reports of individuals—some tourists and some Nepalese citizens—stopping in front of destroyed buildings for quick selfies.
Here was one sort of earthquake response: Survey the tragic scene, take a smiling photo, and then skip off in the opposite direction.
If social media glorifies life—capturing our most intimate moments and recording our funniest jokes—then it does the opposite for death.
In Nepal, the pressure of social media gave users an incentive to turn a deep and wide human tragedy into a shallow snapshot.
To a certain degree, you can blame the photographers. A tactful person should have enough respect to avoid behavior that reduces a death into a tagged detail.
Yet a larger, and more disconcerting, criticism of the selfie-behavior that emerged out of the Nepal earthquake has to do with the nature of social media itself.
By displaying nothing more than instances of frivolity, by encouraging users to disguise themselves inside a sunny-beach persona, social media prevents the acknowledgement of deeper emotions, such as grief.
Against a background of party photos and emojis, mortality loses all of its defining gravitas. The deceased become abject and even absurd—they simply can’t coexist with this sepia-tinted world in which every comment is an inside joke.
Put it this way: There is nothing more unsettling than the Facebook profile of a dead teenager.
I think the uneasy feeling derives from the lightheartedness of the content that dominates any social media platform. There are airy “lol” comments; there are witty photo captions.
There is rarely, if ever, a reminder that this person—this very same smiling person—is fragile enough to die.
How can you reconcile social media’s giddy artificiality with death’s stone-cold reality? How can you connect a corpse to a profile picture?
I’d like to provide an answer, but I sense these questions are rhetorical—Facebook simply lacks the tools to chronicle death.
That’s why it feels slightly invasive to log onto the profile of a dead person; that’s why you wince when you read trivial comments on the same profile, knowing all the time that the commenter is no longer around to make such banal remarks.
Over the past several months, I have often described social media as a sort of illusion. There is the illusion of popularity, the illusion of philanthropy, and the illusion of substance.
In some ways, however, I think that the mortality-defying effects of social media are the most illusory and therefore the most dangerous. The more time you spend on Facebook, engaging with the social detritus of your friends, former friends, and hope-to-be friends, the more you sidestep the most central truth of your own existence.
Everyone dies one day, but on Facebook, all you can see is eternal bacchanalia and laughter.
The easiest recommendation is to unplug your life and spend more time appreciating the fragile beauty of real things. The fact that something—a season, a flower, or a person—is temporary, essentially makes that something more valuable.
But realizing that everyone, myself included, needs social media for practical life purposes, a more realistic suggestion revolves around mindfulness.
“Mindfulness”—this may sound like an empty word, but I believe that it encapsulates the overarching message that I’ve tried to drive home throughout a semester of column writing.
The Internet is powerful, practical, and practically powerful. You need to use it for these reasons.
However, you need to use the Internet well, which requires significant reflection. Think hard before you click to open a new tab; philosophize as you sign into Facebook.
Everything about the Internet conspires to sweep you away into an arcade world of images and sounds, but you must resist in order to maintain your identity and willpower.
After all, your humanity is based in this resistance—and in the wonderful freedom that follows.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


More than 19 diverse dance groups performed Saturday as part of the annual Arts First Performance Fair. The four-day festival, spanning from April 30 to May 3, featured more than 100 live performances of music, literature, and art.
On Saturday, which Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 called “the biggest day of Arts First” in an email to freshmen, four music groups performed between 1 and 3 p.m. in the Plaza Tent located in front of the Science Center. The music groups were followed by the DanceFest which ran from 3 to 5 p.m. in the Plaza Tent.
The Performance Fair opened with a ballet called “Swan Lake: For the Birds!” based on Tchaikovsky’s work which featured the Hasty Pudding Theatricals as well as administrators and faculty including Dingman, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, and professors Steven Pinker and Diana L. Eck. Various dance troupes, a capella groups, and improv comedy groups followed their performance.
Student performers discussed the excitement of seeing the diversity of groups featured during the fair.
Tiana J. Raphel ’16, a member of the Expressions Dance Company, pointed out the importance of exhibiting the cultural diversity present on campus to the local community.
“It’s just good to bring a wide array of people so that you can share the different cultures,” Raphel said. “A lot of the dance groups are coming from different backgrounds, so people can come and see a large range of backgrounds all in one place.”
Juan J. Aparicio ’15, a member of the Harvard Ballet Company, mentioned the unique atmosphere of the Arts First Festival was due in part to the large and supportive audience.
“It gives it a much more fun dynamic to know that there are kids dancing while you’re dancing too,” Aparicio said.
Aparicio said the festival also provided him with a great opportunity to watch other dance groups perform; his extracurricular commitments usually prevent him from watching other performances, he added.
However, others drew attention to what they called the poor timing of Arts First, which limited student involvement in the festival.
“I think it’s kind of weird that it’s scheduled during reading period,” said Alice L. Newkirk ’17, a performer in the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert and Sullivan Players.
She said that she would have liked to watch other student performances but could not due to her academic commitments.
Asia T. Stewart ’18, another member of the Gilbert and Sullivan Players, said that Arts First was a chance to showcase a different side of Harvard life to the community.
“I think [the festival] shows that Harvard is not just a Mecca of academic achievement,” Stewart said.

The procedure for election to the Faculty Council, the highest elected body in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, could undergo significant structural changes for the first time in the body’s 46-year history if members of the Faculty vote in favor of proposed changes at their monthly meeting Tuesday.
Members of the Faculty Council Election Procedures Committee, citing the “confusing” system currently in place, will propose that the 18-person Council be composed of three cohorts of six representatives each, with an election taking place each year to elect one cohort. Each representative would serve three-year terms, according to a document distributed to the Faculty in advance of their meeting. In each cohort, three seats would be designated for one representative from each of the three FAS academic divisions, and three would be reserved for “at-large” representatives.
If approved, that system would replace a proportional representation system created in the fall of 1969, according to the same document.
Currently, faculty members vote for the Council’s membership by ranking candidates, who must meet a threshold, which is around six votes every year. Once elected, members serve three-year terms.
The current system also requires that Council seats are distributed equally among three areas, the Arts and Humanities, Natural and Applied Sciences, and Social Sciences, each with four tenured and two non-tenured members.
But that system leads to lower voting participation among Faculty, and leads to situations where candidates with fewer first-place votes than others are elected, according to the proposal document.
The current system "is unnecessarily complicated to achieve the objectives of the Council and does not reflect the preferences of those who do vote,” the proposal reads.
Lecturers and preceptors cannot vote in Council elections, and the committee notes that, while that rule was often discussed at meetings, it could not find a “satisfactory resolution” to their representation, saying that it “deserves further discussion by the Council.”
Under the proposal, each department chair can nominate one faculty member to run for the seat in the division with which the department is affiliated, while any faculty member can nominate up to six colleagues to run for an “at-large” seat. Candidates with more than three nominations would be able to stand in the “at-large” election.
Any one department cannot hold more than two Council seats and will not be permitted to participate in an election for either classification of seat in that case.
The candidate with the most votes in a division would win the divisional seat, and the three “at-large” candidates with the most votes would take the “at-large” seats. Ballots would be administered electronically.

Students for Fair Admissions, the nonprofit group suing Harvard for alleged race-based discrimination in its admissions practices, will have 10 to 12 months to gather evidence to support its allegations, although Harvard is disputing which admissions documents will be made available to the group during the discovery period.
Representatives from Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions met at Boston’s Moakley Courthouse on Thursday to discuss the lawsuit, which alleges that the University sets “target percentages” for underrepresented minorities and illegal quotas on students of Asian descent in its undergraduate admissions processes.
William S. Consovoy, a lawyer representing Students for Fair Admissions, requested that Harvard supply personal essays, comments from alumni interviewers, and summary sheets containing comments from admissions officers to the plaintiffs. He argued that these files were vital to understanding Harvard’s “holistic” admissions process.
Consovoy also requested that Harvard not redact student names in the records so that Students for Fair Admissions may analyze whether having an “Asian versus a non-Asian name” affected admissions decisions.
Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who presided over the meeting, said she was disinclined to supply Students for Fair Admissions with all of the files that they requested. She assured the plaintiffs that they would be provided with a “representative sample” of files, but did not specify the exact contents.
The two parties also debated Thursday the duration of the discovery period: Students for Fair Admissions argued for a longer period of 15 months, while Harvard requested an eight-month period. Seth P. Waxman ’73, representing Harvard, said the shorter timeframe would prevent the lawsuit from tying up Admissions Office employees in depositions as the next admissions cycle begins.
Burroughs ruled that discovery would last for 10 to 12 months and capped the number of Harvard employees that the plaintiffs may depose during the discovery period at 10.
The meeting was the latest step in a legal saga that began last November, when the legal defense group Project on Fair Representation launched the lawsuit against Harvard claiming that the University had violated Title VI. The 120-page complaint also detailed the history of the University’s admissions policies, likening Harvard’s cap on Jewish students in the early 20th century to its alleged existing limit on the number of Asian-American students.
Harvard has denied the allegations; the University filed a response categorically denying “each and every allegation, statement, and matter” of the lawsuit in February. And in court on Thursday, Waxman argued that the lawsuit was “created for the avowed and exclusive reason of suing Harvard,” noting that it did not name any individuals as complainants.
Burroughs, for her part, speculated that “the case will ultimately be decided above my pay level” in a higher court.
At the meeting Thursday, parties also addressed the potential intervention of the group Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, which seeks to join Harvard’s opposition to the lawsuit and gathered input on the lawsuit from Harvard students in late April. Both Harvard and Students for Fair Admissions plan to file a response to the intervention in the coming weeks, representatives said Thursday.
Edward Blum, the director of Project on Fair Representation, declined to comment after the meeting Thursday. Blum has previously helped fund high-profile cases challenging affirmative action policies, including 2013’s Fisher v. University of Texas.

Judges named two intiatives, Educational Justice Activists and Prepped, as winners at an educational entrepreneurship conference on Friday for students enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Education course A132: "Educational Innovation and Social Entrepreneurship in Comparative Perspective."
The course, which is taught by GSE professor Fernando M. Reimers, meets at the Harvard Innovation Lab and seeks to promote sustainable educational innovations. Students work on education innovation projects throughout the semester and present the projects to an audience and group of judges at the end of the semester. This year, the award for the best overall project was a pen, wallet, and tote bag.
“Students create a business plan to create an organization to help solve educational challenges,” said Reimers.
Prepped seeks to provide Korean high schools with high quality and engaging education to prepare students for college. The project, currently being piloted in Seoul, gives students critical thinking skills and teaches them English to improve their chances of getting into college. Educational Justice Activists seeks to reduce the income achievement gap by extending the availability of educational resources to poorer children.
“For most of my career, I’ve been doing work on education and getting kids get out of poverty,” said Reimers. “Teaching a course about entrepreneurship is not as interesting or effective as teaching students how to be entrepreneurs.”
In response to the selection of his project as best overall, GSE student Robert M. Lewis, one of the four group members from Prepped, said that “most important to us was the overwhelming support we received from the audience, which will provide our team with extra energy as we forge ahead.”
Prepped team members plan to expand the project to Kenya, the U.S., China, and Mexico, based on the success of the pilot, according to Lewis.
In addition to the 14 judges invited from around the world, audience members were encouraged to provide feedback during the event via clickers. At the conclusion of the presentation, audience members were given Monopoly money and encouraged to ‘invest’ in projects. The projects Agenda 28 and TeachTalk were voted most innovative idea, and Make Me a Freshman and Scholastic Family Bridges were voted best presentation.
Rahim A. Mawji ’15, a student in the course, said that the class consists of three components: “learning from the best actors, collaborating with people who are clearly passionate about education, and lastly actually working on the project,” adding that “the idea is that they put a lot of passionate people together and watch the magic happen.”
Course alumna Peggy W. Mativo ’14 said that “A132 was an amazing experience and so helpful for our work in education in Kenya.”
Her project, called PACE, is a Kenyan program that helps public schools that lack sufficient teachers and gets “young people to volunteer to become teaching assistants so they can go to schools and give back.”

UPDATED: May 4, 2015, at 12:54 p.m.
Emily J. Miller will serve as the College’s first full-time Title IX coordinator, according to an email Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sent to undergraduates on Friday.
Miller previously served as a case manager on the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body, in addition to working part-time as the College’s Title IX coordinator along with Associate Dean of Student Life William Cooper ’94. The appointment comes just a week after the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights released guidance on the Title IX coordinator position, which clarified that Title IX coordinators should be independent as to avoid potential conflicts of interest.
Miller previously recused herself from cases that she had previously addressed in her capacity as part-time Title IX coordinator.
In light of Miller’s appointment, Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde wrote in an email that Cooper “will step back” from his role working part-time as one of the College’s Title IX coordinators. According to Cooper, he will continue to serve in a reduced role.
The move comes amidst heightened scrutiny of the College as it remains under continued investigation by OCR for possible violations of the anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. Federal investigators visited campus two weeks ago. As part of its effort to comply with Title IX, the University has made numerous changes to its policy and procedures surrounding sexual harassment in recent years, including the creation of the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution to investigate cases of sexual assault across the University.
In his email announcing the appointment, Khurana said that Miller in her new position would work with the University’s Title IX Officer, Mia Karvonides, to oversee the College’s Title IX compliance efforts, which may include responding to concerns regarding potential discrimination on the basis of gender or sexuality, and will also serve as “a key point of contact during the life of an ODR complaint.”
According to Khurana’s email, Miller will begin in her new position on May 11.

A report reviewing the status of Harvard College’s Program in General Education states that the program is currently “failing” in many ways to achieve its initial goals, “occupies no place in the College’s identity,” and lacks general and financial commitment from both the College and University.
The report—compiled by a committee of seven professors in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences charged last year with reviewing the program—lists about two dozen grievances about the program, voiced by undergraduates, teaching fellows, administrators, and faculty members in the past year.
Based on interviews and town hall meetings with these constituencies over the past year, the review committee found that students generally do not have a clear sense of the purpose of the program, and that students report not taking their Gen Ed courses as seriously as they do other courses. Students who attended town hall meetings last fall expressed confusion over the program's philosophy and their desires to have more rigorous Gen Ed courses.
“It is disturbing to discover, therefore, that despite strengths, and serious efforts by many constituents, the Program is failing on a variety of fronts,” says the report, which Philosophy professor Sean D. Kelly will present at the FAS Faculty meeting on Tuesday for discussion and was obtained by The Crimson.
FAS Faculty voted to adopt the current Program in General Education in 2007 after a College-wide curricular review over the course of the early 2000s, legislating that the program should aim to achieve four main goals. These include preparing students to act as citizens, to respond to change, to understand ethical consequences of their words and actions, and to teach students to “understand themselves as products of, and participants in, traditions of art, ideas, and values.”
Today, there are 574 courses that count for Gen Ed credit, according to the report. Roughly half of those are “back of the book” courses, or departmental courses that satisfy the program’s requirements. The report states that it is evident that most of these departmental courses were not developed with the principles of Gen Ed in mind.
According to the report, the median size for “front of the book” Gen Ed courses is 50-99, compared to the 10-19 for non-Gen Ed courses.
The report also calls the current program a “chimera,” or a hybrid between a Gen Ed requirement and a distribution requirement, that fails to meet the goals of either type of requirement.
The report defines a General Education program as one that “aims to identify the fundamental value of an education” whose courses are not necessarily housed in certain departments.  Distribution requirements, on the other hand, would necessitate that students take a number of courses from different departments.
“Gen Ed is the head of our requirement because the Program claims to be motivated by a General Education philosophy. But the distribution requirement is the body because many courses that satisfy the requirement fail to manifest or even identify that philosophy,” the report says.
The report also states that Gen Ed course enrollments can be too large; TF’s and teaching assistants find Gen Ed courses to be the most difficult to teach; and section sizes tend to run larger than those in other courses. The Standing Committee on the Program in General Education also cites a lack of financial support for the program, according to the report.
While Kelly wrote in an email that his committee found a number of “terrific” Gen Ed courses, he said “in general the program is nowhere near the best version of what it aims to be.”
The report offers three suggestions to better the program, including clarifying the principles of the current program and changing the program to reflect these principles, instituting a full distribution requirement across departments, or offering a program that mixes elements of Gen Ed and distribution requirements. A mixed program could potentially reduce the number of courses students would be required to take, according to the report.
The committee released the report in February of this year to allow Faculty time for review and comment. Kelly will present this report, along with the committee’s work thus far, to the FAS faculty Tuesday.

­As the weather heated up, so did the Harvard men’s and women’s crew teams as they wrapped up the regular season this weekend, all of them taking home hardware. The men’s heavyweight team’s last race was at home on Saturday against crosstown rival Northeastern, while the women’s teams competed in the Eastern Sprints Championships. RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHT AND LIGHTWEIGHT CREW
The No. 14 heavyweight and No. 3 lightweight teams dominated the Cooper River, with both taking took first place at the Eastern Sprints.
This is the first time in 12 years that the heavyweight team took home the title, and the group did so by sweeping all six grand finals. The varsity eight boat set the tone for the day, securing an open water win over Columbia and Dartmouth.
The Black and White, coxed by senior Jenny Wong and stroked by senior Lizzy Fitzhenry, crossed the finish line with a time of 6:20.75. Columbia and Dartmouth came in about 11 seconds later at 6:31.5 and 6:31.9, respectively. The last boat in the race, Navy, finished over 20 seconds behind Radcliffe, stopping the clock at 6:45.6.
The JV and third varsity teams also had open water wins, with the JV boat by almost 12 seconds over Northeastern, and the 3V boat by 11 seconds over Dartmouth.
The varsity four A and B races were won by closer margins, with the A boat’s race being the closest of the day. Radcliffe won over Columbia by just one second.
The B finished with a time of 7:33.3, eight seconds ahead of Dartmouth, and the C boat won over Boston University by open water.
“The team did awesome,” junior heavyweight Lauren Tracey said. “I know every single boat worked really hard for their win, and sweeping this regatta just proves how deep our team is.”
The lightweights took the Konrad Ulbrich Trophy for the third straight year—the first time in the program history in which the team has won this competition three consecutive times.
The varsity eight, led by junior coxswain Samantha Guhan and senior stroke Adelaide Backer, won over the Terriers by half a boat length. The Radcliffe boat pulled away before hitting the 1,000 meter mark and did not give up its lead. It finished at 6:36.267 with the Terriers at 6:39.183.
The Black and White took second place in all of the other events. Boston University came back for the second varsity race, finishing just under five seconds before the Radcliffe boat, which came in at 6:47.447.
The varsity four boat took second by the same margin as the JV boat, but in this race, behind Wisconsin. The novice four lost by open water to Wisconsin.
MEN’S HEAVYWEIGHT CREW
On the Charles, the No. 5 men’s heavyweight team bested No. 7 Northeastern for the 18th straight year to win the Smith Cup.
“We were coming off a strong team showing in Annapolis,” senior coxswain Jack Smith said. “We had confidence in our team depth from that outing, but we always anticipate Northeastern to be fast, so we took the week’s preparation very seriously and knew it would take exceptional racing from all of us to succeed.”
The first varsity boat took home the Cup with a two-second win over the Huskies. The group finished at 5:40.71, and Northeastern at 5:42.97.
The JV and first freshman teams both fell to Northeastern, coming in a second apart from each other at 5:48.28 and 5:49.49, respectively. Northeastern was over three seconds ahead of the second varsity team, finishing at 5:45.81.
The varsity four A and B teams were behind the first place boat, Boston University’s 4V A boat, by open water, and the 3V and 2F teams came in first and third, respectively, in their race.
“We will continue what we have been excellent at all season—challenging each other in practice to such a degree that no man is allowed to become complacent,” Smith said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A playoff game. A date with an undefeated opponent in Ivy League play. A trip to the final round on the line. This was the situation the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (8-8, 4-3 Ivy) found itself faced with on Friday when it matched up with No. 11 Princeton (14-3, 7-0).
Despite keeping the game knotted up at four after the first half, the Crimson ended up falling by a score of 15-8 at in Princeton, N.J., concluding Harvard's season. On the flip side, Princeton went on to defeat Penn in the Ivy League final two days later.
Both teams came into the semifinal riding a winning streak. The Crimson had picked up two straight home victories, besting UMass Lowell and Yale by a combined score of 27-5. The Tigers were in the midst of a four-game unbeaten streak, last tasting defeat at the hands of No. 1 Maryland on April 8. The teams had previously met in the regular season, a bout at Princeton that was won by the home team, 17-12.
The Crimson found itself in an early 2-0 hole before it rebounded with four unanswered tallies, grabbing a 4-2 edge. Two of those goals came from freshman midfielder Julia Glynn, who came into the contest the reigning Ivy League Co-Offensive Player of the Week.  Glynn was also named to the All-Ivy second team in her debut season.
But the Harvard lead would not live to see the end of the half. Princeton midfielder Olivia Hompe fired a shot past Crimson junior goaltender Kelly Weis for an unassisted score with 1:35 remaining in the first half, tying the game at four.
The Crimson never led in the second half, as Princeton went ahead with a goal just before three minutes after the break. Harvard was able to tie the game on an unassisted tally by junior midfielder Audrey Todd.
Then, the floodgates opened. The Tigers struck for nine straight scores, giving them a commanding 14-5 advantage. Harvard would only get as close as seven the rest of the way in the defeat.
The Crimson's Glynn added an additional second-half goal, giving her a team-high three on the day. For Princeton, Hompe finished with six of the team’s 15 tallies. Tigers midfielder Anya Gersoff added a hat trick of her own, picking up all three scores in the second half.
There were three penalties in the contest, all going against Crimson players in the second half. Sophomore midfielder Megan Hennessey collected two second-half yellow cards, resulting in her being ejected from play with two seconds to go.
Harvard was able to win the turnover battle, only committing six in the game compared to Princeton’s nine. The Crimson’s 19 fouls were also four fewer than the Tiger’s total of 23. Harvard also outshot its opponents in the match by a line of 29 of 25.
In terms of the ever-important goalkeeping battle, however, Princeton came out on top. Tiger sophomore Ellie DeGarmo managed 12 saves, eight of which came in her team’s dominant second half. In comparison, Weis was only able to accumulate three saves in the second period and nine total for the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a decade after battling homelessness on the streets of Charlotte, N.C., and six years after the sudden death of his mother left him parentless, Harvard defensive end Zack Hodges ascended to the highest levels of football this Saturday, negotiating a free-agent contract with the Indianapolis Colts.
Although some analysts had projected Hodges as a seventh-round pick, the senior waited through Draft Day without hearing his name. Then, on Saturday evening, Hodges received a call from the Colts and promptly agreed to terms.
“I think he’ll make it in the NFL,” said Harvard coach Tim Murphy prior to the draft. “I also try to counter that with the understanding of how hard it is to be the best at something you’re doing at such a young age.”
In Indianapolis, Hodges will join Yale senior running back Tyler Varga, whom the Colts also signed as an undrafted rookie.
Elsewhere in the NFL, the Baltimore Ravens nabbed Crimson offensive lineman Nick Easton on Saturday as well. Easton was named to the Associated Press FCS All-America third team for his senior season performance.
But not every professional signee compiled a resume as impressive as Hodges did over his four years. The defensive lineman finished with 27 sacks on his career, the highest total of any Crimson football player.
For his efforts, Hodges was twice named Defensive Player of the Year in the Ivy League. No other Ancient Eight athlete had ever accomplished this feat.
In 2014, he also earned a share of the George “Bulger” Lowe Award, which recognizes the best player in New England.
Even so, Hodges’s 6’2”, 250-pound frame would make him a seriously undersized defensive lineman, and Hodges will likely transition to a linebacker role with the Colts.
“He has the skill set,” Murphy said. “I really believe he’ll make a quality NFL outside linebacker.”
Hodges received national attention over the past few weeks as news sources from the New York Times to Bleacher Report ran features on his journey from homeless teenager to Crimson star to NFL prospect.
The articles relayed the bootstrap narrative of a young man who overcame a trio of tragedies: the deaths of his father, grandfather, and mother.
After brain cancer claimed his father when Hodges was only one, Hodges’ mother Barbara trained her attention on raising her only son.
She brought him to museums and classical concerts; she moved with him from North to South; and, when she lost her job, she slept in a car with Hodges during long homeless nights.
Although Barbara found a job, Hodges’ luck didn’t turn. One morning, in his junior year of high school, Hodges was preparing for school when his mother collapsed. An ambulance sped her to the hospital, but she was pronounced brain-dead within the hour.
Still, Hodges persevered, transferring high schools two more times before entering Harvard as a freshman—and entering the football program that he would shape over the next four years.
“He’s got great resiliency skills,” Murphy said. “The only variable is time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Following a fourth-place outcome at the Ivy League sevens championship, the Harvard women’s rugby team came into the American Collegiate Rugby Association National Championships looking to finish the season on a high note. The tournament also marked the last competition for eight seniors.
“I’ve never been surrounded by so many inspiring, talented, and truly genuine people,” graduating co-captain Kaleigh Henry said. “I attribute my immensely positive college experience mostly to them [and] my family.”
While the Crimson earned a spot in the final-four playoff, Harvard ended the weekend with a pair of losses to finish fourth.
AIC 20, HARVARD 12
When the Crimson offense started moving in the second half, it moved quickly.
Trailing 20-0, Harvard used scores from seniors Henry and Cheta Emba to shrink the deficit to eight. But the score would hold from there, as the Crimson fell, 20-12.
The Yellow Jackets scored off the opening kickoff and went on to take a 15-0 lead over the Crimson at the half. This lead grew, thanks to a score early in the second half.
“I am extremely proud,” senior Brooke Kantor said. “We played at our highest level. I do know that [a lot of the time], our nerves get the better of us.”
ARMY 19, HARVARD 7
Playing for a second time against Army, the Crimson defense struggled early on, allowing the Black Knights to score on three tries.
Coming into the second half of the semifinal match down 19-0, the Harvard defense brought about a stalemate in scoring, with no team recording a try for the first several minutes.
Then an Emba try broke the equilibrium and reenergized the Crimson side.
“The biggest adjustment was probably our mentality,” said Henry. “We came into the tournament focused and ready to fight. Bringing in that tenacious attitude really helped us compete.”
However, Harvard got no closer, as both defenses held to preserve the 19-7 final.
HARVARD 26, NAVY 5
After scoring in the opening minutes, Harvard faced a second-half rally from Navy, which fired back with a try of its own.
Then Emba got the ball in her hands. Over the rest of the match, the senior tacked on two more scores to help her team to a 26-5 win and a spot in the four-team playoff.
Fighting elimination in its first Sunday matchup, the Crimson had jumped to a 14-0 lead before the half before taking the win.
NORWICH 24, HARVARD 7
Heading into its final match of Saturday against the Cadets, the Crimson looked to earn some redemption by picking up its first victory of the day.
Instead, Norwich’s offense overwhelmed Harvard, creating an early lead and holding it until the final whistle. Thanks to a pair of tries from Sophie Mundell and Victoria Olchowoj, the Cadets took control in the opening minutes.
Meanwhile the Crimson offense never got going and tallied a lone score.
AIC 17, HARVARD 7
When Harvard took the field against AIC to start the second half of Saturday’s matchup, the game belonged to either team, with the score knotted at seven-apiece.
Then the Yellow Jackets began to swarm. In the second period of play, AIC earned the victory, holding the Crimson without a try while notching two of its own to claim a 17-7 win.
The Yellow Jackets opened the first half in an emphatic fashion, converting a full-field break to take a 7-0 lead. But Harvard responded in the final minutes of the half, with Muss sprinting for a late try.
ARMY 24, HARVARD 12
Late in a game of momentum shifts, the contest seemed to have swung back into the Crimson’s control.
After building and losing an early lead, Harvard shot out of intermission with a score to close the gap to 19-12. However, the momentum fell back one more time, as Army ran for a successful try to race to a 24-12 victory.
“I’m incredibly proud of the team,” Henry said. “We made huge strides [this] weekend in terms of our individual and team play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For three Harvard track and field athletes—one recent graduate and two current undergraduates—athletic glory does not stop at the Ivy League or even NCAA level. These three competitors, who are no strangers to competing for the Crimson, now have their sights set on gold.
At the 2012 Olympics, Samyr Laine ’06 paved the path, making waves when he not only qualified in the triple jump for Haiti but also finished in 11th place in the competition’s final round. Laine is one of just 20 Harvard track and field athletes to compete in any Olympics since the first modern Games in 1896.
Now, three Harvard athletes are using both international and collegiate competition to prepare for a run at Olympic qualification and an opportunity to become the next Crimson athletes to etch their names in Olympic history.
OFF TO A FAST START
Jade Miller, despite being only a sophomore for the Crimson, brings a laundry list of success in international competition after competing for the U.S. track and field team.
While still in high school, Miller—who is both a sprinter and hurdler—competed at both the Pan-Am Junior Games and U.S. Junior Nationals in the 400 meter hurdles. At U.S. Junior Nationals, the sophomore took second place with a time of 57.21, the ninth fastest time ever for a high school runner. She finished second to then-College freshman Autumne Franklin, who is now Miller’s teammate on the Crimson.
While the sprinter easily demonstrated that she belonged with the elite, she also described competing for her country as a surreal experience.
“It didn’t really hit me until I received a big box of team USA gear in the mail,” Miller said. “Until then, I would just tell people I was going to Colombia [for the Pan-Am Junior Games]. The backpack, warm-up, and uniform they sent made it concrete for me.”
Additionally, the Temecula, Calif., native found, somewhat unexpectedly, an extra sense of pride when competing for the U.S. team.
“It’s one thing to do the Pledge of Allegiance or put your hand over your heart during the national anthem,” Miller said. “But when you put the jersey on that says USA on the chest, it’s a whole different thing. It was something we could all get behind despite coming from different states, different backgrounds, and different schools.”
In 2014, while a freshman at Harvard, Miller competed at the IAAF World Junior Championships with the U.S. Junior National Team, finishing third with a personal best of 56:22 in the 400 hurdles. Earlier that year, Miller finished 12th at the NCAA Championships in Eugene, Ore., in her debut appearance. This season, the sophomore hopes to build on her success and make another run at the NCAA Championships in Eugene.
In Miller’s opinion, the experience she has gained while competing for the U.S. team has helped her become successful at the collegiate level.
“When I went to Worlds, I was freaked out—I was so scared,” Miller said. “But I think the experience has helped me stay grounded. [At Harvard], I tell myself, ‘Jade, this is a big meet, but you’ve competed in bigger meets. Calm down, and just run the lap.’ That helps me relax.”
ACROSS THE POND
For some Crimson athletes, competing internationally does not necessarily mean donning the American Stars and Stripes. While many Harvard athletes who compete at the international level end up representing the United States, there are others who compete for other countries as well.
Among those is Harvard thrower Nikki Okwelogu, who has had a breakout season for the Crimson this year in collegiate competition. Coming into the season, Okwelogu’s best throw in the shot put was 16.09 meters, good enough for a school record.
This year, the sophomore has shattered the Ivy League shot put record several times, most recently at the NCAA Indoor Championships in March, where she recorded a throw of 17.22 meters.
But even prior to her collegiate success, the national track and field team of Nigeria, a country in which Okwelogu holds dual citizenship, had been keeping the Fresno, Calif., native’s talent on its radar.
“My mom sort of just ran into a guy wearing a Nigerian track t-shirt at one of my track meets in high school,” Okwelogu said. “They were originally interested in my older sister, but I caught their attention and made the team later on during my senior year of high school.”
Despite being a member of her country’s team since her senior year of high school, Okwelogu’s first experience competing for Nigeria came this past summer at the Nigerian National Championships, where she won the title in the shot put.
“It was a bit of a culture shock for me,” the sophomore said. “I grew up around Nigerian people—my whole family is Nigerian—but going there and being immersed in the culture was totally different.”
Thanks to Okwelogu’s newfound international career, this past year was the first time that the sophomore had ever constantly trained year-round. Despite being a grueling process, her efforts have paid massive dividends for the Harvard team so far, as evidenced by her performances throughout the season.
While competing for Nigeria at competitions like the Commonwealth Games and the World Junior Championships in the same year has proved a fruitful experience for Okwelogu, the sophomore also described a difficulty in balancing Harvard athletics and international competition.
“It is difficult sometimes now to come back to Harvard and find the same adrenaline,” Okwelogu said. “I’ve been to those meets where your heart is beating out of your chest, and you can’t even breathe. It’s hard to replicate that same environment at Harvard.”
However, Okwelogu’s confidence is at an all-time high when returning to Ivy League contests.
“When I walk in, I say, ‘I own this place,’” Okwelogu said. “I have to act like I own this place, and I have to show everyone that I own this place. It’s a different mentality.”
The Olympics are surely in the back of Okwelogu’s mind as the thrower has said that one of her biggest goals now is to qualify for the summer games in 2016. The sophomore has even gotten a taste of Olympic competition already at the Commonwealth Games, where she ran into a well-known thrower—two-time gold medalist Valerie Adams of New Zealand.
“No one can even remember the last time Valerie Adams lost in competition,” Okwelogu said. “Just standing next to her, she was so tall and intimidating. It was different to walk into a stadium with 40,000 seats filled watching Valerie Adams and realizing that I had to throw too.”
While the challenge ahead of her might be daunting, the sophomore still has two years of collegiate play and an international career ahead of her.
AFTER HARVARD
Maksim Korolev ’14 began his Harvard career as a highly recruited distance runner out of Harrisonville, Mo., where he was a state champion in the 1600 and 3200 meter races and was named Gatorade Missouri Runner of the Year in his senior year.
In his sophomore year of college, following a freshman campaign that saw him place 100th at the NCAA Northeast Regional competition in the 10K, Korolev suffered an injury that prevented him from competing for the entirety of the running season.
Nonetheless, Korolev underwent a meteoric rise during his senior year, thanks in part to regimented trainings sessions with then-teammate James Leakos ’14, who holds Harvard’s second and third fastest times in the 5K and 10K, respectively.
Korolev claimed the NCAA regional title in the 10K and received All-American honors for his third-place finish, an all-time Harvard best, at the NCAA Cross Country Championships in Terra Haute, Ind.
“I trained hard through my junior season,” Korolev said. “In running, if you put in the work, it will eventually show. I had been working a lot in the three years before, and it finally kicked in.”
With one year of eligibility left because of his missed sophomore season, Korolev moved to Stanford University following his graduation from Harvard in 2014.
At Stanford, Korolev has broken onto the international stage by earning the sixth and final spot on the U.S. cross country team to compete at the World Championships. He qualified by running the 12K course in 37:03 in Boulder, Colo., at the 2015 U.S. Championships.
Additionally, Korolev won the inaugural Pan Am Cup, a championship race for athletes from North America, South America, and the Caribbean held in February in Barranquilla, Colombia. At the IAAF World Championships this March, held in Guiyang, China, Korolev finished 57th of 111 runners, and fifth of the six Americans running in the race.
For Korolev, though, the 38-minute race was only a small part of the experience that came with competing on the international stage.
“I’m not going to remember so much the race,” Korolev said. “What I will remember is the week leading up to the race, spending time with the U.S. guys, being in China, and being super sick of the Chinese food.”
If he can continue the success he has had over the past few years, however, Korolev might want to get used to foreign cuisine. While the ex-Crimson athlete is not 100 percent sure of his plans for the near future, Korolev definitely knows that running—and international competitions—are not going to go away anytime soon.
“I think the Olympics would be fun,” Korolev said. “As long as I’m still running, I’d like to make as many U.S. teams as possible. I’d like to stay as competitive as possible on the world stage and continue to improve.”
While there is little doubt that these three athletes have more than proved themselves at the collegiate level, the global stage presents a new series of challenges. But joining Laine on a long list of Harvard track and field athletes to compete in the Olympics is surely within reach.
While the future may still be uncertain, one thing is for sure: these talented individuals have their eyes on gold.

Lily M. Velona is a freshman planning on concentrating in Government with a secondary in Classics. Sofia A. Escudero is a junior studying WGS with a secondary in English. Sofia likes House of Cards and Lily enjoys The West Wing. Neither would be caught dead ordering a pumpkin spice latte. We sent them to Darwin’s (Sofia’s fave study spot) last Monday evening.
Lily: I went to the Mt. Auburn Darwin’s. I was sitting there looking around for people of all genders and ages, like didn’t really know what was going on.
Sofia: It occurred to me that we should clarify which Darwin’s, but I totally forgot to follow up. So I went to the one that I would go to. I realized basically at 6 o’clock, when we were supposed to meet, that we had never decided. So, that’s why I texted [the Flyby Matchmaker].
Lily: Then I got a text from [the Flyby Matchmaker] saying that my date was at the other Darwin’s so I volunteered to walk over… She was sitting at the front… We both expected to see a guy because we saw The Crimson had already done something on two girls going on a date. So we were both pleasantly surprised not to see a guy.
Sofia: She just looked like someone chill…was kind of surprised she was a freshman… but that was fine.
Lily: I personally didn’t care [that she was an upperclassmen]… differences in age are interesting, not prohibitive in forming a relationship.
Sofia: They had these muffin donut things… it was great.
Lily: I was actually really hungry… I got a full on Darwin’s sandwich.
Sofia: We started out with the standard where do you live, what are you studying blah blah blah… And we talked a little bit about activism stuff… She told me about work that she’d done with… Small Claims [Advisory Service]…so that was kind of cool.
Lily: We did the classic Harvard intros. We got to know each other...We actually talked about Green Day for a little bit. I was thoroughly obsessed with Green Day in eighth grade and she’s from the Bay Area so she has a lot of pride and so like meeting someone who had genuine pride for something I was obsessed with…that was meaningful to me as a former Green Day cult member.
Sofia: The only curveball was that… pretty early on [she] was like, ‘Hey I feel like I should say this, but I’m actually in a relationship... so I’m not trying to date.’
Lily: I actually filled out the survey with the person I’m dating…We wanted to see if we’d get each other. But we didn’t get each other… I didn’t tell [the person I’m dating that I’d gotten matched at first] because we decided not to tell each other so it would actually be a blind date. But then I got my match and it was [for] 6 p.m. on [a] Monday and I know they have a meeting every Monday at 6… So I was like ‘Kay I’m going on a date with someone else tomorrow. Don’t worry [it’s the Flyby date].’
Sofia: It was fine… There wasn’t a whole lot of chemistry I don’t think. I don’t think she’d get mad at me for saying that.
Lily: Having this not be a date where I’m looking to impress someone romantically was a catalyst in me getting the sandwich that I wanted to get.
Sofia: I definitely did spill tea on myself several times.
Lily: I really appreciated meeting Sofia. She was really awesome. We had done a lot of similar things but done them in different ways, which was cool. I did more activism through student groups and she’s a part of the Co-op… there’s inherent [activism] in the ideology of the Co-op.
Sofia: She asked a lot about living in the Co-op which is something that takes up a lot of my life in the best way and found out we had some mutual friends.
Lily: We talked about the other [Flyby matchmaker] articles. We were comparing and contrasting our experiences. We thought it was funny how in the first one…that guy who [smelled] really bad sat next to the date.
Sofia: We also were trying to figure out what would make [the Flyby Matchmaker] match us up.
Lily: We have the same general political interests…we both wrote down… ‘all genders’ as opposed to just 'I’m OK with a guy or girl'… probably our gender inclusivity brought us together… which is interesting because neither of us ended up getting someone who was non-binary.
Well, they’ll never know. The Matchmaker’s process is a complex one.
So what does the future hold?
They became Facebook friends (The Matchmaker will know it’s time to call it quits when the couple doesn’t even do that). Lily said, “I would be down to say hi. I don’t think it’s at all inconceivable that I would see her at stuff.” Sofia said, “I’ll probably see her at the Co-op…I’ll say hello…Who knows, maybe we’ll end up in class together.”
It became apparent that they had forgotten to take a selfie, so the picture above is photographic evidence of the fact that they did in fact meet up again. #success?
If you’re single (or apparently even if you’re not and just want to go on a friend-date), not an active Crimson member, and are interested in meeting someone new on campus, fill out this form! We’ll save your responses for next year. You can daydream about your magical date all summer. Talk about anticipation.
XOXO,
The Flyby Matchmaker
