On the eve of Thanksgiving, Harvard men’s basketball had much to be thankful for as twelve players saw action in a 78-60 romp over UNH at Lavietes Pavilion.
Coming off a disappointing loss to Army last Monday, the Crimson looked to right the ship and justify the vote it received in this week’s AP Top 25 poll.
“It was an impressive response to our worst performance at Army,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was really pleased to see how our kids were very focused, very determined against a team that is a lot better than what they displayed tonight.”
The game was never in doubt. Using its size advantage early, the Crimson got on the board with three straight post-ups from sophomore forward Keith Wright and senior co-captain Doug Miller.
“This is the best game I’ve seen [the big men] play all season,” senior guard Jeremy Lin said. “They came out from the tip, running all over the place and being physical.”
Next, Harvard looked to freshman guard Christian Webster, making his first collegiate start in the place of sophomore guard Max Kenyi, who tore his MCL in Monday’s game. The freshman knocked down a trey from the corner for three of his 15 points on the night.
“After that first shot in the corner I felt confident, and I went from there,” Webster said.
The Crimson connected on its first four shots en route to an early 11-2 lead while the Wildcats missed nine straight to start.
The rest of the half was marked by tenacious defense and efficient offense. Harvard held UNH to just 19 percent shooting in the opening period, and did not allow a two-point field goal in the entire frame.
“If we can do that every game, we’ll give ourselves a chance to win,” Lin said.
The offense was equally prolific. The Crimson scored a season-high 46 points in the first half due to 11 three-pointers and 60.9 percent shooting from the field. The catalyst for much of the night was sophomore guard Oliver McNally who tallied a career-high nine assists to go with zero turnovers on the game.
“[McNally’s] halftime stats would’ve been a great line for a game,” Amaker said. “I think the world of the kid...You can count on him—he’s a player that’s going to show up every night.”
With time running out in the opening period, Harvard was in the familiar position of trusting Lin with the ball. The senior cradled the ball for a few seconds, ran off a pick at the top of the key, and buried a three-pointer as time expired to give the Crimson a 46-26 lead. The buzzer beater was the Lin’s third in four games.
Lin finished the game as the leading scorer with 18 points along with seven rebounds and two assists.
For Harvard, much of the second half was devoted to the freshmen. Webster and fellow freshmen Brandyn Curry, Dee Giger, Kyle Casey, Jeff Georgatos, and Peter Edelson all saw playing time and combined for a total of 38 points.
“I like what these kids have been able to do thus far,” Amaker said. “We thought they were going to be able to make strong contributions to our team. Some of them are above and beyond what we thought, at this point, and we’re pleased with that.”
The win was a marked improvement over Monday when the Crimson was plagued by 30 turnovers and 61.3 percent shooting from the free-throw line. Last night, Harvard only coughed the ball up 15 times and hit 22 of 24 from the charity stripe.
“A lot of things were much better. We talked to our kids about regrouping and responding,” Amaker said. “I was very pleased with how we were able to respond in a lot of ways.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Just when it looked like the Harvard and Dartmouth women’s hockey teams might be heading towards overtime last Wednesday night, junior forward Liza Ryabkina marked her return to the ice with a game-winning goal for the Crimson. Harvard (6-3-1, 6-3 ECAC, 3-2 Ivy) beat Dartmouth (4-4-1, 4-4-1 ECAC, 3-2 Ivy), 3-2, at Bright Hockey Center.
“I thought it was a great hockey game, and the fans enjoyed it,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said.  “There was a lot of up and down, a lot of great plays, and a lot of great saves too.”
Senior goalie Christina Kessler had 27 saves in the match, bringing her season save percentage to .940. The mark is just below her career percentage of .941, a stat tied for first among all NCAA goalies.
Even with the impressive numbers, Kessler stuck to the basics.
“You know, a goalie’s job is just to stop the puck,” she.
Kessler and the rest of the Harvard team got the job done on defense and also showed strong play on the opposite side of the ice. Ryabkina recorded one goal and one assist in her first game of the season after coming back from a dislocated knee. Freshmen Josephine Pucci and Jillian Dempsey each contributed a goal and assist of their own, while co-captain Cori Bassett and junior Kate Buesser added assists as well.
Success throughout the lineup has become characteristic of the Crimson squad, with 15 players recording at least one point so far this season, and was clear in yesterday’s matchup.
“Our team played really, really well as a whole,” Ryabkina said.
While Harvard came out with the victory, the game started with back-and-forth play early in the first period.  Neither team seemed to gain an outright advantage, but the Crimson accumulated a 11-2 shot deficit in the frame and didn’t get its first shot on goal until almost 15 minutes in.
“We were off to a slow start,” Stone said. “We didn’t play poorly in the first period, we just couldn’t get to the net and couldn’t get the shots off our stick.”
But with about four minutes left before the break, junior Kate Buesser got the puck behind the Big Green’s net, skated around the front, and crossed it to Dempsey, who was there to put it in for the first goal of the game. But Harvard’s 1-0 lead lasted only a minute, as Dartmouth quickly responded with a goal from sophomore Jenna Hobeika. The period came to a close with the score tied, 1-1.
The Crimson came out strong and regained its lead less than three minutes into the second frame. When Dartmouth was called for an interference penalty, Pucci took only 15 seconds to score and put the Crimson up 2-1.
Once again, the Big Green wouldn’t stay down for long.  After a block and save by Kessler, Dartmouth freshman Sally Komarek scored her first collegiate goal off the rebound to make it a tie game.
Both Harvard and the Big Green had several chances to get ahead before the end of the period, but strong defensive play, key saves by both goalies, and a shot off the crossbar kept the score even going into the final frame.
Each team played aggressively in the third period, but the Crimson showed its talent, racking up an 18-4 shot advantage even against a persistent Dartmouth offense.
“Defensively we came out strong in the third,” Kessler said.
Harvard’s offense also had a number of opportunities to score, but as the clock wound down it was still a 2-2 game. Then Pucci got a hold of the puck with a little over three minutes left in the game and took a slap shot on goal. Big Green goalie Mariel Lacina got the stop, but Ryabkina was there for the rebound and snuck the puck over the line to give Harvard the lead.
“It felt amazing,” the forward said. “I think that was one of the most fun times that I’ve had.”
Ryabkina’s goal turned out to be the game-winner as the Crimson held strong and secured the 3-2 victory over the Ivy League rival.
“In the end it was great to come away with a win,” Kessler said, “especially against Dartmouth.”
