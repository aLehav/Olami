“Something That May Shock and Discredit You” is anything but a straightforward read. It is not so much a memoir in essay form as it is a complex, convoluted portrayal of a gender transition, a complicated relationship with God, and a concurrent loathing for — and love of — words.
Any of these subjects alone would generate more than enough material for a memoir, but Ortberg marries them together with graceful ease. Ortberg thrives, in fact, in a codependent web: narratives around his religion are interwoven with those surrounding his transition, and his writing is illuminated by both.
In fact, most of “Something That May Shock and Discredit You” reads like a line of tidy dominoes stacked up in a row, tumbling down one after the other. Ortberg’s life is shaped by his transition: His great loves, failures, and successes fall within the context of the initial toppled domino of his sex change.
What makes Ortberg’s book compelling, however, is that — despite its lack of order, chronological or otherwise — it does not chase its own tail circuitously. Ortberg begins his book by describing the book that he has not written: “The fight against writing ‘Son of a Preacher Man: Becoming Daniel Mallory Ortberg, My Journey Trekking Through the Transformative Expedition of Emergence, Voyaging Shiftward Into Form — An Odyssey in Two Sexes: Pilgrimage to Ladhood’ must be renewed every day.”
And the result? “Something That May Shock and Discredit You,” whatever genre it might fit into, is not that book. Ortberg views his transition through perspectives that are both wholly unique and heartbreaking. He writes about his love for William Shatner (“Captain James T. Kirk was, and is, at every age and in every incarnation, a beautiful lesbian”) and Duckie from “Pretty in Pink” (“Duckie from ‘Pretty in Pink’ Is Also a Beautiful Lesbian and I Can Prove It with the Intensity of My Feelings”); about drinking (“[s]o many ways to be drunk, so many ways to be a woman”) and about umbrellas (“‘I don’t believe in umbrellas’... ‘What’s not to believe in?’”).
Ortberg’s book is zany and wacky and more than a little messy. There are poems about Lord Byron, dialogue pieces about “Mean Girls,” and long winded rants about the Tudors. Yet nothing is superfluous; everything means something, no matter how loosely related to his transition and personal identity. Ortberg closes his chapter on the Tudors with a painful lamentation for the married simplicity and brutality of oppression: “Put me back in time where gender roles were more strictly enforced, give me a body I’ve got to account for to some greater authority every second of the day,” he writes.
Because, by all rights, a memoir about transition should be messy. Transition itself is messy. Amid all this, God plays a central role in Ortberg’s one-man drama. “God,” Ortberg writes, “has not given us a spirit of anxiety but of power, and love, and of sound mind… you need not be ashamed of me or of being weirdly religious sometimes.”
Likewise, just as Ortberg’s book has no real beginning — it picks up in a place of self-introspection, and continues much in the same vein — it has no real end. His final paragraph deals with baptism, and his own metaphorical baptism into his own skin. “I cannot shake the sense that I have only recently sprung from being held underwater,” Ortberg confesses.
And, just as the book is messy because transition is messy, there is no ending because transition, too, has no end. It is an ongoing process, and pretends, in fact, to be nothing less. It’s right there in the name.
“Something That May Shock and Discredit You” is not a memoir because it is not a portrait of a life. Instead, it is a snapshot of a brief moment in transition, and the moments that came before; the gaffes between the person that was, the person that is, and the person that remains constant regardless of pronouns and haircuts. It is a book about the adequate singing voice that Ortberg loses after his own voice deepens, about the acne that crops up on his neck; about his struggle to parallel park. It is about his wife, his family, and his religion. For all that it is a personal narrative, the book isn’t really about Ortberg. It’s about the act of transition itself.

Netflix is like the ebb and flow of the ocean's tides — it gives and it takes. Every month the streaming platform loses some treasured titles, but gains some new ones, too. Here are movies worth looking out for on the service in March 2020.
"The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) - March 1
This classic stars Tim Robbins as Andy, a man sentenced to life in prison in 1949 for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he insists he did not commit. The film follows Andy’s experiences in Shawshank State Penitentiary and his unlikely friendship with Red, a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in one of his career-best performances. Andy endures abuse from inmates, engages in some criminal financial activities on behalf of a crooked warden, and witnesses the harrowing effect prison can have on the human psyche. “The Shawshank Redemption” is a riveting look at morality, friendship, and the meaning of justice — it’s a classic for a reason.
“Corpse Bride” (2005) - March 1
Tim Burton's “Corpse Bride” is a hidden gem among countless iconic collaborations between Burton and Johnny Depp. The animated film is a Victorian-era musical fantasy, following Victor Van Dort ( Depp), a young man arranged to be married to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). Before the wedding, Victor is dragged to the Land of the Dead by the titular Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), a mysterious but enchanting corpse bride who wants to marry Victor. “Corpse Bride” is as clever as it is macabre, and as innovative as it is endearing with charming stop-motion animation and quirky but lovable characters. Danny Elfman’s soundtrack is the perfect accompaniment to the gothic love story.
"Silver Linings Playbook" (2012) - March 16
“Silver Linings Playbook,” directed by David O. Russell, is the story of Pat Solotano (Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder intent on rekindling his relationship with his estranged wife (Brea Bee) after his release from a mental hospital. Enter Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow who connects with Pat over their shared struggles with mental illness. She’s willing to help him facilitate communication with his wife if he agrees to be her partner for an upcoming dance competition. What ensues is a quirky and realistic portrayal of the unlikely relationship between Pat and Tiffany, with sensitive, nuanced, and at times humorous performances from both Cooper and Lawrence. Lawrence’s Best Actress Oscar was well-deserved for her work in this deeply heartfelt and honest film.
“Space Jam” (1996) - March 1
For nostalgic purposes, stream the 1996 classic “Space Jam.” This live action family movie is the crossover between Looney Tunes and the NBA that the world never knew it needed. When evil aliens want to kidnap Bugs Bunny for an amusement park in space, the Looney Tunes gang challenges them to a basketball game to decide their fate. NBA legend Michael Jordan is the Looney Tunes’ only hope against the aliens’ team, which has the talent of Larry Bird and Charles Barklay on their side. This is a fun and lighthearted watch for millennials looking to reminisce on their childhood and appreciate the rare intersection between film and NBA legends. Make sure to stream this film in preparation for the long awaited sequel, “Space Jam 2” starring LeBron James, set to come out in 2021.

Before Disney became the global film goliath that owns Marvel, the Star Wars franchise, and 20th Century Fox, it ensnared ‘90s and 2000s kids with an iconic slate of Disney Channel Original Movies (DCOMs). Heartwarming, low-budget, and full of teen pop classics, several DCOMs rose above the persistent mediocrity of made-for-TV movies to become true cultural landmarks of our generation.
5. “Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior” (2006)
Likely the least recognizable film on this list, “Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior” features Brenda Song of “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody” smashing stereotypes and saving the world with reincarnated Yin Warrior magic. While many consider the last few years to be a historic period of Asian American representation in Hollywood, Disney created a Chinese-American homecoming queen and superhero who saves the world and develops a romantic arc with a Buddhist monk way back in 2006.
4. “Halloweentown” (1998)
Truly the best childhood Halloween movie, this classic’s role on the list really represents the full series, comprised of four films released between 1998 and 2006. The Cromwell-Piper family at the heart of the series is immensely charming, and the films track them over their formative years as the protagonist goes from 13 years old in the first film to a college student in the last. With magic, family, romance, and early 2000s special effects, these films will never not be nostalgic.
3. “High School Musical” (2006)
No mention of DCOMs is complete without the sensation that shot Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens into stardom and put “Breaking Free” into every karaoke lineup in existence. It is a wildly unrealistic representation of high school, but it gave the world “We’re All in This Together,” so most of its faults can be forgiven.
2. “Camp Rock” (2008)
Demi Lovato and Joe Jonas, two of the greatest Disney child actor success stories, show off their acting chops as much as can be expected from two adolescent singers in this DCOM that portrays the coolest summer camp you never went to. It is a story of hidden identities, superstars, and a typical “Mean Girls” plotline in which characters lose sight of themselves in order to fit in while on the path to developing a voice. “This Is Me” may well be the anthem of a generation.
1. “Lemonade Mouth” (2011)
While this movie has not achieved quite the same mainstream success as the last two, it easily has the best soundtrack, character development, and ensemble of all DCOMs. The teens’ interesting and distinct brokenness comes together to form the uncannily gifted titular underdog rock band. They help each other grow, and even though the film is no shining example of realism, it is infused with an awkward, hopeful, us-against-the-world spirit that feels authentic to adolescence.

It’s the resignation heard round the world. Nearly 15 years after taking office, Bob Iger has stepped down as CEO of Disney. A period of unprecedented expansion for the company, the Iger era saw four multibillion-dollar acquisitions, including Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and, for a cool $71.3 billion, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox fortune. Pile on top of that seven blockbusters to hit $1 billion at the global box office in 2019 alone and it’s no wonder people are calling for a good old trust-busting. Too many roads lead to Disney, and not all of them seem paved with gold.
In the age of nostalgia, the Mouse holds a near-monopoly on the best-known franchises which are fast becoming the only event films audiences will pay to see in cinemas. And yet Disney’s PG-13 mandate and executive-level creative control, according to many, poke holes in the integrity of filmmaking. Blaming Disney for the trend toward vanilla cinema is the people’s current soapbox of choice, and the thrust of the anti-Disney argument sounds an awful lot like Dwight Macdonald’s attack on midcentury mass culture, or Masscult. Macdonald was a cultural critic of the snobbish sort, who claimed that popular art, like movies and comic books, is in fact not art at all, but predigested, profit-seeking commercialism. Disney’s investment in big-budget crowd-pleasers has paid off, and Bob Iger is surely a jack of all trades — but is he the kind of Masscult master that Macdonald so openly despised? And should we be afraid for the future of cinematic creativity?
To those of us who have been spoon-fed Disney since birth, it should come as no surprise that Bob Iger stated in an interview with Oprah that Disney is “in the business of manufacturing happiness and entertaining the world.” How we get from this innocuous statement to the popular contention that Disney is an evil empire is a long story, but we can begin telling it with Iger’s own words. There are two key components of his statement with which Dwight Macdonald would have taken issue: “manufacturing” and “the world.” According to Macdonald, art cannot be manufactured. Art is expressed or, at most, crafted. On the contrary, Disney theme parks and cruise lines are manufactured attractions. They are not the kind of outpouring of spirit which marks true art.
This distinction between art and manufactured culture may strike us as somewhat mystical and most definitely outdated, but it crops up constantly in anti-Disney rhetoric. Consider Martin Scorsese’s Marvel takedown. When asked about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the Academy Award winning director said it was “not cinema,” comparing the superhero films to “theme parks.” The Marvel fandom came for Marty’s well-laureled head, leading him to publish a powerful self-defense in the New York Times. No one puts it better than Scorsese did: “Many films today are perfect products manufactured for immediate consumption … they lack something essential to cinema: the unifying vision of an individual artist.” Who knows what Dwight Macdonald would have thought of Scorsese’s 1970s cinematic milieu, but he surely would have tipped his hat to this well-seasoned defense of the artist’s singular vision.
The importance of the individual artist’s unique subjectivity is not something Disney movies emphasize. How could they? There’s too much money on the line and too many executives eyeing the rough cuts. And when market research dictates what goes in a script, you’d better believe dollars control what falls to the cutting room floor. But the point of this critique is not to say that money is bad for art. It’d be delusional to deny that much art is made in a financial pressure cooker. Rather, it’s Disney’s particular kind of manufacturedness — the workings of a factory designed for brand preservation above all else — that’s worrisome. You can see the stranglehold that the Disney brand has over its own movies: the thematic repetition that has given us franchise fatigue, the uncomfortable transposition of Marvel humor to a Star Wars movie, or the onslaught of live-action remakes that, although poorly reviewed by critics and audiences alike, will keep hitting theaters because they traffic in the ultimate moneymaker: nostalgia. Disney’s films feel so similar to each other not because they are all renditions of the hero’s journey (that’s a pot we’ll never stop dipping into), but because they are all in service of the brand, broadening its reach or cementing its place. Does it have potential as a ride at Disney Shanghai? Greenlight it.
What we’ve seen in the Iger era of Disney is the systematic blurring of the line between advertising and art that Macdonald warned us about half a century ago. “Mass culture is imposed from above,” he wrote. “It is fabricated by technicians hired by business; its audiences are passive consumers, their participation limited to the choice between buying and not buying.” And most people are buying. There’s just not much room at the theater anymore for the capeless crusaders. Bring up the possibility that the Mouse has got the market cornered and, all of a sudden, Disney’s manufacturedness is downright un-American. It’s swallowed entire film studios on its way to stomping out all competition, at least at the box office. The Disney colossus looms large over filmmaking, storytelling, and American identity. Its increased presence abroad is already being viewed as a form of American foreign policy: If Disney agrees to censor an American-made film for a foreign market, is that tantamount to American approval of state censorship?
Setting aside politics, perhaps filmmaking did lose something precious — some personality quirk or Scorsese-esque subjectivity – when Iger stated that Disney is in the business of entertaining “the world.” Or perhaps Disney’s dominion simply proves that it’s a small world after all.

On September 1, 2019 — the day Bostonians call “moving day” — I woke up anxious thinking about the truck, praying everything would go smoothly. Then I picked up my phone and found a message received at around 4 a.m. EST from my uncle in Cairo. It said, “Hey Omar, call me as soon as you wake up.”
I called immediately and he started: “You know your brother Mohamed’s tweet yesterday about fixing the healthcare system in Egypt went viral.” I could tell something wasn’t right — this was more than internet fame. Security forces had come a few hours prior, removed my brother, and taken the phones and laptops of my father and sister. My uncle tried to make it all seem fine. My brother would be back soon, he reassured me, and added that he would call me later after he went to my family’s home. “Rest assured,” he said, but my legs couldn’t carry me, and I found myself sitting on the stairs thinking for a few minutes.
I told myself, my brother used to be an elected official in the Egyptian Dental Association. He’s just completed his graduate studies at Harvard Medical School a few weeks ago, and he has never been arrested before. I thought the government would just question him for a few hours and then release him. Though the many friends and family members that I called all showed sympathy and assured me that he would be fine, something inside me told me otherwise.
Unfortunately, I was right. My brother has now been detained for over 150 days without a trial.
As with many Egyptian youth who were hopeful after the January 25 revolution in 2011, my brother Dr. Mohamed Abdellatif had been working hard to advance his country. A technocrat and dentist, he chose to focus on improving the healthcare system in Egypt and advocating for the rights of healthcare professionals who are increasingly fleeing the country. In fact, half of them have already fled and as many as 83 percent of those remaining have expressed interest in leaving once they get the proper opportunity. This state of affairs is no secret — the Minister of Health in Egypt, Hala Zayed, acknowledged as much in a televised interview in early 2019.
Building on his extensive medical experience combined with his Harvard education, Dr. Abdellatif presented five remedies to stop the brain drain, such as restructuring compensation packages and strengthening security in hospitals to protect healthcare professionals from being beaten by patients’ families. His suggested remedies, which he posted on Twitter, were so resonant that thousands of healthcare professionals reacted positively to them, leading to more widespread media coverage.
My brother expected a positive reaction from the government to his tweet. Instead, his tweet marked the start of the most traumatic experience in his life. For nine days, after he was taken by force from his home, we had no way to know his whereabouts, and later learned that he remained blindfolded and handcuffed for the entire time. Then, he appeared at a prosecution hearing where he was added to a falsified case. He has now been detained for over 150 days without a trial.
What is more shocking is the weak public reaction to his arrest. I once posted about him in a local Facebook group for Harvard alumni in Egypt, pleading for their help, but my post was removed and I was silenced from the group for a week. The only positive reaction I received was that one of the group members reached out to me privately and showed sympathy.
My experience reflects how the news about someone unjustly detained, tortured, or even killed in custody in Egypt has become the norm. These atrocities happen to American and European Union citizens, a former Egyptian president, and public figures — and the world is just silent. Or worse than silence: The U.S. president praises and continues to support the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Thus people in Egypt have become hopeless and the regime has become immune to shaming.
Even Harvard Medical School signed an agreement with the Egyptian Ministry of Health in late 2019, to collaborate and provide training for Egyptian medical professionals, despite the government’s abysmal human rights record — not least against researchers and intellectuals. As more than 200 prominent British academics put it, in a letter opposing scholarly partnerships between the U.K. and Egypt, “We question the wisdom and legitimacy of this move to do business-as-usual with an authoritarian regime that systematically attacks research, education and academic freedom.” Harvard should uphold its integrity and scrap this agreement, as some British universities did in the aftermath of the 2018 letter.
Furthermore, I call upon the entire Harvard community to act to secure my brother’s freedom and that of all Egyptians unjustly detained by their government. Many members of this community have the capacity to help do so. We need to deliver a message to the upcoming generations: “We are behind people who fight for just causes anywhere in the world!”

Next to maybe only Economics 10 and Computer Science 50, Humanities 10 is without a doubt one of Harvard College’s most iconic courses. A survey of classic works in literature, philosophy, and the arts, the intensive expository writing colloquium is known on campus for its substantial book-a-week workload, from “The Odyssey” to “The Federalist Papers”.
Recently, however, the course — often referred to as “Hum 10” — has come under fire for its long-standing heavy emphasis on white, Western authors. In response, Professor Louis Menand IV, the course leader, said Hum 10 simply asks instructors to teach two works about which they are passionate. He cites the structural constraints of Harvard’s lack of diversity in the humanities as the primary cause of the syllabus’s homogeneity.
Really, though? Hum 10 brands itself as “2500 years of essential works.” To make such a claim and then dismiss diversity criticism on the grounds that the course is no more than instructors teaching two books they fancy is disingenuous. One glance at the syllabus is all that is necessary to see that the works selected for this course are meant to represent the humanist canon — “The Iliad”, “Inferno”, “Hamlet”, the Bible. And even if this were merely a coincidence, which it is surely not, the course must accept its role — both in its great power and tremendous responsibilities — as an arbiter of what works might qualify as most “essential.”
For many students, Hum 10 serves as their introduction to the academic humanities. The course has gravitas, and its instructors can’t shy away from that. It’s not just Hum 10. Other survey courses, like Social Studies 10, must critically and actively take up the task of shaping the academic discourse through the young academics they train.
We understand the constraints that Menand mentioned, and we believe that the College needs to do more to diversify its faculty. We have been vocal supporters of an Ethnic Studies department, for example. But, given that Harvard already has a renowned African and African American Studies Department, it strains belief to say that there aren’t passionate and qualified professors to teach literature by black authors.
We also need to differentiate between the issue of racial and gender diversity and the issue of nonwestern exclusion. For example, W.E.B. Du Bois is black, but he still is wholly within the Western canon. Hum 10 and the College need to ensure that they deal with both.
Failing to include significant racial, gender, or regional diversity in a course like Hum 10 sends a message to freshmen, any friends who might see their high pile of course books, and the broader world that looks to Harvard as an arbiter of scholarly merit that these works are not as valuable — that these works do not deserve the status of “great.” The Hum 10 course instructors cannot do it all on their own, but they do not have to wait for the University to bring about meaningful change.

According to Crimson surveys, more than a third of the Harvard College Classes of 2017, 2018, and 2019 entered the consulting or financial services sectors of the workforce post-graduation. Yet, the overwhelming narrative of these professions — “snake” professions as they’re called — remarks on the selfish, gross, capitalistic nature of consulting and finance.
Indeed, despite the fact that finance and insurance, for example, represented 7.4% of the US GDP in 2018, and contributed to both direct and indirect job creation in the United States according to International Trade Administration of the US Department of Commerce, individuals who enter into these industries are often deemed sell-outs who lack passion or a sense of duty to a bigger and greater cause. The irony, though, is that these jobs not only contribute positively to the economic growth of the country and the world, but they also represent accessible routes to financial security for aspirational students. Furthermore, they do often serve as a true passion for students — presenting problems worth solving for individuals and society alike.
At the beginning of every academic year, quite literally on the first day of classes now, consulting firms like McKinsey & Company, Bain & Company, and Boston Consulting Group rent out big ballrooms in the Charles Hotel to introduce themselves to students over soft drinks and firm handshakes. Even though it’s just the first day of the school year, they are already behind major financial services firms like Goldman Sachs who conduct the lion share of their application process almost an entire calendar year before the internship takes place, if not earlier.
Firms within consulting and finance have the luxury of conducting recruitment processes early on and promptly asking for the commitment of students to those internships because of how highly sought after they are. Yet, when students put on their finest Western business attire for these recruiting information sessions, and coffee chats, they either make light of their own genuine interests or are often mocked and ridiculed for their choice of career. No other career opportunities — from public service internships to similarly lucrative tech positions — receive the same kind of backlash and social ridicule that finance and consulting do.
Why are finance and consulting considered exceptionally selfish, worthless professions in the social narrative of the workforce? First and foremost, it seems that the foregone conclusion is that these two industries do not provide anything of value in and of themselves, and rather that they leech off of American capitalism and allow the rich to get richer without contributing to the rest of society.
However, not only do consulting firms provide their services and expertise for private firms, but they also often provide support — even at times, pro bono — to public service partners, as well. And, while they do sometimes charge non-profit organizations for the consulting work that is provided, those prices are at a market rate — one set by the intersection of supply given by consulting firms and the demand for that work from those very non-profit partners. How can one really argue that there is no value provided by consulting services when those very services are clearly valued at a certain rate by both the sellers and buyers of them?
The same logic applies to jobs in the financial services sector. While it may seem like the compensation given to 22-year-old investment bankers, or even more so the bonus they receive should they do a good job, is quite ridiculous and unnecessary — even with the astronomical living costs of New York City’s housing market — that is more a reckoning to be had with society and how it values financial services than the individual students who recruit for and benefit from those jobs themselves.
Many students are driven to these professions for the financial security they provide as an entry-level position. However, even if there are no apparent financial obligations, there is nothing inherently wrong with a student desiring financial security post-college. Even if the business problems clients present to management consultants or the stock options that investment bankers have to evaluate do not inherently interest every student, there is nothing less respectable about students pursuing these sectors if only for the financial security they provide for themselves and their families.
But, even more so, it is more than possible that these very components of consulting and finance do indeed interest students. It is not unfathomable to imagine that someone might actually want to do the research to understand which advertising contract would be most lucrative for a TV network — and the grunt work involved — for example, as done in consulting. In that case, what enables others to look down on a student who is recruiting for a job that is financially stable, legitimately interesting, and provides value to society?
I am not sure I entirely understand why the pursuit of snake professions is so scoffed at — but you can find me at the recruiting events next year trying to find out for myself.

The Harvard Animal Law and Policy Clinic filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on Thursday supporting a Center for Biological Diversity-led challenge to the Trump administration’s wall along the Mexico-United States border.
The Center for Biological Diversity filed a petition for certiorari on Jan. 31, asking the Supreme Court to review six decisions by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security which allowed the Trump administration to waive over 40 federal laws that would slow down the construction of a border wall.
The Law School clinic represents the North American Butterfly Association and the National Butterfly Center — who manage a refuge along the border — as amici curiae in the case. Their brief claims the waivers DHS approved subvert laws that protect endangered species such as butterflies and moths.
“This includes irreparably harming dozens of rare animal and plant species that inhabit the Lower Rio Grande Valley, and forever destroying the already extremely fragile ecosystems on which they depend,” the brief reads.
Law Student Ashley Maiolatesi said the proposed border wall will differ from the barriers previously in place and could harm animals living in the area.
“It's going to be made of steel and metal and be completely solid, and it's going to have stadium lighting around the top and so that affects a lot of animals in their migration patterns and how they breed and travel and all sorts of things like that,” Maiolatesi said in an interview.
“Anything that is like a terrestrial animal — like the endangered ocelot that lives in that area — it can't obviously get past this 36-foot high wall,” she added. “That is a huge issue because these animals are already so endangered.”
Maiolatesi also said constructing the wall would necessitate clearing land on either side of the border. The amicus brief describes the proposal for this 150-feet-wide clear-cut area as an “enforcement 10 zone” and claims it would destroy an estimated 20 miles of habitat for each mile of the wall built.
“That eliminates over 13,000 acres of viable habitat along the Rio Grande Valley right now,” she said.
The brief mentions additional concerns about the proposed wall, including the lack of a sloped escape route for animals in the case of fire or flood and an increase in danger, pollution, and erosion due to high-speed patrol vehicles.
Maiolatesi said the Law School clinic hopes to raise awareness about the alleged lack of research into the potential consequences of the proposed wall.
“None of the environmental assessments or any paperwork was filed on what these ramifications would be if these changes to the law were made,” she said. “We wanted to really bring to light the animal aspects, and how this was going to be affecting animals in the area throughout the United States and Mexico.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council held its weekly general meeting Sunday over the video conferencing platform Zoom due to coronavirus concerns.
Council meetings usually take place Sunday at 4 p.m. in the Isaacson Room in Smith Campus Center. But this Sunday, representatives joined the general meeting virtually from the comfort of their dorms, house dining halls, and, in the case of UC president James A. Mathew ’21, even a Panera Bread.
“On account of recent developments regarding COVID-19 in the Boston area, this week's UC General Meeting will be conducted via the telecommunications platform Zoom,” UC secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23 wrote in an email to Council representatives Saturday night.
At Sunday’s online meeting, representatives discussed the week’s Grants Pack, which allocates funding for student organizations. They also discussed a proposal to integrate College X Change, an online shopping platform for students, with my.harvard, an online portal that houses students’ academic and personal information as well as Harvard’s course registration system.
UC Finance Committee chair Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 and UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22 sponsored the legislation about the Grants Pack, which the Council unanimously adopted. In the Grants Pack, the Council allocated $16,000.15 to various student organizations.
While the Council discussed the Grants Pack legislation, Lowell House representative Rachel L. Reynolds ’22 raised questions about funding in light of student organizations’ event cancellations due to coronavirus. Ganesh said some student organizations have already cancelled their grant requests due to coronavirus.
“If they’re no longer holding the event, I just zero out their application,” Ganesh said.
UC Social and Residential Life Committee Vice Chair David Y. Zhang ’23, UC Parliamentarian and Historian Soyoun “Soy” Choi ’23, and Harris sponsored the legislation on the College X Change program, which the Council also unanimously adopted.
The Council will work with Harvard University Information Technology to integrate College X Change with my.harvard so students can easily access the site. As an online shopping platform, students can use College X Change to find more affordable goods. The site, which is already sponsored by the UC, includes course materials, test preparation books, event tickets, dorm supplies, technology, and clothing among its offerings.
The Council will not have its weekly meeting next Sunday due to spring break.

Scientists at Harvard’s Wyss Institute have identified chemicals that could effectively pause biological aging as part of their “Biostasis” project, now over a year after they signed a five-year contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in December 2018.
The team’s goal is to achieve a form of biostasis — that is, “pausing” biological aging — within a living organism by reducing its cellular metabolism. Cellular metabolism is the set of chemical processes that occur within organisms to keep them alive. Reducing it would essentially stop biological time and keep organs in an unchanging state.
Richard Novak, a senior engineer at the Wyss Institute and member of the Biostasis group, said pursuing cryptobiosis, a form of biostasis in which cellular metabolism completely stops, would be nearly impossible. Instead, the team is trying to induce a hibernation-like state, or “torpor,” in which metabolism would be significantly reduced.
“A less extreme but still very, very effective [case] is more like the state of torpor, like people studied in Arctic ground squirrels a lot,” Novak said. “And that’s more like seasonal torpor, where for several months they go into this torpor state. There’s also daily torpor, where a lot of animals — for example in the tropics or the deserts — they go into torpor to conserve energy when there’s no way that they would find food or water.”
Novak said the ultimate goal of the project is to achieve a similar state that would reduce metabolism by “tenfold or higher,” while also being “safe and recoverable.”
Donald E. Ingber, the founding director at the Wyss Institute and principal investigator for the project, said the team has discovered chemical compounds that achieve biostasis in tadpoles.
“We have some chemicals already that, at least in some model systems, like where we use swimming frog tadpoles, we can add and their metabolism slows and their breathing slows and they stop moving,” Ingber said. “And when we wash them out they rebound back to normal.”
Ingber said these chemicals could eventually have medical applications as an injection for humans.
“From the military perspective it’s probably going to be somebody who’s injured badly, so it’s probably not going to be oral,” Ingber said. “So, it’s probably going to be injectable. And it could be inhaled, but if someone’s really badly injured, it’s probably going to be injectable.”
Novak said the team is now focusing on achieving biostasis in specific parts of the human body, which he said could allow doctors to delay surgical procedures for certain patients. He pointed to cases in which transplant patients might have to recover from other injuries before undergoing surgery.
“Let’s say the patient also has burns, they won’t actually be able to have the surgery to reattach the limb, and they lose the limb,” Novak said. “And so if you can just put the limb on hold for, let’s say, several weeks while the patient heals, then you can reattach it.”
Ingber said the team has made much greater progress than he initially expected and praised the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s funding of projects like Biostasis.
“We’ve already made major headway in the first nine months to a year,” Ingber said. “I don’t think we’re going to get it to human-level or whole animal-level in the near term, but I think we’re going to come up with compounds that could have commercial value for particular applications and will make major headway along the path to the bigger goal.”

As the debut of the new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston fast approaches, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III discussed new resources for students and faculty at the campus in an interview Sunday.
The new Science and Engineering complex is expecting to receive its certificate of occupancy in May and then the initial transition of office spaces will begin in the first week of June, according to Doyle. He added that not all faculty will move to the campus at the same time, and that another “wave” of faculty will remain in Cambridge initially and transition to the new complex in January 2021.
“Some of the faculty will move in a second wave that will happen in January. And that was mainly because they've joined us recently, we didn't have their labs optimized, or designed, or finished,” Doyle said.
Doyle said he and other administrators hope to make the Science and Engineering Complex a facility for all Harvard affiliates, adding it will host not only SEAS classes but also courses in other parts of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“This is a Harvard building. This is not just an engineering facility or resource. So we're trying to make it as attractive as possible to pull the community in and have events there, to have teaching there, to have collaborations there,” Doyle said. “It really is a key part of what we want to achieve and what Harvard wants to achieve with this resource.”
Doyle also said he anticipates that the new complex will collaborate extensively with surrounding facilities, including the ArtLab, iLab, and Life Lab.
The American Repertory Theater — currently located in the Loeb Drama Center on Brattle Street — has already begun planning collaborations with the SEC in anticipation of its move to Allston in the near future, Doyle said.
“We're brainstorming with [Artistic Director] Diane Paulus,” he said. “They’re going to have some amazing facilities and fabrication equipment in their complex or their performances we might collaborate on that either have a scientific theme or a societal theme that we want to be involved with.”
Doyle said that the new complex gave faculty the opportunity to redesign classrooms that allow them to innovate new styles of teaching, comparing the developments to Harvard Physics professor Eric Mazur’s invention of the flipped classroom in the 1990s. He said the complex will include unique features not found at other universities, citing the “plaza clubhouse” — a classroom with a large central room attached to several smaller “breakout” rooms — as an example.
“The teams can split out, go into these side rooms, and then rejoin and come back into the main room and be part of like a full lecture kind of experience,” Doyle said. “I'm not aware of facilities like that anywhere. A bunch of our faculty brainstormed, and they came up with this idea to do something pedagogically different since we had a real clean slate and we were designing the teaching space from scratch.”
Stefan Behnisch, the German architect at the helm of the project, has been collaborating with SEAS to prioritize innovative and sustainable design, according to Doyle. Some design features include a groundwater-catching cistern in the basement, green space behind the building, and angled window shades that adjust seasonally while letting in sunlight.
“The campus pressure has been that we want a sustainable building,” Doyle said. “In many cases, you might get a tug of war there. In this case, it hasn't been, because what the campus wants is what the architect has a vision for and excels in themselves.”

At the Harvard College Women’s Center’s 14th annual Women’s Week, eight student-led events celebrated the turn of the decade with the theme “New Visions,” in honor of International Women’s Day.
The Women’s Center has historically hosted Women’s Week to facilitate conversations surrounding intersectionality and women’s and gender issues. The theme “New Visions” addresses the changing ways in which society discusses gender issues — while also looking forward to how women’s roles will manifest in the future, according to a post on the Women’s Center’s Facebook.
Student organizations spearheaded a variety of events throughout the week, ranging from panels to social dance lessons to self-care. Madison L. Fabber ’22 — who moderated a Women’s Week panel and helped organize the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team’s event — said she think Women’s Week is "really important.”
“It gets us this space and this dialogue for so many people to come together and explore gender and identity through all these interesting facets,” Fabber said.
The Albanian Leadership Initiative Series held a conversation Tuesday titled “From Montenegro to the Red Carpet: A Life of Giving” with model and philanthropist Emina Cunmulaj, who spoke about social activism and women’s empowerment. Later that evening in Emerson Hall, Latinas Unidas assembled a group of panelists — including Amira Al-Subaey, an organizer for the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition — and Harvard students to discuss women of color in politics.
At a panel and social dance lesson Friday called “Samba Rolls and Gender Roles,” officers and coaches from the Ballroom Dance Team discussed how they have been affected by gender norms in the ballroom and how those standards are changing. The Women’s Center wrapped up Women’s Week on Saturday with an event about “How Women Are Changing the Game,” to celebrate the achievements of pioneering women who have been overlooked in history.
Harvard Ballroom Dance Team Captain Olga Kiyan ’22 said she thinks that women are often “made to feel like they’re not enough” and consequently “start to doubt their abilities.”
“Starting those conversations and being like, ‘You’re not alone. You are enough, and what you’re doing is amazing,’ and having those types of discussions, I think, is important to help combat that,” Kiyan said.
Stephanie Javier, an Extension School student who attended the ballroom event, said Women’s Week helped her reflect on women’s identities.
“I think that it’s really wonderful that we as women are awakening to our natural feminine energy and recognizing and acknowledging how powerful it is: this very nurturing force, you know, this very nurturing energy,” Javier said. “And to be a part of that is quite an honor.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past several months, the organization Harvard Forward has engaged in an ambitious bid to reshape the Board of Overseers around the issue of climate change. Recently, an unusual group has come to their aid: older alumni.
Harvard Forward recently campaigned for five candidates to sit on the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body. Their campaign calls on the University to divest from fossil fuel companies and argues that the school should reserve 20 percent of seats on the Board of Overseers for recent graduates, as well as develop more transparent investment guidelines.
Each Harvard Forward candidate received over 4,500 alumni signatures, according to a Harvard Forward press release at the time. About 3,000 signatures from eligible voters were required to put a candidate on the ballot.
Alumni supporting Harvard Forward filled out nomination forms in person during the campaign’s office hours in more than 50 cities around the world, including Berlin, Los Angeles, and Tel Aviv. Nominations were also submitted directly to the University online through Harvard’s election website.
After seeing a tweet about the campaign in November, Robert “Bob” Treitman, who is in his 60s, said he attended a meeting with some of the campaign’s leaders and began his own organizing.
“It was quite energizing to me to see the next generation stepping up and taking care of some things, some issues that need to be taken care of and addressed,” Treitman said.
After a conversation with his father about reaching alumni in continuing care facilities, Treitman said he realized he could connect with Harvard alumni in these facilities and ask for their help in collecting signatures.
Treitman eventually collected signatures from 75 class years from the year 1944 to 2019. He called the issue of climate change “absolutely” multigenerational.
“I think this issue of climate change resonates with those my generation and older,” he said.
Jane Martin ’51 — a resident in a continuing care facility in Lexington, Mass. — said she received an email from Treitman about getting involved in the Harvard Forward campaign while she was working on a book about environmental harm.
“I felt that I was going to be hypocritical if I didn’t say ‘I believe 1000 percent and of course I was going to collect signatures,” she said. “Next thing I knew, I was in charge of doing that for Brookhaven.”
Martin said she collected 62 signatures over a period of three days. Over her facility’s email list, dubbed the “Rebb,” Martin asked residents to sign the petition forms. As the number of signatures grew, she sent out notices.
“I started calling it ‘The Signing,’” she said. “Any time people signed I would put another notice on the Rebb.”
She also used the Rebb to announce that she and a friend would be sitting in a common space from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. on a Monday and Tuesday morning to talk with residents as they went to grab a coffee.
“We just sort of grabbed the people and had them sit down and fill out these forms,” she said. “Practically, everyone wanted to do it.”
She said it was “outrageous” to think that older generations don’t care about climate change.
“Of course us old folks believe that this has to be done,” she said. “I mean that’s just outrageous to think that we don’t care.”
Across the country, Anne B. Sobol ’66 collected signatures over coffee and dinner in Sonoma County, Calif.
After being contacted by one of her former roommates at Radcliffe who wanted her to sign the petition, Sobol — a former Crimson editor — said she reached out to Harvard Forward and started contacting nearby alumni. She said she attained 35 signatures by the end of the campaign.
“I set up two times when I would be in coffee shops locally,” Sobol said. “I also offered people the alternative of coming to my house.”
Sobol noted that she thought the online process was “cumbersome,” which she said required a Harvard key login, printing documents, and then rescanning them.
University spokesperson Hennessey wrote that online voting was created in 2016 to increase voter participation.
“Online voting was introduced to provide greater and easier access for more alumni around the world to participate in the process,” Hennessey said.
Sobol said she became involved with the campaign after living for years in Louisiana and in California, where she witnessed numerous hurricanes, floods, and wildfires.
“Climate change is very real to me, and I feel like people need to take it more seriously,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Associate Applied Physics professor Shmuel M. Rubinstein sued Harvard in Middlesex County Superior Court last week, citing a dispute concerning his employment contract.
Rubinstein, who served as principal investigator in a lab conducting research on the physics of complex systems, was denied tenure at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in May 2019. He filed suit on March 3 against the President and Fellows of Harvard College, a formal name for the Harvard Corporation. He also sued SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III and Computer Science professor Krzysztof Z. Gajos.
In the complaint associated with his lawsuit, Rubinstein alleges that the decision to deny him tenure was made “unlawfully,” and was “based on false information” about student complaints about him “improperly considered in the tenure process,” rather than his academic merits.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff wrote in an emailed statement that Rubinstein’s complaint is under review by the University.
“Harvard is reviewing Prof. Rubinstein’s complaint, but his central claim — that the University’s decision to deny his request for tenure was based on grounds other than merit — is false,” Karoff wrote.
Karoff added that Harvard bases tenure decisions on several factors, including research and potential to make meaningful academic contributions in the future.
“The Faculty of Arts and Sciences tenure process is based solely on the quality of a faculty member's research, teaching, and academic citizenship,” Karoff wrote. “FAS reserves its limited career-long commitments to scholars who are likely to make significant and lasting contributions to their academic disciplines. The process is clear, well defined, and available in writing to every faculty member.”
Rubinstein began his career at Harvard in 2009 as a postdoctoral fellow. According to his complaint, by the end of that fellowship, he was offered tenure-track positions at Harvard and at another institution, the Weizmann Institute of Science — a public research university in Israel — and chose to take the latter job offer.
In 2013, Rubinstein returned to Harvard as a tenure-track assistant professor in SEAS’s Physics department. In 2016, he successfully applied to be promoted from assistant professor to associate professor, according to the complaint.
The complaint states that in March 2018, just months after that promotion, Rubinstein spoke with Doyle about his “prospects for tenure,” and in May of that year, Doyle approved an early tenure review for Rubinstein.
In March 2019, the departmental committee tasked with completing the first phase voted “unanimously” in favor of promoting him to a full tenured professorship, according to the complaint.
After initially making it through the departmental review with a “unanimous” vote in favor of full professorship, his progress toward tenure came to a stop, Rubinstein alleges in his complaint.
The complaint states that Rubinstein did not ultimately receive tenure because the Committee on Appointments and Promotions — the FAS body that typically conducts the next step in the tenure process — reviewed three letters from two graduate students and a postdoc in Rubinstein’s lab, which Rubinstein charges was outside its bounds.
“Harvard allowed its Committee on Appointments and Promotions (“CAP") to consider letters from three former members of his lab that falsely denigrated Professor Rubinstein's mentorship of them,” the complaint reads. “The CAP considered and heavily weighted these letters even though it should have never had access to them, and even though there were many more positive letters that the CAP never saw.”
The complaint alleges that three members of Rubinstein’s lab — dubbed “Graduate Student #1,” “Graduate Student #2,” and “Post-Doc #1” — brought complaints against Rubinstein, some of which Doyle had previously dismissed as “without merit” or not warranting “further investigation.”
According to the lawsuit, Graduate Student #1 filed a complaint with Doyle claiming that Rubinstein fostered an “abusive environment” after spending approximately five years in Rubinstein’s lab. After Doyle conducted an investigation in 2018 and cleared Rubinstein of wrongdoing, Graduate Student #1 responded by filing a second complaint with FAS’s Committee on Professional Conduct. That complaint was dismissed, Rubinstein’s lawsuit claims.
Post-Doc #1 came forward with concerns over a professional disagreement after a dispute regarding the authorship of a paper, according to the complaint. Rubinstein alleges in the complaint that he told the student “in strong terms” that he felt they had “disrespected colleagues and collaborators at SEAS” and committed a “serious and troubling” professional error.
In 2017, Graduate Student #2 took up a position unrelated to Rubinstein’s lab and received negative feedback on their performance from a supervisor, Rubinstein’s complaint alleges. Graduate Student #2 believed Rubinstein was “spreading rumors” about them related to that negative feedback, according to the complaint.
Rubinstein claims in his lawsuit that, in May 2019, he met with Doyle, who told him that CAP had denied him tenure based on “a few negative student letters.”
Rubinstein also alleges that, after Harvard denied him tenure, Gajos “undermined” his attempt to get tenure at the Weizmann Institute of Science by spreading “false information about Professor Rubinstein’s mentoring relationship with these three students.”
In fall 2018, Rubinstein contends, the Weizmann Institute approached him about returning to the institute. The two parties “discussed a tenured position,” and by spring 2019 “were close to finalizing an agreement,” but he contends that, after Gajos spoke to the Weizmann institute’s hiring committee, the agreement fell through.
“After Harvard denied Professor Rubinstein tenure, Professor Gajos, acting within the scope of his employment at Harvard, intentionally interfered with Professor Rubinstein's ability to gain future employment by falsely informing another institution, which was in the process of making Professor Rubinstein a tenured offer. Professor Gajos falsely stated that Professor Rubinstein had been found responsible for a pattern of harassment and abuse against three former mentees.”
Gajos declined to comment Monday on the material contained in Rubinstein’s lawsuit.
He said in a December interview with The Crimson that he was contacted by a professor at the Weizmann Institute who was “deeply concerned” about allegations of harassment against Rubinstein and who asked whether any SEAS faculty would be willing to “share information.” He said that he was “familiar” with the disagreements and that he agreed to speak with the hiring committee.
Ofer Aharony, the head of the Senior Appointments and Promotions committee of the Weizmann Institute’s Faculty of Physics, declined to comment on Rubinstein’s tenure case, writing in an email that appointment proceedings at the institute are confidential.
Applied Physics department chair Eric Mazur declined to comment on the suit. He wrote in an email that his department has been expressing “growing discontent” over the University’s tenure decision.
“As Chair, I'm dealing with a growing discontent over Harvard's denial of tenure to Professor Rubinstein by a large number of faculty in my area (and beyond), who all consider Professor Rubinstein an exceptional scholar and a great colleague,” Mazur wrote.
In early November 2019, 31 senior faculty members signed a letter to Harvard administrators stating they disagree with the decision to deny Rubinstein tenure.
Rubinstein did not respond to requests for comment on his lawsuit. He is represented by Boston-based attorney Monica R. Shah, who could not be reached for  comment.

In January, the World Health Organization deemed a novel coronavirus outbreak centered in Wuhan, China, a public health emergency. Authorities have identified roughly 109,900 cases and 3,800 fatalities worldwide.
As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Massachusetts rises, Harvard administrators have detailed a series of plans to prevent its arrival and contain a potential outbreak on campus. In response to the virus, they have discouraged all non-essential travel and prohibited University-related travel to countries with a Level 3 Warning from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Associate Professor of Epidemiology at the School of Public Health William P. Hanage said that, while he and many of his colleagues consider the coronavirus outbreak a difficult-to-contain “pandemic,” University affiliates should not panic.
“I've been trying to instill the mantra, ‘don't panic, do prepare’, because panic is just stupid. It doesn't help at all. Nor does fatalism,” he said. “But we ought to prepare for getting ahead of it and stopping it.”
Registrar of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael P. Burke — who is also the co-director of the Harvard College Emergency Management team — said he will provide biweekly emailed updates on coronavirus and any other necessary information to Harvard affiliates.
As the outbreak continues, The Crimson will update this article with a brief summary of its impact on campus.
Several universities across the nation saw increasing restrictions for on-campus gatherings over growing concerns related to the novel coronavirus on Monday.
Princeton University President Christopher L. Eisgruber wrote in an announcement to university affiliates that Princeton will conduct classes via virtual instruction starting March 23.
“We understand that these and other measures will cause significant disruption and inconvenience to the campus community, but we strongly believe that actions taken now will have the greatest chance of decreasing risk, and that the potential consequences of not acting could far outweigh these short-term disruptions,” Eisgruber wrote. He also encouraged students to consider staying home and not returning to the university after spring break.
MIT administrators announced on Monday that classes of more than 150 students would transition to virtual instruction beginning on Tuesday, March 10.
Berklee College of Music administrators wrote in a Monday email to college affiliates that any individuals traveling to or returning from countries designated as Level 2 or 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or states where emergencies have been declared — including California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Utah, and Washington — will have to complete 14-day self-quarantine prior to returning to the college. However, they wrote that all events and performances were being held as scheduled.
On campus, Harvard College administrators also announced several postponements and increased regulations on campus in a biweekly email update to College affiliates. College Emergency Management Co-Director Michael P. Burke said annual Housing Day festivities — originally scheduled for Thursday — will be postponed in accordance with University guidelines to avoid gatherings of 100 people or more.
Burke also said that at this time, Harvard University Health Services would not provide testing for COVID-19, with all diagnostic testing to be conducted only through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the CDC.
Senior Associate Director of Athletics Nathan T. Fry wrote in an email that Athletics is prohibiting all varsity teams from air travel.
“Following the University’s most recent guidance and guidelines on travel, all air travel for Harvard Athletic contests, including regular-season, spring break and NCAA air travel is prohibited until at least April 30. The overall health and well-being of students, staff and fans are our highest priority at this time,” Fry wrote.
On Monday, the Shorenstein Center at the Kennedy School announced via email the cancellation of the annual celebration of the Goldsmith Awards set to have taken place this week.
The Harvard Art Museums also announced in an email the cancellation of four events occurring during March and early April in accordance with University guidelines.
Several student events on campus were cancelled, including the annual fashion show Eleganza and the annual Spring Into Wellness event hosted by the health peer-education groups on campus.
Increased precautions also affected a growing number of large classes.
Students of Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics,” which takes place in Sanders Theater, received an email Monday from the course’s teaching staff that a midterm exam scheduled for Wednesday would be administered electronically instead of in-person.
Late Monday night, Government professor Stephen Chaudoin wrote to students in Government 40: “International Conflict and Cooperation” that course staff would aim to book several small rooms, rather than a large lecture hall, for the class’s midterm exam Tuesday.

As of Sunday evening, health officials reported 545 cases of the coronavirus and 22 deaths in the U.S. In Boston, nine cases have been reported, five of which attended a recent meeting hosted by the Kendall Square-based company Biogen, where three employees later tested positive for the virus. As the risk to Boston residents rose over the weekend, a slew of cancellations and postponed events followed on campus.
In a Friday email, Harvard administrators said they “strongly discourage” non-essential meetings or events with 100 or more people and prohibited all University-related international travel and non-essential domestic air-travel.
Three musical groups cancelled a biannual a capella concert slated to take place on Friday in Sanders Theater two hours before the show began, instead livestreaming the event. Sanders Theater announced that it would no longer allow outside renters through April 30.
Memorial Church announced Friday that its weekly Sunday Worship would not take place in person but would instead be available as a broadcast service over WHRB, Harvard’s radio station. The church also cancelled its School, Faith and Life Forum and the William Belden Noble Lectures scheduled to take place over the next week.
According to the producers of the Hasty Pudding show HPT 172: “Mean Ghouls,” Natalie Needle and Samantha Meade, all further New York and Bermuda productions of the show were cancelled.
Women Engineers Code, the largest student-run conference in the country for women engineers, was also cancelled due to the University’s upped guidance.
On Sunday, Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 announced that all JFK Jr. Forums would be postponed until April 30, but that after spring break, the IOP would explore other ways to present speakers virtually. IOP study groups and student planning will continue with larger spaces to allow for “social distancing,” IOP fellows’ guests to join remotely, and further support if programs do need to move online.
Increased precautions also affected a number of classes over the weekend.
Students of Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics,” which takes place in Sanders Theater, received an email Sunday from the course’s teaching staff that Monday’s lecture would still take place but asked attendees to practice “social distancing.”
“We urge those who come to Sanders Theatre to practice ‘social distancing,’ by leaving space between you and the next student (ideally two seats of empty space). We will open the balconies to increase the ease with which you can spread out in the lecture hall,” they said.
Stat 111: “Introduction to Statistical Inference” professor Joseph K. Blitzstein wrote in an email late Sunday night that the class would shift a Tuesday midterm exam from an in-person test to a timed quiz on the course site.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said her office’s fall 2020 review of tenure procedures will examine neither Harvard’s use of ad hoc committees nor individual tenure denials.
Gay wrote to faculty in December that she would initiate the tenure review days after more than 100 faculty called for such a review.
She said on Thursday that she is currently speaking with faculty to understand their questions about the tenure promotion process and define the scope of the review. Gay also issued an open invitation for faculty to speak with her during February’s faculty meeting and said she is planning to meet with both department chairs and the FAS Committee on Appointments and Promotions.
Gay said that, because she continues to gather information from faculty, she cannot define precisely what questions the review will answer.
“We’re very much in listening mode and are still quite a ways away from settling on the substance,” Gay said.
Still, Gay did comment on several topics the review will either address or set aside.
As part of the review, Gay said she hopes to “benchmark” peer institutions’ tenure processes — comparing aspects such as the length of the process and the various reviews that are conducted during the process — to see what FAS can learn from them.
She added that the review will not examine the use of ad hoc committees in the tenure process because they are decided at the level of the University, rather than by FAS.
Gay also said she will not examine individual tenure cases, including the University’s decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña, as a part of the review. Hundreds of students and ethnic studies scholars within and outside Harvard have condemned the University for its decision to deny García Peña tenure.
Asked if she would examine how candidates’ race and gender impact tenure outcomes, Gay said such factors are not bases for evaluation in the tenure process.
Aside from examining tenure, Gay is currently engaged in a number of other administrative proceedings.
FAS is currently reviewing the culture and structure of Harvard’s Athletics Department. Gay said she hopes FAS will be able to share a report on the athletics study with Harvard affiliates this spring.
The outside consulting firm conducting the athletics study, Mercer, has finished collecting data regarding student athletes’ experiences and the department’s structure and will continue to collect data regarding the department’s organizational structure, according to Gay.
Gay’s administration is also currently conducting three major searches: a search for faculty specializing in ethnic studies, a search for the next Athletics Director, and a search for the next dean of the Division of Continuing Education.
At least ten ethnic studies faculty candidates will visit Harvard to give talks and meet with faculty and students in the coming weeks, according to Gay. After all ten scholars visit campus, the search committee will begin to consider which four candidates to hire.
Gay said the Athletics Director search committee is currently assessing the needs of “constituencies and stakeholders.” She said there is no current timeline for the search.
“I think it’ll take as much time as it takes to get it right,” Gay said.
The DCE dean search committee is nearing the conclusion of its “listening” phase, according to Gay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Seeking to end the 2019-2020 season with a successful road trip this past weekend, Harvard halted its five-game losing streak with a 63-59 victory over Brown on Friday night. The Crimson looked to carry this momentum into its contest with archrival Yale on Saturday but came up short in a close 60-58 Ivy League battle.
HARVARD 63, BROWN 59 
Entering Friday night’s match up with Brown (8-18, 2-11 Ivy) was a Harvard squad (15-12, 6-8) hungry to move past its recent struggles and secure a win against the last-place conference foe. Freshman guard Lola Mullaney led the offensive effort with 17 points and 7 rebounds, and was joined in double figures by her sophomore backcourt partner Tess Sussman with a 13-point performance. Mullaney and Sussman combined for seven three-pointers, a clear indication that the shooting woes of previous weeks did not follow the Crimson to Providence.
After trading baskets with the Bears to start the first quarter, Harvard used an 11-1 run in the second to stretch its lead to a healthy 14 points. But just as the Crimson looked to grow this margin and carry a huge amount of confidence into halftime, a stretch of turnovers, foul trouble, and inefficient shooting sparked a 9-0 Brown run to cut the deficit to five.
“We played the first quarter the way we feel we should have played all year,” said coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “We played about half the second quarter that way, and then hit the wall. We got away from some stuff that we had been doing very, very well.”
Driving the first half lead was freshman guard Annie Stritzel, who tallied seven of her ten points in the second period. Stritzel’s solid play off the bench came on the heels of her career-high 18-point performance last weekend. As the season drew to a close and Delaney-Smith looked for consistent play from her reserves, the young and talented Stritzel was the one she turned to most.
“I think [Stritzel] has an incredible future, even though she’s a little nontraditional in how she plays,” said Delaney-Smith. “She has a tremendous heart, tremendous work ethic, and a great basketball IQ. [...] She became the sixth-player on the bench for us, and she does a great job of that.”
Harvard’s troubles late in the first half continued into the second, and, after being outscored 17-6 in the third quarter, the Crimson found itself trailing a Brown squad playing much better than the Bears’ record indicated. A three-point shot with seven minutes to play from junior forward Rachel Levy restored the Harvard lead, and her 17-rebound effort helped protect it until the final buzzer sounded, giving the Crimson the win it was desperate for.
HARVARD 58, YALE 60
Having recorded a home victory over Yale (19-8, 9-5) on February 7th, Harvard was determined to complete the season sweep and end its 2019-2020 campaign with a signature win against its foremost rival. Senior forward Jeannie Boehm paced the Crimson with a huge 19-point, 15-rebound performance in her final game in a Harvard jersey. Mullaney brought her recent hot shooting into New Haven as well, finishing with 16 points on four-of-seven shooting from beyond the three-point line.
The Crimson enjoyed its largest lead of the night in the first quarter, as three triples from Mullaney pushed Harvard to a 20-11 lead. Soon, however, the dynamic play of Yale’s senior guard Roxy Barahman settled her team into the contest. The rivals exchanged buckets through the rest of the half, making for a thrilling, hard-fought game that featured four ties and seven lead changes.
“Yale has all the pieces,” said Delaney-Smith. “They have a veteran team, they have a point guard [Barahman] that can score, they have an inside player that is very talented, they have a lights out shooter that we did a very good job on. They have a bunch of kids that are blue collar workers.”
After trailing by six points at halftime, a balanced scoring attack from all five starters produced a competitive third quarter in which each team scored 15 points. Rachel Levy continued her solid play from Friday, and her seven fourth quarter points led the Crimson as it erased the Yale lead down the stretch. Levy’s two free throws with 35 seconds remaining gave Harvard a 58-57 advantage, but a massive three-point shot from Yale put the Bulldogs on top 60-58 at the 30 second mark.
With one final possession left to determine the outcome of the game, a missed three pointer from Levy and a missed jump shot from Mullaney as time expired yielded raucous celebrations from the Yale bench.
“We got the shots we wanted to win the game,” said Delaney-Smith. “But again, its young kids taking the shot, rather than veterans taking the shot. [...] We need to get consistency. I thought everybody worked really, really hard, and we weren’t mistake free but we’re too young to be mistake free. [...] They’re great players, but we’ve struggled with consistency.”
Echoing what has been said about her team all year, Delaney-Smith views the Crimson’s biggest weakness this season to be its youth and inexperience. With four starters and a plethora of key reserves returning and a stellar recruiting class on its way to Cambridge, Delaney-Smith and her team will try to build off of their up-and-down Ancient Eight campaign as they head into the offseason.

If you’re fortunate enough to hear people chanting “E-L-I-O-T, you just won the lottery!” as they approach your door on the morning of Housing Day, you’ll be a part of the lucky group to be welcomed into this warm and buzzing House. With gorgeous, year-round views of the Charles River and festivities galore, Eliot House has it all. Here’s a toast to your new home, “Floreat domus de Eliot!”
All About Housing
As an incoming sophomore, you’ll most likely end up in n-1 suites, but suite setups can vary widely depending on which of the fifteen entryways (A-O) you belong to. Like most Houses, seniors and juniors have first pick in the lottery system, but Eliot sets aside certain suites in the House that are fully guaranteed for sophomores. Bathrooms are in-suite, and some even have three sinks, so rest assured that you’ll never have to set foot inside a hallway bathroom again.
If you’re looking for a place to party, Eliot’s got it all covered: the “Cockpit” in C Entryway has its own bar and pong table, and “Ground Zero” in the basement is another casual space for Eliotites and visitors alike to drop by and have a good time. To all the history lovers out there, these party suites were named after World War II lingo in honor of the air force pilots who took shelter in Eliot House during the war. So that means you can dance the night away feeling patriotic at the same time!
Eliot also comes fully equipped with fun amenities, from a dance studio in the basement and a music tower with Leonard Bernstein’s piano, to a darkroom for photography and even a woodshop where seniors build their own diploma frames! The dining hall is always a great place to chat with friends or grind on late night p-sets, and you’ll also find residents of the House flocking toward the ‘80’s-themed Grille for social gatherings or a quick bite before bedtime. Eliot also has a back gate where residents can swipe in. You can walk into Eliot’s spacious courtyard straight from Memorial Drive, a perfect addition for athletes and future SEAS concentrators coming from across the river.
Community
It’s no surprise that students in Eliot value community more than anything else. In addition to providing its expansive dhall as a common space for faculty dinners, daily meals, or casual meetups, sophomores also get to go on special outings. In the past, these activities have ranged from laid-back trips to Wards Berry Farm for ice cream to heated mini-golf tournaments between tutors and undergrads. With so many things to do and places to explore in the company of fellow Eliotites, you’ll be sure to feel at home.
At the end of every spring, Eliot hosts its annual Fête celebration, inviting students in the House to bring plus ones, kick back, and enjoy the fun. Lined with ice sculptures and champagne glasses, the dhall and JCR serve delicious food and drinks to the music of an indoor DJ and live band performing in the outdoor courtyard. In this night club/swing band atmosphere where disco meets groovy, Fête brings together the best of both old and new worlds.
Between formals every season, Eliot’s steins also serve as a great way to foster community. Some are holiday-themed, such as Jack-o-Lantern carving on Halloween-Eve, while others are more general, ranging from karaoke, speed-dating, and even painting Eliot tunnels.
Eliot has also been going strong in Intramural Sports this past year, placing top three in the recent dodgeball tournament. One of Eliot’s sources of pride is the Eliot Boat Club. Thanks to Eliot’s proximity to the Charles, the Boat Club stays committed throughout the year, training no matter the weather. For the same reason, you’ll often see athletes walking in and out of Eliot after practice (especially crew). This all goes to show that Eliotites have the mental and physical spirit to seize a decisive victory!
The Faculty Deans and tutors have also established a really close relationship with students. Although both Faculty Deans, Douglas “Doug” A. Melton and Gail O’Keefe, are expected to leave this year, House Committee co-chair Zach R. Fraley ‘21 expresses how much he’s appreciated having them around, saying that “Eliot’s amazing community will continue to grow thanks to all of their work and love for the House.”
Your Questions, Answered
We met with HoCo chairs Zach R. Fraley ‘21 and Jason S. Lee ‘21 to give us the inside scoop on Eliot.
What is the most common misconception people have about Eliot?
ZF: A lot of students will say Eliot is old and dingy, but the people and food definitely make up for it!
What makes the food at Eliot so good?
JL: Eliot is the HQ of Crimson Catering, which provides bread for the entire university as well as soup to the Berg.
Do you have anything else you want to say to first-year students who get Eliot?
Both: You just won the lottery!!

Though small in size, Kirkland is overflowing with spirit, puppies, and an overall sense of community! When you join K-House, quirky and spirited events like Secret Santa Week and Kirkland Drama Society productions are just the beginning to your charming new life by the River.
All About Housing
As a member of Kirkland, you’ll enjoy being tucked away into a cozy corner of the beautiful River West neighborhood. Situated near both Pinnochio’s and the Malkin Athletic Center, you are well on your way to living a balanced life of pizza and ellipticals over the next three years The Kirkland dining hall, however, is truly famous in its own right — read: gleaming white columns, glowing chandeliers, and dark wood tables). Sophomores typically live in suites of three to four with a common room and in-suite bathroom, making for a smooth transition from what is rather typical for a freshman set-up. If you’re up for it, though, look forward to the potential eight-man or 10-man suites, such as the famous B-51/52 10-men referred to lovingly as “the Beef.”
Within the small house, the best spots to hang out are centered around the tight-knit nature of the student community. Get ready to hit up the Grille not only for its delicious mozzarella sticks, but also as the location of frequent Steins and sports-viewing events, or the charming dining hall where you are guaranteed to see a familiar face. You can be seen there “p-setting or grabbing a nightly cup of cereal,” as House Committee co-chair Andrea J. Zhang ’22 says.
Craving some of that classic, old mahogany charm you expected Harvard to be all about? Kirkland’s John Hicks House, built in 1762 and named after one of the participants in the Boston Tea Party, is a beautiful library and hang-out space for Kirkland residents. The antique study space is transformed into a “Haunted Hicks” House during Halloween, making for a fun annual tradition that students look forward to each year.
Community
If you’re sorted into K-House, get ready for a true fanfare of love, community, and genuine House spirit. Zhang constantly reiterates the way in which one is “always surrounded by love” as one of the best things about the House. Don’t believe it? Wait until you get to Secret Santa Week.
“It’s the wildest thing at Harvard, it’s just nonsense,” claims Josh I. Stern ’21. During this house-wide event, over half of the students participate to some extent in making the wishes of their Secret Santees come true, ranging from marching band performances to surprising recipients with appearances of loved ones from back homes. If you’re looking for other ways to show House spirit, you can watch your fellow Kirklanders act out Shakespeare parodies as members of the Kirkland Drama Society, or let loose at the Winter Formal after-party, known to most as Incestfest (name subject to change), in the Beef.
Smaller touches and quirks help to make Kirkland a close-knit community. With both an impressive record of intramural victories and a wonderfully robust puppy population, Kirkland is truly the place to be. Tutors also help students feel supported and appreciated, hosting frequent discussions and Monday night book clubs with freshly baked cookies.
There is no end to the perpetual pride and fondness Kirklanders feel for their beloved home. The Kirkland Ode, chanted during dorm storming, perfectly summarizes that unique sense of belonging and family that only a few hundred lucky students are able to experience each year: “Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! You are so good to me. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! You are the place to be. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! Damn you are so fine. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! Thank God that you are mine.”
Your Questions, Answered
How would you describe Kirkland in three words?
AZ: Spirited...loving… [to friend passing by in the dining hall] Ben, want to help me of a word?
Ben A. Roy ’20: Definitely quirky.
If Kirkland were a fruit, what fruit would it be and why?
AZ: A small watermelon...it’s very sweet because Kirkland always fills us with love. You know when in the summer you take a bite of watermelon and it refreshes you? That's what coming from summer break back to Kirkland in the fall is like.
What was your biggest misconception about Kirkland as a freshman?
AZ: I just didn’t know what it was or what it had to offer...I feel like people place an undue weight on renovations...but House community and spirit are so much more important because that just shapes how I feel in the House.

Whether it be the lack of hallway doubles, the abundance of luxurious amenities, or the consistent social events, Winthrop has all that you can ask for and more. The warm, welcoming community Winthrop fosters will instantly create a home away from home. Winthrop House truly has it all. 
All About Housing
Along with the beautiful exterior of Winthrop comes some of the best housing this campus has to offer. House Committee co-chair Christopher M. Altizer ’21 says, “You’re either getting a hallway single — majority get hallways single — or, they’ll put you in a room with a double connected to another double.” In addition to hallway singles and 4-man suites, there are also 6-man, three doubles, and a common room, suites that may be available to sophomores, depending on what rooms are left after the juniors and seniors choose. “The common rooms are huge,” HoCo co-chair, Becca H. Amesbury ‘21, states. Altizer adds, “The common rooms are massive. They’re ridiculously, shockingly, large common rooms.” Sophomores are not confined to one area of Winthrop; rather, they can expect to be spread all throughout the House.
In addition to the solid sophomore housing situation, Winthrop also prides itself on the vast variety of amenities it offers, including a library, gym, art room, music rooms, the Barren rooftop common room, Junior Common Room, and Senior Common Room, all spread out evenly between Standish and Gore Hall. The JFK suite has also recently been remodeled, so that now it is a room to host a variety of Institute of Politics events and faculty talks, among other options. Whether you feel like playing pool, watching TV, or hanging out with some friends at the Lion’s Den, Winthrop has it all. To satisfy those late-night cravings, you can head to the Winthrop Grille which is always lively, or if you even feel like meditating, you can find your zen in the Meditation Room.
Community
Not only are Winthrop’s amenities truly fulfilling, but the House also boasts a welcoming community. “This House really means a lot to us. It’s completely changed my college experience. The community here is unlike any community I’ve had before...I could sit here and talk for years about how much I love this House and how much the community has done for me,” Altizer says. The faculty deans have played an important role in creating the community Winthrop sees today. Whether it be hanging artwork around the House, bringing Insomnia Cookies around the House during finals week, or simply giving you a hug in the dining hall, they are constantly putting in an effort to further strengthen the community Winthrop already exhibits. It doesn’t just end there though, according to students. The energy that they bring is reflected off to everyone else, including the House staff, dining hall staff, tutors, and the students. “They care so much about making it feel like home for every student,” Amesbury states.
HoCo chairs Altizer and Amesbury both urge freshmen to not be afraid to talk to upperclassmen and to get involved with the House. “Please come talk to us; we’re so excited to meet you,” Altizer says. But Amesbury adds in, “Don’t be afraid to sit in the dining hall by yourself.” Altizer says, “This community is really strong because of the people and how well we interact with each other.”
One of the most popular events that Winthrop hosts is their annual Throptoberfest, which is a one-day event that occurs in Winthrop Courtyard. In the past, Throptoberfest had a bouncy house, candy apple making, a variety of fall-themed drinks and food, lawn games, and a fall ivy-themed photo area. “We don’t really have a big all-campus event...but Throptober fest is becoming that...It’s so much fun and a lot of people ended up coming,” Amesbury remarks. Additionally, every other Thursday night, Winthrop hosts Steins in the Lion’s Den. With food, drinks, fun music, and a selection of themes, Steins prove to consistently be a good time.
As for intramurals, Winthrop has been doing fairly well. They are doing better than last year and are consistently improving. Winthrop won the Straus Cup a couple of years in a row.
Overall, Altizer confidently says, “Winthrop is on an upward trend and we’re nowhere near plateau. Period.”
Your Questions, Answered
We sat down with the HoCo chairs to get the inside scoops of life in Winthrop.
What is the biggest misconception about Winthrop?
CA: People think…that this house is very sterile.
BA: Oh yeah…
CA: They’ll say that it looks somewhat like a hotel, but, to be honest, I don’t know why they’re complaining.
If you were to describe Winthrop in three words, what would they be?
BA: Energy, Community, Home.
What is the most special part of Winthrop?
BA: I think our faculty deans. We have interim faculty deans right now, just for this year, but they have done so much to build the community of this House. Whether it’s their open houses, which they have very frequently…
CA: There’s one happening right now.
BA: Or, they come to our IM games, which is just the cutest thing, they’re always around in the dining hall talking to us...They’ve really helped make this place so special.

In what can only be described as dominant, the men’s squash team routed the competition at every step on their way to the CSA title from Feb. 28, 2020, to March 1, 2020, at the Harvard Murr Center. The team played Drexel, Princeton, and Penn on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday on its way to the championship, losing only one match over the entire weekend.


Playing on adjacent courts, George R. Crowne ‘22 and Timothy R. Brownell ‘20 both defeated their Drexel opponents in straight sets on Friday afternoon. In the quarterfinals, No. 1 Harvard won every match against No. 8 Drexel, setting up a semifinal matchup with No. 4 Princeton.


Before playing in the one spot, the top position in a squash lineup, Victor Crouin ’22 received some advice from teammates on his way back onto the court for his quarterfinal match against Drexel. Crouin dropped the first set of his match, one of only two that Harvard dropped the entire day, but roared back to win 3-1.


During his semifinal match, Saadeldin E. Abouaish ’20 returned a shot in the corner in front of the glass against Princeton. His match went almost twice as long as any other match of the day, as he battled back from down two sets to one to win his match in five sets, boosting the momentum of the charging Harvard squad.

 
Fans started to turn up in droves on Saturday to watch Harvard’s semifinal match. The team defeated No. 4 Princeton 9-0, setting up a grudge match for the finals on Sunday against No. 3 Penn.


Marwan Tarek ‘22, playing out of the two spot, started the championship day off on the glass court, defeating his Penn counterpart 3-0 to help Harvard jump out to an early lead.


Head coach Mike Way advised Victor Crouin ‘22 as Marwan Tarek ‘22 looked on during Crouin’s final round match. By the time Victor took the court around 3 p.m. on Sunday, Harvard needed only one more match in order to clinch the championship.

 
Victor Crouin '22 returned a tough shot in his finals-round match as his opponent looked on. The sophomore dropped the second set of the match but won the fourth set 16-14 to win his final match of the season. However, as his match had waged on, other matches around the Murr Center had already decided the tournament.


Samuel B. Scherl ’21 listened to assistant coach Hameed Ahmed and his teammates during his final match on Sunday. Scherl lost the first set but battled back to go up 2-1 going into the fourth set of the match.

 
Scherl clinched his final match with a dominant fourth set, giving Harvard an overall 4-0 lead over Penn. With one more win, Harvard would capture its second consecutive national championship.


The deciding win belonged, in the end, to Adam J. Corcoran ’21. With his four-set victory, Harvard won the CSA championship and mobbed Corcoran as he left the court.


The team looks on in awe at the championship trophy. The final score of the match on Sunday was 6-1. Over the course of 25 individual matches, Harvard only lost one.


At the end of the day, Harvard savored its hard-fought victory. The title wrapped up a dominant season for the team, and for the second straight year, the Crimson went into the off-season on top.
