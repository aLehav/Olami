After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are more than 400 officially recognized student organizations at Harvard, but not all of them get the attention they deserve. In these weekly profiles, the Arts Board takes a look at arts groups on campus. 
Established last fall, Harvard's Digital Art Club holds workshops on web design and software such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Interested students can freely attend their weekly meetings, held Wednesdays from 7 to 8 p.m. in Science Center 229.
 
"We definitely want to attract people to come out of the woodwork," said president of the club Helen Yung '13. "We know there's a lot of talent out there." The club, founded by Vivian Chi '12, fosters interest in digital media and allows members to explore those interests in their free time. For those not so savvy with the latest digital media, the club also creates fool-proof guides through highly detailed PDF tutorials on their website.
 
Despite its youth, the club already has affiliations with societies such as the Harvard Graphic Novel Society as well as Harvard-based and local businesses seeking graphics, logo or web designs for high-octane, unique advertisements. 
 
Yung and co-president Shirley Zhou '13, plan to attract a greater freshmen base and hope to emphasize a greater focus on collaborative Art Labs. The club is also planning to issue a publication in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It seems odd that the debate over the bounds of decency on Halloween, particularly with regards to women’s costumes, is reignited year after year. Halloween is enjoyable for most people precisely because it is an opportunity when we are free to break social conventions and to fulfill fantasies of being someone or something else, without any worries of reprisal. It should not be surprising that on a college campus like Harvard’s, where all are hyper-aware of social pressures regarding appearance, this manifests itself on “Halloweekend” in the form of overtly sexual costumes.
As would be true at any time of the year, costumes that explicitly aim to mock racial or cultural groups are lacking in judgment. This is because in this case the costume functions less as a form of imaginative self-expression, and more as a form of reinforcing damaging prejudices and power dynamics. The costume is in no way liberating—it is harmful both to its wearer and its viewers.
On the other hand, suggestive costumes are just as valid an expression of creative wish fulfillment as frightening ones are. The choice to dress up as a sexy cop involves a person’s desire to inhabit a new identity for just one night. In a society where bodies and physical appearance are subject to high levels of scrutiny, it may be a positively liberating experience for many. Such a costume choice is a conscious decision to flout a suffocating and restrictive society.
Journalist Sarah Seltzer voiced this sentiment recently, pointing out how “Women in contemporary society navigate tricky rules for our appearances: we are instructed to be sexually appealing, but not overtly sexy, and never unkempt. Too much makeup or cleavage throws us in an unflattering light—too little and we’re unfeminine or ‘don’t take care of ourselves.’” As a result, the freedom granted to women during Halloween offers the opportunity “to abandon all pretenses at beauty by becoming literally monstrous, or alternately to reach campy skin-bearing heights that would be frowned-upon in the light of day.”
It is our continual urge to moralize on the subject of sexualized costumes that should give us pause, rather than the costumes themselves. Of course, the objectification of women is bad, but choosing an extroverted appearance on the one night of the year when women hope they won’t be judged does not count. It is a society well conditioned to repression, and well accustomed to patriarchal moralizing, that attempts to clamp down on Halloween attire. If the holiday becomes subject to the same social strictures that bind our everyday behavior, it will not be of pleasure to children, college students, or adults. The lack of shame felt when dressing freely on Halloween ought to be protected to the utmost. Perhaps most worrisome is that such freedom only exists on one day of the year.

More proof that candy and costumes trump all, including civil society: 71 percent of Americans told pollsters they planned on celebrating Halloween this year; 57 percent of voting-age Americans cast a ballot in 2008. Is that cause for worry? I’m not sure about the Halloween half of the story. Its upshot—that 71 percent of Americans shovel time and money into make-believe costumes and youth sugar consumption—probably says something worth considering. But the other half, the voting turnout, says something murkier still.
Voter turnout looks low. In United States presidential elections, despite an uptick in recent years, it has oscillated in the fifties (or slightly higher if, more accurately, the voting-eligible population is considered). That marks a far cry from a bygone 19th century plateau of well over 70 percent. Still, that plateau provides an initial caution: high turnout is no panacea for democratic well-being. The 1800s’ perennial turnout “success” arrived as a product of well-rooted political machines in an era (late century, primarily) when parties increasingly delineated spoils allocation instead of ideology.
That’s not to say low turnout is desirable, of course. Maybe a less apathetic few can make sager decisions in the short term, yet in the long term we should probably hope for a more engaged, informed, higher-turnout populace. But whatever the case, this discussion assumes something basic. It assumes that turnout is in fact low. Is it? Not if a vote’s chance of mattering is effectively zero. Any turnout at all is something to marvel at, if voting is irrational.
And it might be irrational. One study of the 2008 election placed the odds of a decisive vote (state election tied or decided by one vote) at one in 60 million. That is, even if an Obama or Romney victory triggered an immediate $600,000 payout to the decisive voter, the “expected value” of a vote—the vote’s potential benefit multiplied by its probability of decisiveness—would still measure one measly cent. And yet voting has its costs. Average voter waiting times in 2008 were about 16.5 minutes across the country, but often higher—in 2004, some Ohio voters waited as long as 12 hours to cast their votes. Factoring in travel times and forgone wages, surely more than a cent’s worth, tips the scale against voting’s logic. Even the postage on an absentee ballot likely far exceeds the expected value of any one citizen’s vote.
Despite all that, nearly 130 million Americans voted in 2008. That means a majority of U.S. adults appear wildly irrational. (Perversely, then, non-voters must be the wise, logical sorts we should want voting.) Economists remain in search of a comprehensive theory to explain this beyond scapegoating ignorance or irrationality. Proposed explanations are varied. Perhaps voters derive value from voting qua voting—whether an inner, buoyant feeling of civic virtue or an external brag of patriotism to friends and coworkers. Alternatively (or additionally), voters might also seek to prevent a rueful worst-case scenario—a favored candidate’s preventable one-vote loss—rather than to maximize “expected value” across all scenarios. Maybe voters care about victory margins, enlarging a candidate’s mandate or limiting a candidate’s loss. Or, on a related note, voters might value turnout; a larger turnout increases the perceived legitimacy of a winner’s win. Under this impulse, the Soviet Union consistently coerced voter turnout well beyond Western democracies’ to bolster its pre-concluded elections.
This reasoning, however, remains clouded with “mights” and “maybes”—the research lacks a clear, canonical model. But what about a more pointed, related question, at the individual level: Should you vote? Some hold that we should appreciate and exercise our right at the ballot box, especially because so many individuals around the world cannot do so. But voting is a right, not a duty or obligation. The First Amendment doesn’t imply a duty to exercise religion or assemble; the 21st Amendment doesn’t imply a duty to drink liquor. If voting isn’t a duty, and if it isn’t strictly beneficial to the rational citizen either, that does not leave much.
It does leave me, though. I am voting, and even wilder, I am voting in New Jersey, home to 14 foregone conclusions otherwise called my state’s Electoral College votes. Maybe I’m deceiving myself, but at least I have concocted a couple of reasons. Reason number one: I am motivated by the “civic virtue” benefit referenced by economics—voting makes me feel active, in solidarity with my peers. Logical or not, that is reality. Reason number two: in his movie “Love and Death,” Woody Allen’s lead character nicely phrases it for me, explaining why he refrains from suicide despite his atheism: “I’d hate to blow my brains out and then read in the papers they found something.”
That’s the point mentioned above, minimizing worst-case scenarios. My worst-case scenario is learning that, against one-in-six-million odds, the national election was decided by a one vote margin in one state, New Jersey. For that, I’ll mark up a ballot. Delusional? Maybe. But here’s another statistic to go with the Halloween and voting percentages. According to Gallup, 59 percent of American adults buy a lottery ticket each year, just a hair above 2008’s election turnout number. Lottery tickets are losers’ bets, no doubt. Still, like candy and costumes, they are fun. Call that reason number three.

To the editor:
I’m writing because I feel ethically obliged to disabuse fellow Crimson readers at Harvard of Chloe S. Maxmin’s perpetuation of the spoiler myth in her opinion piece published on October 30 (Beware the Spoiler Effect). The record about the 2000 election needs to be set straight once and for all. Those who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 did not steal votes from Al Gore. First, it’s worth noting that Gore’s choice of Joe Lieberman as his Vice Presidential running mate alienated many voters. The fact that Gore distanced himself from Clinton only added insult to injury. Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes but the Supreme Court, which was right-leaning at the time, overruled Florida’s Supreme Court decision to count all the votes. This was the reason Bush was elected. Note that this was the fourth time in U.S. history that a president was elected without having won the popular vote (the first three times were in 1824, 1876, and 1888). Those who voted for Nader were Independents and disillusioned Democrats who most likely would not have voted at all if they hadn’t had another option besides Gore. I will reiterate: Nader did not spoil the election in 2000!
As for Dr. Jill Stein ’73, an alumna of both Harvard College and Harvard Medical School, it’s worth mentioning that she was arrested yesterday for delivering food and supplies to climate activists in Texas. Recently, she was also arrested for merely showing up to one of the mainstream presidential debates. This past summer she was arrested for protesting against foreclosure abuse in Philly. Any discerning reader will see the pattern here. Without fail, every time Dr. Stein dares to be a voice for progressive change in this country, she is thrown behind bars. In what kind of democracy does a presidential candidate get arrested for showing up to a presidential debate?
She may not win the presidency, as the system is rigged against third-party candidates, but if she amasses enough support in this election (i.e., five percent of the popular vote), the Green Party will receive $20 million in public funds and increased ballot access for its 2016 presidential bid. There is no excuse to vote for Obama in uncontested states, red or blue. In our state of Mass., Obama is going to win regardless, so a vote for Jill Stein won't detract from him and would definitely help the Green Party in the future. In a red state, there's no chance that voting for Obama will tip the scale so if you believe in Jill Stein, you might as well vote your conscience. There's strength in numbers and we need to be strong in 2016! The only wasted vote is a vote for Obama or Romney because it will just bring about more of the same. If you’re a U.S. citizen in a non-swing state (whether you're voting here in Mass. or absentee elsewhere) and you consider yourself to be progressive, liberal, or a disillusioned Democrat, I urge you to "waste" your vote on Jill Stein if you want real, meaningful change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The online magazine “The Harvard Voice” was the talk of the town recently thanks to an offensive post by an anonymous blogger about Asian students at recruiting events. The crème de la crème of the post’s racist descriptions of Asians include, “they're practically indistinguishable from one another, but it’s okay” and that they “talk in the same sort-of gushy, sort-of whiny manner, and have the same concentrations and sky-high GPAs.”
Harvardians were outraged. The Crimson article covering the post immediately shot to the top of the website’s most read list. The editors of The Voice initially edited and later took down the offensive passage about Asians, amending the post to include the following: “We deeply apologize if this article has offended some of our readers…we have removed the inappropriate content because it is not in line with The Voice‘s mission of promoting satirical, yet inclusive, content.”
But isn’t it? I thought the point of satirical websites was to be satirical. The post was clearly not ill intentioned or meant to offend. It merely poked fun at an oft-ridiculed stereotype in order to lighten the serious tone of recruiting season. Let’s be honest here. You have likely cracked an “Asians study too hard” or “Asians are good at math” joke at least once in your lifetime, and if you haven’t, you have surely heard one. But admittedly, the stereotype that all Asians and Asian Americans are good at mathematics, have high grades, and only study, amongst many other stereotypes, is offensive, unfair and, to a large extent, unjustified.
But while I wish we lived in a post-racial society and a racism-free world, I am afraid that we do not. All of us can be excessively sensitive when it comes to race. I am not defending racism, nor am I arguing that people should not be upset by racist jokes. Everyone has the right to be offended by something that is implicitly or explicitly discriminatory. But I am arguing that an effective way to tackle racism is through racist jokes like the very one published in The Voice.  We need a practical solution to racism, and race-based humor and embracing stereotypes is a great way to conquer racism.
The more jokes we make, the more we can air out the absurdity of some of the racial stereotypes that persist in society. The next time someone cracks a joke about your ethnic background, laugh it off. Maybe even drop a few racist jokes of your own. An embrace of stereotypes and use of humor has successfully been used by minority groups to combat discrimination in the past. Although the experiences of these minority groups are not always comparable due to the different cultural and historical backgrounds of each group, there are lessons from history still worth learning.
Legendary Jewish comedians like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks have made fun of stereotypes of Jewish facial characteristics and personalities in their films and stand up gigs. Now these insults, which used to be widespread misconceptions of how to identify Jewish people, are far less pervasive. Human Rights Watch helps sponsor humorous videos in Lebanon featuring racist jokes about domestic helpers. There are 200,000 foreign workers in Lebanon, most of whom are Sri Lankan, Filipino, and Ethiopian. Many of these workers suffer abuse by their employers due to racism. The series has helped expose the ridiculousness behind ethnic stereotypes directed at these domestic helpers.
Recently, several students published an op-ed criticizing The Voice for propagating a false image of Asian Americans. I beg to differ. I think that the post on The Voice’s blog does quite the opposite, as it reveals what the false stereotype of Asians truly is: just a joke.
The root of racism is ignorance. Jokes can do a lot to expose the ignorance behind many of the stereotypes that persist in our society in a safe, non-violent way. Through humor, we can reveal these stereotypes for what they really are—unfair expressions of frustration against minority groups. I, along with many other Asian students here at Harvard, am definitely guilty of “self-racism.” Cracking jokes about ourselves and our ethnic stereotypes shows the racists that we are comfortable with who we are and that their ignorance has no effect on us.

 “My first year, he was the guy I was competing with. I was competing with him, but I was also learning a lot from him.
The dynamic’s great. We complement each other very well. I’m more vocal on the court, Webby will probably be a little more vocal in the locker room. There’s not one of us that has a bigger role than the other one. He’s really competitive—it’s hard to say who’s more competitive.
We were both here this summer because we’re on some different program than the other guys. He started benching more than me. I wasn’t so proud of it. We’re on the same level now since I caught up to him, which is cool, because we don’t have to change the weights. We can just lift together without having to change the weights every time.
I think I met him prefrosh weekend. I was already committed, so we were hanging out as friends, playing video games and just chilling. It was like, ‘this guy’s cool,’ ‘this guy’s kind of like me,’ you know. We both play the same video games. I would say I’m better at FIFA.
Sometimes I could get excited before games, and when we were roommates at the hotel, I would start listening to French rap and start rapping in French and he would be like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ He would call everyone and go, ‘Laurent’s going nuts!’ Rapping in French and shit—that’s something I used to do. He’d look at me and be like, ‘What the hell are you singing?’
I don’t know if anything surprises me about him anymore. I know him well—this is our third year we’re spending together. We’re together pretty much every day. I’m a big fan of country, and Webby actually likes Rascal Flatts. Well that’s a surprising moment we shared. We were in a car driving together, and I was listening to country. Usually people complain, but he was like, ‘That’s my song!’ I was like, ‘Wait really?’ and he was like, ‘Yeah, I love Rascal Flatts!’ I barely listen to rap anymore, so it’s just country and chill music. And Taylor Swift.
I think the other team members would say that we’re good friends and that we get along well. Which is not surprising, but it might be a little impressive since we’re at the same position and have to compete for the same spot, same minutes. In some programs, some guys come in as freshmen and see a guy as a threat, like, ‘Oh he can take my minutes. I’m not going to help him out. I’m not going to give him advice.’ But he’s never done that, and for me, it was really important because I looked at how he played and looked up to him my first year since he was having a really good season and he never shut me out or anything. I think that guys recognized that, and there’s none of that on our team.”
 Christian Webster ’13
“Everyone calls me ‘Webby.’ One of our basketball managers calls Laurent ‘The Vampire.’ I think it’s because—is someone on Twilight named Laurent? So sometimes, if I want to mess with him, I’ll call him a vampire.
This summer, we were running sprints with Coach Frasier, our strength coach, and every day would just be really hard sprints. Then this one day it was really easy, I guess ’cause it was so hard every day. Me and Laurent, we had our shoes off on the football field, and we were just joking around ’cause it was so easy. It was a lot of downs and turns, like 20 yards and back, 20 yards and back, something like that, but this day was just straight, just sprint straight. So we would just run, like, do a circle, and then keep running, just messing around. We were running in circles and still making the times, which really pissed Coach Frasier off.
I think we are both really hardworking and we invest a lot in basketball and it really shows in our game. With me being a senior, I think I take more of a vocal role, just ’cause I’ve been here one more year, and I know a little bit more. But Laurent, he’s more of a guy who leads by example and that’s really worked for him, and it’s worked so far for us so it’s been good.
He’s probably the best shooter I’ve ever played with and I think that’s just because of his work ethic, he works so hard at everything. He has a good basketball IQ, he’s a good teammate, and a good thing for one to be a captain is that you have to listen well. Some guys would be like, ‘Oh, you’re telling me? I’m the captain.’ But he’s not like that at all. If any of our players has something to say, he’ll listen.
Laurent lived in the Quad last year, too, and we spent a lot of time together because the Quad’s like its own community. The Quad is…it’s a struggle for an athlete ’cause it’s so far, like it’s a 30-minute walk to get here. For school, I like it because it’s almost as if I’m going to school every day. I hear a lot of people in the quad say ‘I’m going home,’ but I hear a lot of people in the river say, ‘I’m going back to my room.’ I don’t know, it’s a whole different feeling that you get in the quad, and I kind of like it. Except when I wake up, it’s 6:00 a.m., and there’s no shuttles…and I have to walk. [chuckles] Then I don’t like that it’s far.
I’ve thought about what would it be like if I didn’t play sports here, but I love basketball so much that it’s like, I mean, it’s all I’ve ever done. I’m not afraid of change. Change is good. Change is always good. Change is hard, but it’s good. It’s what we signed up for.”

Tired of analyzing poll after poll? Sick of combing your inbox for the latest IOP spam emails? Fed up withwatching a live feed of an Ohio community center voting booth? Predicting election results can be tough,especially when political pundits can’t agree on the answer. Never fear, FM is here to outline the "real"determining factors of this year’s election.
SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS
First things first: It’s highly unlikely that candidatesactually made these playlist. A tech-savvy aide or internmost likely slapped the songs together, but it can beassumed that each candidate got to look it over, so it’s perfectlylegitimate to predict the election based on the musicaltastes implied. As women’s rights is a key issue this election,the predominant gender of the artists on the playlists mayprovide some insight. Obama’s “2012 Campaign Playlist”features multiple female singers such as Jennifer Hudson,Florence Welch, and Joss Stone, whereas, despite all hisbinders full of them, Romney’s playlist “On the Road” onlyshowcases one song by a female artist: Carrie Underwoodbelting about being an “All-American Girl...” a very bad signfor supporters of Planned Parenthood.
OFFSPRING
Let’s face it, the first family can be just as important toAmericans as the candidates themselves. In one corner, wehave the five Romney sons. There’s Tagg, Matt, Josh, Ben,and Craig. All are grown men with successful careers andsolidly American names. In the other corner of the ring, wehave the President’s two daughters, Malia and Sasha, whotap dance, and play soccer and gymnastics. If you preferno-nonsense, middle-aged men dressed in designer suitswith slicked back hair, it looks like Romney wins this round.But if you’ve been taken in by the youth, energy, and tapdancing feet of the two Obama girls, then it looks like thePresident is ready for his second term on the national stage.
TASSEOGRAPHY
Still having trouble picking a winner? Ask the spirits! Forthose unacquainted with the time-honored tradition of tealeafreading, it’s a precise art that requires a careful eye andthe proper equipment. Start by ripping open a tea bag andpouring it into a paper cup. Pour hot water on top, drinkthe tea, swirl, and you’re ready to see the future.If your apparatus was correctly set up you should seeclumps and smudges of tea leaves on the bottom and sidesof your cup. Your job is to determine what those shapesmean. Dressage horses and Clint Eastwood are votes forSenator Romney, Big Bird and bayonets bode well forPresident Obama. A large, phallic dragon locked in combatwith a winged liger ridden by the members of One Directionmeans you should probably seek professional help. Ifyou’re having trouble making sense of the splotches in frontof you, try squinting, tilting your head slightly to the right,and chanting softly. It may or may not help. At the very leastyou’ll look like you know what you’re doing.

FM firmly believes that every task, even the weighty one of exercising your citizenlyrights by voting in the presidential election, is improved with auditory accompaniment.These songs will have you tapping your feet all the way to the polls.
 “That Was the President” by Phil Ochs
Protest singer Ochs penned this song in tribute toJFK in 1965, and it’s perfect for inducing an atmosphereof patriotic nostalgia. Ochs’ earthy vocalswill make an impassioned voter of even the mostdedicated cynic.
 “Election Day” by The Replacements
Maybe you’re not a U.S. Citizen. Maybe youreally, really meant to send that registrationform in, but it got buried under a pile of gradedpsets. Maybe you just don’t “care who getselected/’til [you] find [yourself] a one to love.”This is an appropriately moody track for lyingon your bed in the dark while your roommatehobnobs with politicos at the Warren campaignwatch party.
 “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen
President Ronald Reagan famously referencedthis song in an 1984 campaign speech, much to thedisgust of the liberal Springsteen. Whatever yourpolitics, it’s hard not to sing along to the rousingchorus.
 “People Have the Power” by Patti Smith
In this unabashedly hopeful anthem of democracy,Smith reminds us that we have “the power todream, to rule, to wrestle the world from fools.” OnElection Day, we can all feel like gov. concentrators.
 “Letter to the President” by 2Pac + Outlawz
Nothing fuels righteous political fervor like ninetiesrap. Sometimes the best way to get active is to getangry.

Sitting cross-legged with a steaming mug of tea tucked between her hands, Kirin Gupta ’16 has her body set in a picture of relaxation. Her face, with eyes locked and mouth stuck in a tight-lipped smile, betrays the seriousness of the topic. She answers questions candidly but with authority, her voice cracking when she talks about the problems she perceives as a member of the Student Labor Action Movement (SLAM).
“I think the most important thing that a Harvard student or anyone of this kind of educational and sociopolitical privilege can do is give a voice to people who are systematically disenfranchised by the very system from which they have benefited,” Gupta says. She hesitates a second and then clarifies, “I mean disenfranchised in the sense of not having a say in their negotiations and not having a real say in the issues that pertain to their own lives.”
When asked about how SLAM gets workers to come out to their protests, Gupta interrupts.
“I take offense to that question,” she says. “I don’t think of it as them at our protests. I think of it as us at their protests.”
SLAM is the most prominent labor group on campus. It coordinates with employees and activists to support workers’ rights and, most recently, it has organized protests regarding the delayed contract negotiations between the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers (HUCTW) and the University, as well as the alleged workplace sexual assault of Johany Pilar, a mailroom worker who claimed coworkers brutally forced themselves upon her.
HUCTW is a large and active union on campus, consisting of over 4,000 members who are mostly librarians, faculty assistants, and other administrative employees. Contract negotiations began in April and have been ongoing ever since. Although the negotiations are closed-door, HUCTW names the primary areas of contention as health care benefits, the collective bargaining rights of Harvard’s employees, and salary increases—at a minimum, HUCTW is looking for raises corresponding with inflation rates.
Members of SLAM emphasized the amount of influence that students wield in the interactions between the University and various unions.
“When students stand with workers it becomes easier for the Harvard community to put pressure on the Harvard administration to negotiate constructively for a fair and just contract,” says Clio Griffin ’15, a member of SLAM. Griffin notes that many students support HUCTW’s efforts, pointing to a petition from a few weeks ago that over 400 students signed in support of HUCTW’s contract negotiations.
Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, who wrote an editorial in The Crimson detailing the status of HUCTW’s labor negotiations and calling for student aid in the protests, says that student communication with workers should not be limited to only supporting them in their campaign for a new contract.
“The interaction doesn’t have to come through SLAM. It’s a matter of talking to people who work in my house, talking to dining hall workers, treating them like real people and interacting with them,” Blecher-Cohen says. “They kind of ground us in that this is their real world perspective. You definitely don’t have to be in SLAM to seek out that kind of perspective.”
For some students, HUCTW’s contract negotiations can seem like a distant issue, but again and again, members of SLAM emphasize the importance of student involvement and activism in the issue.
“I think a lot of it is a matter of simple outreach. I think a lot of students on campus don’t necessarily know what’s happening with the unions,” Blecher-Cohen says. “It’s incredibly valuable to think of the Harvard community as being beyond students and faculty and thinking of all the people on campus that help it function.”
As a nonprofit institution, Gupta says that Harvard’s labor negotiations are seen in a very different light than other for-profit big businesses. Although the current standoff between Harvard and HUCTW is tense, Gupta cedes that the University has been amiable to student demands in the past.
“Harvard is flexible to an extent,” Gupta says. “But there is a point at which that ends, and that is not the right point today with a lot of what’s going on, especially with HUCTW. Being a nonprofit employer affects your negotiations with workers in what you can claim at the negotiation table. It definitely matters in the sense that a nonprofit employer is expected to have a less antagonistic relationship with its employees.”
According to Brianna J. Suslovic ’16, Harvard’s status as a nonprofit has less of an effect on the negotiations because—although the primary purpose of the university is educational in nature—there is a corporation component to the university.
“It is important to keep in context that these universities in the United States are considered nonprofits but are huge employers and parts of the community that they are within,” Suslovic says. “Regardless of the fact that Harvard is a nonprofit, there is still money flowing and that takes precedence for me over the fact that it is a nonprofit organization. I think within the University there is a lot of redistribution of money, and I think regardless, when money and labor are involved, it’s important to keep fair treatment, stuff like fair hours and pay, at the forefront of negotiations.”
Asked about why he fights for labor rights, Blecher-Cohen takes a second to think. Pursing his lips, Blecher-Cohen is briefly at a lost for words. After composing his thoughts, Blecher-Cohen relaxes and begins to speak.
“These worker negotiations don’t exist in a vacuum and the status of these workers affects them every day,” Blecher-Cohen says. “Harvard is first and foremost a school and the fact that the students can demonstrate that they care about these issues and that they support the workers has a very profound effect. As the biggest consumer of the school, if students can voice that they have an interest in the negotiations then that can spur a lot of dialogue.”

In November 2000, Richard M.J. Maopolski ’14 watched mesmerized as candidate George W. Bush battled his way to the White House. Maolpolski was hooked. From then on, campaigns and politics fascinated him. As television clips showed the president stand amidst the rubble of the Twin Towers on September 11, Maopolski’s own politics were cemented. From 2001, he supported President Bush.
These political tendencies and his interest in the presidency continued up to the 2004 election. While other 13 year olds spent their nights watching Cartoon Network, Maopolski spent his scanning the polls.
But, starting in 2006, Maolpolski’s views began to shift. Influenced by the politics of Robert F. Kennedy ’48 and the anti-war movement, Maopolski began to question his own support for Bush. One event confirmed this reversal: Maopolski saw Obama open a Monday Night Football game with the Bears, and Obama’s style immediately engaged him. He began to campaign for Obama by canvassing and attending rallies.
“I thought he would do what was best for our generation in the long run,” Maopolski said, speaking from Scranton, Pa., where he is taking time off from Harvard to work on his start-up company, OpptIn. Maolpolski plans to return to Harvard next semester.
Enthusiasm for politics is hardly uncommon among Harvard students. Maopolski’s aspirations fit into a long and illustrious tradition: eight U.S. presidents graduated from Harvard College, law school, or business school. Both current presidential candidates hold Harvard degrees. But Maopolski’s story illustrates the erratic path behind the polish of the classic politician’s story—though he has always maintained an interest in politics, his political beliefs themselves have varied drastically through the years.
Still, Maopolski’s general passion for all things political continued through the beginning of his freshman year, when he began to talk to classmates about the possibility of extending their interest in politics. Rumors circulating around the organization dubbed it the “Presidents’ Club.”
Though Maopolski did not exactly create an exclusive association for future presidents, he did bring together professors and students in the first part of his time at Harvard, in the hopes of creating a space for political dialogue. “The best thing we did was sort of get together with different professors to have conversations,” he said.
“We just spent time talking about this stuff,” he added, “and not just who wants to be in political office, but about journalism, media, and everything.” Maopolski supplemented these conversations with classes with Professors Roger B. Porter and Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo, which increased his awareness of foreign policy and the economy.  Working with Diaz, Maopolski began to do research on the National Security Directives from John F. Kennedy’s term up to that of George W. Bush. The Institute of Politics provided a further space for his opinions to develop.
This involvement provoked yet another shift in Maopolski’s political opinions. “My politics hit a brick wall again,” said Maopolski, “when I ended up in the classroom with several Obama professors and chased down by health care lobbyists.” Harvard’s liberal reputation, as well as discussions with professors about issues facing America, contributed to Maopolski’s growing disillusionment with Obama.
“I became very numb to it all,” he said, “and wondered if the whole system was broken and my dream job was actually a curse.”
Such frustrations with the political system eventually led Maopolski to pinpoint his disenchantment in the environment of extreme liberals—not moderates or conservatives. He began, instead, to piece together an independent ideology.
Maopolski was conflicted, though, because of his own experience growing up with a single parent. “I grew up in public schools, a few years of government housing, and even government health care,” he said, “but I realized no amount of money can guarantee a student or citizen the ability to take responsibility for themselves.”
He added, “There needs to be help, but I saw far too much abuse.”
Maopolski had been working for the Obama campaign since December 2011. After two months on the trial, and re-formulating his own beliefs once again, he quit the campaign.
However, politics is still never far from Maopolski’s thoughts. He wants to attendgraduate school, possibly a combination of business or law. But he is certain that Washington D.C. will be his final destination, whatever the position—and whatever the party.
“Will I run for office?” Maopolski said. “I’ve always thought about it.” He added, “Is that the only thing I could do in life? No.”
Still, Maopolski admitted, “I would be lying to you if I didn’t say that I haven’t dreamt about the presidency since I was ten.”

David N. Damrosch, Department Chair of Comparative Literature, joined Harvard’s faculty three years ago. Soon after arriving, he purchased this home on a quiet street behind the Graduate School of Design. He only spends some time here, however: He commutes back and forth between Cambridge and New York, where his wife continues to live and teach.
THE CRIB: A relatively traditional, three-story home.  Four bedrooms, three bathrooms.
LOCATION: Cambridge, Mass.
“This is my primary residence—I vote here—but I’m all over the place. I’m there [New York] as much as I am here, so the idea of this was to be a fairly modest place that would be really close to campus,” Damrosch says.
And it is. The house is beautiful and well kept, suggesting traditionalism with a pinch of exotic flair. Amidst spotless living spaces lie relics from Damrosch’s travels, which—considering he works regularly in 12 languages—have been quite extensive.
Damrosch’s travels have defined the way that he lives, taking him to places as far as Iran and North Vietnam. “As a guy of my generation, I didn’t think I’d see either of those places deliberately in my lifetime. But they were very hospitable.”“It hasn’t had time to get too messy yet,” he adds while showing me inside.
THE LIVING ROOM
Upon entering, the first striking feature is a stuffed animal sitting on the mantle. According to Damrosch, the brown, furry creature is a mongoose, placed as a reminder of a book that he recently wrote, a discussion of the “Epic of Gilgamesh.”
“I started off a chapter with a king who is really freaked out because he is going out on his chariot and a mongoose runs underneath the chariot. So my wife gave me the mongoose to coincide with the publication of the book.”
But as Damrosch says, “in a way, the art is the most interesting.” Above the mantle, a different sort of masterpiece resides, this one made by Damrosch himself. The hand-drawn circular maze looks as if it could have come out of “The Lord of the Rings.” Perfectly straight lines intersect with each other seamlessly, and the entire design has the feel of an ancient document that should be kept behind glass.
To Damrosch it is just another memory. He drew it as a teenager. “I was obsessed at that time with Tolkien,” he tells me as he points to the ring of gibberish going around the maze. “I think this is one of his [Tolkien’s] poems that I transliterated into Elvish. It took a few weeks.”
Damrosch is next drawn to a watercolor painting on the shelf, made by his mother in the forties or fifties. He explains how he found this particular painting purely by chance. “After she had died, I was cleaning out her house. And everything was gone, and as I was walking out the door for the last time, there was this high shelf where I couldn’t see. And I just put my hand up there and there was this.”
THE DINING ROOM
It doesn’t seem like Damrosch eats in the dining room much, but this space is one of the most intriguing in the house. A series of watercolors painted by Damrosch’s great aunt Helen, his favorite relative, decorate the walls. “She was a very cool lady. Very adventurous. She used to paint underwater, because the fish would lose their color. So she would sketch them in oils wearing a diving helmet, then come up and finish painting.”
Like his Aunt Helen, Damrosch’s other family members have created works of art that are also displayed around the house. He laughs: “In our family the black sheep go into business.” Damrosch himself no longer draws or paints. “The words took over,” he tells me.
After pointing out faded photographs of his great-great-grandfather (who looks surprisingly similar to Karl Marx) and various other family members, he stops at a signed photograph of a man unrelated to the Damrosch family, given to him by Aunt Helen. “Every time I’d go see her, when she was in her seventies, she’d have another story of a different person she knew.”
Damrosch looks at the photo for another second. “So I’m using this to kind of remember her a little bit.”
UPSTAIRS
As he walks up a narrow but elegantly carpeted set of stairs, Damrosch pauses for a moment to look at a framed Gilbert and Sullivan poster in front of him. “My wife and I met in a trial production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s ‘Trial by Jury.’ For my Gen Ed course, I had to decide whether to read Plato’s ‘Republic’ or try out for this production, so I of course made the non-platonic choice. And there I met my wife.”
Turning to his left, Damrosch looks at another piece of art, a picture of a Nefertiti bust from the Egyptian Museum in Berlin. “I took the picture when I was there one time,” he tells me. “I was struck by the fact that she’s enclosed in a glass case. From a right angle it looks as if she’s contemplating herself eternally.” Nefertiti seems to be looking at her own reflection, deep in thought.
After exploring his own study, where he casually points out a framed picture of himself playing Frisbee with Jimmy Carter, Damrosch moves down the hall to the room where his wife works.“
In the Victorian houses, like our place in Brooklyn, everything is set up for the separation of the sexes—two master bedrooms, two dressing rooms. In the modern era, you want one bedroom, but two studies.” Both rooms are quite sparse, the former decorated with boxes of papers and the latter with heavy books on international law.
Yet, sparse would not be a fitting word to describe Damrosch. As chair of the Department of Comparative Literature, he reads, writes, and works with students in many languages. Damrosch makes clear the importance of working in the original language of a text.
“At a certain point, I get frustrated being separated from the text by a translation. At some point you want to get closer to the original.”
This seems to be a metaphor for Damrosch’s lifestyle—he wants to be as close as possible to what’s important, be it his family, his art, or his work. He smiles as he looks out the front window to see the towering Memorial Hall, contemplating his home.“It’s not large, not fancy, but very convenient. We get the Harvard WiFi in the front of the house. We’re really right there, you see.”

Dear “Dear Readers” Readers,
I have a confession to make. The truthis that I write the weekly weather reviewonly halfway through the last week thatI’m currently reviewing. Consequentlythis means that I generally have to guesswhat the weather will be later in thisweek’s Last Week in order to write eachweek’s weekly weather review. Yes, I realizethat in doing this, I am inadvertentlypredicting the weather—my bad. Butwhen you have a Sunday deadline andno friends, what else can you do? Shrug.
Anyway, because of my temporal dissonance,I’ve been put into the difficultposition this week of having to predictthe extent to which Hurricane Chandyhas fucked shit up in Cambridge longbefore the hurricane has actually gottenhere. So to save myself the trouble ofproducing an incorrect weather report,I’m just going to write two reports andhope that at least one of these is applicable,if not both. No class on Mondaymeans I have more time to waste onthese, anyway.
I.
Dear Readers,
Keep it the tits down, please, you’re being toocloud. Ugh, my head. The combination of Halloweenwith the greatest storm this century means Iwent a little too hard the past few days, so I’m reallynot feeling too swell. Anyway, as you might beable to guess from my post-celebratory migraine,things have been better for me. As you’ll readbelow, having the more-perfect-than-the-perfectstormin town has been a time of great joy amongthe weather-loving community. Operation WTFhas been put on hold as a result of my good humor.You’re welcome for saving you the three calories itwould have taken you to click your mouse, dicks.

This week in last week’s weather, we talk aboutthe glorious, most perfect of storms.
When Chandy rolled in I was invited out ofmy cardboard villa behind the Kong, taken into a nice warm shelter by workers who insistedI would die if left out in the elements, and givenblankets (blankets!!) for the first time in weeks.From the shelter window, I got to watch Chandydecimate the Northeast in her full glory. Theumbrellas finally got what was coming to them,and their bent and broken corpses now linetrash cans from Virginia to New Hampshire.The storm hit our campus with the grace of asilver fox and the strength of an NFL linebacker(before his body is ravaged by extreme workoutsand neurodegenerative disease). Chandy’s rainwas matched only by her winds, and the sight ofher pouring her malice onto the human world ofmachinery has been seared into my retinas, rightnext to the place where molten shrapnel once leftits mark. Overwhelmed by her beauty, I strippedout of my cumulonimbus costume and ran nakedinto the storm, where I made sweet, sweet love tothe violent snow-dusted winds. The doctors saysensation should come back when the swellinggoes down. In my penis.

Dear Readers,
In this one, Hurricane Chandy is lame.

This week in last week’s weather, we talk aboutthe opposite of the aforementioned parallel universe’sthis week’s last week’s weather.
Anti-climatic. Boring. Un-hurricane-ish. Stupid.Just like my father. Never going to amount toanything. A disappointment. Sterile. Ugly. Uglierthan ugly. “Is that it?” she tells me. Yes. That was it.
Hurricanes are like girls, kids: They are characterizedby a low-pressure center and numerousthunderstorms that produce strong winds andheavy rain. The characteristic that separates hurricanesfrom other cyclonic systems and girls isthat at any height in the atmosphere, the centerof a hurricane will be warmer than its surroundings—a phenomenon called “warm core” stormsystems. WARM CORE STORM SYSTEMS.What the hell didn’t happen?
P.S. We miss you, President’s Chair, like a fat kidmisses Orlando “Eddie” Brown’s early musicalcareer on the Disney Channel original televisionsitcom “That’s So Raven” before he got his bigrecord deal break. So come home, will ya, Chair?The weathervane is lonely without your hardbody to gaze at all day. Follow #CrimsonWeatheron twitter for up to last minute weather updates.

Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree first befriended President Barack Obama while he was a student at Harvard Law School in the late eighties. Ogletree spoke with FM last week about the president’s time at Harvard, the impending election, and Harvard’s place in the presidency.
Fifteen Minutes: You taught President Obama when he was student here, correct?
Charles J. Ogletree: I actually met Michelle Robinson Obama first when she arrived at Harvard in 1985 and graduated in 1988. Barack did not come to Harvard until the fall of 1988, so they never met here at Harvard, but I saw him regularly and he would attend a special class that I taught in the late eighties called “Saturday School,” which was a precatory class for students to understand how to brief cases, how to articulate ideas in class, how to prepare to take exams, and how to become good students. And of course he was one of the top students.
FM: What was President Obama like as a student in particular? What do you think characterized his approach to the classroom and to learning?
CJO: He was a dominating feature in the classroom in that he was well prepared, but he also was someone who, every time he answered a question, shared the reward of getting it right with other students in the class. He was someone who would answer a question but within it also recognize—which is very unusual for a student to do—that Alberto and Carol and Jack and Sarah and John and Melissa also had good points they had stated earlier and how they all were part of a comprehensive answer. So he was as much a teaching assistant as he was a student, and I think that is a character that he still holds today. He always wants to make sure that those who are in the room are a part of the conversation and not just the objects of it.
 FM: There have been those who have said that as a student President Obama was not interested in debating, that he was more conciliatory. Do you think that’s a fair characterization?
 CJO: I would expand on it because I think it gives the wrong impression. He was someone who wanted faculty and other students to see that other people in the classroom had good and interesting and provocative ideas. He was not someone who was pushing for airtime just for the sake of time, and he wasn’t making a comment to show how smart he was. He was, in a sense, letting instructors and other students know that there are a lot of building blocks necessary to construct a strong legal argument, and those building blocks were presented one by one by students who would not otherwise be known as have grasped some of the intricacies of the law. And these other students were male and female, black and white, Republican and Democrat, married and single, and I think that’s what made all of this so rich...that he could, in a sense, see the qualities of people.
But he also had another side. He was a very good basketball player and a trash talker. People who worked with him on the Law Review said that he never held political views against anyone who knew how to crack an article or edit an article. He picked the best person, not necessarily the one who agreed with his views. I think that’s why he has such a strong following of people who are of different political persuasions.
FM: What do you make of those who say that the President is not good at working with those who disagree with him?
CJO: I think it’s just not true if you look at the facts. I mean, the people who were on the Law Review had diametrically opposing political views on a host of issues, but they respected his judgment and his fairness. If you think of the economic crisis that we had more than a year ago, he did reach across the aisle and was able to give some important concessions....
In order to achieve his success early in his term with the $787 billion stimulus package and then the Affordable Care Act, those are issues that required reaching across the aisle.
FM: There seems to be less excitement about his candidacy and his campaign this time around compared to 2008. What is your feeling on this election?
CJO: I’m pretty confidant that he will be successful in being re-elected on Nov. 6. That’s because of the numbers of people who are registered to vote on the Democratic side are a lot higher than they were before and the latest figures show an incredibly strong support that he has in women. It’s made an enormous difference.... He still has a very strong base in both the African American and the Latino communities among women and men. So, I think that sense of where things stand, whether or not you take a look at them objectively.
FM: Obviously both President Obama and Governor Mitt Romney spent formative years at Harvard. Do you think there’s any significance in that?
CJO: I’m teaching a reading group for first year students and there’s 12 of them and it’s about Harvard’s graduates run for the White House, and I have randomly assigned six of them to articulate Romney’s positions on a number of issues and six of them to talk about Obama’s issues. I’m not looking for got-you moments or the most-striking position talking in a debate, but I want law students to be able to articulate what they see as the strong points made by their candidate....
So I see it as a teachable moment and if Romney’s elected president, I’ll be teaching a class in 2014 about Romney’s presidency, the same sense about what he did that made people go his way.... I think the fact that they are Harvard graduates says a lot about their ambition toward public service, which is good thing. And I think that they would each bring something strong and different, but significant, to the way we’re run as a country and are viewed by the world as a nation.

Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62 has represented Massachusetts’ Fourth Congressional District for more than 30 years. Last fall, he announced that he would not be running for re-election. Frank spoke with FM last week about Massachusetts’ U.S. Senate race, where Congress is headed, and what’s at stake on Nov. 6.
Fifteen Minutes: You have endorsed Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren in the Massachusetts U.S. Senate race. Why is Warren the best fit to serve the people of Massachusetts? Do you think her campaign is approaching the problems facing the country correctly?
Barney Frank: Yes, absolutely. But to your first question, she’s an extraordinarily creative person with a great ability to work very hard. I worked very closely with her on setting up the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]. She’s a very pragmatic and creative person.
Secondly, she and Scott Brown differ on two major points about what we do with the deficit. She understands that you’re going to have to curtail military spending while you make other cuts. Brown wants to increase military spending, and technically she’s for getting some revenue from the wealthiest people. Brown follows the Romney approach which is you expand military spending, you don’t raise any increased revenue from the wealthy, and then you are forced to make very savage cuts in domestic programs. I also think she’s better on federal issues now.
But, most important—if he wins—you could have a Republican Senate. You get Mitch McConnell. If Brown wins, he may very well be the one that makes the Senate Republican, and you get an extremely right-wing group. You get Mitch McConnell, who said his main job was to harass Obama, make him unsuccessful. You can’t logically want to have Obama be president and have the Republicans control the Senate.
FM: What do you think is the biggest issue at stake on Nov. 6?
BF: It’s whether or not we are going to continue to have the capacity to deal with the quality of life in America. If you take the Republican approach of reducing the deficit only by cutting spending, and you spend more than the military even wants on the military and don’t raise any taxes on the rich, then you bring in a policy where you can’t do very much about the environment, about health care, the cost of education. You just lose your capacity to improve the quality of life by working together here at home.
FM: There’s a large battle looming right after election day as Congress attempts to address sequestration. What do you expect from the so-called lame duck session?
BF: It depends on what happens on election day. If either party is seen as a decisive winner, that could mean that we could get some resolution because the party that is seen as having won in November will be able to have a major say. If it’s seen as kind of a mixed bag, I don’t know what will happen. The problem is there are some very deep commitments on both sides, and I don’t know. I hope that we’ll see some compromise. Again, it will be easier to predict if President Obama is reelected, as I suspect he will be, and the Democrats pick up seats in the House and hold the Senate. If Romney were to win, which I don’t expect, and the Republicans were to hold the House and win the Senate, then I think you’re likely to see they’ll do it their way. Which means, wholly spending cuts solve the deficit.
FM: What do you see as the largest problem that the 113th Congress will face come January when they convene for the first time?
BF: It will be the double problem of how do you promote economic growth for the economy while dealing in the long term with deficit reduction. The Republicans tend to focus only on the deficit reduction. I think that causes harm to the economy. And—oddly—I think if Mitt Romney’s elected, I think he’ll be more interested in doing something with [the economic stimulus] because he won’t want to see a bad economy on his watch. But it’s that dual problem of short-term consumer policies and long-term deficit reduction.
FM: Do you have a prediction for the U.S. Senate race here?
BF: I’m not making predictions.
FM: But you did say before that you think President Obama will win re-election?
BF: Well, I take it back. I am optimistic about Elizabeth and about the president.
FM: This is the first election you have sat out in more than 30 years. Looking back over your time in Congress, what has changed the most since you arrived in Washington in 1981?
BF: The parties have gotten more separate.  The Democrats have become more liberal. The Republicans are more uniformly conservative.... Things have changed. It was the takeover of the Republican Party by the Tea Party that was the most radical shift. This is the most extreme ideological faction controlling a major political party in American history. That’s the biggest change and it happened in just the last couple years.

Last Monday night, students across campus watched Bob Schieffer question Barack Obama and Mitt Romney on their respective foreign policy agendas. The next night, a much smaller number of students watched a different debate: The Third Party Presidential Debate organized by the Free and Equal Elections Foundation, which featured questions on marijuana legalization, campaign finance reform, and other issues largely absent in the presidential debates this season. The men and women who debated represented neither the Democratic or Republican parties, but instead the Constitu- tion, Justice, Green, and Libertarian Parties. While students who align with these third-party candidates are a significant minority at Harvard, they represent the political alignment outside the two-party system and experience varying levels of acceptance for their views.
THE SYMBOLIC VOTE
For students like Carolyn E. Killea ’15, the choice to vote third-party is a matter of sending a message. Killea, a member of the Harvard Libertar- ian Forum, knows that libertarian candidate Gary Johnson won’t win the presi- dency. But, even though she is reg- istered to vote in Florida, a swing state, Killea feels strongly enough about her libertar- ian ideology to vote for John- son and give up having a stake in the election of the next president.
“There are people who do care enough about—in this case—freedom [so as] to give up having a say in the discussion between two really similar political parties,” Killea says. She even has what she calls “cute little taglines” that she often says to help people understand why she votes libertarian—phrases along the lines of “A wasted vote is a vote for someone you don’t believe in.”
But even for students who do not definitively prefer a third-party candidate’s ideology, voting for a third party can be a way to express disgust with a political system that forces candidates to widen their appeal in order to garner more votes. Elena F. Hoffenberg ’16 is considering voting for Jill Stein because Stein is “able to take stands that the Democrats cannot actually take because they have to appeal to a wider base." While Hoffenberg is registered to vote in Massachusetts and believes that her vote for either candidate will probably not sway from Obama's projected win in the state, she has decided to weigh her choice between Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Barack Obama carefully.
Both Killea and Corinne H. Curcie '15, the president of the Harvard Libertarian Forum, acknowledge that some students at Harvard may actually align with a third-party ideology, but choose to vote Democrat or Republican for fear that a vote for a third-party candidate will go to waste. “Students may agree with us but don’t want to always be disappointed by political results,” says Curcie.
Killea feels that the average third-party supporter at Har- vard is likely to be more politically engaged than the average Democrat or Republican on campus. “Very few people are born into libertarianism,” Killea says of the contrast with Democratic and Republican views that are often inherited from parents. As of Saturday, an internal club survey shows that 45 percent of members in the Libertarian Forum are concentrating in government at the College or are studying at HLS or HKS.
But even in a university that is widely recognized as predominantly liberal, some non-Democrat, leftist students feel a lack of institutional space for their ideol- ogy. While the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has a Harvard Socialist Club, Hoffenberg says many of her fellow left-leaning friends feel that the club does not represent socialists on campus well, and has found more leftist, third-party supporters in activism groups like the Student Labor Action Movement. Having such a palpable Democratic presence on campus, Killea suggests, may be drowning out the voices of third-party-supportive, leftist undergraduates at Harvard.

A MISUNDERSTOOD MINORITY
Third party student supporters have not always found their voting preferences welcomed by their peers. As libertarians, Curcie and Killea have experienced both explicit animosity and “forced politeness” from fellow students who don't understand what it means to be a liberatrian. Some simply aren't informed about the tenets of libertarianism, while others view it as a rogue wing of either the Democratic or Republican party, and see a vote for a libertarian candidate as stealing a vote from the major candidates in a close election.
Nevertheless, the Harvard Libertarian Forum currently boasts over 300 members, making it Harvard's largest third-party group. Curcie also acknowledges that many at the colelge may be "closeted libertarians," or members of the student body and faculty who unkowingly identify with libertarianism, or choose to keep their belief private.
Economics professor Jeffrey A. Miron identifies as an "economic libertarian" and has encountered people who misunderstand his views and stereotype libertarians as gun-toting, diehard Constitutionalists. Miron, who will co-teach Ethical Reasoning 34: “Liberty” in the coming spring, also believes that people are often more libertarian than they realize or acknowledge. Many people are “more fiscally moderate than Democrats and more socially moderate than Republicans,” he says.
Libertarians such as John E. Davison ’14 believe that much would have to change to earn third- party candidates more vis- ibility. For Davison, poll- ing methods represent a troubling practice. “Polls such as Gal- lup are set up in such a way where you are asked if you are voting for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney and very rarely include a third choice,” he says. “If you ask anyone who knows statistics, you already know that’s a weighted question.”
Killea supports holding open primaries, which would not force people to pick a side before they see the candidates. Hoffenberg suggests changing state laws to make it easier for candidates to appear on the ballot and allowing candidates outside the two main parties to partake in debates.
“The two main parties would have to give up a lot of their hold on the political process in an incredibly selfless and surprising move,” says Killea. “I don’t think that’s going to happen.” However unlikely this funda- mental change is, Hoffenberg sees an increase in third- party visibility as a necessary step in the path toward changing the political conversation in this country for the better.
Hoffenberg is still deciding what her vote means to her. If she votes for Jill Stein, she will be making a statement about a broken political system; if she votes for Jill Stein, she will be making a statement about a broken political system; if she votes for President Obama, she will have a greater stake in the election of the next president. "In a true democracy, I feel like you would just vote for whoever best represents your ideas regardless of their chances of winning," Hoffenberg says. "But that's not always the way it works."

“I think we’re definitely going the wrong way,” Daniel R. Ki ’15 says, examining the MapQuest printout of Rochester, N.H. He pulls out his phone to double check the location, shifting the device so his partner can see their blue dot moving in the opposite direction of Lincoln Ave. “The real question is how people were able to canvass before iPhones,” he jokes as the pair turns around, doubling back down Main St. towards their designated canvassing area.
The first house on the list is 9 Lincoln, a voter named Deborah. Ki knocks on the door to no response.
“Deborah does not seem to be here,” Ki says. Two figures are visible in the second-floor window, pulling their barking dog away from the open screen. He turns and heads down the street.
The woman at the last house on the block must be in her early seventies. She wraps her head around the door before emerging, as Ki asks enthusiastically if she plans to vote.
“I have every intention of it,” she nods, slowly.
“Would you mind telling me if you plan on supporting the President this year?” Ki asks politely.
“I wouldn’t count on anything,” the woman says, shaking her head. “I’m still weighing it.”
“Well, I’ll tell you why I’m supporting the President,” Ki begins, sticking to the script he practiced earlier. He mentions education, healthcare, Obama’s commitment to expanding Pell Grants—a 30-second speech. “That’s why I’m supporting the President,” he finishes, ending where he started.
“You can afford to. You’re young. I’m old. How much longer am I gonna be around?” she says, laughing a little. “The best I can tell you is that I’m gonna vote,” she finally offers.
“Thanks for your time. Have a nice day,” Ki says, still smiling as he steps off of the porch. He makes a mark on his canvassing packet and consults the map again. Twenty-seven more houses to go.

“The last couple of weeks have been a whirlwind, I can’t even remember what I’ve done—it’s been great!” says Aditi Ghai ’14, laughing breathlessly. The sound of beeping cars and surrounding traffic mingle with her voice as she navigates the busy road, driving back from an impromptu work conference. Though based in Boston at the Romney headquarters, she has also been anywhere and everywhere else, recently returning from out of state handing a campaign situation.
The last few weeks—indeed, months—have been a blur for Ghai, who has taken the semester off to work as a full-time Romney campaign staffer. Even her summer work as a Romney intern has merged into her current job. “I don’t even remember, I couldn’t even tell you when summer technically ended,” she says.
For students off campus, working full-time in campaigns is an all-encompassing experience that does not leave much time for reflection. It is such a large process with so many moving parts, that it is hard to find the place of the individual cog within the bigger machinery.
“How can we in this campaign, as a part of a larger machine, make a difference?,” asks Jason Hirschhorn ’14, as he nears the end of his Virginia-based campaign work for former Governor and senatorial candidate Tim Kaine. “Had we not been here, there probably would have been someone else in our place, so what can we do to make a difference? To be creative? More efficient?” Jason pursues the question further—an issue as much personal as it is philosophical.
Given the immersive nature of Ghai’s work at Romney headquarters, there is a lack of clear demarcation between life as a part of and apart from the campaign. “It’s so hard to distinguish when the nature of the work is so cooperative,” says Ghai. “I’m doing whatever and anything I can to help and I know that everyone else is too.” Perhaps that, then, is the point. “Everybody in the building—from staff, interns, operations, communications—is indispensable. You definitely see the impact on the campaign world. Everybody is contributing in some way. Everyone is willing to help out.”
To be at the center of a movement, to work in constant collaboration with a community of people who believe in one goal, with one election in mind—it is this larger purpose of the campaign that drives these students.
CATCHING ONE'S STRIDE
“I think falling onto it is actually a good way to describe it. It was kind of on a whim,” Ki recalls of the beginning of his involvement with the campaign to re-elect Obama. During the final week of winter term last year, Ki was on campus taking a writing class that only met for a few hours daily. “I wanted to try something that would fill up the other hours of the day,” he remembers.
Ki was interested in politics throughout high school, but he had never been involved in a campaign. To fill the empty hours he spent on campus that January, Ki got in touch with the Massachusetts state director of Obama for America (OFA), the field organizing initiative of Obama’s presidential campaign, to further explore volunteer opportunities.
He began working in the local OFA office, organizing phone banks and canvasses to rally Democrats for the primary elections early this year. On January 10, the day of the New Hampshire primary, Ki traveled up to Manchester to knock on the doors of registered Democrats. “New Hampshire on primary day this time didn’t count,” he admits.
Even though Obama had no opponents on the ballot that day, it was a pivotal moment for Ki. “I ended up meeting Ron Paul as I was canvassing and got a picture with him,” he says of his first day on the trail. “That was kind of the start to my experience on the campaign. I was absolutely hooked.”
After the school year started up again, Ki became an organizing fellow for the campaign, and over the summer he was in charge of training college students to lead their campus teams in the fall. Since the start of the fall semester, Ki has been the Massachusetts campus director, responsible for organizing Democrats into canvassing and phone-banking groups at Harvard and eight other universities across the state.
When Luciana E. Milano ’14 returned to campus this semester, she was riding high off the energy and momentum of the Republican National Convention. Her summer work in Washington, D.C. had also provided her with encounters with high-profile Republicans. “Having the opportunity to meet Paul Ryan and meet so many people I really liked, for me that was really exciting,” says Milano, with a lingering sense of awe. Recounting the Convention, she continues, “It was incredible to be on the floor, to be in the front row—up close, listening to them, getting one-on-one time with important pundits.”
These encounters gave her “a whole new perspective on the Romney campaign,” and provided a stronger impetus for taking a greater leadership role within the Harvard Republican Club as Vice President of Campaigns. “Coming back to campus,” says Milano, “I was just really excited to get other people invested in the campaign—to inspire people to be involved.”
SPLIT DECISIONS
“I wanted to see this campus during a presidential election year, since back in 2008 I heard it was quite the place,” says Simon M. Thompson ’14, Campaigns Director of the Harvard College Democrats. Though Thompson seriously considered taking the semester off to work on a mayoral campaign in Maine during his sophomore year, “This fall it was a pretty easy decision to come back here,” he says. An important part of this choice was the groundwork that Thompson had laid already for the College Democrats involvement in the campaigns of President Obama and Elizabeth Warren. “I was already coordinating stuff for the fall with OFA and the Warren campaign,” he says.
Ki also made the choice to stay at Harvard this fall, despite suggestions from the the state director of OFA that he take the semester off to work for the campaign. “I decided that I’d rather stay on campus, mainly because I wanted to graduate with my class,” he says.
Faced with the same dilemma as Ki, Ghai chose the opposite path. “I do want to graduate with my friends, I do want to be sitting on Lowell courtyard in 2014 with my blockmates, but I do know I will be graduating behind,” says Ghai, whose graduation date may depend on the outcome of the election. Ghai is uncertain about her continued role in politics, but it is a possibility for her to continue working for Romney if he moves into the White House.
Ghai still maintains close contact with her Harvard friends, describing moments with them as her anchor. “It keeps me grounded. It breaks up my day, rather than it being work, sleep, work, sleep.” It is important for her to see them even if, as it often is, only for 15-minute coffee breaks.
Being in Boston made the decision to take time off easier, but it was still a difficult choice. “Harvard is a community when you’re there, a community really structured around being there for four years on campus,” says Ghai. While Romney headquarters have become a second home for Ghai, she is aware of her other community, one that she has left behind across the bridge.
It is a sentiment shared by fellow off-campus campaigner Hirschhorn. Speaking on the phone from Richmond, Va. where he is currently based, Hirschhorn is grateful to be living and working with Michael A. Walker ’15, a friend he originally met through a community service program at Harvard.
“Before Michael got here, I was on my own, and it was daunting, building new friends and new social circles.... It’s nice to have one really close friend here,” says Hirschhorn, who views leaving behind the tight-knit community at Harvard as one of the more difficult aspects of his experience. “I miss Harvard, my friends and close relationships,” he says.
Still, “when all is said and done,” Hirschorn says, “I don’t think there was anything I gave up too much. My friendships will still be there; everything will still be there.”
BACK TO THE OLD GRIND
Milano speaks on the phone with the kind of high-tempo intensity that matches the frenetic energy of her day. She is on a lunch break, having spent all morning knocking on doors in northern Massachusetts with Republicans from the College and the Harvard Kennedy School. This fall she has led trips for the Scott Brown campaign, and on election weekend she and her group will make one last big canvassing push in New Hampshire.
“When you’re not afraid to stand up for what you believe in, you quickly meet people who are understanding...or they disagree with you,” says Milano. She has found her campaigning experiences both challenging and exciting. However, she is happy simply to share her experiences: speaking to voters in Italian and Spanish, explaining her Texan background, the little conversations she struck up on the Boston T about her Romney iPhone case.
Despite its demands on her time, Milano looks forward to her weekly campaign work. “Some people see it as work, but I see it as a break,” she says. “I do it because I love it. It’s so exciting, I want to do it,” concludes Milano as she rushes off to grab a bite of food, refueling to go door-to-door once more.
Similarly, Ki views his weekly meetings and trips to Boston and New Hampshire as extracurricular activities. “Of course, it takes up a lot of time, “ he says. But, he recognizes, “Just like any Harvard student, you’ve got to make choices.”
Those who have spent considerable time on a campaign develop a particular shared lexicon that is immediately apparent to outsiders. “There are things in my vocabulary that are probably changed because of the campaign,” says Ki, who spends 15 hours a week making phone calls, knocking on doors, and sitting in meetings with other campaign staffers and volunteers. “One of my friends noticed that I refer to the President as ‘The President’ instead of just Obama now,” he notes.
With 30 hours a week split between fieldwork and organizing members of the College Democrats, Thompson’s role is nearly a full-time job, and his vocabulary, too, has come to reflect this. “Whenever I am knocking on doors or calling people or anything like that, I always use ‘folks,’” he says, laughing. When calling voters in other states, “folks” is frequently thrown around by those working for the Obama campaign. “It plays really well up in Maine and then, when you’re calling in Virginia, it plays perfectly,” Thompson says.
For Thompson, the canvassing trips up to New Hampshire have been welcome forays into the real world. “You knock on one door and it’s a Ron Paul supporter, and the next door it’s [a] Romney [supporter], and the next door is an Obama supporter,” Thompson says. “It’s nice to get out of the Harvard bubble where everyone’s basically some shade of liberal.”
In small and unconscious ways, campaign work colors the world of these students’ lives. It is something that they are, at least for the duration of the campaign, living, breathing, and speaking. It is easy to be swept up in the pace, in the workload, in the tight communities that are formed.
“You hit the ground running and you don’t even realize how wholly surrounded you are by this whole atmosphere,” Ghai says. “Having dinner with my friends, having a normal conversation, somehow, give it five minutes and the conversation will turn to politics and my friends will ask me ‘Hey, can you talk about anything else ever?’”
THE HEADQUARTERS
While Ghai’s position prevents her from disclosing the specifics of her job, she describes her work as extremely time-sensitive and fast-paced—things can crop up at any moment, requiring immediate attention: “This is what you need to do. Do it right now, you have 20 minutes, go!” Ghai says in a light-hearted imitation of a task assignment.
The sensitivity of her work and its importance, however, is not lost on Ghai. “If I want to go get a glass of water and take two minutes to walk to the kitchen...people are very aware of the fact that what I’m doing just took two minutes longer,” says Ghai. “It’s not a problem in and of itself, but that’s the nature of the work I’m doing.”
“I feel like I know almost everybody,” says Ghai, referring to the 400-odd employees at the Romney headquarters. Ghai warmly shares one of her office anecdotes: “One of the girls in my office jokes that she’s like my little sister.”
Along with her co-workers, Ghai pulls long hours, sometimes staying in the office until 2:00 or 4:00 a.m. These hours are not enforced. Rather, she says, “I love spending time in the office, and sometimes my boss needs to tell me ‘Go home! You’re done!’” It is at moments like these, says Ghai sheepishly, that “I realize that I do need to eat dinner and so on.”
So close to the election, the sense of urgency has escalated. Work and life have converged to a concentrated point inside the Romney headquarters. In these last few weeks of the campaign, working lunches—with staffers crammed into a small room, tapping away at individual screens, leaving only to take calls—are the norm.
It is not unusual, Ghai recalls, for even the most simple daily tasks to be done together. When one staffer picks up dry cleaning, an invitation is often offered to pick up others’—no one knows when they’ll be leaving the office, or if the the dry cleaners will be open at that time.
“There is a lot of cooperation,” Ghai says. “Everybody looks out for each other. It does extend beyond work—it is important that there is loyalty to the candidate, but also loyalty to each other.”
A BALANCING ACT
Sarah T. Pierson ’14 works as an intern at the Romney campaign headquarters four days a week. She commutes 30-45 minutes to the North End in Boston, where the Romney offices are located, working anywhere from six to upwards of 10 hours a day. A History concentrator, her 11 hours of class per week are crammed into Tuesday and Thursday. Sleep is a distant dream, her blockmates have not seen her in days, and in the lead-up to Nov. 6, it’s all only going to get crazier.
“From the start I knew it would be difficult,” says Pierson, regarding her decision to intern for the Romney campaign while remaining a full-time student. Pierson has also put her varsity sailing career on hold. It was a painful decision—some of her best friends are on the sailing team, and they had just come out of a championship season. But, between her campaign job and catching up on missed schoolwork, there is not much room for anything else.
As an intern, Pierson has moved among various teams within the campaign, but she has never felt lost within the large office and its ever-moving, ever-expanding cycle of interns, staffers, and volunteers. “Within 10 minutes of walking in the door there was automatic integration,” she says.
Campaign headquarters have given Pierson a strong support system and a place where she has built deep relationships. “We’re all friends, we text each other all the time,” she says of her fellow interns.  Being part of the campaign team is, for Pierson, “exhilarating and real, believing in something and working for a cause you believe in.”
It has not been so easy, however, transitioning back to campus life. “I have to constantly switch modes,” Pierson says. “It requires focus and the ability to compartmentalize.” It has at times been frustrating to make the transition. Pierson has less time to see her friends and roommates, to hang out like any other college student. “People sometimes don’t understand…” says Pierson, hesitating, “the commitment, what it involves,” she says.
REFLECTIONS
The process of campaigning is inherently a collective one. A team of individuals come together to form a moving, shifting organic whole. For these students, to have been part of such teams is to have been swept into something bigger than themselves—the candidate, the campaign, the ideal. However—even though the process is one of losing themselves in the work—ultimately the journey is one of deeper self-discovery.
For Ki, working to convince others to support President Obama has allowed him to gain perspective on his own understanding of politics. “Even when I first started working on the campaign, just like any other college student who thinks hard about their political views, I questioned still,” he admits. Talking through the issues with undecided voters on the phone or at their doorsteps has helped solidify his stances. “Now that I’ve seen both sides, I’ve seen all those facts and figures—it makes me actually more firm in my beliefs.”
For the students who are taking time away from Harvard, leaving the bubble has given them an opportunity to broaden their perspectives—to learn about both the outside world and themselves.
“I think I’ve definitely gotten to know myself better and understand what matters to me a lot more,” says Ghai, reflecting on her campaign experience. “I have learned, in a more defined and chiseled-out fashion, what I care about and why I care about what I care about,” she concludes. For Hirschhorn, “What I’ve learned from working with other people...the experiences from outside Harvard—to work and then return—will make my time at Harvard more meaningful.”
As students immersed in campaigns have discovered on the ground, this kind of education has a steep learning curve. Thompson admits that canvassing and phone-banking can be frustrating when his efforts result in minimal contact with voters. “Once, when I was up in New Hampshire, I spent two to two and a half hours knocking on doors and I talked to one person,” he says. “And that person refused to talk to me about the election.”
Interactions like these can be discouraging for Thompson, but he still believes in the significance of his contributions to a larger movement. “I definitely have those moments where it’s like, ‘Okay, I could be spending my time more valuably right now than I am,’” he says. But Thompson always chooses to dial the next number, to knock on the next door, to keep working until the polls close. Ultimately, he continues, “You kind of just have to look back at the broader picture.”
Sections
Harvard Business School professor Clayton M. Christensen met Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney at Brigham Young University more than 40 years ago. Both are Mormons and Harvard Business School alumni. FM sat down with Christensen last week to talk about his friend, the Business School, and the election.
FM: Governor Romney was part of the joint J.D./M.B.A. program when he was at Harvard. What element of this education do you think was the most significant  for Romney?
CMC: The case method [at HBS], because it teaches you that asking the right questions is more important than getting the right answers—that's critical in solving big problems. Number two, learning how to teach and learn one from another is another thing that will be critical for him to do. And three, the confidence that he can think his way through a problem. I think those three he takes that way from HBS to the presidency.
FM: Do those skills apply in the same way to the presidency as they might to a career in business?
CMC: Absolutely. For example, when Mitt Romney left Bain to create Bain Capital, Bain the consulting firm almost fell apart. What had happened is that Mr. Bain himself and six of the partners decided they were going to sell out and the people who were responsible for putting that deal together put together a deal that essentially took all of the money from the remaining partners and gave it to the founding members, and the company was just falling apart. The only person that they could think of on either side of this debate, who they all trusted could reach a consensus, was Mitt Romney. He had to leave Bain Capital, come back to Bain, and essentially tell the partners who had founded the company that we're going to only pay you about a sixth of the deal that you originally orchestrated, because what you agreed upon makes no sense. And he had to get the people who were so mad at them to agree to stay on the team. Nobody in the world could have pulled that together but Mitt Romney. That was as difficult a problem as the leaders of the Palestinians and the Israelis. In a contrast, Obama has never had any experience pulling people together to agree on something that they disagree on He has no experience at that.
FM: Romney’s budget proposal has been the subject of much scrutiny by President Obama and the left. Are those criticisms fair?
CMC: I can tell you that neither of their proposals has any hope of ever having any impact on America. They truly will not have any impact because they truly don’t understand the real problem. The problem is that on both sides they employ economists and lawyers. And the economists and lawyers have no experience ever doing anything.
FM: If he were to win on Nov. 6 and become president of the United States, what part of the job do you think would be most difficult for Romney?
CMC: Pulling the Democrats and Republicans in Congress to think about things on the same page. I think he came out of here with a lot of confidence, maybe even too much confidence that he can solve difficult problems. So, rather than that he personally doesn't have it, I'd frame it more as there are some big problems.
FM: You've written a lot about Mormonism in the context of Romney's candidacy. How do you think Mormonism informs his character and his leadership style?
CMC: You don't really need to know much about the person unless you first try to understand the church...in the Mormon Church a ward is a congregation. [The Cambridge ward of the Mormon Church] had one of every conceivable type of human being in a typical Mormon ward, and so in every ward you will have three or for people who are wrestling with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. We don’t have any professionals; we don't pay anybody to take care of people. We have to do it ourselves.
I remember when Mitt was our bishop, we had a family in our ward where the mother had schizophrenia and really, really suffered. They had three children under the age of eight. The father had multiple sclerosis and couldn’t get out of his wheel chair. Neither the father nor the mother had any relatives. And the congregation had to take care of this family. We literally had to take care of this family. And Mitt, responsible for it—he couldn’t have decided who to ask to do what to take care of all of these people unless he had been there in their home, wrestling as they're wrestling through these problems. Once he understood the problems, then he could leave and say, “Christensen, I want you to do this for them and I need you to do this for them and we need to give a check for these people to do that thing, and you need to get them a job.”
If you want to understand what it is to be a bishop in a Mormon church, you’ve got to go inside the ward and experience that. I’ve been a bishop, and I have my own job, and on top of that, to be a bishop was 30 hours extra every week helping all of these people. And if anybody thinks that Mitt Romney doesn’t understand how humanity lives, they have no idea how humanity lives.
FM: Why do you think that doesn't come up often on the campaign trail?
CMC: He's a very private guy. And everybody in the ward can give you extraordinary experiences about Mitt personally coming to their home to help them in their time of need, but he just doesn’t talk about it.
FM: Election day is now a little less than two weeks away. What's your personal feelings about this election?
CMC: I'm just very frustrated with the whole process. There's a piece of my research about the job to be done. Essentially, what we're trying to say to the world is that if you decide that markets are segmented by demographics, the only way you will get the business of customers inside every demographic is if you make a product that does everything for everybody….
So when the pollsters tell Romney, “You're about 20 points behind in women, age 35 to 50, what are you going to do?,” it's such a stupid way to categorize the world. The only way that you can get that group of people is if you offer everybody everything. The way Obama responds to that is to offer even more to everybody. It's the craziest institution I can conceive of, but it causes the election to become filled with lies, recrimination, and falsehood. It's tough to see Mitt get pulled through all of that because he's smarter than that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical Workers demonstrated in the yard and outside of the science center early Wednesday afternoon at a Halloween-themed event that was designed to inform students and other community members about the union’s ongoing contract negotiations with the University, according to participants.
Around 30 workers, union officers, and supporters dressed in Halloween costumes stood in two groups, one along the pathway through the construction site outside the science center, and one inside the yard near its entrance next to Dudley House. Each group held a series of signs, the first of which read, “Harvard is investing in great things!” The next few listed some of the University’s ongoing projects, such as Harvard and MIT’s online education venture EdX and development in Allston. The last two signs read, “But isn’t Harvard forgetting something,” and, “Invest in staff—we make Harvard great!”
“The community needs to know where the University is investing its money,” said Rachel R. School, a union organizer who was at the event. “We can’t grow the University in buildings and structures without staffing them appropriately.”
The union and University, who have been negotiating since early April, were scheduled to ratify a new contract on July 1, but negotiators have still not reached an agreement. Particularly contentious issues include the size of a salary increase and health care, and the conversation surrounding them, at least in public, has centered around a disagreement over the financial health of the University and thus its capacity to pay for workers salaries and benefits.
Harvard Labor Relations Director Bill Murphy spoke with the Harvard Gazette, a University publication, in mid-October about the negotiations and said that the salary increases that the University was offering were fair.
“It’s important to note that we’re not pointing to the current economic climate and making an argument to reduce or suppress wages,” Murphy told the Gazette. “What we’re offering is competitive, no matter how you look at it.”
Margaret Moore de Chicojay, a program manager at the Graduate School of Design who was at the event, said that the event focused on the the University “exuberant and expansive spending, which we’re highlighting because it’s in direct contract to what the University is telling us [in negotiations].”
She added that Wednesday’s event might help people unfamiliar with the union’s situation become more knowledgeable.
“Folks tend to not think about these sorts of issues,” Moore de Chicojay said. “And obviously the goofy costumes are because it’s Halloween.”
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that he thought the event was a success.
“We had a lot of fun,” Jaeger said. “It’s been a grueling negotiations, so it’s nice to have a chance to do something that’s a little bit more relaxed...It was a good, lighthearted way to connect with students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Six months after Harvard Law School’s Student Government president Matthew P. Gelfand graduated and one month after the release of his rewritten student government constitution, the Law School has finally voted for new leaders of its renamed Student Representative Board.
Lisa M. Lana and Andrew M. London, both second-year students, ran unopposed for president and vice president of the SRB, respectively.
Lana, who has never been involved with student government before, said she is looking forward to advocating for students and learning more about how the administration works.
“I thought of this as an exciting point in the progression of the organization to get involved and be part of recreating it as a really positive organization that has a good, solid presence on campus,” she said.
All other SRB representatives have been elected except for four positions that remain vacant: a first-year representative for one of seven 1L sections; an SJD representative; one second-year representative; and one third-year representative. Lana said she is conducting outreach to fill these spots and is particularly concerned about the 1L section and SJD vacancies, as those are currently bodies of students that are “completely unrepresented at this point.”
She posited that the timing of elections this year are why fewer students applied for positions, as many students are already involved with a lot of activities on campus.
First-year SRB representative David Dorfman, who also serves as the co-chair of his section, said that the vacancies reflect the changes going on with the SRB.
“We’re building anew from the ground up,” he said. “People are uncertain of the role SRB is going to play, and I think once people realize what a positive force we’ll be, people will become more involved with the organization.”
Nevertheless, both Dorfman and Lana said they have a lot of confidence in the new SRB board. Lana said they have already started to address issues that were mentioned during the campaign, including the reinstitution of Pub Nights starting with a kick off event in a few weeks and eliminating the gap in service hours with the Hark Box and the Pub Servery.
One issue that remains after Gelfand’s tenure is that his new constitution does not specify how the SRB will allocate funding to student organizations. Lana said that the Rep Board has scheduled a meeting with their Director of Student Organizations and the Dean of Students to discuss what that process will be. She added that the budget for student organizations each year is determined the previous year, so organizations currently operating on campus have not been affected.
“We do have a little bit of a buffer,” she said.
“We’re also getting started later in the year than the organization has in the past, which I think is difficult in some ways but can also be an advantage,” Lana added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Merlin waited out the wind and rains of Hurricane Sandy in an alleyway in Harvard Square, hunkering with other homeless people in an attempt to stay dry.
“There was no one out. No places were open, so there was no access to food,” he said. “Those two days were rough.... Some people had stocked up on food, but the worst part was not having any blankets to stay warm.”
For Merlin, who only gave his first name, and many others who had to brave the elements, the storm on Monday and Tuesday meant an added challenge on top of the daily struggles of homelessness.
Patrick, a 26-year-old who also declined to give his last name, stayed with a couple who regularly opens up their home to those in need during storms. Initially unprepared for the hurricane, he said he and his dog were lucky to find a place to stay.
“I didn’t know about it until a couple of days before, and thought, ‘Oh, God, I need to get inside,’” he said. The couple with whom he stayed were vegetarians who did not have alcohol or drugs in the house, and he said it was “good to be sober for a couple of days.”
Another man, who gave his name as ‘Chaser,’ said that he and two other squatters spent two hours walking to Oak Square in Boston, where they took refuge in a friend’s single-bedroom apartment. They ate deep-fried chicken and seasoned rice, purchased with a friend’s food stamps.
Now that the skies have cleared up, he is back sleeping on the streets. “I don’t like to be a hindrance to people or ask for help unless it’s a real emergency,” he said, tightening the sweater wrapped around his dog.
Merlin, Patrick, and Chaser all said they did not consider staying in a homeless shelter. While the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter does not open for the winter until Nov. 15, the Salvation Army shelter in Central Square housed about 10 people over its normal quota of 49.
Patrick said he avoids shelters because “most of the time they’re filled up all the way.”
For Chaser, a 29-year-old ex-drug addict, it “infuriates” him to stay in shelters with people who are not sober. He has weathered a few New England winters, typically hopping on freight trains during the colder months. This year, he said, he has no choice but to stay in the area. He was arrested for squatting in an abandoned theater, consequently losing his job of 4.5 years at a Cambridge restaurant and club. While he awaits his next court date, he must stay in Massachusetts. Furthermore, he said, he wants to “be a dad” for his 9-year-old son, who lives with his grandmother in Southern Massachusetts.
In the aftermath of the storm, Merlin sat on Mass. Ave. with a cardboard sign reading “Seeking Human Kindness.” Through dirt-caked eyelashes and a toothless grin, he reflected on the hurricane, “On behalf of everyone out here, I just give thanks for people coming out and helping us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers from Harvard, New York University, and Dow Chemical have manufactured microparticles with the ability to assemble themselves into complex three-dimensional structures, a technology that could lead to developments in optical materials and ceramics.
The project focused on the configuration of colloids—microscopic particles dispersed throughout a medium. Researchers had previously used colloids to build basic structures but had not yet ventured into the construction of elaborate three-dimensional systems.
The creation of more complicated designs originally proved difficult. Colloidal particles lack bond directionality, which is vital to particle self-assembly and necessary for maintaining the integrity of advanced structures. The project assembled particles into stable structures, similar to the formation of molecules from their atomic roots.
“What this method aimed to do was to use nature’s properties for atoms and apply them to the colloidal world,” study co-author Marcus Weck, an NYU chemistry professor, said in a press release.
The crystallized colloidal structures that the researchers made are roughly 10,000 times larger than atomic crystals and are predicted to have advanced optical capabilities.
The project began roughly a decade ago at University of California, Santa Barbara, where Vinothan N. Manoharan, now a Harvard professor, was a Ph.D. student. According to Manoharan, the original intent of the study, and the focus of his work while at UCSB, was to make colloidal particles with the directional bonding capabilities that they ordinarily lack. Such a development would allow the researchers to later make more elaborate crystallized structures.
“The motivation for doing that was to make interesting kinds of crystal structures,” he said.
After the creation of the colloidal particles, the project moved to NYU, where David Pine, who headed the efforts at UCSB, partnered with NYU faculty and graduate students to ultimately create the complex interactions between the colloidal particles. “They did the hard part of making the interactions between the particles,” Manoharan described that phase of the research.
The development of such colloids enabled the creation of chemical “patches” formed through directional bonds. These patches can be assembled into stable three-dimensional “lattices” by way of DNA bonding.
“What this means is we can make particles that attach only at the patches, and then we can program them so only specific kinds of particles attach at those patches,” Pine said in the press release. “This gives us tremendous flexibility to design three-dimensional structures.”
Most of the laboratory work was carried out at NYU’s Materials Research Science and Engineering Center and supported by the National Science Foundation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, one of the nation’s leading providers of above-the-shoulders treatment and research, cut the ribbon Wednesday morning on a new 90,000-foot facility on Huntington Avenue in the Longwood/Mission Hill area of Boston.
“This building is good news for patients, and it’s bad news for blindness, ear problems, and eye problems,” said Mass. Eye and Ear Board Chairman Wyc Grousbeck, the co-owner of the Boston Celtics.
The new facility, which will begin accepting patients this month, is to be staffed by leading physicians, most of whom will move from other Mass. Eye and Ear locations, according to Joan W. Miller, chair of the Infirmary’s ophthalmology department and an ophthalmology professor at Harvard Medical School. The Longwood branch will also partner with local hospitals, including the Brigham and Women’s Physicians Group and the Joslin Diabetes Center.
At first, the new facility will focus on ophthalmology. To that end, its walls are painted in high contrast colors and the interior is decorated with furniture designed to help visually impaired patients find their way. Natural light flows in through expansive windows.
The Huntington Avenue facility was praised by community representatives at the event.
“Mass. Eye and Ear really did its homework,” said Patricia Flaherty, the senior project manager at Mission Hill Neighborhood Housing Services. “Here in Longwood, we have a growing senior population. The new facility gives us access to ophthalmology services, to ear and eye care, and even a place to buy eyeglasses, which we didn’t have before.”
Flaherty credited Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino not only with making the project a reality, but also with ensuring that it was a positive addition to the area.
“This was actually Plan B,” Flaherty said. “A seven-story biological lab was originally planned, but that didn’t fit at all into our community.... The Mayor really heard us. He heard us say ‘no.’ And he helped us go in another direction.”
That new direction was Mass. Eye and Ear, and the organization has made extensive efforts to integrate itself into the community.
“We’ve worked with them to set up two job fairs,” Flaherty said. “And so far they’ve hired half a dozen workers from the neighborhood. As we continue to work together, I really hope that number grows.”
Menino had planned to attend the opening but was under the weather. In a press release, he said, “Massachusetts Eye and Ear has a long history of excellent clinical care and innovative research. Today I applaud this great institution for working closely with the Mission Hill neighborhood to bring critical specialized services to the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, and on the heels of the men’s basketball team’s most successful season in 66 years, Harvard unveiled plans for Allston that included, among other initiatives, the construction of a state-of-the-art basketball arena. While some community members approve of the University’s overall vision, others fear that the new venue  might alter the neighborhood’s dynamics.
Residents worried that the arena, slated for completion sometime between 2017 and 2022, and the noise that comes hand-in-hand collegiate sporting events might disrupt the predominantly residential neighborhood surrounding the proposed site.
“[Games] tend to be intense activity for a very short period of time and often there is social behavior associated with them that creates conflict with the community,” said Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton.
Harvard’s proposal strikes a sore nerve, Houghton said, since Allston residents have had issues with rowdiness at other university’s recently-built complexes, such as the Boston University’s Agannis stadium.
Houghton also said that given large number of properties Harvard owns in Allston, the University could find a different location for the new arena.
Ray V. Mellone, chair of the Task Force and an Allston resident, said he does not foresee the stadium causing  major problems, but did stress the importance of planning for issues like traffic and parking. Such forethought, he said, is essential to ensuring that athletic events do not interrupt or burden residents.
Task Force member Harry E. Mattison agreed with Mellone, and said he was skeptical that the University would ensure that the structure is well integrated.
Harvard associate vice president for public affair and communications Kevin Casey wrote in an email statement that Harvard will ensure that the University’s development benefits both the University and Allston residents.
“We will continue to work closely with the Allston community as the plan develops, and as we move forward with each project,” he wrote.
This new plan reworks previous plans put on ice during the financial crisis. In 2007, the University revealed a 30 to 50-year plan which envisioned a $1 billion dollar science complex in Allston—a project which would simultaneously transform the area into a bustling academic and commercial center. However, the University sparked outrage among residents in 2009 when it halted construction due to monetary constraints.
In 2011, Harvard revived its discussion for Allston development, including residents in the planning process through a series of Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings.
While meetings sometimes saw fiery debate, tensions seemed to have cooled by the most recent meeting, with the new basketball complex serving as one of the few points of anxiety for residents.
For Mellone, the successful integration of the new venue will demonstrate if Harvard will make good on its vows of commitment to the community’s best interest.
“Overall, we’re just concerned with how the institutional plan will be managed in terms of the principles we have already agreed to,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an afternoon in the early 1990s, a gaggle of basketball players from Harvard Law School travelled an hour outside of Cambridge to a high-security prison in Walpole.
After depositing their keys, phones, and jewelry with security guards upstairs, the group descended into a monitored, basement room to face off against a team of inmates.
One imposing Walpole inmate sauntered across the room toward a skinny student who stood at the front of the group—current president Barack Obama.
Obama leaned in for a traditional handshake and hug, nonchalantly asking the inmate why he had been incarcerated.
“Double murder,” the inmate replied.
Yet, according to  Charles J. Ogletree Jr., an Obama mentor and Harvard Law School professor, Obama maintained his aggressive playing style—a fearlessness and aggressiveness that many critics have argued Obama has lost since his election in 2008.
“He’s competitive and that was reflected on the basketball court,” classmate Jason B. Adkins said.
Today, Obama remains locked in an intense struggle for the White House as election season hurdles toward its finish next Tuesday.
Although Obama generally refrains from discussing his time at Harvard Law School, the president blossomed into a leader and teacher during his three years in Cambridge.
“Harvard was, for Barack, a place to reflect, to learn and to reinforce his already very considerable skills and insights,” Law School Professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 said during the presidential campaign four years ago.
While at the Law School, Obama pioneered a new brand of activism for students who hoped to ensure that Harvard adhered to a standard of diversity and equality.
“He was definitely one of the leaders and shining lights in our year,” Adkins said.
“He knew exactly what he wanted and went about getting it done,” Law School professor David B. Wilkins ’77 said during Obama’s first campaign for president. “He was the kind of person who you knew was destined for greatness.”
THE ACTIVIST
When Barack Obama entered Harvard Law School in 1988, he had already spent three years working as a community organizer in inner-city Chicago, and at age 27, he was relatively older than his peers.
“He was a little older, seasoned,” Adkins said. “People looked up to him.”
Obama emerged as an activist during his second year at Harvard after controversy broke out surrounding the new dean, Robert C. Clark.
Clark had proposed to eliminate a branch of the advising program designed to help students find careers as public interest lawyers after graduation. Clark’s comments about these “guilt alleviating” programs drew national media attention.
Students, Obama among them, protested, organizing rallies and initiating a letter writing campaign to garner support from students and faculty members.
Obama gave several inspirational speeches that effectively galvanized students, according to Adkins.
He spoke with a distinctive style that reverberates in his speeches today. “He had a similar cadence, similar passion,” Adkins said. “It’s both passionate and analytical.”
After a period of student protests, Clark finally caved to student demands, reinstating public interest advising in 1990.
Although the controversy had died down, Obama remained active in the movement to improve the diversity of Harvard’s faculty.
“He was obviously attuned to the public issues of the day,” Adkins said.
THE SECOND TEACHER
Adkins describes Obama as a bright, engaged student with impressive intellectual ability.
During an introductory constitutional law class taught by professor Kathleen M. Sullivan, who now teaches at Stanford, Obama would consistently engage Sullivan with clear, pointed questions that challenged her interpretations.
Students, therefore, dubbed the course “the Obama-Sullivan Debate Class,” Adkins said.
“He was a dominating feature in the classroom,” Ogletree said.
Yet, Judson H. Miner, a Chicago civil rights lawyer who hired Obama immediately after he graduated, describes Obama as “self-assured but not at all cocky.”
“He was clearly an enormously bright fellow, who wasn’t arrogant,” Miner said.
In fact, Obama was eager to share recognition with his fellow students and strove to include his fellow students in dialogue, instead of merely showing off his superior knowledge.
Obama “wanted faculty and other students to see that other people in the classroom had good and interesting and provocative ideas,” Ogletree said.
Obama felt that other students contributed to a collective answer, formulated from the layered input of all the class members.
“He was as much a teaching assistant as he was a student,” Ogletree said.
Obama could have pursued an career in academia had he not chosen to dive into politics, Olgetree said.
Although Ogletree describes Obama as a “terrific teacher,” pundits have said that Obama has struggled to effectively harness his ability to translate his platform to the American public in a simple and relatable form during the last four years.
“There’s no better salesman than Barack, but there was a period when somehow his voice got muffled,” Miner said of Obama’s first term. “He followed bad advice and lost his voice.”
THE MEDIATOR
In 1990, Obama became the first African-American to pass through the grueling election process and win the much-coveted position of Harvard Law Review president.
According to Ogletree, Obama expressed some “reluctance and anxiety” about running.
“He had to be chosen by a cross-section of people who all were smart and gifted and who were different races, genders, political persuasions and even classes,” Ogletree said.
Obama “was pleasantly surprised to see the wealth of support and enthusiastic endorsement of him as the president,” Ogletree said.
At the time, Randall Kennedy, a professor of law, told the Crimson that Obama’s selection proved that “talent can be recognized regardless of race.”
According to Ogletree, Obama wanted to open doors for future students who would follow in his footsteps as leaders of the Law Review. Soon after his election, Obama said that he was happy to be the first African-American elected,
but did not want to be the last.
Although people on the Law Review held diametrically opposed political views, Obama managed to reconcile their differences because his peers respected his judgment and his fairness.
Ogletree said that Obama crafted a team of strong writers from across the political spectrum, refusing to discriminate against those who held political views that ran couner to his own.
Instead of relying on tired partisan arguments, Obama consistently approached any problem with the same thoughtfulness and precision that he applies to work in the Oval Office, Miner said.
Obama’s experience reconciling differences may have aided his navigating of the Washington poliical scene, but pundits have virulently criticized the president for the increasingly partisan tenor of Washington during the last four years.
Despite what some critics have said, Ogletree believes that Obama has successfully reached across the aisle time and again on issues that are important to the American people—particularly health care and the economic stimulus package.
And, if elected to office again, Obama—who shaped and was shaped, like many Harvard students, by his experience in Cambridge—will continue to draw upon his years at HLS, Olgetree said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rutgers English professor Rebecca L. Walkowitz ’92 identified a new genre of fiction, novels that are intended to transcend language barriers, in a lecture at the Radcliffe Institute on Wednesday afternoon.
Walkowitz, who is a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute this academic year, shared her research into “born translated fiction”—works that are written for translation and intended to be consumed by a global audience.
Most works of fiction are untranslatable, she explained, because it is impossible to replicate the original tone, format, or idea in a new language.
“They are more resistant to translation because the focus their attention on one language in particular,” Walkowitz said. “They use proper names whose cultural and historical associations are not easily rendered in another language. They generate metaphors with homonym, accent, and other vernacular effects.”
Walkowitz explained how, in contrast, writers could produce a global novel in only one language. She cited the example of South African-born author J.M. Coetzee’s “Summertime.” Coetzee structured the novel around a series of fictional interviews that, in the universe of the book, had been translated into English.
“Coetzee approaches this problem by producing his global novel in less than one language,” Walkowitz said. “That is, he presents English—his language of composition—as itself a foreign tongue. English appears in much of the novel as if it were a target language, not the original resource in which the novel begins, but the language into which words and thoughts have been rendered.”
Born translated fiction asks a different kind of focus from the reader than typical English literature, Walkowitz argued.
“On some level, attending to all of the words on all of the pages would involve reading many more editions than we can hold in our hand, or it would involve reading an edition that doesn’t really exist,” she said.
This new type of born translated fiction first emerged in the 1990s, Walkowitz said.
“There is overlap between an interest in experimentation with language and the question of what it means to write for global audiences in a global marketplace,” she said.
Janet Zong, a first year English grad student who attended the lecture, said she believes that the idea of global fiction is important to how we view culture in an era of globalization.
“World literature is such a big phrase, and people use it to mean different things,” Zong said. “[Walkowitz’s] talk shed some light on how we tend to think about things in scale instead of how everything—local and global—connects.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cardboard cutouts of bloody saws dangled from the ceiling of the elevators in New Quincy Wednesday evening. As the doors opened to the penthouse-level Masters’ Residence, a cloaked figure wielding a plastic saw jumped out—welcoming guests with a fright to the special Halloween open house.
In the dining room, plates of cookie dough eyballs, candy corn rice krispie treats, and apple pumpkin cookies surrounded a bubbling cauldron of dry ice.
Across campus, treats far outweighed tricks on Wednesday as students marked the Halloween holiday with food and festivities, from the undergraduate Houses to Memorial Church.
Several Houses marked the holiday with special study breaks and trick-or-treating between resident tutor rooms.
In Currier, tutors organized the second annual scaveger hunt trick-or-treat challenge.
“It’s really cute,” Nancy Y. Xie ’13 said just before the holiday game began. “I think I’ll partake in some of the activities, but I mostly want to thank the tutors for organizing this for us.”
Many students said they had already marked the occasion this past weekend, breaking out costumes for events including the annual Heaven and Hell party in Currier and the Freshman Dean’s Office-coordinated Scaritas and Costume Catwalk.
“I have two midterms this week, so I ate a pumpkin cookie this morning in celebration,” Abigail E. Hook ’13 said.
Breaking from the sweets-oriented streak consistent among Harvard’s other Halloween festivities, the Interfaith Council led a trick-or-treat trip through Cambridge requesting donations to Unicef.
“Service is a common ground among all of the different faiths, so it’s nice for us to come together and put work into action,” Debanjan Pain ’13, the council president, said. “We can raise money for a good cause while having a good time. Fingers crossed for no more rain.”
At Memorial Church, the Harvard Organ Society infused music into the festivities with a Wednesday evening concert.
The event, targeted specifically at drawing a freshman audience, included a reception with apple cider, candy, and seasonal snacks immediately preceding the performance.
“I’m glad that we have this event so that people can take a break from their studies and celebrate the holiday even if they’ve already celebrated it last weekend,” Zachary P. Fletcher ’15, a society member who coordinated the recital.
The excitement of Halloween had very little to do with the holiday itself for several students who visited the Harvard Square location of the Mexican restaurant Chipotle. To celebrate Halloween, the chain offersed $2 burritos to costumed customers.
“I’m so ready to have something other than Annenberg food,” Artur Meller ’16 said. “I’m pumped.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One impeccable smile. One slick shock of black hair, graying at the temples. Two Harvard degrees.
Mitt Romney has checked off the basic points of a presidential persona.
But behind the pristine grooming lies a unique political figure—a man whose time at Harvard exemplifies how his presidential credentials are at once typical and unprecedented.
So far, Romney has distanced himself from the University as he campaigns for president. He has even derided his opponent Barrack Obama, who attended the Law School, for spending too much time in the “Harvard faculty lounge.”
But in fact, Romney spent four years at Harvard to Obama’s three. And he has the diplomas to prove it—from the Business School and the Law School in 1975.
DUAL THREAT
“It’s obvious that anyone who gets into both the Business School and the Law School is pretty special,” says Malcom S. Salter ’62, a professor emeritus at Harvard Business School. Salter, along with law professor Detlev Vagts, co-chaired and helped design Harvard’s joint J.D./M.B.A program from its launch in 1969.
The dual degree program typically accepts fewer than 20 candidates each year—a cadre of super-achievers, who take classes at the Law School and the Business School to obtain both degrees in four years.
“Nearly all of them made a lot of money,” says Vagts, who chaired the program for decades and watched many of his former students succeed wildly in business and academia.
Willard Mitt Romney began this rigorous program in 1971, fresh from Brigham Young University with his wife Ann and infant son Taggart in tow. The infamous student riots of 1969 were still fresh in Harvard memory, and while Romney took classes, Richard M. Nixon was ousted from the White House—after Romney’s father had resigned from his Cabinet—and the United States began its withdrawal from the war in Vietnam.
“Everybody was filled with the political ferment that was going on in the country,” recalls Howard Brownstein, another J.D./M.B.A candidate at the time whose roommate was in Romney’s study group. “The vast majority of people going to law school at that time were some brand of liberal activist.”
“Mitt was kind of a throwback,” adds Brownstein. “He just wasn’t a part of all that.”
Professors and classmates alike remember Romney’s engaged attitude in classes at both schools. Always ready to speak when called upon, Romney brought a sports coat and his trademark clean-cut grooming to class.
“My recollection of Mitt was that his hair looked pretty much the way it does it now,” says Law School classmate Robert C. Brown with a chuckle, recalling that many law students at the time wore their hair long and attended lectures in combat fatigues.
But Romney was not the typical law student—he seemed to gravitate toward the Business School from the beginning. Across the river in Boston, the Business School remained something of a conservative enclave in a University that had been dramatically radicalized in the late 1960s. “The Charles River might as well be a moat,” Brownstein says.
According to friends, Romney had always wanted to attend business school, but his father George—longtime governor of Michigan, then Secretary of Housing—wanted him to go law school.
“He compromised—and did both,” laughs Howard Serkin, who sat next to Romney in several first-year business classes.
PREP SCHOOL ‘COUNTRY BOY’
While juggling two distinct academic fields, Romney straddled two social worlds as well—the life of the driven graduate student and that of the Mormon father.
Romney’s graduate school colleagues consistently remember him as “hard working,” “mature,” “nose to the grindstone”— a portrait that contrasts with recent accounts of his pranks and slapstick antics as a prep schooler and then as a Stanford freshman.
“Mitt was always prepared; he was really always prepared,” emphasizes Serkin, a member of Romney’s study group. “He was very demanding. He said, ‘Look, we’re a team, and we want to be number one.’”
Although he was not an intellectual standout, Romney worked hard. He graduated with honors from the Law School and finished in the top 5 percent of his Business School class. “He knows how to do his own homework, let’s put it that way,” says Salter.
Friends and acquaintances say he seemed warm and personable, contradicting his current perception as “cold” or “robotic” on television.
“I didn’t ever think of him as mechanical. He was more of country boy,” recalls Rasmussen. “And it wasn’t phony. It was really the way he was.”
Brownstein remembers that Romney would sometimes make small jokes about his abstension from caffeine, alchohol, and tobacco because of his religion. But his distinct lifestyle and young family separated him from most graduate students. Dinner with other married couples, an occasional game of pick-up basketball, and church functions filled most of his spare time.
“He was always friendly, always cheerful, but he never really opened up to a lot of people,” says Garret G. Rasmussen, a classmate in Romney’s Law School section.
Indeed, as Brown puts it, his time at Harvard was closer to an “office job” than the typical all-encompassing student schedule.
“His life was divided into work with school, work with his family, and work with his church,” says Law School classmate Mark E. Mazo.
Still, Romney interacted with classmates, often inviting friends to his suburban home in Belmont. Outside the Church, he kept his Mormonism low-key—though he attended services regularly, he never proselytzed, according to classmates. Charles Ed Haldeman, a J.D./M.B.A. classmate, says he is not even sure that he knew that Romney was Mormon at the time.
PRAGMATIST TURNED POLITICIAN
Classmates remember Romney as a man driven by pragmatic, analytical concerns mostly disconnected from the tumultous politics that defined the Watergate era.
“We had many conversations over lunch every day. Very few of them were about politics,” says Serkin. “It was very clear he just wanted to be a businessman. He loved business.”
Several remember Romney as a pragmatist, less interested in the theory taught at the Law School than the hands-on case studies essential to the Business School curriculum.
“I didn’t get the sense that he liked ideas for their own sake—only instrumentally,” says Vagts, who taught Romney in a seminar class on law and business and advised him during his time in the joint program.
Some students, like future Senator Charles E. Schumer ’71, who was one of Romney’s Law School classmates, were noted as markedly political. Romney was not, in spite of his widely known political pedigree. “I think he was just a guy who wanted to make a ton of money,” says Brown.
Like many graduates of the J.D./M.B.A. program, Romney never practiced law, and several of his peers remark on traces of his Business School training in his political style.
Haldeman, who served as CEO of Freddie Mac, says he sees the hallmarks of a Harvard-trained private equity manager in Romney’s record of political negotiation. Attending two institutions as politically different as the Law and Business Schools can have a moderating influence on a J.D./M.B.A.’s outlook, he adds.
“Some political balance comes to someone who’s gone through these two schools at a such a unique time,” says Haldeman.
Given his data-driven, adaptable approach, perhaps it is not surprising that some old classmates see a different Mitt when they turn on the television.
“When I see him on the TV attacking President Obama or taking extreme positions, he doesn’t seem like he’s being natural,” says Brownstein. “It’s an adopted persona.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All Hallow’s Eve is here once again, and although the weekend has already come and gone and Hurricane Sandy may have ruined the week for many along the East Coast, hopefully there are still those students who are willing to dress up, get out, and swipe all the free candy they can get. Inevitably, there are those procrastinators out there still looking for costume ideas, and the Crimson is here to help with some last-minute Harvard-sports themed getup suggestions.
The Harvard baseball team made rounds on the internet this year with their “Call Me Maybe” rendition, and if that's good enough to get them looks from the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, then the costume can probably work for most people, if you don’t mind being one pop-culture phenomenon behind. Another simple choice: men’s ice hockey goalie Raphael Girard.
In terms of current Harvard athletics faculty, men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker is probably the most recognizable figure. All you need is a basketball sweater, clipboard, and a whistle to round out the attire. Alternatively, scrounge up a throwback Duke jersey to help reminisce of the glory days; yes, that's our basketball coach being guarded by the great MJ.
Crimson sports alumni costumes are also always a solid choice and hold a better chance of being widely recognized. The obvious choice in this regard would be to don your Linsanity jersey and get a crewcut, but your Knicks jerseys are by now sadly out of date, unless you get your hands on a Houston shirt. The more fun option, though, could be Bills quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick; a Buffalo or Crimson jersey is easy enough to come by but one of these is necessary to really paint the whole picture.
Last but not least, we present the Crimson sports writer: stained sports sweatshirt, taped glasses, tape recorder, mismatched socks, and an unnecessary amount of sports knowledge coupled with minimal athletic ability are all you need to pull off the typical Harvard sports nerd.

This coming Saturday, the Harvard women’s soccer team will square off against Columbia in the last game of the regular season, in which the Crimson looks to extend its win streak against the Lions to five.
 
When Harvard (8-5-3, 2-3-1 Ivy) meets Columbia (6-8-1, 2-3-1 Ivy) at Soldiers Field, the game will hold special meaning for its six seniors, Alexandra Conigliaro, Alicia Johnson, Alexandra Millet, Aisha Price, as well as Catherine E. Coppinger and Taryn I. Kurcz, who are both Crimson sports executives. The group will be honored with a ceremony for Senior Day, which will look to recognize their contributions over the past four years. The veteran group was part of the teams that won Ivy League titles in both 2009 and 2011.
 
“It’s been an up and down season but the seniors have really been a great guiding influence, especially to our younger players,” junior co-captain Peyton Johnson said.
 
While the Crimson is no longer in Ivy title contention after recent losses to conference leaders Princeton and Dartmouth, the team stands right in the middle of the Ancient Eight, tied with the Lions for third place. The two teams have identical league records, while Harvard holds an edge in overall wins.
 
“Something to really fight for is ending [the regular season] on a win,” Johnson said.
 
When the two teams squared off last November, the Crimson topped Columbia, 1-0. The lone goal was scored by sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke and was assisted by sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby. The pair led the team in shots, with four each. Lions goalkeeper Lillian Klein was left to scramble for four saves, while her offense pressured sophomore goalkeeper Bethany Kanten for two saves.
 
Casscells-Hamby has led the team in scoring this year. The sophomore has had six goals in the 14 games in which she has played. She also leads in points, nabbing 15, and has totaled 52 shots. Casscells-Hamby is trailed by junior forward Elizabeth Weisman, who has scored five goals over 42 shots for Harvard, and accumulated 11 points.
 
This year, Columbia arrives in Cambridge not having won an Ivy game since defeating Brown on Sept 29. Since then, the Lions have faltered against Penn, the Tigers, as well as the Big Green and most recently had a 1-1 double overtime battle against Yale. Columbia’s other conference win came against Cornell. 
 
This season, the Lions have attempted 162 shots as a team, with 74 of those coming on on-goal attempts and 16 making it into the net. Junior midfielders Beverly Leon and Coleen Rizzo have brought the offensive power and the duo leads the team in goals with six each. Leon has attempted 30 shots while Rizzo trails closely with 28.
 
Sophomore goalkeeper Grace Redmon has netted a save percentage of .812 this year, seizing 69 shots during the course of the year.
 
“Columbia’s going to be a really good team,” Kanten said. “They’ve been doing really well this season and scoring lots of goals. I think we’re just going to have to be prepared for that and stay focused even though we know it’s our last game.”
 
The Crimson is fresh off a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Dartmouth last weekend. The game saw Big Green forward Tasha Wilkins fire off two goals on Kanten, who had seven saves for the game and attempted the only shot on goal for Harvard. Kanten’s season average is 3.6 saves per game.
The sophomore prepares to close out her season with a save percentage of .752 over 58 saves.
 
“We were disappointed that we didn’t come out strong and make Dartmouth respond to us,” Johnson said. “I think we’re going to try to practice that mindset of coming out and initiating the game against Columbia. That’s how we hope to be moving forward.”
 
As the Crimson is out of contention for the title, and thus will not be likely to make the NCAA tournament, this may be the last time that the seniors suit up in Crimson. 
 
“We love our seniors so much,” Kanten said. “It’s going to be a big day for us be able to celebrate that, to play for them, to show them how much we care about them, and how much they mean to us by playing hard and getting a win for them on their Senior Day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four seniors on the Harvard men’s soccer team will try for their last win at home against Columbia on Saturday night.
The graduating class of midfielder Scott Prozeller, defender Richard Smith, and forwards Brian Rodgers and Zack Wolfenzon will play at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium with its squad for the last time, with Harvard (2-9-3, 0-4-1 Ivy) hoping to emerge with its first Ivy League victory of the season against the Lions (3-7-4, 1-2-2 Ivy).
“It won’t change much, at least not during the game,” said Prozeller, who serves as co-captain with Smith. “But leading up to it and especially after it, there will be a lot of emotions around the game.”
The Crimson seniors have taken on different roles on the team, but each has made an impact this season. Wolfenzon, along with rookies Oliver White and Jake Freeman, leads the team with three goals, including a game-winning goal in double overtime against BU earlier this month.
Rodgers, who suffered from a season-ending injury last year, returned to the pitch early this season and has been effective off the bench, racking up four shots in five games.
Prozeller, with one goal and one assist, and Smith have started every game this season, providing consistency in the midfield and backline. Off the field, they have worked to boost team morale and create a positive team environment.
“They have tried to do things that fit our individual team, rather than the way things have been done in the past,” junior defender Ross Friedman said. “I think we have seen a lot of results in the locker room.”
The team is anticipating a competitive match with Columbia, which currently sits in sixth place in the Ivy League to Harvard’s seventh.
“[The Lions] are kind of going through the same thing we are struggling in the Ivy League,” Friedman said. “We are excited to really go for our first Ivy League win of the season and do it for the seniors.”
The Lions have only one win in the Ancient Eight thus far against Penn, which the Crimson will face next week in its last contest of the season.
“From the years past, [Columbia is] a very technical team but not the most athletic team, so I think that plays to our strengths,” Prozeller said. “We have had good matchups against them in the past, and we are expecting the same on Saturday.”
Harvard will need to maintain the level of play for the whole game in order to pull off a win. Last week against Dartmouth, the Crimson carried a 1-1 tie into the 76th minute before allowing two consecutive goals to drop the contest, 3-1.
“It’s kind of a self-belief thing at this point where we have seen a lot of goals go in in the last 20 minutes of the game,” Friedman said. “How are we going to prevent that from happening? How are we, in the last 20 minutes, going to dig in and score a goal for ourselves rather than getting scored on?”
The Harvard offense has shown potential, getting shut out only four times this season, but it has struggled to finish when it matters most. In its seven games that have gone into overtime this season, Harvard has gone 1-3-3.
“In most of the games we have played, we have had spells of 60 minutes or 55 minutes where we have really dominated the game,” Prozeller said. “But we haven’t been able to put together a full 90 where we have had that focus.”
The Crimson has benefited from a pair of freshman goalkeepers, Evan Mendez and Joe Festa, who each hold a .714 save percentage. The two have combined to allow 26 goals this season, with Mendez making the last four starts.
Columbia has had close matches all season, winning only once by more than one goal. Its offense is led by midfielder Henning Sauerbier and forward Nick Scott with two goals apiece.
In goal for the Lions, Kyle Jackson has seen the majority of the starts this season and boasts a .810 save percentage. Keeping up the intensity throughout the match will be imperative for Harvard to break down Columbia’s defense, which has allowed only 15 goals all year.
“[Consistency] is still something that we are working towards,” Prozeller said. “If we are able to stay focused then we should be able to get a win on Saturday.”
Harvard dropped its last two matchups against the Lions, but both were close contests.
“We have a game plan and just like every game, and we want to execute it,” Prozeller said. “The fact that it is the seniors’ last game is important, but it’s not going to change how we play the game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Jellybeans! Jellybeans!”
A swarm of kindergarteners flocks towards senior Joey Novak at Cunniff Elementary School on a sunny Friday morning. Novak—known affectionately as “Jellybeans” by many students because “his name sounds like ‘jellybeans’”—travels to Watertown, Mass. every Friday morning with fellow members of the Harvard baseball team to serve as a positive male role model for the students at Cunniff.
“The kids definitely look forward to them coming every single week, and they know exactly what time they’re coming,” said Shannon Sauder, a second grade teacher at the school. Pointing to her students, she then added, “These guys knew that the baseball guys were coming around 10-something today so they kept watching the clock and asking, ‘Is it almost time? Is it almost time?’ So they really look forward to their visit and always try to impress them when they come.”
During their weekly visits, Novak and his teammates spend a few hours interacting with kindergarten through fifth grade students in their daily activities. While Novak may be playing with the kids in physical education, senior Matt Doyle is working one-on-one with a student on how to behave in class, and junior Peter Kaplan is helping to teach team building skills through tinkering with K’Nex. Other members of the baseball team are probably working with the students on their reading or writing skills.
“[The kids] listen to them like they’re Santa Claus or something,” Sauder said. “A few weeks ago, [Kaplan] read to the whole class about tornadoes, and now they fight over who gets to have that tornado book in their book bin.”
The program between Cunniff Elementary and the Harvard baseball team began last year through the efforts of Brent Suter ’12, who wanted to get more involved with the local community, and Dr. Cindy Crimmin, Cunniff’s principal at the time. Dr. Crimmin realized that the school had no male teachers, and, as a result, many students lacked a positive male role model in their lives.
“The kids would say, ‘There are no men here,’” explained Elaine Antonellis, Cunniff’s behavior specialist and primary liaison for the program since Dr. Crimmin left.
Even if there is a father or adult male present in the household, a lot of times the kids are just looking for that extra attention from someone who they look up to and who is successful in their eyes,” added Mrs. Gallagher, a teacher for the fourth grade.
Suter and Dr. Crimmin worked out an arrangement where the Harvard baseball team would visit the classrooms every Friday morning. While the initial guidelines were only for the young men to be good role models, the program’s structure has organically become more defined over time.
“About five of us went the first week,” Doyle said. “And then we were hooked. We’ve made it bigger this year, and we’re trying to grow it even more.”
With its presence in the classrooms on a weekly basis, the Harvard baseball team has already left lasting impressions on the students at Cunniff Elementary.
“I really like when they come,” fourth grade student Giovanni Reyes said. “That’s why I like Fridays. Matt helps me makes the right decisions so I don’t get in trouble.... I don’t want him to graduate and leave.”
The teachers see a difference in the kids, as well.
"The [Harvard] guys have major impacts on the kids,” Sauder said. “The kids work harder and better when they’re here, and they work better together as a team because they try to impress them—which is good.”
As a treat to the students, the teachers and parents of the children organized a field trip to go watch a Harvard baseball game against Boston College last April.
In the week leading up to the game, the students of Cunniff Elementary put together a pep rally for their mentors, which included big banners, cheers, and Harvard pennants that they brought to the game.
“They worked really hard on them and wanted to look up all the pictures of Harvard logos and things to put on them,” Sauder said. “They brought them home, and some of them keep what they made in their lockers.”
But while the Cunniff children were being entertained at the game, the Harvard baseball team was also clearly affected by the students’ presence.
“It was awesome to see the kids there at the game,” Doyle said. “The whole experience is so rewarding and incredible. Seeing them come give you a hug every Friday when you get there—it just makes you weak.”
“It’s really neat for me to see how genuinely interested the kids are in learning and just hanging around us,” senior Jordan Haviland echoed. “We’re usually all pretty tired when we get over there in the morning, but we all leave in really good moods and are feeling pretty great about the world when we get out of there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team’s season opener less than two weeks away, The Back Page is breaking down the Crimson’s non-conference opponents. Each week, we will take a look at two new foes. Earlier this week, we profiled Fordham. Next up is Boston College.
On Dec. 4, the Harvard men’s basketball team will make the short drive to Chestnut Hill to take on Boston College.  The Crimson’s victory over the Eagles last year marked the 1,000th win in program history.  Harvard has won the last four contests against BC and looks to make it five in a row when the teams meet again this season.
Last year, the Eagles got a quick start and found themselves with an early 14-3 lead.  But the Crimson stormed back thanks to strong perimeter shooting, going 10-of-20 from outside the arc.  With a comfortable 40-33 lead at the half, Harvard ultimately took the game by a wide margin, winning 67-46.
Then-sophomore Laurent Rivard led the way for the Harvard offense, netting 18 points for Crimson.  Senior Keith Wright tallied a team-high 11 rebounds, while junior Brandyn Curry paced Harvard with five steals in addition to 11 points.
The young BC team returns many of its starting core players.  Last year’s Eagles squad featured 11 newcomers, five of whom started consistently throughout the season.  But BC will still need a big game from key players if it hopes to end a four-year drought to its crosstown rival.
Last year as a freshman, center Dennis Clifford tallied a team-high 14 points against the Crimson.  Clifford also led the Eagles in field goal percentage (.529) and blocks (29) on the season.
BC went on to go 9-22 last year, finishing 4-12 in conference play.  The team was ousted by North Carolina State in the first round of the ACC Tournament.
This season, Clifford will look to provide offensive power alongside fellow sophomore Patrick Heckmann, who added 13 points for the Eagles in last year’s game against Harvard.  Incoming freshmen Oliver Hanlan and Joe Rahon also look to provide strong backcourt support for BC this year.
A familiar face—this time on the opposing bench— will be Andrew Van Nest, who joined the BC squad this year after spending four seasons with the Crimson. Van Nest returns for his last year of eligibility after missing his entire freshman season at Harvard due to a torn rotator cuff.

"I'm too busy" is never a good excuse to skimp on exciting and delicious food escapades. In this new series, explore the culinary scene of Boston and Cambridge with Jane, your Crimson foodie who may be picky, but will still try anything on the plate at least once (except maybe chicken feet).
If you thought Boston was a mere college town, then think again. Home to some of the best restaurants in the world, Boston boasts a myriad of cuisines in its diverse neighborhoods, from authentic Italian in the North End to high-end classics in Back Bay. To help hungry eaters navigate through this eclectic culinary scene, Boston magazine publishes an annual list of top 50 Best Restaurants in the area.
This year, 13 restaurants in Cambridge made the cut, including three local favorites from Harvard Square. In this edition of Food Talk, you can vicariously experience a five-course gastronomic journey as we explore a dish each from five different Cantabrigian restaurants that made this year's list.
First Appetizer: Crispy Sweetbreads ($16) from Rialto
Lightly breaded and fried sweetbreads—or thymus glands of chickens—sit atop creamy Parmesan risotto and red currant jelly in this delectable appetizer from Rialto, a highly acclaimed restaurant at the Charles Hotel. The dish is finished off with some crunchy pine nuts and soft raisins for a pleasant combination of sweet and savory.
Second Appetizer: Margherita Pizza ($11/small, $18/large) from Area Four 
About a 15-minute bike ride from Harvard Square, a chef donning a white apron slides pizza dough topped with fresh mozzarella, pecorino, basil, and tomatoes into wood-fired ovens at Area Four near MIT. Once the cheese oozes into the dough, he sprinkles some more basil leaves on top before serving this Margherita Pizza to the diners. 
Main: Sumac Spiced Loch Duarte Scottish Salmon ($30) from Harvest
Tucked away on Brattle Street, in the heart of Harvard Square, Harvest incorporates fresh local ingredients to create dishes like Sumac Spiced Loch Duarte Scottish Salmon. Although the farm-raised, pan-fried Scottish salmon was slightly greasy and overcooked, a bed of vanilla scented parsnips, fennel, and roasted cipollini onions underneath made up for its lackluster main ingredient.
Dessert: Butterscotch and Passion Fruit Pudding with Warm Pound Cake Croutons ($9) from  Catalyst 
Located just a couple steps away from Area Four, Catalyst offers tantalizing desserts that are well worth saving room for in your stomach. The rich butterscotch and passion fruit pudding, topped with a dollop of whipped cream and some candied walnuts, acts as a perfect dipping sauce for scrumptious pieces of fried pound cake. These dense, yet moist, fried sticks are reminiscent of churros without the overly sweet sugar and cinnamon coating. Don't think about your expanding waistline—just enjoy the heaven in front of you.
Late Night: Island Creek Oysters ($2.50/each, $1 after 11 p.m.) from Russell House Tavern
A popular destination for college students looking to enjoy drinks while mingling with their friends, Russell House Tavern also has great bargains on some of its bar foods, including Island Creek Oysters. After 11 p.m., the oysters are only $1 a shell. The oysters, served with sweet pickle mignonette and old bay cocktail sauce, were juicy, but not quite as plump as they could have been.

Get Out the Vote in Allston 
Saturday, November 3 - Monday, November 5
On a more serious note, the IOP is reaching out to residents of Ward 22, Precinct 1, in nearby Allston, and making it their mission to get people to the polls this election day. The Community Action Committee has been assigned over 850 doors to visit. Volunteers can sign up here.
CORRECTION: Nov. 1, 2012
A previous version of this post said that "40 million registered voters in Allston did not vote in 2010." This is clearly incorrect and hence has been deleted!

It's November, and you know what that means: the abandonment of basic hygiene to raise awareness for turkey inequality (or was it prostate cancer?). That's right, "No Shave November" is here. If you are looking for other reasons why you should ditch your razor and any potential job prospects, look no further - Flyby has got your back with some practical reasons for growing a beard this month.
1. It's cheap. 
Think of all the money you'll save on scarves by growing a beard. You'll also save on laundry and new clothes, as no one will expect high-end fashion (or knowledge of how to use detergent) from someone who looks like a character from Castaway.
2. It's a great Thanksgiving icebreaker. 
What better way to get a conversation started than with a face full of hair? If you're worried about that awkward conversation with your mother about a lack of grandchildren, just change the subject with a subtle tug on your new facial distraction.
3. Support women's rights. 
Women can take part in No Shave November as well. Not only is this a feminist cause, (the right to facial hair), but also it will help with getting that coveted "bearded lady" internship at the circus. But even if Barnum and Bailey isn't hiring, women will benefit from all the other pros to facial hair (see below.).
4. It can hold anything. 
Beards are the original murse. There is no limit on how much you can fit it there. Worried about missing Flyby? Just stick some cereal or a hunk of cheese in your beard. It's also a great place to keep your room key. You'll never need a fanny pack again.
5. It makes for a great costume. 
If you carry it on over to December, you're already halfway to your Santa uniform. All you need now is a red jacket and a bell and you've got yourself a part-time job at the mall. For those who don't celebrate Christmas, you can keep the beard until springtime and impress everyone with your Moses costume.
