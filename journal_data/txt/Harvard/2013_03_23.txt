After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Quiz Bowl team was stripped of four national championship titles Wednesday after organizers of the National Academic Quiz Tournaments, LLC, discovered that the team’s former president accessed game questions in advance of tournament matches.
Andrew M. Watkins ’11, who competed for Harvard’s team in its four championship victories between 2009 and 2011, exploited a security loophole to illicitly view game questions online, according to an announcement on NAQT’s website. The company said its server logs indicated that Watkins, who at that time was paid to write questions for NAQT’s high school tournament, repeatedly viewed a page that revealed the first 40 characters of questions slated for use in the same tournaments in which he would soon compete.
Now that the four national titles Harvard won between 2009 and 2011 have been revoked, NAQT will recognize the University of Minnesota, Virginia Commonwealth University, and the University of Chicago as champions for tournaments in those years. For violating the tournament’s rules, NAQT suspended Watkins’s membership and barred him from writing and editing for the company.
In a statement provided to NAQT, Watkins acknowledged “breaches of question security.” He maintained that he competed “in good faith,” but also issued an apology to his former teammates, the NAQT, and the community for his actions.
“My immaturity damaged my much-prized relationship with NAQT and cast undue doubt on three remarkable accomplishments by three Harvard teams,” Watkins said in the statement. “It will surprise no one that my mental health as an undergraduate was always on the wrong side of ‘unstable,’ but that does not excuse my actions, nor does it ameliorate the damage done.”
Watkins was not immediately available for comment.
Although the announcement on NAQT’s website said that organizers had “neither direct nor statistical evidence” that Watkins benefited from his inappropriate access to game questions in tournament play, the company maintained that “the mere possession of it goes against competitors’ expectations of fair play.”
NAQT President Robert Hentzel emphasized that Watkins’s breach was made possible by a security flaw in an NAQT web page and was not the result of a surreptitious hack.
“He didn’t break into anything,” Hentzel said. “The website displayed things that it shouldn’t have, and he saw it.”
After Harvard’s team won championships in two different divisions in 2009 and 2010, rivals began to speculate that Watkins had accessed questions beforehand, Hentzel said. Current Harvard Quiz Bowl Vice President Stephen Liu ’14, who as a freshman played with Watkins on the 2011 championship team, recalled that “unofficial rumors were circulating” among opposing teams after Harvard’s 2011 victory.
Hentzel said that after receiving these complaints, NAQT investigated the security of their question server, but found nothing suspicious.
In 2012, NAQT officials discovered the security flaw on their own and fixed it. An anonymous tipster later informed the company that Joshua Alman, another college player, had used the loophole to help take home a 2012 national championship title for MIT. After conducting an internal investigation, the NAQT revoked MIT’s title and banned Alman from the organization for life.
Only then, when NAQT investigated the server logs for all writers and tournaments, did organizers stumble on suspicious activity, believed to be unconnected, on the accounts of Watkins and two other writers, Hentzel said.
Hentzel said the frequency and timing of Wakins’s visits to the errant page made officials suspect that the activity was not coincidental.
“The number of hits to the page and the fact that they occurred in the time period immediately before the championship in question really made us say that there’s no doubt that he could have had access,” Hentzel said.
Hentzel emphasized that NAQT officials believe Watkins acted alone.
“There is no evidence to suggest that any of his teammates knew anything about this,” he said. NAQT has not leveled any sanctions or penalties on Harvard’s team, and no other Harvard players have been reprimanded.
Liu said that at the time, teammates noted that Watkins, a chemistry concentrator who specialized in science questions, performed unusually well in history and literature topics at national tournaments. After correctly answering a question on the history of Thailand in the 2011 national championship round against the University of Minnesota, Watkins told The Crimson that history was generally not his strong suit.
“It was not in a category that I’m comfortable with or generally speaking, good at,” Watkins said at the time. “But with only a few seconds [to react], you can’t really induce your teammates to answer the question.”
Liu said he thinks that NQAT’s decision to strip Harvard of its championships was fair.
“Those other teams definitely deserve those victories,” he said. “It’s really unfortunate that they didn’t get to spend that year between 2011 and 2012 championships celebrating that victory.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
After upsetting New Mexico to win their first round match-up, the Crimson will take on the Arizona Wildcats on Saturday (6:10 EST, TNT) in the round of 32. With a Sweet Sixteen bid on the line, staff writer David Freed breaks down the individual matchups at stake for the Crimson.
 
As detailed in the previous part of the preview (LINK HERE), the Crimson stands a better chance against the Wildcats than it did against New Mexico. While all the odds were thrown out of the window in Harvard’s 68-62 victory over the Lobos, the Crimson match up better with the smaller, less defensive-minded Wildcats.
 
Point Guard: Siyani Chambers vs. Mark Lyons
Looking at the matchup, the individual battle that leaps off the page is the freshman Chambers against the senior Lyons. This will be Lyons’ ninth tournament game; Chambers’ second. Lyons plays in a tougher conference for a team ranked 75 spots ahead of Harvard by Ken Pomeroy yet the statistics favor Chambers. Lyons is an excellent free throw shooter (85 percent) but from the field (42 percent) and the arc (32 percent), he is below average. Chambers, in addition to being Harvard’s floor general and emotional leader, shoots 44 percent from both the field and deep. Although both guards turn it over at a similar rate (2.8 a game for Lyons, 3.4 for Chambers), Chambers averages nearly three more assists per game and has a better assist to turnover ratio (1.7 to 1.1).
The key will be the ability of Chambers to beat Lyons off the dribble. Lyons got to the hoop at will against bigger Belmont guards, using his speed to get past the slower Bruins. He is excellent at using his body to create space between defenders, intentionally drawing contact to prevent shot-blockers from rejecting his attempts. Chambers will need to stay in front of the Xavier transfer and make him take shots from three, where the Crimson can live with the occasional make. On the offensive side of the ball, Chambers must do the opposite to Lyons—crashing into the lane at will and opening up avenues for Harvard’s shooters on the outside.
 
Shooting Guard: Wesley Saunders vs. Nick Johnson 
If neither coach shuffles around their lineups to adjust for his opponent, this is a matchup Harvard has a chance to dominate. Johnson is not a large two guard at six-three and 200 pounds, and goes up against the Ivy League Player of the Year in Saunders. Saunders, in addition to being the Crimson’s best defender, is Harvard’s best player off the dribble and excels at absorbing contact and creating space in midair. Johnson will have a hard time stopping Saunders from driving past him without help—help that Arizona can ill afford to give with the shooters surrounding Saunders.
Johnson is an excellent shot in his own right, however. The sophomore marksman hits more than 37 percent of his threes and nearly 45 percent of his shots overall. He scored in double figures in 17 of the Wildcats’ first 20 games and is a more efficient and complete scorer than Lyons. He will test Saunders’ ability to challenge shots on the perimeter. To get Johnson open looks, Wildcat coach Sean Miller will likely run Saunders ragged through a number of off-ball screens. If Johnson can take advantage and stretch the floor, it will add yet another dimension to the Wildcat offense.
 
Small Forward: Laurent Rivard vs. Kevin Parrom 
Rivard followed up his stellar 2012 introduction to tournament play (20 points, six of seven from behind the arc) with a 17-point performance against the Lobos. His early treys gave Harvard momentum and he stopped a New Mexico run by drawing a foul on a three-pointer attempt just before the under-eight minutes media timeout in the second half. Rivard’s three-point shooting keys the Crimson offense, opening up the floor for drives by Chambers and Saunders. When he gets going, the team is hard to beat. It’s no coincidence that Rivard has made four or more threes in each of Harvard’s biggest four wins (California, New Mexico, vs. Princeton, vs. Cornell).
Parrom, a rangy 6-6 wing from the Bronx, will try to outmuscle Rivard and knock him off his spots on the floor. New Mexico’s Cameron Bairstow admitted after the game he lost track of the Quebec native twice in the corners, leading to open looks Rivard knocked down. Parrom cannot let that happen and must force Rivard into passing the ball. On the offensive end, the stronger Wildcat can most effectively attack Rivard by posting up and attacking the smaller Crimson defender in isolation.
 
Power Forward: Christian Webster vs. Solomon Hill 
In a matchup of two seniors, the ability of both to rebound will be crucial to the outcome of the game. Webster is not a prolific rebounder—the Washington, D.C. native averages only three a game—but will have to mitigate Hill’s effect on the boards by effectively boxing out. Hill averages just five rebounds this season but averaged 7.7 a year ago. Against the smaller Webster, Hill will have a chance to dominate the interior against a weak rebounding Crimson squad. If he can do so, Arizona can get away with going big on offense, which allows it to match up better with the Crimson shooters on defense. Webster recently passed 1,000 total points for his career and is a prolific three-point shooting threat the Wildcats will need to account for on defense. Webster tends to drift to the corner for kick-outs from Chambers and Saunders and, much like Parrom, Hill must take away those corner threes for the Wildcats to execute its game plan on defense.
 
Center: Kenyatta Smith vs. Kaleb Tarczewski
Harvard doesn’t face the size disadvantage against the Wildcats across the board that it did against the Lobos, but Tarczewski may evoke memories of the Lobos’ seven-foot interior terror, Alex Kirk. The freshman averages only seven points a game but had 12 against Belmont and didn’t miss a shot from the floor against the undersized front line of the Bruins. Smith was the only Crimson defender strong enough to stand up to Kirk in the round of 64, and Harvard will count on him to stay out of foul trouble and counter a second seven-footer against Arizona. Smith’s defensive rebounding and block percentages, according to Ken Pomeroy, would be best in the country if he had enough minutes to qualify and he is an excellent interior defender. Tarczewski benefits from guards that can drive the lane at will, setting him up with easy looks. It will be up to Smith to seal off the lane and force Tarczewski and the Wildcat guards away from the basket, forcing them to beat the Crimson on the perimeter. If the sophomore can do that, Harvard will nullify one of the strongest parts of the Wildcat offense.
 
Bench:
As with most every matchup, the Crimson are at a disadvantage when it comes to bench play. Coach Tommy Amaker is not shy about running his big dogs (Saunders, Chambers, Rivard, etc.) thirty five or more minutes a game if the situation depends on it and there is no true guard to back any of them up. Sophomore big men Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis help spell Smith on the interior and allow Amaker to experiment with two-big lineups, but the rotation is capped at seven. The Wildcats, by contrast, have nine players who have played in at least 27 games this season. Forwards Brandon Ashley and Grant Jerrett provide valuable bench minutes for Miller, helping to spell Tarczewski, who only plays about 22 minutes a game. Jerrett is the best three-point shooting threat the Wildcats have at 41 percent and little-used Gabe York also provides 35 percent accuracy from deep for Sean Miller.
With two guard-heavy teams taking the court on Saturday, the battle will be decided on the perimeter. Harvard needs Chambers and Saunders to dominate their matchups against Lyons and Johnson, respectively, to slow down the potent Wildcat attack and keep the quick Arizona guards in front of them. For Arizona, the key will be for Hill and Tarczewski to beat the Crimson to loose balls and win the rebounding battle. Harvard is one of the worst rebounding teams in the country and if the Wildcats can exploit that, they can extend possessions and test the occasionally impatient Crimson perimeter defenders. Each team has a simple blueprint for success; to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, one must simply out-execute the other.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
True story: My grandmother called this morning to ask if I watched Harvard win its first basketball game ever over Mexico.
Well, not quite, but I do believe that we just won.
Thursday night, Harvard put the Madness back in March. Here’s a quick test to see if you have seen a television or computer in the last 24 hours:
What exactly happened in Salt Lake City?
A)    Harvard beat New Mexico, marking the first NCAA tournament win in school history.
B)    An anchor on SportsCenter referred to Harvard’s win as “the biggest thing to happen to Harvard athletics since the baseball team’s Call Me Maybe video went viral.”
C)     The Mountain West conference proved to be a bit overrated, as an Ivy League school stunned its best team and Cal—which lost to that same Ivy League team—upset its second-best team, UNLV
D)    Siyani and Laurant are now the most popular male baby names in the country.
E)     All of the above
Okay, so maybe “overrated” is a strong word to use… But Harvard really stuck it to the Mountain West.
Harvard basketball has once again entered the Twitter-sphere. There haven’t been this many Harvard-related hashtags since Linsanity. Here are our favorite tweets about Thursday’s historic game.
1) SportsCenter started its coverage early, tweeting about Harvard’s big lead with 3 minutes to go:
“In 102 seasons, #Harvard has won 1034 games, but NEVER had a victory in NCAA Tournament. With 3:00 left, Crimson leads New Mexico by 6.”
Look, we appreciate the attention, but this is how jinxes occur.  Harvard sports might not be the greatest, but the student body certainly doesn’t need anyone else to pump up its ego.
Just after the final buzzer sounded, ESPN broke the news (and Twitter, and the hearts of everyone in New Mexico):
“No. 14 Harvard just beat No. 3 New Mexico. They probably did this to your bracket -> pic.twitter.com/wSuj8ncvZX”
Whoah, speak for yourself there.  We have the Crimson going all the way…in our alternate brackets…
2) Of course, ESPN did not stand alone in its coverage of the game.  Soon after Harvard reminded the country that it has a basketball team (a fairly good one, we might add) media outlets ran with the story. Kenny Smith, former All-Star with the Houston Rockets and an analyst on TNT’s NBA Countdown, had this to say:
“10 years from now a bunch of lawyers and doctors will b saying " I won in the NCAA TOURNY"! Lol.. #congratsharvard”
Remember, Kenny, there are over 400,000 NCAA athletes, and just about all of them will be going pro in something other than sports. We all can’t reach the professional ranks. But hey, thanks for the reminder that Harvard students will never reach the 1%.
3) David Portnoy, founder and president of Barstoolsports.com, focused on Harvard’s bench while watching the game:
“This Harvard kid doing the 3 goggles is so Harvard. Probably trading stock during commercial breaks http://ow.ly/i/1JBV0 “
It’s not nice to profile, David. “Just because a Harvard student is an economics concentrator doesn’t necessarily mean he wants to go into finance,” said no one ever.
4) Pete Pranica, the Memphis Grizzlies play-by-play announcer, is worried about the implications of Harvard’s win:
“Who would have thought Coach Cal would be 0-1 in NIT and Harvard 1-0 in the NCAA? Are these the end times? #GoCrimson”
Don’t worry Pete, the passing of 2012 proved that the Mayans were wrong. But you should get used to penciling Harvard into the later rounds of the tournament.    Welcome to the new age.
5) Assistant basketball coach Yanni Hufnagel tweeted out a picture during the post-game celebrations:
“Harvard Basketball!!!!!!!!!!!!!! @ EnergySolutions Arena http://instagram.com/p/XJXSJvOJBs/ “
And do the Harvard Shake.
6) Chris Lorditch ’12, former Harvard wide-receiver, is excited about the Crimson’s prospects in the next round:
“That. Was. Awesome. I'll never forget that. Arizona has a bball team?? #whoknew #bringonthecats”
We like your confidence, Chris. So far, so good against southwestern states.  Just saying.
7) And then there was Jeremy Lin.  Harvard basketball’s biggest fan did a little trash-talking before the game, and then went on a tweeting after the buzzer:
3:47 PM: “"@ChandlerParsons: Whats your #FinalFour?" Where is @hoopsatharvard?!?” In the library." Whatever...learn to read”
 7:06 PM: “Getting ready to watch HARVARD beat new mexico on TNT!! #gocrimson http://instagram.com/p/XJG3jNOP-S/ “
7:40 PM: “Can I get fined for criticizing the NCAA refs in this game?!? @crimson_0 heating up!!”
7:50 PM: “hahah @crimson_0 with the 3-point goggles! @SChambers4 playin with 1 shoe and @wes_goood doin work! @CWebbie15 with the 3! #losingmyvoice”
9:23 PM: “YYYYYEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!! HARVARD winssss!!! hahahahhah i told you.... #threepointgoggles #bracketbusters pic.twitter.com/ZlpqTFCPtM”
Ladies and Gentleman, we give you Jeremy Lin: NBA starting point guard, unabashed Harvard alumnus, and certified Masshole. How could the Knicks not re-sign this guy?
Oh, and Drew Faust will be expecting a check now that the administration knows you watch the games.  Unfortunately, you can’t hold out because they know exactly how much you are making.  Doesn’t “Jeremy Lin Pavilion” have a nice ring to it?
Those are your tweets of the week.  If you need some more Harvard-related tweets in your life, just ask this guy. Otherwise…
“Ten Thousand Men of Harvard Gained Victory Today, For They Know that Over Old [Lobos], Fair Harvard Holds Sway…”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preparation for Harvard’s third-round matchup against the Arizona Wildcats (26-7, 12-6 Pac-12) on Saturday (6:10 EST, TNT), staff writer David Freed takes a look at the Wildcats’ tape from their Thursday 81-64 win over the Belmont Bruins and takes a look at both what bodes ill and well for the Crimson’s chances against the Wildcats on Saturday.
In previous installments of this preview, I’ve looked at Arizona’s resume and individual matchups with the Crimson. However, going beyond the stats and assessing a team with the ‘eye test’ brings a different perspective. For the Wildcats, it shows the disproportionate affect that senior point guard Mark Lyons has on the offense as well as the strategy Wildcat coach Sean Miller will likely employ to slow down the Crimson shooters.
The choice to review this game was prompted by the fact that Belmont is a fairly similar team to Harvard offensively. The Bruins shoot 38.3 percent from deep as a team and start three players that shoot better than the team average from three. Swingman Ian Clark averages 18 points a game and his .543/.833/.459 shooting splits (field goal percentage/free throw percentage/three point percentage) aren’t that different from those of Harvard sophomore Wesley Saunders (.538/.732/.500). Belmont is taller than Harvard and starts three players six-six or taller compared to just the Crimson’s one. The two teams have similar offensive philosophies of playing inside-out and derive their strengths from strong outside shooters and crafty finishers inside (Clark and Kerron Johnson for Belmont, Saunders and freshman Siyani Chambers for Harvard).
Arizona briefly began the game in a two-three matchup zone that had freshman Kaleb Tarczewski anchoring the paint with the rest of the starting lineup (Mark Lyons, Kevin Parrom, Nick Johnson, and Solomon Hill) spread out on the perimeter. The zone segued into a soft man-to-man with the center hanging in the paint when Clark beat Tarczewski exploited the freshman’s tendency to hang back in the paint, sinking two jumpers from the top of the key. Tarczewski and the Wildcats’ other big men—freshmen Grant Jerrett and Brandon Ashley—close out well on three-point shooters and have the length to contest shots even when they initially look out of position.
Against the Crimson, look for Miller to use Tarczewski to handle sophomore big Jonah Travis, Steve Moundou-Missi, and Kenyatta Smith one-on-one in a similar strategy. At times, the former Xavier coach put in Jerrett or Ashley with Tarczewski to create two-big lineups that yielded large rebounding advantages against the smaller Bruins (Arizona finished with a 42-15 rebounding margin, 12-2 on the offensive boards). The Wildcats don’t try to get out on fast breaks, crashing the defensive boards. With the Crimson not being a particularly good offensive rebounding team—to put it lightly—Arizona will have the advantage on the defensive boards. On offense, Arizona crashes the offensive boards hard and reaped the benefits against the Bruins, who look to get out on fast breaks. Harvard is an inferior rebounding team to Belmont but leaves everyone home in an attempt to improve its rebounding percentages. The battle between the trio of Wildcat bigs and the Harvard front line will have a large impact on Saturday’s game.
Arizona excels at spacing the floor when it is on offense. Although it is not a dominant three point shooting team, the Wildcats send Johnson (38 percent from deep) and Parrom (40 percent) to the corners on most possessions. Johnson, who is a better ball handler, will curl around and handle the ball at the top of the key sometimes, in which case Solomon Hill slides back into the void he created on the wing. By keeping its wings isolated around the arc, Arizona gives its big men a large amount of space inside to operate in. Belmont was content to try and win a one-on-one battle down low and was burned time and time again by Tarczewski (five for five shooting, 12 points). Jerrett and Ashley also consistently were able to beat the Belmont big men inside, even when the Bruins shifted to a zone in the second half to counter how the Wildcat guards drew help defense away from the basket.
Drawing the opponent’s big men to the perimeter also allows Lyons and Johnson to beat defenders one-on-one and get to the hoop. Both are good finishers in the lane and possess the athleticism to create space in the air and jump through and around defenders. The Wildcat big will sometime screen off his man to give the guards more room to operate as they drive, making the task of opponent shot blockers that much more difficult. Johnson and Lyons also are good passers out of traffic, preventing defenses from collapsing on them. In particular, Johnson excels at finding the open man in the corner. All five of his assists were on three-point shots and he found Hill for each of his three-pointers.
In the second half, the Wildcats ratcheted up the offense behind a steady stream of three-pointers that opened up avenues inside for drives. After scoring just 32 points in the first half, Arizona put up 49 in the second half. Much of that had to do with improved shooting from the Wildcats (they made five threes in the period) that stretched the floor. The Bruins initially came out in a two-three zone intended to counter the presence of Tarczewski inside. Not only did the Massachusetts native continue to dominate inside, but it opened up opportunities for Hill and Parrom on the outside.
The Bruins was also much improved on offense in the second half. Belmont scored 44 points after just 20 in the first half, launching threes from every part of the court. Although the final box score reflects just a 29.6 percent conversion rate from behind the arc, I counted at least six open looks that the Bruins could not convert. Three of those came from the corner, the most efficient area on the floor. Both are good signs for the Crimson, who specialize in the three and who love to spot up junior Laurent Rivard in the corner. For Smith Moundou-Missi, who employ the same strategy in the Ivy League, it will be key to shade out and deny Lyons avenues to the basket. Neither big man has seen a guard with Lyons’ athleticism.
For the Crimson, Arizona’s play against Belmont has a lot of important lessons. If the Wildcats can shoot more than 50 percent from beyond the arc, Harvard will have a very hard time stopping the Wildcats on the perimeter. It will be crucial for the Crimson that Smith be able to stay in the game and avoid foul trouble while providing good defense on Tarczewski. With McDonald’s All-Americans coming off the bench on the interior, Arizona boasts interior depth that the Lobos did not have beyond Alex Kirk. The Crimson perimeter defenders also must be accountable off the dribble. With Johnson’s ability to penetrate the lane, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker will run into major trouble if he tries to put either Christian Webster or Rivard—neither of which are ace perimeter defenders—on him. Shutting down Johnson is the key to shutting down this Arizona offense, as he is both their best creator and shooter.
On offense, there are good takeaways for Amaker’s squad. The Wildcats did not defend the corner three, a Crimson specialty, very well. Lyons is not a guard that will dominate Chambers physically, and he is a much easier mark than the six-four Williams. Although Miller will likely play offense-defense switches in putting Johnson on Rivard or Webster and sticking Parrom on Saunders, none of the Wildcat guards could stop Belmont guards Ian Clark or Karrom Johnson from getting into the lane consistently in the second half. The big men for the Wildcats are impressive defenders, however, and can contest shots out to the three-point line. Screening and getting them away from the basket will be key for Amaker and his squad.
The result is a bit of a mixed message. Belmont’s loss to Arizona wasn’t as bad as the score indicated; a couple made threes could have completely changed the game for the Bruins. Lyons enjoyed an unusually efficient game from the field. In the win, the Wildcats still had 15 turnovers. The Crimson, led by Saunders, has quick hands and can exploit this, especially in the open court. Harvard will be facing an uphill battle to take down the Wildcats, but that’s been the case all year. If they can contain Johnson and Tarczewski, the Crimson has a good chance to defy the odds yet again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 23, 2013, at 11:00 p.m.
SALT LAKE CITY—Since the start of the 2012-13 season, the motto of the Harvard men’s basketball team has been, “We may not have what we had, but we have enough.”
But when the Crimson met the University of Arizona on Saturday in the third round of the NCAA Tournament, that wasn’t the case.
The Wildcats (27-7) dominated Harvard (20-10) from start to finish, never trailing en route to a 74-51 victory in front of 16,060 fans at EnergySolutions Arena.
“They deserved to win,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said of Arizona, which will take on No. 2 Ohio State in the Sweet Sixteen. “Arizona played an outstanding ballgame.”
After shooting a blistering 52.4 percent from the field in an upset victory over New Mexico Thursday, the Crimson struggled to find the bottom of the net against the Wildcats’ pressuring defense.
The Crimson shot just 27.6 percent from the floor—a season low—and connected on just five of 18 attempts from deep.
“Disappointing for us that we didn’t play better,” Amaker said. “I think we’ve shown that we’ve been a better team than we displayed this afternoon.”
Sophomore Wesley Saunders, who led the Ivy League in scoring, was held to single-digit scoring for the first time this season. The wing finished with eight points after missing 10 of 11 shots from the field.
“We tried to drive and kick and penetrate and we needed open shots from the perimeter,” Amaker said. “We didn’t have either of those helping us. One usually helps the other, and neither were working for us.”
On the other end, Harvard struggled to contain Wildcat point guard Mark Lyons and the rest of the Arizona offense. Lyons finished with a season-high 27 points on 12-of-17 shooting.
As a team, the Wildcats shot 55.1 percent from the field and connected on nine of 15 three-pointers. The latter mark ties a record for best three-point shooting in an NCAA Tournament game with a minimum of 10 attempts.
Arizona opened the game on a 17-2 run as the Crimson missed its first 12 shots from the field. The Wildcats went into the break up 18, and extended their lead to as many as 25 in the second half.
“They pounced right on us from the beginning,” said co-captain Christian Webster, who combined with junior Laurent Rivard to shoot three of 13 from deep. “I think it took us by surprise how hard they played, how physical they were, and like Siyani [Chambers] said, their length and size and speed. From there it was just an uphill battle.”
Sophomore center Kenyatta Smith led the Crimson with 10 points, five rebounds, three steals, and one block.
Rivard, who connected on five of nine triples in the Crimson’s win over New Mexico, finished with just three points after missing five of six three-point attempts.
“They locked down on him,” Amaker said. “You could see it was a point of emphasis for their team to not lose him.”
While Rivard struggled to get open looks, Lyons seemed to get his shot at will. The Xavier transfer made three of six from beyond the arc and finished with 16 points in the second half alone on seven-of-eight attempts.
“When the chips are down, end of games, big games, he’s ready,” Arizona coach Sean Miller said. “He doesn’t give you that nervous energy; he gives you just the opposite, a confidence that I believe has become contagious on our team.”
Early on though, it was senior Solomon Hill who was getting it done for the Wildcats. At 6’7”, 220 lbs. with the ability to stroke from deep, Hill presented a tremendous challenge for the undersized Crimson heading into the contest. Hill exploited his matchup in the early going, sticking a fadeaway jumper over Saunders on the Wildcats’ opening possession.
With 8:06 remaining in the period, Hill had already posted 10 points to the Crimson’s nine. Hill’s transition dunk put his team ahead, 30-9.
After missing its first 12 attempts, Harvard’s first field goal came off a Chambers three-pointer with 12:16 to play in the first period and the Crimson trailing 17-2. But Harvard was not without opportunities. The Crimson had a number of open looks from deep early in the contest, but started the game zero of four from beyond the arc.
“We should have made ‘em,” Webster said. “If we would have made the shots, maybe the game would have been different.”
Things did not improve for the Crimson following Chambers’ make, as Harvard went into the break shooting one of seven from deep and down 18, 40-22.
Coming out of the half, the Crimson made a slight push. Smith finished a pass from Saunders, and Webster stuck a triple from the top of the key off a pass from Chambers to make it a 15-point game with 18:44 to go.
Arizona coach Sean Miller had seen enough, calling a 30-second timeout.
Lyons responded with seven straight points for the Wildcats, and Arizona was back up by 20 before the 12-minute mark.
“I really believe that once we came out of that timeout we regained our composure a little bit, not that we were rattled, but we regained that hard play and concentration on defense.”
Arizona extended its lead to as many as 25 before winning by 23.
Despite the lopsided outcome, the Crimson leaves Salt Lake City with few regrets, having won its first ever postseason contest and its third straight Ivy League title.
“We accomplished all our goals this year,” said Webster, the Crimson’s lone senior. “We have nothing to be ashamed of. We’re going out with our head held high, and that’s what really matters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This time last year, the Arizona men’s basketball team had just fallen to Bucknell on its home court in the first round of the NIT.
In its first year in the Pac 12, the Wildcats were defeated by Colorado in the finals of the conference tournament, causing Arizona to miss an NCAA tournament bid after making the Elite Eight in 2011.
“It was kind of a burden off our back, fighting with the demons of  the season,” senior forward Solomon Hill said. “A couple of guys left the program after that year.”
Under former Xavier coach Sean Miller—now in his fourth year with Arizona—the Wildcats looked to rebuild. With a highly touted freshman recruiting class that included a consensus top 10 newcomer in seven-foot center Kaleb Tarczewki, Arizona turned the page.
“Focusing on the next year and being able to have a great recruiting class of big time freshmen, [we were able to] finish up the year and school and get ready for the summer,” Hill said.
As the Wildcats looked to make a fresh start in the 2012-2013 season, they got help from outside the freshman class. Senior guard Mark Lyons—who played under Miller at Xavier—transferred to Arizona over the summer. As a Wildcat, Lyon—who leads the team with 15 points per game—was asked to transition from a combo guard into a true point guard.
After starting the season ranked No. 12 in the AP preseason poll, the Wildcats came out hot and won their first 14 games, quickly moving into the No. 3 spot in the rankings by week seven. Lyons led the way, putting up the team high in points in seven of the 14 contests.
During the opening of the Wildcats season, the trio of freshman bigs—Tarczewski, Brandon Ashley, and Grant Jerrett—began to shine. Ashley notched two double-doubles during the win streak, and Jerrett scored in double digits three times.
“If you think about the experience [the three] have gotten from start to finish, they are no longer freshmen, and you can see that out there,” Miller said. “They’re more sure of themselves on offense and defense. Like any team, our team is so much better and difficult to beat when those three guys are playing well.”
But just when it seemed like Arizona couldn’t lose, it met Oregon on Jan. 10. The Ducks scored the first 11 points of the game and didn’t look back, and a late push by the Wildcats couldn’t get the job done in Eugene.
The former darlings of the Pac 12 struggled as they got deep into the heart of conference play, going 5-5 to close out the season. Arizona finished second in the Pac 12 after falling to UCLA—a team which beat the Wildcats twice during the season.
“The quality of our conference from top to bottom is the best it’s been since I’ve been the coach at Arizona,” Miller said. “I think anytime you’re playing on the road and playing these teams at the end of February and early March, these are huge games and you could play really well and not win them.”
Three of the Wildcats’ five losses came on the road, including in back-to-back contests at USC and UCLA. Arizona’s struggled defensively—especially on the perimeter—and allowed the Trojans to shoot over 60 percent from the field.
“From a defensive perspective, there are times when we have been dominant, times when we have been really good,” Miller said. “Unfortunately for us, it’s just a half or just a game where our defense left us. When it has, it has hurt us in the win-loss column.”
After snapping a four-game win streak with consecutive losses to California and Colorado—its first back-to-back defeats of the season—Miller decided to shake up his starting lineup and replace Ashley with senior sixth-man Kevin Parrom.
Parrom had started one game previously in the season and saw around 20 minutes of playing time. When he was given the start in mid-February, the senior was averaging 8.0 points per game, and—after starting the remaining eight contests—brought his scoring up to 8.3 points per game.
After being rocked by personal tragedy in 2011, Parrom finished the 2012-13 season shooting 49 percent from the field—including 40 percent from three. Two years ago, the senior lost his mother and grandmother and suffered a gunshot wound when visiting his home in the Bronx.
“I believe as you get closer to the end that the players on your team that are your guiding force are your seniors,” Miller said. “They have the most to gain, the most to lose… When you have someone like [Parrom] on your team, it gives your team a lot of character and a lot of courage, and it’s these moments that you appreciate him.”
Coming into the NCAA tournament, the Wildcats seem to have turned their defensive struggles around—at least in their first round matchup against Belmont. With a 23-point contribution from Lyons, Arizona held the Bruins to 30 percent shooting from the arc in an 81-64 blowout to advance to face No. 14 Harvard, where the Wildcats will look to extend their tournament push.
“Nobody wants the season to end, in large part because of Kevin Parrom, Solomon Hill, and Mark Lyons,” Miller said. “Those guys have represented Arizona in a first class manner, and they’re great kids.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SALT LAKE CITY—History will call it a blowout.
On Saturday afternoon, Harvard fell, 74-51, in its worst offensive showing of the season in front of an arena full of Arizona fans chanting “Sweet Sixteen” as they watched their team move on past the third round of the NCAA tournament.
The Wildcats put on an offensive clinic and were ice on the defensive end, holding the Crimson’s two top scorers from the previous round—junior co-captain Laurent Rivard and sophomore forward Wesley Saunders—to 2-of-17 shooting.
For most college basketball programs, the loss would have been a setback. For the Harvard men’s basketball team, it was just another step in the right direction.
Picked to finish second in the Ivy League preseason poll after losing senior co-captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, the Crimson took the country by surprise by upsetting No. 3 seeded New Mexico in the second round of the tournament to advance.
Harvard’s victory was its first in the Big Dance, and for a couple days the team captured the hearts and minds of basketball fans across the country. The Crimson graced the cover of ESPN.com and other national news outlets, and memes of the Harvard band cropped up online.
“Nerd” jokes abounded, but the media marveled at how Crimson coach Tommy Amaker was able to build a competitive team given his lack of scholarships and comparatively low funding.
The Harvard student body—not normally known for its interest in school sports teams—took to social media and the Cambridge bars to follow their team’s run at history.
Though the Cinderella story wouldn’t last, the consequences are monumental for Amaker and the program.
Hired as the head coach in 2007, it took Amaker two season of posting losing conference records to get the team back on track. Since then, every year has been a milestone. In 2009, the Crimson defeated No. 17 Boston College in its first ever win over a nationally ranked team. In 2010, the team posted its winningest record in history and went to the CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament. In 2011, Harvard won a share of the Ivy title and the following year won it outright, making the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946.
Amaker’s recruiting has been his major building block. Using the academic brand of Harvard to appeal to players, he has talked about how he lets the program and its opportunities speak for itself.
And it seems to be working. In his first season at the helm, Amaker recruited Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, who captained the team to its first ever tournament berth. Since then he has landed three-star recruits like sophomore forward Kenyatta Smith and locked up the program’s first top-100 recruit in Zena Edosomwan, who will join the team next year.
The team’s only senior—co-captain Christian Webster—joined the team early in Amaker’s era, before Harvard had made tangible progress. Retiring as the Crimson’s winningest player in program history, the guard believes it will only continue to improve.
“Looking at where the program came from, it’s just rising,” said Webster after Saturday’s loss. “It’s going to take a lot of hard work, and that’s what we’ve been putting in so far. We’ll get there.”
As Webster steps out of the spotlight, he passes the torch to a talented young roster led by freshman point guard Siyani Chambers. Chambers echoed Webster’s pride in the program after the game, saying that the loss showed him that Harvard belongs in the tournament and can be competitive with teams like the Wildcats—nationally ranked as high as No. 4 this season.
Listening to Amaker talk about the program that he has built, he seems restless—like each milestone isn’t enough. He credits his players with believing in his vision and working hard to get where they are, but he is eager to move forward and take the next step.
“Every year is a new year,” Amaker said. “We hope to continue to keep scratching and grinding. With the kind of kids we have, I suspect that’s going to happen. They have worked hard for us all year, and the fact that they’re disappointed and dejected and down about the way we have ended this is an indication of how hard I think they will work and put in the effort so we can get better.”
Having captured the attention of the student body and sports fans everywhere, and with the prospect of adding Curry and Casey to its talented young roster, there’s no telling what the Crimson will be able to do in the years to come.
