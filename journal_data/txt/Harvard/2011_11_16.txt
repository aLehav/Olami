After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, Donald Glover was not a name anyone would associate with rap. A talented comedic writer and actor, of course, but not a rapper. He’s best known for his work with the sketch comedy group “Derrick Comedy” and shows like “30 Rock,” “The Daily Show,” and “Community.” While all of this was going on, he was quietly producing and recording music since 2008 under the nom-de-rap “Childish Gambino.”
Childish Gambino’s latest release, “Camp,” showcases Glover’s genuine talent for songwriting and rapping. Glover has long dealt with questions about the legitimacy of his rap career, as with most actors seeking to begin recording music. While on earlier mix tapes Glover seemed to have been bogged down by these questions, “Camp” continues the evolution demonstrated in his last two releases, “Culdesac” and “EP.” On “Camp” as on those two albums, he moves past these superficial insecurities and delivers a stunning and mature album. “Camp” explores the same issues of identity present in Glover’s earlier releases, but he deals with identity in a much more developed way by singing about race, his childhood, and loneliness.
While Glover writes and sings about himself extensively on “Camp,” it never feels self-adulating or compensatory. Rather, his storytelling feels sincere and heartfelt in a way mainstream rap rarely does. For instance, on opening track “Outside,” Glover raps at length about childhood and life in the projects. He talks specifically about his cousin: “He lookin’ at me now, like / ‘Why you so fuckin’ lucky?’ / I had a father too, / But he ain’t around so I’mma take it out on you.’” There are no cheesy synth notes or horns; the beat is tastefully produced, with piano to underscore the soft parts and sparing use of bass throughout—a significant departure from the assaultive, bass n’ synth–heavy production dominating hip-hop.
“Camp” is built around a loose narrative about Glover attending summer camp and meeting a girl. “Kids (Keep Up)” is a surprisingly tender reflection on the differences between childhood affections and adult relationships. Glover sings as a naïve kid during the hooks, “If we were kids, I’d want to give you everything that you would want,” and raps as a jaded adult during the verses, “There any breakage in that Trojan? / She see what she wanna see, so I make her take plan B in front of me.” It also features quite a bit of Glover’s singing, which, like his rapping, is improbably successful. His voice is soft and floats to reach high notes with ease, and contrasts with his sharp, staccato flow during the verses. This tension mirrors the dichotomy between the tone of the lyrics in the hook and verses.
Not every track on “Camp” is similarly pensive. “Bonfire” is the first single off the record, and with good reason. It trades the frank self-reflection of the other tracks for aggressive, straightforward rap. He doesn’t sing or have any orchestral arrangements to distract from his rap, and this sparseness is justified by the sheer strength of his lyrics. He lets loose with his lethal, engagingly complex wordplay. He raps, “I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA,” and “Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune.” The track is reminiscent of Kanye West’s “POWER,” with the choir repeating notes ominously over chords from a distorted electric guitar. What Glover adds is his precise and hard-hitting flow, as he delivers line after line without losing an ounce of energy during the song.
On “Camp,” Donald Glover shows that Childish Gambino is not a puerile side project or cheap attempt to cash in on his fame. On the record, Glover sings on almost every track and steps away from the usual clichés of hip-hop in order to share some real pain and sentiment. The album closes with “That Power,” which begins conventionally enough, with about three minutes of standard rap and hooks. Then it shifts to a four-minute monologue about Glover leaving the titular summer camp. He makes himself emotionally vulnerable, both to the girl he is addressing in the monologue and to the listener. His speech concludes an album filled with the sort of mature self-examination painfully absent from most albums of any genre. He says in the outro, “I told you something. It was just for you, and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middleman, make it all for everybody, always...But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you. Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose.” Donald Glover ends the album on a bittersweet note, but one that affirms—like his work in any medium—his driving passion.

At some point in the past year Florence + the Machine transitioned from its status as a hype-heavy act of questionable talent to that of a deeply affecting musical powerhouse. Florence + the Machine—which really is just a stage name for lead vocalist and songwriter Florence Welch—impressed the public with her first album, “Lungs,” which featured cute punk hits like “Kiss with a Fist” reminiscent of Avril Lavigne’s similar girly-punk phase. With “Ceremonials,” Welch has left behind that almost juvenile demeanor and come into her own unique style that showcases both her fabulous voice and the lyrically ingenious, beat-heavy music that backs her vocals.  “Ceremonials” is a deeply compelling album, a synthesis of extremely enjoyable pop forms and profound poetic meaning.
Even without the music, the lyrics of “Ceremonials” would retain their power. “Shake It Out,” for instance, relates the dark story of a Welch who is plagued by metaphorical demons. At the bridge of the song, she sings: “I’m damned if I do and I’m damned if I don’t / So here’s to drinks in the dark at the end of my road,” and she evokes a strangely alluring image of drinking to her own demise. To emphasize the ideal of living without regret even further, she belts in the chorus, “And it’s hard to dance with a devil on your back / So shake him off” Even in ecstatic pop choruses, she maintains her dour lyrical themes.
The equivalent musical pinnacle is found on “Lover to Lover,” which starts with a peppy piano progression that recasts Welch’s tremulous vocals as those of a 1960s Motown diva. For a singer with such a distinct voice, Welch is surprisingly versatile, as demonstrated by her bold channeling of old soul singers.  Somehow,  it all works, even despite Florence + the Machine’s indie categorization. The group defies genre expectations to stunning effect as they delve into the depths of musical history and pull off danceable Motown hits as well as pensive, swelling, and unhinged indie rock.
Though a Motown throwback was unexpected, perhaps the most surprising song on the album is “Breaking Down.” Where the album deals in large themes and larger sounds, “Breaking Down” is shockingly intimate. Welch’s vocals make their first appearance after an orchestral introduction reminiscent of Arcade Fire. She uses a tape slap reverb effect that echoes intimately over the sound of violins. Thanks in part to the reverb effect, the slow strings, and her ominously hushed vocals, she sounds like a female Wyn Butler. Every twist and turn her voice makes is amplified, and her exaggerated imperfections lend her the vulnerability suggested by the song’s title.  As the track progresses, Welch is backed by a choir that serves as a perfect metaphor for support—the other voices back her own quavering voice as she slowly “breaks down.”
If there are any disappointing moments to this album, they appear in Welch’s final track, “Leave My Body.” The track opens with ghostly atmospherics and a off-pitch, breathy synthesizer that unfortunately sounds like a mediocre performance at a fifth-grade flute recital. Perhaps the disjointed sound of the mystery instrument is supposed to remind us of a disjointed body and soul, as suggested by the title of “Leave My Body.” However, such symbolism fails, as the flute is too distracting to allow for any deep thought. While she displays admirable constraint throughout the record, it’s clear that her cosmic musical ambitions tend towards indulgence if left unchecked.
Overall, the album is true to the promise in “Shake it Out” of freeing listeners of regret and allowing for metaphorical demons to be cleansed through dance. Welch is an incredibly gifted and versatile songwriter, and she has created an album both lyrically pleasing, and wildly fun to listen to. Her knack for combining genres of music without losing her unique touch allows her to appeal to a broader base, and to transcend limitations typically associated with indie music.

How many musicians does it take to make a successful album? Maybe four if you consider such legends as the Beatles and the Who. Two, if you’re thinking Simon and Garfunkel. But take seven ambitious kids from Wales, call them peasants, slap an exclamation mark at the end, and you have Los Campesinos!, a now critically acclaimed indie rock group that has released three excellent albums between 2008 and 2010. The members themselves are quirky—evidenced by their changing their legal last names to Campesinos!, not kidding—but their angry youth and out-there style has done nothing but contribute to the overall success of the sarcastic and witty lyrics of past tracks. Their fourth album, “Hello Sadness,” manages to capitalize on the high promise of its predecessors’ buoyant footsteps.
With previous albums titled “We Are Beautiful, We Are Doomed” and “Romance is Boring,” “Hello Sadness” continues from the very beginning with the self-deprecating, faux-romantic tones for which the Cardiff-based band is known. “By Your Hand” kicks off the album with descriptions of a complicated, twisted relationship with the “cruel mistress” fate. Apparently a bitch at heart, she creates an enticing sense of security only to eventually “vomit down [your] rental tux“ and screw up your life. Lead singer Gareth Campesinos! belts out sardonic lyrics with the occasional assistance of his mates, thus creating a dynamic shift between despair and an echoing, dissatisfied crowd. Lighthearted, airy keyboard and softly rumbling drums clash with the cynical lyrics and highlights the complexity of the relationship. Witty and at times weird, this first track gives a nice preview of what is to come.
At its core, “Hello Sadness” is a bit manic-depressive. In one track, upbeat instrumentals and choral vocals simulate the experience of a caffeine overdose. Then, in a dramatic shift, the high is gone, the crash is hard, and the next song’s tone is more melancholic. On “The Black Bird, the Dark Slope,” charged electric guitar riffs join quick-paced drums and sharp, intermittent bursts of violin. All the while, lyrics such as “This black bird wants to rip me limb from limb” remind us that the song is not as happy-go-lucky as the instruments suggest. On the other end of the spectrum, “Light Leaves, Dark Sees Pt. II,” is perhaps the album’s best combination of solemn musical undertones and disenchanted lyrics. Hypnotic and understated, the breakneck speed of earlier tracks is replaced by a pleasantly numbing experience evoked by softly rising keyboard, carefully spaced high-pitched strums of guitar, and low rolling drums. This dreaminess  is heightened by the echoes of female vocals but becomes even more rhythmically soothing when the lyrics “As the light leaves, the dark sees” repeat over and over again, tapering off into a relaxed, somber end to song and album.
Los Campesinos! writes lyrics that stay in a happy cloud of angst and sarcasm while this emotional tug of war is enacted by the instrumentals. By remaining static in tone and allowing the instrumental bodies to create a whimsically dynamic setting, the lyrics reach higher, more poignant levels. There are times when some lyrics delve so far into the bizarre that they seem like unnecessary additions to an otherwise solid album. But these instances are so few and far between, and so heavily outweighed by lyrics such as “Your tongue the tide, your lips the shore, I am the jetsam overboard / goodbye courage,” that the low-grade choices are easily ignored.
Ellen, Gareth, Neil, Tom, Kim, Rob, and Jason—these are the faces of Los Campesinos!, the parents of the multifaceted yet logically grounded “Hello Sadness.” These are musicians who know their style, know their sound, and know how to manipulate both so that neither becomes tired and old. Not too depressing, and definitely not at all bubbly, “Hello Sadness” is a continuation of the group’s dark, anti-romantic view of life and a great release from a group that is as skilled as it is large.

It has taken almost two months for the Occupy movement to hit Harvard. Since Wednesday night, protesters have occupied tents outside of University Hall, while Harvard University Police Department officers have occupied the gates of the Yard to limit the crowd to Harvard affiliates only. The movement as a whole has occupied the minds of students across campus.
Leaving aside the inconvenience of having to show identification to enter the Yard—because most good protest movements create a degree of inconvenience in gaining recognition, and there is no reason to fault Occupy Harvard for garnering attention—the Harvard-specific manifestation of the Occupy movement is problematic in a number of ways. To see these dangers, it is important to understand how Occupy Harvard departs from the overarching Occupy movement from which it seemingly arose.
For all of the pitfalls associated with Occupy’s perpetuation of class division, the movement’s validity is rooted in genuine frustrations. The American economy is struggling, and these struggles do reflect structural problems. There does indeed exist a college-educated but burdened middle class that has been buried by the recession and its aftermath, alongside a lower class fighting to pull itself up by the bootstraps in a system that does not do the working class many favors. While the Occupy movement, when viewed holistically, is misguided, lacks concrete solutions, and is startlingly quick to slap one percent of Americans as perpetrators of financial iniquities, it does reflect the fears and concerns of a group looking for something better than what they have.
But instead of being a unified chorus of voices challenging a flawed system, Occupy Harvard presents itself as a self-righteous band of students biting the hand that will forever feed them. Can the privileged protest? Sure they can—I was humored to see a video clip of one Kanye West, who certainly isn’t “drug dealing just to get by” anymore, strolling around Zucotti Park a few weeks ago.
Yet Occupy Harvard is a disturbing adaptation of the Occupy movement in that it seeks to trivialize the meaning of a Harvard education. In protesting Harvard as an instrument of elite financial oppression, Harvard students uncouthly slander the source of their financial aid, their educational experiences, and—most importantly—the abundant opportunities this institution provides them.
For better or worse, Harvard students did not commit to attending a “university for the 99 percent.” Regardless of one’s concrete place in a tax bracket, a Harvard degree is an avenue to American society’s one percent in that it allows us to achieve almost anything we set our minds to. As students of an elite institution, we have been given the tools to succeed in all walks of life—whether that success is defined in strictly financial terms or not.
In addition to the fact that a Harvard education often cultivates a preexisting abundance of intellectual capital—most of us are pretty smart—this university, more than any other in the world, gives us the capital to chase our dreams. To ask for a Harvard for the 99 percent is to denounce that capital, to devalue a Harvard degree, and to clamor for an institution that isn’t as special as the one we attend.
This is not to suggest that Harvard is not or should not be open to criticism, particularly from students; protest has, over the course of history, been a fuel for positive change. But to lose sight of exactly what you’re protesting, as those camped in the Yard have done, is dangerous because a Harvard for the 99 percent is a Harvard that has lost its luster and has diminished the opportunities it affords to its students.
In that light, we must consider how Occupy Harvard looks to those on the outside looking in. In falsely assuming that they represent the 99 percent, these protesters not only slam the value of this institution but also shame themselves and their classmates as the world watches. Occupy Harvard is content to trash the boundless opportunities a Harvard education offers, while America’s honest-to-goodness 99 percent would snatch up such opportunities in a heartbeat.
This is not a question of making the University look bad. By rejecting the tenets of attending an elite institution, Occupy Harvard protesters only make themselves look bad in the eyes of those watching—chances are, these protesters accepted their invitations to study here because Harvard provides the best chance for them to succeed and achieve their goals. Suddenly, it seems, protesters have taken to occupying tents in Harvard Yard because they no longer foster an appreciation for the beautiful opportunity they’ve been given to occupy a Harvard dorm room.
Meanwhile, the rest of the world looks in through Harvard Yard’s pearly gates, likely wondering what these students—who have been given the ultimate privilege in American education—feel is so brutally unfair. This side of the story disgraces the protesters, their more appreciative peers, and even the Occupy movement as a whole. If the Harvard opportunity does not satisfy the students camped out in the Yard, perhaps they should offer it to people who would truly value the chance to occupy Harvard.

In the past months we’ve heard a lot about the one percent and the 99 percent and, from one set of Harvard-Yale trash talk shirts, the 6.2 percent. I’d like to introduce a new number to the conversation: the five percent.
Those students occupying the Yard criticize the university as a bastion of stratification, enabling the ten percent to become the one percent and the onepercent to become the 0.1 percent. It is undeniable that Harvard has traditionally existed to perpetuate the uppermost class of American society, but in the last half-century it has attempted at least to equalize its admissions process. Through extensive financial aid and increasing disassociation from the prep school pipeline, Harvard has done its best to become a meritocratic institution.
Harvard’s true culpability lies in its complicity in the “brain drain” into finance and consulting, fields that produce very little and in fact leech off of other industries. These jobs are prestigious and lucrative, which explains why they are especially tempting for Ivy League types.
Here is one way that Harvard can solve both problems: abolish tuition as we know it in favor of a garnishment of future wages. This would instantly wipe away Harvard’s (already mistaken) reputation as a prohibitively expensive school available only to a wealthy elite as well as its habit of sending its brightest graduates into professions that revere avarice.
Though Harvard does provide excellent financial aid, tuition costs at private schools are rising at an average of 4.5 percent. The number jumps to 7.9 percent for cash-strapped public universities—numbers that far outpace inflation. The accessibility of private colleges for students with less affluent backgrounds has steadily increased since the passage of the G.I. Bill, but the price of an elite education can be asphyxiating. Obviously, not all schools can offer anywhere near the same kind of aid that Harvard can. Student loans can be a noose around the neck of a young graduate; even bankruptcy cannot eradicate the tens of thousands of dollars of debt that many students acquire. As students desperately try to find jobs that will allow them to pay off their debts, salary begins to supersede other factors like passion or service.
I propose that Harvard abolish tuition as we know it. In its place, students should agree upon matriculation, in a legally binding contract, that they will devote a small share of their future earnings to the University. Presumably, Harvard admits students partially based on expected successes in the real world. This success, in an uncorrupted system, translates into financial success—in fact, the $116,000 that the median Harvard graduate makes midway through his or her career ranks fourth in the world. When you compare that to the $46,000 median salary for all college graduates and keep in mind causation-correlation bias, the Harvard name is worth $70,000 per year, or 60 percent of your future salary.
Say Harvard institutes a system in which, starting at that meaty mid-career point in which the graduate is likely fully financially stable, it garnishes a mere five percent of the graduate’s annual earnings each year until retirement as payment for the graduate’s college experience twenty years prior. Assuming a 40-year-long career and plateaued earnings, this median graduate will pay a reasonable $5,800 per year—totaling at least $116,000 or the inflationary equivalent over the course of the latter half of his or her career. According to Harvard’s own stated data regarding tuition and financial aid, the average student pays the school $35,300 per year, or $141,202 in total. By spreading this burden out over the student’s financially independent future instead of his or her broke undergraduate years, the system becomes much more fair and the burden more manageable without resulting in a large net loss of income for the school.
College-aged students are the demographic least likely to be able to afford a college education. But their decision where to go to school should be theirs and theirs alone. This system would eliminate all the pain and work often associated with making ends meet for tuition bills or the large financial burden imposed on parents for four years.
Some people come to Harvard so they can get a high-paying investment-banking job and get rich; some come to prepare for a career in public service or non-profit work. Why should these groups be expected to pay the same rates? Those who get rich with help from the Harvard name should pay the favor back with a big tuition payment. Those who come here without dollar signs in their eyes, however, should not consider exorbitant tuition to be pushing them into a more lucrative field.
Harvard claims it wants to become less concerned with family background and more focused on ensuring student success in socially responsible fields—let it put its money where its mouth is.

Nicaraguan voters recently reelected Daniel Ortega to be their president, sending him back into office by a landslide. Supporters of his socialist Sandinista party took to the streets of the hemisphere’s second poorest country, cheering and waving red and black Sandinista flags. While the outcome of the election was hardly surprising, it cannot be described as anything but disappointing. As long as Ortega remains in power, Nicaragua’s political system will remain broken.
While this time around Ortega had 62 percent of the vote, last time, in 2005, he squeaked into office with 38 percent. The only reason he was able to do this was a pact with his political nemesis, former president Arnoldo Aleman of the Liberal Party, the traditional alternative to the Sandinistas. Aleman lowered the threshold required to win an election to 35 percent, historically the proportion of the electorate that favors the Sandinistas. The two parties then divided up power in the political institutions between them and allowed judges to be appointed politically. In 2003, Aleman was convicted on corruption charges and given house arrest—“house,” in this case, meaning a luxurious hacienda.
The aforementioned pact is just one example of how shameless Nicaragua’s ruling elite has become. While corruption is commonplace in Latin America, in Nicaragua the practice is conducted openly, by pseudo-legal means. The Nicaraguan constitution expressly prohibits reelection. However, judges on the country’s Supreme Court are allowed to openly express political affiliation. Most of them are Sandinista, and it is no surprise that they ruled in favor of allowing Ortega to run once more. Sometimes, of course, the means for corruption are a little less than pseudo-legal. Three years ago, municipal elections across Nicaragua were widely rigged by the Sandinistas—but who could prevent or oppose this?
During his most recent term, Ortega accomplished essentially nothing constructive. He let the business sector run itself with little interference, despite his socialist rhetoric. Instead, he spent his time giving speeches in praise of Hugo Chavez, which led many to characterize Ortega as little more than a stooge. In exchange for Nicaragua’s diplomatic support, Chavez has pumped over a billion dollars into the Nicaraguan economy, subsidizing services for the poor. Any outside observer, however, can ascertain that this economic strategy is not a strategy at all. Nicaragua can’t continue to live off Venezuela forever; the Venezuelan economy itself is going down the drain. Once the flow of oil dollars from Caracas dries up, Nicaragua will have made no real economic gains—its workforce will be no more educated or productive than before. Ironically, the Sandinistas practically used this as part of their campaign platform. In an act reminiscent of blackmail, they hinted that if another party were elected, Chavez would reconsider his generosity.
While Ortega is little more than a loudmouth, he is a reckless, and potentially dangerous one. Last year, at a moment when his popularity sagged, he sent Nicaraguan troops to occupy the territory of Costa Rica, Nicaragua’s more prosperous neighbor, which lacks an army. Given the animosity between the two countries, his poll numbers immediately jumped. Actions like this demonstrate Ortega’s aggrandized conception of himself. He views Nicaragua as his personal fiefdom. And even as the dancing continues on the streets of Managua, Nicaragua’s voters will one day come to rue their tolerance for corruption.

“We had a mutual friend who was a graduate student—a woman called Ankhi Mukherjee. And Matthew told Ankhi that he thought I was cute. So Ankhi said ‘Oh, I’m going to see this movie’— ‘The Cellular Closet,’ of all things, which is this completely depressing documentary—and she said ‘Oh, well Matthew and I were going to go to it. Maybe we should go together, all three of us!’
It became pretty clear that I was being set up on a date. So we went to see this ‘Cellular Closet,’ and then Ankhi left!
And a bunch of my friends from college were in town this weekend: ‘Let’s go drink; let’s go drink and have fun!’ And I was like ‘I’m on this date with this guy.’ And they were like “bring him along!’
So this will be a real test about what he thinks of me. I remember we went out to this bar—three of my friends, Matthew, and I. And Matthew entertained the pants off of us all.
And I remember when Matthew went to the bathroom: ‘Oh my God you’re on a date! We’re so sorry we broke this up!’ ‘I told you this was a date.’ ‘Oh, we didn’t know! He’s awesome you should totally date him he’s really really nice.’
So that was our first date.
And we had these intense, passionate conversations about ridiculous things like Judith Butler and theory and philosophy and politics. I felt deeply connected to him as, as a soulmate. I just remember on one of our first dates we had this three-hour conversation about all these ideas and things like that, and it was just so thrilling and exciting.
He’s in love with the 19th century. I pretend to understand half of what it is that he talks about—about Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bronte and all this stuff that I don’t really care that much about. Those books are just too long for me to understand. I like plays because they’re shorter.
His parents were divorced. He was kicked out of his dad’s home when he was in high school and lived on his own for a year. Now he has a relationship with his mother and stepfather, who we both love very much. I remember him telling me all these lovely stories about his mother, and how she would buy him Gay Men’s Chorus CDs and things like that. I thought that was really wonderful—to think about growing up in a world where being gay wasn’t a problem. They’ve retired, and now they live in the wine country, which is quite lovely. We were there for the holidays last year. This year they’re coming out to spend the holidays with us, so we’ll still drink wine, but it’ll be much colder.
We’ve never collaborated on something together. We do joke a bit every now and then that we’re going to write a play about our experience at Harvard after we leave this place. We can’t write the play and still maintain our jobs.”

“I first met Ken in graduate school, at Rutgers University. I saw him for the first time in a graduate course on Foucault. And he hates when I say this because he claims my memory is faulty, but I remember him wearing cutoff shorts. He claims he never owned a pair of cutoff shorts, and that I’m misremembering.
I didn’t have a car in those days, so I would walk across the river to the town where I lived from New Brunswick. It was a really long walk up a hill, and at one point, Ken was driving by and saw me walking and stopped, and asked if he could give me a lift.
I said, ‘Oh, thank you!’ So he gave me a lift, but instead of driving me home, he dropped me off halfway because it was more convenient for him, which really annoyed me at the time. That was the first time we spoke.
But I’ve never gotten along with a person so quickly, so soon after meeting the person. We just instantly became really good friends. It was odd. I don’t exactly know why; you can’t really explain that.
He was living with a frightening roommate in a frightening apartment that had no insulation, and so it was really cold. As soon as the winter weather started up, it was unbearable to be there, and my place was nicer, and I had no roommate, and it was insulated, so that’s basically why he moved in.
I’ve met his family a few times in the 15 years we’ve been together. I think Ken thinks it’s 16, and it’s 15. At any rate, what’s really odd is that he’s the only person in his family who doesn’t have a heavy Jersey accent. It’s because he spent his childhood not listening to them. Every rare once in a while he’ll say something with a Jersey accent. But it’s one word, and it’s usually ironic.
He’s an entertainer, essentially. He writes for audiences who want to be entertained. He is very good about prodding me into writing in a more accessible way, to please people, to delight people. And I think that conversely, I’m really good about asking certain pointed questions, questions he sometimes doesn’t like to hear because they’re too academic, maybe. But they get him to think about his work more critically, so there’s a sort of symbiotic relationship between the artistic and the academic that works for us, I think.
I love all of his work. Some of his plays are just completely hilarious, but the hilarity is interwoven with philosophical profundity that is very appealing to me—the mixture of highbrow ideas and lowbrow humor. I love not only witnessing his plays, but also witnessing the audience witnessing his plays.
We were briefly kidnapped by a taxi driver who ended up taking us on a very lengthy tour of Palestine. Though we didn’t want one. It was supposed to be a five-minute taxi ride, and it took five hours by the time it was through. We ended up giving him all of our money so he would take us back where we needed to be. That was a little bit scary, although it was also kind of fun.
I guess the thing that makes our relationship work is that he really is my favorite person in the world. I just enjoy his company more than anyone else’s company. If you want to have a relationship that works, find your favorite person, the person who never bores you, the person who always makes you laugh. That’s the answer.”

Members of the Harvard community are offered this week an intimate look into the life of the President of the United States, Barack Obama—or as Harvard Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree likes to call him, Barry.
“I am glad to have the chance to talk about the president and my friend,” said Ogletree, in the first of three lectures he will be giving on the current president’s life.
Ogletree, who taught Obama in law school, covered topics as diverse as the origin of Obama’s name to the president’s search for religion.
He told stories of Number 44’s childhood in Hawaii and his later years in college and law school.
“Obama was a combination of wit, organization, and luck,” Ogletree explained.
“One of his shortcomings is that he believed then, as he believes now, that he could bring everyone together.”
Race was a recurring theme of the professor’s talk.
Ogletree commented on Obama’s election as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review.
“It changed his life, and in dramatic ways,” said Ogletree.
“He understood the conundrum of race.”
Ogletree also talked about mentoring Obama, and told a story of when Obama asked Ogletree for advice on what to do after graduating from Harvard Law School.
Ogletree said the young law student asked him whether he could make a real difference.
“I said: Barack, yes you can. He never did give me credit for that phrase,” Ogletree joked.
Ogletree also addressed some of the conspiracies surrounding Obama’s former and current life.
“Barack Obama was in fact born August 4, 1961, in Hawaii,” Ogletree explained.
“We have [Donald] Trump to thank for that.”
Ogletree will continue his lecture series on Obama today and tomorrow in the Thompson Room at the Barker Center.
In the next two talks, he will focus on Obama’s relationship with race and religion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chandrika Kumaratunga, the former president of Sri Lanka, painted a sobering picture of an island nation recovering from civil war during a talk at CGIS yesterday.
Kumaratunga, who led Sri Lanka from 1994 to 2005, described her administration’s unsuccessful attempts to resolve through peaceful negotiations the long-standing conflict between Sri Lanka’s majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil populations.
Sri Lanka’s first female president attributed the challenge in part to a “mentality of siege” ­that has become entrenched in the psyche of the Sri Lankan people.
“For 2000 years we were a very strong nation ... but we underwent nearly 500 years of Western colonial rule and were completely subjugated for 450 years,” she said.
This, she argued, helps explain why war, not peace, has held the day.
Identity politics has long been the bedrock of political conflict in Sri Lanka, a nation of 20 million located in the waters off India’s southeastern coast.
Confronting this identity crisis “would require that we manage existing diversity,” Kumaratunga said, “and redirect the richness of that diversity towards positive change.”
Kumaratunga also addressed the failures of previous Sri Lankan administrations.
One “major mistake” that exacerbated identity politics was the now-defunct Sinhala Only Act, which recognized the Sinhalese tongue as the country’s sole official language.
This created a major setback for Tamils and other minority groups seeking equal opportunity in jobs and education, she said.
“We brought all kinds of rules that made it more difficult for the Tamils to get into schools,” said Kumaratunga.
She concluded her talk by discussing the challenges faced by the Sri Lankan people since their civil war ended in 2009.
“The people are fatigués, as they say in French ... fatigued,” she explained.
“The leadership will have to come from fresh, new people.”
At the end of her talk, one audience member asked what American students can learn from Sri Lanka’s history of political conflict.
“They can learn how paradise was lost,” Kumaratunga lamented.
The former president’s lecture was sponsored by the Harvard International Negotiation Program, the Global Institute of Health, the South Asian Initiative, and the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School.

With side servings of erotic cupcakes, student organization Sexual Health Education & Advocacy throughout Harvard College (SHEATH) will coordinate the first annual Sex Week at Harvard College. The event, which will take place the week of March 25, 2012, will provide an opportunity for campus discussions on sex and sexuality.
SHEATH, founded earlier this year, will collaborate with other Harvard organizations and offices to sponsor individual seminars and workshops during the week, delving into topics ranging from the hook-up culture of college to sexual communication.
“Our role is connecting groups that are already doing amazing work on campus and making sure they have a platform and the ability to work in conjunction with other groups,” said Samantha A. Meier ’12, co-founder of SHEATH. “This isn’t just our vision for Sex Week.”
Meier said that an environment that fosters open discussion about sex is necessary for an individual’s sexual wellbeing.
Sarah A. Rankin, Harvard’s director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, said this open discussion should include topics such as honest communication, enthusiastic consent, and self-reflection.
Abby P. Sun ’13, the other SHEATH co-founder, previously organized the annual female orgasm seminar in her role as co-president of the Radcliffe Union of Students.
“[The orgasm seminar] was packed, and we realized that the space available in the auditoriums is nowhere near the demand for students who want to attend events like that,” Sun said.
SHEATH’s announcement of Sex Week at Harvard coincided with Yale’s decision to strip Sex Week at Yale of the university’s name last Thursday­. The New Haven event is now called Sex Week 2012.
But organizers of Sex Week at Harvard note that Yale’s Sex Week is not the only example of such an event. For example, Brown has a well-established and well-received Sex Week. Sun and Meier have been in touch with the organizers of Sex Week at both universities and plan to use and improve upon their experiences.
“There are things that Sex Week at Yale does really well, there are also things that Sex Week at Yale could do better,” Meier said. “We’re interested in providing programming that Harvard students are going to like and that will serve as a launching pad for more discussion.”
SHEATH is still accepting applications from student groups to sponsor, co-sponsor, or participate in Sex Week events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sophomores must declare their concentrations by today, so they have probably scrolled at least once or twice through the list of 46 official Harvard College concentrations. But they won’t see on that list a host of subjects their peers have studied—concentrations like Understanding Terrorism, Neuroeconomics, Silk Road Studies, and even the esoteric field of Esoteric Studies.
Those are all special concentrations, and they help accommodate students with trouble choosing one of Harvard’s existing programs of study.
Some special concentrators combine two distinct fields, like Biology and International Policy, to create an integrated plan of study. But most use the special concentration program as a route to a more conventional major not offered at Harvard, like theater, urban planning, or architecture.
PERMISSION TO BE DIFFERENT
It takes a special kind of student to pick a special concentration.
“We’re looking for an independence of spirit,” says Deborah D. Foster, the director of studies of the special concentrations program. “It takes a fairly mature and clear-minded student.”
To select those students, the program relies on a rigorous application process, which includes a statement of purpose, a proposed plan of study, and a departmental back-up plan in case the special concentration falls through. Applicants must also seek out a faculty advisor and tutorial instructor to endorse their program.
“It takes a lot of persistence, and figuring out how to inspire confidence in your advisors,” says Margaret C. Kerr ’13, a special concentrator in Dramatic Theory and Practice. “When you’re first going through the process, there’s a bit of resistance” from administrators, she says.
Each year, Foster meets with 40 to 50 students who express interest in a special concentration, many of whom eventually choose a pre-existing concentration. Though there is no limit on the number of special concentrators each year, the admissions process is highly selective. Proposals are reviewed by a committee of thirteen professors and lecturers from a variety of disciplines.
“The student must show how their courses relate to each other,” says Foster, who adds that special concentrations must not be pre-professional, in keeping with Harvard’s focus on a liberal arts education.
For better or worse, the institutional hurdles likely lead some students to talk themselves out of crafting their own majors before they even consult with potential advisors. But many find the rigorous process and stringent requirements useful, causing them to more thoughtfully craft their concentrations.
“I think that being a special concentrator can be really difficult, and rightly so, the administration wants to funnel you into one of their mainstream channels,” says Lilla D. Cosgrove ’12, who is concentrating in Urban Studies. “It’s easier for everyone.”
Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14 plans to apply next semester for a special concentration on the role of faith in medical treatment and recovery, despite efforts by some to discourage her from doing so.
“There are those who recommended it and very many people who have dissuaded me, saying that I won’t have the best support system and could easily get lost,” Aung says.
“Is there something special about special concentrators?” Foster asks. “Not necessarily, except that they’re willing to search their mind, go through a rigorous application process, and be their own structure.”
THE CONCENTRATION PETRI DISH
Many special concentrators at Harvard are pursuing majors that are mainstream at other schools. Theater and urban studies—typical course catalog fare at many universities—are popular choices for special fields at Harvard.
By contrast, the introduction of secondary fields of study has dampened demand for special concentrations that blend two existing disciplines, Foster says.
Some students say they look to other schools’ curricula when drafting their own concentration plans. Surprise or consternation that Harvard lacks a similar program often leads these students to the special concentrations office.
“I was distressed that Harvard didn’t have a theater department,” Kerr says. “There are many people who would be interested in concentrating in theater. It makes sense to have its own department and support system.”
Cosgrove likewise believes other students would pursue urban studies if it were an official concentration. Harvard administrators, she says, “have recognized a desire for an urban studies concentration, but I feel like there’s been slow progress.”
Foster says that the special concentrations program has historically been used as “a testing ground” to gauge interest in burgeoning disciplines like environmental science and global health. Some of these subjects eventually find official homes at Harvard.
“There has been a consistent trickle of students interested in theater arts, performance, and drama,” Foster notes, adding that health policy and entrepreneurship are also trending topics of study.
MORE CHOICES, MORE CHALLENGES 
Special concentrators praise the close relationships they develop with their faculty advisors, and they speak enthusiastically about the one-on-one tutorials. Liberated from departmental requirements, they celebrate the prospect of never having to take a course they will not enjoy.
“Every class I’ve taken is one I want to take,” says Cosgrove, who planned her urban studies curriculum after taking the General Education class “Designing the American City.”
Another perk is the opportunity to develop a creative thesis. Though special concentrators are not required to complete a thesis, many do, and they often choose unconventional media, like performance, for their capstone project. For example, Sanyee Yuan ’12, a special concentrator in Narrative in Rhetoric and Performance, is currently working on a play telling the story of her life, which she will perform in the spring.
But this attractive freedom poses its challenges, and special concentrators warn that discipline is required to pursue an independent course of study. The relative lack of institutional support also presents unique hurdles.
“I’ve been able to explore things that I wouldn’t be able to with requirements,” says Elizabeth Y. Y. Mak ’12. “But it’s harder when we don’t have departmental support.”
Getting into a class can be problematic, too. If departmental courses give preference to concentrators, special concentrators must be proactive and explain to professors that they need a spot too.
“It’s become especially evident as a senior, writing my thesis, that I don’t have all of the programs available in other departments,” Cosgrove says. “I think the support of a department is undervalued until you don’t have it.”
And Foster says that though the special concentrations program hosts social events, it lacks the sense of unity found in other departments.
“I don’t think there is a community among special concentrators like there is among other concentrators,” says Foster, who also serves as director of undergraduate studies in the close-knit Folklore and Mythology concentration.
Given the challenges of pursuing an alternative plan of study, Foster stresses that students should think carefully before applying for a special concentration.
“There are 40 fields with dedicated professors and faculty,” she says. “Special concentrations should be kept for students who cannot find the right combination of interests.”

The College is considering adding language to its application for admission that would allow prospective students to self-identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, or Transgender, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson.
“We want to send a positive signal to students who are grappling with the issue of [sexual orientation] or gender identity,” Fitzsimmons said. “I think this campus is really welcoming to all students and that’s the signal we want to send.”
Fitzsimmons said identification as LGBT would not act as a positive “tip” in the application process, unlike other factors like place of residence and legacy status which can help land an applicant in the group of accepted students.
Fitzsimmons said the admissions office is still working on the wording of the potential question and intends to meet with student groups in coming months to solicit feedback.
Among the possibilities under consideration is an optional essay, which could enable students to share stories and experiences that they may not have included otherwise, Fitzsimmons said. The office already added an option for applicants to the Class of 2015 to express interest in participating in LGBT student groups in the extracurricular area of the supplement.
“We endlessly stress about the wording, especially on the optional areas,” Fitzsimmons said.
A final decision on the inclusion of the question will be made by February.
Harvard Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 described the potential change as “very refreshing and progressive.” Not only would the change give applicants a more welcoming image, but it would allow the College to keep better track of how many LGBT students apply and how many are accepted, she said.
Harvard’s potential move is part of an ongoing discussion in higher education on the inclusion of such a question on college applications.
This fall, Elmhurst College, an Illinois liberal arts school, added a question that asked applicants whether they identified as LGBT.
The Common Application also considered adding questions related to sexual orientation and gender identity earlier this year, but eventually rejected the idea.
“Many admissions officers and secondary school counselors expressed concern regarding how this question might be perceived by students, even though it would be optional,” said a statement from the Common Application group. The group noted that it would likely revisit the issue sometime in the future.

Annoyed with the locked gates of Harvard Yard, John C. Lo ’15 launched an online petition Sunday urging Occupy Harvard protestors to move their tents outside the Yard, in the hopes that Cambridge’s prime tourist attraction and social space can be reopened to the public.
After Occupy Harvard protesters set up tents in Harvard Yard last Wednesday night, the administration closed nearly all the gates and restricted access to individuals with Harvard ID’s.
Lo said the “Free Harvard” petition is meant to be a voice of compromise between the Harvard administration and the Occupy Harvard movement. The petition suggests that the protesters relocate to an adjacent area, where they would not be out of sight or mind. such as the grass in front of the Science Center.
“It’s not a zero-sum game,” Lo wrote in an e-mail. As of Tuesday evening, the petition had 601 signatures.
Lo said that moving the protests to an area outside the Yard gates would benefit the Occupy Harvard movement by mitigating the negative image many hold of the protestors.
But at least one Occupy Harvard protestor said that the protest would not move.
“Student inconvenience is not on the level of global oppression,” said Sandra Y. L. Korn ’14, who is also a Crimson editorial editor. “I have little concern for students who have to walk 30 seconds more to get to CVS.”
Korn said the Free Harvard movement is directed at the wrong people. The administrators, not the protestors, made the decision to restrict gate access, she said.
“We would like the gates open just as much as everyone else,” Korn said.
Students are not the only ones who have been inconvenienced by the decision to restrict gate access.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Hahvahd Tour booth by the Harvard Square T station had only one tour guide and no customers.
Tourists who have come from around the world to see Harvard have been disappointed that some of the main Harvard attractions are off-limits to them, tour guide Wallace Duarte said.
“Peeking is not like seeing,” he added.
Korn said relocating the Occupy Harvard tents to another location other than the Yard would diminish the movement’s effectiveness.
“The point of civil disobedience is to disrupt business as usual,” Korn said.
“It’s important for us to be right here and we have no plans to leave.”
But Lo does not think that relocation would equal defeat for the Occupy Harvard movement, particularly if the protestors move to a public area like the Science Center.
“Free Harvard is a non-partisan petition composed of signatories who have transcended their political differences to effectively resolve a common situation,” Lo wrote in an e-mail.
“This is how democracy should work.”

After two weeks of rallies, protests, and threats to strike, Harvard custodians reached a tentative, five-year contract agreement with the University on Tuesday night, just an hour and a half before their current contract was set to expire.
Both the union and the University said that they were pleased with the outcome, though the details of the agreement were not immediately released.
Custodial representatives said that the new contract—which has not yet been voted on by the full union—represents a “solid victory” for workers.
“We pretty much won on all of our major issues, more so than we expected,” said Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodial workers.
The University said that the contract gives Harvard custodians generous compensation for their work.
“This package ensures that custodians at Harvard continue to earn well above the standard rate that the union has negotiated for the Boston area while guaranteeing that the University’s custodians have access to an exceptional benefits package,” Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp wrote in a statement.
“I am delighted that we have been able to reach [an] agreement on a new contract that benefits both the University and the people who help to make it one of the world’s premier institutions for research and education,” Lapp wrote.
Negotiation tensions peaked last week, when custodians threatened to strike if the University did not provide what custodians called a “fair and just” contract.
Among their demands were retention of health care benefits, benefit parity between University employees and subcontracted employees, more manageable workloads, and higher wages.
On the final day of negotiations, workers carried signs with slogans such as “Ready to Strike” and “Justice for the 99 Percent” in front of the Loeb Drama Center to show support for their bargaining representatives.
“The point of the rally was to show Harvard that we are united,” said Harvard custodian Walter Martinez.
Langley said that although the union did not attain its desired wage rate, the workers were pleased with the compromise.
“It was very close on our wages,” Langley said. “We didn’t quite get where we wanted, but it was very close. It’s a really good contract.”
Union leaders noted the importance of the “Occupy Harvard” movement in helping custodians achieve their new contract, calling it a “victory for Harvard janitors and the 99%” in a press release immediately following the negotiations.
“This is a real credit to the students. It was so helpful that the students had a social conscience and cared about the lowest paid workers,” Langley said. “I can’t begin to say how important it was that they stepped up on this.”
Union leaders hope that this contract will set an example for similar institutions when negotiating contracts with their workers.
“With Harvard’s reputation as a preeminent institution for higher education, this agreement will be seen as an example for other universities to treat workers with the dignity and respect they deserve,” wrote Local 615 publicist Sarah Betancourt in an e-mailed statement.

Harvard may sell $1.5 billion in private equity assets, as the Harvard Management Company continues its efforts to reduce the University’s illiquid holdings.
HMC, which is responsible for investing the University’s $32 billion endowment, will offer $1 billion of holdings in various U.S. private equity firms through UBS, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the sale. HMC is also selling $500 million of its energy investment portfolio through Cogent Partners, a firm that specializes in private equity sales.
Since her appointment in 2008, HMC CEO and President Jane L. Mendillo has focused on selling private equity assets to increase liquidity.
This is the same approach she took when she was in charge of Wellesley’s investment office.
After the financial crisis in 2008, HMC has taken steps to increase the University’s access to liquid assets. Private equity is an illiquid asset class and typically delivers a return on a three-to-five-year timeline.
As the crisis worsened, Mendillo sold portions of Harvard’s private equity holdings in secondary markets, selling the holdings at lower rates as supply in the market bubbled up, in order to increase Harvard’s  access to cash.
“Literally the first day after I joined, I had a meeting on selling some private equity assets,” Mendillo said in an interview last spring.
When Mendillo started selling HMC’s private equity assets in 2008, some critics accused her of making quick-fire sales. But according to HMC executives, the strategy to increase immediate liquidity—the ability to convert investments quickly into cash—and to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities of overpriced private equity.
In 2008, Harvard even issued $2.5 billion in bonds to further increase the University’s liquidity.
Last May, the University bought back about $300 million of those bonds sold in an effort to increase flexibility in making future investments.
Recent filings showed that HMC holdings in U.S.-traded equities fell by 24 percent in the last quarter, from $1.2 billion to $921 million, through a combination of HMC sales and a bear market.

Pharmaceutical companies should turn to stem cells for a more effective and cost-efficient way to experiment with new medications, Harvard professor Lee L. Rubin said in a presentation yesterday.
Rubin, who is the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology professor and a director at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, said that because stem cells mimic the biological environment of the human body, they are an effective precursor to the long and pricey clinical trial phase.
Rubin was critical of the current model for drug development, which costs upwards of $1 billion per successful drug due to the extremely high failure rate of experimental medication. Big Pharma’s current business model is to produce several hundred potential compounds a year and simply “hope one of them works,” he said.
“Most scientists agree that the drug discovery system, as currently practiced in the pharmaceutical industry, is bad,” Rubin said.
The stem cell expert advocated testing the effectiveness of medication on the cellular level using stem cells—which he argued serve as strong models for human physiology. Today, experimental drugs usually do not experience the environment of a human cell until the medicine has reached clinical trials, after millions of dollars have already been sunk into the potentially ineffective drug.
Stem cells have traditionally been used to model embryo development in vitro and as a source of cells for cell replacement therapy. Rubin believes they have yet more potential.
“Instead of using stem cells as the therapeutic, use stem cells to discover the therapeutic,” he said.
But Rubin said that large pharmaceutical companies tend to stick with institutional approaches to drug development.
“Most big companies have a certain level of inertia ... and pharmaceutical companies tend to follow that trend,” Rubin said.
But Rubin acknowledge that because pharmaceutical companies function as businesses, they must follow sensible profit-making strategies, opening the door for his innovative proposal.
One student in attendance said he appreciated the lecture’s applied approach to science.
“Rather than focusing on the broad science of stem cells and regenerative biology, this seminar was most helpful in elucidating the direction and impact of this kind of research,” Rhed Shi ’15 said. “I think that is a very important aspect of science and how it is relevant to society.”

Israeli novelist and political activist David Grossman shared the stories that influenced his latest award-winning novel, “To the End of Our Land,” at a guest lecture Tuesday night.
An audience of young and old packed a Science Center auditorium to hear Grossman discuss the important role literature plays in helping individuals explore their identity.
Grossman discussed his latest novel, which tells the story of a Jewish mother, Ora, who runs away to avoid hearing about the possible death of her son, who has been called to serve in the Israeli army.
“As parents,” Grossman said, “we do so many things for our children ... because we believe that by doing them, we are telling God or fate that we are doing our share ... and they too should do their share and spare this child.”
The novel has a semi-authobiographical tinge—just as Grossman was completing “To the End of Our Land,” the author’s own son died while fighting in the Second Lebanon War.
Praising writing as a medium, Grossman said that his craft allows him to explore different facets of his personality.
“Writing told me that there is no greater pleasure than being able—gradually, and sometimes it takes years—to remove these cataracts and surrender to this feeling,” Grossman said.
Grossman also shared his own experiences as a soldier during the First Lebanon War. His experience visiting refugee camps helped inspire the content of his novels.
Irit Aharony, the head of Harvard’s Modern Hebrew Studies Program, said that Grossman’s novels are an example of how Israeli literature can play a role in relating human experiences.
Grossman’s first two novels were named among the ten most important books since the creation of Israel, Aharony said.
“Israel appears in the newspapers mostly regarding politics,” Aharony said. She added that Grossman’s novels reflect Israel’s body of literature that relates to feelings, such as pain and love.
“He is such a fantastic author,” said Joanna F. Behrman ’13, a student who attended the event. “He knows the ins and outs of the Hebrew language and gives added depth to an already rich language.”

National security expert Mackenzie Eaglen warned against drastic military spending cuts in a talk yesterday at the Institute of Politics.
Eaglen, a former Congressional and Pentagon staffer and currently a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that the United States risks losing its military advantage if it continues to slash defense spending.
“Relative to our economy, our military spending is 26th in the world,” said Eaglen. “China’s is 4th.”
Eaglen’s talk focused on the importance of defense spending even as the country faces a massive fiscal deficit.
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has pledged to cut $450 million in defense spending over the next ten years, and has said that number could rise to $1 billion if a congressional Super Committee cannot reach agreement on government-wide spending cuts.
Eaglen grounded her argument in history, saying that the massive demilitarization and spending cuts following the end of the Cold War came at a great cost to the United States.
“It doesn’t make sense to use booms and busts,” she said, referring to the massive increase in military spending after September 11. “I like to keep things stable and reliable.”
Eaglen added that it was impossible to predict when the United States would need its military, citing the Kosovo and Bosnia conflicts of the 1990s as examples. This unpredictability makes disarmament an unattractive option, she said.
After her speech, Eaglen said she was impressed by the questions posed by the audience.
“It’s fun to see young people engaging on the issues and thinking through things,” she said. “Sometimes Washington gets the idea that no one is watching and it’s clear everyone is.”

Lisa M. Henson ’82-’83, the chief executive officer of the Jim Henson Company and eldest daughter of the famous entertainment company’s namesake, spoke at the Harvard Graduate School of Education Tuesday night to advocate for the increased use of multimedia educational tools in preschools.
“Whether you believe that children should watch television or not, it’s inarguable that children do watch television,” Henson said.
Hence it is important, Henson said, to create meaningful and educational television that accommodates the pervasiveness of new media technologies.
Henson gave the example of her father, Jim Henson, who, with his wife, founded the Jim Henson Company. The company went on in 1969 to create “Sesame Street,” the longest running children’s show in television history. Lisa Henson explained that her father “was very inspired by the challenge of educating kids through the medium of television.”
Television at the time was an innovative concept, Henson said, and although puppetry had been used on television before, the puppets were always seen as part of a puppet stage.
Henson continued by discussing the company’s current educational shows, such as “Dinosaur Train” and “Sid the Science Kid,” both of which are computer animated and geared to teach preschoolers about science.
“In working with these shows we have become particularly aware of the need for preschoolers and their caregivers to be conscious of scientific literacy,” Henson said. “We feel that the goal has a lot of relevance and urgency today.”
Although this type of educational television will always have its critics, Henson said her company’s “research indicates that what we do is working. Children that watch our show have a strong ability to recall content.”
“I believe that we can use television and film to be an influence for good,” Henson recalled her father saying, “that we can shape the thoughts of children and adults in a positive way.”
Henson graduated summa cum laude from Harvard with a degree in Folklore and Mythology. As a student, she served as the first female president of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Henson’s presentation was part of the Askwith Forum, an ongoing lecture series hosted by the Ed School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—It didn’t come easily, but the Harvard men’s basketball team got the job done.
In its first road contest of the 2011-12 season, the Crimson (2-0) pulled away in the second half, grabbing a commanding 73-64 win over Holy Cross (0-2) in a non-conference matchup last night at the Hart Center.
“[It was a] tough win for us against a team that I thought played exceptionally hard, exceptionally well,” said Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, whose squad trailed by as many as six late in the first half to the underdog Crusaders.
But after a late first-half Crimson run evened the score at 34 heading into halftime, Harvard rode the momentum into the second period, thanks in large part to a new offensive plan: get the ball to co-captain Keith Wright.
The strategy paid off, as Wright notched nine points in the first 5:59 of the second half to give Harvard an eight-point lead, 48-40.
“I thought [we’d] try establish him right away,” Amaker said of Wright, who finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds in his first double-double performance of the year. “I thought we’d give our team a shot in the arm. I thought it certainly worked out in our favor.”
While the Crusaders managed to get back within three midway through the second period, the Crimson never trailed again en route to the nine-point win.
Harvard was once again anchored by its frontcourt duo of Wright and junior Kyle Casey, who combined for 31 points and 14 rebounds.
While Wright carried the Crimson in the second half, Casey did most of his damage in the first, notching 11 of his team-high 16 points in the opening period. The 6’7 forward also displayed his range, knocking down a pair of three-pointers. Casey’s first three, which put the Crimson ahead, 20-19, with 8:14 to play in the first half, was his first trey since Dec. 1, 2010.
But on the whole, Harvard shied away from relying on the deep ball, attempting just nine three-pointers on the night. Instead, the Crimson focused on attacking the basket, notching 46 points in the paint and getting to the charity stripe 25 times.
Wright and Casey weren’t the only Harvard players to get it done in the paint, as freshman Wes Saunders finished with 10 points, eight of which came off three consecutive and-one layups midway through the second half.
But before the Crimson established itself in the post in the second half, the Crusaders controlled the paint. Led by forward Phil Beans’ three first-half offensive rebounds, Holy Cross pulled down nine offensive rebounds and scored 10 second-chance points.
With 2:27 to play in the first, the Crusaders grabbed their largest lead of the game after center Dave Dudzinski corralled a missed three-pointer and finished a layup, putting his team up, 34-28, and forcing Amaker to use a 30-second timeout.
Walking back to the huddle, a visibly frustrated Oliver McNally yelled at his teammates to pick up their aggressiveness on the glass.
“We got hit in the mouth a little bit in the first half,” said the co-captain, who finished with 14 points on nine shots. “We were really soft down low. Our bigs weren’t catching the ball, and our guards were just hanging around expecting them to do everything.”
The Crimson came out of the timeout on a tear. On its first possession out of the break, junior point guard Brandyn Curry up-faked past his defender, drew the help, and found freshman Steve Moundou-Missi open under the basket for the slam.
Curry attacked the basket again on the visitors’ next possession, this time finishing it himself to pull Harvard within two.
After the Crimson recovered a turnover from Holy Cross’s Devin Brown—who finished with a game-high 17 points—Harvard controlled the ball with 37 seconds remaining and a chance to even the score.
The Crimson opted to go back to Moundou-Missi, as McNally zipped a pass to the rookie in the post, and Moundou-Missi finished the layup with seven seconds remaining to even the score heading into halftime.
Coming out of the break, Harvard continued its run, getting baskets from Wright and Casey to go up by five. Wright extended the Crimson’s lead to eight, finishing an alley-oop and converting a free throw with 14:01 to go.
The Crusaders got back within three with 9:20 to play, but Saunders tough finishes at the basket helped Harvard withstand the Crusader run, and the Crimson cruised to the nine-point win.
Once again, rebounding was an issue for the Crimson, as Holy Cross outrebounded Harvard 28-24, and came up with 14 offensive rebounds. Wright was the only Crimson player with more than four rebounds.
“Balls were just kind of squirting through our hands, and that’s disappointing,” Amaker said. “I think [the rebounding numbers are] a little misleading. It’s not like we weren’t there or out of position—we just can’t grab the ball with two hands. I’m not sure what drill we have for that, but I think we’ll be all right.”
But for the second game in a row, the Crimson’s poor performance on the glass didn’t seem to be a major issue, as Harvard notched its fourth straight victory over the Crusaders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tuesday’s Euro 2012 playoff contests saw eight teams either suffer heartbreak or erupt in celebration. For tiny Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, and the usually powerful Turkey, it’s time to go home and reflect on what had been a valiant effort to qualify for the European Championships.
The sadness on these players’ faces reminded me of what I witnessed on Saturday afternoon at BU’s Nickerson Field. After the final whistle, and the home team erupted in celebration while the visitors bowed their heads in disappointment. The Terriers had battled their way to the next round of the NCAA tournament while the result sent the Harvard women’s soccer team back to campus with a bittersweet conclusion to an otherwise bright season.
Rookie goalkeeper Bethany Kanten crumpled to the ground, lamenting her performance in her first NCAA appearance of her young career. The freshman did not play like one all season, making critical saves throughout and finishing with a 1.12 goals-against average. But her first loss in 10 games overwhelmed her, and the 3-0 score line was, in my opinion, an unjust way to end a strong rookie campaign—not to mention the fact that the first goal was questionable, at the very least.
BU’s opening score came off a strange play in the penalty area. The Terriers took a high corner kick, which Kanten jumped up to snatch. While the freshman was in flight, a BU forward collided with Kanten, leaving her on the ground and granting Terrier Kylie Strom a shot on an open goal. The referee kept the whistle tucked away, and Strom wasted no time in putting the ball in the back of the net.
The tally boosted BU’s confidence, and a second goal came shortly off of a good buildup by the Terrier offense.
At halftime, talks erupted in the press box and on BU’s radio channel about the referee’s decision to allow play to continue after Kanten fell to the ground. But while there was disagreement about the call, most of us agreed that the scoreboard was fair in demonstrating how dominant the Terriers were to start the match—BU had outshot Harvard, 7-4, and had no trouble controlling possession in the midfield.
To Kanten’s dismay, a Crimson own goal left the rookie helpless and sealed the deal midway through the second period.
While Crimson coach Ray Leone and co-captain Melanie Baskind declined to comment on the first goal, Leone did laud his team for being a resilient bunch throughout the season, always coming from behind when they needed to. A win against a team ranked No. 12 in the country just wasn’t meant to be. BU captured its 14th win in a row on Saturday, a stretch that saw the Terriers outscore their opponents, 42-4. That’s just absurd.
And getting the first goal in a match like this means everything. An experienced and prolific BU team dictated the pace of the game. It deserves its spot in the next round.
While a comeback might have been possibile, Harvard’s inexperience showed on Saturday. Though there were flashes of the level of play that the Crimson demonstrated this season, the visitors never got their rhythm going and were clunky in the midfield, failing to string enough passes together and allowing the Terriers to strip them of the ball too many times.
This postseason loss serves as a valuable experience for the young team. After the class of 2011’s departure, one of the most interesting story lines was how the incoming class of players was going step up. The strong rookie class helped the team reached a phase it hadn’t last year: the NCAA tournament.
Leading the youth were co-captains Baskind and Lindsay Kowal, who were among the only ones composed and collected after Saturday’s loss. They were of course dejected that their final season had to come to close, but the seniors were immensely proud of the strides this team made this year. Harvard finished undefeated in league play and had its best record in over 10 years, captured the Ancient Eight crown, and boasts the Ivy League Player of the Year in Baskind.
Chins up, girls. After achieving all this, there is really nothing to cry about. There’s only next season to which to look forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—Having had the Crusaders’ number in recent memory, Harvard was favored to drop Holy Cross for the fourth time in four seasons heading into Tuesday night’s matchup.
And yet with 2:27 to play in the first half, a Hart Center crowd of 1,892 erupted into cheers as a put-back by Crusader forward Dave Dudzinski gave the hosts a six-point advantage.
Making only his second career start, the sophomore rotated with junior center Phil Beans—who missed all but seven games last season due to injury—to provide a stiff first-half challenge to the Crimson’s combination of co-captain Keith Wright and junior Kyle Casey. During the first period, Holy Cross had a 24-18 edge in points in the paint, as its relatively unheralded big men crashed the offensive glass, found open cutters, and finished at the rim.
Though it struggled to convert its own second-chance opportunities early on, Harvard maintained its aggressiveness throughout the half and was rewarded with consistent trips to the free throw line, where it took 14 attempts compared to the hosts’ four. The Crimson reached the bonus period with over 10 minutes left in the frame and went on to sink 10-of-10 attempts at the stripe leading up to intermission.
Accordingly, the success of the Crusaders inside dropped as its small stable of big men dwindled. Despite gathering team-highs of eight rebounds and four blocks, Beans fouled out at 11:54 in the second, and forward Taylor Abt joined him on the bench two minutes later. Dudzinski managed to avoid the same fate until 8:08 was left in the contest. A motivated Harvard ended up with a 28-10 advantage in paint scoring in the final half.
EN GUARD
Though the emergence of the Crusaders in the paint may have been a surprise, the team’s reliance on the play of its primary ball-handlers was not. All-Patriot League second-team guard Devin Brown and junior wing R.J. Evans, a former Patriot League Rookie of the Year, had a game-high 17 and 13 points, respectively.
But the Holy Cross starting backcourt of the 6’1 Brown and 5’9 freshman Justin Burrell seemed to have found its match in Harvard’s physical guards—especially, junior Brandyn Curry.
“Brandyn has long range with his arms and quick hands, and I thought he did a tremendous job of getting deflections and then getting up the floor,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Brown and Burrell combined for 13 turnovers on the night.
With under eight minutes to go in the game and the Crimson clinging to a four-point lead, Curry’s quick hands stripped a charging Brown, leading to a three-point play by co-captain Oliver McNally. Two Crusader possessions later, Curry poked the ball away from Burrell on a drive and eventually was fouled on a coast-to-coast layup try. Holy Cross’s Dee Goens then tried a dribble drive, but he too had his pocket picked by Curry, whose fast-break layup gave Harvard a lead that would not fall below double digits until the final play of the game.
ROCKY ROOKIE ROAD
Although a total of four Crimson freshmen, including guard Corbin Miller and forward Jonah Travis, saw action Tuesday, two in particular came off the bench to tip the night’s outcome in Harvard’s favor. Besides providing another interior presence while Wright battled early foul trouble, Steve Moundou-Missi helped Harvard close the first half on a high note with a pair of layups. He saw less action in the second, when Wright went on a tear straight out of intermission, but he finished the night with six points on 3-of-4 shooting along with a pair of rebounds.
In the second half, his classmate Wes Saunders shined. In a two-minute span, the highly touted rookie—who received offers from Colorado and USC—scored eight straight points, converting two of a trio of possible three-point plays.
“Wes doesn’t have a great outside game, but he really knows how to get to the rim and use his body and use his strength,” McNally said.
The sequence showed off everything the uber-athletic wing has to offer: first, a steal and a race down the floor with two defenders draped all over him; next, a drive into the paint for a layup; and finally, a strong move right at the basket while drawing contact. Although the class of 2015 had its fair share of mistakes, including a turnover that set up a key Holy Cross three-pointer, Saunders closed out his night with a two-handed slam off a feed from Curry, tallying Harvard’s final points of the night.
“We don’t play as well—or maybe we don’t win—without Wesley Saunders this evening,” Amaker said.

Nextpedition, a new program based out of the American Express Travel Office in Harvard Square, brings mystery and convenience to traveling by offering customized trips to an unknown destination.The program aims to appeal to travelers of the "digital/social media savvy Millennial generation," according to American Express spokesperson Marisa S. Schneer, by also incorporating social media to share your adventures and smartphone technology for providing your itinerary throughout the trip.
"It brings [travelers] the excitement of not knowing where they are going or what they are doing, while adding the comfort of both the mobile device and the help of an American Express travel specialist," Schneer said.
The program begins by taking an online quiz that asks 15 questions and generates a travel sign. The signs include "Adrenalista" for the outdoor adventurer, "Tasteblazer" for the food obsessed, and "Disco Trekker" for the late-night partier.
From there, you can just show off your travel sign by posting it to your Facebook page or you start planning the trip by calling the Harvard Square office and speaking to a specialist. The specialist designs a trip based on your travel sign, budget, and travel history. The rest of the planning, including flights, hotels, and excursions, is left to the specialist.
Three days before your departure, you receive a smartphone in the mail that reveals your destination, a packing list, and your boarding pass. Each trip includes two destinations either in North America or Europe.
Each day, the device reveals your itinerary that can also be shared on Facebook to your friends back home. The specialists plan authentic activities for each destination, such as cooking in a French kitchen or learning how to ride a gondola in Italy.
The rest of your trip is free time, but the device includes activity and restaurant recommendations along with a guidebook for each city. American Express specialists are also available 24-hours a day for assistance during the trip.
Specialists ask that the travelers book their trips at least three months in advance, so if a Nextpedition piques your interest, better take that travel quiz now.

The last time Shaq received publicity for being in Harvard Square, it was for a rather stoic reason.However, this Saturday, recently-retired NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal will have another appearance in the Square, this time at the Harvard Book Store, signing copies of his newly released autobiography, "Shaq Uncut: My Story."
Though it may appear to be unfortunate timing for many Harvard students, as they will either be subjecting themselves to New Haven for the sake of watching The Game, or attending the Celtics' Rajon Rondo’s exhibition, the seven-footer will be signing his massive autograph at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.
For a guy who has had countless nicknames such as "The Big Leprechaun" while playing for the Celtics and "The Big Cactus" while missing free-throws for the Suns, Shaq will surely try to add one more to his resume this weekend: The Big Author.
He clearly didn't get the memo that basketball players are not supposed to be working right now.

John Harvard is no Kevin Bacon, but that doesn't mean that our University's benefactor isn't good for a game of "Six Degrees of Separation." The relationship between John Harvard and William Shakespeare is closer than many would have thought, according to an article recently pubished in the Financial Times.
To discover the extent of Harvard's connections, look no further than a narrow, three-story home located at 26 High Street in Stratford-upon-Avon. Now known as Harvard House, the residence once belonged to Thomas and Alice Rogers, grandparents of John Harvard and neighbors of a certain William Shakespeare.
John Harvard's grandfather, Thomas Rogers, built what is now known as Harvard House in 1596. One year later, Stratford native William Shakespeare bought New Place, the home where he would eventually retire, just down the road from Harvard House. It is thought that Rogers and Shakespeare—both prominent men of Stratford—were likely to have known one another. Indeed, the Shakespeare and Rogers families both worshipped at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Stratford, and records show that Shakespeare's twins and Rogers' daughter, Katherine, were christened there within three months of each other. Katherine went on to marry Robert Harvard in that very same church in 1605.
The connections, however, don't stop there. It is believed that John Harvard's father Robert, a butcher in the south London district of Southwark (home of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre), may have crossed paths with the famous playwright as well. In Southwark, Shakespeare attended St. Saviour's Cathedral, the church where John Harvard was eventually baptized and where Robert Harvard served as an alderman with one of Shakespeare's close colleagues, Philip Henslowe (i.e., Geoffrey Rush in "Shakespeare in Love"). It is even thought that Shakespeare and his brother, Edmund, may have been responsible for introducing Robert Harvard to Katherine Rogers.
While the social mingling of John Harvard's family and William Shakespeare remains a matter of conjecture, Harvard House still stands on High Street in Stratford-upon-Avon and serves as a tourist attraction and home of the Museum of British Pewter.

With the Christmas media circus already starting up at some stores in the Square, it might be easy to forget that fall brings its own seasonal treats to shelves and menus. Here's a little taste of the pumpkin-flavored foods that Harvard Square has to offer.
At Boloco, you can try a pumpkin pie shake. It's basically like drinking liquid pumpkin pie, which its greatest strength and its greatest drawback. Not only is this a way to get your pumpkin fix on the go, but every purchase supports prostate cancer research.
Cardullo's is a treasure trove of pumpkin flavor. Their pumpkin pie soda has a subtle spicy taste which evokes thoughts of fall rather than of high-fructose corn syrup.
Pumpkin marshmallows also offer seasonal spice with the sweet, sticky texture of a fresh bag of Stay Pufts.
If you want something other than peppermint and fruitcake for the next month and a half, the delicious and complex taste of pumpkin will get you through the season.

Tickets in the Harvard student section for Saturday's game are officially sold out. Never fear, though: the friendly Harvard athletics department has opened up an adjacent section to accommodate the unusually high number of Crimson fans traveling to Yale this year.
"We've had higher demand this year than we've had in the past," said Nicholas G. Majocha, the athletics ticket manager. "This is not normally how it goes."
Majocha said that there are about 400 tickets left in the new section. But considering that the box office sold almost 1000 tickets yesterday, Majocha predicts that those seats will sell out by the end of the day on Thursday. All student tickets cost $15.
If you wait to buy tickets at Yale, not only will you be seated away from your friends, but you also will have to pay more. The cheapest (and worst) seats sold at Yale are in the Bulldogs' end zone, for a cost of $20. Imagine cheering for Harvard in a sea of angry blue—there might be more crimson than the color of your shirt by the end of the game.
To pick up tickets before you leave for New Haven, trek down to the Murr Center. It's all the way down JFK Street across the bridge. Enter through Gate 1, walk straight until you see the building's main entrance, and turn left once you get inside. The box office is the place with the long line of impatient students.
If you have a really nice roommate, you should be aware that unlike most athletic events, students are allowed to pick up tickets for friends for this game as long as they show a Harvard ID.

With The Game just days away "On Harvard Time" presents "Air Bully," the story of a safety school's struggling football team, its "piece-of-shit" player Josh, and Bully, a football-playing dog. Bully, who's certainly no Air Bud, inspires his fellow Elis to try to become more than just salutatorians, second-chair violinists, and student council vice-presidents. But will Bully lead Yale to victory? Will Josh remain a piece-of-shit forever? Watch the video—and The Game—to find out.

A writer poking around at a yard sale recently found a recipe book that offers a peek into history. Called "Political Pot Luck: A Collection of Recipes from Men Only," the book was published in 1959 and contains submissions from a variety of male political figures of the time. One recipe comes from John F. Kennedy '40, who—among other accomplishments—was  apparently a decent waffle chef (as well as a former Crimson business  editor).
 
Kennedy's  breakfast concoction calls for flour, buttermilk, butter, sugar, and  eggs—almost the exact same ingredients as Veritaffles, according to  Harvard University Dining Services Spokesperson Crista Martin. Kennedy  puts in just one other ingredient, baking powder, and suggests eating  his waffles with warm maple syrup and melted butter.
 
Martin  wrote in an email to Flyby that Harvard students eat more than 125,000  waffles every year at Sunday brunches. If that's not enough to satisfy  you, you can try your hand at JFK's recipe in any House or dorm kitchen.
 
There are some recipes in the book, which contains food from such non-culinary notables as Adlai E. Stevenson II and Hubert H. Humphrey, Jr., that we don't recommend you use. Take a look at this recipe from reporter Frank Trippett.
 
Ah, 1959. Don't let the door hit you on your way out.

Although sporting events, such as the upcoming football game, may epitomize the Harvard-Yale rivalry, the two schools can also compare who is scoring in another physical arena. Just as Yale decided it would no longer allow students to use Yale's name in its annual "Sex Week at Yale," Harvard is making plans for its own, similar week with the very original and fresh title of "Sex Week at Harvard College."
In the unlikely event that you are one of the students who has engaged in the horizontal mambo during your college career, or in the more likely event that you hope to one day have sex, "Sex Week at Harvard College" may be useful for you. It aims to expand student awareness of sexual health, wellness, and to facilitate conversations about sex and sexuality. Indeed, it seems that, for all the sex Harvard students are not having, they sure like to talk about it.
"Sex Week was born out of a simple idea: what happens when we embrace Harvard student interest in issues of sex and sexuality?" said co-founder of the program Samantha A. Meier '12.
Although "Sex Week at Yale" had a similar mission, after reevaluating the actual content of the events, Yale determined that the content of "Sex Week at Yale" had strayed from its original mission. In fact, Yalies complain the week has become more about porn than sexual issues, claiming about one third of the events are hosted by people involved in the adult video industry.
But before you knock Yalies for being too prudish it might do to remember that Yalies traditionally have a higher average number of sexual partners than Harvard students—2 for Yale compared to 1 for Harvard within their four years according polls conducted by their respective newspapers. Well, at least Yale is good at something.
