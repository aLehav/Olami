After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The belief that there is not enough mental health care at Harvard has pervaded most of the campus’s collective consciousness. Op-ed after op-ed has alleged that Counseling and Mental Health Services is not sufficient. Often, students suggest that more therapists are what we need to deliver us from the looming crisis.
These frequent calls for more resources, while understandable, are not going to solve the mental health crisis on campus. More resources are certainly beneficial, but there is not truly a shortage of mental health support at Harvard. The shortage is only a perception.
Peer counseling groups constantly advertise their services with fliers and emails. The CAMHS Cares hotline offers 24/7 phone access to a licensed therapist. For recurring care, a Mather House tutor offers professional wellness counseling to the River East Houses — a service which, though excellent, still needs to send emails offering El Jefe’s Taqueria gift cards in order to attract the attention of students.
Despite their obvious availability, these resources seem to be nowhere near capacity. In my own experience running a peer counseling group, there’s much more demand to become a peer counselor than to seek peer counseling.
Now, it might be argued that these services, though certainly therapeutic, do not constitute a recurring treatment of psychotherapy. After all, isn’t there a shortage of professional therapists at CAMHS? Aren’t wait times still weeks long?
Not necessarily. Though the number of CAMHS’ in-house therapists and the wait to meet with one is still non-ideal, Harvard University Health Services has been working to build infrastructure to make up the difference.
For an example, take CAMHS’ TimelyMD partnership, which allows students to easily access therapists through the platform TimelyCare — they just might not be directly employed by CAMHS. TimelyMD is a Texas-based company aiming to provide telehealth services by licensed medical professionals to college students nationwide. Using TimelyCare, every enrolled Harvard student has access to 12 virtual therapy sessions with an independent, licensed clinical therapist per academic year, free of cost. Twelve sessions is a relatively standard amount of therapy, enough to treat most college students’ mental health concerns. Furthermore, wait times for these sessions are only about two days.
With its massive staff of therapists, TimelyCare easily has the capacity to provide therapy to every Harvard student. The TimelyMD company currently provides care to over 1.5 million students nationwide.
And whether it’s professional psychotherapy or a more novel type of care, for a student struggling with mental illness, any one of the aforementioned programs could significantly improve psychological wellbeing. We should remember not to undervalue the lay therapist or the age-old network of communal support and care.
So, why aren’t students using TimelyCare, or any other practices from the vast array of underutilized resources at this school?
One possibility is that students aren’t aware that a surplus of mental health resources exist. The long wait times for CAMHS are well documented, and it’s reasonable that a student might feel that a long wait time is not worth the bother, or that their problems don’t warrant using ostensibly strained resources.
I would argue, however, that there are enough resources. If you think that you might even slightly benefit from any of these, you should use them.
Beyond this, I believe that there is another factor at play: namely, a culture that sees a trade off between self-care and the pursuit of our goals. As much as we know that it would be healthier to do less and put more emphasis on our health, it’s incredibly difficult to do that at a school whose entire reputation is predicated on being the best.
The mental health crisis at Harvard is not a crisis of a lack of resources, but rather a crisis of culture: the inevitable collision between our drive for ceaseless achievement and the painful fact that we are mere mortals.
Despite the difficulty of self-care here, however, we remain free to take better care of ourselves. Now, more than ever, we have the resources to do so — if only we reach out and take advantage of them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The idea for this piece came to me on a run. It wasn’t even really a run, more of a half-run, half-walk situation that would have made me very embarrassed a year ago. My pace was slow, and I had a heavy coat on that was weighing me down — mainly because I had intended it to be a walk before I got bored and started running. It wasn’t anything impressive, certainly not something that would make someone think that I was one of the captains of my track team in high school.
But I was, and yet when I exercise now it often looks like this.
Many of us here are ex-athletes. Always overachieving and searching for the next organization to join, we were led into sports, and many of us were good at them, too. We were captains and team leaders, we led teams to championships, and we competed at regional, state, and even national levels. We devoted countless hours to our teams, committing hours almost every day of the week to practice. It was rewarding to see ourselves become so physically skilled: so fast, so strong, so agile.
But now we’re in college, and that’s gone — not for all of us, but for the vast majority. With a new schedule, new clubs we feel compelled to join, and no threat of a yelling coach, it's easy to put exercise first on the chopping block.
There’s a certain shame in not working out as much as you used to, not being guaranteed a worked-up sweat everyday to make you feel good about yourself. In high school, physical exhaustion was a symbol of accomplishment, and aching muscles were a source of pride. A lot of us lack that now. With such a routine source of achievement gone, it's easy to feel ashamed, or at least a little lost.
It’s difficult to realize that you can’t do as many pull-ups, or that you can’t run that six-minute mile you ran a year ago, or that you can’t do nearly as many consecutive backflips. It hurts to no longer see yourself as stereotypically physically fit, despite those standards being largely unattainable.
I’m not stubborn enough to try to fight against the fact that exercise is good for you. But demanding exercise isn’t the only way to be happy, and it’s also not the only way to take care of your physical health. It often seems like the end-all be-all, and after years of running I often struggle to accept it myself.
It wasn’t healthy to define myself by how fast I could run a lap around the track. It definitely wasn’t good to see how long I could last before practicing the hurdles got a little too dangerous because of exhaustion. Looking back, it was stupid to still try to practice when injured, and to feel bad when I missed even one workout. What I thought was so healthy couldn’t have been any less.
So now I try to remember the other aspects of health besides physical fitness. It’s good to focus on how friendships can lengthen your lifespan, how spending time outdoors lessens anxiety and muscle tension, and how eating a variety of foods gives you nutrients you otherwise would have missed. I open my windows when it’s not too cold out and my water bottle is always being refilled. I still enjoy exercise, but I’m glad it’s no longer the only factor I value in determining my health.
So instead of wallowing about your past athletic days, as I so frequently did at the beginning of my freshman year, experience the seasons that Cambridge offers outdoors. Seek out new and old friends to simply be around — even call it networking if that motivates you. Try new foods, and if you ever just feel like walking, feel good about it.
I’ll continue to go on my unplanned half-runs, half-walks, where my legs don’t hurt incessantly and I have the energy to enjoy my surroundings. I’ll keep enjoying jogging alongside the Charles river and taking pictures on top of the many bridges that span it. These days, I know that that’s good enough.

Mental health experts discussed the impact of social media and supportive relationships with adults on teenage mental health at a Harvard Graduate School of Education panel Tuesday.
The panelists included Linda Charmaraman, director of the Youth, Media, and Wellbeing Research Lab at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College; Lisa K. Damour, author and clinical psychologist; Alisha R. Moreland-Capuia, Harvard Medical School assistant professor; and HGSE senior lecturer Richard Weissbourd.
The forum is the most recent installment of HGSE’s Askwith Education Forum series, which invites panelists to speak on topics that affect schools and students of all ages.
HGSE senior lecturer Josephine M. Kim, who moderated the panel, opened the conversation by providing a definition of mental health.
“Mental health, defined by the World Health Organization, is a state of well-being in which the individual realizes their own abilities, they can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to their community,” Kim said.
Charmaraman said it is important to understand the role of social media in adolescent mental health.
“This is the reality of 2023 — that it’s an ever pervasive digital landscape. Adolescents are growing up in an ecosystem that is a blurred boundary between real life and digital life,” Charmaraman said.
Weissbourd — who is also the director of Making Caring Common, an HGSE project that aims to help parents and educators raise respectful children — said social media and cellphone use contribute to teenage mental health concerns.
“I don’t understand why kids can have cellphones in schools. I just think we should ban cellphones from schools,” Weissbourd said. “Am I missing something?”
Moreland-Capuia, the founder and director of the Institute for Trauma-Informed Systems Change at McLean Hospital, said there is a purpose for cellphones in schools, citing parental concerns about school shootings.
“We have to appreciate our history, our destiny, but be in our reality. And the reality is that people don’t feel safe, and the phone, in some cases, helps parents — whether it’s an illusion or not — feel a little bit safer,” Moreland-Capuia said.
Excessive use of technology can also affect teen wellness by disrupting regular sleep patterns, Damour said.
“What gets in the way of sleep for teens? Social media or digital technology in the bedroom overnight,” Damour said. “They should just not be there. There’s no reason for it.”
One strategy for mitigating declining mental health in teens is through cultivating relationships with caring adults, according to Damour and Weissbourd.
“We know what supports adolescent mental health, and it is strong relationships with caring adults,” Damour said.
Adults that can fill this role include teachers, coaches, school secretaries, and custodians, according to Weissbourd.
“We have to create mentor-rich environments,” Weissbourd said.
HGSE student Morgan K. Downing, who attended the forum, said the panel’s lessons about working toward strong mental health in teens can be applied to students of all ages.
“My area of expertise is more in early childhood, but I know that early childhood students eventually become teenagers,” Downing said. “So it’s like, ‘How can I foster what I learned here to then support the earlier kids?’”
Sari Saint-Hilaire, another HGSE student and forum attendee, said she hopes audience members leave the forum with a more open-minded perspective on mental health.
“The spirit of learning, the spirit of going to research something you didn’t know before, the spirit of admitting that you were wrong about something — just not being afraid to be human, as they said, I think that’s very important,” Saint-Hilaire said.

Undergraduates in the Harvard AI Safety Team have ramped up activity amid heightened public concern over artificial intelligence’s rapid development and lack of regulation.
The group, which was founded last spring and has grown to 35 Harvard and MIT students with a fellowship program of roughly 50 other students, conducts research and hosts reading groups each semester. HAIST projects — which center around reducing risks from AI — have included new methods for detecting anomalous behavior by AI as well as a project locating the components within AI systems that are responsible for specific behavior.
HAIST Director and Founder Alexander L. Davies ’23 wrote in an email that he decided to start the group after he began conducting machine learning research, where he confronted arguments that “increasingly powerful AI systems might pose serious risks to humanity.”
In a joint statement, Davies and HAIST Deputy Director Max L. Nadeau ’23 wrote about the need for more research into AI safety and their concern that as AI systems become more powerful, they may “potentially learn to deceive and manipulate human evaluators.”
“Compared to the rapid progress in making AI systems more powerful and economically relevant, we’ve had less success in understanding these AIs and increasing their reliability,” Davies and Nadeau wrote. “Even the most advanced AI systems confidently assert falsehoods, respond maliciously to users, and write insecure code that evades the notice of the humans they are meant to assist.”
Nadeau wrote that there are external pressures influencing the development of potentially dangerous AI models.
“Economic or military competition between organizations building powerful AI may create a race to the bottom, in which organizations deploy dangerous models early to stay ahead of their competition, despite the fact that many of the leaders of top AI companies acknowledge extremely high levels of risk from future systems,” he wrote.
HAIST member and MIT graduate student Stephen M. Casper ’21 said much of HAIST’s work is to ensure research and governance are not “so badly outpaced by technology,” emphasizing that technological progress can “put lots of power into the hands of very few people.”
“There are a million good things and a million bad things that AI systems could do,” Casper said. “I think there’s the mentality about AI being very impactful and a mentality about risk and reducing it,” he said.
In addition to pursuing research on AI topics, HAIST also offers an introductory reading group with a curriculum created in collaboration with Richard Ngo, a researcher at OpenAI. OpenAI created ChatGPT, a viral chatbot that generates AI responses to a user’s prompts.
“HAIST is an attempt to create the intellectual community around AI safety research that I wish I’d had when I was first getting interested in it,” Davies wrote.
“We believe that AI safety is an interesting technical problem, and may also be one of the most important problems of our time,” he added.

Harvard Computer Science professor Cynthia Dwork discussed the shortcomings of risk prediction algorithms at the Center of Mathematical Sciences and Applications’ annual Ding Shum lecture Tuesday evening.
During the talk — titled “Measuring Our Chances: Risk Prediction in This World and its Betters” — Dwork presented her research to a crowd of nearly 100 attendees. The Ding Shum lecture, funded by Ding Lei and Harry Shum, covers an active area of research in applied mathematics. In the previous three years, the series was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Tuesday’s discussion, which was also livestreamed online, was moderated by CMSA postdoctoral fellow Faidra Monachou.
Dwork began her talk by presenting what she described as a fundamental problem in how algorithms are applied.
“I’m claiming that risk prediction is the defining problem of AI, meaning that there’s a huge definitional problem associated with what we commonly call risk prediction,” Dwork said.
She said that although predictions may assign a numerical probability towards an event happening, these predictions are very difficult to interpret for one-time events, which either happen or do not.
“You have, maybe, intuitive senses of what these mean. But in fact, it’s quite mysterious. What is the meaning of the probability of an unrepeatable event?” Dwork asked.
In addition, it can be difficult to tell whether a prediction function is accurate based on observing binary outcomes, Dwork said.
“If I predict something with three quarters probability, both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ are possible outcomes. And when we see one, we don’t know whether I was right about that three quarters,” Dwork said.
“How do we say: is that a good function, or is that a bad function? We don’t even know what it’s supposed to be doing,” she added.
To illustrate the complexity of the issue, Dwork asked the audience to consider two worlds. In one, “there is no uncertainty in what’s going to happen in the future,” but current predictors may lack enough information to make an accurate guess. In the other, “there’s real inherent uncertainty,” meaning that outcomes may change even if prediction processes are perfect.
The issue, Dwork said, is “these two worlds are really indistinguishable.”
Since all algorithms take in inputs to predict a “yes” or “no” output, Dwork said the predictions will not reveal whether real life is “arbitrary and real valued” or binary.
But Dwork said in her research, she has been able to draw from the field of pseudorandom numbers to help detect the difference between these two situations.
“So now, instead of trying to determine whether a sequence is random, or pseudorandom, our distinguishers are trying to determine whether an outcome is drawn from real life,” she explained.
Dwork, who is also a faculty affiliate at Harvard Law School and a distinguished scientist at Microsoft Research, is known for her contributions to the areas of differential privacy and algorithmic fairness. In 2020, she received the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Hamming Medal for her work in “privacy, cryptography, and distributed computing, and for leadership in developing differential privacy.”
To conclude her talk, Dwork presented a roadmap of her future research.
“The next step is to try to develop an understanding of what it is that transformations that satisfy this technical property can actually accomplish,” Dwork said.

American political scientist and award-winning author Susan C. Stokes ’81 discussed the correlation between income inequality and democratic erosion at the Center for Government and International Studies on Tuesday afternoon.
The discussion was moderated by Harvard Professor of Government and Director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Steve R. Levitsky.
Stokes, who teaches at the University of Chicago and helms its Chicago Center of Democracy, criticized politicians’ use of polarizing narratives in order to win over supporters amid high income inequality. She said these narratives have been pushed by both “right-wing ethno-nationalists” and “left-wing populists who exacerbated polarization and trampled on democratic institutions.”
“Partisan polarization induces voters to be willing to give up democratic institutions, if that’s the price that they have to pay to keep the hated other side out of power,” Stokes said. “Inequality has encouraged politics of grievance and encourages ambitious leaders to push a polarizing ‘us versus them’ discourse and actions that reduce accountability to electorates.”
Based on a statistical model by linguistics scholar Adam Jaworski, at the onset of the Trump administration, “the probability of American democracy failing” was “indistinguishable from zero,” Stokes said. Today, however, the United States has steeply increased to a roughly 15 percent likelihood of “erosion,” according to Stokes.
Stokes said the reason behind the increase in democratic decline in the U.S. can be attributed in part to its inequality in comparison to other wealthy countries.
Stokes said coups led by militaries against elected leaders are distinct from instances in which elected leaders attack their own democratic institutions. According to Stokes, while data shows that coups by the military peaked in the 1970s, erosion of democracy by elected leaders is mainly a 21st century phenomenon.
Although previous data analysis models have lacked “systematic evidence” comparing countries with democratic erosion, Stokes said the new model she presents demonstrates income inequality as “the key risk factor” in democratic erosion across countries. This risk is greater for countries that are “unequal and wealthy,” Stokes said.
Stokes said there are flaws in overly positive attitudes toward neoliberalism, arguing “the promise of a rising tide” of neoliberalism will not “lift all boats.”
“Heightened income inequality increases the danger of erosion, and speaks volumes about the political perils of economic inequality,” she said.

Members of Harvard’s graduate student union voted at a meeting Tuesday to affiliate with undergraduate student workers currently collecting union cards for official recognition.
The resolution passed 58 to 4, with one member abstaining.
Should Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union successfully win official union recognition, it will join Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers under Local 5118 of the organization’s parent union, UAW, after negotiating its first contract with the University.
HUWU publicly launched its unionization campaign in late January and began collecting union cards on March 4.
“I strongly support affiliation because I think it is a strong show of solidarity with student employees that are often left out of the union conversation,” HGSU-UAW President Koby D. Ljunggren wrote in an email following the vote. “Undergraduates occupy so many of the day-to-day jobs on campus — including teaching and research — and I think it’s paramount that we shift the conversation.”
“I’m ecstatic with the result,” they added.
Once affiliated, HGSU-UAW and HUWU would share an executive committee — charged with managing union finances, membership, and strike authorization votes — while maintaining separate union statuses and separate contract negotiations with the University.
If officially recognized, HUWU members would be able to run for positions on the executive board, including treasurer, sergeant-at-arms, and trustees.
“The decisions on all of this come so far down the line that it’s not super clear, but it would basically be like a merging of the two of us in a governing way,” HUWU organizer Syd D. Sanders ’24 said. “But we would continue to have two separate collective bargaining agreements with Harvard.”
Until the conclusion of their first contract negotiations, HGSU-UAW will provide financial support to HUWU during the unionization campaign.
“The extent of the financial support we and the broader International UAW will provide depends on how the University administration reacts to the campaign,” Ljunggren wrote. “Obviously, we urge the University to be neutral and voluntarily recognize whatever unit petitions for recognition.”
“It would be a damn shame if the University chooses to follow the same route they took with the HGSU campaign — antagonistic and hostile,” Ljunggren added.
HUWU previously voted to affiliate with the UAW through HGSU-UAW before discussing the proposal with graduate student union members at a closed town hall March 8.
“We know them. We like them. It makes sense,” Sanders said. “They are other student workers on campus and they have a lot of resources and experiences as a more recently unionized campaign that we can utilize easily.”
During the meeting, HUWU members presented their pitch and answered questions from HGSU-UAW members in attendance.
“There are some people with concerns and doubts, but I think there’s many more people who are really excited about the potential to organize together and to share resources,” Sanders said.
Before the meeting, HGSU-UAW member Evan C. MacKay ’19 said that affiliation “seems to be the most stable way of supporting” HUWU.
“Already the impact HUWU has had is tremendous,” they added.
HGSU-UAW Trustee Max G. Ehrenfreund wrote in an email that affiliating with HUWU could convince more undergraduate workers to join the union, as HGSU-UAW has had “difficulty persuading eligible undergraduates to join.” Still, helping the undergraduate unionization campaign would “involve a substantial commitment of time and resources.”
“HGSU’s own organizers and staff are stretched thin, and our financial resources are limited,” Ehrenfreund wrote. “We might have to appeal to the International UAW for temporary staff or legal support.”
Ehrenfreund declined to comment on his personal position on affiliation.
Outgoing HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member Ash E. Tomaszewski said they were initially “a little bit hesitant” about the affiliation with HUWU.
“I think my impression of the unit, HUWU, was going to be larger than it is,” they said. “But when I looked at the actual size of the unit, they are 200 to 300 workers compared to our 5,000-ish worker unit. I’m not so much concerned about substantial shift in our union politics or priorities.”
Sanders estimated HUWU and HGSU-UAW will become officially affiliated in “a couple of” years.
“I look forward to the powerful potential we can reach together as one local union,” Ljunggren wrote.

Amid national controversy surrounding Advanced Placement African American Studies, Cambridge Public School Committee unanimously passed a motion reemphasizing the district’s commitment to the course at a meeting Tuesday.
The College Board introduced the AP course this year, after a decade of development by teachers and professors around the country. Harvard professors Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, who teach the Introduction to African American Studies course at Harvard, advised the development of the AP course.
Gates praised the course in an interview with Inside Higher Ed, saying it “provides students with a firm foundation of facts and evidence about this extraordinarily rich saga of American history.”
The AP course was introduced in the 2022-2023 school year, with Cambridge Rindge and Latin School being one of 60 chosen to pilot the program. Grace K. Clemente — a CRLS student and representative on the Committee who introduced the motion reiterating CPS’ support for the curriculum — was one of the first students to take the course last semester.
“I think it was probably one of the most, if not the most amazing courses, I’ve ever taken in my life,” Clemente said.
The Florida Department of Education wrote a letter to the College Board on Jan. 12 stating that the AP African American Studies course “lacks educational value,” a belief which Clemente said was “egregious.”
After hearing about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ plan to ban the course in Florida public schools, Clemente was motivated to bring the motion to the committee alongside fellow student representative, Adelina R. Escamilla-Salomon.
“There’s so much value that goes into this course, and so much intentionality behind creating the course, that I think it was really, really a huge step forward,” Clemente said.
During the meeting’s public comment portion, some CRLS students also said they support the motion. Helen Hailemariam, who took the course last semester, said many students including herself were “brought to tears” during a classroom discussion following DeSantis’ statements.
“Over the course of the semester, the class not only became a space for learning about history that was representative of my lived experiences, but also a space where I could express my fullest self,” Hailemariam added.
David J. Weinstein, a member of the School Committee and parent to two CPS students, said the student’s commitment to the course was “really clear” and that the course “stands out as a really welcoming place.”
“I think this really shows the power of an inclusive curriculum,” Weinstein added. “You certainly can’t understand American history if you don’t understand Black history — you can’t understand world history if you don’t understand Black history.”
School Committee member Ayesha M. Wilson said she stands “in solidarity” with the motion as a Black educator. During the meeting, Wilson recounted a time when she was reading a book with eighth graders in a classroom and said her students were not familiar with the full extent of Black history and believed it started merely with “slavery.”
“Our history does not start with slavery,” Wilson said. “And there’s just so much more that our young people need to know.”
José Luiz Rojas Villareal, a member of the School Committee, proposed expanding the motion to include an Ethnic Studies curriculum — an amendment that was successfully adopted.
After more than an hour of public comment and discussion, the entire motion was passed unanimously.
While Clemente said the motion’s passage is a positive step, she added that it is important that School Committee members continue to uplift student voices and extend their commitment to African American studies beyond this singular vote.
“How are we going to work towards this beyond just passing this motion — beyond today?” she asked. “What are we going to do, what steps are we going to take to really see this start, to really make an impact?”
Escamilla-Salomon said this motion presents the Committee with an opportunity to advance the diversity of experiences within CPS classrooms and AP curricula.
“When you feel represented in a classroom, when you feel represented by history, by the story that’s being told, you’ll show up,” Escamilla-Salomon said.

New Hampshire Governor Chris T. Sununu said the state will retain its “first in the nation primary” in 2024 — despite an overhaul of the Democratic National Committee’s primary calendar — at an Institute of Politics JFK Jr. Forum Tuesday evening.
In February, the DNC unanimously approved dramatic changes to the order in which states vote in Democratic primaries and elevated South Carolina to the first position, leaving New Hampshire second in voting.
The DNC has given New Hampshire until June to change its primary date, but Sununu and the New Hampshire State Assembly, including Democrats, said they will not cave to the DNC’s pressure.
“The first in the nation primary is not moving for the Democrats,” said Sununu, who is a Republican.
“It’ll be really interesting to see how it plays out, but we’re going first whether they like it or not,” he added.
Sununu said he received a letter from the DNC, which requested Sununu and the legislature affirm that New Hampshire would vote second.
In a “cordial but firm and snarky” letter responding to the DNC, Sununu said he “laid it out” to both President Joe Biden and the DNC that he would not budge.
“You’re crazy,” Sununu said. “I dare you — come and take it.”
He also disputed the DNC’s justification of elevating states with greater racial diversity for the decision to place the South Carolina primary ahead of New Hampshire.
“They have barely 15 percent voter participation. What’s the point of diversity if you don’t encourage people to get out and vote?” Sununu said.
Sununu alleged political foul play by Biden, describing the President placing South Carolina — the state that turned around his path to the nomination — as “blatant personal political payback to his friends.”
“That’s the worst reason to pick a state to have such political and electoral responsibility,” Sununu said.
“I think Biden has made a horrendous mistake,” he added.
Sununu said he does not believe Biden will be the Democratic nominee in 2024.
“Whether I get into the race or not is a different story,” Sununu said.
Sununu believes that with New Hampshire going ahead with the Democratic primary, Biden will be vulnerable to a challenge from another candidate, suggesting Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker as a threat.
“So anybody, especially if somebody has a lot of money, maybe even a little name ID, could come to New Hampshire, get people excited, be on the ground, and probably win that primary,” Sununu said.
When asked about the New Hampshire state motto, “Live Free or Die,” Sununu described it as more than “four words on a license plate.”
“‘Live Free or Die’ is at the heart of what we are. It is about local government, local control, limited government, low taxes, individual responsibility.” Sununu said.
“My job is to create as many doors of opportunity for you, your family, your kids, your business — as many doors,” he added. “And then you do you. Live free or die.”
Sununu remarked on the connection between the state motto and his decision not to move New Hampshire’s primary date.
“That’s why the first in the nation primary can never be duplicated anywhere else — because we have these fundamentals that are all based in ‘Live Free or Die,’” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2023, at 12:51 p.m.
As roughly 100 protesters rallied on the steps of the Cambridge City Hall Annex Tuesday, city leaders met with local activists after months of demonstrations over the police killing of Sayed Faisal.
Three representatives from the city of Cambridge — City Manager Yi-An Huang ’05, Interim Director of the Community Safety Department Elizabeth M. Speakman, and Director of Communications and Community Relations Lee Gianetti — sat down with four organizers from the Boston Party for Socialism and Liberation and 13 local students to discuss their concerns.
Faisal, a Bangladeshi American student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, was fatally shot by Cambridge Police on Jan. 4. According to CPD, Faisal approached officers wielding a knife following a five-block chase. When a non-lethal sponge round failed to stop him, an officer shot and killed him.
In the months since, protesters have alleged police brutality and racism in Cambridge’s police department and reiterated demands for the city to name, fire, and prosecute the officers involved, as well as release the full unredacted police report.
Little progress was made on these points, according to Party for Socialism and Liberation organizer Joe Tache, who participated in the meeting and called the talks “frustrating.”
“Unfortunately, the city wasn’t willing to make any movement on the demands right now,” Tache said.
City officials have maintained they will release the names of the officers involved and the police report only after the completion of an ongoing investigation by the Middlesex District Attorney.
In a statement Wednesday morning, Huang said the city and activists have a “shared urgency” on police reform, but added that he was disappointed in the Party for Socialism and Liberation’s approach to the meeting.
“I appreciate their passion and activism and the opportunity to have dialogue,” Huang wrote. “I’m disappointed that Boston PSL is only interested in firing police officers without process and was uninterested in conversation about the how to achieve the change we all desire.”
In an interview Tuesday morning, Huang said the city approached the meeting seeking a middle ground with the organizers.
“I have interest in a real conversation and a productive conversation,” he said. “A lot of the direction that they’re pushing in — for police reform, legitimacy, transparency, accountability — those are all things that we’re really committed to.”
“There’s a broader conversation about police reform,” Huang said. “Are the folks who are protesting interested in that or are they just interested in protesting?”
An hour before the meeting, protesters converged on the steps of City Hall to continue a rally that began the previous day. Speakers shared stories of personal encounters with police, led chants of “Justice for Faisal,” and demanded change from CPD and the city of Cambridge.
“One thing that the city manager told us is that he’s gotten advice to wait, and we’ll go away,” Tache told protesters, triggering a wave of boos.
At 5:22 p.m. the crowd of protesters marched to the City Hall Annex, where the meeting between organizers and city officials was taking place. Four CPD motorcycles accompanied them — to the jeers of protesters — and parked across the street at John M. Tobin Elementary School to observe the demonstration.
For nearly two hours, the demonstrators marched in a circle by the entrance of the City Hall Annex, waving signs, singing songs, and chanting “No justice! No peace! No racist police!” “Release the names,” and “This racist system’s got to fall.”
“Negotiations with organizers are going on right now as we speak,” said Meilyn C. Huq, an organizer with the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the demonstration’s emcee. “Let’s make some noise so the city manager can hear the energy in this crowd.”
Despite the lack of action, protesters saw the meeting as a validation of their continued organizing.
“The city manager would have never held a meeting with community organizers if it wasn’t for all the pressure that we have given them,” said Safiyyah Ogundipe, a MIT student who participated in the meeting with the city officials. “We should all be super proud of ourselves.”
Huang said in the interview Tuesday that he is accountable to residents of Cambridge despite his role as an unelected city manager — a feature of Cambridge’s Plan E form of government that activists have called undemocratic.
“I am more accountable in these kinds of circumstances,” he said. “If you look at my contract, ultimately, a majority of city councilors could terminate my contract at any time,” he added.
Tache told the crowd that the demonstrations had already impacted the state of policing in Cambridge, pointing to a series of policing reforms made in the months following Faisal’s death.
“Was Cambridge implementing these body cameras before these protests? Was Cambridge hiring PERF or other consultants about issues of policing before these protests?” Tache asked rallygoers. “These protests are the main reason that any reform is happening in this police department in the first place.”
Amari M. Butler ’25, who spoke at the rally, said that the Tuesday rally evoked “optimism.” Still, she said she wishes “to see more Harvard students engage in the struggle.”
“This happened not very far from Harvard’s campus. It happened in Cambridge,” Butler said. “I have not seen the amount of Harvard people show out as I feel should.”
“This is not the first rally we’ve had. It’s one of many, and it won’t be the last,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All roads have led to this.
After its best regular season campaign since 2016-2017, the No. 7 Harvard men’s ice hockey team will look to kickstart a championship run against the No. 8 Ohio State Buckeyes on Friday afternoon in Bridgeport, Conn.
Behind the bench, the Crimson is steered by Ted Donato ’91, who will make his eighth NCAA tournament appearance in his 19th season as head coach. On the ice, Harvard is captained by three seniors: defenseman Henry Thrun, forward Baker Shore, and forward John Farinacci. Farinacci missed the first half of the season due to injury before returning in January.
“We certainly start the year out with goals and hopes and expectations,” said Donato at the end of the regular season. “We know everybody starts on even footing in the playoffs, and it's always difficult to try to end somebody's season and move on. It's something that we've talked a lot about throughout the year – trying to get ourselves to a point where we could play our best when it mattered the most.”
At forward, the Crimson’s top six is loaded with star power. Junior Sean Farrell, the ECAC Player of the Year, led the team with 52 points (20 goals, 32 assists) on his way to being named a Hobey Baker Award top-10 finalist. Farrell’s linemate, sophomore Matthew Coronato, tallied 20 goals of his own en route to a spot on the All-ECAC Second Team. Junior Alex Laferriere joined Coronato on the Second Team after leading the team with 21 goals, while first-year Joe Miller earned a unanimous spot on the ECAC All-Rookie Team with 28 points (13 goals, 15 assists).
On defense, Harvard is backstopped by Thrun, who won the ECAC Howies Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman Award. First-year Ryan Healey earned a spot alongside Miller on the All-Rookie team, and senior Ryan Siedem and sophomores Ian Moore and Jack Bar provided a steady presence in the top four. In net, senior Mitchell Gibson turned in the finest season of his career, posting career-best marks in goals-against average and save percentage and winning a spot on the All-ECAC Second Team.
“We're definitely a pretty offensive team, but I think we know the kind of style we need to play to win big games,” said Laferriere at the end of the regular season.
Despite the Crimson’s infrequent competition against the Big Ten Conference, the squad still has some familiarity with the Buckeyes, both through recruiting and competition in the USHL, the United States’ top junior hockey league. Ohio State’s attack is led by freshman Stephen Halliday, a draft pick of the NHL’s Ottawa Senators and USHL alum, who tallied 40 points (nine goals, 31 assists) on the season. Halliday and goaltender Jakub Dobes were All-Big Ten honorable mentions, while forwards Jake Wise and Mason Lohrei, the squad’s second and third leading scorers, respectively, were named to the All-Big Ten Second Team.
“There are a lot of their players that we have some familiarity with as far as recruiting goes and watching other college games during the season…but certainly not a team that we are familiar with from a style standpoint,” Donato said. “That's something that we'll get on the video and on the phone and figure out what makes them successful.”
Ohio State’s game pounds opposing goalies with shots, as the Buckeyes average over 36 shots on goal per game while conceding under 29 per game. Ohio State’s penalty kill is the best unit in the country, shutting down opposing power plays at an eye-popping 89.5% clip. However, the Buckeyes are also one of the weakest faceoff teams in the nation, with their faceoff win percentage of 47.8% ranking 44th out of 60 teams.
Ohio State began the season with two-game sweeps of Mercyhurst and Wisconsin before getting blown out 6-1 by UConn on Oct. 15. The Buckeyes responded with a sweep of Bentley before splitting a two-game set with the University of Minnesota, the NCAA Tournament’s top overall seed. After a stretch of four losses in five games, the team got back into top form with a road victory over Penn State on Dec. 3, kicking off a run of six straight wins that culminated in a victory over the Michigan Wolverines, the tournament’s second overall seed. The Buckeyes ended their regular season with a sweep at the hands of Minnesota, but they rebounded to advance to the Big Ten Tournament semifinal, where they lost 7-3 to the Wolverines.
The Crimson began the season with seven consecutive wins, including six over ECAC competition. The stretch matched the program’s best start to a season since 1989, when Harvard won its only national championship. In a trend that defined the Crimson’s campaign, the squad overcame deficits in three of its early wins, rebounding from slow starts to top Dartmouth, Princeton, and RPI.
After a perfect 7-0-0 start on the East Coast, Harvard headed to the midwest for a two-game set against then-No. 5 Michigan, an out-of-conference foe loaded with NHL-caliber talent. After battling to a 4-4 draw in the first game, the Crimson suffered its first defeat of the season the next night, falling 4-1 to the Wolverines despite putting up 40 shots on goal. However, Harvard responded to the defeat less than a week later, claiming a 2-1 overtime victory on the road at Cornell’s Lynah Rink, with ECAC Player of the Year Sean Farrell scoring the game-winner. The next night, the Crimson were stymied by Colgate goaltender Carter Gylander, whose 36 saves preserved a 6-4 victory for the Raiders, sending Harvard into the midseason break with a record of 8-2-1.
“It’s a pretty resilient group,” Donato said. “We've won some games in overtime, we've had some comebacks, we've had some injuries throughout the year, so we've had all sorts of people step up under those conditions.”
The Crimson returned to play on Dec. 30 at Boston University’s Walter Brown Arena for a top-10 showdown with the Terriers. In a goaltending duel between Gibson and BU Olympian Drew Commesso, the Terriers emerged with a 2-1 overtime victory after a goal from captain Domenick Fensore. The Crimson responded again with a strong victory, throttling Northeastern 8-4 at home on New Year’s Day. The next weekend, Harvard’s habit of slow starts and lead-chasing reared its head again. Despite erasing a three-goal third period deficit in an overtime victory over Princeton, the Crimson couldn’t pull off the same trick the next night in a 4-1 loss to No. 2 Quinnipiac, as the Bobcats’ impenetrable defensive structure and goaltending suffocated the Harvard offense.
After a 5-1 mid-January stretch against ECAC competition, including a thrilling 3-2 overtime victory over Yale and a 5-4 comeback win in overtime against Colgate, the Crimson got another shot at the ECAC-leading Bobcats on Feb. 3, but Quinnipiac emerged victorious yet again. Star goaltender Yaniv Perets, the ECAC Goaltender of the Year and a top-10 finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, posted a 25-save shutout, while Harvard’s potent power play was shut out on its three chances in the 3-0 loss.
Despite the loss to the Bobcats, the Crimson entered February’s Beanpot Tournament with an excellent opportunity to secure its first trophy in six years. In its semifinal bout with the Boston College Eagles, Harvard got out to a 2-0 start and held a 3-1 lead late in the third period before Eagles forwards Nikita Nesterenko and Cutter Gauthier scored in the final five minutes to send the game to overtime. Despite being outshot 22-2 in the final period, the Crimson regrouped, and in the dying seconds of the three-on-three extra session, first-year forward Marek Hejduk hammered home the game-winner on his first overtime shift of the season, sending Harvard to the championship game.
In a tight and emotional Beanpot title game, the Crimson and the Northeastern Huskies fought to a 2-2 draw after 65 minutes of play, sending the game to the first decisive shootout in Beanpot history. Star Harvard forwards Farrell, Coronato, and Laferriere couldn’t beat Huskies goaltender Devon Levi in the first three rounds, while Northeastern captain Aidan McDonough scored the shootout’s only goal, winning the Beanpot for the Huskies.
Despite the heartbreaking defeat, the Crimson rebounded to sweep its final four ECAC games to secure the conference’s second postseason seed, guaranteeing a first-round bye and a home series in the quarterfinals. After emerging from its two week break, Harvard swept Princeton in two 6-1 victories to advance to the semifinals against Cornell in Lake Placid, N.Y. In the season’s third faceoff between the archrivals, the Crimson emerged with its third victory, as Laferriere broke a scoreless tie five minutes into overtime to move Harvard to the championship against Colgate.
“I think it was more than half the games we gave up the first goal, and obviously it's good to know that we can come back in those situations, but I think it's super important to get that first goal, especially at a national tournament game,” Farinacci said.
The Crimson got off to another slow start against the Raiders, conceding two first period goals before Thrun cut the deficit in half in the second. Colgate answered immediately to restore a two goal advantage, and despite a power play goal from Coronato midway through the period, Harvard couldn’t find the equalizer, and the Crimson ultimately fell one win short of defending its ECAC title.
Despite the tough end to the conference playoffs, Farinacci is motivated to get Harvard into a position to win a trophy after falling just short throughout the season thus far.
“We've come short in the Ivy League, we've come short in the ECAC, obviously in the Beanpot, so there's one trophy left to get, and from here on out, it's win or go home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard track and field team sent six athletes to the NCAA championship meet in Albuquerque, N.M. on March 10 and 11. The Crimson saw great success, earning eight team honors as well as an individual award.
“I think the big thing is really just the standard of excellence is obviously the highest that we see throughout the year,” said head coach Jason Sarestky about the caliber of the NCAA meet in comparison to previous meets. “Event after event, there’s just such a high level of performance, and it was great to see so many Harvard student-athletes competing at that level.”
Up first, sophomore Izzy Goudros competed for Harvard in the women’s pentathlon, placing eleventh. Goudros set a new personal best in the 60 m hurdles with a time of 8.41 seconds, which puts her third in the record books for the event. She also ran a personal best in the 800 m with a time of 2:17.78 seconds, ending the event with a score of 4165 points.
Her teammate sophomore Kenneth Ikeji took tenth place in the men’s weight throw. His first throw, a mark of 21.92 m, was the best he threw that day. His teammate, senior Alexander Kolesnikoff, finished twelfth in the men’s shot put, throwing at 19.64 m, both earning Second-Team honors.
On the running side, sophomores Acer Iverson and Graham Blanks ran in the men’s 5000 m race.
“Just to be there is an honor for Acer and I, because once you get there and you race against these people they’re the cream of the crop,” said Blanks about going into the race. “You have to be ready to go, you have to be ready to roll with the punches because the guys you’re racing are incredibly fit and incredibly talented.”
Both runners crossed the finish line almost a second apart. Iverson ran in 14:18.88 seconds, and Blanks came in just behind him at 14:19.55 seconds, placing them in 12th and 13th places, respectively.
“It’s really cool,” said Blanks about competing alongside his teammate.“It’s kind of a dream of ours to do that for a while. We took a gap year together in 2020-2021, back when we weren’t nearly where we are now. I think we both thought it’d be pretty cool to have not only one, but multiple Harvard jerseys on the line at a track championship, because personally we’ve never seen that before from Harvard in the years we’ve been running. So it felt like a pretty big deal to go out and do that with Acer.”
Junior Maia Ramsden took fourth in her heat of the mile in the preliminaries, qualifying with a time of 4:40.16 seconds.
On day two, Ramsden, the school record holder for the indoor women’s mile, placed fifth overall in the nation for the event, running a time of 4:36.54 seconds. Her race earned her First-Team Honors, as well as a spot on the podium. About an hour after the mile, Ramsden was back on the podium for the women’s 3000 m run, earning eighth place with a time of 9:16.99 seconds.
Blanks competed in the 3000 m run as well, finishing in 13th place with a time of 8:10.11 seconds. This placed him three spots higher than his initial ranking going into championships.
Ramsden was also the recipient of the 2023 Elite 90 Award for the NCAA Championship. The Elite 90 award is given to a student athlete who excels both in academics as well as their sport. Ramsden held the highest cumulative GPA out of all other female competitors at the meet.
“I was incredibly proud of Maia,” said Sarestky. “She certainly is the epitome of a student athlete, pursuing academic and athletic excellence, and for her to have that recognition in front of her peers was just a testament to her hard work and how dedicated she is as a student athlete.”
The team has also received several USTFCCCA Northeast Regional Awards, which were announced on March 16th. This put Harvard at second place in the nation for the number of regional awards, tying it with NCAA champions University of Arkansas.
“Just really proud of our program,” said Sarestky about the awards the Crimson won this season. “The individual student athletes do a tremendous job with their work ethic and their dedication, and so it was great to see the other coaches in the Northeast recognizing our student-athletes and the same for our two assistant coaches that were recognized.”
The Men’s Field Athlete of the Year was given to Ikeji, who won the Ivy League men’s weight throw, throwing a personal best of 22.64 m. Ikeji also happens to be the current school record holder for the men’s weight throw.
Ramsden was the recipient of the Women’s Track and Field Athlete of the Year. Ramsden was the mile and 1000 m champion at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and she also set the school record this indoor season in the mile with a time of 4:30.19 seconds, the 1000 m with 2:43.03 seconds, and the 3000 m with 9:16.99 seconds.
“Not surprised,” said Blanks about Ramsden’s award. “Maia is an incredible runner, and I don’t really see many people in the Northeast able to compete with her right now – she’s just a level above.”
The Women’s Field Athlete of the Year was senior Stephanie Ratcliffe, the Ivy League and Harvard record holder in the women’s weight throw. Out of the five weight throw events she competed in this year, she came out victorious in four of them.
Along with athletes, coaches also received honors from the Regional Awards.
Marc Mangiacotti won the Men’s Assistant Coach of the Year. In his 11th season with the Crimson, his athletes accounted for 92 out of 163 points that Harvard earned at the Ivy League Championships. His team of sprinters, hurdlers, and jumpers won seven events at the Heptagonal Championships and broke three school records.
The Women’s Assistant Coach award went to Alex Gibby, a sixth year associate head coach of the program.
Saretsky, the recipient of the Ivy League Women’s Indoor Track and Field Coach of the Year award, was also granted the honor of Women’s Coach of the Year. In his 17th season, he sent the most athletes to the NCAAs.
“I really feel like that’s a credit to our program,” said Sarestky in reference to his award. “It’s really the entire coaching staff and our student athletes that deserve all the credit and praise for it.”
During the season, a number of athletes also made some history.
At the Scarlet and White meet at Boston University, first year Vivien Henz, a native of Luxembourg, set a new indoor mile record for his country with a time of 3:57.47 seconds, a full ten seconds faster than the previous record. At the same meet, Blanks also ran a 3:56.63 mile to set the Ivy League and Harvard record.
Pole vaulter sophomore Anastasia Retsa set a school record of 4.17 m at the BU Valentine Invite in early February, being the only athlete at the meet to clear 3.90 m. Senior John Minicus also represented the Crimson as the sole competitor for the program at the ICAC/ECAC championships, breaking the men’s pentathlon record earlier this March.
Sophomore Victoria Bossong set the new school record for the 500m run with a time of 1:10.23 seconds. She then went on to break the 4x400m relay record for Harvard and the Ivy League alongside Goudros, senior Tina Martin, and sophomore Chloe Fair at the Tiger Paw Invite in early February. The men’s team joined them to also beat some records, with first year Jonas Clarke and sophomore Lance Ward breaking the 60 m and 200 m dash record in times of 6.71 seconds and 21.07 seconds respectively.
Moving forward, the Crimson will continue its outdoor season after opening at the University of Houston Spring Break Invite meet this past Thursday.

Housing Day is one of the most celebrated days at Harvard. It can be both exciting and stressful. After the stress of navigating blocking and linking groups, we scale walls and sneak around HUPD into each of the nine river houses, desperately trying to win the favor of the River Gods. Although there are many myths and preconceived notions about each house, here are my post-housing day realizations.
River Run is a hoax
Many people carry the belief that River Run saved them from the tragedy of being quadded to their grave. However, from personal experience, this is not true. I was a firm believer that River Run was do or die: If you don’t do it, have fun walking the extra 15 minutes to the yard. If you weren’t going to do it, then you were strictly cut out of the blocking group (can’t have dead weight on the team). Against my deepest wishes, some of my blockmates did not participate in River Run activities… and despite my nightmares of C-A-B-O-T being yelled up our stairs the next morning, we were pleasantly surprised with the screams of C-A-B-O-T followed by A-D-A-M-S. And, let's not forget about our fallen soldiers who correctly “River Ran” and unfortunately still got quadded.
Don’t stir up shit within your blocking group
Please, don’t be the group that already has blocking drama without even having lived together. Just imagine what your life will be like in six months, when you’re sharing a room and living side by side, if you’re already having issues now!
Please, no blockcest (you don't need any new members in your blocking group)
As seen on Sidechat, pregnancies are on the rise (some discovered in Lamont Library, others maybe in Cabot, or Widener). Don’t let one of these be from the intricacies of your blocking group. Blocking groups should be sacred spaces with as little drama as possible. Adding a baby to the crew could ruin the group dynamic… or, I suppose, it could potentially unite everyone to work together to raise a child that is already a double legacy! Just beware of dirty diapers, throw up, and the cries you might encounter around the clock. But then again, also keep in mind the endless excuses for why that assignment that was due last night was not submitted on time ;)
Beware of spring breaking with the blocking group
Watch out for the potential consequences of vacationing with your blocking group. Just know that you will have the next three years to spend time with these people. Maybe spring break is the perfect chance to truly get a real break from Harvard and its people… Don’t let spring break leave you, and the blocking group, spring broken :(
The river is not always sunshine and rainbows…
Being quadded is not all that bad. Currier’s housing video was the most revolutionary housing video of all time, and as seen on Sidechat, it even started the Quad Renaissance! There are debates about introducing “Quad Runs” to get quadded, because “THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.” Even if you get quadded, keep in mind that the walk is only 15 minutes, which is a shorter walk than what most state school students endure. I’ve never seen a Sidechat post about a Pfoho or Currier rat invasion; Eliot and Kirkland, on the other hand, suffer constant infestations. #countyourblessings!
Although blocking and Housing Day may have been anxiety inducing, everyone ends up loving their house and never even considers transferring (most of the time, at least).
