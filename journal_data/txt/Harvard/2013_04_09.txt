After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several of our canon’s most prized works of literature are about rape. I struggled with that fact in two humanities courses this semester as I delved into Ovid’s ancient collection “Metamorphoses” and W.B. Yeats’s 1923 poem “Leda and the Swan.” “Metamorphoses” features one mythological female after the next enduring or evading rape, while “Leda and the Swan” graphically describes the Greek god Zeus raping a woman while disguised as a swan. Both works are gorgeously composed and offer much more, of course, than rape-centric plots. But in my professors’ and classmates’ eagerness to discuss the intellectual genius behind these texts, the topic of rape has been avoided or glazed over without the care the subject necessitates.
I’m troubled by this casual treatment of rape for two reasons.
The first is obvious: any student sitting around the table could have experienced sexual violence. Brushing over the issue of rape in literature to discuss Yeats’s sonnet composition or Ovid’s layered narrative shows indifference to the experiences and emotions of these students. While literature courses should certainly focus on literary topics, students shouldn’t be made to feel that scholarship excludes or trivializes an issue that already breeds on invisibility.
The second reason I’m bothered is that I fear the same attitude driving these academic conversations (an attitude that devalues the importance and validity of rape) also drives the minimization of rape in our culture.
The parallels aren’t hard to draw. Questioning the presence of rape in “Leda and the Swan” (in class we learned that Leda’s rape might truly be seduction) sounds eerily at home with the skepticism that rape victims face every day. How many times do we hear rape victims’ allegations questioned by lawyers, judges, even policemen? Likewise, claiming that rape isn’t the core issue in “Leda and the Swan” (the heart of the poem, we learn, is the fall of Troy) echoes much scarier claims about the role of rape in current events. The same evasive logic tells us that the Steubenville case is about the dangers of alcohol and the ruination of two young men—not, as it happens, rape. Perhaps worst of all, conventionalizing rape in Ovid’s book (the males “can’t control themselves,” students say) feeds into the harmful perception that rape is an inevitable crime.
One of the touchstones of humanities at Harvard is the development of students’ critical thinking skills. Undergraduates are encouraged to look at the world with the same acuity they use to analyze literature. The English Department even names “ethical deliberation” as a key component of its concentration. But what kind of ethical deliberation do these discussions of rape impart to students? It pains me to think that Harvard courses could foster the same mindset of skepticism and judgment that still pervades real-life rape culture. Because I want this pattern to change, I’ve thought hard about approaches that professors could adopt to create a more aware classroom environment.
My first suggestion to professors is to start class with a disclaimer. Let your students know upfront that you will be discussing a text involving rape. Encourage students to speak their minds, but ask them to participate with awareness and sensitivity. You can explain how your scholarly approach contends with the presence of rape in the text, and you can invite your students to office hours if they have concerns.
In a similar vein, my second suggestion is to save 10 minutes of class to talk about the relationship between the text and modern views on rape. There are many secondary sources—essays on gender theory or historical documents—that examine relevant issues: How does our present-day attitude toward rape affect the way we respond to the text? How is it reductive or illuminating to characterize the text by its representation of rape? How should historical perceptions of rape inform our understanding of the text?
My final suggestion to Humanities faculty is to consider offering a course on the issue of rape and literature. I know that the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Department already addresses these concerns, but I think such a course could also find a home in Classics, English, Literature, and History & Literature. A fascinating syllabus could be written on the contention that mythological rape might inform 21st century rape culture. Better yet, this type of course would promote candid reflection on academic attitudes toward rape.
I’m fully confident that Harvard can make simple changes to reshape the way that rape is discussed in Humanities courses. We’ve successfully overcome similar hurdles in the past. Our courses offer well-informed readings of literature with racist undertones, and we have developed thoughtful methods for discussing post-colonialism, anti-Semitism, classism, even sexism—but not, it seems, sexual violence. Rape should be included in the ranks of literary complexities most deserving of attention. I know that Harvard is capable of doing better, and now is the time to start.

I watch NBC’s musical television series “Smash” every single week. But judging from its recent switch from Tuesday to Saturday night airings, I may be the last one doing so. About halfway through its first season, once-hopeful critics abandoned constructive criticism for “hate-watching” the show, focusing the majority of their reviews on mocking the absurd scarves Debra Messing’s character Julia wore to appear playwright-ly. The network fired then-showrunner Theresa Rebeck at the end of last season, replacing her with TV veteran and former “Gossip Girl” showrunner Josh Safran. And while “Smash” version 2.0 still isn’t good by “Mad Men” standards, it’s created a new vision for the series with much lower aims which, for the most part, it seems to achieve.
Old “Smash” had lofty goals. The brainchild of Steven Spielberg, the show focused on the creation of a fictional Broadway musical. It was originally purchased by current NBC Chairman Robert Greenblatt at his previous post at premium cable network Showtime, home to critically acclaimed series like “Weeds” and “Homeland.” Though “Smash” inevitably took on a different tone when Greenblatt moved the project to NBC, it was still poised to become an acclaimed network drama. And early on, critics had hope. It had flaws from the start, but reached legitimately cathartic moments. Episodes came together in songs that deftly captured the struggles of being young and confused and trying to make the dream work. But as the series continued, Rebeck ignored the most compelling aspects of the show, focusing instead on an array of storylines featuring Julia’s relationship with her son Leo, a pointlessly whiney, emotional teenager who is possibly the worst written character in television history, and Ellis, a scheming young assistant who ruins everyone’s lives just for the sake of being an annoying, evil human being. The great moments that “Smash” could achieve occurred with less and less frequency.
With the network’s attempts to abandon this legacy, a lot weighed on Safran’s new reboot this past February. In the first few episodes, he swiftly wrote off the problematic characters from season one (read: Leo, Ellis), and replaced them with a set of young, hip Brooklynites that over the course of the season come together to work on a second, edgier musical to compete with season one’s Marilyn Monroe biopic “Bombshell.” The new season is much cleaner and it has less (though not zero) random elements and characters with nonsensical motivations. But critics have remained unimpressed. In the best moments of season one, “Smash” could be an interesting and empathetic look into young artists’ lives, examining passion and disappointment through a fresh lense. The TV series of which critics and viewers dreamed, the one full of these moments, is still nowhere to be found in Safran’s re-envisioning.
But if evaluating a show means considering how close it comes to achieving its aims, I wonder if some of “Smash” 2.0’s flack would disappear if we divorced it from the goals of the show’s initial season. Old “Smash” aimed for a lot, and it got muddled in the process; new “Smash” aims for much less, and it comes closer to hitting its mark. The show is not meant to be an accurate window into the Broadway world; see, for example, the way the term “dramaturg” has been used this entire season to refer to people who doctor scripts. It’s definitely not an attempt to achieve any kind of subtle resonance.
What the second season of “Smash” basically aims to be is “Gossip Girl” plus songs. And I can appreciate that. “Gossip Girl” had Blair scheming to take enemies down, scandalous exposes shaking the Upper East Side, and love triangles (Blair, Dan, Chuck/Serena, Dan, Nate) coming to head amid people running around black-tie masquerade balls. “Smash” has rival musicals competing against each other, melodramatic casting switcharoos, love triangles reaching across generational lines, and Krysta Rodriguez singing fun songs in spunky outfits. Sometimes we want to watch television to change and challenge our perspectives. But other times we just want to get lost in fake people’s lives and listen to great singers belt high notes in the process.
If “Smash” wants to be the best version of this particular vision for the show (like, for example, the first season of “Gossip Girl,” its obvious peak), there are a few clear moves it can make. It should focus on sharpening its romantic elements, especially the relationship between Karen and Jimmy (played by newcomer Jeremy Jordan). Jeremy is the least compelling of Safran’s additions, huffing and puffing his way through each episode, demanding veteran treatment though he’s working on his first off-Broadway show. Karen’s feelings for him motivate multiple season two storylines, but his lack of appeal makes it difficult to understand what exactly she finds so magnetic. In “Gossip Girl,” the believable, slow burn of Blair and Dan’s will-they won’t-they relationship sustained viewers even through a season of 19-year old Chuck unearthing the mystery of his father’s death by trailing clues surrounding an underground high-class escort ring. A compelling relationship seems something within “Smash” 2.0’s reach and it could carry us through even the more ridiculous points of contention in its Broadway storylines, like new character Scott’s 15-year grudge against Julia for taking a career opportunity that any realistic human being would have taken in her place. But even if the show doesn’t manage to fix its romantic elements, it has one consistent thing going for it that “Gossip Girl” could never have: that Megan Hilty sure can sing.

Tyler, The Creator is a controversial figure by anyone’s estimation. From his first album, 2009’s “BASTARD,” to its followup, “GOBLIN,” the frontman of the alternative hip-hop collective Odd Future has been the subject of both plaudits and pointed accusations of homophobia and misogyny. It is not difficult to see why—his work has been cutting-edge in hip-hop, but also heavily peppered with pejorative epithets and ultra-violent imagery. On “WOLF,” the third installment in the trilogy, Tyler moves beyond the shock and awe to more fully develop his talent for production and storytelling, creating an album that is both intimate and powerful. 
 
Tyler’s dramatics and big narratives are among his most striking characteristics in a music scene that is becoming increasingly inundated with hook- and beat-centric productions. Tyler delves fearlessly into himself with numerous, conflicted alter-egos and spins his deepest worries into grand schemes, creating songs that strike on levels both low and lofty. Tyler uses his characters to create tension and drama that he mines to great effect on songs like “IFHY.” As his personas, Sam and Wolf, compete for the affection of Sam’s girlfriend Slater, Sam struggles with feelings of envy, rage, and love. As featured artist Pharrell Williams sings, “Love, love, love,” Tyler is stating, “Look. I wanna strangle you, ‘til you stop breathing / Spend the rest of my life looking for air / so you can breathe, or we can die together, you and me.” The song is punctuated by pointed pauses in the beat, which is mainly composed of pulses and sharp stabs of synth. The production drives home each of Tyler’s declarations of love and hate with force, lending his lyrics a level of believability beyond what his vocal delivery could accomplish alone.
 
The story of Camp Flog Gnaw unfolds slowly over the course of “WOLF,” but this overarching narrative feels secondary to several songs’ piecemeal confessions from Tyler. When Tyler croons on “Awkward” in a darkly pitched-down voice alongside Frank Ocean, it is easy to forget for a moment that he is speaking as Sam. On this track, Tyler raps about love after-the-fact, shifting from “Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked / You officially put my feelings inside a ziplock bag,” to “But by the time you hear this, you won’t know what these rhymes meant / But when you find out, it’s awkward, your name’s still my password / So I’m always fucking reminded.” Hearing this, it is not Sam’s characterization that feels most memorable, but rather that the candid words seem to come from some part of the true Tyler, whatever part that may be.
 
A feeling that seems to plague many of Tyler’s numerous personas is angst over his father’s absence. “Answer” is a rare tender piece from Tyler wherein he allows the listener a glimpse behind his wall of aggression to see the pillars of uncertainty holding up his front. Drifting out of a haze of organ and a hypnotically sweet guitar melody, Tyler rails against his absentee father, “Mom was only 20 when you ain’t have any fucks to spare / you Nigerian fuck, now I’m stuck with this shitty facial hair,” much like he did on “Inglorious” from “BASTARD.” But where “Inglorious” was an unblinking song of spite, “Answer” ends that same verse with a heartbreaking line, “But if I ever had the chance to ask this nigga / and call him…” followed by the hook, “I hope you answer / Because when I call (When I call, baby) / I hope you pick up your phone (Please pick up) / I’d like to talk to you. / I hope you answer.”
 
The best moments on “WOLF” are those in which Tyler allows his own voice to shine through the pretense of his personas and blood-soaked ethos. “Answer” is a genuinely touching track, and “Colossus” is a truly powerful piece of lyricism in which Tyler skewers the mindset of obsessive, maniacal fans. In the song, a fan approaches Tyler at Six Flags and says, “I got your pics on my wall / With the mouth cut out, now papercuts on my balls.” The song has undeniable similarities to Eminem’s masterpiece “Stan,” but the pressing piano chords and the ominous hum of strings add an air of tension that make “Colossus” a sincerely stirring piece of autobiography.
 
“WOLF” has all the trappings of a Tyler, The Creator album, with its darkness, sinister lyrics, and extended narrative arcs. Where this album pushes his artistic oeuvre is in its focus on musicality—Tyler produced every song on the album, and his voice is as evident in every twinkling chime on “Treehome95” as it is in his screams of  “Wolf Gang, up in this bitch.” The most important feature of this album is Tyler’s increasing willingness to explore themes in great depth and with greater gravitas. Behind all of Tyler’s smartly dismal production and sharply distasteful lyrics, there has always been a hugely talented, if troubled, musician, and this is evident on “WOLF” more than on any other album.

On Thursday morning, my plan was to write this article about Tyga. I wasn’t entirely sure where it would go; the initial impetus had something to do with timing, how the announcement dovetailed with public outcry over the verdict in the Steubenville rape trial. If I had an extra column, I might still have written that. But at 3:41 p.m., something much more pressing came up.
On Thursday afternoon, Roger Ebert, a revered film critic and a personal idol, died at the age of 70.
As an avid reader of Ebert’s website—it’s only a slight exaggeration to say I read almost every review he wrote last year—I was very startled to read the news. He had always struck me almost as an institution, so much so that the loss feels strangely personal. His catalogue of reviews, from his very first piece on Federico Fellini’s “La Dolce Vita” in 1961 (an endorsement of what he later considered one of his favorite films) to his final judgment (three and a half stars for this weekend’s “To the Wonder”), is so extensive that it’s difficult to imagine future films hitting the silver screen without first passing his judgment.
To describe Ebert simply as a critic is something of an oversimplification. In his 46-year career at the Chicago Sun-Times, he achieved an unprecedented level of regard from all sectors of society. His opinions were held in high esteem by both the intellectual establishment and the moviegoing public; in 1975, he became the first ever film critic to receive a Pulitzer Prize. To me, he was essentially an arbiter of taste for our society: his word always seemed somehow definitive, the quality of a movie encapsulated by the direction of his famous thumbs.
That’s not to say that I always agreed with Ebert’s thoughts on a particular movie, or even on his broader views on film in general. He excoriated “Fight Club” and “The Usual Suspects,” two staples of my personal library; how “Platoon” merited four stars while “Full Metal Jacket” only earned two and a half is beyond me; and I’ll never quite understand what he saw in “The Descendants.” And, perhaps most egregiously, he several times stated that he could not consider video games to be art as a matter of principle. This is perhaps the only viewpoint I considered entirely unfounded, as it flies in the face of several games that I would argue have already established the medium’s artistic legitimacy. But even where these disagreements are at their starkest, his eloquence and insight always left a distinct positive impression.
It’s fitting that Ebert’s rise to prominence coincided so well with that of the “New Hollywood” directors of the 1960s and ’70s, for his contributions to film criticism mirror theirs in directing. For the likes of Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola, and Martin Scorsese, success came in mixing film school tactics, technique, and technology with groundbreaking subject matter, finding equal footing in both critical and commercial sectors. Similarly, I will always consider Ebert’s biggest contribution to be the way he effortlessly blurred the line between criticism and reviews, giving not only a movie’s pros and cons but also a surprisingly thorough analysis that elucidated why its elements had their particular effects.
Through it all, he filled his writing with abundant wit and compassion. He was never afraid to gush about films that were near and dear to him; the enthusiasm he displayed in his many articles on “Citizen Kane” is downright infectious. He frequently found poignant frames through which to express his thoughts on heartwarming movies; his review of “E.T.” upon inaugurating it to his “Great Movie” list, written as a letter to his grandchildren, is truly touching. And his aptly titled books “Your Movies Sucks” and “I Hated Hated Hated this Movie” collect some truly hilarious tirades on some truly terrible films, taking titles from his reviews of “Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo” and “North” (the latter of which is so funny that Jason Alexander mentioning the film during his talk at the Science Center made me laugh so hard that he flipped me off—yes, that was me).
As I look back through his body of work, a piece on one of my personal favorite movies, Hirokazu Kore-Eda’s “After Life,” strikes me as particularly fitting. In the film, which Ebert awarded four stars, the recently deceased are asked to choose their happiest, most meaningful memory, to live in that moment for eternity. In endeavoring to answer the question, Ebert recalls a line from another film, Ingmar Bergman’s “Cries and Whispers”: “I feel a great gratitude to my life, which has given me so much.” We, too, feel a great gratitude for the life of this luminary; Roger Ebert gave the world of film so much that his loss will be felt for years to come.

Is it right to call indie rock band British Sea Power ambitious, or are they just weird? For 10 years, the esoteric band has been praised with reservations for its arcane lyrics and flamboyant performances. In promoting the band’s latest album, “Machineries of Joy,” the lead vocalist, who simply goes by “Yan,” promised more of the same, remarking, “Various things are touched on in the words—Franciscan monks, ketamine, French female bodybuilders turned erotic movie stars.” With this assertion, Yan set up the release to either be fascinating or vaguely disappointing. In the end, “Machineries of Joy” seems to head in the opposite direction of British Sea Power’s positive reputation, as they struggle to keep up with their own opacity.
 
“Machineries of Joy” is not without its moments of clarity. “Loving Animals” is refreshingly catchy and well written. Bristly guitars and a simplistic drum pattern drive the verse, which providing an effective complement to the wispy, yearning vocals of the chorus. The eerie and chaotic final two-minute section of the track is the album’s first shining moment, proving that British Sea Power sound best when they experiment to their strengths.
 
The band once again uses unconventional composition to their advantage on the strongest track, “Monsters of Sunderland,” which opens with a trumpet fanfare that quickly turns into an almost-funky garage-pop groove. The track comes together intricately, featuring a short vocal, trumpet, and bass trio that expands into the fiery and charged outro. British Sea Power can write a catchy rock song that demands the listener’s attention, and accordingly, “Machineries of Joy” features several diamonds in the rough—but unfortunately, the “rough” refers to the rest of the album.
 
Ultimately, a few promising tracks can’t save “Machineries of Joy” from mediocrity. The album opens weakly with its title track, which underperforms both in lyricism and composition. Instead of cultivating the riskier sound of their stronger songs, British Sea Power immediately introduce a sound that has almost become pedestrian among today’s plethora of indie rock bands: a simple drum pattern adorned with wobbly, broken guitar chords. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the opener, however, is its uninspired chorus. British Sea Power’s usually opaque lyrics are also cast aside in favor of the more direct, lackluster repetition of “We are magnificent machineries of joy.”
 
Unfortunately, the most fitting way to describe the remainder of “Machineries of Joy” is as a cliché of indie rock. Yan sounds like a more mediocre version of Arctic Monkey’s Alex Turner at his worst on “What You Need The Most,” a track that is weighed down by unimaginative composition and tired instrumentation. The slowly unraveling waltz features nearly six minutes of repetitive arpeggios, outlining the same few chords as Yan sleepily describes the beauty of broken love.
 
The second half of the album is similarly pedestrian. “Spring Has Sprung” begins as an uninspired description of spring (“birdsong sings in the atmosphere / spring has sprung out of nothing”), and eventually evolves so that the season’s arrival is compared to a lover in a similarly trite and lifeless fashion (“And that is why you don’t get old / you take your time, you take it slow, skipping and playing in the mud”). The most unique track of the final four is the closing “When A Warm Wind Blows Through The Grass,” which deserves some credit for its evocative aural texture, but it ultimately ends up sounding like an unfinished idea rather than an independent track or an effective conclusion.
 
It seems ill-fitting that a band known for peppering its lyrics with obscure references could be critiqued for being too  blasé in its delivery, but if British Sea Power were aiming to be simplistic and profound, they’ve succeeded too much in the former and not nearly enough in the latter. The inadequacies of “Machineries of Joy” are perhaps amplified in light of the fact that this is British Sea Power’s sixth full-length studio release—although their earlier releases were interpreted as potential, their latest must be met with skepticism and a cocked eyebrow as it starts to become unclear whether or not they will ever develop on their raw skill. One of the biggest risks to a band known for its esotericism is that its greatest strength can quickly turn into vapidity. Although—as always—British Sea Power have displayed their potential, they once again fail to explore it and to release an album that truly uses their talents to the fullest. Until they do so, they will remain victims to their own inaccessibility.

Jazz musicians love puns. Here’s an example: “Just You, Just Me” was a song from a 1929 film called “Marianne,” which was adopted by musicians as a jazz standard and reinterpreted over the years. In the 1940s, pianist Thelonious Monk composed a song with harmonies adapted directly from “Just You, Just Me” but with a new melody, which he titled “Justice.” This kind of oblique reference between “Just Me” and “Just Us” and “Justice” is commonplace, but Monk went a step further when he later renamed his composition “Evidence.” Of course, if you knew the tune had been called “Justice” before, the punning logic would need no explanation. These sorts of stacked associations, though, lead to some of the most interesting puns.
There are different flavors of puns, but one of the most common in jazz is what might be called a “recursive pun,” which Wikipedia defines as “one in which the second aspect of a pun relies on the understanding of an element in the first.” This describes not only the multistep logic behind “Evidence,” but also the rationale for a host of other classic compositions titles: Charlie Parker’s “Confirmation” was followed by Sonny Rollins’s “I Know,” Miles Davis’s “Tune Up” preceded John Coltrane’s “Countdown,” “How High the Moon” was reimagined as Coltrane’s “Satellite,” and so forth.
The practice of writing a new melody over existing harmonies, as Monk did with “Evidence,” is generally acknowledged as a major innovation of the bebop era, which encompasses the music of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and others in the decade after WWII. In academic parlance, these compositions are known as “contrafacts.” The story goes that jazz musicians enjoyed using American pop songs of the time as improvisational vehicles—primarily for their harmonic frameworks—but sought to avoid raising performing and recording expenses with royalty payments. Instead, they managed to play these same songs by writing contrafacts. Punning titles weren’t just inside jokes for musicians, though; sometimes, as in “Evidence,” they referenced their antecedents to create a point of tangency between the older music and the newer.
Not all puns are created equal, though. To my mind, the subtle connection between “Evidence” and “Just You, Just Me” is a respectable example of jazz witticism, but there are also far more tasteless titles than musicians would probably care to think about. Case in point: more than a few years ago, the standard “I’m Getting Sentimental Over You” was appropriated for a contrafact entitled “I’m Getting Cement All Over Ewe.” Even more cringeworthy is the album cover, which features the composer pouring a grayish powder onto what appears to be a stuffed sheep.
That same album, however, does feature a more sophisticated type of jazz pun: the translation of a melody from one song onto the harmonic scheme of a completely distinct song. The example from this record is a mash-up of the harmony of “Stella by Starlight,” a lush ballad with elegantly dark harmonies from the 1944 film “The Uninvited,” and the melody of Charlie Parker’s “Donna Lee,” a romping, up-tempo bebop line peppered with rapid chromatic turns. It’s worth noting that “Donna Lee” itself is a contrafact of the 1917 Tin Pan Alley song “(Back Home Again in) Indiana.”
It might just be this uncanniness—the feeling of both vague familiarity and distinct unfamiliarity—that attracts jazz musicians to the pun. Familiar melodies and phrases translated to fit unexpected contexts don’t have to be simply amusing or clever; they can defamiliarize the musical terrain that jazz musicians work with repeatedly when improvising over tired standards.Musical punning should be understood as distinct from “quoting,” though, which is the practice of directly referencing other songs in a song being played—often to ironic or comedic effect.
Musical punning takes this a step further by applying phrases that are familiar and adjusting them melodically to fit somewhere unexpected. They sound similar to the original melodies but aren’t quite the same, and it’s not always clear whether the musician intended to make the pun; this ambiguity is essential.
All puns rely on the ambiguities of language: without ambiguity, or with fixed, singular meaning for words, puns wouldn’t work. The fact that both words and musical phrases can oscillate continuously between meanings based on the context is a testament to the possibilities of language, which can generate both arbitrary and unexpectedly meaningful connections between ideas. There may be a bit of cognitive dissonance involved, but it’s a pleasant kind of dissonance when taken in moderation.
I wouldn’t go so far to say that jazz is characterized by an aesthetic of ambiguity or something like that, but the looseness of the jazz language is something that should be valued. As long as musicians continue to explore new possibilities with the common lexicon and resist the petrifying canonization of the repertoire, jazz will avoid the way of Latin, Anglo-Saxon, and other dead languages of the musty past .

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
He is 20 years old, with light acne and hair that flops in his face, like many other 20 year-old boys. Except that this isn’t a normal college student we’re talking about; Harley Streten, better known by his stage name Flume, is an Australian R&B/techno artist who is slowly leaving his mark on multiple continents. On Thursday he certainly made his mark at Middlesex Lounge.
The Aussie-born producer got his start from a music kit in a cereal box at age 13. Since then, his mesmerizing single, “Sleepless,” has reached number one on Australian iTunes and has been featured in a variety of surfing-related videos on the Internet. His performance—while not without its rough patches—demonstrated a certain prowess for rhythmic understanding that is rare for someone so young, showing that he is destined to be more than a one-hit wonder.
 
The night didn’t start with Flume’s effortlessly infectious music, however. The three-hour space between when doors opened and when Flume arrived on the scene was occupied by two other artists signed under the Mmmmaven label: Coral Cola and Durkin. While neither band wields the same kind of star power as Flume, both were fitting transitions into the electronic instrumentals of the main act and had the crowd dancing without inhibition.
 
The nice thing about fans of an artist like Flume is that they are not afraid to dance. Distracting things like lyrics that might compete for one’s attention are a non-issue; there are only the beats to focus on. Rather, Flume and his predecessors ran into the opposite problem. The concert-goers were so into the music that they refused to stop ramming into his sound table, even when their antics threatened to kill the entire performance. His laptop and synthesizer were perched dangerously close to the raucous crowd, who were able to reach out and touch him due to the close quarters of Middlesex Lounge.
Clearly not meant for the kind of crowd drawn by an artist like Flume, the intimate setting was so packed that the line for the bathroom easily blended in with the rest of the crowd. The recently established club has minimal seating and lighting, fostering a dance-focused environment that was perfect for the crowd full of hip twenty-somethings.
 
Even for those not well versed in electronic music, Flume’s style has a certain universal appeal because of the mesmerizing quality of his repetitive riffs. Flume had a remarkable ability to read the crowd and gauge exactly how to get every person engaged (although this wasn’t difficult, considering how passionately everyone seemed to feel about his music). Even though his songs featured few lyrics, Flume’s fans seemed to anticipate every synthesized note.
The way that he transitioned between songs was flawless. At the end of “Holdin’ On” he built upon the song’s existing melody to create an entirely different rhythmic dimension not found on the album. During the climax of his song “Insane,” Flume raised his arms and closed his eyes like an orchestra conductor in a trance. Perhaps this was some indication of his up-and-coming mastery of the genre, but Flume still managed to maintain an incredibly humble presence, smiling quietly to himself and rarely speaking to the crowd.
However, despite Flume’s promising show of talent, his performance did not go off without a hitch. At one point an equipment malfunction caused the music to cut out completely, which definitely sapped the energy of the performance—if only temporarily. There were times when the repetitiveness of his songs needed to be interrupted as they stretched into monotony, and his performance ended rather anticlimactically without an encore. Still, the young performer with bad posture and a flair for beats certainly quenched the audience’s thirst for dancing on a Thursday night, giving Cambridge a taste of his promising musical career.

When Mary Roach writes about science, she doesn’t just include the unpleasant bits—she actively pursues them. So far, in her career, Roach has written books about cadavers, the afterlife, sex, space travel, and, most recently, digestion. As part of the promotion of her latest work, “Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal,”  Roach was the guest of honor at a talk and book signing at the Brattle Theatre on last Friday. Though the event was clearly centered on “Gulp,” it spawned conversations about the gritty details of many of her other works as well. The captivated audience seemed to care less about Roach as an author working in the publishing industry than about her ability to capture, with an immersive research approach, the humor that arises from the sometimes gross, generally untouched corners of science.
The night’s jovial mood was set quickly by host Chris Kimball, American chef and radio personality, who opened the night by sharing his thoughts on Roach’s approach to science: “Mary Roach is like the 10-year-old who just loves the yucky stuff.” From there, Kimball and Roach gleefully jumped from anecdote to anecdote as they described Roach’s various adventures: asking a crematorium owner in China if he removed meat from the “anterior side” of human carcasses to sell to a restaurant for its dumplings, accidentally brushing her teeth with Gyne-lotrimin (a type of vaginal cream), and riding a reduced-gravity aircraft—colloquially known as the “Vomit Comet”—to name a few.
Roach’s wild antics can present themselves as a bit chaotic, but they are an integral part of her admittedly frenzied research and writing processes. “I start out and have four months of random flailing,” she said. “I have to accept that there is going to be a period of just complete and utter uselessness.” The best-selling results of her inimitable methodology are very appreciated by her fans, though. Brita Martin, an attendee who has read nearly all of Roach’s works, lauded the final products’ readability and entertainment value. “I think it’s really great that [she] is able to take occasionally dense and scientific literature and translate it in a likable and humorous way for the everyday reader,” Martin said.
Despite her ability to synthesize scientific information and interest in the field, Roach does not have an extensive background in the natural sciences. With a B.S. in psychology from Wesleyan, Roach is driven by an innate sense of curiosity, desire to explore unconventional topics, and an attitude she herself describes as “puerile.” From on the audience’s questions, it became apparent that much of Roach’s appeal stems from the combination of inquisitiveness and abandon that leads her to topics most authors neglect. Even after reading the macabrely funny “Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers” and the undeniably risqué “Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex,” avid Roach fans wanted more. One woman asked, “Is there, in any of your five books, a chapter or story you had to omit?” The response to this question was a surprising anecdote from Roach’s “Bonk” research that culminated in the comparison of a type of Easter candy to a sexually induced muscular reflex.
Roach’s talk and book signing, which played more like a celebrity interview on a late-night talk show, reflected what the books promise for the attendees; it was able to strike a balance between information and a fun medium through which to convey it. With topics ranging from the similarity of Cheetos and kibble to feeding babies peanut butter formed to look like feces, the talk lacked boundaries just as Roach’s books do.

“We Own Tonight” – New Kids On The Block
This new track off NKOTB’s new album “10” is definitely less creepy than a lot of the material the middle-aged musicians have put out since their comeback in 2007. It’s also unlistenable. “We Own Tonight” has all the melodic intricacy of an “American Idol” coronation song with arguably less lyrical quality; every time a member of the group sings the lines “Like a candle that’s burning in the wind / We’re burning fast” with seriousness, it’s hard not to laugh. Add in some cut-rate and poorly-disguised Auto-Tune that makes half the singers sound like their throats are filled with mucus, and the following becomes apparent: New Kids on the Block aren’t burning fast. They’re burned out.
 
“If You Didn’t See Me [Then You Weren’t On the Dancefloor]” – Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.
Detroit duo Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. doesn’t only have a killer name—they’ve been quietly putting out great, catchy indie pop for the past couple of years. “If You Didn’t See Me” takes them into slightly synth-ier territory, but remains properly quirky and oddly sultry: “You’re supposed to roll your hips in time / You’re supposed to see your age rewind” sings the duo in one verse, before the ecstatic chorus bursts in. Enjoy these guys while you can—it won’t be long until they get the Foster the People treatment and you’ll be forced to hate them.
 
“Fine China” – Chris Brown
Chris Brown just makes it too easy. Although a lot of people aren’t ever going to forgive him for assaulting Rihanna, his lyrical choices also make it really tough to forget about the incident. On “Fine China,” the newly released single from his upcoming album “X,” Brown sings, “It’s like all the girls around me don’t have faces.” Well, not if you have anything to say about it, Chris. Yet, whatever his faults, the guy is far from a bad musician. “Fine China” is a sleazy, MJ-esque jam that shows off Brown’s vocal chops, even if its lyrics demonstrate a disturbing flippancy towards his past.

“Every individual [in the River Charles Ensemble] checks his or her insecurities at the door and engages in the work with the expectation to learn and contribute as much as possible,” cellist Theodore A. Peng ’13 said in his opening address to the audience. For the conductor-less student orchestra, this idea is essential to ensuring that each member actively takes part in shaping the group’s sound. The result is a clear bonhomie that translates into spirited, engaged performances and interpretations with a strong sense of direction. And while the ensemble’s Friday evening concert at Memorial Church was not without a few flaws, the performance was largely solid and, more importantly, emotionally perceptive.
The program’s first piece was a work from Gioachino Rossini’s opera “L’Italiana in Algeri,” a smart choice for a starter due to its light, carefree feel. The piece begins gently, and the orchestra excellently paced the mounting tension. Particularly beautiful were the oboe solos by Claire R. Leibowicz ’16, whose elegant glides and flourishes connected the piece. The flute solo, meant to be a companion to the oboe solo, was less successful, with a few false steps and a tone that was initially somewhat indistinct and breathy. But this improved as the piece went on, and the later call-and-response section between the woodwinds and the orchestra captured the playful, comic spirit of Rossini’s work.
The second piece on the night’s program was “Olé Guapa,” a tango by Dutch composer Arie Maasland, more commonly know as Malando. While most tango music uses strings, piano, and an accordion-like instrument called a bandoneón, this piece was written for a full orchestra. River Charles, however, performed it as a woodwind quintet, which fit the music surprisingly well. While the piece was a bit muddled in places, the group largely succeeded in using the distinct voices of the instruments, from the light flutes to the reedy bassoon, to draw out the many threads of the melody. The result was a complex rendition that still remained true to tango’s dark, sultry spirit.
Another program highlight was Edward Elgar’s “Introduction and Allegro for Strings.” The group’s rendition captured the pathos of the piece by stretching out notes and making skilled use of expressive vibrato. The violin solos in particular were plaintive and heart-rending, and their bittersweet notes were never drowned out by the swell of the other strings. The group also succeeded in evoking the full emotional range of the piece—the players were able to execute both the soft, wistful sections as well as those that required great force and intensity. Towards the middle, however, the rendition became dynamically flat; without some variation to help contour the piece’s subtle emotional shifts, it was easy to get lost in the sound.
The crowning achievement of the night was the performance of Beethoven’s Fifth Piano Concerto, which saw the culmination of the orchestra’s considerable skill. Guest pianist Allen L. Yuan ’15 from the Harvard College Piano Society helmed the piece, dazzling with his technical mastery from the first rippling arpeggio. The ensemble proved adept at balancing the many simultaneous voices and allowed the clarion-clear notes of the piano to shine. The dynamic complexity of the performance traced the emotional arc of the concerto, from boisterous energy to haunting tenderness.
Still, while it was a success overall, the performance of the Beethoven Concerto was not without technical issues. Most disappointingly, Movement II, the concerto’s famed quiet movement, lacked the emotional finesse that so defined the ensemble’s rendition of the first movement. While he did use rubato in places, Yuan’s delivery was rather measured overall: he glossed over notes he would have done well to linger on for a moment or two longer, and his relatively limited use of the damper pedal likewise undercut the movement’s delicate, contemplative air. Overly assertive woodwinds amateurishly overpowered the piano during the first crucial emotional transition. Another misstep came in the first movement, when the timing of the pizzicato strings became unglued from that of the piano they were trying to accompany. But the conductorless orchestra wasn’t derailed—communicating through body language and eye contact, the strings calmly managed to bring themselves back into line the next time the theme came around, pulling it off without a hitch.
The River Charles Ensemble’s passion, energy, and sense of community ultimately came through in their expressive, affecting performances. While not without mistakes, the players’ ability to self-correct and solve problems among themselves while performing was impressive, a fact that gave the clear impression that this is an orchestra on its way up.

On his 2011 eponymous debut, James Blake tossed dubstep, blue-eyed soul, and piano balladry into a blender and hit “pulverize,” ending up with a fascinating set of what could only tentatively be called songs. Blake seemed to delight in destroying his own creations, swallowing up perfectly fine slow jams with cascades of white noise and defiling his own pretty-boy falsetto beyond recognition. “James Blake” was thus equal parts compelling and teasing—it felt more like a collection of musical sketches than an album, and it offered more questions than answers as to the young London producer’s talents.
  “Overgrown,” Blake’s excellent sophomore outing, makes good on every promise of his debut. The album is both more immediate and more sonically lush; it moves away from the minimal dub of its predecessor into more standard pop territory even as it maintains the experimental sensibility that’s turned so many heads over the past few years. Most impressive, though, is Blake’s growth as a songwriter. His lyrics about love worn down by time and distance mesh with his meticulously skewed and degraded arrangements to create electronic music with a beating human heart.
The most immediately striking aspect of the album’s 10 tracks is that they sound significantly fuller than the deconstructed versions of themselves that populated “James Blake.” They have a clear sense of musical direction, indicating that Blake finally seems sure of where he wants to take the listener. It’s a change that’s likely to bring even more people into the James Blake tent, and for good reason. The first single “Retrograde” opens softly, with sparse piano and Antony Hegarty-like humming. Muted orchestral bass hits and R&B handclaps build tension until Blake releases it with a shout of “suddenly, I’m hit!” At that point, multicolored synths ooze down the walls, pooling into a dense mess of dissonance that buoys Blake’s most impressive vocal performance yet. He repeats this trick on “Voyeur,” perhaps the only genuine club banger Blake has ever produced. After a deceptively subdued half-time introduction, he doubles the pace and starts to add layers—first a rhythmic loop of his own voice, then skittering keyboards, then the same dripping synths from “Retrograde.” It culminates with Blake pulling the floor out from under the whole thing with a minute of gyrating, dark electro-house that’s straight-up sleazy.
This is not to say that Blake’s gone soft with age, though. His experimental proclivities are as apparent as they have ever been, but now they are focused more on structure and effect than on sonic oddity. Opening track “Overgrown” is a five-minute-long crescendo that gradually leaks a string orchestra onto its minimal beats, recalling his debut’s “The Wilhelm Scream” in development but drawing its energy from actual instruments rather than white noise. And though Blake lets his voice stand on its own more than ever before, displaying a previously unheard strength and fullness, he’s still willing and able to contort his vocals into unique shapes. On the gorgeous, piano-centered interlude “DLM,” Blake surrounds his unadulterated voice with pitch-altered versions of it, then finishes it up with what sounds like the ghosts of a gospel choir. And on “To the Last,” he drowns his voice in a bath of distortion, then pulls it out from the depths to expose its full-blooded warmth.
The biggest risk Blake takes on the album is also one of its most satisfying moments. On the much-hyped RZA feature “Take a Fall for Me,” he couches the legendary rapper’s lyrics in a bouncy, ethereal beat that pays homage to Wu-Tang’s ghostly hip-hop and updates it for the laptop age. RZA depicts the angst and desperation of a jilted lover watching his girl marry the wrong man, delivering lines like “don’t throw the dice, who let them throw the rice” with claustrophobic urgency. Fragments of Blake’s voice flit above and beneath RZA’s verse like the character’s guilty conscience.
For all its studio virtuosity, though, the most remarkable thing about “Overgrown” is how affecting it can be. Blake recently revealed that he’s in a long-distance relationship with a woman who lives in Los Angeles, and it’s the stress and uncertainty of this relationship that form the emotional core of the album. The deceptively titled closer “Our Love Comes Back” isn’t about the return of a lover but merely of the memories of her:  “When I see the pictures of every life and the day they die / it’s your image burnt into my mind,” he sings. The interaction between his lyrics and his music is just as important—he wonders, “is this darkness or the dawn?” on “Retrograde” just as the restrained beat breaks down into energetic chaos, placing his confusion at the center of a maelstrom of digital noise.
With “Overgrown,” Blake proves himself to be prodigiously talented both as a producer and as a songwriter. More importantly, he also proves that “electronic” doesn’t have to mean “sterile”—if anything, the album’s cavernous electronics and glitchy production ground Blake’s loneliness solidly in the present day.—Staff writer Matthew J.

Recently, 3D has been undergoing an identity crisis. For almost a century following its invention in 1915, the technology had been a gimmick of sorts—an optical novelty used to draw audiences to mostly cut-rate films—but this is no longer the case. With the success of 3D visual masterpieces such as “Avatar” and “Life of Pi,” films that have revolutionized the medium through new production techniques, there has been an increase in both interest in and expectations for 3D movies. However, instead of embracing the (admittedly expensive) techniques used in “Avatar” and “Pi” for new films, Hollywood has focused its energies in another direction: adding inferior post-production 3D to recent classics and re-releasing those films in theaters. This is a shame, because it unnecessarily dilutes rather than furthers the progress made in 3D of late. More than that, it misses the point—the demand to see these re-releases is almost entirely independent of them being in 3D.
Scanning the slate of recent and upcoming 3D films, the number of re-releases is simply astounding. Disney and Pixar have seemingly already begun the process of re-releasing every classic animated film of theirs, already hitting “Finding Nemo,” “The Lion King,” and both original “Toy Story” films. James Cameron took some time out of his deep-sea-diving schedule to dredge up “Titanic” for re-release. Most recently, Steven Spielberg’s “Jurassic Park” was brought back to theaters in 3D on Friday.
Looking at “Jurassic Park” specifically, what does the addition of 3D bring to the movie that essentially marks the beginning of the modern special effects era? The answer: not much. As with most 3D films that were originally shot in 2D, the bad aspects of seeing “Jurassic Park” in 3D are far more noticeable than the good ones. It’s a lot easier to be distracted by the constant fuzzy, out-of-focus blades of grass and leaves in the foreground than it is to appreciate the intimate sense of space 3D adds to the famous kitchen scene in which Tim and Lex are hunted by the Velociraptors. The lost image quality and brightness noticeably affect the entire film, whereas the few moments made extra-thrilling by 3D, such as when a raptor lunges upward through a ceiling tile at Lex’s swinging leg, last only seconds. Given the choice between seeing a film in its original 2D and a version using post-production 3D conversion, there’s really no room for debate—2D wins every time.
This is a shame, because 3D has already proven that it can, when used well, be awe-inspiring. It sounds obvious, but shooting a 3D film on cameras designed for 3D makes the film look better. A lot better. James Cameron’s pioneering Fusion Camera System brought an extra level of immersion and beauty to his “Avatar” and Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi,” mainly through its subtle ability to convey motion without sacrificing crispness. When the storm engulfs the ship in “Pi,” or when Jake first flies his “ikran” in “Avatar,” the addition of 3D makes the action feel supremely present, removing any sense of distance between the viewer and the film. Post-production 3D achieves this to an extent, but there are always imperfections that break the illusion. For example, in “Jurassic Park,” the scene in which Dr. Grant rescues Tim from a car stuck in a tree is made more engrossing by the way the 3D manipulates the viewer’s perception of the branches’ movement, but the scene also suffers due to how out of focus the leaves look. In short, the details matter.
It also seems as if the success of re-released 3D films (“Titanic 3D” grossed close to $60 million domestically) simply reflects a growing demand to see these movies in theaters, rather than a large demand for 3D versions of these movies. Essentially, the generation that grew up watching “Toy Story” on VHS and DVD is starting to buy movie tickets and is jumping at the chance to see old favorites in theaters, 3D or not. If this is true, Hollywood might be much better served by re-releasing more movies without 3D post-production than by going through the process of changing a select few movies into 3D. It would be cheaper for everybody: film studios wouldn’t have to pay post-production companies millions of dollars for every 3D conversion, and moviegoers wouldn’t have to pay the obnoxious three-dollar 3D surcharge. Win-win.
3D has an exciting future, but it won’t be as exciting if Hollywood keeps on using the technology to look backward. Instead, Hollywood should trust the quality of its older classics, re-release them without 3D, and focus on giving aspiring James Camerons and Ang Lees the tools they need to realize their visions.

“The most terrifying film you will ever experience.”
While director Fede Alvarez’s remake of the 1981 low-budget cult classic “The Evil Dead” falls short of this lofty tagline, it definitely compensates for terror with the grotesque. Original trilogy director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell serve as producers in this largely faithful adaptation, which amplifies the former’s “splatter” qualities through 30 years’ worth of special effects advances. Despite polished visuals and creative filmography, the new “Evil Dead” (now without “the”) fails to modernize itself plot-wise, falling prey to horror movie clichés that render it fully a replica rather than a potentially novel addition to the horror genre.
The film opens harmlessly enough, with five friends heading to a cabin in the woods to force their friend Mia (Jane Levy) into sobriety. Her distant brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) has returned home to provide her with emotional support, but with that, all attempts at exposition come to a shuddering halt. The friends soon discover the grisly site of a past exorcism in the cabin’s cellar, containing at its center a barbed wire-tied book bound in human flesh. In the first of many cringe-worthy, poor character decisions, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) decides to ignore the book’s ominous warnings—“Don’t say it! Don’t write it! Don’t hear it!”—and accidentally summons a demon that commences the film’s hour-long tour de force in gore.
Fans of “The Evil Dead” will note the many references and tributes sprinkled throughout Alvarez’s film, ranging from a reimagining of the infamous tree scene to an after-credits cameo by Campbell. Although the demon antagonist retains its deep and distorted voice, it has definitely learned more than a handful of obscenities (“The Exorcist”-style) during the past three decades. In this remake, the demon’s possessed victims also look less like Heath Ledger’s Joker after a bar fight and more like characters from “The Ring.”
Alvarez also takes a lot of filmography cues from “The Evil Dead,” especially the long tracking shots from the perspective of the demon. In the style of recent horror films, he opts to avoid pop-up scares and instead focuses on the gradual development of suspense leading up to unusually grotesque reveals. In most scenes, the audience knows that something is coming, but rarely exactly when or how disturbing the visual will end up being.
Levy’s character has the unfortunate distinction of being possessed first early in the film, but she takes advantage of this to demonstrate an effective acting range. Whether as a terrified junkie or foul-mouthed possession victim, Levy delivers a standout performance in a film with little character development. Fernandez also provides a solid portrayal of David, and the black humor and occasional wit of Pucci’s Eric adds much-needed balance to a movie solely propelled by violence.
Don’t expect innovations along the lines of the Joss Whedon-produced 2012 meta-horror comedy “The Cabin in the Woods,” though—once “Evil Dead” picks up steam, Alvarez keeps the hits coming nonstop, and blood flows not in streams but geysers. More than a handful of scenes involve extremely realistic mutilation more characteristic of the “Saw” films than traditional horror movies, while other scenes were surprising due to their creative use of vomit (not bringing food to this film is strongly advised). Major commendations should go to Alvarez for creating such realistic and extensive visuals without CGI, which was only used in touch-ups. Despite all these impressively disturbing images, the film feels a bit hollow when compared to the original.
Ultimately, “Evil Dead” is an enjoyable blockbuster horror film for longtime fans of the original and new viewers alike. Unfortunately, visual innovation alone doesn’t go far in the horror genre anymore, and “Evil Dead” fails to move beyond its effects and into creative storytelling. A noticeable lack of humor or truly memorable characters prevents this film from achieving its true potential: taking a well-established genre and turning it on its head, in the way that “The Evil Dead” accomplished in 1981. So while this remake may not tread new filmmaking territory—or be the “most terrifying film” ever—it definitely achieves a level of gruesome creepiness that won’t soon be matched.

 It’s rare for emerging American screenwriters to have their films enter the Chinese market—largely because an import quota established by the Chinese government both restricts the number of premium feature films allowed to enter the country from the US and sets a cap on the market share they are able to garner in Chinese box offices. However, screenwriters now have a chance to reach the Chinese population through a less mainstream avenue.
 The Beijing State-Owned Cultural Assets Supervision and Administration Office has launched the 2013 Beijing International Screenwriting Competition to encourage screenwriters living in the US to produce works that feature China and to encourage collaboration between these writers and Chinese producers, actors, and directors. The competition is open to writers of any nationality who are based in the United States. International exchange students who are studying in the US or non-citizens also have the opportunity to see their writing come to life in Beijing.
 The event has prize opportunities in both feature film and short film categories. Screenplays must focus on Beijing and, according to the event’s press release, attempt to convey the romance, mystery, and cultural diversity of Beijing. Films must be centered around the Chinese capital, but their storyline should be accessible to both Chinese and American audiences. Finalists will win an all-expenses-paid week-long trip to Beijing as well as cash prizes and the opportunity to have their film financed by Chinese investors. The short film category is open exclusively to college students and recent college graduates. Seven short film screenwriters will have their films financed for production.
 “One of the ultimate goals of the competition is for films to result,” event publicist Chris DeHaan says. “The goal is to foster closer cultural relations between entertainment communities.” The idea for the competition came from Harvardwood, a nonprofit organization consisting of Harvard affiliates working in the arts, media, and entertainment. More Harvard connections helped bring the event to fruition: two-time Academy Award winning documentary film director Mark Jonathan Harris ‘63 and Tracey Trench ‘85, a producer whose works include “The Pink Panther” and “Ever After.”
 The competition is jointly sponsored by Harvardwood, Chinese online content distributor LeTV, and Beijing International Creative Industry Corporation. According to the Beijing Municipal Government, it is an opportunity to expand China’s global cultural influence. The Beijing Municipal Government is using this contest to continue its “Going Abroad, Inviting In” campaign, which seeks to establish a Chinese cultural presence in the global arena while embracing other international cultures. The feature film category entails a 5-11 page script, due by April 7. Short film scripts are required to be 3-11 pages, due by April 20.

The decision of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players to bring “Utopia, Limited; or, The Flowers of Progress” to the stage came at a time of renewed significance for the opera in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Directed by C. E. Chiemeka Ezie ’15, a Crimson Arts editor, “Utopia” is one of the final comic operas written by William Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. The show, which played in the Agassiz Theatre until Sunday, served as a reminder of the farcical aspects of economic success. With this motivation, the Players delivered a charming performance, sometimes marred musically but ultimately buoyed by convincing acting and successful communication of satire.
At first, the Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ performance seemed inconsistent in character, almost disjointed and confusing because some of the characters were played melodramatically while others remained mostly subdued. The opera opened by juxtaposing the female chorus (Bethany A. Harris ’13, Civry P. Melvin ’14, and Catalina Gaglioti, a student at the Boston Conservatory) with the Public Exploder, Tarara (Jack F. Weyen ’16). The chorus, which represented various residents of Utopia, seemed lackluster in comparison to the outlandishly exuberant Tarara, who, with his overwhelmingly slapstick manner, was distractingly singular in volume, action, and ridiculousness.
However, this polarized range of characters quickly became the opera’s greatest strength as the characters began to take on carefully constructed roles and personalities. The strong and mostly humorous performances of minor characters, such as that of the suitor (Ryan M. Rossner ’13) and Lady Dramaleigh (Gaglioti), were often the details that prevented the opera from flagging during the occasionally uninteresting plot. When the suitor fruitlessly charmed Princess Zara (Jillian Rossi, a student at the Boston Conservatory) in “Bold-faced ranger,” his amiable performance, although wordless and short-lived, made his character immediately likable. Similarly genial was Captain Fitzbattleaxe (Christian N. Føhrby ’14), whose winning smile and boyish love for Princess Zara turned him into a familiar, almost too-perfect protagonist. The most well-played characters were the mischievous and scheming Wise Men, Scaphio (Eli E. Kahn ’13) and Phantis (J.T. T. Menchaca ’15). The two actors brought life to the predictable role of the villainous and incompetent duo, quickly becoming the most developed and multifaceted characters in the opera. Kahn particularly did justice to the role of Scaphio, developing his personality through his hilarious confession of love for Princess Zara while maintaining a sinister, power-hungry air throughout the opera.
Unfortunately, the successful acting was sometimes negatively overwhelmed by the pit orchestra, which struggled to play synchronously with the singers or even with itself. Ultimately, the orchestra was too small and under-rehearsed to take advantage of Sullivan’s more intricate compositional moments. Besides problematic intonation and ensemble, the orchestra’s performance created a disjointedness between the pit and the stage; instead of complementing the actors’ performances, the music tended to distract or drag it down. This disorder was most obvious in “Words of love too loudly spoken,” a love song between Princess Zara and Captain Fitzbattleaxe that nearly fell apart when the pit lagged behind the singers’ lines.
Despite the shortcomings of the orchestra, many of the opera’s shining moments occurred during the musical numbers. In “First you’re born,” King Paramount (Brad A. Latilla-Campbell ’16) was impressive not for his vocal performance but for his portrayal of character—his declaration of “Ha! Ha! Ha!” was played down tastefully by his uncertain gaze and demeanor, suggesting that King Paramount was ultimately unconvinced by Scaphio and Phantis’s defense of Utopia’s newspaper. In “Society has quite forsaken,” King Paramount and the representatives from England, collectively called the Flowers of Progress (Gaglioti, Rossner, Føhrby, and Joseph S. C. Goodknight, a graduate student at SEAS) enthusiastically perform a sardonic dance routine that included jazz fingers and a line dance. The biting commentary was boldly and effectively extended with an additional verse contributed by producer Ethan T. Addicott ’14. Instead of reusing the lyrical structure of the previous stanzas, Addicott’s addition brought a feeling of immediacy to the song with the line, “In short, we think your country should be Anglicized completely!”
The success of “Utopia, Limited” ultimately rested on the Players’ ability to translate and package the satire of Gilbert and Sullivan’s original work. Ezie’s decision to reinvent Utopia as a fictional country in the sky rather than a fictional South Pacific island appropriately directed the commentary of “Utopia, Limited” away from imperialism and towards economics. Ezie also omitted the characters for which the opera was initially criticized—including Captain Corcoran and Mikado of Japan, both references to earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas—a decision that further focused the opera’s theme. The Players’ rendition of this satire maintained the charming atmosphere of a traditional Gilbert and Sullivan performance through their convincing portrayals of characters while remaining immediately relevant.

"I’m not a nihilist. I’m an extravagant idealist,” says Andy J. Boyd ’14. Boyd’s idealism is reflected in the gadfly-like character of his writing, which often includes acerbic social and political criticism. In addition to writing and directing several pieces for the Harvard stage, most recently the drama, “Acres of Diamonds,” Boyd composes songs and radio pieces, is active on Twitter and PolicyMic as a commentator on popular culture, and performs improv comedy with the Harvard Instant Gratification Players. His cited influences include German playwright Bertolt Brecht, Brazilian theater director Augusto Boal and the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov.
The Harvard Crimson: You’re very interested in popular culture: you write songs and perform improv comedy. On the other hand you spend time writing plays, some of which are based on classical models like “Antigone.” How are these different interests related for you and what are you trying to do with them?
Andy J. Boyd: I think that artists ought to be engaged with critical response and with popular culture. They shouldn’t view their art as existing apart from their social environment but they should try to grapple with it in a critical way…. I don’t write from life directly. I don’t think anyone does…. I think that an appreciation of culture is necessary to create it. It’s very important to me to feel like I’m engaging with the culture that I’m writing in [and] to not separate my political, historical, artistic, [and] cultural interests.
THC: Do you feel, then, that artists should have moral responsibilities?
AJB: Yes, I do! In our country, we have incredible material comforts. And yet, we’re so sad! There’s this pervading sense of pointlessness to the whole enterprise [and] to the entirety of the neoliberal regime.  At a basic level, questions of value and questions of art and culture have no place in our culture because they don’t add to the gross domestic product. So I feel that art, and religion, and poetry and philosophy all have a responsibility to ask those questions that are antithetical to our neoliberal society.
THC: Your more recent work, plays like “Stingers” and “Acres of Diamonds,” figure angry, young, college-age individuals frustrated with their age, but they often don’t have any better solutions themselves. Does that reflect a view, on your part, that young people are not able to change the world for the better?
AJB: I’m really most interested in doing [the] first part of a work, where the audience and the characters will come in with a more or less stable sense of themselves. And I’m trying to upset that, to rupture it and destroy it and force them to put it back together, hopefully in a better way. But I’m not interested in telling them how to do that. This is what is what I think is the essential difference between the arts and philosophy. Philosophy takes the appearance of chaos, and provides order. Art takes the appearance of order and provides chaos. I don’t think the message of a work of art can be translated into philosophy. So, yes, I do feel that youth can change the world. And yes, I do understand that some of my plays can feel nihilistic, but that’s the error in reading these plays as philosophical. They’re supposed to be provocative, but they’re not supposed to claim that there is no solution. They’re just supposed to claim that what we have now is not the solution.
THC: You went to art school before this. Can you say more about that?
AJB: I went to the Arizona School for the Arts for two years, graduated in 2010. I studied acting, directing, theater, and theory. And my work is very influenced by this. The biggest thing that I got from art school was: a character is not just the role that they play societally, socially, ideologically, but they are also not just not that.  So I’m very interested in seeing how characters are at a certain level stereotypical, and then seeing how those stereotypes change, or break down. The plays start with characters being very clear allegories for ideologies or social positions, and then…they break down. And I think this is maybe the most realistic thing about my plays. We start out with an idea of how we ought to be, and what makes this interesting is the ways in which we fail.
THC: How long have you been writing, or conceiving of yourself as a writer? What led you to decide to write plays?
AJB:  17 was when I started getting serious about writing plays and seeing that as the thing I wanted to do. When I was in art school, we would just do these terrible plays… I kept getting these roles and acting in them and thinking, ‘I can do better than this.’

“It is in motion that things are alive,” Ann Hamilton said on Wednesday as part of a lecture entitled “Art in Public Space.” Hamilton is a public artist, one who designs works that are not intended for display in museums, but in the communal outside world. In her works, Hamilton had to not only explain what her creations mean, but also the confounding public nature of her works.
Hamilton spoke at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum as part of the 2012-2013 ArtisTalk lecture series. Unlike the institutionalized mediums of painting, sculpture, or, more recently, installation, public art is a less common art form. The conversation about public art came at an exciting time  for Harvard’s art museums, given the progress on the ongoing Fogg Museum and the 32 Quincy Street renovation projects.
According to Mary Schneider Enriquez, Houghton Associate Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, the choice of Hamilton as a speaker was due to Hamilton’s conceptualization process and also reflected an effort to inspire public reflection and conversation about public art. Enriquez understands public art as being centrally connected to the quotidian. “Today you can have everything from the fountain in front of the Science Center to Krzysztof Wodiczko's video projection on Bunker Hill. It can be so many things.” Yet, according to her, it is admiration in the eyes of the spectator that makes public art resonate with viewers.
“I do better in non-museum spaces. I prefer spaces with their own social history that imbues the work,” Hamilton said. She spoke about the transformation of everyday, familiar locales into places which allow for intimate artistic or personal moments, even in the widest of spaces. Her recent Park Avenue Armory show, entitled “The Event of a Thread,” which ran from this past December to January, brought together fabric, string, and music to create a multisensory experience designed to stop viewers in their tracks.
Hamilton’s work in the past has incorporated materials as diverse as digital video projection, silk, Tibetan prayer bells, pigeons and peacocks, Mexican jumping beans, and prostheses. “Why read to pigeons?” Hamilton asked the audience, referring to the New York pigeons actually function as part of the audience in “The Event of a Thread.” “Because you may read differently!” she said.
Hamilton’s talk followed a retrospective format in which photographic slides recreated the emotions and formal impressions that may have been felt during fresh viewings. By condensing a substantial period of time into a progression of images, she identified recurrent formal motifs in her past works and how they intersect with the themes illustrated. Viewers saw elements of Hamilton’s past work, including personal-edition silkscreen newspaper from the Pulitzer Building’s “stylus” commission and the awe-inspiring circus-like peacock sanctuary at the Musée d’Art Contemporain de Lyon, with “The Event of a Thread” as the finale.
Though public art initially appears dependent on physical presence in local spaces, Hamilton’s artworks have had their impact across geographic lines. Ragnheidur Harpa Leifsdottir, a performance artist visiting the U.S. from Iceland to see a friend, said she enjoyed the happy coincidence of seeing one of her art icons lecture in person that night after devouring Hamilton’s content on the internet. For her, the allure of the work lies in the relationship the viewer shares with the artist. “I come from a background of performance. The viewer is very important, and her [Hamilton’s] respect for that is the magic of the work,” she said.
Attendees Donna di Bartolomeo and Yarima Ariza, both graduates of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, had the fortune of seeing Hamilton’s past exhibitions in person. “I’ve known of her work before, I saw her speak in Miami. I love her work because of the immersive, visceral environments,” di Bartolomeo says.
“I was struck by the textiles, the touch, the tactility of the work,” Ariza says.
The “ArtisTalk” lecture series will continue on April 23 with Doris Salcedo, a native Colombian who has in the past produced work that makes use of the mediums of sculpture as well as installation.

Celebrated trumpeter Wynton Marsalis will return to Sanders Theatre on April 17 to deliver a lecture on collaboration in jazz. Entitled “At the Speed of Instinct: Choosing Together to Play and Stay Together,” the lecture is the fourth in a series and will explore spontaneity and improvisation within small group settings.
The event will include both a talk and a performance, as Marsalis will bring a group of longtime collaborators and bandmates to illustrate his points. The quintet will consist of Marsalis, Ali Jackson on drums, Carlos Henriquez on bass, Walter Blanding on tenor sax, and Marcus Roberts on piano. Jackson, Henriquez, and Blanding are members of Marsalis’s acclaimed Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. Roberts is not usually part of Marsalis’s group, but the two worked on several albums together in the late 1980s.
The long collaborative history between the five musicians has heightened their musical creativity and allowed them to push boundaries. “When one person zigs, another person might zag,” Jackson says. “When we’re playing, everyone has the same bag of choices, but interesting things will happen.”
Marsalis has delivered three lectures at Harvard over the last two years as part of the university’s ongoing effort to integrate music and art into campus life. His topics have included the evolution of American dance and the link between blues, jazz, folk, and rock and roll. This time, he’ll be focusing on the music he’s famous for with a group that has spent years together honing its sound and developing as a unit.
“Our communication has always been like, he can read my mind, and I can read his,” Roberts says of Marsalis. On the 17th, the quintet will give audience members a glimpse at how this magical collaboration takes place.

Courtney Lewis’s Discovery Ensemble sets out to prove that classical music is not just for the old and dead. The 28-year-old composer and co-founder will lead an ensemble of 50 young adult performers at Sanders Theatre this Sunday at 3 p.m. The performance promises to offer a fresh, new spin on Schoenberg, Beethoven and Schumann.
Co-founded in 2008 by Lewis and artistic director David St. George, a musicologist, the Discovery Ensemble is unique in that many of its performers are in their 20s. “It’s the only orchestra that I’ve worked with where everybody is my age or younger,” Lewis says.
Lewis has experience conducting at the New England Conservatory and the Minnesota Orchestra. With the Discovery Ensemble, he hopes to match high technical abilities with a unique level of collaboration among players. “Aside from the technical element, there is a certain transparency and clarity to the performers,” Lewis says. “You realize how different everything is because of the synergic energy of the stage.” The ensemble will perform Schoenberg’s Second Chamber Symphony, Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4 with soloist Michael McHale, and Schumann’s Symphony No. 4.
The Discovery Ensemble is also distinctive in its focus on social action initiatives within the Boston community. Adopting the educative mission of the Venezuelan organization El Sistema to spread enthusiasm for classical music to children, Lewis and St. George were inspired to translate the thriving educational model they saw in Caracas to Boston. “We are heavily involved in an outreach mission to bring musical experiences to kids in the really deprived areas of Boston—Dorchester and Roxbury—where they have little to no contact with music or any cultural things,” St. George says.
Lewis acknowledges the support of the Sanders Theatre space in creating a unique acoustic experience. “It’s my favorite place to pay in Boston…. The room is really great for a chamber orchestra because it lets the sound bloom.” This Sunday, the ensemble will share music with fans of all ages.

The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers (THUD) were formed in 1999, when a small group of percussionists from Harvard’s music groups came together to create a separate ensemble dedicated to exploring percussion with other like-minded concert musicians. Since then, THUD have grown to 13 members and developed their own style that looks beyond concert percussion to popular culture, pop music, and film for inspiration.
On Friday, THUD will be holding their end-of-the-year concert, “THUD World,” which will be a culminating show for the work the ensemble has been rehearsing this semester. The event will be held in Lowell Lecture Hall at 8 p.m. THUD will be performing new material.
“The easiest way to describe THUD is a combination of our two primary influences in mainstream percussion shows, like Blue Man Group and Stomp, which make music with...normal everyday objects like basketballs and brooms and all kinds of crazy stuff. But we also play a lot of arrangements of orchestral pieces or popular tunes on percussion instruments,” Seungjun Kim ’13, one of the assistant directors of THUD, says.
THUD will also perform at Arts First this year, joined by 20 guest drummers. The first performance by the group was at Arts First in 1999. The spirit of the Arts First show, which will take place on April 27, is to demonstrate the breadth and potential of the organization and the talents of its individual drummers, as well as to get the undergraduate student body excited about percussion.
The show will showcase popular pieces from the group’s core repertoire, including their red solo cups arrangement. “We play with eight people around two tables, and it’s kind of our trademark piece because we play it every semester,” Kim says. “It’s kind of what we’ve become known for.” According to Kim, it is surprising that more people haven’t heard or seen their cups routine, given that THUD have performed it at numerous showcases across Harvard, including Pre-Frosh Palooza and Cultural Rhythms. A video of the ensemble performing this piece has been uploaded to YouTube along with recordings of many of their other performances since 2009. This video currently has over 70,000 views.
“I guess our goal is to get [THUD’s popularity] to a point where everyone has heard about us and knows about cups, so it’s not so novel, but rather something that’s symbolic, part of what people talk about when people talk about Harvard music and extracurriculars.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a Friday evening last April, 8,500 ticket-holders crammed onto the University of Pennsylvania’s Franklin Field. With the arena full to capacity, both undergraduates and guests raged to the beats of indie rock band Passion Pit and electronic dance music DJ Tiësto.
“I had no idea what I was going into,” says Jayshlyn D. Acevedo ’14, who attended Penn’s Spring Fling in 2012. “Penn, I think, is out of this world. I’ve never been to a state school, but I can’t even imagine it. That was absurd. Everyone’s involved and to the highest level.”
At Penn, Spring Fling represents more than just a concert that occurs on one night every year: it’s a highly anticipated celebration that lasts all weekend long.
The following Sunday of that same week last year, Harvard undergraduates gathered in Tercentenary Theater. When musical group Das Racist took the stage on the stairs of Memorial Church, they addressed the sparse crowd: “What’s up, you drunk overprivileged shits?” Harvard students were not amused.
Though outcry has erupted this year over the invitation of rapper Tyga to perform at Yardfest, this is not the first time there have been student complaints about Yardfest as a whole. While other colleges throw massively attended spring concerts, Harvard’s iteration consistently meets a more tempered reception.
The failure of Harvard’s Yardfest to garner strong support from students has been attributed to a number of factors—poor selection of artists, limited funds, administrative oversight, and lack of an overall party culture among them. Though there are a variety of logistical issues that have restricted student planners of the concert, it is the absence of an entrenched culture around Yardfest that speaks to a broader lack of cohesion among College students in regards to social life.
THE GOLDEN YEARS
The predecessor of today’s Yardfest originated in 1994, and the festival has since taken on different names and formats. In those nearly 20 years the event has evolved in fits and starts and an adequate source of funding and positive reception have never been certain.
Former Undergraduate Council President Carey W. Gabay ’94 conceived the concept of Yardfest in 1994 to unify the campus in a single event, following criticisms that he had done little to enhance social life at the College. However, the event—renamed Springfest in 1995—did not necessarily accomplish this task. For the next few years, low attendance rates and lack of funds plagued student planners.
Prospects brightened in 2002, when former University President Lawrence H. Summers offered to cosponsor Springfest, following the results of surveys showing a lack of community cohesion at the College.
“Larry Summers listened to these survey results, which were quite dramatic, and made a conscious effort to address the issue,” former director of the Harvard Concert Commission Justin H. Haan ’05 says.
Haan emphasizes the importance of the enhanced financial backing from the University on the success of these events.
“Without those funds there was no way the events could have occurred. Funding of this sort should be institutionalized,” Haan says.
In 2004, Busta Rhymes performed at the Lavietes Pavilion to a crowd of about 3,000 to strongly positive student feedback, and Bob Dylan rocked Gordon Track and Tennis Center to a sold-out audience of students and community members.
Although these events were extremely well received, the ideal of a popular outdoor concert in Harvard Yard had yet to be realized.
“It was very important to me that Harvard Yard felt like it was the center of our campus. Although we lived in and walked through the Yard, it was rarely a place where College students could congregate comfortably,” says Haan, who stayed on after his graduation to become the campus life fellow at the Office of Student Activities, which has since been absorbed by the Office of Student Life.
In 2006, responsibility for planning the annual spring concert shifted from the Undergraduate Council to the Harvard Concert Commission and the newly minted College Events Board. Once again with support from Summers, students secured Ben Folds as the performer for Yardfest. Folds played to a jovial crowd of undergraduates who were throwing beach balls and flying on tire swings through the typically stately Yard.
With a system of event planning in place, which put students in charge of organizing the concert, Yardfest achieved more consistent attendance. Over 7,000 people showed to hear Sara Bareilles and Ratatat play in 2009. In 2010, Kid Cudi drew an audience of 4,500, followed by a crowd of over 7,000 for headliner Far East Movement in 2011, when Yardfest coincided with Visitas.
Though Yardfest has had successful years such as those, even its record audiences have paled in comparison to those of other schools. And since Yardfest has also failed to maintain audiences of those numbers, there’s still much to be reconciled with the original intention of a unifying, spirited event for students.
NO FUN WITHOUT FUNDING
That Yardfest has been firmly established as a yearly student-engineered event in Harvard Yard certainly stands as a victory for those who originally envisioned it. Yet according to many, it has failed to cement itself as an anticipated occasion in the social calendars of students at the College. Students throw around a number of explanations for why this has failed to be the case, with lack of adequate budget topping many’s lists.
Limited funds have hampered the planners of Yardfest from putting on the raging concert that they would hope to bring to life. “In my experience, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which sets the College’s budget, does not see the value in campus-wide events and as a result has not provided the College with a meaningful budget for these types of events,” Haan says.
At a university with an endowment that far outnumbers those of its peer institutions, one would imagine that funds for a student concert would be easily flowing. However, in 2012 The Crimson reported that student planners were constrained by the $30,000 in funds allocated by the OSL. The OSL would not disclose the budget for this year’s Yardfest. A prevailing assumption holds that other universities funnel much larger sums into their spring concerts, which Harvard students often lament are far superior to Yardfest.
One such event, Slope Day—an event at Cornell University on the last day of spring semester classes—allocated $167,523 to the concert portion of the day alone, with the entire budget totalling $316,934.26, in 2011. That year 17,500 attended the event, outnumbering the undergraduate student population of slightly over 14,000. Yang C. Zhao, Slope Day Chair, characterizes the event: “It’s a time when kids can look back on all the work they’ve done and just cut loose.”
The Slope Day Programming Board applies for funding via the Cornell Student Assembly every two years. The tuition and fees all Cornell undergraduates pay include a $229 student activity fee, from which the student government allocates $18 per student to fund Slope Day. Additional funds are made by selling tickets to alumni and guests of students, who can pay a $25 fee to attend if they purchase tickets over a week before the show.
At Penn, all students pay for tickets to attend the concert portion of Spring Fling. Tickets to the concert on Franklin Field purchased in advance cost $35 for students and $45 for the general public. Penn students can arrange for guest passes to the smaller music events and carnival activities that take place on Penn’s Quad, which are free for undergraduates.
Yet, at Harvard, the College remains committed to keeping Yardfest free of charge for students. “It is a high priority for the College to ensure that there are no barriers to participation to events that are designed to include the entire undergraduate student body,” Kenneth A. Parreno ’11, a student life fellow at the OSL, wrote in a statement to The Crimson.
Advocates of a ticketed concert say that the requirement to purchase a ticket may create a self-selecting group of hardcore concertgoers, while the rest of the student body chooses to spend their time elsewhere. “Because you have to purchase a ticket, I think the people that want to go are really excited about going,” Acevedo says. “However, the people who don’t go don’t feel left out because there’s other things going on at the same time, so there’s just always something to do.”
Yet some students appreciate that the event is free at Harvard. “I think when it actually comes to it, I like that it is free. I like that Harvard thinks a lot about economic concerns of people,” Acevedo remarks.
“You can only achieve the end of putting on an event that facilitates a sense of campus community if it is free for all College students,” Haan says.
AUDIO FEEDBACK
The goals of Yardfest planners closely match those of student organizers of similar events at Harvard’s peer institutions—bringing students together for an inclusive event to relax and cut loose. Factors beyond money may limit Harvard’s ability to achieve this goal.
“[Penn has] so many fraternities and sororities that they have a lot of outside space, social spaces that are not necessarily [overseen] by the University,” Acevedo remarks.
Those alternative social areas may have provided students at Penn with a variety of spring events to attend. Meanwhile, Harvard students are generally funneled into the Yard for a few hours to attend a concert; however, this is not necessarily detrimental to Yardfest itself.  In 2011, when Yardfest coincided with Visitas—the visiting program for admitted students to the College—the concert drew a record number of attendees to the Yard for performers Far East Movement, Sam Adams, and White Panda.
“Pre-frosh weekend, I thought, was amazing and was actually a selling-point for me,” says Linda Zhang ’15, who attended Yardfest in 2011 as a senior in high school. “Not that I was going to turn down Harvard, but it was definitely something that drew me more to the school because you see the fun side. Harvard isn’t just a great school where people study and do great things with their lives, but it’s also a place where people can have fun.”
This experience gave Zhang the perception that Harvard had a vibrant party culture, where students could come together. “It wasn’t something that I quite expected. The concert was crazy and I was like ‘Ah! This must be what college is like everyday.’ So it was a little misleading in that sense.”
This year, student protest mounted when the CEB and Concert Commission announced the choice of rapper Tyga as the headliner for Yardfest. Students signed a petition urging administrators to cancel the performance, citing the artist’s lyrics as “explicitly and violently misogynistic.” Ultimately, the CEB and Concert Commission opted to delay Tyga’s start time but retain him as a performer. This situation has raised questions about what types of art Harvard should promote and what role Yardfest plays in this endorsement.
The choice of the rapper came from student-run committees, who solicited fellow students' opinions and views through a survey sent out in the fall in which the majority of undergraduates expressed interest in a Top 40 artist. By all means, Tyga is a popular artist who has produced chart-topping hits. However, many students expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the choice, and the OSL even asked the CEB to reconsider its decision to book the rapper.
An audience of 17,500 showed up at Cornell in 2011 to hear a performance by hip-hop artist Nelly, famous for his lyrics “I need you to get up up on the dance floor / Give that man what he’s asking for.” However, no strong, vocal opposition arose to Nelly’s performance, and the concert was widely attended.
ADD EVENT: YARDFEST, 12-3 P.M.
The question remains whether this excitement can be replicated at Harvard. Haan casts doubts about this possibility, suggesting that students at the College are independently minded and not accustomed to finding common ground in a social context.
"Harvard students are an incredibly diverse and highly motivated set of individuals,” Haan says.   “It is possible that these very attributes that make Harvard such a great place also present a unique challenge to creating a single event that will appeal to everyone or foster a sense of community more broadly. All this means is that the College has to work that much harder to support it.”
Meanwhile, Spring Fling not only draws a large audience from its own community, but attracts members of others. Though his senior thesis in electrical engineering is due the following Monday, Hilton H. Augustine ’13 is determined to travel to Philadelphia for Penn’s Spring Fling, which he has attended since his freshman year at Harvard. Augustine smiles as he raves about the “awesome” event. He sees the culture surrounding Fling as completely different than that around Yardfest at Harvard. “It’s much more of an entire campus thing and an attitude,” he says. “Essentially from Thursday night on everyone is drinking.”
“It’s hard to create the entire culture around [Yardfest], especially since the way we’ve always had Yardfest has been like one Sunday afternoon, so you know you have school the next day,” he says. Perhaps as a possible solution to the problem of an immediately following school day, Yardfest falls on a Saturday this year. Regardless of the date of the event, Augustine thinks the prospects of Harvard students foregoing their schoolwork for more than one day are bleak. “[At Penn], everyone just knows no work is going to get done for the week, and people are okay with that. I don’t really see Harvard changing their attitude towards giving up a week of school.”
Acevedo agrees that a one-day event is the limit for Harvard students.
“I think one day is Harvard’s limit of excess, and I’m okay with that. Harvard-Yale is one day and everyone is fully committed and you go all in. By the time 6 p.m. comes you’re like, ‘I’m tired,’ and that’s fine. And I think the same goes for [Yardfest]. I think a full weekend is a bit excessive,” Acevedo says. But why exactly is one day the upper limit to Harvard students’ enjoyment of free time? Perhaps Harvard students prevent themselves from having a good time by building up the perception that they don’t have time for fun, or that fun needs to be scheduled into their Google calendars.
However, Parreno believes that Harvard students are capable of changing their perspectives toward college-wide events. “I think sometimes when our students are evaluating events, not just Yardfest, they look at what is missing rather than focusing on the good that is already there,” he says. “There is definitely a time and need to reflect on how an event can be improved, and our office and student leaders certainly do that, but there is also something to be said about being able to sit back and let yourself enjoy an event—especially one that is meant to bring our campus together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every spring, specifically in about a month, the President and Fellows of Harvard College file IRS Form 990, which among other disclosures releases the compensation of several top Harvard officials, including those from Harvard Management Company. Every spring, it becomes known that the heads of HMC earned incomes often a few times more than even President Faust, and sometimes around 100 times more than other Harvard employees. Often a small controversy erupts on campus about this income disparity, with calls to reduce the pay of the top HMC managers. And why not? If your gut reaction to this inequality was not one of discomfort, I would be concerned.
Here are the top three compensations at HMC’s last reporting cycle: President and CEO Jane Mendillo: $3.5 million; Head of Fixed Income Apoorva Koticha: $4.4 million; and Head of the External Platform Andy Wiltshire: $5.5 million. Comparatively, President Faust was paid $875,000. (For context, over 90 percent of HMC portfolio manager compensation is tied to investment performance, and in the six months prior to last year’s released payday, the rate of Harvard’s investment return was 21.4 percent.)
Spoiler: It is not likely that this year’s figures will be much different, nor will our gut reactions. What can be different, I hope, is that we are more prudent this time before we call for compensation reductions. Regardless of the situation’s equity, there is a basic truth existing in the world that Harvard cannot ignore—the market for highly qualified investment professionals is a competitive one. As such, if Harvard were to pay its best too far below competitive wages, those men and women could leave HMC and work at other institutions. In a competitive market, the compensation for top investment professionals will always be bid up to the value they produce for their institutions.
If we were to ignore these market forces and reduce the pay of HMC officials anyway, instead of discovering a more equitable Harvard, we would likely discover those professionals working at Yale or perhaps Convexity Capital Management, the firm founded by former HMC CEO Jack Meyer, who took 17 percent of HMC’s top workforce with him on his way out the door. Those men and women are still being paid highly, and alas, the inequality persists. The only difference is now there are different employees taking their place back home in Cambridge.
In fact, there is substantial evidence that HMC officials are already paid less than market wages. I know what some of you are thinking: How could $5.5 million possibly be less than competitive? And yet, The Crimson found that HMC compensation is “well below Wall Street standards,” resulting in “HMC’s long-running difficulty in retaining talented hires.” This likely means two things for Harvard—losing top talent to other firms resulting in foregone capital gains for the school, and increased adjustment costs resulting from the higher turnover. Lowering compensation further at HMC would only exacerbate these two problems. Indeed, the savings to Harvard from the lower compensation would very likely be overwhelmed by the forgone returns and higher adjustment costs that would ensue. It is important to consider that not even Wall Street firms enjoy paying their employees highly—they are paid highly because management and shareholders believe the firm would be less profitable without the elevated compensation. In a sense, Wall Street firms voluntarily incur higher compensation costs so they don’t have to deal with worse costs.
Let me be clear—by no means am I saying that Harvard or university students in general should stop caring about fairness in their communities. The world would be a much darker place if that happened. On the contrary, I simply think we should be wiser in how we direct our energies to achieve the fairness we seek. There are so many causes we could promote to fight income inequality that would be significantly more effective than taking aim at HMC compensation, such as expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, supporting nutrition and health, or ensuring public schools in poor districts get state and federal funding to supplement their weaker property tax bases. The list goes on.
So please, next month when Form 990 is released, let’s be too busy fighting the real battles to notice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, the Washington Post published a now widely-discussed op-ed in which writer Donna Freitas laments what she calls the phenomenon of “hookup culture” on modern college campuses. According to Freitas, college students are subjected to a culture in which they feel compelled to have casual, noncommittal sex with a large number of partners, even though most students privately admit that they are either ambivalent about or regretful of the lifestyle.
Freitas’ article certainly seems troubling, but Harvard’s data paints a very different picture. Here, at least, the data suggests that there is not an overwhelming pressure to participate in hookup culture. To the contrary, most graduating seniors report having had sexual relations with two or fewer partners. The students who want to participate in a so-called “hookup culture” are able to do so, but there are many students who maintain long-term relationships or remain abstinent. If Harvard’s data is any indication of greater trends, then, there’s no conclusive reason to believe that most college students feel pressured to hook up.
Of course, Harvard’s data is not necessarily representative of college students in general, but the same could probably be said of Freitas’ data. Her op-ed cites quite a bit of anecdotal evidence—individual students discussing their sex lives with her—and her unrepresentative sample (1,230 students, 45 percent of whom attend Catholic colleges) constitutes only a miniscule percentage of the 12.6 million college students in the United States. A survey with a sample size that small simply does not add much to the conversation. Freitas notes that the vast majority of college students interviewed say their peers are casual about sex, but she and other commentators on hookup culture fail to make the important observation that casual sex on college campuses is often much less widespread than students perceive.
Of course, if students are as dissatisfied with the prevailing sexual culture on their campuses as some would argue, then that’s a problem.  Students shouldn’t feel that the predominant culture on campus is barring them from forming intimate, romantic relationships. But popular critiques of hookup culture fail to place it in its appropriate historical contexts. Modern dating culture may have faults, but so did dating and sexual culture in earlier eras. It is important that we not lose sight of the enormous progress that the sexual revolution and feminist movement have made in granting individuals, especially women, greater agency in their sexual choices. Today’s women enjoy much more freedom than they have in the past, and that’s a good thing—long gone are the days of “lights out” in the Radcliffe Quad.
Prevalent dating culture has always been (and probably always will be) a subject of controversy, but popular critiques that lose sight of the larger picture simply aren’t constructive. People’s sex lives will always be confusing, difficult, and sometimes disappointing, and hyperbolic moralizing on the matter is the last thing that our young people need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My mom is a tired hooker.
By now it’s pretty obvious. Basically everyone knows. In fact, she wears the status of her hookerdom proudly on her sleeve—or, more accurately, appropriately, and inappropriately in so many ways, on her chest.  My mom’s new favorite graphic t-shirt, which she wears often and in daylight hours, reads “TIRED HOOKER” in big, bold, shiny, gold letters against a dark black background.
I only found out about this shirt’s unfortunate existence via a picture message from my mom last month. She spent real money on it at  a Kathy Griffin stand-up comedy show. In the photo, my mom is wearing her new shirt next to a girlfriend. It is dark and blurry, and the flash lights only a few things in the frame—my mom’s eyes, a little dust in the lens on the top-right hand corner, and the reflective letters that scream “TIRE HOOK.” Her hands, arm, neck, the “D” “E,” and “R” of the shirt, and even her smile seem to fade into the dark haze. I’ve stared at the picture a good amount. It’s made me realize two things about my mom and myself: 1. Somehow, even when I move 2,615 miles away, she can find a way to embarrass me. 2. She has a more sensible grip on life than I and many other Harvard students do—she knows how to be shamelessly happy.
As a side hustle, my mom works as an English professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She worked hard to graduate college. Then she worked hard to earn a Ph.D. Then she worked hard to become an assistant professor. Then she worked hard to get tenure to become an associate professor. And after a lot of years of working hard (“hard” not in the hooker sense), she became a full professor just a year ago. Now she clocks in for her four-hour workday a blistering two days a week. The rest of the time she writes articles, lounges, hangs out with friends, watches the sunset, calls me randomly whenever I’m in the middle of writing a paper due in two hours, and goes to Kathy Griffin shows to purchase vulgar shirts.
After many long nights of writing in lamplight while eating microwave mac and cheese on a budget, she got her dream job. And as my deadlines piled up, my classmates became more motivated, and I got more obsessed with succeeding during my freshman year, I envisioned my mom back at home, lounging. It was frustrating. She had built a career and now seemed like she was wasting it, meaninglessly, while I was struggling to envision and start mine.
But then I went home for spring break. For a week, my normal deadlines and schoolwork were gone. I took long walks, staring at the sun-drenched roads, trees, and hills of southern California. Right after midterms had passed, I had the luxury of just thinking about what I was doing with my time, why time even existed, and why our society is so averse to nose picking (it’s just another form of self-cleansing, right?). Stepping away from the day-in-day-out grind, I could take a breath and reorient myself to my goals, my writing, and my schoolwork. And after these walks, I came home to my mom lying down, grading papers, exercising, or just pondering. She looked happy. And we’d have long conversations about nothing.
This break, I finally got it. I figured out the secret of the tired hooker’s trade—doing things is meaningless and fruitless without reflection. I’ve been burnt out this semester, chugging through problem sets and deadlines to seemingly no end. It’s the same with many Harvard students. Many other Crimson articles are about stress, study habits, and work at Harvard. Business is the most frequent topic of conversation among students. Concerns about mental health on campus continually grow as more students become affected by the stress bred by their work.
What the tired hooker taught me is that there is not one fix to the problem. Fighting stress and worry is not simply a matter of lessening workloads, spending more time with friends, or becoming more efficient. But one can take as much time as necessary to reflect. Thinking about what you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and where you’re going gives purpose and guidance to work. No matter what, I will still have those 4 a.m. nights at Lamont, stressfully cramming before a midterm and posting many Facebook statuses about how much I hate Lamont and how much I hate Facebook for distracting me. But I’ll never forget to walk around, have an existential crisis, or lie down, with my head facing the sun, staring through my bright red eyelids, thinking about why I do what I do every once in a while.
Because on some days, I, too, feel like a tired hooker. Being young and restless and worried, I get fed up. I put on a face. I socialize. And I work to no end. But on those days, I look at that photo of my mom, lit-up, happy, and free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard takes the lead on a bold new plan “to reach out to students of all ages, means, and nations,” using the latest technology and the power of Harvard’s name to distribute knowledge across the globe, I’ve found myself wondering—why am I not more excited about edX?
Its themes of democracy and progress, coupled with the promise of redistribution of power through education, seem exactly the sort of things that a leftist university student like me would swoon over. Yet I still feel slightly uneasy with edX’s promise to reform both Harvard and global education through an online platform. Perhaps this is because of the assumption that everyone in the world wants to access Harvard professors’ knowledge, and perhaps it’s because of Harvard’s supposition that simply making information available online will reach students “of all means.”
I’ve heard many critiques of edX and its attempt to rapidly revolutionize the world of online courseware. Someone more knowledgeable about the inner workings of the edX technology might point out that expanding an online learning platform to encompass more than a dozen universities in less than a year is an unsustainable rate of growth, or that Harvard and other universities need to raise funding and build infrastructure to organize online classes before they can hope to effectively serve one million (if not one billion) students.
But what does it mean that Harvard has sponsored an education platform to disseminate professors’ lectures across the world? Perhaps we should consider the philosophical foundations that have motivated President Faust and other university leaders to spread Harvard scholarship across the globe.
First, making Harvard, MIT, and other university courses available for free or a small charge online may allow tens of thousands of students to access the words of Harvard faculty via their computers. However, this alone will never be a social equalizer—after all, access to regular internet and free time to complete a course is itself a privilege, and the students who seek out and successfully complete courses through edX are likely those who already have the academic discipline engendered by formal education. EdX does not challenge the structures of inequality and power that give people differential access to education based on race, gender, nationality, and class.
But more importantly, a model of education based on learning indirectly from prestigious faculty members is not necessarily democratic, or even beneficial to students. In narrating edX, Faust often shares hopes of bringing Harvard faculty knowledge to bear more effectively on social problems across the globe. Indeed, while Harvard might send one or two students with public health degrees to India to design health interventions in developing areas, HarvardX has opened up courses like “Health in Numbers: Quantitative Methods in Clinical & Public Health Research” to thousands of students in India who can all learn from the expertise of Harvard faculty. However, although disseminating knowledge from centers of power to developing areas seems an admirable goal, we should think critically about the implications of this in a globalized world. After all, Americans in positions of power have long tried to spread democracy and liberalism through education, with a very poor track record. The idea that public health can be quantified and modeled statistically stems from a neoliberal model of human behavior that may not leave room for the lived experiences of real people. Perhaps quantitative methods in clinical research are exactly what Indian health policymakers need. But perhaps they will obscure the realities of lived experiences, imposing American models of healthcare on people that would be better off without the advice of an academic in Cambridge, Mass.
In my two years as a social sciences concentrator at Harvard, I have taken a quite a few lecture classes and quite a few discussion-based reading seminars. Almost unilaterally, my lectures have allowed me to absorb information and learn my professor’s own analysis; they usually leave little room for critiquing a professor’s methodology or even learning about alternative approaches. On the other hand, my seminars have provided room for me and my classmates to put texts in conversation with each other; we challenge our professors and each other to think more critically about the material we are learning. Certainly, there is a role for lecture-based learning in universities. But if the goal of a liberal arts education is to train students to be better thinkers and to truly address global problems, that education must leave room for rigorous and critical engagement. While I admire edX’s attempts to experiment with integrating new technologies like wikis and online statistical analysis into coursework, I remain convinced that these techniques of learning cannot substitute for small-group face-to-face discussion. EdX’s platform sends the message that learning can simply mean studying the thoughts of big-name Harvard or MIT professors via the internet.
Some might accuse me of being a left-wing Luddite. Others might note that championing “traditional” classroom-based education might put me in an uneasy alliance with socially conservative proponents of classical education. Yet I am convinced that education shouldn't involve simply absorbing information from a lecturer. This is especially true across national boundaries, given a long history of imperialism in which U.S. elites have told an increasingly globalized world that what they thought was best. If Harvard thinks that edX will shift the social order through democratic education, I am afraid that it is fooling itself plus tens of thousands of students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 4, 2013, at 4:16 a.m.
The College Events Board and the Harvard College Concert Commission will retain rapper Tyga as the headliner for Yardfest, but will push back the start time of his performance on Saturday to accommodate students unhappy with the selection, the two organizations announced in a statement Monday night.
Several Eliot House residents have also arranged an alternative concert to be hosted in Eliot courtyard during Yardfest. The Eliot concert will feature a hip-hop artist scheduled to perform at the same time that Tyga will be on stage in Tercentenary Theatre.
The CEB and HCC’s announcement comes a week after an undergraduate launched an online petition on Change.org urging Harvard administrators to cancel Tyga’s performance at the annual spring concert due to lyrics described in the petition as “explicitly and violently misogynistic.” The petition garnered 400 signatures in its first hour online and has since collected more than 2,000 signatures.
The day after the petition went up, administrators in the OSL asked the CEB and HCC to reevaluate their choice of Tyga in response to the student outcry.
In their statement Monday night, the CEB and HCC wrote that they decided to delay the start time of Tyga’s performance until after dinner so that students uncomfortable with the artist can still eat a meal and socialize with friends at Yardfest.
“We hope this change will allow all students to feel they can take part in the communal aspect of the event, hang out with friends, enjoy some food, and watch our amazing student openers (Puttanesca and The Cantab Cowboys) perform before dinner concludes,” the CEB and HCC wrote.
Leah Reis-Dennis ’13, the student who launched the Change.org petition and is also involved in planning the alternate concert in Eliot, said she is disappointed in the CEB and HCC for not cancelling Tyga’s performance.
Still, Reis-Dennis said she was excited for the Eliot concert performer, who she declined to name immediately due to contractual obligations.
“The performer that we’re inviting is a great representative of hip hop and is a great artist that we’re excited to introduce to the Harvard community as a whole,” Reis-Dennis said.
Reis-Dennis said she and other organizers have worked closely with Eliot House Master Gail A. O’Keefe to plan the alternative concert, which will feature professional sound and lighting.
The Eliot concert will be funded by the Office of the Dean of the College. It will be supported by the Eliot House Masters, according to Reis-Dennis.
“The idea is that students will go to Yardfest for dinner, and they will go to support the awesome student bands,” Reis-Dennis said. “And then we’re hoping before Tyga’s performance, students will walk out and will attend our concert.”
Student leaders of the CEB and HCC could not immediately be reached for comment early Tuesday morning.

CORRECTION: April 17, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the alternative Yardfest concert in Eliot courtyard was funded in part by the Office of Student Life. In fact, the Eliot concert was funded by the Office of the Dean of the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council voted 7-1-1 Monday night in favor of approving the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s rezoning petition, paving the way for the university’s plans for development of lab, office, housing, and research space in Kendall Square.
Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Economic Development Gregory P. Bialecki ’82, who attended the meeting on behalf of Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78, was among the unusually large crowd of people who came to lobby the Council on the rezoning petition.
Bialecki told the Council that the Patrick administration is in favor of the development plans in Kendall Square as cities such as New York challenge Cambridge’s “unquestioned dominance” in the field of innovation on the East Coast.
Bialecki said the Patrick administration is working to retain the state’s status as a leader in the science, technology, engineering, and math industries.
“We’re asking you to do the same,” Bialecki said during the meeting.
Several entrepreneurs echoed Bialecki’s concerns that Cambridge is losing ground as a center of innovation.
Brian Gilman, co-founder of the Cambridge-based technology company Wingu, said that his investors had asked him to relocate to New York City or San Francisco. Gilman argued in favor of MIT’s development plans for Kendall Square, saying that as long as MIT continues to attract the best and brightest students, Cambridge companies will be able to recruit the best and brightest workers.
Several Cantabrigians acknowledged the role the proposal might play in growing the city’s innovation industry but lobbied the Council to allow the petition to expire, citing  concerns over housing and environmental impact.
“The graduate student housing issue has a tremendous impact on people who rent apartments,” said Cambridge resident Mike Connolly, referring to the high number of MIT students who look for housing outside of the university in the midst of an overheated housing market in Cambridge.
As of June 2012, 62 percent of MIT graduate students lived in off-campus apartments, according to an MIT faculty newsletter.
Concerns over the housing market were one factor in the Council’s decision not to support the rezoning petition in 2011. Since then, MIT has changed the housing provisions within the petition. While the proposal brought before the Council in 2011 provided for only 60 units of affordable housing, the version approved Monday night promises up to 365 units.
Councillor David P. Maher spoke in favor of the petition, asking the Council to weigh its costs and benefits.
“MIT has done an outstanding job at listening to the Council, listening to the planning board, and listening to the community,” Maher said. “There wasn’t a lot in Kendall Square that people wanted to go and visit. People have worked to reshape what Kendall Square is and what it can be.”

Hundreds of members of the Class of 2016 crowded into Annenberg Hall Monday night for the kickoff of advising fortnight.
The two-week long program consists of a series of panels, open houses, teas, and socials for each of the College’s 48 concentrations with the goal of helping freshmen to choose their concentrations by the end of their sophomore fall.
“The message is just to keep your mind open,” said Valerie R. Lazzari, administrative coordinator of the advising programs office.
On Monday night, Annenberg contained over 50 academic subject tables with students, tutors, faculty and chairs of various departments. The representatives enticed students to their various fields in numerous ways. Some departments used sign-ups and pamphlets, while others offered candy and other gifts. The Computer Sciences department gave away CS50 stress balls to prospective concentrators.
Upperclassmen present at the event promoted the support and one-on-one attention they receive in their respective concentrations.
“I went to my tutorial a few weeks ago and then spent half the time talking about my life,” said Gargi Chaudhuri ’14, a history and literature concentrator.
Other upperclassmen mentioned tutors who had taken concentrators to coffee or attended midnight movie premieres with students.
Rachel H. Johnston ’14, another history and literature concentrator with a medieval studies focus, said that although her tutor did not attend movie premiers, she did answer her phone calls well past midnight.
All freshman must complete at least one advising conversation by the end of the fortnight, which can include attending an event or having a personal meeting. To get students interested in a department, faculty members encouraged students to set up individual meetings.
“You grab them as they walk past,” said Andrew Berry, a lecturer of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and assistant head tutor.
Some students expressed mixed feelings about the event.
“It was a little overwhelming at first,” said attendee Jordan K. Degraaf ’16. However, “There were a lot of helpful staff and faculty members,” she added.

Christian author Jim Wallis and Memorial Church Minister Jonathan L. Walton argued that the public should harness the power of religion to pursue the “common good” in politics on Monday in an event hosted by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership.
The panel, entitled “Religion in the Public Square,” jumped between topics included in Wallis’s latest book “On God’s Side.” Moderated by the Center for Public Leadership Director David R. Gergen, most of the discussion revolved around using religion to achieve social justice.
“The book talks about how we might apply this notion of the common good,” Wallis said. “How do we make choices that really can impact the common good?”
Wallis, who is editor-in-chief of Sojourners magazine, brought up immigration reform as a current hot-button issue that reveals the significance of this idea of “the common good.”
“The common good is triumphing over politics on that one issue in D.C.,” said Wallis, who mentioned the importance of mobilizing religious communities in order to achieve political goals. Wallis pointed to the civil rights movement as a poignant example of such mobilization.
Walton, who is also the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, described issues pertaining to race and to the legacy of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, highlighting the upcoming 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Letter from Birmingham Jail.
“The civil rights movement would not have been possible without Black churches,” Wallis said.
Walton echoed Wallis, stressing the importance of “this notion of the common good, this notion that we are in this together.”
“What affects one of us affects all of us,” said Walton, who mentioned light-heartedly that he signs off on his e-mails with “one luv.”
In his introductory remarks, Gergen praised both Wallis and Walton.
“[Walton] is deeply engaged in, and has been for a long time, the history of African-American religious belief and theology,” Gergen said. “Like Jim Wallis, he is also a champion of social justice.”
In a similar vein, Gergen described Wallis as “a progressive evangelical who has deeply been concerned all his life with social justice.”
“He continues to be a champion of social justice,” Gergen said.
The panel was followed by a book signing reception at the Coop.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, four panelists came together in the JFK Jr. Forum on Monday to discuss the role of business and government in making America work.
Moderated by Fortune magazine senior editor and a former IOP fellow Nina J. Easton, the panel discussed a wide range of economic issues facing the U.S. from the state of its political institutions to global competitiveness.
Roger B. Porter, IBM professor of business and government at the 	Kennedy School, noted that U.S. government spending has increasingly been dominated by mandatory or entitlement spending.
“We have lost the flexibility to spend in ways that is going to benefit us and the future generations,” Porter said.
Lawrence H. Summers, a former University president and now a professor in the economics department, agreed and added that the assumption that future generations are going to be better off has been challenged.
“It is in doubt because the overall trend of economic growth appears to have slowed,” Summers said. “The level of inequality and the level of social immobility has deteriorated.”
On another note, Benjamin W. Heineman Jr. ’65, senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, discussed the role of business in the U.S. landscape. According to Heineman, with the shifting focus onto shareholders and the decline of manufacturing, the U.S. has reached an all-time low on trust in corporations.
The shifting economic balance has also affected foreign relations.
“The whole question of economics has really come to the forefront...in terms of the overall assessment of our power base,” said Paula J. Dobriansky, senior fellow at the Belfer Center and undersecretary for democracy and global affairs in the Bush administration.
“I think one of the good news stories is that the U.S. government...has developed public-private partnership,” Dobriansky said.
The assertion, however, aroused disagreement from other panelists, citing the fear of “crony capitalism.”
“To recognize that I am going to do more than anyone else has asked me to. It’s that kind of leadership...that we need to see in business and government,” Porter said.
The panel ended with a discussion of the state of the U.S. democracy.
“Serious concerns have always been there,” Summers said. “But I assure you, we will surmount in critical ways for long time to come.”

After years of swimming in suspicions that fish confer health benefits, a new study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and University of Washington found conclusive evidence that omega-3 fatty acids corresponded to a reduced risk of death in the elderly, especially from cardiovascular disease. In older adults, higher blood levels of these fatty acids may even increase lifespan.
The study, published online in the Annals of Internal Medicine, looked at data across 16 years on 2,700 participants aged 65 or older, who were surveyed in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Cardiovascular Health Study.
Those with the highest bloods levels of omega-3s lived an average of 2.2 years longer than their counterparts with lower levels and faced a 27 percent lower risk of mortality.
In order to avoid the error and potential bias of self-reported estimates of fish intake, researchers used blood biomarkers to measure omega-3 levels. Unlike previous studies using such biomarkers, the researchers expanded the focus of study beyond heart health alone.
“Ours is the first study to assess how objectively measured omega-3 levels relate to total deaths, and deaths from multiple causes, in a general population,” wrote Dariush Mozaffarian, lead author of the paper and associate professor of epidemiology at HSPH, in an email.
Mozaffarian and his colleagues identified three fatty acids that appeared most responsible for observed reductions in mortality. Each was linked to a different ailment: coronary heart disease, nonfatal heart attack, or stroke.
“The higher levels of omega-3s in our study would correspond to about 3.5 oz. of farmed salmon, 5 oz. of anchovies or herring, or 15-18 oz. of cod or catfish per week,” wrote Mozaffarian. “The biggest bang-for-your-buck appears to be going from no intake to some.”
Mozaffarian suggested 400 milligrams—or two servings—of fatty or oily fish per week as a healthy option and added that fish oil supplements do not seem to be as effective.
Although dietary fat traditionally has a bad reputation, the HSPH study indicates that fat can actually be beneficial.
“Vegetable oil fats and fats from seafood are healthy,” wrote Mozaffarian. “Guidance should not be simply, ‘If you must eat fat, eat these fats,’ but ‘Increase the intakes of healthy fat, especially as a replacement for refined carbohydrates, starches, and sugars or unhealthy fats.’”
Existing studies have provided clues into the cellular and subcellular functions of omega-3s, but future research is needed to identify the specific genetic and molecular pathways affected by omega-3 fatty acids to better understand how they benefit human health.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard administration threatened to severely sanction a resident dean who shared with two students an internal email advising Administrative Board members on how to counsel undergraduates implicated in the Government 1310 cheating case, four College administrators said Monday.
Nearly a month after top administrators released a statement saying that the forwarded advising email was “an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach” by the resident dean in question, Cabot House Resident Dean Emily W. Stokes-Rees said that the administration gave a “strong indication that termination was a possibility” for her fellow resident dean at the time of the threat.
The threat is one of a number of concerns raised by resident deans since news broke last month that Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith and the University’s Office of the General Counsel authorized secret searches of the resident deans’ administrative email accounts in an attempt to stop what they later characterized as a leak of information, including the advising email, to the media.
Those concerns intensified after Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds told faculty at their monthly meeting last Tuesday that she had authorized an additional, previously unknown round of searches of the administrative and faculty email accounts of a single resident dean identified by the original search.
In a breach of FAS faculty email privacy policy, Hammonds did not notify Smith of the second search.
A College administrator familiar with the details of the investigation, who asked to remain anonymous because of its confidential nature, said that the resident dean was warned at the time of the searches in September that an additional mistake similar to the sharing of the advising email, even if accidental, would result in a severe sanction.
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment Monday night on the sanctions threatened against the resident dean in question.
Senior Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell and another resident dean who asked to remain anonymous said that the threat calls into question the accuracy of a March 11 statement by Smith and Hammonds which indicated that administrators decided “not to take further action” after the first round of searches of all the resident deans’ accounts.
“Although the Resident Dean’s actions violated the expectations of confidentiality surrounding the Administrative Board process, those involved in the review and the conversation with the individual were sufficiently convinced that it was an inadvertent error and not an intentional breach,” the statement read.
Howell, Stokes-Rees, the anonymous resident dean, and the College administrator all took issue with the characterization that the forwarding of the email was “inadvertent” and a “breach.”
The information in the advising email, authored by Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison, was intended to reach students implicated in the case, they say, and the resident dean in question was just trying to help students deciding whether or not to withdraw from the College.
“This was not an inadvertent forward; it was an advising moment,” Howell said. “I think this is something that any of us could have done.”
Howell added that the email did not include any confidential information, and thus did not amount to a “loss of confidentiality,” as Hammonds described it in her prepared remarks at last Tuesday’s faculty meeting.
The confidentiality statement attached to Ellison’s email indicates that it may “contain confidential or proprietary information and may be subject to confidentiality protections.” But it does not say that the email may not be forwarded by recipients, only specifying that unintended recipients “may not review, copy or distribute this message.”
Resident deans also contested Hammonds’s defense that she made her decision “to secure the confidentiality and integrity of the Ad Board’s process and prevent disclosures of student identities and cases to the media.” Implicit in that explanation, they said, is the suggestion that resident deans were not trusted to safeguard student privacy.
In order for resident deans to do their jobs, “students need to feel confident in our communication,” Howell said.
Stokes-Rees added that the searches have already created anxiety among some students, who are more hesitant to trust the confidentiality of their interactions with resident deans.
“I have students who I have corresponded with over the past few months becoming very, very nervous about whether the content of our correspondence could have been viewed, as well as parents of students expressing concern,” Stokes-Rees said.
In addition to the challenges posed by resident deans, Smith and Hammonds’s original March 11 statement contained a number of inconsistencies.
While it said that the searches had been limited to a subject-line query of the administrative email accounts of all resident deans, at last Tuesday’s faculty meeting, Hammonds cited her “failure to recollect” the additional queries, which included the names of Crimson reporters covering the Government 1310 case as search terms and probed both the administrative and faculty accounts of the resident dean identified in the first search.
In her remarks, Hammonds also said she had authorized that second search with the approval of the Office of the General Counsel. Neal declined to comment Monday night why the General Counsel did not correct the original statement.
Resident deans claimed that these continued inconsistencies offered by administrators, particularly Hammonds, have strained the trust so vital to the function of the Ad Board. Though they are not the only members, all resident deans sit on the Ad Board.
Stokes-Rees said the breach of trust between Hammonds and the resident deans is not irreparable, but will require each to be willing to work to a solution moving forward.
Hammonds made a public apology in her appearance at the faculty meeting last week, and though she has not yet addressed the resident deans as a group, she has begun to meet with them individually, Howell said.
The Ad Board is scheduled to meet for its regular meeting Tuesday afternoon for the first time since Hammonds announced the second round of searches.

When you hear the score 20-19, you might think of a close, hard-fought football game. Or maybe a basketball game halfway through the first quarter. But a baseball game? How crazy would that be?
Yet when the Harvard baseball team (6-21, 3-5 Ivy) faced off against Princeton (7-20, 5-3) on Sunday, the result was just that. Playing at O’Donnell Field in the second game of a doubleheader, the Crimson outlasted the Tigers in a wild nine innings and walked off in the bottom of the ninth to claim a 20-19 victory. The win was the team’s sixth of the year and third in Ivy League play.
Such an unusual game was filled with appropriately unique stats. Here’s a look at the epic showdown by the numbers.
2: Grand slams, one from sophomore infielder Tanner Anderson in the bottom of the sixth and another the very next inning from Princeton first baseman Mike Ford. Tigers catcher Tyler Servais also belted a grand slam in the first game of the doubleheader.
38: The number of hits in the slugfest, 23 for Harvard and 15 for Princeton. The Crimson’s previous season-high was 14 against Texas A&M-Corpus Christi.
9: Errors made in the game, with Harvard committing five and Princeton committing four. Despite the high error total, only six of the game’s 39 runs were unearned.
5: The number of Crimson batters who registered at least three hits. Freshman catcher DJ Link went 4-for-5, and sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel scored five runs.
11: The number of frames that teams scored in, with all but two coming as multiple-run innings (the high was Princeton’s seven-run second).
20: The number of runs Harvard scored, double its previous season high of 10 versus Cornell last weekend.
19: The number of runs Harvard runs allowed, six more than the season’s previous high of 13 that came just a few hours earlier in the first game of the day against Princeton.
3: Runs Harvard scored in the bottom of the ninth to win the game, all of which came on wild pitches.

It was certainly a week for rookie success in Harvard athletics, as the Athlete of the Week and the two runners-up are all freshmen. With back-to-back complete games helping the Crimson softball team to victories over Princeton and Cornell this past week, freshman pitcher Jamie Halula earned herself Athlete of the Week honors. Here are two other Harvard athletes that had excellent performances this past week:
DJ Link, baseball
Freshman DJ Link had 10 hits, four RBIs, and five runs scored in the Harvard baseball team’s four games over the weekend. Link was key in Harvard’s come-from-behind victory over Cornell in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader. With the Crimson down four going into the seventh inning, Link sparked a seven-run inning with a lead off walk and scored four batters later. Link was not done in the inning, however, as the Crimson were able to bat around. In his second trip to the plate, the freshman catcher smacked a single to right field to score two more runs. Link followed up Friday’s performance by registering a team-high four hits and scoring three runs in the Crimson’s wild 20-19 victory over Princeton on Sunday afternoon.
Charlotte Hendrix, women’s water polo
Playing in five games this week for the women’s water polo team, freshman Charlotte Hendrix ended the week with nine goals, 13 assists, and nine steals. In Sunday’s contest with Cal State Bakersfield, the rookie finished with a career-high 10 total points in Harvard’s 17-12 loss.  Those ten points consisted of three goals and seven assists, another career mark for the rookie. Just a day earlier, Hendrix helped the Crimson to a 12-6 victory over George Washington with three goals, an assist, and three steals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman pitcher Jamie Halula’s journey has only just begun.
After the Harvard softball team lost its two aces from last season, Halula—along with classmate Morgan Groom and sophomore Gabriele Ruiz—was thrown into a starting role directly out of high school, and she has been making the adjustment to college hitters in game situations since the beginning of non-conference play.
This weekend, Halula’s work paid off, as she delivered the best performances of her young career and led the Crimson to wins in both of her starts.
“I think she’s settling in,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “She hasn’t pitched her best of the year yet. She’s making the transition to the college game where the hitters are bigger and stronger, and the bats are more explosive, and she’s starting to turn a corner in terms of knowing what she needs to do.”
Pitching in the second games of two doubleheaders—against Princeton on Friday and Cornell on Saturday—the first-year threw two complete games that were both called after the fifth inning, when the mercy rule went into effect.
Sporting a 4.13 ERA—second only to Groom—Halula allowed a combined five earned runs on 13 hits, while walking five. The pair of wins brought her record up to 4-4 on the year.
Though Harvard scored a combined eight runs in its first-game losses this weekend, explosive offense in the second games of each doubleheader led to final scores of 11-3 and 11-2 against the Tigers and the Big Red, respectively.
Pitching in front of a high-scoring lineup was a change of pace for Halula, as she and the rest of the staff have often lacked the run support needed to pick up wins, despite strong performances. The Crimson—second to last in the Ivy League in runs scored with 83—has averaged just over three runs per nine innings in Halula’s four losses.
“It felt really good to have such a strong offense,” Halula said. “It was nice to be able to relax and pitch with the offense and the whole team behind you.”
Though the freshman had only three strikeouts on the weekend—all against Cornell—she relied on her location and control to prevent the opposition from squaring up on her pitches.
Halula kept hitters off balance through both games, which allowed her to work around mistakes and pitch out of pressure situations.
After she allowed two singles to Princeton in the top of the fifth and issued a two-out walk to load the bases, Halula induced a pop fly to left, which stranded the runners and ended the inning. Cornell had the bases loaded with one out in the fifth, but Halula shut down the rally with a pop-up to short and a fly ball to right. The Tigers and the Big Red left six and seven on base, respectively.
“What she had been doing earlier in the season was trying to overpower hitters, and then she would inevitably not be spinning the ball well,” Allard said. “Now she’s at a place where she’s really finessing the ball and doing a good job getting outs.”
Although she holds fewer strikeouts per game than her counterparts, the freshman averages a team-low 1.6 walks per game.
Despite a couple of rough outings early in the season, Halula has demonstrated poise in the clutch. She owns one save, when she came into the top of the seventh with a two-run lead against Rhode Island and pitched around two singles and one run to earn the Crimson a win.
Allard credited Halula’s success with her hard work so far this season, speaking to her competitive attitude and workhorse mentality that will likely help her continue improving.
“I think it was very hard for her in the preseason, when she was struggling to find her zone,” Allard said. “She wants to be given the ball and really step up for her team.”
Though Halula stood in the circle by herself this weekend, she credited her fellow pitchers with supporting her through the ups and down of the season.
The three pitchers have all shouldered a large portion of the burden in 2013. Groom holds a team-high 77.2 innings pitched, with Halula close behind at 64.1.
Even as a sophomore, Ruiz—whose innings were limited last season—is making a similar adjustment to the larger role as the two freshmen.
“We’re all going through the same thing at the same time, so if one of us is having bad day, the others are really supportive,” Halula said. “It’s really brought us together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard sailing team split up along the Charles over the weekend, as the Crimson competed in three regattas in the Boston area. Harvard picked up a sixth-place finish at the 45th Women’s President’s Trophy Intersectional, hosted by Boston University. The Crimson also finished in sixth at the Friis and Marchiando Trophies, held at MIT. Wrapping up its weekend schedule, Harvard took fourth as it hosted the Central Series Three Regatta.
“We’re pleased that the team continues to improve,” Crimson coach Michael O’Connor said. “In the team-racing regatta at MIT, we qualified for the gold round, and we were happy with that. We were not able to qualify for the final four, which was sort of our next goal. But we’re getting closer and closer to the top teams with our very young team.”
It was the fourth straight weekend of competition for the Crimson. The team looked to capitalize on its success from last weekend, when Harvard notched a victory at the Ted Ferrarone Team Race.
“Overall, the results were relatively good [for this weekend],” Slattery said. “I think we all showed a good amount of improvement from where we were just a few weeks ago. But [the results] also showed there’s work to be done.”
FRIIS AND MARCHIANDO TROPHIES
The Crimson went 6-8 at the intersectional regatta hosted by the Engineers, good for a sixth place showing in the 15-team field. Harvard opened the regatta with 5-2 records in both round robin events, advancing to the gold round. The Crimson posted victories against Boston College, MIT, Navy, and Michigan in both rounds. Harvard again finished with a 5-2 record in the first gold stage, but faltered to a 3-4 record in the second round.
“[It was] a very difficult team race,” sophomore Gram Slattery said. “The first day, our communication was extremely good. We managed to knock off Boston College every time we faced them, and they’re ranked third or fourth in the country right now. The next day, we didn’t do quite as well. We made some silly errors. It’s about minimizing errors more than it is making plays, and unfortunately we just made a few too many errors.”
Yale took home first place at the regatta with a 13-4 record on the weekend, edging out BC for the win. Stanford rounded out the top three at the event.
CENTRAL SERIES THREE REGATTA
At the Central Series Three Regatta, Harvard posted 101 points to edge Brown University in a tiebreaker for fourth place. In the A division, juniors Ames Lyman and Jacquelyn Cooley notched one victory along with three second-place finishes, and ended up with a total of 51 points. Senior Jinyan Zang and first-year Matthew Clarida posted a second-place finish in one of their races en route a 50-point total.
BC came in first with 62 points, while Connecticut College picked up 73 points to finish in second. The MIT squad came in third with 93 points.
45th WOMEN’S PRESIDENT’S TROPHY INTERSECTIONAL
In third and final regatta of the weekend, the Crimson’s 187 total points at the BU President’s Trophy just beat out BC for sixth place. In the A division races, juniors Morgan Russom and Caitlin Watson posted 85 points, while sophomore Ashleigh Inglis and freshman Sophie Bermudez put up 102 points in the B division.
Yale won the regatta by a wide margin. The Bulldogs’ 66-point total was almost half that of second place Tufts, which ended with 128 points. Roger Williams came in third, amassing 160 points on the weekend.
This weekend’s results mark the continuation of an upward trend for the Crimson. The team has steadily been on the rise for the past few weeks as the young squad gains experience from each weekend of competition.
“I think, over the course of the year, we came in with no one [who] could really perform at the intersectional level. It was really a struggle-fest,” Slattery said. “Now I think there are a bunch of skippers and crews that have really gotten a lot of confidence and have gotten a lot of good results too. At the beginning of the year, it was very intimidating. No one had a lot of experience at this level. We’ve gotten to the point where we know we can compete.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team hopes to break its longest losing streak of the season when it faces Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. this afternoon.
The Crimson (4-6, 1-2 Ivy) heads down to Connecticut today for its last non-conference matchup after hosting and losing its last three games, including a 14-12 loss to Cornell on Saturday. Harvard currently sits tied for fifth place in the Ivy League.
Quinnipiac (4-5, 1-1 NEC) moved to a shared third-place spot in the Northeast Conference after snapping a five-game losing streak with a 12-8 win over Mount St. Mary’s on Saturday.
“This is not an Ivy League game,” first-year atackman Devin Dwyer said. “But every game we play is important, especially coming off some tough loses.”
These two teams have faced each other four times before, with Harvard taking the victory in each match. Last year, the Bobcats came to Cambridge and fell to the Crimson, 18-4. In 2011, the score was 14-7.
“We beat them the last time,” Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “But they’re a very good team. They were very young last year, but they now have another year of experience.”
This spring, both teams have won the same number of games, four, but Harvard has tallied one more loss than its upcoming opponent.
In terms of common teams played, both squads have faced Bryant (No. 1 in NEC) and Brown (tied No. 5 in Ivy) this season. While QU lost, 17-7, on the road against conference rival Bryant back in March, the Crimson edged the Bulldogs, 7-5.
In the match-up against Brown, however, the tables were turned. The Bobcats took a 9-7 win over the Ivy team back in February, while Harvard fell short a few weeks later, losing by a final tally of 11-9.
But this one piece of evidence may not be enough to deny the strength of the Crimson team in the upcoming contest. Harvard’s regular-season opponents are arguably more competitive Div. I schools than those of Quinnipiac. For instance, in national standing, Cornell is No. 2, Duke is No. 7 and Princeton is No. 10. Additionally, the Crimson lost by no more than two goals to the Blue Devils and the Big Red. The Bobcats, on the other hand, have faced no ranked teams.
Numbers aside, Harvard knows what it needs to do in order to win.
“In the Cornell game, although we played well and had a lead, we just didn’t finish and close out the game,” Wojcik said. “We’re looking to not only play good lacrosse in the first three quarters, but then play with that same urgency and execute well in the fourth quarter. We’re looking to extend into a complete game.”
While the Bobcats are coming into this contest off of a solid win from the weekend, recent loses are motivating the Crimson to secure a win.
Wojcik was thoroughly pleased with his team’s performance on the field, despite the losses added in the record book. The greatest challenge for Harvard will be to close out the game.
“I think we have been playing really aggressively on both sides of the ball, we need to continue to do that, but do it for 60 minutes,” Wojcik said.
Also key for a victory is the squad’s mentality.
“We have to play confidently” Dwyer said. “I play with these guys every day in practice, and we try to play hard every day. We want to bring what we do in practice to the game, especially in the last 15 minutes in order to come out with a win.”
Junior attackman Peter Schwartz expressed another challenge that his team will face against Quinnipiac.
“It’s always tough going up on the road mid-week,” he said. “We have to stay focused and get ready to play.”
On the field, there isn’t one factor that Wojkic believes will be the determinant in a victory.
“We have a team-first approach,” he said. “We need every single guy on our team to do his job in order for us to be successful.”
Dwyer, a force on the offensive line for Harvard, attributes his success to his teammates’ hard work off-ball.
Heading into its last non-conference game, the Crimson is ready to break its losing streak.
“As long as we play the way our coach tells us to, by playing fast, playing confident, and playing smart to the best of our ability, we know that really no one can get in our way,” Dwyer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fewer than 24 hours after the conclusion of the 2013 NCAA tournament, CBS Sports began to look to the future.
That future looks bright for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
On Tuesday morning, CBSSports.com released its “Top 25 (and one): Way-too-early preseason rankings for 2013-14,” ranking the Crimson at No. 21.
Kentucky owns the top spot, while 2012-13 national champion Louisville came in at third. Harvard beat out 1-seed Indiana and Final Four shocker 9-seed Wichita State.The Crimson will return all but one player next season—senior guard and co-captain Christian Webster—and will likely add Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, as well as ESPN Top-100 recruit Zena Edosomwan.
This season’s top-scoring duo of sophomore forward Wes Saunders and freshman point guard Siyani Chambers come back looking to build on past success.
Though the Crimson did not break into the national rankings this season, it made history by winning the first NCAA tournament game in program history, beating Mountain West Conference champion New Mexico, 68-62, in the second round in Salt Lake City.
Two seasons ago, Harvard was ranked for the first time in program history, starting at No. 25 in the AP poll in December and moving up to No. 22 in January. The team also enjoyed a No. 21 ranking in the coaches poll in February of 2012.

Welcome to "Listen Up!," Flyby's weekly advice column, written by two jobless, washed-up seniors from their futon in Winthrop.
We recently received a question submission that went as follows: "Oppam Gangnam Style!"
 
Just to clarify, this is not actually a question. As in, if you submitted that as your weekly discussion question for section, you would fail (a.k.a. get a B-).
 
When we found ourselves questionless last week, we decided to create a focus group of Harvard students (i.e. we lured our friends to our suite with wine and M&Ms) to discuss some key questions facing our generation. After breezing through gay marriage, world hunger, and gun control, it was romantic interactions that most stumped our participants. This was not surprising: some studies show that five out of the five students who read this column do so primarily for advice about their love lives. 
While we wait for you to actually send us some questions—you know, like sentences using a question mark—we are going to offer up some unsolicited advice on general topics of interest:
Long Distance Relationships: Really Don't Last
 
All couples in a long distance relationship think that theirs will be the one that works. "We are the exception," they say, gazing into each others' eyes on the computer screen as they enter their third consecutive hour on Skype. You aren't the exception. No one is. Break up now.
 
We know, we know, it seems like a good idea. Why would you break up with the person you love just because of a silly thing like distance? Here's why: distance is a bitch. It will turn you into a crazy, depressed person who is constantly texting, calling, Skyping, and crying.
 
Never thought you were the jealous type? Just wait until you meet your long distance girlfriend's male neighbor in a dorm that has unisex bathrooms. Didn't think you were clingy? In two months you'll be convinced that a twenty minute lag time in your long distance boyfriend's text response is the beginning of the end of your relationship.
 
Sometimes, you will try to eat meals or watch the same movie while video chatting with each other, like you're on a real date! But you aren't. You are miles apart. Our advice? "Exception" is just another word for "catastrophe."
 
We will give you long distance relationshippers one thing though: absence, and abstinence, tend to make the heart grow fonder. Also, you get more mail.
 
Sexiling: A Crime of Passion
Let's face it: there's really no good way to handle this rite of passage. However, our requisite freshman focus group member did have one suggestion that he and his roommates have successfully employed: the guilty party is required to spend a day walking around campus wearing a Yale hat. Maybe a little cruel and unusual, but we think that sounds fair.
 
 
Age Differences, or Does 1/2 (Your Age) + 7 = Compatible?
 
Susan Patton, an alumna of Princeton, recently wrote a rather horrifying letter to The Daily Princetonian about how we all need to get on board the husband-finding train, like, right now. We take issue with her central thesis, but we also would like to address another theory of Ms. Patton's: that senior women can't date younger men. Ms. Patton writes, "So, by the time you are a senior, you basically have only the men in your own class to choose from, and frankly, they now have four classes of women to choose from."
 
You are horribly mistaken, Ms. Patton. This is not a Jane Austen novel and we are not past our prime at the age of 22. Taylor Swift even wrote a song about how great it is to be 22, and we'll take her dating advice over yours any day. She has made millions by dating younger men and then breaking up with them.
 
So here's our consensus: do what you please, just stay out of the Yard. Or, as we like to call it, "The Playpen." Seniors, think about it this way: when you were on FOP, the Freshman was planning a sweet sixteen party. When you took the SATs, the Freshman was at a bar mitzvah. When you were at your bar/bat mitzvah, the Freshman was learning how to tell time. Freshmen aren't a good look on anyone but other freshmen, and that goes for both men and women.
All other class years are fair game. There are actually some great benefits to dating younger. Sophomores and Juniors are more likely to still have an optimistic view about their time at Harvard. They aren't stressing about jobs and real life yet. They are also more likely to live in DeWolfe, which is air conditioned—a nice amenity for the three days out of the school year during which you need it.

Today may have been Free Cone Day, but the more-than-usual goodness is lasting all month at our local Ben & Jerry's. People in Harvard Square now have a new option for delicious food that will satisfy both their physical hunger and their desire to do good. PBHA has teamed up with Ben & Jerry's to offer a new flavor of ice cream called "What-SUP." The flavor is being offered as part of Ben & Jerry's April Mash-Up Flavor of the Month. A mix of chocolate fudge brownie ice cream and small pieces of cookie dough and brownie bits, it will be available for the whole month of April—with all proceeds going to PBHA's Summer Urban Program (SUP). SUP runs 10 summer camps for children living in the Boston area and serves over 800 kids each year.
So next time you're craving ice cream, fret not. You should have absolutely no guilt about indulging in this stuff. What-SUP, chocolate-y goodness?

Spring brings with it those colorful yet expensive lawn chairs, round two of midterms and exams, and, for the first time this year, the frequent sighting of pedicabs. A mix of bicycle and chariot, pedicabs are an alternative way to tour or travel through the Cambridge and Boston landscape. Typically seating two people, the cabs are are clean, green, and follow a "pay-as-you-please" scheme (if you're lucky). Where can you go with a pedicab? Here are just a few ideas.
The Quad:
Let's face it. That 15 minute walk can be tough some days. The shuttles are great, but they don't always come on time, and when they do, people tend to be packed like sardines. It's rough. Imagine what life would be like if you could just hop on a pedicab at 10:02 a.m. and get to class on time without breaking a sweat. Good, that's what.
The Stadium:
You know you're going to exercise when you get to the stadium anyways, so you might as well take it easy and have a pleasant ride across the river. Alternatively, get your own pedicab and ride ride it there and back for a strenuous bonus workout.
Vanserg:
Are you one of those students who has class at Boylston and then has to get to Vanserg immediately afterwards? The commute may seem brutal, but you'd probably enjoy it a lot more (and actually get to class on time) if you were to take a pedicab.
The Charles River:
Date idea: You and your lover take a pleasant ride along the Charles River, watch people run by, cheer for our crew team, and maybe even stop and have a picnic now that the weather seems to be getting better.
Salem or Plymouth Rock:
Salem is only about 20 miles away, and Plymouth Rock is about 40 miles away. If we assume that a pedicab goes at the rate of 10 miles per hour, then you'd be able to get to Salem in around two hours, and Plymouth Rock in around four hours. Of course, this all depends on Boston's traffic… and of course… the stamina of your pedicab driver. But both Salem and Plymouth are great options if you're looking to get away from the college bubble. Warning: this may be expensive.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and other schools too).
While Harvard traverses the murky and scandalous waters of cheating and lying, Yale's biggest scandal of late concerns duck penises. Apparently, some (mostly right-wingers) aren't too happy that the National Science Foundation has dropped a cool $384,949 so that Yale scientists can investigate "Sexual Conflict, Social Behavior and the Evolution of Waterfowl Genitalia." What exactly are they going to do with all that money, you may be asking? Hopefully, they'll answer that pressing question of just how much duck penises shorten or lengthen depending on the time of year, the age of the duck, and its "social environment" (we'll leave it up to you to figure out what that means). Fascinating.
Over in New Jersey, something that's definitely lengthening is Princeton's Thanksgiving break. As of 2013, Princeton will have an extra day tacked on to their November break. Welcome to the five day club, friends.
Back in the realm of questionably worthwhile scientific pursuits, a Dartmouth study recently concluded that there is no single sexy chin shape. Really, guys, anything goes! So if you've been spending sleepless nights worrying that you're a freak because you're a fan of both the pointy and the square, you can finally put your mind at rest.
While Cornell hasn't produced much of note lately, it was ranked fifth on Buzzfeed's "Elite 10 Smart Party Schools" list. Despite the, erm, hard partying ways of our friends in Ithaca, their acceptance rate for the Class of 2017 still proved to be the least competitive of all the Ivies, and boy wasn't that sure to get their well-documented inferiority complex kicking in once again. An op-ed in The Cornell Daily Sun addressed students' concerns that the school is less prestigious than its Ivy peers, then ultimately concluded that Cornell is the "best Ivy League school" out there.
While that's something that no study could prove, we do know empirically that Cornell isn't topping anyone's list of dream schools. Sorry 'bout that.
