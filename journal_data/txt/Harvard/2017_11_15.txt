After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How might a cast and crew stage different forms of disability for contemporary theater audiences? How might those theatergoers respond to the approach that a given production takes? And what might all of the people involved—behind the scenes, onstage, and in the audience—learn in the process?
These are important and timely questions, percolating through both scholarly and popular discourse on including, valuing, and exploring a variety of human experiences in the theater. In the last few months, productions like Manhattan Theatre Club’s “Cost of Living” by Martyna Majok and Sam Gold’s Broadway revival of “The Glass Menagerie” by Tennessee Williams have generated critical buzz for casting both disabled and able-bodied actors to tell difficult, viscerally wrenching stories. Other recent plays, in contrast, have featured well-known, able-bodied actors as their eponymous, physically disabled protagonists, such as Bradley Cooper in “The Elephant Man” and Daniel Radcliffe in “The Cripple of Inishmaan.” Still other shows, like the musical “Side Show” and Deaf West Theatre’s revival of “Spring Awakening,” have brought together music and issues of disability, to varying degrees of box office success. I flag these examples not to critique one approach or another, but rather to illustrate that directors have responded in many ways to the ongoing questions about staging disability.
“Frank Steins,” an original play by Brandon Martinez ’20 that ran at the Loeb Experimental Theater from Nov. 9-12, likewise placed a disabled character at the heart of its story. The title “Frank Steins” seems to allude to the novel “Frankenstein,” although the play never fleshed out that parallel. Presented by Harvard College TEATRO!—in conjunction with Harvard College Disability Alliance, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, the Office for the Arts, and the Undergraduate Council—and in partnership with Partners for Youth with Disabilities, the play centered on the young man Frank Steins (Agustín A. Rodríguez López ’19) and his physical disability (which, we learn sporadically, is Duchenne muscular dystrophy). The play also highlighted the internal struggles of Steins’ mind, played by Janiah Lockett ’20, and the inability of his parents and assisted living caregivers to understand and communicate with him and with each other. “Frank’s in a place in his life where he needs love and support; and everywhere he turns, he sees no one there, no community that loves him,” Martinez writes in the director’s note.
Shows like “Frank Steins” do not present the audience with burdenless characters and carefree plotlines. Instead, this theater is hard to wrap the brain around, often convoluted in the delivery of its messages, and even sometimes downright skeevy to watch. It is challenging, for example, to suspend disbelief when López, an able-bodied actor, often broke character, standing up from Steins’ wheelchair to help the small cast move some of the props offstage. Were considerations made to cast a disabled actor in the role, and how would that choice have affected audience response? It is uncomfortable to hear trite platitudes spouted by Frank’s mother, Mary (Ekemini Ekpo ’20), as she attempted to emancipate Frank from the assisted living facility. Logic-wise, why she allowed him to go there, despite her ensuing ire for the place, I think I’ll leave for another time. It is unnerving to see how the blocking of this play required the limping, war veteran Doctor (Shannon Beattie ’20) and the cocky and grating Eamon Star (Francisco J. Cernada ’20) to drop Frank with a thud on the Loeb Ex’s floor, as they failed to lift him from the wheelchair to his bed offstage. Doesn’t that fall hurt him?
Such voyeuristic discomfort cannot be explained away as merely the result of Martinez’s long-winded approach to staging disability in “Frank Steins.” Indeed, this play, like some others, seems to present knotty issues—change, choice, circumstance—to the audience so we can grapple with them long after the curtain falls. I can't help thinking about a sentence from Zora Neale Hurston’s novel “Their Eyes Were Watching God” here. Swapping Hurston's “years” with “plays” for our purposes, Hurston writes: “There are [plays] that ask questions and [plays] that answer.” It seems to me that some productions which attempt to stage disability for contemporary audiences fall into the former category, posing thought-provoking, perhaps sometimes unresolvable, questions.

The Harvard Ballet Company and the Brattle Street Chamber Players have come together to produce the show “In Passage,” a journey that explores the themes of migration and home through music and dance. With a beautifully ethereal original score by Sam Wu ’17 and skilled direction by Alexandra Caffrey ’19 and Alison J. Garber ’19, “In Passage” is a successful collaborative effort that expertly weaves student choreography and a unique sound, holding the full attention of the audience until the curtain has dropped.
The dancers of the Harvard Ballet Company move like professionals. They dance with lightness and grace, turning hours of practice and rehearsal into seemingly effortless execution, and the choreography is done with immaculate execution.The opening movement, “the exuberance of beginning,” begins the journey of migration with a whimsical welcome from 22 dancers running across the stage. More dissonant and anxious movements later contrast with this grand opening. In the eighth movement, “lone bird, in moonlight, clouds of silver,” two pairs of dancers engage in a form of combat, pushing and pulling until they finally come to rest in each other’s arms.The ballet provides moments of both grandeur and solemnity.
The original score by Wu is a work of art. The depth and complexity of each piece is palpable.The score showcases a wide variety of compositional techniques and influence, ranging from the whimsy of Debussy to the harsh sardonic of Shostakovich. The Brattle Street Chamber Players bring this amazing score to life with a resonating vitality. The music is not just a part of the show but a performance in its own right. Led by conductors Gordon V. Ma ’19 and Reuben Stern ’20, the orchestra executes to perfection. The violinists, including John Lim ’20 and Diana Wang ’20, provide the bone-shaking altos while cello (Audrey Chen ’18) and viola (Faith A. Pak ’19, an active Crimson editor) solos provide the deeper tones of the ensemble.
The set is intentionally minimalistic. With a white backdrop that changes colors for each movement, the focus is on the dancers and music. The costume design is also simple. Still, the performers do go through a number of costume changes, each providing more range of movement than the previous. The lighting design also accentuates the production flawlessly. The final movement is a prime example: The show ends with the performers becoming dark silhouettes, juxtaposed against a light purple background, closing this incredible journey with a fitting finale.
The dancing, music, and production of “In Passage” all contribute to a spectacle of migration and transformation. The Harvard Ballet Company and the Brattle Street Chamber Players have produced an excellent work of art and will hopefully continue to collaborate in the future.

With Harvard Law School overhauling its advising and mentorship programs, it is fitting that we examine the College’s own programs, in particular its freshmen advising programs. Before freshmen even step foot on Harvard’s campus to begin their first year, they are matched with a peer advising fellow and an academic advisor as their core advising system. These matches are made on the basis of student responses to general questionnaires. However, there is extreme variance in the satisfaction freshmen have with their advisors. Because of this, we encourage Harvard College administrators to adopt a more flexible advising system, particularly for freshmen.
The aforementioned matching is based on questionnaires freshmen complete the summer before they arrive at the College. After the first year, the crux of the student advising system shifts to concentration advisors, with sophomores briefly dependent on sophomore advisors within their Houses before declaring their concentrations officially come November. The discrepancies within College advising, then, lies largely in the first-year experience.
Some freshmen begin college with a clear understanding of the academic and professional interests they intend to pursue. For these students, we suggest that they be matched with advisors who are qualified with knowledge of that field or career. Others come in with only vague, transient thoughts of what they want to pursue in college and beyond. Students in this position should be able to be matched with advisors based on their incoming interests. However, the College should make it much easier for freshmen in both positions to switch advisors, especially academic advisors, at any point in the first year should their interests change.
Additionally, academic advisors should have a better understanding of the undergraduate course system, especially courses first years may take. If advisors do not have experience in their advisees’ desired field of study, they should be able to point them to resources and individuals who can better inform and guide them. PAFs should also clearly present themselves as academic support systems to their advisees. While many academic advisors did not attend Harvard for their undergraduate education, every PAF is also a Harvard College student, and should establish a baseline of familiarity for their advisees with how to navigate Harvard as an institute of higher education, not just as a social space.
That said, we do want to remind freshmen that you can seek help navigating Harvard beyond the PAF and academic advisor you are assigned. You can create opportunities by joining clubs, emailing professors, and contacting older students to get the advice you need, especially if your existing advising system does not meet your needs.
All in all, freshmen year is when students’ academic careers are the most in flux and the advising systems they rely on must be similarly flexible. Harvard should look to be able to quickly adapt to freshmen’s changing needs and interests, efficiently answering questions and providing guidance to help them along their formative year at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sad bagels. Meager cereal. Lackluster fruits. Brain break has not been Harvard University Dining Services’ best work lately. One particularly disappointing night last week, I spent a few minutes standing by the Quincy House brain break. In the span of a few minutes, multiple students walked in, glanced at the desolate display, sighed, and left. Some students studying in the dining hall brought in outside food and others waited downstairs for the grille to open. Several of my friends outright refused to go to brain break with me, saying there was little there to eat.
We talk a lot at Harvard about how to foster community, ensure inclusion, and encourage engagement. In addition to House events, House neighborhood events, entryways study breaks, College-sponsored social events, the University even has a Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging. In the end, all of these initiatives, task forces, and programs are about fostering community. They are about making people feel at home in their spaces.
Yet there is an extraordinarily simple way for the College to take a step toward achieving this. It won’t cost too much, won’t require any new programs, and I believe it will create happier students, closer-knit friendships, and better House life. What is it? Improving brain break.
The College has done this before. Since February 2016, Annenberg Hall has expanded its brain break offerings, including hot meals and later closing times. Undergraduate Council representatives have pushed for this as a way to build a more cohesive freshman class. Last year, when I was a freshman, the special brain breaks featuring grilled cheese, pancakes, or ice cream were the most widely attended. They became hubs of activity. I would bring my roommates, catch up with friends, and relax. If this initiative worked for the freshmen, why not expand this to include the Houses and why not make it routine?
The recipe is simple: Students, especially late at night, like food. Clubs know this, which is why our inboxes are buried under a deluge of emails promising free cookies and pizza for attending meetings. House Faculty Dean events, after all, probably turn out large numbers of students in no small part due to their homemade goods. Imagine if brain break resembled that, even in the slightest.
Why is Lamont Cafe, nestled inside a library students love to hate, often bustling with activity into the wee morning hours, while the Houses lack the same vibrancy? I would bet it’s the food. House grilles often serve as communal gathering spots late into the evenings when they are open. Meanwhile, Yale has its own system of grilles, called butteries, in each house that open at night. Students call them the best part of the school.
House dining halls are open for the duration of the night. They are expansive common spaces, ripe for the fostering of collaboration and cohesiveness. Yet they lack the bustle they should have.
Here is my suggestion: One night a week—I suggest Thursday—HUDS should upgrade brain breaks in the Houses. It will work well after community dinner, and many students have fewer classes on Fridays. Serve any variety of food, just anything better than the meager fare served now. I would bet that students would turn out in much greater numbers. They would turn the dining halls into the centers of commotion that they should be.
Imagine the dining halls as places to meet those friends from across the hall and bond over shared interests. They could be the foundations for building the cohesive House communities we aspire to have. Picture your dining hall, each week, filled with students late into the night. This could happen.
As an example, take the weekly Physics Night in Leverett House. With better food, the whole dining hall fills with activity. Friends from Quincy head there instead of our own dining hall for brain break. Every House could look like this.
Maybe then the College can achieve its dreams of turning the Houses into centers of student communities. Think about that. With better brain breaks, anything is possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, President Donald Trump’s Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida hired 70 foreign workers, legally employable through H2-B visas. Trump has been highly critical of companies relocating overseas to cheapen labor costs, and of Obama-era immigration policy he believes were too lenient, but his team justified the move by claiming that “no one else wanted the jobs.” A spokesman for CareerSource, a company that connects businesses seeking employees with those seeking work, disputes that, writing that more than 5,000 Floridians were available to fill the positions. Furthermore, the hotel has faced criticism in the past for making the hiring process for Americans exceedingly difficult—applications from locals had to be sent in by fax, and no phone number or email was advertised. In August, Mar-A-Lago requested permission from the Labor Department to hire foreign workers before it even began advertising in the country.
So much of Trump’s platform rests on the idea that immigration is bad for the country: From the proposal of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, he has shown ideological opposition to immigration to be a hallmark of his presidency (though apparently, different rules apply when his companies are involved).
But Trump didn’t introduce anti-immigration sentiment to the U.S—it’s been prevalent in the country since our founding. Especially in the past 20 years, Midwestern voters have aligned themselves with conservative immigration policy, but feel especially vindicated by Trump’s blunt criticism of immigrants and Obama’s immigration policies. Ohio has the least inclusive and most dangerous immigration policy in the country, and Indiana is tied for second-worst. Most Midwestern states have similar tendencies.
Fear-inciting rhetoric surrounding immigration works well in the region often because rural towns in the Midwest are overwhelmingly white. Rural communities, on average, have an immigrant population of a little over two percent, while immigrants account for almost 15 percent of the population in urban counties. People accustomed to homogeneity are more easily convinced that the lack thereof is dangerous. Unacquainted with people who look or live differently than themselves, they are unable to imagine their community surviving change.
But this mentality can’t account for the entire region. Due to low costs of living, availability of space, and high employment, other places in the Midwest are havens for immigrants and refugees. Nebraska houses more refugees per capita than any other state, and despite the lack of resources for immigrants in states such as Michigan and Ohio, each of these states are in the top five for highest refugee population overall. State governments in the Midwest encourage immigration from foreigners to their states, as the decline of some industries in the Rust Belt necessitates economic stimulus, and the resulting emigration of its native-born residents creates employment opportunities.
Thus, urban Midwesterners, especially older ones, see a thinning out of white Christians like them, who they recognize and trust, and an influx of people of color who they don’t. While plenty of successful immigrants and people of color live in more urban areas and coastal states, racial income inequality is at its worst in the Midwest. The five cities with the largest gap between black and white earnings are all in Midwestern states.
Using immigrants for economic stimulus then failing to create a suitable living environment for them has become a hallmark of Midwestern legislation. Taxpayers, generally critical of immigrants, are unwilling to spend money on public health or education initiatives that would benefit immigrant populations, but readily welcome the contributions they provide to the local economy through both low-skilled and high-skilled work.
State governments realize this, and have begun to pass policy accordingly; since the election, state senates have introduced an abundance of bills regarding stricter immigration and refugee policy. As a result of these measures, on both state and federal levels, the states that depend upon immigrants the most will find themselves responsible for their own demise. Businesses and communities that have flourished because of the work of immigrants will be drained of vitality, unable to find a solution. On the bright side, maybe Mar-A-Lago, finding it “very, very hard” to find American workers, will go out of business.

On the front steps of Boylston Hall, Will H. MacArthur ’20 poses—or tries to pose—for a portrait. After several awkward attempts, he laughs and gives up. MacArthur ran for a seat on the Cambridge School Committee in the November 7 municipal election, and while his campaign was unsuccessful, he’s not taking the loss too hard.
“My personal well-being might not necessarily be maximized by being on the School Committee as compared to being in college. On a very individual level, I’m not distraught,” MacArthur says. That said, he worries that the re-election of every incumbent who ran means that the school committee is unlikely to see meaningful change. “On a community level, I was sad that I didn’t win.”
MacArthur was one of two sophomores who ran in Cambridge’s recent municipal election; Nadya T. Okamoto ’20 ran for a seat on Cambridge’s City Council. Her campaign, too, was unsuccessful.
Yet Okamoto says she found solace in the election’s large voter turnout. Excitedly, she scrolls through a series of maps displaying the increase in voter turnout in Precinct 2, Ward 2. Voter turnout in this area, which is almost entirely occupied by MIT students, increased by 252.8 percent since 2015—the largest increase of any Cambridge precinct. “That was what I was celebrating today,” Okamoto says.
Indeed, running for City Council hasn’t always been Okamoto’s goal. She only became involved in Cambridge politics six months before she began her campaign, and says she quickly grew passionate about local issues. “This seems to be the only way that people are going to listen to what I have to say,” she says.
Many Cambridge residents, however, were dubious.
“She was heavily criticized from the get-go—and we knew this—for not being from Cambridge,” Okamoto’s campaign director Claira P. Janover ’20 says. “I really wanted people to see that there’s something really strong about telling people that they can run for office regardless of circumstance.”
MacArthur’s campaign faced the same challenge: His press director and former Cambridge Rindge and Latin School classmate Diego L. Lasarte, a student at Bowdoin, describes aspects of the campaign process as a “quest to justify your Cambridge chops.”
“People are very defensive when it comes to outsiders coming into their city,” Lasarte says. While campaigning for MacArthur, Lasarte made a point to always mention MacArthur’s status as a lifelong Cantabrigian and a graduate of CRLS before saying that he was a Harvard student.
But MacArthur’s deep roots in Cambridge didn’t make campaigning any easier for him. He remembers holding signs and meeting Cambridge residents in Porter Square several weeks prior to the election. When he introduced himself and said “I’m running for school committee” to a passerby, he was met with a brisk “I don’t care.” This was a common response.
“I legitimately laughed,” MacArthur says. “That sums up so much about how people engage with school committee politics.”
While MacArthur doesn’t plan to run in future local elections, he intends to stay involved in Cambridge politics. “I’m perfectly happy continuing to make a difference in Cambridge outside of elected office, and being a student here,” he says. “I’ve got my Participatory Budgeting shirt. My next goal is to get turnout for that.”
His t-shirt, which reads “PB Cambridge,” refers to the $800,000 in the city budget that is allocated by popular vote. The vote is open to all Cambridge residents who are at least 12 years old, including non-U.S. citizens and university students. In years past, youth turnout has been low.
Okamoto has a similar attitude. “I’ve already started emailing a lot of the people who were elected and community leaders I met to be like, ‘What can we do now? What do you think is the best way I can channel my efforts?’” she says. “If you’re living here, you’re part of the community, whether you like it or not.”

The Undergraduate Council held phone banking sessions on Monday and Tuesday to advocate against a provision of the proposed Congressional tax bill that would cost the University millions.
Undergraduate Council members urged students to gather in Boylston Hall to call members of Congress about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, though the event was sparsely attended. The proposed legislation includes a tax on university endowments that would, based on its investment income this year, cost Harvard an estimated $43 million. The bill is currently being debated in the Senate.
The proposed tax would be levied on some private universities and has the potential to decrease financial aid and research funding, according to UC President Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18.
“We are doing this to protect our community and protect the people in our community,” she said. “We are going to call our senators and ask them to remove this portion of the bill.”
Over the past year, University President Drew G. Faust has lobbied members of Congress to keep an endowment tax out of the bill. At a Faculty meeting last week, Faust said she has contacted alumni and donors who might be able to influence the bill.
Sachee said that Faust notified UC leadership of the issue, sparking their decision to hold the phone banking sessions. As a nonpartisan organization, the UC has not taken an official stance on the rest of the legislation, she added.
“This is not an endorsement or anyone saying that we are against the whole bill,” she said. “This is just against this part.”
Winthrop House Representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 said he supports political action from the UC only on issues that affect the student body.
“It is important to distinguish between trying to represent the student body and trying to make sure we are protecting our fellow students,” he said. “ On issues of political engagement that protect our students, I think it is totally valid for the Undergraduate Council to speak out about those issues.”
Veronica Santana ’21 said she was unaware of the tax bill’s implications for Harvard until a freshman UC representative invited her to the phone bank.
“I think it is important that our college campus eases you into being a good citizen and doing your part and calling your senator and representative about things that you are passionate about,” she said.
The UC is currently holding elections to choose its next president and vice president. Voting closes Thursday at noon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Labor advocate Valarie Long—who helps lead the 2 million-strong Service Employees International Union—argued for racial justice as a path to achieve broader economic justice at a Law School event Tuesday.
Long, who serves as executive vice president of the union, spoke for roughly half an hour Tuesday afternoon at a forum titled “Justice in the Service Economy” and hosted by the Harvard Law Forum. She discussed the work her union does, as well as current challenges confronting the labor movement in the United States.
She opened her talk by detailing how her union represents workers across a wide range of industries: She said the group works with government employees, health workers, and property service workers like janitors.
But Long spent most of the afternoon advocating for racial justice.
“The premise at SEIU is that you really can’t get economic justice if you don’t have racial justice,” she said. “It seems to me that we always go around race in this country, and how can you ever really understand how to get justice for folks if you don’t confront race?”
She went on to assert that the right to vote—which she termed the most essential right to achieve racial justice—has recently come under threat from the federal government.
“We have to have a long-term view about enfranchisement [for] our members, mostly black and brown,” she said. “There are so many laws on the books, and those laws are significantly being challenged in the Supreme Court around the very right for folks to cast their vote.”
Long said she was hopeful that the union and its allies could turn what she called the current “tide” of American politics.
She also devoted much of her speech to what she called the progressive movement as a whole in the United States. She said that movement has suffered over the past several decades due to internal divisions and she called for greater unity going forward.
“We have been siloed in our progressive movement. We have the immigrant movement, the criminal justice movement, the labor movement. It hasn’t worked...We need to join forces with folks who have like interests and common cause,” Long said.
Roughly 25 Harvard affiliates attended the event. One attendee, Cara J. Kupferman ’20, said she agreed with Long’s emphasis on racial justice as a way to achieve broader economic justice for workers in the United States.
“Especially given the current political moment, there is a more pressing interest in looking at issues of labor justice through lenses of racial justice and combining different movements to work for collective liberation,” Kupferman said.

This is part VI in a six-part series on Harvard's next president. Part I can be read here, part II can be read here, part III can be read here, part IV can be read here, and part V can be read here.
In her ten years at Harvard’s helm, University President Drew G. Faust has traveled the world. But as her tenure comes to a close, one trip stands out in her mind: her visit to Vietnam earlier this year, roughly half a century after the height of the Vietnam War.
There, Faust chatted with the country’s prime minister, paid her respects at a Vietnamese military cemetery in Ap Bac, and gave a speech to a standing-room-only crowd in Ho Chih Minh City. A Southern history scholar by trade, Faust drew parallels between the enduring scars of the Civil War in the United States and the Vietnam War there.
Apart from reflecting on Vietnam’s history, though, Faust also took stock of the role Harvard is actively playing to shape its future. Fulbright University Vietnam—one stop on Faust’s busy itinerary—grew out of a Kennedy School master’s program, and has flourished with the University’s support.
"I just thought, ‘Wow, Harvard really was instrumental in helping this nation figure out how to get on the path to prosperity and growth that it’s so dynamically on right now.’ And that was just really exciting to see,” Faust said in November.
From Botswana to Brazil, Harvard has both broadened and deepened its international commitments under Faust. And as the presidential search committee combs the world for her successor, some say that Harvard’s potential as a global university should weigh heavily on their minds.
On the one hand, Harvard has opened research centers and offices in regions around the world over the past decade, including new outposts in Tunisia, South Africa, and India. In 2015, Faust oversaw the creation of the Harvard Global Institute, which convenes students and faculty across the University to foster collaboration with international scholars. The Global Advisory Council—a continent-spanning body of alumni started by Corporation member David M. Rubenstein—has raised millions to support international initiatives in Faust’s capital campaign, a tentpole of her legacy.
“This was another sort of ‘One University, One World’ strategy—and this group has been extraordinarily successful and enormously helpful,” Faust said of the Council in November.
On the other hand, though, Harvard has long been reticent to establish a satellite campus abroad—a step a number of its peer institutions have already taken. Though Faust has said Harvard seeks to be intentional in its overseas expansion effort, some wonder if the University’s global strategy is deliberate enough in comparison to its peer schools’ engagement overseas.
As Harvard searches for a leader to articulate the school’s international plans, some, like Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott, hope the next decade will see the University’s worldwide presence amplified.
“I am hopeful that the next president will continue to support the continued growth of the university’s global reach, as Drew Faust has done particularly these days when there are louder voices calling for walls to be built, and for free movement of talent to be curtailed which is a threat to the university’s existence,” he said.

Yale has a campus in Singapore, and New York University has one in Dubai. Duke opened a campus in Kunshan, China in 2013. And at the “Education City” complex in Qatar, students can study in programs operated by Cornell, Georgetown, and Northwestern.
But unlike its peers, Faust has said, Harvard has no such plans to open any international campuses. “What we really wanted to do internationally was to have our students and faculty be part of the community and the nation in which they found themselves, rather than be a part of an artificial Harvard-imposed community in another country,” Faust said.
“Think globally, act locally,” is the University’s mantra when it comes to overseas expansion, Elliott agreed. Rather than opening up its own branch campuses in other countries, Harvard prefers to support its own smaller regional offices or partner with other local universities.
That doesn’t mean that Harvard has been slacking on the international front, said Todd Washburn, Harvard’s senior assistant provost for international affairs. As result of Harvard’s historically decentralized structure, Washburn said, its international endeavors may not always be widely recognized.
“Our global activity is managed at the local level, at the school level, at the center level, at the department level, at the level of the individual faculty member or the students in some cases,” said Washburn. “But Harvard at the institutional level is not making one single big bet or big investment, so it’s sometimes hard for people to see all that the University is doing internationally.”
Under Faust, the University has established outposts in Dubai, Tunis, and Shanghai, among other cities. According to the Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs, the school also plans to open an office affiliated with the South Asia Institute in Delhi, India later this year.
Over the last few years, Harvard has placed special emphasis on building stronger connections with Asia. The Global Institute’s first initiative, through the Harvard Center in Shanghai, dedicated $3.75 million to supporting climate change research in China. In March, Faust traveled to Southeast Asia, visiting national leaders, educators, alumni, and students in Singapore and Vietnam.
From Cambridge, too, Harvard has sought to make courses available to a global audience. While having physical presence abroad is one important pillar of global outreach, the development of HarvardX has also made high-quality courses accessible around the world online, said  Martin Puchner, an English and Comparative Literature professor.

Harvard enjoys worldwide name recognition—according to the World University Rankings, a survey conducted by the Times of London, it’s the planet’s most reputable school. This international prominence, some say, calls for a leader willing to step up as a global figure.
Rye M. Barcott '09, an elected director of the Harvard Alumni Association, emphasized the need for the president to undertake a dual leadership role both at home and abroad, representing higher education on the international stage.
“We shouldn’t forget that for the vast majority of the world, a college degree is still inaccessible and there’s tremendous growth overseas in education,” Barcott said. “We need to keep in mind hiring someone who has the skills to lead locally, but also globally.”
Jack O. Bovender—the chair of Duke University’s board of trustees who also led Duke’s recent presidential search—echoed this sentiment, noting that top universities have the responsibility to think in a “global sense” and “not just in a local, U.S.-only kind of way.”
Harvard’s next leader will also have to deal with increasing worldwide competition for higher education as a result of globalization, Elliott said. “But,” he added, “it’s not a zero-sum game, because more and more people are seeking higher ed.”
At home, under a presidential administration whose policies threaten the ability of foreign scholars to come to the United States, Faust’s successor will have to advocate for the rights of international students—nearly ten thousand of whom currently attend Harvard.
“We face a very real risk that students and scholars from all corners of the globe may no longer see Harvard and other U.S. universities as attractive places to pursue their studies,” Faust told faculty members in March, shortly after President Donald Trump signed a second travel ban.
And, said Divinity School professor Davíd Carrasco, the next president will also have to focus on recruiting faculty who represent a globalizing world.
“Harvard wants to be the world’s international university and it’s not,” said Carrasco. “It’s still a regional university, and it’s good to be a regional university, but it has to be stronger in its own regions.”
Carrasco added that Faust’s successor will have to build upon Harvard’s local foundations by working with organizations like the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies, one of the oldest cultural centers on campus.
Puchner said he thinks the next president can create more initiatives to extend the University’s global reach in the humanities, especially as “globalization is not just an economic issue, but a cultural one too.”
“I think humanities has a lot to contribute with its study of the deep DNAs of different parts of the world,” Puchner said. “I hope that in Harvard’s global strategy that will play an important role.”
Reflecting on the course of her tenure, Faust said, Harvard’s “energy” for international initiatives has only grown. And at a “Worldwide Week” event in late October, she again reiterated Harvard’s commitment to global outreach in an age where isolationist rhetoric is becoming more prominent.
“Harvard’s robust commitment to internationalism is not an incidental or dispensable accessory, but integral to all that the University does in the laboratory, classroom, and in the world,” Faust said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A month after his light-hearted appearance at Harvard Law School’s Bicentennial Summit, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts ’76 was all business when he returned to the Law School Tuesday night to preside over the final round of the Ames Moot Court Competition.
The annual competition is over a century old, and for the finalists each year, it represents the culmination of a lengthy process that begins their first year of Law School. After several rounds of elimination, the remaining two teams of six students argue before a bench of three professional judges that often includes a Supreme Court justice. In addition to Roberts, Judge Debra A. Livingston of the Second Circuit Court and Judge Carl E. Stewart of the Fifth Circuit evaluated the students.
Henry J. Druschel, a third-year Law student and the captain of the winning team, said that the prospect of writing briefs and arguing before a Supreme Court Justice was “nerve-racking.”
“It certainly drives you to put the most effort that you can into this, and make sure that the product that you put out is as close to professional quality as we can do as inexperienced law students,” he said. “We’re dealing with live issues of law and so it’s all very exciting.”
Before announcing winners of the competition, Roberts urged the audience to consider the difficulty of the task the competitors had just completed.
“I’m particularly impressed that nobody seemed to be too nervous,” Roberts said. “I would’ve been more nervous if I had been in your shoes.”
Former Dean of Stanford Law School Kathleen M. Sullivan, who won the competition as a student at Harvard Law School in 1981 said that the event was as “electric” as when she competed.
“If anything I would say the students are smarter, wiser, and better prepared than we were when we were students,” Sullivan said.
David Phillips, a third-year student, won the award for best oralist for his arguments before the moot court. The teams argued a case about gender equity in the military draft process.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard says it has continued to expand graduate student housing amid pressure to increase capacity due to high Cambridge housing prices—though some residents say the House renewal project is eating up valuable real estate in the area.
Harvard currently houses over 7,000 graduate students in University-owned housing and has added more than 700 graduate student beds in recent years, according the University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
These include a series of new units built and renovated through the University’s Graduate Student Housing Initiative from 2001 to 2008.
In the most recent Cambridge City Council election, almost every candidate highlighted the need for affordable housing in their platforms.
In his profile with The Crimson, former Cambridge City Council candidate Josh Burgin said that he believes that the population of graduate students living in Cambridge is one of the main issues that needs to be addressed in order to increase affordable housing.
“A pretty big percentage of overall graduate students are living in non-Harvard housing facilities,” Burgin said. “What that’s doing in those non-Harvard housing facilities, and neighborhoods effectively, is pushing up the cost of housing because those young people are effectively amortizing the cost of their housing across multiple years of debt service.”
As of 2016, the University 0wned 391 buildings in Cambridge, 66 of which were used to house Harvard affiliates– graduate students, professors and administrators, according to a report by the Harvard Planning Office.
For many affiliates, the close proximity of University properties to the graduate schools, as well as rents that are comparable if not cheaper than housing in the surrounding area, were significant draws for applying to University-owned housing.
Siri C. Powell, a resident of Holden Green and Family Programmer for the Graduate Commons Program, said that in addition to the location of the property, her family decided to live in Harvard properties because of their family-friendliness.
“We also liked Holden Green in particular because it had a playground and a washer and dryer in the unit,” Powell wrote in an email. “And it was within a 10-minute walk to the Law School, which allows my husband to see his family more than he would have living off campus.”
The desirability of living in University-owned housing has led to some concerns about demand outpacing supply in recent years. Undergraduate House renewal has exacerbated these issues as some buildings formerly used to house graduate students have been re-purposed to house undergraduates.
In 2013, residents of two buildings on Prescott Street were forced to move out when their leases ended so that the buildings could be converted to swing housing to accommodate undergraduate House renewal. Although residents were promised top priority in the next year’s housing lottery, some worried that they would not get comparable housing to their then-current apartments.
“It’s like a competition because all the people who live here [in this building] are looking for Harvard housing,” former Prescott Street resident Alejandra Bueno said in 2013.
The University, however, argues that impact of House renewal on the housing supply in Cambridge was minimal.  In a 2016 report to the City, the University wrote that the temporary loss of graduate student housing was mitigated by a gradual increase in units from the Housing Initiative in the years leading up to House renewal.

The Undergraduate Council voted to recommend 43 new student groups for College recognition in a special session Tuesday, though some representatives voiced concerns over conflicts of interest and limited transparency during the recognition process.
The Council’s full body adopted recommendations from its Rules Committee following a 24-hour appeal period. The UC voted on Sunday to allow applicants for student groups to contest their initial recommendation for denial. Of the clubs slated for rejection, four successfully changed their status. Ultimately, the Council recommended 18 proposals for denial on Tuesday.
Now, the College’s Committee on Student Life is expected to “rubber-stamp” the Council’s recommendations at their monthly meeting on Nov. 16.
A few members of the Council said they were concerned about “conflict of interests” after some UC members with links to student organizations under consideration voiced support for their own groups during the closed-door portion of the full body’s meeting.
Winthrop House representative Henry S. Atkins ’20 said he was unsure whether representatives should be allowed to vote on the legislation if they have ties to prospective organizations.
“It would be great if we could have more clarification regarding what constitutes a conflict of interest and whether or not UC members should be voting on this,” Atkins said.
Atkins also questioned what he called a lack of external transparency in the Council’s role in the new student group recognition process, adding the UC should make future meetings of this nature open to the public.
“I think our students should be able to hold us accountable and know exactly why we approved or rejected every student group that we did,” Atkins said.
While UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said he would not want Rules Committee members with ties to organizations to deliberate on their own organizations, UC members vote on funding packages that affect groups they are affiliated with on a regular basis.
“We vote on legislation that impacts our other respective student groups all the time and I don't see this being any different,” Khansarinia said.
Evan M. Bonsall ’19, who chairs the UC Rules Committee, said members acknowledged their ties to the prospective organizations.
Bonsall said, however, that no Council members with links to student organizations were involved in formulating the Rules Committee’s recommendations, which the body ultimately adopted without amendments.
“The Council did not change any of the recommendations made by the Rules Committee,” Bonsall said. “Rules Committee was in no way shaped or formed, biased to any degree just because some members of the Council were involved with organizations.”

Following the opening of Yale’s two new residential colleges, Harvard freshmen will now be able to stay overnight for The Game under new “sister” relationships between Harvard and Yale.
The Freshman Dean’s Office sent an email to Harvard freshmen on Thursday, informing them that 80 students would be allowed to stay overnight on Nov. 17 in the common rooms of Yale’s newest residential colleges, Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin.
As of Tuesday afternoon, all 80 spots were filled, according to FDO employee Lisa R. Viola.
Relationships between Harvard upperclassmen Houses and Yale residential colleges stretch back over 80 years. This year is the 134th meeting of the Harvard Crimson and the Yale Bulldogs.
Harvard freshmen were first paired with Yale residential colleges in 2005. Previously, students were forced to rely on personal connections in order to find places to stay overnight.
These new housing options will add to a number of other Office of Student Life initiatives centered around the football game.
“There are events going on every night this week through the CEB,” Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said.
Prior to The Game on Nov. 18, students will face new, stricter tailgate and alcohol regulations. Yale will ban outside alcohol at registered tailgates and shorten the tailgates sponsored by the two schools.
The College’s OSL subsidizes the overall cost of shuttles from Cambridge to New Haven each year the game is at Yale. Students normally eligible for free tickets through an undergraduate scholarship program, known as the Student Events Fund, can ride to New Haven on a Harvard shuttle free of charge.
“The Harvard Yale Shuttle program is a service provided by Harvard College and sponsored by OSL. OSL provides financial support in order to keep the costs of the tickets affordable,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement. “HSA runs the shuttles as a service to the College, but does not make any profit from it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 1,636 fans who packed Lavietes Pavilion on Sunday afternoon certainly got their money’s worth.
In an enthralling, heart-pounding clash between the Harvard men’s basketball team and the University of Massachusetts, sophomore guard Bryce Aiken nailed a three-point dagger in the waning seconds of overtime to give the Crimson (2-0) a 70-67 victory.
That shot has since been plastered all over social media,  earning over 170 Twitter retweets and being featured on the official NCAA March Madness Twitter feed.
Aiken, already prominent around the circles of Cambridge, may have in that moment earned a bit of national recognition.
BRYCE WITH ICE IN HIS VEINS
At the preseason media day conference, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker unequivocally pronounced Aiken as the team’s best basketball player.
Despite a relatively inconsistent afternoon from the field, the Harvard point guard justified in crunch time exactly why Amaker made such a bold statement.
Aiken, who finished with a career-high 30 points and eight rebounds, was responsible for the last four points in regulation as well as eight of the Crimson’s 12 overtime points.
Going back and forth with Luwane Pipkins, the star sophomore point guard for the Minutemen (1-1), Aiken displayed his speed and versatility, breaking through the UMass defense for easy drives to the paint while showing prowess from the perimeter. A crucial step-back jumper from the left baseline with 3:47 to go in overtime allowed Harvard to jump out for a quick four-point lead, building momentum that the Crimson would extend to the end of the contest.
“Just playing together and having my teammates trust in me and me trusting them as well,”
Aiken said. “We have a lot of goals to accomplish and we are working toward that each and every day.”
Then came the three.
Holding on to a 67-64 lead with 17 seconds remaining, Harvard needed just one stop. Both teams knew the ball would be in the hands of Pipkins.
UMass’ leading scorer, who finished with 23 points on three-of-five shooting from three-point range, once again calmly sank the overtime bucket, tying the game at 67.
Amaker still had a timeout in his back pocket with eight seconds remaining. Rather than draw up a play, Amaker allowed Aiken to simply be Aiken and win the game on his own.
“We had plenty of time left to get it to him and we spaced the floor.” Amaker said, “Obviously with Bryce for us to be an amazing marksman and [that’s the] kind of the situation he loves to be in. That’s how he’s wired.”
HASKETT SOLIDIFIES HIS ROLE
Aiken’s resounding shot certainly overshadowed the performance of another critical contributor to the Crimson victory, freshman guard Rio Haskett. Despite not scoring a single bucket in the contest, Haskett displayed extreme acuity on the defensive end, particularly in guarding Pipkins.
Haskett not only tallied three critical steals late in the game, but allowed Aiken important time away from Pipkins on the defensive end. Pipkins did contribute important three-pointers in the tail end of the game, but without Haskett’s fearless play, the Minutemen certainly would have had a much easier time attacking the basket.
While still working on his shot, Haskett has solidified a role coming off the bench for Amaker. This addition will prove to be a critical one for the Crimson, especially when the 6’0” Aiken is matched with more physically-imposing point guards.
“I think it’s really big for our team, the psyche, the confidence, and certainly for our younger players,” Amaker said. “I thought we got it from a lot of different players, The balance is always big, the bench is always big, and we need to keep staying on our course.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When it comes to Ivy League football, Harvard and Penn are the proverbial measuring sticks.
Since 1997, the Crimson and the Quakers have combined to capture the Ivy League title 18 times, each claiming a share nine times apiece. Inevitably, the grudge match before The Game has division title implications. That did not change last weekend when Harvard’s Ancient Eight title hopes were dashed by Penn, a team that began the season 2-4 but has not lost since.
This year isn’t the first time that the Crimson has been downed its Pennsylvania rival. Particularly in recent years, the Quakers have been a dangerous team for the Crimson.
Harvard outmatches every single Ivy League opponent in series records since 1992 save one—Penn. In the last 26 seasons, the Crimson has been moderately consistent in beating every other team in the Ivy League, winning at least 65 percent of the time in each Ancient Eight rivalry. At it’s worst, Harvard is 17-9 against Princeton and Cornell. At best, the team outpaces Columbia 22-4.
The Quakers serve as a clear outlier to the Crimson’s Ancient Eight dominance. Against Penn since 1992, Harvard has a .346 win percentage. That means that the Crimson has won only nine of the last 26 games.
These past few seasons have proved especially brutal to Harvard, with Penn stealing wins from the Crimson at the exact wrong time.
In 2015, Harvard had not lost in 22 games. Going into the half, the Crimson led by four. A third quarter pass gave away the lead, but it wasn’t until the fourth quarter that the deal was sealed.
In front of an opposing crowd, sophomore wideout Justin Watson took a sweep and sprinted down the sideline for 79 yards and the final points of the game. In matchup, Harvard lost the game, the outright Ivy League title, and a 22-game win streak. In 2015, Penn, as well as Dartmouth, claimed the Ancient Eight title alongside Harvard.
In 2016, the story did not vary much. The Crimson sported a flawless divisional record at 5-0 and was one game away from a share of the Ivy League crown as the team went into the game against the Quakers. This time, Harvard was down four going into the half but tied it up at 14-14 with 3:23 left in the game.
Watson, now a junior, scored again to take the victory, this time through the air and with 15 seconds remaining until the whistle. Penn tacked on another touchdown as the final buzzer sounded to take the game, 27-14. Needing one victory to earn a championship ring, the Crimson missed its shot against the Quakers, and the following loss to Yale kept the team from the 2016 crown. Penn and Princeton shared the top spot for the 2016 season.
In 2017, the Quakers came back to Harvard Stadium and did nearly exactly what they had done the last time they stepped into the historic venue. On the first play from scrimmage, running back Tre Solomon took the sweep right and ran for 77 yards—only two yards less than Watson’s run in 2015.
That sprint, like Watson’s, sealed the deal, as the Crimson never broke six points even though Penn continued to build on its initial seven-point lead. With the 23-6 loss, Harvard fell out of contention for the Ivy League title. Now, the only implication for The Game is whether or not Yale will win the division title outright.
The Quakers succeed against the Crimson by halting Harvard’s offensive production. In the 2017 episode, the Crimson scored in the single digits for the first time in 80 straight games, and only the second time in 147 contests. The last team to keep Harvard below 10? Penn in 2009.
Last year’s game was similar. On the night, the Crimson netted 14 points, its second-lowest on the season. The team fought for 25 points in the 2015 loss to the Quakers, its third-lowest of the season’s 10 games.
That defensive prowess relies, in part, on the team’s affinity for hurries and sacks on the Crimson quarterback. In every one of the last three matches, Penn has outpaced Harvard in sacks. As a result, the Crimson’s pass game has suffered. This year, senior quarterback Joe Viviano dropped far less than he threw, many times forced to escape the pressure within the pocket. Viviano actually led Harvard in the rushing category on Saturday with 58 yards—not because of designed quarterback runs but because he had to run a lot.
The Quakers have always been the watermark test for the Crimson. Nine times Harvard has beaten Penn in the last 26 years. Nine times the Crimson has taken the Ivy crown in the last 26 years.

Harvardians and Yalies will be squaring off in the Yale Bowl on Saturday, but the first, and perhaps more important face-off will go down Friday night at Toad’s. Often name-dropped—either with love or disgust—by Yale students in Facebook memes, and inquired about by curious Harvard game-goers, Toad’s is the subject of Flyby’s latest ~investigation~.
Its Wikipedia description—“Toad's Place is a concert venue and nightclub”—does it little justice. From the outside, the place looks rather modest, with none of the pizazz of a major city’s nightclub. But considering New Haven puts the cut in Connecticut we didn’t expect much in the looks department. The interior looks to be just as seedy. With a small dance space, dingy trappings, and occasionally un-danceable tracks, besides their inferior taste, one might start to wonder why Yalies even bother going to this Place.
To its credit, Toad’s must be seen through a different lens. It’s a rite of passage in breaking out of the Yale bubble. “Gownies” interact with the “townies” and make memories both cringey and euphoric. Famous bands and artists have graced the stage, including Kings of Leon, Queen Latifah, and U2. Every Wednesday night is Woad’s, and the club is open only to Yale students (creating a sort of “study break” every week).
So be sure to hit up Toad’s this Friday night. If you don’t have a Yalie friend’s room to crash, you’ll probably end up squandering the wee hours into the morning here. With a shelter, plenty to drink, and close proximity to potential mates, Toad’s has your basic needs covered.
