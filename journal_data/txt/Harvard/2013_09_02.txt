After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An ivy-covered wall, scattered antique furniture, and old photographs lend a vintage atmosphere to The Harvard Shop’s new store at 65 Mt. Auburn St. The recent arrival is the third location for the student-run retailer, which also operates storefronts on JFK Street and in the Holyoke Center.
Describing the student-designed interior, the store’s Managing Director Ryley Reynolds ’15 said that she and her team “definitely wanted to make it some place you like to shop and not just some place you have to go.”
The Harvard Shop, which employs more than 100 students each year and is a subsidiary of Harvard Student Agencies, took over a former office of the STA Travel agency. The new location is the most spacious of the three and includes a basement that might play host to various pop-up businesses throughout the year.
“What’s really exciting about it is since we have a larger space, we have opportunities to carry new items,” said Reynolds.
One such item is what Reynolds described as the “‘H’ sweater.” She said the piece of clothing, which was popular around the 1960s, will be sold exclusively at the Mt. Auburn Street location.
“We reinvented the Harvard ‘H’ sweater, and we brought it back,” she said.
Reynolds noted that the Mt. Auburn Street location will also stock “year sweaters” displaying class years, like those worn by students in the early 1900s. The Vineyard Vines Harvard collection—a best seller at the JFK Street and Holyoke Center shops—will also feature prominently in the new store. She added that The Harvard Shop continues to seek new product ideas from students.
During its grand opening on Sept. 5 the new store will feature free giveaways and offer a 20 percent discount for all guests. Free refreshments from Boston’s tricycle-riding barista “The Coffee Trike” and a performance by The Harvard LowKeys will accompany the 5 p.m. ribbon cutting.
In addition to being student-run, Harvard Student Agencies is a non-profit organization, and revenue from The Harvard Shop funds wages for employed students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
D. E. Lorraine Sterritt, one of former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds’s close advisers, is leaving her position as College dean for administration, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister announced Thursday in an email to colleagues.
Sterritt will step down in mid-September, and the role of interim dean for administration will be filled by Russ Porter, the current administrative dean for science. Porter will transition into the position in early September, according to Pfister’s email.
Although the announcement did not give a reason for Sterritt’s departure, Sterritt wrote in an email Saturday that she has “decided to resign” from her position and that she plans to work on a novel she is writing while reflecting on her “next career move.”
“[T]he College is in good hands, and it’s a good time for me to think about my next move,” Sterritt wrote, praising Pfister, who took the helm of the College in mid-July following Hammonds’s departure. “I have a broad range of professional interests, from French to finance, so I’m looking forward to planning the next adventure while also taking some creative time to work on my novel.”
Sterritt’s departure concludes her second stint at the College. Sterritt first came to Harvard in 1996 and served as assistant dean of freshmen and later associate dean of freshmen. She later left Harvard to work at the University of Pennsylvania and then Stanford before returning to Harvard as dean for administration in 2010.
As dean for administration, Sterritt oversaw human resources, finance, and administration in the College, reporting directly to the Dean of the College. The position was created in 2008 to provide administrative support for Hammonds, who was incoming Dean of the College at the time.
In his email announcing Sterritt’s departure, Pfister called her a “strong advocate for the needs of the College” and cited her work launching the College Committee, which focuses on engaging staff, and leading personnel searches at the College, including the recent search for the new Dean of Student Life. Stephen Lassonde was named to that role in January and has served since he arrived from Brown in March.
Throughout much of Hammonds’s five-year tenure as Dean of the College, Sterritt was one of several members of Hammonds’s so-called Cabinet, an advising body that met twice weekly to discuss College issues. In addition, Sterritt regularly met with Hammonds separately and advised her on human resources, finance, strategic planning, and personnel structures, Sterritt wrote in an email to The Crimson in May 2012.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The class of 2017 gathered Monday afternoon to hear messages of encouragement and community imparted by some of Harvard’s most senior faculty.
Forecasted thunderstorms forced freshmen to congregate in Sanders Theater and Memorial Church to hear the fifth annual convocation ceremony, simulcasted between both venues.
The tone of the speeches simultaneously challenged students to both integrate themselves into the greater community and remain undeterred by fear of failure.
“The path to knowledge is humility,” said University President Drew G. Faust. “Be comfortable with being uncomfortable.”
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith encouraged students to pursue their goals without reservation, a message that he has emphasized in years past.
“Don’t compare; connect,” he said, reiterating that comparisons can lead to self-doubt and that connections are what set the Harvard community apart from other colleges.
Donald H. Pfister, interim dean of Harvard College, spoke of getting a D in his German class freshman fall, underscoring the importance of pursuits beyond academics. “In coming to this college, you have done more than well in school,” said Pfister. “You have joined a community.”
While the speakers were alternately broadcasted from Sanders Theater and Memorial Church, students seemed unaffected by the division of their class.
Katie W. Steele, director for freshman programming, noted that this class was particularly cohesive, especially considering students were unable to attend the visiting weekend for incoming freshmen because of the Boston Marathon bombings. Instead, they participated in a “virtual Visitas” and have been very active on the Class of 2017 Facebook group, according to Steele.
“We’ve noticed that this class really turns out for things, they seem enthusiastic about being here,” she said.
As students fanned themselves with their programs in a packed Memorial Church, some forced to stand, the Kuumba singers were projected onto a screen on the steps in front of the altar.
Erin D. Drake ’14 spoke of how one’s college career can involve a change of plans, both academically and internally. She emphasized being flexible enough to learn from experiences and take advantage of resources.
“What are you going to do with the privilege of attending Harvard College?” she posed to the audience.
The Holden Choir and the Harvard Band also performed and led the class in a jubilant rendition of “Fair Harvard,” joined by faculty and alumni. As the class of 2017 gathered indoors to unfurl their class banner, students grinned with palpable excitement.
“We bring you here to create the conditions for serendipity,” said Faust. “Don’t cling to the familiar. Let the next four years be spent learning how to fail, or at least how to be imperfect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University president Larry Summers is likely to be nominated as the next Federal Reserve chairman, a source close to the Obama administration told CNBC last week.
With the term of current chair Ben S. Bernanke ’75 drawing to a close, economic pundits and policymakers have spent the summer speculating about Obama’s choice for the next chair, a decision Obama has said he will announce in the fall. Obama’s nominee will face Senate confirmation after being vetted by the White House—a process CNBC’s source said Summers is undergoing now.
Along with the Fed’s vice chair, Janet L. Yellen, Summers is considered a top contender for the spot, though a group of Senate democrats and observers on both sides of the aisle have questioned whether Summers is right for the job, citing his controversial history of leadership and policy-making.
Summers, who served as Harvard’s president from 2001 to 2006, would not be a new face in D.C. Before his tenure as University president, the economics professor worked as Treasury Secretary in Bill Clinton’s administration and in his first term, Obama tapped Summers to lead his team of economic advisers at the National Economic Council. In addition to his teaching commitments and various advisory duties, Summers currently spearheads an economic policy project at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.
Summers’ push for financial deregulation during the Clinton administration and his ties to Wall Street have led many to doubt his judgment on issues of monetary policy as the country makes its way out of the recession.
Summers has also drawn criticism for his leadership style. As University president, Summers came under fire for comments regarding women’s aptitude for science and math as well as a public feud with African American Studies Professor Cornel R. West ’74. Amid tensions with Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Summers resigned, marking the shortest tenure for a Harvard president since the Civil War.
Nonetheless, given his history of working with Obama and reputation as a leading economic thinker, Summers seems to be a frontrunner among the pool of candidates. Obama personally defended Summers last month when news of his candidacy raised the ire of democratic leaders.
Summers has also received support for his appointment from prominent players in the finance world who tout his experience, intellect, and vision.

Apparently not everyone is doing it: 65 percent of members of the new freshman class recently surveyed by The Crimson admit to entering Harvard as a virgin. On average, respondents estimated their IQ at 128—placing them in the 96th percentile of the population. Recruited athletes reported an average composite SAT score of 2082, 173 points lower than the average score of respondents who were not recruited for a varsity sport. The much-lamented decline of the humanities is real among the Class of 2017—just 11 percent of them say they plan to concentrate in a humanities discipline.
These numbers come from an online survey of the Class of 2017 conducted by The Crimson from Aug. 5 to Aug. 28. We asked the new freshmen questions ranging about topics ranging from their career aspirations to their alcohol and drug habits, and received more than 1,300 responses.
The Crimson will reveal the full results of the survey in a four-part series that will run in print and online each day this week. Check back to learn everything you’ve been wanting to know about the newest inhabitants of the Yard.
