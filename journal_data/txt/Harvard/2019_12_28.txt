After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and scholars around the country tweeted passages from Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña’s book “The Borders of Dominicanidad” last week to recognize her scholarly work following a controversy over her tenure denial at Harvard.
The online event — dubbed “LorgiaFest” — was part of a broader effort called Ethnic Studies Rise. Founded by San Diego State University professor Raj Chetty, Emerson College professor Katerina Gonzalez Seligmann, and Columbia University digital humanities scholar Alex Gil, the initiative seeks to celebrate García Peña’s “extraordinary contributions,” according to its website.
“We hope that in engaging with Dr. García Peña, we will also recognize and honor all of those Ethnic Studies scholars who have encountered resistance and retaliation for their timely work, and to the students who need them and fight daily for epistemological insurrection, academic freedom, and justice in the US academy,” the organizers wrote on the Ethnic Studies Rise website.
The Ethnic Studies Rise initiative comes after weeks of on-campus protests of Harvard’s decision to deny García Peña tenure in late November. In open letters, rallies, and sit-ins, University affiliates have highlighted her scholarship and role as a mentor to students of color, arguing that Harvard should both reverse the tenure decision and create a formal ethnic studies program.
A protester also interrupted a December faculty meeting demanding that University administrators reverse their decision, release internal correspondence about García Peña’s case, and investigate the case for what they termed “procedural errors, prejudice, and discrimination.”
More than 200 ethnic studies scholars across the United States sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow condemning the tenure verdict last week.
Asked for comment, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven referred to Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay’s recent email on ethnic studies. In the email, Gay promised an “institutional commitment” to building an ethnic studies program and reiterated her position that FAS must hire more faculty who specialize in ethnic studies before creating a formal department to house them. She recently began a nationwide search to hire three to four faculty members who specialize in Asian American, Muslim American, and Latinx Studies.
During the LorgiaFest event, organizers invited the public to read or revisit García Peña’s book “The Borders of Dominicanidad” and tweet passages from it using the hashtag #lorgiafest.
“Lorgia García Peña explores the ways official narratives and histories have been projected onto racialized Dominican bodies as a means of sustaining the nation’s borders,” a section about the book on the Ethnic Studies Rise website reads.
Mark Ocegueda — a Dartmouth College postdoctoral fellow and California State University, Sacramento professor — wrote that he admires “The Borders of Dominicanidad” for “powerfully” addressing marginality in his LorgiaFest tweet.
“This is a discussion that informs how we can all think about historical memory, erasure, and resistance,” Ocegueda tweeted.
In collaboration with Ethnic Studies Rise, Duke University Press — which originally published “The Borders of Dominicanidad” — has made the electronic version of the book freely available until mid-January and offered a discount on the print version.
Duke University Press Executive Editor Courtney Berger said in an interview that the academic publishing company hoped to highlight the book’s “tremendous impact” on the fields of Latinx Studies, Transnational American Studies, and Caribbean Studies by increasing its accessibility for the event.
“Our hope was just really to make it more available to people so that they could read the book and understand her contribution to the field and to help facilitate the conversation that [Ethnic Studies Rise organizers] are hoping to have,” Berger said.
Ethnic Studies Rise organizers have also moderated email roundtable discussions about ethnic studies between scholars and uploaded the conversations to their website.
Activists have upheld their support of García Peña as part of a broader fight for a formalized ethnic studies program Harvard — a demand with an almost half-century-long history. García Peña helped establish the ethnic studies track in History and Literature and is currently serving on the search committee for the ongoing ethnic studies faculty search.
García Peña did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-two Harvard alumni who currently serve in the United States House of Representatives sent a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow last week declaring their support for the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers strike.
The letter — organized by Representative Andrew S. “Andy” Levin (D-Mich.) — addressed the failure of the University and members of HGSU-UAW to reach a contract after collectively bargaining for over a year. The union began its strike Dec. 3, citing three key contract provisions that the two sides have failed to agree upon during that one-year period — compensation, health care, and a third-party grievence procedures to adjudicate claims of harrassment and discrimination.
The representatives wrote in the letter that they stand in solidarity with student workers on strike, citing their “fundamental human right” to unionize and collectively bargain.
“We are pleased that Harvard has indicated its intention to honor the right for graduate employees to organize and bargain,” the letter reads. “However, if workers who organize cannot achieve a first contract expeditiously, they have rights on paper but not in their actual working lives.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton confirmed in an email that Bacow received the letter Dec. 20 and has not yet responded.
Levin, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1994, said in an interview that employers’ refusal to recognize unions, resulting in the two parties failing to reach a first contract, is “one of the biggest problems with workers’ rights in America.”
“There's really no other country where that happens,” Levin said. “You can't say a country has a system of respecting workers’ rights if, to form a union – if when they form a union – they can't even get a contract.”
The representatives also wrote that they were “concerned” that there has been “relatively little bargaining” between the University and HGSU-UAW over the course of the strike.
Since student workers first took to the picket lines, Harvard and the graduate student union have only met for one three-hour-long bargaining session. In that meeting, they reached six new contract provisions but failed to reach agreements on key issues such as compensation and health care.
“We urge Harvard and the union to negotiate much, much more intensively and to enter mediation immediately if you cannot achieve a first contract on your own,” the letter reads.
The day before Bacow received the letter, the University suggested engaging federal mediators to facilitate collective bargaining with the union. In an email to University affiliates, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 proposed using the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services to move past impasses in negotiations.
“We believe that the parties would now be best served by utilizing the services of a mediator to help us resolve remaining issues,” Garber wrote. “It is common to have a mediator help the parties move forward after exhaustive efforts at the table have fallen short.”
HGSU-UAW has agreed to mediation, and the first bargaining session with the mediator is scheduled for Jan. 7.
Levin said that when he talked to both the University and HGSU-UAW, he “didn’t see any unique issues or reasons” that explain why the two parties have not reached a contract, except for the lack of collective bargaining time.
“The truth is they just haven't spent very many hours at the table. Normally, if both sides are serious about reaching a contract, you go into you know, marathon bargaining or around-the-clock bargaining,” Levin said. “I just don't think that's happened here for whatever reason.”
“I think they need to get to it, get it done,” he added.
Levin said that though federal mediation can be helpful sometimes, it does not necessarily resolve disagreements in every case. All 22 representatives who signed the letter have co-sponsored the Protecting the Right to Organize – or PRO – Act, which attempts to expedite collective bargaining between employers and unions.
“[The PRO Act] provides for binding arbitration if parties cannot otherwise agree on a contract within four months – so that a first contract is achieved in less than six months in every case,” the letter reads.
Levin said his understanding of the HGSU-UAW strike has been enhanced by his son Saul F. Levin, a student at the Graduate School of Design who Levin said works as a teaching assistant and is a member of the union.
“I actually was on campus just earlier this week visiting him and his roommates and his friends and hearing from not just him, but other people who are in the bargaining unit about their experience of this,” Levin said. “It sort of reinforces to me the idea that this is a case where I'm confident that the parties can come to an agreement that respects the graduate employees’ rights, and they just have to put their minds to it.”
