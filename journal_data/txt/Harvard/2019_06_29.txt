After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April, Harvard got its own entry in college athletics admissions scandals as it began investigating head fencing coach Peter Brand over financial transactions involving current and former members of the fencing team. This news made me uneasy, not because of the scandal itself, but because of how little it seemed to me that the campus reacted to it. Just months before, the court case Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, challenging the College’s consideration of race in its admissions process, engulfed the start to my junior year as I worked alongside countless students to prove the importance of diversity and affirmative action. Lawsuits and scandals are not the same, but when the national conversation shifted from affirmative action to recruitment, I realized I could never imagine student athletes feeling obliged to fight for their place at this University as so many students of color have. I wondered why.
As a non-athlete, I know I’m biased. I’ll never know what it’s like to spend a lifetime training in one sport, to learn and grow through playing it, and to work as hard as I can to keep playing it in college – even as a full-time student – because I love the sport so much. Instead, I know what it’s like to be a non-athlete at a university that invests millions into its sports programs, and I feel that, in the context of numerous other meaningful student activities and organizations, Harvard overvalues athletics through disproportionately high funding and athletic recruitment.
Harvard’s athletic recruitment process is not the same as most colleges in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Like other Ivy League schools, Harvard uses an Academic Index to rigorously screen recruits’ academic skill, forgoing Letters of Intent and athletic scholarships in favor of likely letters and need-based financial aid. Harvard also makes sure that every recruit completes the normal application process, with an alumni interview and final vote by the admissions committee.
Still, the special treatment is clear. Harvard spends over $1 million on recruiting athletes, and athletes are admitted at incredibly higher rates than non-athletes with the same academic credentials. Once on campus, Harvard Athletics enjoys a $26 million budget, with particular sports like football and basketball receiving over $2 million in funding.
Why are athletics given this special treatment? To be clear, I know that athletics and student athletes have a place at Harvard. Many student athletes graduated top of their high school class, excel in some of the most challenging concentration courses, and contribute to a caring community at Harvard by volunteering with the Phillips Brooks House Association or working as a Peer Advising Fellow. At the same time though, I know dancers, musicians, scientists, writers, debaters, and activists who also spent countless hours developing their skills in high school, whose work on campus also influences and inspires countless peers, and who were admitted without the help of a formal recruitment process and whose organizations operate without the help of direct University subsidies.
To me, even though sports are valuable, they should not get special treatment.
First, college sports don’t make money and Harvard is no exception. Out of around 1000 schools in the NCAA, only about 20 schools make a profit. For Harvard, the U.S. Department of Education reports that the Athletics Department spent every dollar of its $26 million in revenues. Moreover, Harvard Athletics may actually be losing money since direct funding from Harvard may be counted as revenue — Yale’s Athletics Department has a similar budget to Harvard’s and it counts direct subsidies from the university as revenue.
Second, athletic recruitment unfairly privileges already-advantaged students. Given the sheer competition involved in Harvard admissions, most recruited athletes are still among the best students in the nation. However, The Crimson’s survey of the Class of 2022 found that when comparing recruited athletes to non-athletes, athletes were less likely to be in the top 2 percent of their high school class and more likely to live in a household earning $500,000 or more. The NCAA reported in 2018 that athletes were also more likely to be white. There’s nothing wrong with admitting students with these characteristics, and these are only relative statistics, so they do not describe the majority of recruited athletes. It simply seems unjust to be actively and systematically advantaging these already privileged students by overinvesting in athletics.
Still, even after all this, some might argue that Harvard must invest in athletic recruitment and funding varsity sports programs because athletic excellence is a part of Harvard’s identity. I have no doubt that given the centrality of sports to American culture and identity, athletic excellence strengthens Harvard’s reputation. However, justifying athletic recruitment and funding by saying that athletics are part of Harvard’s identity implies that all those other activities and organizations that it does not recruit for and does not fund are not as important, not as valuable, and not as central to Harvard’s identity. As a student, it hurts to think that Harvard values sports more than the extracurriculars that I love so much. It doesn’t just hurt though. I also earnestly believe that it’s wrong.
The professors and peers I’ve met at Harvard have taught me there are parts of our identities that should be valued, but there are also parts that should be abandoned. Harvard once defined itself as an all-male, all-white, institution, but it has learned to strive for greatness outside of that limited identity. Athletic recruitment brings many amazing students to Harvard’s campus, but that shouldn’t make special treatment for athletics an unquestionable truth. The only chance we have at growing and seeing what athletics and admissions might look like in an even better world is if we step back and evaluate which parts of our identity are worth strengthening and which parts should be grown out of. It’s time for Harvard to leave athletic recruitment and disproportionate funding behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States Patent and Trademark Office announced Monday that it would intervene in the long-standing legal contest between the Broad Institute and University of California, Berkeley over patent rights to CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells.
In its declaration of interference, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO initiated proceedings to settle priority issues between 10 patent applications filed by UC Berkeley in 2018 and 13 patents previously awarded to the Broad Institute. The USPTO also seeks to settle one of the Broad Institute’s pending applications.
CRISPR is a gene-editing technology that scientists say has revolutionary potential applications in the biomedical sphere, including helping to cure genetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis. Most of CRISPR’s potential industrial and commercial applications concern its use in higher order, eukaryotic cells.
The Broad Institute stated in a press release Tuesday that the USPTO’s previous rulings granting the patents to the Broad Institute were “properly granted” and that it welcomed the patent office’s action.
Eldora L. Ellison — the lead patent strategist on CRISPR matters for UC Berkeley — wrote in an emailed statement released Wednesday that the interference from USPTO “lays out a pathway” for resolving the dispute and will recognize that the team from UC Berkeley holds the “priority of invention.”
The interference comes after a years-long series of legal battles between the two institutions. The dispute originated in 2011 and 2012, when Jennifer A. Doudna of UC Berkeley and Emmanuelle M. Charpentier of Umeå University in Sweden were researching CRISPR-Cas9. Simultaneously, Feng Zhang ’04 of the Broad Institute was working on the same problem, albeit separately.
Though Doudna published her findings and applied for a patent before Zhang did, her work focused on CRISPR-Cas 9 in test tubes whereas Zhang’s research focused on its usage in human and mouse cells. The USPTO awarded the Broad Institute rights to use CRISPR-Cas9 for eukaryotic cell-editing methods in 2014.
In January 2016, UC Berkeley appealed the patent office’s decision, but the Broad Institute won the right to keep its patent for CRISPR in a February 2017 ruling. The patent office maintained that the patents held by the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley applied to different subjects.
UC Berkeley appealed the February 2017 decision in April of that year to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, filing six patent applications with the USPTO while awaiting a decision.
Nine days after its appeal to the federal circuit was denied on September 10, 2018, UC Berkeley filed four new patent applications with the USPTO. These applications, which claim rights to the use of CRISPR in eukaryotic cells, prompted the patent office on Monday to declare interference and prescribe another round of litigation.
“We are confident that the USPTO will ultimately recognize that the Doudna and Charpentier team hold the priority of invention specific to eukaryotic cells, as well as other settings covered by previous patents,” Ellison wrote Wednesday.
The Broad Institute stated in its Tuesday press release that the “best thing, for the entire field, is for the parties to reach a resolution.”
“It is time for all institutions to move beyond litigation and instead work together to ensure wide, open access to this transformative technology,” the Broad Institute wrote.
Edward Penhoet, special advisor to the UC Berkeley chancellor and special assistant to the president of the University of California, wrote in an emailed statement released Wednesday that UC Berkeley and “other public universities” are invaluable contributors to innovation across industries.
“We are committed to protecting the intellectual property of the groundbreaking inventions of UC faculty, like the CRISPR-Cas9 breakthrough,” Penhoet wrote.
Both the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley have licensed CRISPR-related patents to for-profit companies. After the patent office’s 2017 decision, Editas — the Broad Institute’s commercial surrogate and primary licensee of CRISPR — went up in value from $765 million to $1 billion, according to Forbes. A patent for CRISPR-Cas9 is valued at approximately $265 million.
George M. Church, a professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and a senior associate member of the Broad Institute, said Wednesday that the overall stakes of the dispute “aren’t that high.” Church, who also contributed to the development of CRISPR, is listed as a founding scientific advisor on Editas’ website.
Referring to the $265 million figure, Church said, “That’s actually quite modest, considering it’s a category, and not a particular drug.”
“This field is very rapidly changing,” Church said. “If you think about the entire genetic landscape, this is a fairly esoteric thing that's getting a little more attention than you would normally expect.”
Editas spokesperson Cristi Barnett wrote in an emailed statement Wednesday that the company remains “confident in the overall strength of our worldwide intellectual property portfolio.”
An initial conference call to discuss the interference is scheduled for August 5, according to the USPTO document.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston City Council hosted a hearing Thursday night for members of local graduate student workers — including members of Harvard’s graduate student union — to discuss their efforts to gain recognition and negotiate contracts at their respective schools.
The public hearing drew a crowd of more than 150 students and unaffiliated union advocates, some of whom gave supporting testimony. Student speakers included members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union–United Automobile Workers and students seeking union recognition from Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern University.
Boston City Councilor Lydia Edwards, who spoke to HGSU organizers in 2015 during their campaign for recognition, sponsored the hearing.
“All workers deserve protections on the job, and it’s incumbent upon institutions of higher education to realize their broader mission by ensuring economic dignity at work,” Edwards wrote in an emailed statement ahead of the hearing.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain noted in an emailed statement that Harvard is currently the only university of those represented Thursday evening to recognize and actively negotiate with its student union.
None of the four schools with students participating in the hearing sent administration representatives, instead opting to send letters to the Boston City Council. In its letter, Harvard described its negotiations with HGSU-AUW as “robust,” though it reiterated that all negotiation procedures are conducted in private.
During the hearing, Edwards said it was “unfortunate” that none of the institutions sent representatives. She added that the council might be obliged to use its “subpoena power” in the future to facilitate face-to-face conversations.
“We do have the ability to subpoena representatives from the universities to come here — and also written documents,” Edwards said after the hearing.
Boston College and Northeastern University did not respond to a request for comment. Boston University spokesperson Rachel Lapal referred to the letter the school sent to the council Thursday.
“Although we are unable to join you in person today, we are pleased to provide this written testimony about what we at Boston University are doing to support our PhD students throughout their educational and professional experiences,” the letter reads. “We believe that our PhD students are first and foremost students, whose teaching and research activities are integrally related to their scholarly and professional development.”
Some students said they were displeased that their respective universities chose not to participate in the hearing.
“It's very disappointing that the Harvard administration has not sent a representative,” said Cherrie N. Buckor, a Harvard Ph.D. student in sociology. “I was hoping that they would come and speak to the public about their stance and why they refused to grant these rights to these rights and protections that we're asking for.”
Others offered testimony on a range of issues including childcare, healthcare, mental health, wages, and recourse for discrimination, harassment, and bullying.
Alex A. Ahmed, a Ph.D. student at Northeastern University, specifically spoke about the student workers’ efforts to gain university recognition on her campus. She described Northeastern’s refusal to recognize a student-worker union as “irresponsible” and “disrespectful.”
“It's infuriating, and honestly makes me ashamed to be a student at Northeastern,” Ahmed said. “But at this point, I'm so close to graduating, and I'm proud of what I've done so far that I want to see it through. But honestly, it's shameful.”
Carleigh A. Beriont, a Harvard Ph.D. student in the study of religion, said during her testimony that Harvard failed to support her this past year as she sought childcare for her infant daughter. She added that policies designed to reduce childcare burdens for faculty could be made available to graduate students.
“The lack of institutional support for student-worker parents has a disproportionate impact on women and student-workers without access to outside wealth,” Beriont said.
Swain referred to previous statements about healthcare and childcare benefits available to graduate students.
“In addition to the coverage the majority of HGSU-UAW members already receive, at no cost, under Harvard’s student health insurance plan, the University has proposed the creation of funds totaling more than half a million dollars to assist bargaining unit members in covering the cost of dental and dependent care coverage, as well as child care,” Swain wrote in an email.
Bucknor also condemned the University for having no specific processes for addressing racial discrimination, adding that Harvard’s existing procces for resolving sexual harassment allegations “has failed student-workers.”
HGSU has proposed that Harvard institute third-party greivance procedures for racial disimination and sexual harassment in instances where it finds Harvard’s response unsatisfactory or delayed. The union has argued that because current Title IX procedures — the processes by which Harvard enforces the federal anti-discrimination law — are handled within the University, they lack objectivity.
In response to the union’s call for third-party arbitration, Swain again referred back to previous comments.
“The University is concerned that HGSU-UAW’s proposed approach would create a separate set of processes for union members compared to all other students,” he wrote. “Additionally, the University would point out that an independent arbitrator would have no legal power to issue sanctions or any form of punishment on an offending faculty, student or employee.”
“Harvard remains committed to continuing to strengthen its resources devoted to addressing and preventing harassment and discrimination, and ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all members of the Harvard community,” Swain added.
After the hearing, Edwards said she found the students’ demands “reasonable” and “fair.”
“We're not talking about making six figure salaries, we're talking about people who literally said, ‘I have no place to go if I'm sexually harassed. Allow for me to truly believe that that process is neutral, and that I have a fighting chance to defend myself,’” she said.
Harvard and HGSU have continued their negotiations — which began in October 2018 — throughout the summer, but have yet to agree on a number of contract elements.
