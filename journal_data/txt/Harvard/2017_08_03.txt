After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, Geoffrey Farmer’s Canada Pavilion at this year’s Venice Biennale seemed simply a playful installation that, with its geysers of cool water, was a pleasant break from both the gravity of the other pavilions and the oppressive heat of Venice in June. In its simplicity, however, lay a powerful commentary on the apocalypse itself, and on the inherent beauty of demise.
At this year’s Biennale, destruction was a recurrent theme. For the American pavilion, Mark Bradford piled rubble and litter up outside the door, rendering the classical architecture beat up and run down. In a critique of modern government, the Russian pavilion displayed a high-tech version of Dante’s Ninth Circle of Hell. Gal Weinstein even made mold his medium for the Israeli Pavilion, creating a fragrant display of decay that evoked destruction and nuclear war.
Thus, at first glance, the Canadian pavilion stuck out for its lack of overt reference to destruction. But its substance was not altogether unlike that of its peer pavilions. Farmer opted out of parading the human tendency for self-destruction, but he did not altogether ignore the apocalypse. Instead of focusing on destruction itself, Farmer reflected on what might be left in its wake—and his resulting vision was beautiful.
In Farmer’s piece, nature was all-consuming. The pavilion had been largely dismantled, and a giant geyser shot water like bullets into the space where the roof once was, giving the impression that the water was responsible for the pavilion’s collapse. The fallen wooden beams that littered the floor also spurted water, the life source for the plants that had sprung up in the fountain. Water dripped slowly from a human-sized praying mantis reading a book, a reference to Germaine Richier’s “La Mante, grande.” This part of the piece was accessible to those willing to take the risk of being showered by the enormous, unpredictable geyser that is the centerpiece of the installation. Water pooled in a pile of white plastic sacks and slid down a log leaning against the wall. Despite the crowds, the piece felt empty and abandoned. The image is of a world reclaimed by nature, of life rising from rubble.
In his image of possible future destruction, Farmer made reference to past destruction as well. He made reference to countless incidents of war and accident. In fact, Farmer went so far as to incorporate physical artifacts of destruction, such as pieces of the ruins from the fire of Peter Pitseolak High School in Cape Dorset, Nunavut and a water trough that stood in an open field in Switzerland throughout the Second World War.  Under Farmer’s hand, the tangible products of disasters became pieces of something beautiful and serene.
Farmer took a step back from the other pavilions’ fear of the apocalypse. He reminds us that what humanity is afraid of is its own end, not the end of everything. The idea that our demise could in fact yield something beautiful—though we would not be there to see it—is one that, under normal circumstances, is incredibly difficult to grasp. In front of the dripping and splashing Canadian pavilion, it becomes easy.
In his description of his own piece, Farmer described a push to have the Canadian sign removed from the front of the pavilion. Though the country’s sign did indeed remain, Farmer hardly failed in his goal for universality. In fact, from toddlers splashing around in the water to elderly women staring upwards from under the brims of their sun hats, it seemed impossible for visitors to look at Farmer’s exhibition without smiling. With the simple beauty of glistening water—a medium fitting for the floating city of Venice—Farmer managed to elicit in the viewer a joyous, childlike wonder that seems a world apart from the rest of the Biennale.
Somehow, Farmer has made apocalypse alluring.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We talk a lot about female objectification in the media—how women are constantly sexualized, objectified, and used as nothing more than aesthetically pleasing and sexually arousing props in advertisements, music videos, and movies. The dehumanizing effects of this imagery have been well-documented, with extensive research demonstrating that objectification leads to depression, anxiety, body shame, sexual dysfunction, and eating disorders among women.
Objectification of women’s bodies, however, is nothing new. Throughout history, much of visual art has been about appreciating female beauty and the female form. Less than 4 percent of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 76 percent of the nudes are female. From the Venus de Milo to the Mona Lisa, women are overwhelmingly the objects, not the subjects, of art. Imagery is catered to the male gaze. Women are not meant to do the looking; they are meant to be looked at.
But when I was watching Charli XCX’s self-directed music video for her latest song “Boys,” I felt something distinctly unfamiliar stir within me. As I watched Connor Franta seductively brush his lips with his thumb and Brendon Urie gaze sensually at me as he lay among rose petals, I realized that this piece of art was specifically designed for me, a heterosexual woman.
As I watched the music video, I thought about the discomfort that my straight male friends might feel. I thought about how they might feel uncomfortable seeing other men in such a sexualized and romanticized light, with Joe Jonas licking his lips while staring deeply into the camera and Khalid laughing as he cuddled with puppies, and how they might feel insecure about their own bodies after seeing Cameron Dallas’s god-like abs and Jay Park’s chiseled cheekbones.
And I realized that this is how I feel all the time. Whenever I’m watching music videos or glancing at advertisements, I get the uncomfortable feeling that this material was not made with me in mind. I feel slightly uneasy and insecure, as a straight woman, seeing other women constantly portrayed in such a sexualized and romanticized light, with long-eyelashed Victoria’s Secret models throwing “come hither” glances at the camera and beautiful naked women used as voiceless props in music videos.
This subversion of the male gaze was exactly Charli XCX’s intention. She explained that she wanted the boys in the music video to be “doing all the sexy things that girls usually do in music videos” and, in this way, “flip the male gaze on its head."
And it worked. Straight women everywhere swooned and reveled at the abundance of sexy boys in the music video, leaving enthusiastic comments about their favorite ones and how their smiles “melt my heart” and how “I almost passed out” and how “I died when I saw Brendon.”
The “Boys” music video did more than bring joy to millions of women around the world; it also busted the myths that women don’t have sexual feelings of their own, that women don’t crave sex the same way men do, that women aren’t as visually stimulated as men are. All of that is false. Numerous studies have shown, over and over again, that women want sex just as much as men do, and women actually might be more turned on by visual images than men.
But the myth that women have low sexual libidos persists, in large part, because the people in charge of directing, casting, and producing visual content are overwhelmingly male, and have no idea how much women crave sex, and how much pleasure and enjoyment we get from seeing a man’s body. In producing this wildly successful music video, Charli XCX showed the world that women have just as much sexual agency and desire as men do.
The problem with objectification in the media isn’t necessarily that women’s bodies are put on display or that women’s beauty is being appreciated, but rather that representations of beauty and sexuality are so consistently one-sided. Everyone likes looking at pretty people. Sex is titillating. But visual content in the world is overwhelming tailored for the viewing pleasure of straight men, making the rest of the world feel like our desires don’t matter or don’t even exist. By failing to produce content with other audiences in mind, we end up marginalizing and erasing the vibrant spectrum of sexualities that exist in the world.
So the solution to the issue of objectification, or at least one part of a possible solution, appears to be simple. We need more content. We need content that celebrates beauty as it manifests itself in men, women, transgender people, and nonbinary people. We need content that caters to gay people, bisexual people, pansexual people, and straight people. We need content that captures the vast diversity of sexualities, sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions.
It’s no longer good enough to create content with only straight men in mind, which only affirms the validity of straight male sexuality. It’s about time that content reflects the rest of us, too.
Until then, I’ll be dreaming about boys.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will investigate allegations that Harvard discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process, according to a department spokesperson.
The New York Times reported Tuesday that the Trump administration intended to up the Justice Department’s efforts to target universities whose admissions policies it deemed discriminatory against white applicants, citing an internal department document obtained by the Times. The document sought to recruit lawyers for the new project, according to the Times.
But on Wednesday, a Justice Department spokesperson said the department's investigation would be more narrowly tailored, focusing on a single complaint filed in 2015 accusing Harvard in particular of discriminating against Asian Americans in its undergraduate admissions processes.
“The posting sought volunteers to investigate one administrative complaint filed by a coalition of 64 Asian-American associations in May 2015 that the prior Administration left unresolved,” Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement Wednesday evening. “This Department of Justice has not received or issued any directive, memorandum, initiative, or policy related to university admissions in general,” the statement continues.
The Department of Education dismissed the complaint against Harvard, brought by the Asian American Coalition for Education, in 2015, citing an ongoing lawsuit brought by a separate group against the University alleging similar discrimination.
That lawsuit, spearheaded by anti-affirmative action provocateur Edward Blum and filed in November 2014, alleges that Harvard employs illegal racial quotas in its admissions processes. The lawsuit is currently in the discovery process.
Harvard has repeatedly and emphatically denied allegations that it uses racial quotas in its admissions process.
"To become leaders in our diverse society, students must have the ability to work with people from different backgrounds, life experiences and perspectives. Harvard remains committed to enrolling diverse classes of students,” Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane said. “Harvard’s admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the U.S. Supreme Court.”
The Class of 2021 is 22.2 percent Asian-American, a record high for the University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty-eight freshmen will live in DeWolfe—a building not typically designated for first-year housing—this academic year after an unusually large number of freshmen enrolled into the class of 2021.
Last May, Harvard announced that a record-high 84 percent of admitted students in the Class of 2021 chose to matriculate to the College for the coming fall—the highest yield rate since 1969.
While the University has credited expanded financial aid, academic offerings, and cross-campus resources for enticing more students to attend Harvard, this “unusually high” yield sent administrators searching the campus for more rooms to house the larger than anticipated freshman class, according to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
“Our search for extra beds resulted in the creation of a new entryway for freshmen, using traditional undergraduate housing stock in DeWolfe,” Dingman wrote in an email to DeWolfe freshman residents.
Indeed, four first-year students will share a DeWolfe apartment, each of which contains two double bedrooms, an in-suite bathroom, a common room, and a kitchen. The 28 freshman residents in DeWolfe will be a full-fledged entryway, affiliated with Elm Yard, with two proctors and three Peer Advising Fellows.
To deal with this year’s exceptionally high yield, administrators weighed several options. While they were able to increase the capacity of a few dorms in Harvard Yard, ultimately, the high numbers required them to look elsewhere.
“For 28 students,we determined that we needed to find some other place. And DeWolfe was the most appropriate other place that we could find that was both in close proximity to the Yard, still on campus, and where we felt that students would not be isolated,” Elm Yard Resident Dean Jasmine M. Waddell said.
The coming academic year will be an anomaly, however, and the Freshman Dean’s Office does not plan to use DeWolfe as first-year housing in the future. Waddell said DeWolfe housing was a “creative solution to an extraordinary problem.”
In Dingman’s welcome email to DeWolfe residents, he praised some of the dorm’s special benefits such as air-conditioned suites—a rarity in Harvard’s freshman dormitories.
“You will have the same access to resources as all freshmen, but will have the unique advantage of being able to eat breakfast in Quincy House or Leverett House should you choose,” he wrote.
Traditionally, all freshmen live in one of the 13 Harvard Yard dorms, Apley Court, or in either of the three Union dormitories—Greenough, Hurlbut, and Pennypacker Halls. The expansion of first-year accommodations beyond the existing freshmen dormitories is unusual, though not entirely unprecedented. In 1992, renovations to Weld Hall forced the use of 29 Garden St. as freshman housing.
The College leases 10 and 20 DeWolfe St., two former apartment buildings, from Harvard University Housing for “overflow housing” to accommodate additional upperclassmen. The over $1 billion House Renewal project to modernize the upperclassmen residences, however, plans to phase out the DeWolfe St. units and allow all undergraduates to live in their affiliated Houses.
Dingman added that the DeWolfe freshmen will have the “same transition to upperclass housing” as the rest of their class. His note seemed to echo complaints raised by the 166 residents who lived at 29 Garden St. in 1992, who demanded that they receive special priority in the sophomore housing lottery.
This time, twenty-five years on, Dingman told this year’s incoming DeWolfe residents, “You will have a similar living experience as the rest of the class.”

Anthony Scaramucci is out of his role at the White House faster than you can say, “Is this on the record?”
In light of such an abrupt staffing change, Flyby has compiled a list of three things longer than Scaramucci’s 10-day tenure as White House Communications Director.
1) The lifespan of those fruit flies in your dorm room (40 to 50 days)
So you went away for the weekend and accidentally left some fruit out in your dorm room. The resulting fruit flies have a long life ahead of them—long compared to Scaramucci’s time at the White House, that is. Props to you for making the effort to eat healthy, though.
2) A pre-college program at Harvard (two weeks)
A session of Harvard Summer School’s pre-college program is two weeks long, meaning that high school summer students are spending more time at Harvard than Scaramucci spent working at the White House. Unlike the camaraderie of summer school friendships, it doesn’t look like Scaramucci will be keeping in touch all that much with his new (old?) White House pals.
3) Scaramucci’s death (as listed in the Harvard Law School alumni directory)
The most recent edition of the Harvard Law School alumni directory mistakenly lists Anthony Scaramucci, a 1989 graduate of the Law School, as deceased. The first update in over five years, the edition sent to alumni last week lists an asterisk next to Scaramucci’s to indicate his death between 2011 and 2017. RIP Mooch.
