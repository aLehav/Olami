“La loi du marché” literally means “the rule of the market,” but the film’s English title is “The Measure of a Man.” These two phrases put together summarize the plot perfectly: it depicts the conflict between an ordinary man who wants to make a decent living and support his family, and the cruel law of the market that corners him into giving up his dignity and sympathy. The film’s highly polished screenplay and great sense of understatement explore this question to its extreme.
At the film’s beginning, the audience is introduced to the main character, Thierry, played by Vincent Lindon, and his problem: he does not have a job. He argues with a receptionist about a professional course he has just taken on construction machinery, which has proven useless in the job market. The receptionist insists that they have designed the course to meet the needs of the market and claims it is Thierry’s mistake for choosing this course without any previous experience in machinery.
This is an argument that is all too familiar in daily life. It could take place in a bank or government office; people worn out by endless trivialities argue over and over without reaching any result. Director Stéphane Brizé doesn’t over-dramatize the argument; he just presents the scene as it is, and at some points it almost feels like watching the monitor of a CCTV. In the first half of the film, the main character is constantly tortured by the cruelty of reality. Viewers see him do an interview on Skype, where he lowers his expectations over and over only to be told that he had a slim chance to get the job in the first place; they then see him speaking to a bank clerk, who walks through different types of investment plans and finally suggests that he sell his house; they even see a consultant at an insurance company recommend that he buy life insurance because it “makes you feel safe if you suddenly die.” All of these meaningless conversations are so unromantic and exhausting that the reality of Thierry’s life becomes suffocating.
In the second half of the film, Thierry finally gets a job as a security guard at a supermarket but his situation still does not improve. Responsible for preventing shoplifting, he has to deal with ordinary people just like himself who have to resort to theft when they have no job. At several points, the shoplifters that he apprehends explain their plight to him and other security guards, but in the instances, all that Thierry can do is remain silent and follow procedure. There is a great sense of helplessness in the inactivity of Lindon that is more touching than any dramatic breakdown.
“La loi du marché” is a precise, direct, and profound depiction of the current European economic crisis, and it has great power in its understatement and extremely relatable story. It is almost ironic that it was shown at Cannes, where right outside the theater is a street full of sports cars and luxurious clubs.

In perhaps one of the most provocative opening scenes in cinema history, “O Piseu” (English “Office”) begins with hardworking family man Kim Byung-Guk (Bae Seong-Woo) bludgeoning to death his mother, wife, and young son with a hammer. This horrific and bloody scene sets the stage for the rest of the film, a tense thriller in which homicide detective Choi Jong-Hoon (Park Sung-woong) searches for the still at-large Kim. He discovers that Kim, who was disliked and marginalized by his colleagues, was only close to an intern named Lee Mi-Rye (Ko A-Sung), who seems to be hiding an important secret. Further adding to the case’s intrigue, Kim was recorded on a security camera entering the office’s parking garage following his gruesome crime, but no footage displays him leaving.
Director Hong Won-Chan makes a masterful feature film debut with “O Piseu,”; he uses traditional horror techniques such as tight framing to magnificently build tension and manipulate the film’s atmosphere. At certain points in the film, the line between reality and hallucinations becomes blurred, and it is unclear whether the fugitive Kim is actually lurking behind every corner. The office’s cubicles are transformed into a horrifying maze of blind spots, especially after work hours when the lights are dimmed and solitary characters are working overtime. Bae’s dead-faced performance as Kim complements the film’s intensity, as he captures with alarming accuracy the demeanor of a sociopathic killer.
The film’s latter half gradually shifts focus to Lee, who is similarly shunned and mocked in the workplace despite her dedicated work ethic. Ko does a fantastic job portraying this neurotic character, especially her gradual descent into madness as a result of her professional failings. However, Choi Yun-Jin’s script still renders her an unsympathetic protagonist—it is hard to care for a shy, self-pitying character who makes no concerted effort to better her own situation.
Hong transforms this thriller into a full-blown slasher flick by the film’s final part, and with no suspect to be found, one wonders if certain characters are facing karmic retribution for their overzealous professional competitiveness. The film makes an interesting critique of the formality of Korean society, and its bloody denouement comes off as a direct denouncement of the workplace rat race. The office is a literal prison, and the film seems to argue that those beholden to it ultimately lose more than just their sanity—if they do not leave in time.

Filled with mesmerizing visual sequences, director Joachim Trier’s “Louder Than Bombs” is a captivating though at times disjointed narrative exploring the nature of grief. Three years after the suicide of their mother, famous photojournalist Isabelle Reed (Isabelle Huppert), husband Gene (Gabriel Byrne) and two sons Jonah (Jesse Eisenberg) and Conrad (Devin Druid) still struggle to move on. As they try to understand the mother they barely knew, they are forced to confront the reality of their own personal failings.
Although the screenplay (from Trier and co-writer Eskil Vogt) occasionally meanders in transitions between each of the three men’s narratives, Trier more than compensates with a surfeit of beautiful montages, assisted by cinematographer Jakob Ihre. Memory is often intermingled with fantasy in juxtaposition to present-day reality, and scenes featuring the deceased Isabelle possess a lulling, dream-like quality. Another one of the film’s most memorable sequences features voiceover narration by Conrad set to a kaleidoscopic array of visuals.

Explicit symbolism of confinement is rampant throughout "Dheepan," a brooding drama about a former Sri Lankan Tamil Tiger seeking political asylum in France. Accompanied by a false wife and daughter, the titular Dheepan (Antonythasan Jesuthasan) is trapped serving as the caretaker for a run-down housing complex until he gains citizenship. The dark, narrow corridors of the apartment buildings are an ironic setting of imprisonment for the former freedom fighter—indeed, Dheepan's only place of refuge is not the cramped ground-floor apartment he shares with his faux-family but a dimly lit utility room in the basement where he can drink and smoke in peace. Even the neighborhood's drug-running thugs feel stifled, as one gang leader says bitterly to Dheepan's wife—under house arrest and restrained by a security anklet, he is morbidly aware that he will likely end up dead, just like his father and uncle before him. Director Jacques Audiard makes skillful use of lighting throughout the film and in certain shots encapsulates characters in a suffocating darkness. His regular utilization of fade outs in between scenes further contributes to the film's foreboding, contemplative mood. In a performance that aptly captures his character's military background, Jesuthasan exudes a deliberate, toned-down blankness that only hints at the tumultuous emotion underneath. Although he is an outsider to this squalid, crime-ridden French suburb, Dheepan is captivated by a newfound desire to recreate a family to replace the one he lost during the war—and instead of having to illegally hawk two euro trinkets on the streets of Paris, now even a part time job in this neighborhood pays the unthinkably high sum of 500 Euros. It's this dream of freedom that propels Dheepan to extraordinary lengths to protect his wife and daughter, even if they themselves aren't entirely convinced by the charade. He is forced to take decisive action when a visit from a former war comrade brings the violence of his past into his new life, and things are further complicated when escalating tension between the neighborhood gangs threatens his much sought-after stability. The script, from Audiard and co-writers Noé Debré and Thomas Bidegain, does an excellent job of slowly unraveling Dheepan's tough shell throughout this turmoil to expose a genuinely caring family man.
The action scenes are mostly limited to the third act, and Audiard executes them with extreme delicacy—the film, after all, is a slow-burn exploration of Dheepan's attempted post-war redemption. The few moments of violence in the film are appropriately tense and as jarring to watch as they are to the characters experiencing them. Dheepan's wife occasionally speaks of escaping to England away from this barbarism—to a promised land, so to speak—but by the film's end, it's unclear whether such paradise is deserved and truly within reach or merely the stuff of their fantasies.
