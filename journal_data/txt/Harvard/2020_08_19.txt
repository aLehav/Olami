After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A tractor-trailer fatally struck a male bicyclist in Harvard Square Tuesday morning, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
The accident took place near the Out of Town News kiosk on Massachusetts Ave., Warnick confirmed in an email.
“Unfortunately, the bicyclist (a man believed to be in his 50s or 60s) died as a result of the crash. The operator of the tractor-trailer remained on-scene and is cooperating with investigators. The tractor-trailer was traveling westbound towards Johnston Gate,” Warnick wrote.
Warnick added that CPD officers remained on scene conducting an investigation as of 1:15 p.m.
This is the second fatal accident in Harvard Square in less than a year. In September 2019, 67-year-old librarian Sharon Hamer was struck and killed by a truck when crossing outside of the crosswalk.
The Middlesex District Attorney’s Office is investigating Tuesday’s accident.
Tuesday’s events reignited a debate on social media over pedestrian safety in the Square that began after Hamer’s death.
On Twitter, Cambridge Bicycle Safety, a group of Cambridge residents organizing for bicyclist safety in the city, called for the establishment of a protected bike lane in the Square.
“After Sharon Hamer was killed here a year ago, the Harvard Square Kiosk project was changed to remove a travel lane and make space for a protected bike lane. This protected bike lane needs to happen now. No more delays,” the group wrote.Cambridge City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler shared photos of the accident site on Twitter.
“This is less than a year after a pedestrian was killed by a boom truck just yards away. This needs to change,” Sibronho-Wheeler wrote.
Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote in a statement Tuesday that the design of the Square should be changed to make the area safer for pedestrians and cyclists.
“Anyone who has been in Harvard Square can tell you it’s almost always full of pedestrians and cyclists crossing irregular intersections that were designed before motor vehicles existed. We need to rethink and pedestrianize these streets to make sure this does not keep happening," Sobrinho-Wheeler wrote. "And we need to figure out what Cambridge can do to limit trucks like these from travelling at 9am through crowded pedestrian areas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Researchers at Harvard’s Wyss Institute are developing a vaccine structure that could more effectively combat COVID-19 and other viruses.
Originating from cancer vaccine research led by Harvard Bioengineering professor David J. Mooney, the vaccine technology — OMNIVAX — provides a new approach to stimulating and strengthening the immune system against infectious diseases such as E. coli.
OMNIVAX employs a unique design and material that allows for the combination of different antigens – foreign substances found in viruses that initially stimulate the immune system – and adjuvants, substances which prolong the immune system’s response to antigens.
“We call it OMNIVAX because we're able to put in antigens very simply – in general, we're able to just add them to our solution,” said Edward J. Doherty, a Wyss lead staff scientist on the project. “We don't have to do any chemistry, we don't have to build them, we don't have to conjugate them because of the nature of this mesoporous silica material that we use. It absorbs most of these components quite readily, and it has massive surface area.”
Though it was not invented to address the novel coronavirus pandemic, Doherty said he and other researchers have redirected the application of OMNIVAX in recent months to focus on COVID-19.
“When COVID came around in April, Harvard labs shut down except for folks working on COVID,” Doherty said. “So then we mounted a project against COVID and we began incorporating COVID antigens, protein antigens, into our vaccine system and vaccinating animals.”
OMNIVAX’s structure forces the immune system’s response to be more efficient by forcing dendritic cells – cells that make the immune system aware of present antigens – to regularly interact with specific antigens, according to Doherty.
Initial test results in mice have been promising, showing increases in production of antibodies against COVID-19. Additionally, blood from vaccinated animals has shown that OMNIVAX could prevent the infection of cultured cells by a COVID-19 pseudovirus.
But more OMNIVAX tests on animals at risk of COVID-19 are still necessary, Doherty said.
“We're doing primarily rodent studies,” he said. “Rodent studies are non-challenged animals, so these animals do not have COVID. The next step we would do is animals that then are challenged. So these are very specific standardized models that we'd have, that we are getting involved with.”
Doherty also said his team hopes to eventually create a company that works on combating a wide range of disease with OMNIVAX.
For now, however, the team’s focus will remain trained on COVID-19.
“COVID, in all honesty, is a very interesting and challenging place to work, because there are numerous vaccines that are already in Phase Two and Three human trials,” Doherty said. “We then have to think very carefully about attributes and whether or not we can develop an attribute that these others don't seem to be demonstrating – responsiveness to safety duration – then it might be something worth pursuing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the September Massachusetts state primary and the November presidential election approach, Cambridge officials say they are working to address residents' concerns about the security and safety of voting amid the pandemic and growing controversies surrounding the United States Postal Service.
Last week, the Postal Service sent letters to 46 states, including Massachusetts, warning it cannot guarantee that all mail-in ballots for the November election will be delivered in time to be counted. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy issued a statement Tuesday announcing the Postal Service is prepared to “handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall” and will suspend any planned cutbacks to the mail service until after the November election is concluded.
As concerns regarding the security and speed of the U.S. Postal Service mount — complicated by health and safety worries related to the coronavirus pandemic — officials in Cambridge have taken extra steps to ensure every vote is counted.
Cambridge City Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler said the pandemic had already impacted the typical plan for voting, noting that the city’s Election Commission has enacted measures to move polling places from “high-risk locations.”
“The pandemic has definitely affected voting and how we think about it considerably and not wanting to have long lines of people and enclosed spaces to potentially transmit COVID,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
Cambridge Vice-Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said the City has taken several measures to address residents' concerns about both the pandemic and the reliability of the Postal Service, including offering a dropbox for those who wish to submit their ballots without having to mail them. Mallon said there is a dropbox located at 51 Inman Street and staffed by a poll worker from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., in addition to dropboxes at all of the City's early voting locations.
“Both our city leadership and our public health department and our election commission really feel that during the pandemic, voting by mail is the safest way to reduce transmission, while at the same time exercising your right to vote,” she said. “For the September 1 primary we have created a dropbox for residents if they don't want to mail in their ballots.”
Mallon also said the City has ordered five outdoor dropboxes for the general election in November.
Some Cambridge residents took to social media to warn their neighborhoods about the potential delays with mail-in ballots.
One resident, Loren Crowe, wrote on Twitter that it took his ballot six days to go two miles across the city by mail. He urged residents who are planning to mail in their ballots to allow themselves a week for shipping or drop off their ballots in person.
Mallon said residents can drop off their ballots without coming into contact with other people at three early voting locations — the Moses Youth Center, the Cambridge Water Department, and the Valente Library — starting August 22 through August 28.
“If you have your ballot, you can go into any of those three [early voting] locations and pop your ballot right into the box,” Mallon said. “You don't even have to really be in there very long if you feel uncomfortable being indoors around other people.”
“We're really, really taking this seriously — not only making sure that everyone's ballots are counted but that we're keeping our residents safe from COVID-19 during the pandemic,” she added.
Sobrinho-Wheeler said he will likely submit his vote at one of the dropbox locations.
“I submitted my ballot application myself more than two weeks ago now and still haven't gotten my ballot,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said. “When I get it, I think I'm gonna fill it out and take it to the dropbox, because I don't trust that if I put it in the mail that it will get there in time for September 1.”
Other residents said they are not as concerned. Robert Winters, a mathematics instructor at the Harvard Extension School and MIT and editor of a blog on Cambridge politics, said in an interview that he is not particularly worried about mail-in ballots in Cambridge.
“I don't have any particular concerns about the mail-in balloting,” he said. “I may have concerns about that in other states — swing states, for example — but in Massachusetts, it's not a great concern to me.”
“For anybody who wants to vote by mail but has concerns about the post office, they have a couple of great options,” he added, referencing the dropbox locations and early voting option.
Mallon said it is important to ensure every vote gets counted for the upcoming elections, this year in particular.
“It's the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which afforded some women the right to vote,” Mallon said. “These rights have been hard fought by many members of our communities, whether they're women, whether they're members of our Black community or indigenous people community.”
“We need to ensure that everyone has the right to vote this November and September,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s annual Board of Overseers and Harvard Alumni Association director elections concluded Tuesday evening after being pushed back two months due to COVID-19.
The 2020 Harvard elections kicked off July 1 after the University postponed its start due to the global coronavirus pandemic. It was originally scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19.
The Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — advises Harvard administrators and approves certain actions taken by the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association serve as representatives for alumni across Harvard’s schools.
In late October, Harvard Forward launched an unprecedented campaign to get its slate of five candidates onto the ballot. Harvard Forward is a campaign advocating for climate change reform and young alumni representation on the University’s governance boards.
To make it onto the ballot each of the five candidates was required to gain roughly 3,000 alumni signatures to petition to join the ballot. Harvard Forward promoted their slate of candidates and policy proposals through town halls held around the world, office hours, and social media.
The Harvard Alumni Association’s Nominating Committee did not nominate any of Harvard Forward’s proposed candidates, but all of the campaign’s five candidates received over 4,500 signatures and made it on the ballot in February.
Then, the coronavirus pandemic hit and forced the election to move online. By the end of the 10-month campaign, Harvard Forward — adept at online events and outreach — spent about $59,000 in pre-election and election expenditures.
In an emailed statement, Harvard Forward representatives wrote that they are “proud” to have run a “positive, grassroots campaign.”
“We're really grateful for the thousands of alumni who came together to take a stand for climate justice and inclusive governance,” they wrote. “We've heard from so many alumni who say they've never voted before, but this year they felt inspired to vote for Harvard Forward.”
Harvard Forward representatives wrote that no matter how the election turns out “alumni have made it clear that these are issues Harvard must address.”
This year’s election also focused on issues of racial justice as the Coalition for Diverse Harvard, an activist group that supports increased diversity at the University, endorsed candidates after a process of research, diversity questionnaire, and interviews with the Overseers candidates. The Coalition was formed in 2016 in response to a controversial alumni group’s ticket for the Board of Overseers.
Kristin R. Penner, who is a board member for the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the Coalition’s candidates lead on racial justice issues and advocate for an Ethnic Studies program at the University.
“Whatever the results, Diverse Harvard, alumni of color organizations, and progressive alumni groups are not going anywhere,” Penner added.
All Harvard degree holders — except those in University instruction and governance positions and members of the Harvard Corporation — were eligible to vote in the elections by traditional paper ballot or online in the Board of Overseers election. All Harvard degree holders were eligible to vote for Harvard Alumni Association elected directors.
The election results will be announced in the coming days in the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.

Shopping week usually instills a sense of chaos reminding us that school is back, and there’s no reason that can’t be true this year. During this pandemic, we’re all craving a sense of normalcy. Use this guide to help continue your shopping week traditions from years past.
Forget to choose your classes
Let’s be honest — we all say that we will pick out our classes during the break, but it will never happen. While you can’t recreate running to a class you just found out is necessary for your concentration, you can run to your computer frantically when you realize that your Zoom was supposed to start 15 minutes ago.
Shop even more classes than usual
Shopping week is always filled with more classes than anyone should rationally try to attend. And now that you don’t even have commute time, why not add more classes on to your packed schedule? We all missed the stress.
Get in contact with old friends
At this time during the pre-COVID era, we would be making plans to “grab a meal” with people we haven’t seen in the past few months. Even in a socially distanced semester, you can still make those plans to catch up with friends. And hey, you probably still have the same chance of actually following through and getting a meal with any of those people.
Back to School Party at Home
Shopping week is traditionally the time to celebrate being back in your favorite place, Harvard Square. While we may not be back, we can celebrate having something to do other than use sourdough starters. Call up your friends on Zoom and get your favorite beverage (legally allowed in your current place of residence).
Cheers to making this shopping experience as chaotic as it usually is!
Sections
Ah yes, shopping week. Here we are again for the never-ending chaos of popping in and out of classes, dreaming of getting into too many lotteried courses, and frantically searching for that last gem we need to complete our schedules. Now, add the bonus challenge of it being entirely online! Especially with many professors holding vague info sessions and office hours, it’s time to brush up on those ~social skills~ so you can really get all the tea you’ll need on their classes (and even more importantly, make sure that they do actually care about you!).
If they taught a class last semester: “How did you adapt your course for the new virtual circumstances?” 
Let’s be real — the second half of last semester was a bit of a dumpster fire for all of us, professors included. It’s important to have some patience with your professors, since they were likely adapting to this new situation as well, but it’s also good to know whether they were understanding with students during such a big period of adjustment. Did they adapt assignments? Were they flexible with class attendance? Were they more understanding with grading? If they answer “no” to all of these, it might be the time to go check out another class. Your future self will probably thank you!
If you’re international or in a distant time zone: “What are your plans for keeping asynchronous students connected to the course material and staff?”
Straight off the bat, make sure to check out the class’s Canvas site to see if it actually allows asynchronous students (after all, you don’t want to get stuck taking PSY 1015: Psychology of Sleep at 3:00 a.m.). Once you’ve confirmed that you can actually enroll in the class, now’s the time to see if the professor is going the extra mile to make sure you can stay engaged with the course. Maybe they’re creating study groups within each student’s time zone, making a Slack channel with students and TFs, or offering extra flexibility for group projects — no one wants to be teaching themselves right now, and plans like these can make sure you don’t have to.
If the course is capped: “Is the enrollment process conducted through a lottery, an application, or some other process? Are there certain priorities by grade or concentration?”
Their Canvas site may not be fully updated quite yet, so this is a great question to ask before you get your hopes up on that class that seems way too good to be true. Knowing what the enrollment process will be like can help give you an idea of your chances for actually taking that class with a 15-person cap, especially if you’re a freshman or are trying to branch out to classes outside your concentration. Don’t forget to put those deadlines in your calendar (and, worse comes to worst, be ready to beg via Zoom for a spot in the class)!
If you just need a vibe check... “What’s your Hogwarts House?/What’s your star sign?/What kind of bender from Avatar are you?”
Shopping week is basically a week-long vibe check, but it can be a bit harder to get a feel for what a professor is ~really~ like over a Zoom call. Why not get straight to the point with some of these questions? Even better: Try sending over your favorite Buzzfeed quizzes in the chat and check out their results. After all, do you really want to take a class with a professor who doesn’t know what Disney character they are based on their favorite breakfast foods?
While this Shopping week may look different, it’s still a great chance to check out some new courses, meet professors, and hopefully find those next Zoom crushes to pin on your screen during class. Online office hours might be a bit intimidating at first — especially if you’re just looking to learn more about a professor’s teaching style or see who else will be taking the class — but this can also be a great opportunity to ask whatever questions you have without the pressure of 100 other people in the lecture hall listening to you too.
