After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 27, 2022, at 12:01 a.m.
Harvard Institute of Politics Director Mark D. Gearan ’78 is set to step down after serving more than four years in the role.
Gearan, who held a variety of roles in the Clinton administration, will return to serve a second stint as president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Gearan steered the IOP through a tumultuous period marked by high staff turnover and the departure of Caroline B. Kennedy ’80 — the last living child of President John F. Kennedy ’40, to whom the IOP is dedicated — who resigned from its senior advisory committee in 2020.
Setti D. Warren, the IOP’s current executive director, will serve as its interim director while the Harvard Kennedy School conducts a search for the 20th director. HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf first announced the news of Gearan's departure in an email to school affiliates on Tuesday.
“Under Mark Gearan’s leadership during the past four years, the Institute of Politics has been both an integral part of Harvard Kennedy School and one of the largest student organizations for undergraduates at Harvard College,” Elmendorf wrote. “I admire Mark’s dedication to helping Harvard students become the public leaders and public servants we need, and these students and all of us who have worked with Mark have benefited from his hard and skilled work.”
Gearan joined the IOP as its 19th director in March 2018 after serving 18 years as president of Hobart and William Smith. He served as director of the Peace Corps under the Clinton administration from 1995 to 1999.
Gearan oversaw the IOP through the Covid-19 pandemic, during which it was forced to transition its operations to remote.
William D. “Bill” Delahunt, a former U.S. representative and a member of the IOP’s SAC, said Gearan “performed admirably” while guiding the Institute through the pandemic.
“Under difficult circumstances, I think he demonstrated leadership, understanding, and a deep and genuine affection for the IOP,” he said.
Gearan said his departure from the IOP was “a hard decision, but one that has been made through the lens of what I did for 18 years and my sense that this was the right next chapter.”
According to Gearan, he will depart the IOP Aug. 15 at which point Warren will take over as interim director.
Gearan said Warren is “​​a seasoned administrator and public servant.”
“It’s very appropriate and very nice for me to know that the Institute is in such able hands with Setti,” Gearan added.
Gearan said that from the start of his tenure at Harvard he hoped to improve the IOP’s internship program and provide it with more funds.
“If you get students with an opportunity in public service or journalism or activism — that can be very defining,” he said. “So expanding the number of internships, increasing the stipend of internships, securing some additional resources for it — all those things I think are important and I’m proud of what’s happened here in four years.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email that Gearan “leads with his head and heart,” and lauded Gearan for his stint as faculty dean in Winthrop House during the 2019-2020 academic year.
“Mark Gearan is one of the finest higher education leaders in the nation,” Khurana wrote. “Among his numerous talents is his ability to bring people of different perspectives and voices together to solve challenging problems.”
Tabitha L. Escalante ’23, who serves as vice president of the IOP, said Gearan has been “an incredible leader.”
Gearan has tried to “ensure that everything that we’re doing is not just sitting in a room and hearing about politics from practitioners who have done it,” Escalante said. “But making sure that everybody that leaves any study group or any forum that we’re having with a good sense of how they can move forward from here and take action on the issues that they care about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand and Harvard College parent Jie “Jack” Zhao will go on trial in December on charges they allegedly conspired to secure admission to Harvard for Zhao’s two sons with bribes totaling $1.5 million.
Brand, whom the University dismissed in 2019 for violating Harvard’s conflict of interest policy, was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2020. The December 5 trial date, announced earlier this month, will come more than two years after Brand and Zhao were first arrested on bribery charges in November 2020.
A grand jury returned a revised indictment against Brand and Zhao in June 2021, with the added charge of conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud, alleging that the two devised a bribery scheme with the intent to “deprive Harvard of its right to the honest and faithful services of its employee” through interstate communications.
The honest services charge was central to several of the unrelated Operation Varsity Blues admissions bribery cases. Actress Felicity Huffman, among the most prominent defendants charged in that investigation, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit honest services mail fraud in 2019.
Kevin J. O’Brien ’74, a partner at the law firm Ford O’Brien Landy, said the recent college admissions trials have centered around two types of fraud: defrauding a university of an admissions slot, which attorneys have argued is valuable property, and depriving it of an employee’s “honest and faithful services,” as in the Harvard case.
“You expect — and you’re paying for — a coach to exercise his or her best judgment in admitting recruits and granting scholarships,” O’Brien said.
Brand’s attorneys did not respond to requests for comment.
Attorneys representing Brand and Zhao disputed the additional charge and jointly moved to dismiss it in January, arguing that even if the allegations were true, the conduct described would not constitute fraud against Harvard.
“The Superseding Indictment does not allege that Harvard was deprived of money, nor could it, because the Zhaos paid full tuition,” the defense attorneys wrote. “And it does not allege that Harvard was deprived of admission slots reserved for qualified student-athletes, nor could it, because the Zhaos were eminently qualified for admission to Harvard as fencing recruits.”
Judge George A. O’Toole denied the defense’s motion to dismiss the fraud charge on July 7.
The indictment references a text message Brand allegedly sent to the founder of a fencing academy that Zhao’s sons attended as one of several “overt acts” committed to advance a bribery scheme between Brand and Zhao.
“Jack doesn’t need to take me anywhere and his boys don’t have to be great fencers,” Brand allegedly texted. “All I need is a good incentive to recruit them[.] You can tell him that[.]”
Though the fencing academy founder was referred to only as “Co-Conspirator 1” in court documents, he was previously identified by the Boston Globe as Alexandre Ryjik, who started the Virginia Academy of Fencing in 1991.
Zhao’s defense team declined to comment.
The text message and other communications that the government says constitute wire fraud were first revealed in a November affidavit from an Internal Revenue Service special agent who investigated Brand, Zhao, and others in connection with the case.
The government alleged that Zhao donated $1 million intended for Brand to a fencing charity founded by Co-Conspirator 1, and also paid for Brand’s car, mortgage, home renovations, and part of Brand’s son’s college tuition. Zhao also allegedly purchased Brand’s Needham, Mass., home for significantly above its market value through his company, iTalk Global Communications, Inc. The purchase raised suspicion from the city assessor and triggered an independent review which ultimately resulted in Brand’s dismissal.
According to the indictment, both of Zhao’s sons received likely letters — early positive indicators of admission for prospective students — from Harvard, which the government alleges were facilitated by Brand’s recruitment of them to the fencing team. Brand allegedly failed to disclose any of the payments he received from Zhao to Harvard when he recruited Zhao’s sons, who have both since graduated from the College.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment.
The scandal was first brought to light by the Globe in 2019.
O’Brien said that prosecutors in the Brand trial would likely avoid some issues that were present in many of the Varsity Blues cases — namely, that none of the alleged bribe money was paid to Harvard, instead going to Brand directly or through associated charities. According to O’Brien, this would make it difficult for the defense to claim that Harvard was not harmed by the alleged bribery.
“You can’t argue that they were the beneficiaries of the scheme instead of the victims,” O’Brien said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not long after the annual Major League Baseball Draft concluded last Tuesday, July 19th, two Harvard baseball players received life-changing calls.
The Washington Nationals sought out recently graduated right hand pitcher (RHP) Jaren Zinn ’22, while the New York Yankees rang incoming senior RHP Adam Stone ’23. Both signed to their respective organizations as post-draft free agents.
In 2020, Major League Baseball shortened the amateur draft to only five rounds rather than its usual 40, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In the two seasons since, they’ve expanded it to 20 (not including compensation rounds), The 20 is still a stark contrast to the previous 40 and cuts the number of prospects drafted nearly in half. Therefore, the undrafted free agent pool included many talented collegiate and high school players, including Zinn and Stone.
Jaren Zinn
A dual outfielder and pitcher in his high school and prior baseball career, Zinn was a raw prospect with a strong arm when he arrived at Harvard for his freshman year in the fall of 2018. Working with the coaching staff, the Chevy Chase, Md. native refocused his priorities to a full-time pitching role.
His freshman year was riddled with injuries, as he arrived on campus with a stress fracture of the navicular bone in his right foot. Ultimately, his season was cut short on March 15th after the second of his two pitching appearances, a loss to Furman in which he allowed a run and two walks while recording one strikeout in an inning of work.
“I felt like I could never stay fully healthy,” he said.
Sophomore year proved to be another challenge, a dual battle with pitch control and repeated minor injuries of his back and shoulder. Although Zinn continued to develop both accuracy and velocity, he did not see the field. Instead, he established himself as an imperative team personality that helped the Crimson clinch the Ivy League title and reach the NCAA tournament.
When Zinn reached junior year, it all started to click.
“Junior fall in our inner squads and practices is when guys on the team and our coaching staff kind of started to see like, ‘Okay, we might have something here – there's some potential,’” Zinn said. “For the first time [I knew] I was gonna pitch.”
He was a strong reliever out of the bullpen, and in his second appearance, against Fairfield on March 6th, had a 1-2-3 inning that served as a point of confidence.
“It was so exciting,” he said. “Now I can kinda really start playing–It was like I got my feet in and I'm ready to roll.”
However, just four days later, the Harvard administration notified students that they had to evacuate campus due to Covid-19.
Frustrated at losing his 2020 season, Zinn consequently took an academic gap year in order to prevent the loss of his senior season in 2021. During the beginning of the pandemic, Zinn converted his basement into a full gym, borrowing pieces of equipment from his high school trainer, and pitched every day in his backyard.
“I think it was a huge benefit in terms of sort of keeping me sane because we didn't know when this [Covid-19] was gonna end,” he said. “I mean, obviously everyone who went through Covid knows it was like a time of uncertainty and anxiety.”
He spent the fall semester just off campus in Allston with teammates Jack Mahala ’22, Buddy Mwroka ’21, and Tommy Seidl ’21; having temporarily shed the time commitments that come with being enrolled in classes, Zinn was able to make baseball his full-time job. He commuted to Cressey Sports Performance in Hudson, Ma, a facility owned and run by New York Yankees Director of Player Health and Performance Eric Cressey and frequented by Major League players such as Corey Kluber and Aaron Civale.
The year off allowed Zinn to continue to develop and strive to his pitching goals. When he left campus, Zinn was barely touching 90s; his gap year allowed him to make the jump to comfortably sit at mid to low 90s, touching 95-96 mph per pitch. During his gap year, he also scrimmaged with other collegiate players that were also taking time off, and Major League scouts would come to watch their self-produced scrimmages. Between the former and his participation in the New England Collegiate Baseball League for the Bristol (Conn.) Blues, Zinn started to catch attention.
When he returned to campus, rather than return to his typical role in the bullpen, Zinn was told he would be the third member of the Crimson’s rotation: the Sunday starter. He took his promotion in stride- claiming, “It was pretty good except for two nightmarish outings.”
In 11 games, he posted a 7.50 ERA, 3-3 record and was named Ivy League Pitcher of the Week on March 14th, after a six-inning, one run, 11 strikeout outing against Cal Poly two days prior. Zinn’s season’s best performance came against Harvard’s Ivy League archrival Yale on May 15th, pitching a full six innings and striking out eight in the last game of his collegiate career.
“I gave up a couple of runs early and then just stayed out there – I basically lobbied with our coaches to let me stay there until I was at 120 pitches and then got the win,” Zinn said. “It was a great way to go out. Cool way to ride into the sunset.”
In the time between the end of the season and that fateful phone call from Washington, Zinn kept training.
“I've worked so hard for this and the worst possible scenario would be to get a chance when I've just been like messing around for two months,” he said. “[I decided] I'm gonna keep throwing bullpens once, twice a week [and] basic hitters lifting every day. Now, I'm so glad I did that. If not, I would just be kind of in a panic mode, if I didn't feel prepared, but I feel so great.”
He flew down to the Nationals’ development facilities in West Palm Beach, Fl over last weekend. After officially signing on Tuesday, Zinn will participate in mini-camp with the Nats’ other new prospects, taking on the mindset he did during his gap year,treating baseball as if it were his full-time job –except this time, it actually is.
Adam Stone
As soon as it became apparent that Stone was talented enough to play Division I baseball, he focused on committing to one school and one school only. He wanted to follow his two older brothers, Kevin ’20 and Grant ’19, in playing at Harvard for head coach Bill Decker.
Like Zinn, the 6’6” righty also entered collegiate baseball injured, yet he was in the final stages of recovery. About a year prior to enrolling in college, Stone received Tommy John surgery, repairing his torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right arm, injured from overuse. Expected recovery from Tommy John ranges from one to two full years and typically marks the end of baseball careers for young pitchers and professional players alike.
Stone intentionally had his surgery prior to his senior year of high school, as it was his goal to return in time for his first collegiate season to share the field with his brother Kevin during his senior season. In doing so, Adam sacrificed his own high school senior season at Fairfield Prep.
“My freshman year consisted of a bunch of time in the training room and trying to get my elbow right,” Stone said. “Then we got sent home [due to Covid-19] right before I was gonna get back on the mound.” He was slated to pitch the weekend of March 15th before the Ivy League canceled the remainder of the season.
Like Zinn, baseball became a safe space for Stone during the pandemic – something he knew and trusted, his peace in a time of chaos. He spent the first spring and summer of quarantine at home training, having the benefit and experience of training with his brothers.
Unlike Zinn, however, Stone decided to enroll for the 2020 fall semester. He had the option to be on campus, which he gladly took.
“I went to campus with 12 other guys because I thought it was important to work with the coaches a little more and make sure that I was a familiar face and they knew my background and how I pitched,” Stone said. Working with Harvard’s staff helped him adjust to working with his new arm and further make up ground he lost due to Tommy John. “I thought honestly, that was a good time for me to develop and have some more one-on-one time with the coaches.”
He continued the momentum into his junior year, and his performance during fall ball and preseason made Stone the Crimson’s no doubt Saturday starter. He posted a 5.34 ERA with a 2-3 record, one save and 33 strikeouts over 10 games and 32 innings. His strongest performance was at Rice on March 3rd, where he went five innings, striking out eight and recording no earned runs.
Going into the MLB draft, Stone didn’t know what to expect; knowing it was a possibility of getting drafted, he was nervous, but was also calmed by the increased potential of signing post-draft, knowing that clubs would still be looking for new prospects due to the limited number of drafts.
The New York Yankees gave Stone a call late in the third day of the draft, offering him a post-draft free-agent contract. He took a day to contemplate, having the additional consideration that he has one more academic year before completing his degree. When it came down to it, he decided to follow his dream.
“[It] was just an opportunity that I couldn't pass up,” Stone said. “Professional baseball has been something that I've always wanted to do.”
The Stamford, Ct. native confidently inked his contract and headed down to Tampa, Fl where he will also participate in a mini-camp with fellow Yankee prospects.
Although he grew up a fan of the Yankees’ famed rival, the Boston Red Sox, Stone could not be more ecstatic to have the opportunity to join such a distinguished organization.
“I'm super excited to be around a bunch of great baseball minds that have been in professional baseball for so long and I'm just looking forward to them helping me tap into all this potential that I know I've had for so long,” Stone said.
Both Zinn and Stone will surely leave lasting marks on Harvard baseball and serve as encouragement and inspiration to their previous teammates that also have Major League ambitions.
“Coach Decker was great and still believed in me the whole way,” Zinn reflected. “And our team has a really unbelievable culture, which I think improved pretty much every year the time I was there…It's a pretty special group.”
“I'm super thankful for the coaches and the program and my experience was awesome,” Stone concurred. “I wouldn't change it.”
