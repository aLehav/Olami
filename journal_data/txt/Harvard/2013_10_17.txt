After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Tuesday marked the end of Hispanic Heritage month, and as of that day “Instructions Not Included,” the Spanish-language film starring, written, and directed by Eugenio Derbez, has grossed almost $43 million, making history at the U.S. box office. The movie (released as “No Se Aceptan Devoluciones” in Spanish-speaking countries) is a comedy-drama about an Acapulco playboy turned devoted father, and it is currently the top-grossing Spanish-language film released in North America, edging out “Pan’s Labyrinth.”

Derbez conceived of the movie more than a decade ago after seeing the Italian comedy-drama “Life Is Beautiful,” and set out to create his own heartwarming story of a father and child. The movie’s production consumed 12 years and $5.5 million (more than twice the normal budget of a Mexican film), not to mention Derbez’s own versatile talent as a director and actor. During that same time he continued to develop his following through the television series “XHDRBZ” and “La Familia P. Luche” in Mexico as well as recent collaborations with Adam Sandler (in 2011’s “Jack and Jill”) and Rob Schneider (in his sitcom “Rob”). 
The movie has a broad appeal, with salacious humor for the teenagers, messy tangles of love for the adults, and slapstick for kids. This amounts to a movie that’s fun for the whole family. In a recent article from NBC Latino, Roberto Orci, the Mexican-American film/TV writer (2009’s “Star Trek,” “Sleepy Hollow”) and CEO of Acento Advertising, describes how Latinos tend to account for a disproportionately large percentage of ticket sales: “We’re exposed to the marketing and our culture is very family-oriented, which makes activities like eating out and going to the movies very typical.” 
That said, the idle spectator might still find this film incongruent with its peer group of high-grossing foreign flicks, which includes “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” (2000) and “Amélie” (2001). What this movie lacks in “wuxia”-style action or visually-rich, imaginative storytelling, it replaces with telenovela-style plot inversions and a generous dose of physical comedy.  
Even though the movie appears goofy and straightforward, it has many relevant messages about bilingualism and biculturalism. Derbez’s language games tend to jump off the screen and make viewers cognizant of those on either side of the armrest; when Valentín points out that his daughter Maggie seems to be named after a salsa, those familiar with the brand laugh, but those who aren’t may feel too young or uncultured to get the reference. 
These realities, combined with Derbez’s star power, account for most ingredients of the winning recipe. In a 2006 New York Times article, Anthony Kaufman discusses some of the challenges of entering the domestic market from abroad, including the fact that talented foreign directors quickly transition “to films that rely on American stars and are made for American tastes.” With Latinos currently accounting for 1 in 4 ticket sales in the U.S., and with that number rising, to continue distinguishing between “American taste”and the “Latino sensibility” might soon be counterproductive.
Sometimes a movie will come along and surprise with its success—demanding attention and a reevaluation of what makes a hit film. Instructions not included; returns not accepted.

It was 1924, and the art historian Langdon Warner was face to face with a work of breathtaking proportions. The adventurer who would later help inspire Indiana Jones couldn't take his eyes off of the Tang dynasty murals painted upon the walls of the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, China. They were so dazzling that “there was nothing to do but to gasp,” he later wrote in his book “The Long Old Road in China.”
But Warner would do more than just admire the painted caves. After making the appropriate arrangements to remove some of the murals in an effort to preserve them, he used a special chemical solution to peel the frescoes from the cave walls. But to his horror, the solution froze before the removal process was complete, damaging the frescoes and leaving marks on the site itself.
With a dozen murals in tow, Warner returned to Cambridge, Mass., where he had graduated from Harvard College in 1903 and now taught Chinese art. Today, nearly 90 years later, the murals remain in the collection of the Harvard Art Museums, and until the closure of the Fogg in 2008 for renovation, they had never been taken off exhibition to the public.
But back in China, Warner's acquistion caused outrage. The murals he removed are still considered stolen goods in China, and Warner is viewed by some as a thief—plaques in the museum at Dunhuang even designate him as such.
Warner's acquisitions raise questions about the way prominent museums currently acquire, hold, and display art. These questions are no less relevant for Harvard's museums, whose collections contain pieces from across the globe and throughout history. Such diverse holdings make it necessary to ethically determine who has custody over works of art and negotiate the point at which an item transcends being a piece of art and becomes an exploited piece of culture.
Although the murals have temporarily removed from display, there is no plan to send the wall paintings back to Dunhuang any time soon despite the controversy surrounding them, according to Melissa A. Moy, associate curator of Chinese art at the Harvard Art Museums.
Moy says the issue is much more complicated than some make it out to be. “It [was] such a different time, and it's hard to look back at it really with a 21st-century lens and really have that full understanding of everything,” Moy says. “I can say in my years here there have been one or two letters that we have received from people who visited Dunhuang who are outraged by the fact that Harvard has these things and are demanding them back. But all we can do is try to explain the circumstances and explain that Dunhuang themselves have not asked for it back.”
The fact that Dunhuang museum officials have not requested the return of these murals even further complicates the argument that they should be returned. “If there is a legitimately contested object that one could prove was stolen, then of course we would proceed in taking the steps to return it to its rightful owner,” Moy says. However, she does not believe this to be the case with the Dunhuang murals.
“I tend to want to think of it like, ‘Well, there were good intentions,’” she says. “[Warner] went about asking for permission. He actually paid for some of these things… and it was sort of accepted at that time because there wasn't a national widespread appreciation for the caves yet. And he was seeing a lot of natural damage and man-made damage that was happening.” Now that they are at Harvard Art Museums, Moy says, these pieces are well protected and preserved.
However, while these murals were technically bought, the Chinese view the purchase in a much harsher light. Daniel N. T. Yue '16, a Crimson design executive, got a view very different from Moy's during his 2013 trip to China. “[In Dunhuang] there's not much debate. It's pretty clear that it's theft to them and that [the mural] should be returned,” Yue says.
Moy understands the some of such outrage. “I think what makes it hard is that one can see the obvious scars of the work he did [in Dunhuang].” Stark white gaps in the colorful Dunhuang wall paintings serve as a continued reminder of  Warner's removals, which some view as an example of looting by imperialist powers.
Though Moy does not condone Warner's methods for removal, she believes that the purpose of his mission has been unfairly demonized, regardless of the damage it caused. “It was really an effort to try and promote the study of a very glorious art tradition that wasn't well understood yet,” she says. “It was kind of ironically a preservation act.”

In an attempt to prevent further controversies like the one surrounding the Tang Dynasty murals, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) met in 1970 in Paris. Their mission was to discuss the “the interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural and educational purposes increases the knowledge of the civilization of Man,” according to UNESCO's official website. At this conference, UNESCO enacted the laws by which international museums must currently abide. On the Harvard Art Museums' collecting policy page, the guidelines state that the museum will not acquire any piece that may have been illegally taken after Nov. 17, 1970, in accordance with the UNESCO agreement.
However, while these agreements are certainly very beneficial in regulating the trade of art all items imported after Nov. 17, 1970, it leaves a lot of controversial art unaccounted for. In the case of the Tang Dynasty murals as well as multiple other pieces of cultural property removed in the 20th century and before, the UNESCO protocols do not necessarily have an effect.
Even with policies like the UNESCO agreement in place, there are still other issues that museums must consider when dealing with the accession or the repatriation of pieces. Primary among these is protecting the piece from harm. “Any antiquity that is, say, buried in the ground and gets dug up is removed from a stable environment into an unstable environment,” says Joseph A. Greene, deputy director and curator at the Semitic Museum.
Moving pieces once they are in a museum is also risky, as is the case with the murals from the Mogao Caves. “They are very fragile, and it was a very experimental process that [Warner] tried to remove those things,” Moy says. The chemicals Warner used, along with the nature of the murals, have made even considering the return or even the loan of them impossible.
However, Moy says that she does want to collaborate with Dunhuang scholars, noting that in 2009-10, the Harvard Yenching Institute sponsored a researcher from the Dunhuang Research Academy, who studied the Tang Dynasty frescoes. “They recognize that we have them here,” Moy says.  “And there is a certain acknowledgement that this is not something that anyone here would ever do today, but it was a different world back then.”
Another concern often raised when discussing repatriation is the fitness of the source country's institutions. Some scholars view increased international collaboration as a solution to the issue. Theresa E. Sims, a Ph.D. student in art history at Harvard, brings up the example of the Benin Bronzes, a collection of hundreds of ornately figured metal plaques taken from Nigeria in a 1897 punitive expedition by the British. Though the British Museum has sold some of these works back to Nigeria, they have kept the bulk of their collection despite calls for repatriation.
“[One] argument that [has] been made about the Benin Bronzes and other pieces of artwork that are in Western institutions is that Nigeria doesn't have the resources to take care of them properly as they should, and the British Museum sees itself as this custodian of world culture,” Sims says.
But the British Museum is not the only institution to possess these bronzes—a 2012 donation of Western African art made to the Museum of Fine Arts included a number of works stripped from the royal palace of the Kingdom of Benin during the 1897 invasion. The Peabody holds some of these bronze plaques in its collection as well.
Moving forward, Sims would like there to be a greater effort to improve foreign art facilities. “I would be interested in seeing more of an interest on the part of Western museums in ways that they can collaborate with institutions of the continent [of Africa] so that it's not just like a black-and-white, ‘Well, we have the resources, so we're just going to keep the art because these African institutions just can't handle it.’”
Whether a museum holds a bill of sale or believes itself to be serving as protectors, there might still be some moral implications to consider in the display of some pieces. The displaying of African masks, for example, presents a much deeper ethical issue than a legal question of who technically owns the piece. “There's a lot of scholarly debate about the problem associated with taking something like a mask out of its original context and putting it into a museum. Especially because masquerades generally do have a more spiritual significance,” Sims says.
The displaying of masks in museums as merely pieces of art or culture poses potential problems within the source societies at large, even if one member of the society was willing to sell or donate the mask. At Harvard, the Peabody Museum has a collection of such masks, many of which were purchased by George Harley. “Their sale to him was something that was very fraught,” Sims says. “He had to buy them from people in secret because it was a real taboo within the community to sell these things.”
These masks are not currently on display at the Peabody Museum for space reasons; however, Sims asserts that museums should take this latter reason into consideration more. “With particular types of masks that are customarily not meant to be seen outside of a ritual context or that or that have those kinds of attributes attached to them, I would be more wary about displaying that in a museum.”
In 1990, the United States passed the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, disallowing the display of certain Native American cultural items and requiring all institutions receiving government funding to return items that were classified as human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or cultural patrimony.
“The [Peabody] Museum has repatriated in all of those [NAGPRA] categories,” says Patricia Capone, curator and repatriation coordinator at the Peabody. According to Capone, the museum has returned hundreds of items. “The law dictates what is returned and what isn't… Harvard has given a great deal of support to implementation, and the university is in compliance with the act,” Capone says. “As a university museum, we try to be as well informed as we can.”
In 2001, the Peabody Museum repatriated a totem pole to Cape Fox in southeast Alaska. This pole had been taken from an empty Tlingit village in Cape Fox in 1899. A year before the totem pole was returned, the museum was given a red cedar trunk and commissioned Nathan Jackson, a traditional Tlingit artist, to craft a totem pole out of it. Now this newly constructed totem pole, named Kaats' and Brown Bear Totem Pole, stands in the Peabody, replacing the original totem pole that resides again in Cape Fox. To the museum, the totem pole is a representation of an ongoing friendship between the Peabody and the Tlingit people.
But while NAGPRA has resulted in the return of the totem pole and other cultural items that scholars may declare unethical to display, it may not be enough.
“There is no global convention that parallels NAGPRA in terms of the display, control of, and repatriation of these kinds of items,” Greene says. The UNESCO agreement addresses only illegally exported items, not items of cultural sensitivity. But, Greene adds, “Individual countries might in fact adopt these kinds of procedures. There's a particular sensitivity to the display of mummies and mummy remains in Egypt. Museums that actually have mummified remains that have displayed them have actually drawn back from that, I think in deference to Egyptian sensibilities.”
In time, an agreement similar to NAGPRA may be proposed to define an international code for ethical possession and display. But at the moment, no such law is in place, and museum directors and curators are left to make their best judgment calls.
But the obligation to return objects to their places of origin must also be weighed against the positive aspects of the museum environment.  “I think that the purpose of an art museum is to allow people encounters with objects that are informed by the scholarship that happens in a museum,” says Sarah Kianovsky, curator of the collection in the division of modern and contemporary art at the Harvard Art Museums.  “Rather than encountering an object without any context or without information, visitors to a museum get to take advantage of the accumulated scholarship of centuries of art historians and museum curators.” Balancing this with the duty to respect the communities from which these pieces are acquired is an ongoing challenge for curators.
“We have the responsibility to care for [our pieces] and make sure they don't suffer any further damage and that we maintain them and preserve them and teach with them and make them available the best that we can,” Moy says. “So I can only say [this]confidently about my institution, but I know that we do a good job of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly two weeks ago, President Drew G. Faust addressed a letter to the Harvard community in which she rejected the idea of divesting the University’s money from the fossil fuel industry, an idea which has garnered much attention and support over the last year.
The widespread growth of the on-campus divestment movement is due to the work of Divest Harvard, a student and alumni activist group that advocates the University’s divestment from fossil fuels. The group has clearly gained the president’s attention enough to solicit the letter, but she remains staunch in ignoring their cries for cleaner University investments. Faust’s stubbornness on the issue is truly inexcusable—continued carbon pollution is reckless and harmful to the planet and all who occupy it. Her letter should do little to sway anyone who understands the real danger of climate change.
“Harvard is an academic institution,” Faust wrote, and no doubt all would agree with her. However, when you are in charge of $32.7 billon, you take on responsibility for how that money is spent. Reaffirming what is already known, that Harvard is a university and is dedicated to academics, does not in any way eliminate that responsibility. When Harvard invests in fossil fuels, it invests in harming the future of human existence through continued carbon pollution in the atmosphere. That is a fact. Just this last week, the scientific journal Nature published a study concluding that, within 35 years, average annual temperatures will consistently exceed current record highs. Across the country, leaders in various industries are already preparing for the impending changes in climate. These changes present a real, imminent threat, and the president of Harvard ought to treat them as such.
In her letter, Faust boasts of Harvard’s teaching and research in environmental studies in an attempt to minimize her noxious investments. However, in doing so she heralds some of the biggest proponents of divestment—students and professors—in her defense of current investment strategies. The thriving environmental education programs at Harvard contain many who advocate divestment, as do the other schools that constitute the University, including the Business School and the Kennedy School. But while President Faust might cite her dedicated faculty and student body, she isn’t listening to them. She’s listening to Harvard’s money management.
She expresses this sentiment in her letter’s opening: “I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise." This is where Faust is most honest with her readers. She admits whose side she’s on, who she’s working with. She isn’t ultimately listening to the compelling scientific case, nor is she listening to University outcry over fossil fuel investments. No, instead Drew Faust is listening to her colleagues on the Corporation, whose financial stability rests more comfortably in support of the fossil fuel industry than it does in the welfare of mankind.
I’m not expecting any public miracles from Faust. It makes perfect sense that the University’s financial caretakers wish to do exactly that—take care of its finances. But let it not seem as if there were any moral greyness about this decision; the right thing to do here is in no way unclear. Divestment can’t just be treated like an optional policy consideration, one that can be shelved if found undesirable. Divestment from an industry as wretched and toxic as is that of fossil fuels is an eventual must, if not now then in the near future. It is beyond safe to say that humans have polluted their planet to the point of dangerous global climate change, and to remain financially invested in the production of such danger is morally indefensible—no matter what Faust’s colleagues on the Corporation say.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s that time of year again—the one in which a third of campus dresses to the nines, puts on its best networking faces, and always seems as though it has more important people to whom it should be speaking. While this may sound like the beginning of final club punch, it actually marks the transition to “recruiting season,” the hypercompetitive process in which Harvard juniors and seniors scuffle between on-campus interviews with their dream employers in the fields of consulting and finance. Or at least that’s what any outside observer must think simply by viewing the urgency with which some of the school’s most dedicated students devote themselves to landing some of America’s most lucrative entry-level positions.
Obviously, the notion that so many students arrive at this liberal arts college with a passion for finance or consulting is a dubious one. But this does not stop a full 39 percent of the senior class from participating in the On-Campus Interview Program offered by Harvard’s Office of Career Services. When the implications of the current job market are taken into consideration in tandem with the exigencies held by holders of liberal arts degrees, it is not difficult to understand why recruiting is so popular among those facing imminent graduation. Money, status, and the potential for attractive future opportunities are all strong reasons to participate in the program, and Harvard’s complete lack of any pre-professional finance curriculum enables students from all academic disciplines to participate on a relatively level playing field. And it certainly helps that, during recruiting season, prospective employers come here, providing Harvard students with the privilege to limit the geographic scope of their job hunt to their own backyard.
We applaud OCS for its success at linking students to these specific career opportunities. The primary concern of most upperclassmen here is securing employment post-graduation, and it is impressive that 18 to 22 percent of the student body manage to consistently land jobs in consulting and finance.
Every student undoubtedly knows too many classmates who succumb to what OCS Director Robin Mount terms the “lemming effect,” in which students feel compelled to join the recruiting program because of outside pressure—either social or institutional in nature. While it is a shame to think that students may pursue career opportunities in which they are truly not interested, culpability in this regard ultimately lies with students themselves on not with OCS.
OCS’s efforts are admirable. The office works diligently to present students with a wide array of opportunities in a diverse sampling of fields that appeal to a broad range of interests.  In attempting to combat the potential for institutional pressure to go into finance or consulting, OCS cautions visitors to its website that “Although students often report that it feels like ‘everyone’ is using OCI to find their job or internship, that is not statistically the case.” Somewhat ironically, some students have even complained that OCS deemphasizes finance and consulting recruiting in favor of alternative programming. We wholeheartedly disagree and believe the office has taken significant steps toward fostering the mindset that—despite the inescapability of friends in suits—there are plenty of options. We implore OCS to keep up the good work.

The tragedies of our world—mass shootings, terrorist attacks, war—dominate the daily news and leave a sense of bleakness. But more quietly, recent events in global health policy provide a reason for optimism.
Several countries recently announced historic pledges to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria for its next three-year funding cycle, 2014 through 2016. France has pledged $1.4 billion, the Nordic countries have collectively pledged $750 million, and the U.K. has pledged $1.6 billion.
The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is the main multilateral funder in global health. It successfully channels 82 percent of the financing to fight TB, 50 percent of financing to combat malaria, and 21 percent of financing for HIV/AIDS. The goal of the Global Fund is to get all three of these deadly diseases under control, removing them as threats to public health. It’s an ambitious goal, but also an attainable one.
Take HIV, for example: When HIV-infected individuals are treated with antiretroviral therapy, the risk of transmitting the virus to an uninfected person decreases by 96 percent. In other words, treatment is prevention. What about TB? When TB screening and treatment are available, TB is much less likely to develop drug resistance. We can currently treat a case of TB with drugs that cost about $30, but it costs 100 times as much to treat a case of multi-drug-resistant TB.
The Global Fund has been a model of effective foreign assistance. Recipient countries develop their own proposals, an independent review panel evaluates them, and all results are tracked and published publically. With Global Fund assistance, countries have doubled the number of people on HIV treatment over the past five years to nearly 10 million. They have also doubled the number of cases of TB that have been detected and treated, reaching 11 million people. Over 340 million insecticide-treated bed nets have been distributed and 330 million cases of malaria have been treated, helping cut deaths due to malaria in Africa by one-third over the past decade.
We are at a historical tipping point in fighting these three diseases, but the gains are fragile. If we take our foot off the gas now, we can easily lose the window of opportunity.
Every three years, donors meet to make a three-year financial pledge to the Global Fund. The U.S. just announced that it would serve as the host of the Fourth Replenishment conference on December 3, 2013. This is a very welcome sign of support. However, it is no guarantee that the U.S. will make a bold funding pledge. To allow the Global Fund to reach its $15 billion target, the U.S. needs to pledge $5 billion for 2014-2016. For every $1 the U.S. donates, the Global Fund leverages $2 from other donors.
Considering our era of hyper-polarized politics and our recent government shutdown, it may surprise you that this is a topic on which Republicans and Democrats have been able to agree. Earlier this year, both the House of Representatives and the Senate allocated $1.65 billion to the Global Fund in their respective FY 2014 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bills. Funding for international health and development programs accounts for less than one percent of the U.S. budget, and yet it leads to tremendous results in human survival, economic development, and global security.
Let us urge our members of Congress and President Obama to stand in support of the Global Fund and pledge $5 billion at the December pledging conference. Investing now can lead to truly amazing results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alice Munro won the Nobel Prize in Literature this year. Her prize-winning collections of short stories reflect her keen observations of human behavior and succinct, effortless explication of the complexities of women’s relationships. Any survey of her career is bound to trace an almost predetermined course of prolific output earning a string of sterling accolades including the Canadian Governor General’s Award (multiple times) and the Man Booker International Prize.
Through press coverage, Alice Munro has become a Nobel Laureate of numbers: the second Canadian author recognized by the Swedish Academy—or the first, depending on how the U.S., Canada, and King Solomon would prefer to have Saul Bellow divvied up—and the 13th woman writer so honored with diploma, medal, and eight million kronor. “Can this be possible? It seems dreadful there’s only 13 of us,” Munro said, learning of her victory and its significance.
I can guarantee there’s a far more important number we won’t be hearing, though. Eighteen. It’s the number of members of the Swedish Academy: eighteen appointees who hold their seats for life, like their counterparts in the Académie Français. In Swedish they refer to themselves as De Aderton, and it’s bitingly apt that aderton is an obsolete, archaic form of the number—arton is the modern form. Established in 1786, the Academy’s main purpose is to advance (or police) the Swedish language through publishing dictionaries. Svenska Akademiens ordbok (Dictionary of the Swedish Academy, equivalent to the Oxford English Dictionary) started rolling out with Volume A in 1898—they are currently stuck on Volume U. The Swedish Academy began awarding the Prize in Literature in 1901.
Even in gender-egalitarian Sweden, men hold the bulk of seats in the Academy. Women hold five seats; a sixth woman will join on December 20, and, with the death of Ulf Linde on October 7, perhaps a seventh. The reluctant selection of women, one might guess, could be rooted in the Academy itself.
I think the whole world is applauding the selection of Munro, who is most often compared to Chekhov for the appealing and affecting style of her stories. However, the 18 members of the Swedish Academy have much of a mess to clean up. A fine choice, like Munro, will ultimately do them no good if they maintain a myopic focus on novelists and playwrights or continue to ignore women’s writings and non-political fiction.
Unlike the Nobel Prizes awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or the Karolinska Institute, the Prize in Literature has been highly contentious, rife with political tests and subjective criteria of worth. Writers of substantial import—Borges, Joyce, Nabokov, Proust—have been snubbed. Writers of dubious merit have enjoyed the prize; in 2005 Knut Ahnlund refused further participation in the work of the Academy in protest of the selection of Elfriede Jelinek as Laureate in 2004, calling her work “a mass of text shoveled together without artistic structure.”
Accusations of politicization have plagued both the Prize in Literature and the Nobel Peace Prize. Yet in choosing Munro, the Academy can begin to restore global respectability to the award. Her fiction focuses on her own Southern Ontario, Canada, and is hardly political in comparison with a Jelinek, a Harold Pinter, or a Dario Fo.
That said, picking woman after woman after woman until reaching a ratio more favorable than 13 out of 110 is not a solution workable in the long run. It won’t add to the prestige of the prize; it might tarnish those who receive the award if the only relevant factor in selection is sex. One of Munro’s strengths is that she is a great writer. Period. No need for the mealy-mouthed qualifier of “woman-writer.”
Moreover, picking anglophone after anglophone writer will not solve the credibility problem. The Nobel Prize in Literature is not going to regain its universal renown by becoming the Man Booker clone. It recognizes great literary achievement without respect to language or borders; it has worked to transcend its Eurocentric past and must continue to do so. The English-reading public is enormously large and I believe the Prize is at its best when it promotes works not widely read in English, when it helps to preserve the dignity of minority languages and linguistic diversity.
Let me mention a final figure—one: the number of novels Munro has published. Munro is an anomaly; she has made a career from the short story during an era of its decline. Outside of literary magazines or pretended literary magazines, publishers are wary to print collections of stories, readers—those who are left—prefer the novel or non-fiction including memoir and current events.
The Swedish Academy has awarded Alice Munro a well-deserved prize, the culmination of her literary career of fifty-plus productive years. The 18 have taken a step toward improving the sexist scorecard, but many steps remain in order for the prize to catch up with the literary present. And once caught up, I hope the Prize will provide leadership in the world of literature as it continues to promote writers unknown in English and writers keeping alive the struggling genres necessary for a vibrant literary culture.

“You don’t want people who are in the play just to represent certain ideas. You want the ideas to be fluid and dialectical, dangerous.”
An outspoken social and political critic, Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer-winning playwright and screenwriter who uses “Reaganite” like a swearword and ties everything back to Walter Benjamin. His written works include “Angels in America,” “Homebody/Kabul,” “A Bright Room Called Day,” “Hyriotaphia,” “Slavs!,” the musical “Caroline or Change,” a new translation of Brecht’s "Mother Courage,” and the films “Munich” and “Lincoln.” He received the National Medal of Arts from President Obama this year.
When Kushner visited Harvard two weeks ago to receive the W.E.B. Du Bois Medal, he remained in Cambridge for only a few hours before flying around the country—to Manhattan, to California, and then back to upstate New York. He called me from Syracuse University, where he visited classes and appeared in an onstage Q&A about his work. He told me he loves talking with students: “This is not teaching, but it’s the closest I can get to teaching right now,” he said. I asked him why he decided to stop teaching, and our interview got started:
1. TK: I have some real questions about the teaching of playwriting on a graduate level, which is the way that I taught for five years at NYU…. Most playwrights write 10 or 12 or 15 really serious plays in their lifetime. Shakespeare wrote 38 and Shaw wrote 39 just to spite Shakespeare, but you don’t have a huge number of plays in you, and I don’t know that in your mid-twenties you should be thinking of the work that you’re doing as homework assignments. And the part of it that I really don’t understand—it’s very counterintuitive to me—is that you take a play that you’re in the process of working on in the first draft, which is such an excruciatingly difficult and vulnerable time, and you take a scene and bring it into a room full of other writers and read it out loud to them, and they tell you what they think you should do with it. It just seems crazy to me, and a real way to knock yourself off whatever kind of balance beam you’re trying to tread.
If you teach playwriting, I think you become to some extent an editor. You’re looking at somebody else’s writing, and you’re trying to apply a kind of critical, knowing eye to what somebody else has done. It switches on a part of your brain that I, at least, find very difficult to work with when I’m trying to really invent, especially a first draft.
But then you’re sitting there saying to a playwriting student, “This line is a problem,” “Here’s where you lose track of this,” “Here’s why this scene ceases to be about action and becomes novelistic,” “Do you need this line?” “Can you condense this?” “What about this structural element?” Some of that can be good advice, but then you go and sit down at your own desk and start writing, and you hear your voice saying these things to you. I don’t edit and write at the same time, when I’m doing a first draft. I’m sure some people feel that I should edit a lot more, but the editing part comes later. It’s just a different head, so I find it very hard to teach classes and then go back and write.
2. FM: Did you ever take a writing class?
TK: I think I took two, actually, at Columbia. There were no arts majors at Columbia when I was a student there—undergraduate student there—so there was no possibility of majoring in playwriting, which I think was a great thing.
3. FM: What sort of things were you writing? What were your plays about?
TK: The first class was one semester, and I just wrote one weird little scene, about a middle-aged man who throws a paint balloon at the local branch of his bank. That’s literally all I remember about it. And then in my senior year I took another playwriting class and I wrote a play about the dedication of the cathedral at Rouen.
A lot of very late medieval-early Renaissance ecclesiastical luminaries showed up to dedicate the cathedral, which was, as I remember, one of the signature moments of the beginning of the gothic period, and sort of the flowering of scholasticism giving way to humanism and all that stuff. I wrote it in this incredible caffeine-induced writing marathon of like three weeks at the end of the second semester so that I could graduate on time, in between marching around campus and pretending that it was not 1978 but 1968. I’ve got the manuscript somewhere, but it’s probably horrible. It sounds horrible!
4. FM: You’ve read a lot of theory, and you’ve said that Walter Benjamin has influenced your work. How?
TK: Well I mean obviously in one way. In the “Theses on the Philosophy of History,” he talks about the angel as being blown backwards from paradise to the future—the backward looking angel, this figure of reaction and regret and loss. I had a dream, and that was the origin of the angel in “Angels in America.” The “Theses on the Philosophy of History” is just so gorgeous; it’s this incredible prose poem. And that’s had an enormous impact on me, as well as his ideas about ownership in “Unpacking My Library,” and the relationship to the inorganic, intimacy with the inorganic, in “The Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” the marriage of Jewish mysticism and Messianism with Marxism and the revolutionary politics of the time.
5. FM: When you’re working on something new, do you start by thinking about big concepts, or do you start with characters and plotlines, and which do you think is a bigger focus for you?
TK: It really depends. Sometimes I have an idea for a character or a story; sometimes I have a title; sometimes I get hired by Steven Spielberg, and he tells me what he wants me to write about—I wouldn’t say yes to a project if he said, “I want you to write about x,” and it was something that I just didn’t feel any particular interest in writing.
6. FM: Why did you take on those projects, then?
TK: Kathy Kennedy, Steven’s producer, wanted to meet me, and she told me she was working on this film about the Israeli athletes who were murdered and a film about Abraham Lincoln, and I wound up writing both of those film. When she described what she and Steven were doing, I was really surprised because I assumed that Steven’s politics would be much more mainstream in terms of Israel. And I was really thrilled to hear that they were doing something that sounded to me like it was very risky and brave in terms of the way that it might be received.
I wanted to write a movie—I’d never written one before—and I thought it’d be sort of fun. I’d never written anything like “Munich,” where people are chasing each other and shooting each other and stuff like that. And I’ve written about the Middle East conflict, so I was happy to have a context to explore some really difficult questions—the terribly difficult questions of the legality and criminality of conducting missions on foreign soil, against foreign nationals, and the very very dark and troubling grey area, if it’s even a grey area, that you run into with this.
The main fun, for me, of writing is that it’s a way of really churning your own way through something that you don’t understand, without any guarantee that you’ll come up with an answer, but that you’ll maybe clarify all the questions for yourself. And “Munich” just seemed like it would be a really interesting way to address this. I always thought I would write about the Middle East at some point dramatically. I never thought I would get into this particular subject, but I could tell that it grabbed me. I immediately started thinking of things I wanted to do with it. An idea can also start with a larger sort of theoretical or philosophical or theological question, and then you start to look for a story that seems to be a congenial kind of home for that.
7. FM: How do you find that story?
TK: You sort of free associate. There’s no one answer to that. With the last thing that I wrote, “The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures,” there was a civic, political thing that I’ve been grappling with a lot in the last twenty years, of the revolution-versus-evolution question in progressive politics. The nature of the idea of “revolution”—and this is going back to Walter Benjamin.
You hear a lot of people talking about it, and it’s not clear what is meant now. What has the idea of revolution actually done to progressive politics or for progressive politics? I wanted to explore the fact that I seem to have become more interested in radical change through evolutionary means, which is something I used to have great contempt for. Is that just because I’m now 57, and I’m getting old and weary and complacent? My father was at that point beginning to succumb to kidney disease, which killed him finally about a year and a half ago, so I was beginning to deal with that. And there was a strike of stagehands in New York, and I had some really surprising arguments with other playwrights and people of the theater, who I would assume would be pro-union and who sounded like union-busting Reaganite creeps, and I thought, “God, the language has changed dramatically.”
So I started thinking about all that stuff, and I eventually wound up with an old man and his children, and it just evolved. That takes a while. You don’t want to create a story that’s just an allegory. Allegories are fine, but they’re a little bit dead as drama. You don’t want people who are in the play just to represent certain ideas. You want the ideas to be fluid and dialectical, dangerous. So you put the intellectual investigation aside for a bit and dig into your story. The main thing is that you let the characters do what they need to do rather than insist that they follow your little schematic, which is something you need to have as a security blanket to get you started, but then if the characters really have life in them, they’ll start to dictate certain things.
8. FM: How do they do that?
TK: As you’re writing a scene, you sit there and you make six attempts to write a scene that your outline says should happen next. You realize with increasing dread that it isn’t what should happen next, and that you can’t figure out the scene because the person that you’ve been in the process of assembling would never do the things that that person would have to do for the scene to happen.
Or a pleasurable thing: you suddenly wake up in the middle of the night and think, “Oh my god, the next scene is this, and I don’t know how that connects to anything, but I’m gonna write it and see where it goes from there.” And it’s always a shoveling back and forth between what you intend and the kind of stuff your unconscious is churning up and all the different people inside of you are churning up. You have to be able to hear them as well as maintain some semblance of structure and causality and so on.

Dear Dean Pfister,
When people ask me what the greatest thing about Harvard has been,I respond with your name. The silent “P” is music to my ears,whispers to my soul.Donald H. Pfister. Yea, I looked up your middle initial.
I never see you, yet your emails let me know that you are around.Reading a Louise Penny mystery novel,contemplating the declining bee population,looking at leavesand feeling like an inspector. This is enough for me.
Every time I am a little down, I check my inbox, open an email, and enjoy the foliage.  Even though I am one of thousands,I don’t need a bcc to know that I am special to you.Your reminders to get my flu shot, and to read the article about Beekeepers, let me know that you value my personal health.
You remind me what is truly important in life— bees and mystery novels. And help me enjoy the little thingslike the academic integrity workshop last Thursday.
Your perfect prose,nurtures my soul and I want you to know that I enjoyed the Blog you recommended, the one about São Paulo. I look forward to more fungi puns, you fun guy. I identified with the shrooms.

A few weeks ago, the Harvard administration announced some unsettling news. After a lengthy search, a donor for the long-proposed student center had finally been secured. Though construction won’t start on the building for quite some time, the center will likely feature large spaces that can be used for parties, events, and lectures, as well as smaller areas for less formal gatherings.
Do you see the problem yet? Despite the misguided enthusiasm of some students, the space will ultimately be useless: it’s downright wasteful to spend untold millions of dollars constructing a student center when the Porcellian already serves the same basic functions.
The Porcellian (or P.C. as it’s sometimes affectionately called) has been a campus staple since 1794, and centuries of experience have taught members that less is more. Instead of the sprawling compound of lecture halls, meeting rooms, and social spaces, the club makes do with a narrow little enclave nestled between Yenching and J. August. The top two floors are an Elysian garden, wisely restricted to members-only so as not to overwhelm mere mortals with its unearthly pleasures. Select guests can still visit the ground floor of the club’s Massachusetts Avenue address, which the Olympians in the P.C. have generously made accessible.
And here is where their wisdom is apparent. Years after the construction of the SOCH, that building lays fallow except for the offices of a few student organizations. The lobby’s flat screen televisions remain black and the billiards table silent because Harvard students are addicted to exclusivity. Other common spaces on campus are flooded with the flotsam of countless lesser organizations on campus. Take a meal in any dining hall on campus and you risk subjecting yourself to the members of the Model United Nations team, the local House Committee, or even (god-forbid) the Crimson Business Board.
The members of the Porcellian are aware of this basic truth and it shows. As for those deemed unworthy of that hallowed old barn, it’s really for their own good. Rejection is the fount of ambition. Both Franklin D. Roosevelt Class of 1904 and John F. Kennedy ’40 failed to be elected to the P.C. The former would later refer to that event as “the greatest disappointment in his life.” Both men later went on to become President. Coincidence? I think not. If a non-discriminating social space had existed while these men went to school, this magazine could very well have been written in German, under the threat of a nuclear Cuba.
A new, open student center presents a dangerous threat to the status quo. Without the guiding influence of the Porcellian to teach us the sting of being an outsider and instilling a need for acceptance in our hearts, the next batch of America’s leaders may very well graduate well-adjusted. I shudder for the future generations.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Oct. 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the class year of Franklin D. Roosevelt. In fact, he graduated with the Class of 1904.

An elderly Russian chess player who charges two dollars per game often sets up shop on the patio outside the Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square. A consistent crowd of tourists wanders in and out of the adjacent Holyoke Center, but this Mass. Ave. hotspot has recently developed a musical dimension: a public piano now graces the street corner, one of many pianos installed by Luke Jerram’s international “Play Me, I’m Yours” project. In celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Celebrity Series of Boston which features local performances by internationally recognized musicians, the project has installed 75 pianos on the streets of Boston from September 27 to October 14.
In the middle of the lunch rush on an unusually warm October Tuesday, the piano, sturdily perched beside ABP’s familiar iron patio, is attracting a variety of musicians, from a group of college kids hammering out “Chopsticks” to seasoned piano players armed with 10 pages of sheet music. Strolling down Mass. Ave, the diligent serenade of a ten-year-old emerges. She is surrounded by her gushing parents, passerbys who occasionally dip in to brush at her keys.
By evening, the piano is occupied by a young self-described “hipster,” a former member of the Boston University Arts Initiative that worked with the Celebrity Series to bring the “Play Me, I’m Yours” project to Boston. The recent BU grad sits solidly on the piano bench with his newsboy cap pulled slightly down. “Pianos really bring people together...people who otherwise wouldn’t associate with one another,” he says. “Accessible, public art like this—it’s what makes a community.”
The self-taught musician has amassed a small audience of strangers who hum along to his heartfelt acoustic-rock performance. A young, tired looking woman with two worn duffel bags and a long brown coat sings along enthusiastically to his rendition of “City of Ruins” by Bruce Springsteen, his “all-time favorite song.” Meanwhile, those who stream out of the Holyoke Center pause for a minute, swaying calmly to the music and sometimes snapping a picture or two.
A few quiet minutes after he finishes his performance, the empty bench is approached by a former Harvard librarian with long white hair and a weathered expression, who says he was enjoying the freedom of his recent retirement. He wrestles his way through a group of eastern European tourists to reach the piano, taking advantage of the cloudy fall evening to use the instrument that he has studied for more than four decades. “I actually had a dream that I saw someone playing the piano in the street,” he says. A smile creeps across his face. The following day, he said, he stumbled across one of Boston’s newly installed pianos. “It was wonderful,” he remembers. Since his discovery, he’s been playing the pianos in different locations across Boston.
The librarian departs and a flustered Harvard sophomore hustling out of Boylston Gate notices the piano by ABP as she rushes. She stops to sit down at the bench so rarely empty, and begins to issue a smooth rendition of “Bella’s Lullaby” from Twlight a piece she taught herself. Long after the performance, idle notes can be heard into the early hours of the morning.
Two days later, the piano is still subject to a steady stream of eager musicians. One young couple waits for 15 minutes to use the piano, rushing excitedly to the bench the second its former occupant leaves. The woman sits close to her male companion with closed eyes and a lazy smile, singing along quietly as he performs “Hold On,” by Muse—one of his favorite songs to listen to and to play.
Another woman, flanked by two young children, exits the Holyoke Center and the instrument catches her by surprise (“Ooo! There’s a piano!” she exclaims). She eagerly jumps on the empty bench to test her memory of “Heart and Soul,” as the youngsters join in, wandering aimlessly and playfully through the instrument’s upper register.

Harvard University Stand Up Comedy Society members meet under the broken, flickering lights of the Quincy House Spindell Room. The question they’re answering differs from those of the p-setters crushing brain break in the adjacent dining hall: “How old were you when you found out Santa wasn’t real?”
The discussion moves to upcoming comedy events, interrupted by more serious matters like q-tips and sex toys. The meeting is popcorn-style, with the comedians jumping in to pitch their newest jokes.
The group, which consists of more than 20 members, is the only official student group for stand up comedians. “I think everyone has a funny side,” said Ethan G. Loewi ’15, who joined HUSUCS this year. “It’s just people who do stand up comedy are more aware of their funny side and are more eager to share it.”
One way to share that funny side is through performing on-campus at on-campus events like Winthrop Stein Club. A half-hour before the show, the 10 featured comedians huddle tensely in tight circles, scribbling down notes and mouthing the words to their sets.
“Wide Awake” and “Safe and Sound” blast out from speakers to break the pre-show tension before the audience arrives. Stand up veteran Manny I. “Fox” Morone ’14, who’s sporting a casual gray hoodie and running sneakers for the performance, shakes his hips to the music.
“Really, you only get nervous if you haven’t gone on stage in a while,” Morone explained. “It’s really completely related to your confidence in your own material. If you go on stage and are like ‘I know this is funny,’ then you won’t be nervous.”
Minutes later, the comedians garner laughs from a crowded Junior Common Room. Laughter is essential to any successful stand up performance. “I don’t have a fear of performing or public speaking,” Loewi said, “but stand up is a whole different animal, because you need the audience to laugh.”
Starting Out Stand Up
For many group members, HUSUCS was their introduction into stand-up comedy. Dan J. Fitzpatrick ’15, HUSUCS co-president, got involved in HUSUCS simply to try something new. “I first heard about it at the activities fair my freshman year,” Fitzpatrick explained, stroking his chin. “I’d always been sort of interested in comedy, so I thought I’d give that a whirl.”
Morone jumped into the stand up world by performing at a comedy club off-campus during his freshman fall. The show “just went really, really poorly,” Morone said. “It wasn’t even like a bad crowd—sometimes you can blame it on the crowd, but I couldn’t.”
Despite what he deemed a “really shitty” performance, Morone kept pursuing stand up. “That’s the point where you kind of say like, ‘This is something that I like to do,’” Morone said. “It’s that thing that even if you’re bad at it you still want to get better or keep doing it.”
Like Morone’s own comedy, the HUSUCS has also evolved. When Morone joined in 2010, “it was a really, really small group, like about five people,” he said. The group was officially recognized by the College in 2007, and has expanded since.
“We’re a really tight group I think,” Fitzpatrick said. “We certainly have gotten a lot more  prominent and larger over the last couple of years or so. Last fall we made a really big recruiting effort and since then we’ve just made a bigger push to advertise our shows.”
Devon M. Guinn ’17, one of the youngest performers at the Stein Club show, has already established a place in the group. Guinn’s set ranges from Super Mario to Tibetan throat singing impressions. At one point in the Winthrop Stein Club show, after asking an audience member  where she’s from, Guinn replies, “Oh really? I’d guess you were from Tennessee… Because I bet it hurt when you fell from the sk - Oh shit,” and then walks off stage, getting a high five or two from his fellow stand up comedians. “It’s fun, because everyone’s really welcoming,” Guinn said. “There are fun opportunities for freshmen to do shows.”
Sierra L. Katow ’16 started doing stand up shows at clubs in Los Angeles, her hometown, at the age of 16, but recognizes the depth of opportunity for stand up comedians at Harvard. “It’s interesting, because back in the real world, or whatever you want to call it, you have to wait in line for a few hours just to get three minutes on stage when you’re not established yet,” Katow said. “Here, there are so many opportunities.”
Comedians Off-Campus
Outside of HUSUCS, a few members are involved in stand up comedy in the greater Boston area. Morone and Fitzpatrick have performed at The Comedy Studio, located above Hong Kong, and at ImprovBoston, an improvisational theater in Cambridge.
Both found that there is a significant difference between performing for Harvard and non-Harvard audiences. “I think Harvard audiences are probably smarter and more polite,” Fitzpatrick said. “I think just because we’re all students at the same school they probably have more incentive to root for you to do well, whereas other people don’t care as much.”
For Morone, performing for non-Harvard audiences is good practice. “I think it’s useful, because you get an audience that represents most people instead of an audience of people that you basically see every day,” he said.
Katow, has also found success performing outside of the Harvard community. She performed during the summer, and is “finally getting paid at some colleges,” she said.
Although the world of stand up is relatively male-dominated, Katow has carved out a place for herself. “I’ve noticed being a woman in comedy, because there’s so few of you, is almost an advantage,” Katow said. “You have a certain point-of-view, and stand up comedy is all about telling your own story.”
Developing a Voice
When thinking of how to tell their own story, the Harvard stand up comedians are constantly scouring their environments for inspiration. According to Fitzpatrick, there’s no formula for joke-creating. “Most of the time you can’t just sit down and write something, you have to just have something pop into your head,” he explained. “And that can come from any random stream of consciousness or conversation with friends or something else you came across or were reading.”
This constant search for material can prove to be difficult. “It’s labor-intensive,” Loewi said. “People don’t realize. On stage, you’ve got to make it look casual.”
Before performing, Morone works on his jokes without sharing them with others. “It is still a very lonely activity in that I don’t like to share my material with people until I perform it, unless maybe if they’re in the stand up group,” Morone said. “I rehearse whatever to myself like the day before. It can be for many hours, just me alone in a room.”
Each comedian has his or her own style; some students prefer punchy jokes, while others create more story-based sets. Fitzpatrick prefers “jokes that are on the shorter side but have a very absurdist twist to them,” Fitzpatrick said. “Also ones that are clever but not necessarily being extremely dirty.” For example, one joke he wrote goes, “Why can’t Jesus ever finish the New York Times Sunday Puzzle? Because he always gets stuck on across.”
Comedian Anthony H. Zonfrelli ’14 is known at HUSUCS as “the master of the one-liner.” For Zonfrelli, it’s critical that he memorizes his jokes perfectly. “My set up is distinct, and if I screw up even just one word, everyone knows that was a failed attempt at a joke,” Zonfrelli said.
Zonfrelli ends the Stein Club set with one of his favorites. “I’m always really respectful to my girlfriends,” Zonfrelli begins with a straight face. “Especially in the beginning of a relationship. For instance, I never take a girl out to a rated-R movie on the first date. I want her to think of me as a nicer, more innocent guy. Not just a guy who can get her into rated-R movies.”
After the Punchline
As the Stein Club Show wraps up, the comedians gather their backpacks and split ways to walk home. It’s a Thursday night, so no post-show party. Katow, who came from a midterm, is about to go study. Within minutes, the JCR is empty except for a few Winthrop residents who linger by the alcohol.
For most of these performers stand up comedy is still a part-time gig at the moment. However, Morone thinks he will continue performing “at the very least on the side, if I can,” he says. “I think I’m okay at it, and not only that, but you see a lot of people who are objectively worse than me who at least kind of make a living.”
Fitzpatrick agrees that he wants to stick with comedy. “Everybody sucks for years at a time before they get good,” he explained. “You really have to do it for years before you find your voice and build a reputation for yourself.”

“Will I be safer?” Birtukan Midekssa echoes. She lets out a laugh, pauses, then shakes her head, but her wide smile doesn’t flicker. “I don’t know,” she says. “Honestly.”
Midekssa, nearing 40, comfortably recalls her experience as a fellow in Harvard’s Scholars at Risk program from the courtyard of Harvard Kennedy School, where she is now a student in the Mason Mid-Career Program for leaders from developing countries. Midekssa is one of many scholars who have sought protection through Harvard’s branch of the SAR network, an international community of academic institutions defending academic freedom and human rights worldwide.
Midekssa, who worked as a federal judge for the criminal court and then as a politician in Ethiopia, arrived in the U.S. after finding a shrinking space for political involvement in her home country. She had been imprisoned twice after she and other leaders of her party, Unity for Democracy and Justice, were accused of treason, among other charges. Both accusations sentenced her to life in jail; she was released after 21 months during the first sentence due to international pressure; during her second, she was held in solitary confinement for 18 months.
I ask her if she would be safer the next time she returned to Ethiopia after participating in Harvard’s Scholars at Risk program.
“[The program] is really helpful in terms of personality development and enriching my understanding and knowledge,” Midekssa answers, then stops. “But in terms of security, I’m not sure.”
Space On Campus
The Scholars at Risk Network, a program that was started in the Human Rights Center at University of Chicago in 1999 and relocated to New York University  in 2003, markets its mission as an extension of the international support offered to European scholars facing persecution in the ’30s and ’40s. Harvard opened its own chapter in 2002, under the initiative of Jacqueline Bhabha, Professor of the Practice of Health and Human Rights at the Harvard School of Public Health and a past chair of the program while she was working at the University of Chicago, and Stephen J. Greenblatt, John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities. Bhabha believes that the network’s mission of protecting scholars and artists still resonates even 80 years later: “Today in our period scholars face risks that are no less grave,” she explains.
Harvard sponsors three to four scholars every year; they are selected based on nominations and the level of personal risk faced in the home country. Past scholars have included Iranian novelist Shahriar Mandanipour and Cambodian poet Tararith Kho, as well as filmmakers, historians, activists, and artists from across the globe.
Those involved say that Harvard’s Scholars at Risk program is among the biggest and best in the country; Bhabha points to its network of affiliates from different corners of the university as the primary factor. The program, however, still suffers from limited funds: It is supported in small portions by the University, grants from different departments, scholarships, and individual sponsors.
“It will always require a tremendous amount of volunteer work,” Greenblatt says, noting the difficulty the Committee faces while deciding who they can support. “We could always go further than we do.”
Expanding Voices
Once on campus, scholars can interact with the Harvard community as they wish. Some, like Midekssa, choose to speak up about their presence on campus as Scholars at Risk and participate in public events, even inviting students over for dinner; others keep mum for their safety. The scholars are supported by all of Harvard’s resources and the immediate Scholars at Risk community, providing more than academic assistance.
“It’s not only about saving someone’s life, but someone’s spirit,” Greenblatt says. “That means integrating someone as best as you can into the community,” providing medical, legal, and familial assistance.
While Midekssa and others involved in the program at Harvard stress the unparalleled academic resources offered on campus, all speak more emphatically about the strong Scholars at Risk community that continues to grow and expand every year. Scholars abroad, especially those in exile, often feel detached from the community, Midekssa says: “The academic pursuit has a lot of meaning—it’s a very valuable goal—but if it were not glossed with that type of family networking [that SAR provides], it could have been incomplete: that spirit, the commitment, and the solidarity.”
One source of this community’s vitality and growth are the contributions of students from across the University who have become involved in growing numbers. Student interest in Scholars at Risk is often sparked in Jane Unrue’s “The Voice of Authority,” a freshman Expository Writing class. Unrue, a dedicated member of the Scholars at Risk committee, facilitates discussions in class about human rights and organizes interaction with some of the scholars.
After taking the class as freshmen, two students, Nadia L. Farjood ’13 and Nicholas E. Jofre ’13, joined the SAR Faculty Committee as undergarduate co-chairs. With Ivet A. Bell ’13, another classmate, they then formed a student group called Harvard College Students for Scholars at Risk, aiming to increase undergraduate interest in the program and other human rights initiatives across campus. They and other students in the class helped organize the first “Living Magazine,” a performance and reading event in which the scholars, aided by students who also read and translated their work, shared their ordinarily censored work with the Harvard community.
Edwin L. Whitman ’15 is a current member of HCSSAR who also took Unrue’s class his freshman year. “The hardest challenge for [HCSSAR] is to create a genuine understanding of what risk means for scholars, and what risk means for scholarship,” he says, speaking of the group’s future direction. “In our day-to-day lives on campus, we’re not really presented with… understanding what it means to have a protected voice, or the safety that comes with crafting our voice.”
HCSSAR is currently working on an online publication similar to “The Living Magazine.” Members of the student group hope they will serve as tangible testament to the importance of academic freedom worldwide, inspiring students to join the conversation about free press and human rights as Unrue’s class has.
Now graduated, Farjood speaks of one of her most memorable experiences during her involvement, a holiday party: There were scholars from Albania, Cambodia, Iran, Eritrea, she remembers—“even some people who couldn’t understand each other” at the home of a physics professor in Cambridge. “It looked like a UN assembly meeting, and it just felt like a family.”

Beyond Cambridge
As highly praised as Harvard’s SAR chapter is, Midekssa’s response to the original question—Will you feel safer when you return to Ethiopia, after having participated in SAR?—is indicative of its limits. SAR grapples with how to show public support for the scholars’ work while maintaining their privacy, and how to maintain its successes despite an ever-tight budget.
And although allies in the Harvard community do their best to find future opportunities for scholars approaching the end of their year in the program, positions within the University are not guaranteed.
“When we began, I naively thought that the presence of Harvard would make it safer for that person to return to the country,” Greenblatt says, “that even a persecuting regime doesn’t want to look that bad.” For Midekssa, as for others, this is not always the case. The Scholars at Risk program establishes many supportive relationships, she says, “but at the same time that makes you a target.“
So the future for Midekssa and scholars like her remains unclear.
“I will be staying here a bit, spending some time here,” she trails off, staring at some point just past eye contact. One day, she knows, she’ll return to Ethiopia with the SAR network still in reach.

It may be 67 degrees outside, but inside the rink it’s more like 45, and out there, on the ice, it feels like winter. A pack of hockey players zooms across the surface, blades scraping up small blizzards; pucks hit the boards with such force that for a split second you’re afraid the plexiglass will shatter.
It’s Monday at the Edge Sports Center in Bedford, Mass., and the 25 members of the U.S. women’s hockey team have started their practice. The date is Sept. 30, 2013, and there are 131 days until the team will compete against Finland in its first contest of the XXII Olympic Winter Games.
Clad in red, white, and blue Team USA practice jerseys, the women line up for speed drills. Veterans like Julie Chu ’07 will race against players who haven’t yet graduated from high school for a spot on the final 21-player roster and a trip to Sochi, Russia for the Olympics. The youngest member of the team, 16-year-old Jincy Dunne, hadn’t even picked up a hockey stick when Chu won the first of her three Olympic medals in Salt Lake City, Utah.
“Stay up,” says their coach, Katey Stone, as the players finish sprinting from one end of the rink to the other.
Stone, who is bundled up in dark layers, skates slowly and speaks loudly. Her assistant coaches, Bobby Jay and Hillary Witt, dart about during an intrasquad scrimmage.
“Keep moving,” bellows Stone, who has been the head coach of Harvard’s Women’s Ice Hockey since 1994. “We’re going to play teams that are good.”
To five members of this practice squad, Stone’s words are familiar marching orders—a quintet of national team players are either current or former members of the Harvard women’s hockey team.
A final exercise sees the team break into groups of three and, in succession, attempt to score on the team’s goaltenders. After almost two hours of intensity-laden drills, the women rally around one another, cheering and hollering, and the practice suddenly feels more like a casual pick-up game between friends than preparation for moments of immense international pressure.
It may be September, but the team very much has the February Olympics on their minds. There’s a chronic lack of public interest in women’s hockey, but some believe that a stellar performance in the 2014 Olympics may bring about a sort of renaissance in the field of women’s hockey.
Lack of interest is an all-too-familiar phrase for the five current and former members of the Harvard team currently representing the USA. The Harvard women’s hockey team is one of the most successful teams on campus, but struggles to maintain fan attendance levels, which average about one quarter the total of their male counterparts. It’s a familiar story for many female athletes on campus, and one that the women’s hockey players hope their international recognition can help to change.
“When the US National team won the gold medal in 1998,” Michelle L. Picard ’15-’16 explains, “the number of girls playing hockey grew so much. I think there’ll be the same effect, so hopefully we can make it happen.”
STONE COLD FOX
Katey Stone, the winningest women’s hockey coach in NCAA history, operates at a certain level of obscurity amidst the larger Harvard student body. Despite Stone’s 402 victories and nine NCAA tournament appearances, Harvard students are much more likely to identify men’s basketball coach Tommy Amaker, with his two trips to the national tournament while coaching at Harvard, as the most successful coach on campus.
A former captain of the University of New Hampshire women’s hockey team, which captured two ECAC titles during her time there, Stone has also enjoyed success as a coach on the national level. She has coached the various national teams multiple times over the past two decades, most recently leading Team USA to a gold medal at the 2013 World Championships in Ottawa this past winter.
Stone’s pale blue eyes give a piercing stare across the ice. She speaks with calm intent and a fierce modesty and is quick to give credit to her team.
“Honestly, this isn’t about me,” Stone says, “it’s not about the coaches—it’s about the players and us trying to help them get what they want and achieve their goals, whether we’re at Harvard trying to compete for a national championship or on a national team trying to win a gold medal.”
Just as Stone has been immensely successful as an individual, so too has she bred similar levels of accomplishment in the women who have passed through her program.
Members of her team have won the national Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, the women’s hockey equivalent to college football’s Heisman Trophy, six times during the 15-year history of the prize. Nine former players, either representing the United States or Canada, have competed at the four Olympic games that have included women’s hockey, and all nine have medaled.
“Everyone walks away and she’s changed their life forever,” says Laura C. Bellamy ’13, who this year has been hired by Harvard as an assistant coach for her former team. “She’s the most competitive person ever, [and] her knowledge of the game is second to none. She’s the best coach in the world.”
The current team roster, which was announced after a weeklong selection camp in Lake Placid, N.Y. in late June, features Harvard and the University of Minnesota, last year’s NCAA champions and the holders of a record 49-game win streak, as its most represented schools. After paring down the camp from 41 elite American players to just 25, USA Women’s Hockey and Stone will have to weed out four more players in December for the final Olympic count.
Josephine U. Pucci ’13-’15 is one of the five Harvard players, and, as for many, her journey to the Olympic team hasn’t been easy. Pucci, who has already garnered a gold and silver medal competing for the USA at the 2011 and 2012 World Championships, suffered a concussion while playing for the Under-22 team during the summer of 2012. On the cusp of her senior season, she chose to withdraw from the College to rehabilitate her health.
Pucci spent the next several months in Atlanta working with Dr. Ted Carrick, a neurologist who has accrued fame for his research on concussions and has worked with several injured NHL players. Never to be discouraged, she made a return to Boston by January and has since shed any notion that her injury need be career-ending.
“I think it’s been a long way back for Josephine,” Stone says. “She’s really done everything she could to put herself in a healthy position...everything she was asked to do to clear herself, to be able to play and to compete for an opportunity here.”
Pucci is not the only member of Team USA who have endured difficulties on her way toward becoming an Olympian.
Kate Buesser ’11 was cut from the national program in 2010 and began professional life with medical school and a research post at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Buesser, who continued to play as a member of the Boston Blades club team, wrote to Stone after the Blades won the Clarkson Cup and was soon asked to attend the selection camp.
“I hadn’t been lifting weights or anything, because I was working full time,” Buesser says about making the transition from medical school to Olympic hockey. “I took seven weeks off to get in shape, and prepare; I didn’t want to have any excuses.”
Picard and Lyndsey B. Fry ’14-’15, other members of the Harvard quintet, are taking a break from undergraduate life and a team that captured a joint Ivy League title last season.
The two, who have been friends since playing on the Under-18 national team together before Harvard, claimed that the national team training has been similar to Harvard on the ice, yet the off-ice and mental commitment levels have increased.
“Everybody on this team was the star of their school team, and then going into this unbelievable group, it’s hard to hang on to your confidence,” says Fry, who was last year’s number two scorer on the Harvard team. “My role is gonna be different, but I’m gonna embrace that role and play it to the best of my ability.”
“[During practice] you can’t take breaks, you can’t skip drills—you’re being challenged and pushed every single day,” Fry explains. “The competition is so high in practice...We’re competing for spots. [There are] still four cuts to be made.”
Peers point to Stone as one of the reasons why the women’s hockey scene has gotten much more competitive.
“It used to be that our women’s Olympic team would have a mix of some really young kids, but now it’s more and more difficult to make the team, because there are more good players and it’s more competitive,” says Ted Donato ’91, the head coach of the Harvard men’s hockey team and a member of the 1989 national-champion Crimson squad. “I definitely attribute that to a number of factors, number one being the success in the Olympic teams and some terrific coaches—Katey being right at the forefront of that.”
The level of competition within Team USA mirrors the level of competition the team will face in Sochi. After winning its first Olympic gold in 1998 in Nagano, the U.S. has faltered thrice since, winning silver, bronze, and another silver in the last three games. Meanwhile, Canada, often bolstered by former Stone-coached players like Sarah Vaillancourt ’09, a former ECAC and Ivy League Player of the Year, has swept the top of the podium in Salt Lake City in 2002, in Turin in 2006, and most recently, in Vancouver in 2010.
The team has already had its first glimpse at its Canuck rivals. On October 12, USA inched a step closer to Olympic competition when it played its first of six exhibition games on the Bring on the World Tour and fell to Canada, 3-2.
An Olympic medal and an NCAA title are perhaps the only accolades not yet on Stone’s mantelpiece. Luckily for her, this year does offer a chance to acquire the former.
“I expect to play our absolute best when our best is needed—that’s ultimately the most important thing,” Stone says. “You know, we’re not going to make excuses. We’re there to win a gold medal. We’re not just there to compete, we’re not just there to make a roster or be the coach of the Olympic team; that’s all nice, but there’s a job to do.”
ADDRESSING THE GENDER GAP 
With local and international success to its credit, many wonder why a huge popularity disparity exists between the men’s and women’s hockey programs at Harvard. Last year, the men’s team went 5-7 at home and averaged 2,260 attendees, while the women’s team went 13-1-1 at home and averaged a mere 600. To hear the coaches (and a few players) tell it, the problem is indicative of the status of women’s sports in American society.
“I think it’s a cultural thing,” explains Stone. “People like to watch men’s sports, and in order to expose fans and communities to women’s athletics you need to support them with resources and manpower three to five times more than you would a men’s sport.”
The apathy seems to be endemic. In fact, women’s sports in modern America is partly defined by the idea of not watching—so much so that their perennial unpopularity has become a thing of colloquial humor. As Kate Buesser explains: “People don’t view women’s sports growing up; they don’t really follow it and what’s going on.”
Because one’s particular taste in sports is often familial, passed down from parent to child—which sports and which teams to love—teaching yourself to love a new sport, or an old one played by a different gender, is a mental hurdle that can be difficult to overcome. Many believe that the mass media does little to refocus fans’ attention to women’s sports.
“I think that if you look at any media, including The Crimson, you’ve probably been guilty yourselves of elevating the men’s sports and not so much the women’s sports,” says Kathy Delaney-Smith, head coach of the Harvard women’s basketball team. “When you turn the TV on, when you turn the radio on, when you open the newspaper, when you look online, you’re still seeing 75 to 80 percent men.”
This overarching cultural bias means the sport has to take advantage of every opportunity for exposure. “I think when the Olympics come around it’s the greatest stage for women’s hockey,” explains Stone. “It’s the time, once every four years, that our sport gets tremendous attention, so we want to make sure we capitalize on that.”
Yet while coaches lament a broader inability to appreciate women’s sports, the players, more often than not, point to misconceptions about the roughness of hockey and its misidentification as a so-called masculine sport as specific reasons for the discrepancy in interest.
“Part of the disparity is we don’t hit,” Buesser says.
“But it’s a faster game. The men may have size and strength, but you lose the finesse we have.”
It’s a sentiment echoed by her teammates, who imply that checking spoils the purity of the game.“When you take hitting out,” Fry claims, “it becomes this flow game. You know you’re going to see a lot of great plays, great passes, a lot of speed.”
Despite this lack of checking, the women refuse to cede that it’s a lighter version of the game. “There’s no checking,” Bellamy says, “so people think that it’s not physical, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.”
The perception of women’s hockey as somehow inherently less aggressive (and, the implication is, less interesting) than its male counterpart is a reality the female players try to combat on a regular basis. As Picard explains, “You know, people will say, ‘I’ve never seen a woman’s game before,’ but when they do they’re pleasantly surprised with how physical the game is, even though there’s no hitting. It’s still hockey.”
In a 2012 Crimson article, Picard also emphasized the intensity of women’s hockey. “What I want people to know is that the women’s side is just as worthy as the men’s side,” she said. “It’s the truth. It’s a different game, sure, but it’s a fun game to watch and be a part of.”
But yes, admittedly, there is no checking, an excision that fortunately yields its own reward: a greater focus on the purely athletic aspects of the game. “Because there’s no checking,” explains Bellamy, “it’s a lot more dependent on skill.” She corrects herself, quickly: “I’m not saying we’re better than the men, but without checking we depend more on skill.”
The contact in women’s hockey is not the aesthetically abrasive brand that pops up in men’s hockey. The elegance and complexity of motion are maintained without the graphic interruption of an actual fight, part of why technical virtuosity is of the utmost importance in the women’s game.
Fighting is arguably one of the most inclusive aspects of the men’s game, perhaps because so many viewers can actually envision themselves participating in a fight, rather than hitting a puck. When the players drop their gloves and start swinging at each other, it reduces the divide between athletes and fans, allowing for a more interactive experience.
The endless back-and-forth and the fluidity of the women’s game is immersive in its own way. The commitment the game requires of its viewers—the continuity of attention—might very well be seen as taxing to the lazy fan, but its rewards are all the more satisfying: The skill and effort are even more apparent by virtue of the flow. As Fry explains, “At the Harvard rink—it’s a small building—you’re right up there, you’re close.” She gets excited. “It’s fast, it’s quick, you’re a part of the action.”
One can, therefore, offer ample defenses of the quality of the women’s game, even if the seats remain empty year after year. “It’s unfortunate,” says Picard with a laugh, “that people don’t recognize us. It’s part of being a female athlete, but things are improving. The games are still fun to watch. It doesn’t matter if no one is in the stands, we’re just out there to play.”
Other players brush off the lack of attendees less easily. “For me, this is gonna sound bad,” says Fry, “I wish it was like that [full like the men’s games] for our games, and why shouldn’t it be? We can put the puck in the net too.”
FROM THE SHADOWS
Success in Sochi could contribute to solving the puzzle of popularity for women’s hockey. Players on Team USA, along with Coach Stone and her peers, overwhelmingly feel that the Olympics provide a soapbox for women’s sports, and specifically women’s hockey. Excel on this level, and eyes could turn to the Harvard program.
“It comes down to us playing well,” Pucci says. “I mean, if we’re not playing well, what’s there to watch?”
Playing well certainly worked in 1998, when the United States women took home the top prize from Nagano, and girls’ hockey exploded all over the nation as it never had before.
From 1990-91, when USA Hockey officially created a program for women, and 2009-10, the number of females registered ballooned by 800 percent. Many credit the ’98 U.S. Olympic team, whose success came about in the middle of this timespan, with encouraging such growth. Nearly 70,000 girls and women nationwide participate in official USA Hockey programs; 30 years ago this statistic would have been unimaginable.
As the number of players has skyrocketed, so too has their devotion to the sport.
“The elevation of the commitment from women’s athletes has been really interesting for me personally to watch,” Donato says. “To see even going back to some of my days playing, now watching the women train for the Olympic games and watching our women’s athletes, in particular the women’s hockey team but all the way across the women’s athletics at Harvard, their commitment level is very much in line with the commitment level of their male athletes. And, quite frankly, I’m not so sure that that was the case 20 years ago; but that’s the case now.”
While more women than ever are playing hockey, the crowds watching them remain thin.  However, the Olympics offers a much desired opportunity for more public exposure.
Likely used to that adjustment and the added attention from the public and press is Chu, who has four world championship gold medals, two Olympic silver medals, and one Olympic bronze. Chu has served as captain of both the Harvard and the national teams and was the first Asian American woman to play for the national team. She also attracted national media attention for appearing nude in ESPN Magazine’s Body Issue in October 2011. Beyond setting multiple NCAA records including most points scored, Chu sets herself apart as a leader on the team.
“I first met her when I went to Harvard for my official visit…She made this fantastic batch of puppy chow, which was probably why I chose Harvard,” Buesser says with a laugh. “It’s just amazing to have known her at Harvard, and then to see her still playing, to say, ‘Wow.’ She’s an inspiration to the youth movement. Women’s hockey is growing at a phenomenal pace; she’s a poster child for that. It’s great to learn from her.”
For Chu and the four other current and former Harvard players currently bearing USA across their chests, the Olympics offer a chance to draw the spotlight back to Cambridge and Bright Hockey Arena.
But for people to start paying attention, Team USA needs to win.
Beyond simply attracting a bigger crowd to Bright, the players realize the immense impact they could have on a generation of young girls who are keeping their eyes peeled for NBC’s Olympic coverage. Team USA members hope that the media attention that a gold medal would attract can help them dispel certain stereotypes about female athletes, who some characterize as lacking femininity.
“It’s part of playing on this national team—its part of our job—to go out and show young girls who like any sport that it’s ok to like playing sports,” Picard says. “It’s our job to give these girls someone to look up to, to reverse the idea that hockey and sports in general are more masculine, and to say keep on playing and don’t let it affect you. “
The team faces stark challenges in getting more girls enthusiastic about playing hockey, and more people interested in watching them. In the nine years since Donato has been head coach of the men’s hockey team, his team has had a winning season four times, while Stone’s team has had a winning season every year. And yet student tickets to the men’s Beanpot Tournament are peddled at $16 apiece, while entrance to the women’s equivalent is entirely free, indicative of the relative levels of interest. Perhaps an Olympic medal would turn those tables; but even if not, it would certainly change the status quo.
“I think part of what [Stone] wants to do is make sure they’re not in the shadow of the men’s ice hockey team and that they’re their own entity because it’s a phenomenal level of hockey,” Delaney-Smith says. “I wish we lived in a world that could appreciate it the same.”

In 1964, a truck used to roll through Harvard Yard selling sandwiches. One day, when the truck arrived, a freshman asked the vendor, “But where can I get a beer?” Without hesitation, the driver gave the student the name and number of a “business.” Within 15 minutes, another delivery truck rolled into the Yard with a case of beer, delivering it to his freshman dorm.
In 1964, the legal drinking age in Massachusetts was the same as it is today. “It’s more than the laws that have changed,” says compuer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 as he relates the story above. “It’s the whole culture surrounding the laws.”
Throughout these years, whether a student was 18 or 20 had little impact on his or her ability to obtain alcohol on campus, or to drink at university-affiliated functions. The drinking age would be lowered to 18 in 1973, where it would remain until raised to 20 in 1979, and ultimately 21 in 1984. But in general, alumni say, regardless of the law in practice, rules around drinking were not as intense as they are now. Neither, they add was the drinking itself, particularly compared to today.
James ’76, who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because he did not feel he could speak freely on the record, recalls his house masters serving beer with donuts at their regular events. “Or maybe it was cider and donuts,” he says. “I can’t remember, but if it was beer and donuts, I would have believed that.”James’s hazy recollections are not, as he suggests, simply a measure of the number of years that have passed since his time in Eliot House. Similar gaps in memory persist for many alumni of the time—perhaps illustrating the irrelevance of these changes for many.
Clea Simon ’83, for example, who lived through the rapidly rising drinking age, recalls, “I don’t really feel like it made a difference in my drinking.”
In addition, students like Simon were often unsure whether or not they were “grandfathered” into the new laws. When Simon, for example, was an 18-year-old high school senior, she was able to buy a drink at a bar. But by the time she arrived at Harvard in the fall of 1979, Massachusetts had just raised the drinking age from 18 to 20—meaning she could no longer attend the music clubs that had been a part of her social scene until that point. Still, though, Simon wasn’t entirely certain that she would have been turned away; in general, students were often unsure whether they could maintain their prior legal status, as the drinking age rose faster than their own.
While legal changes were often straightforward, responses on campus were less so. The Yard did not dry up and re-soak overnight. In fact, in the spring of 1981, Lewis’s undergraduate head TF walked into Science Center C in the middle of Lewis’s AM 110 (now CS 51) lecture, wheeling in a keg with a stack of plastic cups. The two proceeded to pour beer and pass it out to the entire class.While clearly not every professor was serving students alcohol in a classroom setting, those that did faced little retribution: Lewis was granted tenure that year.
In fact, there were many regular occasions on which students and faculty might drink together. In the 70s and 80s, a Wednesday evening might play host to what was known as a Master’s Sherry. Not unlike today’s study breaks, as Simon remembers, you’d descend to the masters’ residence to grab something to eat, until, two hours later, you’d realize it was 10 p.m. and time to get back to work. In addition to the usual cheddar, triscuits, or the occasional homemade sherry trifle at Christmastime, though, students were provided with an open bar. Those under 21 were treated no differently than those 21 and over. Because drinking in a family setting was less regulated under the law than in public, House Masters had the capacity to act in loco parentis, or in place of parent figures.
“We learned to drink around our elders,” explains Michael McClung ’83. At Master’s open houses, with their open bars, he admits that there were “absolutely people who took it too far.”
“But the good thing about that,” he continues, “was that it happened in front of everyone. It was all done in the social construct of saying, ‘Wow, don’t be like that guy, that was really embarrassing.’” Among both peers and elders, he remembers not feeling monitored, but rather belonging to part of a community to which he had an affectionate responsibility.
Of course, students drank outside of adult company as well. But even these interactions seem to have had a different dynamic than they do today. James recalls nights at the Delphic club—which he is quick to clarify as having been a “very, very different” kind of place then—with one glass of scotch, a pipe, and a game of backgammon. McClung thinks back to the biweekly parties his blocking group threw senior year on Cabot House’s roof, with nearly 100 kids, 12 kegs, music, and dancing. He claims that no one ever vomitted in the suite or had to be restrained, arrested, or sent to UHS. Neither of the two men recall binge drinking as a regular occurrence.
“I think that we have done our children a disservice by making alcohol something having to be done in secret,” says McClung. “I think instead of teaching kids to drink in moderation responsibly, we teach them to find whatever it is they can, hide, and drink as much as possible quickly before they’re found out.”
As a member of the Harvard community with a different kind of responsibility, Ryan Travia, the director of the Department of Health Promotion & Education and the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, claims that lowering the drinking age today is not the solution to the university’s substance abuse problems. Contrary to the memories and anecdotes of Harvard grads, he explains that research shows little change in binge rates or quantities consumed over the past three decades. According to Travia, comparative studies with European countries—often championed for less rigid, less unhealthy relationships with alcohol—reveal rates of alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and sexual assault to be, in fact, lower in the United States. He explains that Harvard’s philosophy is to treat alcohol as a health issue.
Indeed, in the 30 years since the class of 1983 graduated, institutional support and programming for alcohol-related issues has mushroomed. Some Harvard alumni, though, suggest that the issue is rooted in a deeper, more pervasive campus culture.
“I wonder sometimes,” says James, “if the instantaneousness of social media has actually made kids less able to interact when they’re together. And so the alcohol binge-drinking things helps them overcome that.” Today, even if not every episode of drinking is a heavy one, moderation rarely stands the test of a Friday night after a week of multiple papers, or a dearth of text messages from a crush. And in a rapidly moving academic culture, where students only have limited time allocated for relaxation or connection, it is easy for Harvard students to opt for the most efficient way to blow off steam; there isn’t time to kick back with one glass of scotch, a pipe, and a game of backgammon.
While many factors account for this change, it is difficult to deny the significance of a shift from open, adult-sanctioned alcohol use to what Harvard alumni call a disturbing trend toward alcohol abuse. According to McClung , a recent return to his alma mater, and a first-hand experience of current student social life and drinking, underlined these changes. “The difference was palpable,” he says. “It was not healthy.”

Pulled over on the side of the road in my mom’s minivan, I felt like a more pathetic but less impregnated version of Juno. “Mom, I just can’t do this,” I choked out into my phone, tears streaming down my face.
I had been trying to drive myself to an interview for a summer internship and after a mishap with my GPS, I was now lost, alone, and 20 minutes late. Finally pausing from the constant activity of the preceding string of days, I had my first moment of introspection since that crazy week began. Suddenly, the weight of responsibility washed over me like a wave and left me feeling totally incapable and exhausted. I had no fight left in me. All that kept running through my head was the defeatist mantra, “maybe everyone was right, maybe I’m just not old enough to handle this.” 
A week earlier, I had come home to the sight of a fire truck, an ambulance, and two police cars lining the street in front of my house, their lights in- termittently illuminating the quiet suburban scene with the red glow of alarm. Inside, I found my dad surrounded by five strange, uniformed men. At first, I was comforted by the sight of him, sitting up and coherently answering the questions of the emergency personnel, but when I realized that he couldn’t move his legs, the panic set it.
He was rushed to Mass General Hospital and put into neurological intensive care under the diagnosis of a cerebral aneurysm rupture. I followed the ambulance to the hospital that night, and was able to meet up with my parents in the emergency room. I had never seen my dad look so child-like. He laid still with his teeth chattering on the hospital bed. The smell of his vomit and the sanitizer used to clean it up was overpowering. I put my wool jacket on top of his quivering torso and watched as my mom tried to get him to move his toes. We didn’t know if he would have permanently impaired function. We didn’t know if he would suf- fer memory loss. We didn’t know if he would walk again. As my mother and I were told by the Neurology Resident on call that night, “we’ll just have to wait and see.” 
The next morning I began my life as Junior Mom, doing my best to fill my mom’s role so that she could spend as much time with my dad as pos- sible. The mornings began at 7 a.m. when I would get my four youngest siblings ready for school with the help of my college-age sister. Mid-morning I would drive to Mass General to pick up my mom and drop off a family friend as replacement guard- ian of my dad. The afternoons were filled with chauffeuring my siblings to their various after-school activities. Then there was always dinner to be figured out and homework completion to be overseen. The end of the day was marked by an- other swing by Mass General to return my mom to her nightly post. 
All this was supplemented by the things that weren’t on the schedule, the new responsibilities that this situation had created. I became manager of the volunteer force of friends and neighbors all graciously offering meals and carpools, who looked to me to assess the situation and then schedule and 
assign specific tasks. I had to make a string of difficult phone calls to my dad’s family members to fill them in on what was happening. I felt responsible for looking after my Nonna, my dad’s mother and his only remaining immediate family member, who had moved in with us for the duration of my dad’s stay in the hospital and who was in a state of cynical and despairing shock. 
Since the very first day as a Junior Mom, I was told by nearly every adult I encountered that I was taking on too much. “Can you handle another hour of driving today, Ariana?” “Are you sure that you have dinner under control?” “Be careful that you’re not wearing yourself out.” I heard and dismissed dozens of such questions and statements every day, feeling numb and able to carry on as long as I kept moving. I thought dwelling on the weight of my responsibility would be paralyzing, and I chose to keep distracting myself through doing instead. 
It was not until my mini-van breakdown that I gave any of these warnings any credence. In that moment, I realized I could admit to myself that it was a lot. But that didn’t mean, as all the adults were implying, that it was too much. My respon- sibilities could empower, rather than overwhelm. Yes, it was a lot, but I could do it. Not only that, but I was doing it. 
Letting myself cry allowed me a much-needed release. It only took me about 30 seconds after hanging up to realize this was in fact not the end of the world. This wasn’t defeat, this was a break which left me rejuvenated, not despairing. I was amazed to find that I was able, after a couple deep breaths, to hit the road again, this time arriving at my intended destination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students, scientists, and faculty at Harvard work to decrease the University’s contributions to global climate change and environmental pollution, the Supreme Court recently called into question part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulation of greenhouse gases.
The Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear challenges to the EPA’s regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, specifically questioning whether the agency “permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the Clean Air Act for stationary sources that emit greenhouses gases.”
In 2007, the Supreme Court heard the case, “Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency,” in which it ruled that the EPA was required by law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles if they were found to endanger public health or welfare.
After publishing findings that high concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere were indeed harmful for the public health and welfare, the EPA set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from both new motor vehicles and stationary sources, such as power plants.
State and industry groups challenged the EPA’s regulations, alleging that there was not sufficient evidence to prove greenhouse gases’ harmful effects, that the agency was overstepping its legal authority by regulating stationary sources, and that the regulations themselves were ineffective.
The District of Columbia Circuit of the US Court of Appeals unanimously rejected these challenges, and the Supreme Court has agreed to review this rejection, but only the specific question of whether the EPA is required to regulate, according to Law School Professor Richard J. Lazarus.
“EPA’s ultimate authority here is not truly at stake in this case,” Lazarus said. “The pathway may be a little bit harder. It might take a little bit longer, but the court denied review of issues that could have blocked that pathway, and it granted review of an issue which doesn’t.”
Daniel J. Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering, added that the greenhouse gases that are emitted from a motor vehicle’s tailpipe are the same as those from the smokestacks of a stationary source.
“I’ve seen the EPA be more aggressive about going after power plants than going after cars, and the reason for that is that power plants are more easily controlled,” Jacob said. “They are very large sources with very large budgets. You know exactly what is burned and how efficiently they burn. You can monitor the exhaust gases coming out of the stack. You have a whole lot more control.”
While the societal costs of greenhouse gas emissions are difficult to quantify, Jacob said that the scientific community does not doubt that they increase the frequency of damaging weather disasters.
“You can think of climate change as a deck of cards. You pick a card at random and if it’s the ace of spades you get a hurricane,” Jacob said. “Well, take your deck of cards and remove the deuces and play again. Now you have a greater chance of getting a hurricane.”

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s MOOC Research Initiative has granted HarvardX $21,450 to study how massive open online courses might be made more personalized for individuals in online courses everywhere, HarvardX announced Tuesday.
Led by Sergiy Nesterko, a HarvardX research fellow, and Svetlana I. Dotsenko ’10, founder of startup Project Lever, the study will take self-reported data from those enrolled in HarvardX classes, including country of origin, education level, gender, age, and usage of the course materials. The study will also look at individuals’ learning outcomes and goals.
“We want to...track how those goals manifest themselves in the students’ usage of courses, and ideally would see how those learning goals change over time and come up with a predictive system or a meaningful clustering of students,” Nesterko said in a phone interview.
The study will examine data from 17 HarvardX courses, five of which will have been completed before December 2013.
Selected from 266 original applications, this study is one of 28 projects that will receive funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s MOOC Research Initiative.
Nesterko said that through the study, he and and his team hope “create a recommendation system for students to help understand learning goals better.”
“We want to open ways for researchers to devise better delivery of learning content for students,” he said.
HarvardX courses and MOOCs in general see high attrition rates, many of which Nesterko said can be accounted for by different goals ranging from taking a course for credit to simply hoping to learn more about a particular topic.
“The study could open ways for HarvardX courses to change substantially [because] the delivery and the way it is structured may be more adapted to individual students,” Nesterko said.
Nesterko and Dotsenko said they will make their findings available to MOOC developers and hope the research will provide professors and curriculum development officials with the tools to tailor courses to a wider variety of students.

CLARIFICATION: Oct. 24, 2013
Earlier versions of the headline and URL of this article stated that edX would study personalization in online learning. To clarify, HarvardX, the University’s subset of edX, will conduct the research.

The Harvard Art Museums will add about 300 works of Japanese art to its collections thanks to a gift from retired bio-organic chemistry professor and businessman Robert Feinberg ’61 and his wife Betsy, the Museums announced in a press release on Tuesday.
The donated objects, which include screens, hanging scrolls, and books dating from the 17th century to the early 20th century, will be displayed in different museums in Japan, France, and the United States before coming to Harvard in batches over the next few years. Some of the works are expected to be on permanent display in the newly renovated Fogg Museum at 32 Quincy St when the facility opens in fall 2014.
In addition to donating the Japanese art collection, the couple is also funding one of five new study spaces that will comprise a new Art Study Center at the newly renovated Fogg Museum at 32 Quincy St when the facility opens in fall 2014. The Feinberg-funded study space, which will bear the couple’s last name, will display Asian, ancient, Islamic, and eventually Indian works of art in affiliation with the now-closed Arthur M. Sackler Museum.
Speaking in a phone interview Wednesday evening, Robert Feinberg said he hopes the donated Japanese art pieces appeal to diferent constituencies across the University.
“For some students, it would be the first time they get to see Japanese art,” Feinberg said. “For those who study Japanese, I would like to see Harvard become a strong center for curators and professionals dealing with museums for generations to come.”
Feinberg said that he and Betsy Feinberg’s vast collection of Japanese art had humble beginnings. He said they bought their first piece—a $2 poster of a 16th century screen painting of a Portuguese ship arriving in Japan—while living in a small apartment in New York City in 1972.
“We were fascinated by the portrayal of the Portuguese people and their ships in the middle of the 16th century, so we bought it,” Feinberg said. “Over time, we just added more and more.”
When asked which of the many donated works was his favorite, Feinberg demured.
“We probably say a different answer depending on our mood,” he said, though he added he and Betsy Feinberg currently favor “Grasses and Moon,” a 19th century hanging scroll by Tani Bunchō, and “Cranes,” a 19th century two-panel screen by Suzuki Kiitsu.

A study by Harvard researchers found that nitrogen-based compounds are negatively affecting the ecosystems of U.S. National Parks, and that there is no existing policy to curtail this trend, The paper concludes that nitrogen deposition is a serious problem for ecosystems in the U.S., and in particular for national parks that are supposed to be maintained in their pristine state.
According to co-author Daniel J. Jacob, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and environmental engineering, the paper’s principal discovery is that “a major contribution to this nitrogen deposition comes from agriculture, which emits ammonia and in its present state is totally unregulated in the United States,” he said.
The paper cites power plants, automobile exhaust, and industrial agriculture as the foremost means of disrupting the ecosystems, particularly their soil nutrient concentrations, algal growth, and aquatic pH levels.
While the paper focuses on the magnitude of the adverse effects of nitrogen deposition in the U.S., Jacob added that the issue is a global one.
“The Europeans have a much worse problem than we do, but they’ve been acting on it,” Jacob said. “They have strong controls on ammonia emissions. It’s a tremendous problem in India, China, and in places like Brazil with a lot of cattle.”
Co-author Raluca Ellis, a former postdoctoral fellow in environmental science and engineering, addressed the research’s policy implications.
“This work suggests that to keep our National Parks unchanged, as is mandated by law, we need to reduce our emission of nitrogen-based compounds (nitrogen oxides and ammonia),” Ellis wrote in an email to The Crimson.
One obstacle to this political goal is that ammonia emissions have never been regulated in the past. While the two main processes by which ammonia is emitted--the application of fertilizer and the use of manure--have been unregulated in the U.S., they have been increasingly and successfully regulated in Europe.
The main reason that ammonia regulations have been nonexistent is that the Environmental Protection Agency regulates environmental activity based on public health concerns. While ammonia has some impacts on public health, Jacob said that “they are slightly muted. It’s more questionable to control just on public health concerns, whereas the effects on ecosystems are obvious.”
Reduction does not have to be publicly mandated. Some farms are beginning to limit ammonia emissions, and better farming practices and technology are other means of ammonia reduction.

Got a sore throat? Your doctor might prescribe you antibiotics. They help right? According to a new Harvard study, the answer is not always.
According to new research from Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, though only 10 percent of adults with sore throat have group A Streptococcus, or strep throat—the only cause of sore throat that antibiotics can cure—doctors prescribe antibiotics at 60 percent of sore throat visits. Despite decades of effort by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention to cut down on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing, the rate has dropped only incrementally.
Jeffrey A. Linder, associate professor of medicine at HMS and co-author of the paper, described four common symptoms of strep throat: fever, absence of cough, tender neck glands, and swollen tonsils. Most sore throat patients show either none or just one of these symptoms, meaning that they can be treated with Tylenol and fluids and without a doctor’s visit.
Antibiotics, which target bacteria, have no positive effect on treating viral sore throats and acute bronchitis, which account for the majority of sore throat cases, according to co-author Michael L. Barnett, medical resident in internal medicine at Brigham and Women’s. In fact, antibiotics aren’t harmless; unnecessary prescription may lead to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
“You’re taking a medicine that has no chance of helping you, and has a very real chance of hurting you,” said Linder, physician in the Division of General Medicine and Primary Care at Brigmham and Women’s.
The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine on October 3, examined a sample of 8191 sore throat visits between 1997 and 2010, representing 92 million adult sore throat visits to primary care or emergency departments in the U.S. Research showed that sore throat visits decreased from 7.5 percent of primary care visits in 1997 to 4.3 percent in 2010.
However, the overall national antibiotic prescribing rate remained constant, as physicians continued to prescribe antibiotics at 60 percent of visits. This might be explained by habit—that doctors assume patients want antibiotics, or diagnostic uncertainty—according to Linder.
The authors of the study highlighted that though penicillin remains the most effective antibiotic for treating strep throat, it was only prescribed at 9  percent of visits. Instead, the prescription of more expensive antibiotics such as azithromycin, to which bacteria are sometimes resistant, increased from under 5 percent to 15 percent of sore throat visits.
According to the study, the cost of prescribing unnecessary antibiotics from 1997 to 2010 was conservatively $500 billion. The antibiotic prescription rate dropped from 80 percent to 70 percent around 1993, and has since plateaued at 60 percent of visits.
“This reflects the slow shift to focusing on how we can address the low-hanging fruit of overuse in medical care,” Barnett said.

Recently published results from the Harvard Stem Cell Institute’s first-ever clinical trials have identified a molecule that could increase the success rates of umbilical cord blood transplants in cancer patients.
The trials found that umbilical cord blood cells treated with 16, 16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, a molecule derived from fatty acids and also called dmPGE2, grew more stem cells than untreated umbilical cord blood.
Stem cell growth is particularly promising in the treatment of cancer, which is marked by rapid proliferation of mutated cells and the death of functional, important tissue. Stem cell transplants usually face stringent blood type matching requirements, which can often hinder a patient’s ability to find a viable donor.
Umbilical cord transplants improve flexibility and safety, however, since blood does not need to be exactly matched and has had less exposure to viruses. Successful implementation of the dmPGE2 molecule could help the approximately 50 to 60 percent of stem cell transplant patients who do not have siblings with a matching blood type.
Led by Leonard I. Zon, chairman of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute Executive Committee and professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, researchers at the HSCI discovered that dmPGE2 spurred stem cell growth through laboratory experiments on zebrafish and then mice. Zon and his team then approached the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital to conduct clinical trials.
The HSCI has several ongoing projects, but researchers’ work on the dmPGE2 molecule is “one of the special projects in the lab,” Zon said, adding that the work is “one of the most exciting things” he has ever done.
Corey S. Cutler, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who spearheaded the clinical trials, echoed Zon’s enthusiasm about the project’s potential. “The exciting part [about this project] is that it’s really home-grown technology that was discovered right down the hall,” he said. He added that while it may still be many years before the technology is ubiquitously accessible to patients, “the fact that we could potentially change the field entirely; it’s quite amazing.”
The study was published online in the weekly medical journal Blood in late August and received support from biopharmaceutical company Fate Therapeutics. Phase II of the clinical testing is designed to evaluate the treatment’s efficacy in about 60 patients. According to Zon, results should be expected after 18 months.
The HSCI was established nine years ago to translate stem cell technology advances made in the laboratory into clinical applications.

Harvard University Professor Cass R. Sunstein ’75 and Richard H. Thaler, a professor of behavioral science at the University of Chicago, told a crowded auditorium on Wednesday evening that even small changes, such as shifting the layout of a cafeteria, can have large-scale impacts, such as reducing the risk of obesity in children.
At an event hosted by the John F. Kennedy Forum, Sunstein and Thaler discussed the concept of “libertarian paternalism,” a theory in behavioral economics that the presentation and transparency of information can “nudge” individuals toward making certain decisions while still ultimately allowing freedom of choice.
Sunstein and Thaler previously explored the issue of “libertarian paternalism” in their co-authored book, “Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wellness, and Happiness.”
One example Thaler noted was the replacement of the food pyramid with the food plate. The illustration of the plate, Thaler asserted, makes the diagram easier to understand and therefore encourages healthier eating habits without actively restricting what people can consume.
Both Thaler and Sunstein admitted that their work on the theory of nudging has attracted criticism.
Sunstein said that the study and implementation of behavioral economic theories—like nudging—used to be viewed favorably in Washington, but has attracted concern. Sunstein said that he thinks this transition in attitude occurred because people believe  that nudging removes choice.
Sunstein and Thaler defended their research, saying that the study and experimentation with behavioral economics can lead to policy changes that prompt individuals to make better and more cost-efficient choices for themselves.
“The deep understanding is that if you make something easier people are more likely to do it ... and that price is not the only thing that matters,” Thaler said. He also said that the principles used in his research did not require a “deep understanding” of social sciences.
Thaler acknowledged, however, that experiments with nudging do not always translate into results in the real world.
“Not every exciting finding that gets reported will be replicated around the world,” he said. “Some stuff just won’t replicate at all.”

William J. “Bill” Baxley, the former Attorney General of Alabama, spoke at Kirkland House on his role in prosecuting one of the men involved with the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing—a moment often thought of as a turning point in the civil rights movement.
Baxley grew up in Alabama during an era in which segregation was forceful and prevalent. Though others around him had differing views, Baxley said, “[ I ] always, for as long as I can remember, thought that the way people were treated in the South was wrong.”
As a young adult, Baxley watched violence escalate during the civil rights movement—Theophilus E. “Bull” Connor violently targeted the Freedom Riders and frequent bombings occurred against civil rights leaders.
“It’s like a different planet [now] from the way it was back then,” said Baxley. “Birmingham had gotten the name Bombingham.”
The bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church on September 15, 1963 had a particularly strong impact on him, he said. Four young girls died as a result, while one survived with major trauma, including partial blindness.
“I got almost physically ill, and later that day I made a vow to myself that I would do something about it,” said Baxley of the day of the bombing.
Six years later, Baxley became the Attorney General of Alabama and had the authority to reopen the unresolved case of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
Baxley described a series of challenges associated with reopening the case. The files from the original police investigation “were mostly worthless,” and the FBI was also initially reluctant to cooperate with the re-opened investigation, he said.
Baxley said that the turning point in the case came when located a key witness. The woman was able to identify a car parked by the church right before the bombing, and a main suspect in the case, Robert Chambliss.
Towards the end of the event, Baxley shared a moment from the final day of the trial of Chambliss. It was the birthday of one of the victims, Denise McNair.
Baxley said that he emphasized this in his closing statement to the jurors, saying, “You twelve have an opportunity to do something no one else can do. You have the opportunity to give her a birthday present.”

The sound of an airplane soaring overhead is familiar to many Americans. However, results of a new study by a team of professors from the Harvard School of Public Health and the Boston University School of Public Health tentatively suggest that, for the just over 6 million elderly Americans who live in close proximity to airports, the constant presence of noises associated with airplanes may be detrimental to cardiovascular health.
The authors of the study found a 3.5 percent higher hospital admission rate due to cardiovascular problems in the elderly who hailed from zip codes near airports that consistently experienced noise levels 10 decibels higher than average.
The study—inspired in part by previous research that suggested an association between aircraft noise and certain physiological reactions—was commissioned by the Partnership for Air Transportation Noise and Emissions Reduction, a poly-university cooperative research organization sponsored in part by the Federal Avivation Administration and NASA that is aimed at investigating and finding solutions for noise and emissions problems related to aviation.
The researchers analyzed 2218 zip codes in near proximity to 89 major U.S. airports and controlled for socioeconomic status, air pollution, proximity to a “roadway” and demographic factors such as age, race, and sex. Additionally, subjects in the study were all over age 65 and eligible to participate in Medicare.
HSPH professor Francesca Dominici, a co-author of the study, said that its findings are particularly significant because it reflects data from all over the continental U.S.  Furthermore, she said the findings have broader implications given that cardiovascular issues are the leading cause of death worldwide.
However, Dominici also acknowledged the large prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the population makes it difficult to isolate aircraft noise as the primary cause of cardiovascular issues in the subjects.
Still, because of the statistical significance of their findings, Dominici suggested that action should be taken to minimize the negative effects of aviation-related noise and emissions in the future.
In a press release from HSPH, study co-author Jonathan Levy, a professor at BUSPH and an adjunct professor at HSPH, proposed a variety of options to minimize aviation-related noise exposure, including improving flightpaths, using runways strategically, and soundproofing nearby homes and buildings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part II of a three-part series on the search for a new Dean of the College. Part I ran on Oct. 16 and Part III ran on Oct. 18.
Last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith led a lively discussion in Lowell House about Harvard’s ongoing search for a new leader of its flagship school.
Flanked by six members of the advisory committee he convened in September to assist him with the process of picking a new College Dean, Smith took questions from an audience of about 25 students.
“This is extremely important from our perspective to get out and hear from students about what you’re thinking,” he told the students before beginning a discussion that lasted about 75 minutes and touched on topics ranging from final clubs to the experience of students living in the Quad.
In both the current search and his 2007-2008 search for his first College Dean pick, Evelynn M. Hammonds, Smith has publicly sought to put student engagement and the work of advisory committees at the center of the search process.
While historically there has been no one-size-fits-all process to selecting the College Dean, Smith’s consultative approach represents a significant tactical shift from that of his predecessors, some of whom were criticized for not attempting a broad consultation with the Harvard community when making their appointments.
Yet in other aspects of the College Dean search, Smith has followed historical precedent. In the 2007-2008 search, Smith continued a legacy that has seen FAS deans use their near-singular authority to majorly influence the structure of the College administration during the turnover of its leader. Today, it remains to be seen if he will do so again.
THE FINAL SAY
 When then-FAS Dean A. Michael Spence set out to replace Dean of the College John B. Fox Jr. ’59 in 1985, he appointed an advisory committee to help him with the work. He delegated to the committee the early groundwork of the search, including the preliminary interviewing of applicants and the reading of applications.
 
But Spence took over later in the process, interviewing the finalists on his own, according to a 1985 Crimson article, and eventually selected L. Fred Jewett ’57.
“My recollection is that it was a more informal consultative process, thorough, but not a full search committee,” Spence wrote in an email to The Crimson last week.
Spence was not alone in making the appointment a primarily executive decision.
Former FAS Dean William C. Kirby also favored a more internal approach to College Dean searches when he made his selection in 2003. Although a committee was established to evaluate new responsibilities for the Dean of the College, Kirby appointed the new College Dean, then-Dean of Undergraduate Education Benedict H. Gross ’71, before the committee ever met.
Gross, who now heads the Department of Mathematics, remembered a brief search process, with little consultation of the community at large—a contrast to what he has observed in Smith’s searches.
“Mike [Smith is] conducting a very elaborate process,” Gross said in an interview last month. “When I was appointed, I think Bill Kirby just thought about it for a few weeks, called people in for interviews, and asked me if I wanted to do it.”
After Kirby was criticized for his lack of broad consultation before he appointed Gross in 2003, Smith in 2008 convened two search committees—an eight-member faculty committee and a 31-member panel of students from across the College—to advise him before he ultimately chose Hammonds. This year, after Hammonds’s July departure, Smith has leaned on a 21-member faculty advisory committee and scheduled three open student forums across campus, including one Thursday evening in Pforzheimer House.
"I believe that these meetings have been extremely helpful and quite productive,” Smith said in a statement to The Crimson. “The committee members and I greatly appreciate the time and honest opinions of the undergraduates. I hope the students feel that these have been successful opportunities for them to voice their ideas and experiences."
Yet Gross said that the final decision about the College Dean ultimately rests with the FAS Dean, and that, in his view, the influence of search committees is limited.
“[The committee] will sort through recommendations and come up with a short list, but ultimately [the appointment] is Mike Smith’s decision,” Gross said.
SHIFTING RESPONSIBILITIES
In choosing a new College Dean, some FAS deans have not just made a hire but also shaped the character of the College deanship by shuffling leadership positions within the College administration.
In selecting Gross in 2003, Kirby completed a significant restructuring of the College administration by eliminating the position of Dean of Undergraduate Education, which had been held by Gross.
As Dean of Undergraduate Education, Gross had in 2002 helped launch a curricular review that sought to internally evaluate Harvard’s academic program. Kirby said in an interview earlier this month that, by merging the two deanships and concentrating academic control in Gross, he aimed to strengthen the role of the College Dean in the curricular review.
Kirby’s decision had significant effects on not just the role of the College Dean but also the student experience in the classroom. The curricular review, which ran from 2002 to 2007, dominated Gross’s deanship. It eventually produced the General Education program, which replaced the Core as the College’s structure for distribution requirements.
CRAFTING AN ATMOSPHERE
Smith too has used his broad authority as FAS Dean to shape the influence of the College administration, but he has done so by embracing a model of thorough faculty and student consultation and completing an effective reversal of Kirby’s restructuring.
After Gross stepped down as College Dean in 2007, Smith opted to revitalize the position of Dean of Undergraduate Education, appointing Jewish studies professor Jay M. Harris in 2008. Smith has explained the move by contending that the Dean of the College should not supervise too wide a range of activities. He has given no indication that he has plans to make further changes to the administrative structure of the College this time around.
Musing on the model in which the College Dean also oversees undergraduate education, Smith said at the Lowell forum last week that he thinks “there is a lot to be said for somebody that is thinking about undergraduates in the entirety.”
But, he added, “dealing with all the issues in your academic life and all the issues in your extracurricular life, that’s too big a job for one person.”

The Harvard football team may have a tradition of producing great quarterbacks, but it also seems to have a knack for developing solid backups as well.
When quarterback Collier Winters got sidelined after the first week of the 2011 season with a hamstring injury, second-string Colton Chapple came in and led the team to three straight victories while Winters recovered.
Starting quarterback junior Conner Hempel left in the first quarter of Week Three’s contest with a hyperextended knee but came back in to lead the team to a triple-overtime win over Holy Cross. But a week later, with the team slated to face Cornell on the road, the injury was still bothering him.
“If you watched him in the last drive and in overtime, he looked fine. But obviously there was a lot of adrenaline, and the next day, he didn’t feel quite as well,” coach Tim Murphy said.
Enter senior Michael Pruneau. After a shaky first drive that ended in an interception, Pruneau settled into the starting spot like a veteran, completing 23 of 29 passes for 340 yards and two scores to lead Harvard to a 34-24 victory over the Big Red.
“Any really solid program is going to have depth at the quarterback position,” Murphy said. “You’re not going to be a solid program consistently over the years if you don’t have a legitimate backup, and I think, if anything, in our 20 years here, we’ve done a good job evaluating, developing, and recruiting quality quarterbacks.”
Pruneau, who suffered an ACL tear in last year’s preseason, competed with Hempel for the starting position in a tight battle that ended in Hempel narrowly edging out the senior for the job.
“The decision to start Conner wasn’t an easy one. It pretty much did go right down to the wire,” Murphy said. “We feel like we can win with either quarterback, and now we’re in a position to verify that, so we’re extremely fortunate to have a senior who is clearly a good football player. We’re in good shape at quarterback.”
Murphy says Hempel is at “about 85 percent” right now, so with the non-conference game this weekend and the conservative approach the team is taking with Hempel’s health, Pruneau will likely lead the offense again on Saturday against Lafayette.
“I don’t think of myself as the backup quarterback,” Pruneau said. “I’ve been prepared for this forever. The injury obviously set me back, but all of my hard work is kind of coming out, and it’s good to see that.”

The Harvard men’s water polo team pulled through in a hard fought road battle last night to clinch its seventh straight win. The Crimson (10-8, 8-1 CWPA Northern) was triumphant for the second time this season against its cross-town rival MIT (6-10, 6-6 CWPA Northern) in a 10-7 victory at Alumni Pool.
The Harvard offense started the game off strong with four goals in both the first and second quarters. Once again, the team’s underclassmen were crucial to another Crimson victory.
Familiar faces attributed to Harvard’s offensive success. Sophomore Noah Harrison, the leading goal scorer for the Crimson this season with a total of 35 goals, led the team with three scores on the night. In addition to Harrison’s goals, five other Crimson players found the back of the net, including rookie teammate Joey Colton. Colton, ranked second in total assists for Harvard this season, chipped in two goals and totaled three assists.
Despite a strong start, the Crimson lost its large 8-2 lead early on in the second half of play.
“We came out looking really good,” sophomore Colin Woolway said. “After that, our offense settled down a little bit, and we lost a lot of momentum.”
The Engineers outscored Harvard in the third quarter, 3-1, and the Engineers held the Crimson offense to only two goals in the third and fourth periods.
Despite a poorer showing in the second half, senior captain Jimmy Field was pleased with the performance.
“It was a good game for us,” Field said. “As it got close, it forced us to dig deep and fight for the last two quarters. We can’t give up in the first place, and we need to work hard to protect the lead. [This game] showed we are capable of doing that.”
MIT underclassmen also played a huge role in the Engineers’ near-comeback. Sophomore Ory Tasman scored three goals for his team, while freshmen keepers Nolan Kruse and Ian Zune tended the net for the entirety of the game, together earning 13 blocks.
The defensive game has been and continued to be crucial for Harvard. In the six wins leading up to last night’s game, the Crimson allowed only 8.5 goals per contest. The team also recorded 75 total steals and 45 saves.
Despite a weaker offensive showing in the second half, the defense once again managed to play at a high level, contributing greatly to the win.
“It wasn’t a big deal that our offense wasn’t producing because our defense was keeping the lead. We were able to rely on that,” Woolway said.
The Crimson’s defense was able to keep the aggressive Engineers at bay; in the final quarter of play, MIT found the back of the net only once. Woolway was critical to the defensive game. The three-time CWPA Defensive Player of the Week winner tallied a total of nine saves in goal.
“We are working a lot harder on pressing hard…and making it harder for the other team to control the ball,” Woolway said.  “We have a lot of long guys on the perimeter who are able to steal the ball.”
The strong back line, which ended the night with a total of six steals—two from Harrison and rookie Dan Stevens—was able to keep the Harvard lead to at least two goals for the majority of the game.
“We have been trying to increase our communication on defense,” Field said. “[This] showed in the game.”
With the team’s season nearly halfway over, the Crimson is ranked for the first time since 2002 thanks to numerous strong showings. Harvard currently sits at No. 17 in the water polo national rankings.
“We weren’t on the radar as much last year, so it definitely feels good to be in the national conversation,” Woolway said. “We have a bit of a target on our back now, but that was our goal.”
The team will be traveling to New Haven on Saturday to compete in the Ivy Championships, where its ranking will be put on the line.
“[Being ranked] feels good,” Field said. “It’s motivation because now we have something to protect. We go out in the water wanting to play every game without a slip-up. We have to continue working hard.”

At Harvard, it’s pretty easy to lose track of when you last slept, showered, or ate. In an ideal world, you would wake up from a nap at Lamont and make the big realization, “That’s it, I’m done! I’m going to actually take care of myself!” though it’s more likely that you’ll just head to the café for another coffee and a cookie. Here are some tips for your life as an adult (or an almost-adult; we’re more like large babies).
 
1. Plan for the future
 DO attend info sessions for summer internships and recruiting events, even if it's just for the free food. Hatch a plan for getting into that class you’ve lotteried out of at least twice—kidnap Maria Tatar if necessary. Go to the gym in preparation for Primal Scream, hit on as many people as possible in hopes of one day “doing it” in the Widener stacks, and stock up on water before going out so that you’ll be able to relieve yourself on John Harvard’s foot. If you're going to score a job from one of the many recruiting events you attend, you may as well have a little fun until it starts!
 
2. Stay hydrated
No, beer doesn't count. It is recommended that you drink eight cups of water a day. Coffee doesn’t count either. Your body is a temple, etc.
 
3. Don’t wear pajamas everyday
But don’t wear a suit or a dress everyday either; you might be wearing that for the rest of your life (aargh). On a similar note, please do laundry at least once every two weeks (or until you run out of underwear). Smell nice, keep the wrinkles at a minimum, and stay comfortable.
 
4. Manage your finances
As you hand your HUID over at Greenhouse Café and say “Board plus,” take a moment to think about what you’re doing. The University has given you $60 of play money for the semester. Think of all you could do with that. You could buy nine rolls of sushi at Lamont, 12 packs of condoms from the vending machine (to be used in the Widener stacks of course), or you could save it all for finals and avoid the dining hall for an entire week. Economize, people.
 
5. Create a routine
Even if it includes spending from 11 p.m. – 7 a.m. in Lamont, heading to class, eating a meal, and then doing it all over again, at least it’s consistent. Factor in a shower though, and time to brush your teeth.
 
6. PYOT
Put yo’self out there. Maybe you're looking to join a new club, or perhaps you'd like to use this time to find your mate (we won't judge). You only have four years at Harvard, which means you have four years to do this. Skip over those awkward interactions at parties and prioritize. Admissions counselors here basically sub as matchmakers, so when they were going through your application, they also found your significant other for you. When you were seventeen, you wrote your college essay on the time you went skydiving in Antarctica, and naturally they paired you with the one other person in your class who went skydiving in Antarctica. Sneak into the office, steal your file, and stalk your soulmate on Facebook. Try not to scare him or her away with your stalking abilities.

Amazing things are happening at Harvard every day. Our chemistry professors are casually winning Nobel Prizes. Malala Yousafzai came to speak last month in support of women’s education. Celebrities are regularly visiting campus. Recently, we were graced by the presence of none other than the YouTube sensation Da’Quan. A University of Michigan alum whose real name is Lucas Brody, Da'Quan now travels around the country making mischief and wreaking havoc on college campuses.
What ensued on our campus is nothing short of amazing. Watch with friends and get ready to cry from laughter.
(No word on how he was able to enter Lamont or the Science Center and cause such disruption. Security guards we tried to interview were not able to comment on these incidents.)
