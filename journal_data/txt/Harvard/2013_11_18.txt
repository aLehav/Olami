While the term "fine art" typically conjures up images of oil canvases and watercolors from centuries past, the Museum of Fine Art opened an exhibit on Tuesday that showcases how media like bamboo and ceramics, less commonly associated with fine art, can be used to create captivating works of contemporary art. "Fired Earth, Woven Bamboo," which is on display through Sept. 8, 2014, contains 60 works of decorative art drawn from a recent donation of over 90 works to the MFA by collectors Mary Ann and Stanley Snider. The exhibit successfully drew attention to the contemporary harmony between traditional bamboo and ceramic art forms and the way they were used by modern artists for their own goals. While historically the primary purpose of decorative household ceramics and bamboo objects was functional, in the late 19th century this purpose shifted toward an emphasis on aesthetics and the materials’ expressive possibilities. The exhibit contains an impressive collection of pieces that embody this transformation. It also allows visitors to appreciate contemporary trends for themselves.
One of the strengths of the exhibition is its breadth of content; the works span the late 19th to early 21st centuries. The exhibition is also broad in the types of works that it displays, including some that are clearly rooted in traditional form and some that are influenced by post-modern rejections of established convention. One demonstration of the change of style across time is the presence of both a vase dating from the 1930-40s by Kawai Kanjiro and the 2010 work "Untitled MV-1019" by Akiyama Yo. While Kanjiro’s work, a hexagonal pedestal vase, maintains a functional capacity as a vessel, Yo’s work is ill-suited to serve the functional purpose of holding liquid. On an aesthetic level, Kanjiro’s vase boasts a seamless scroll pattern and neat appearance, while Yo’s piece is made to appear intentionally distressed and weathered. Another change shown in the collection is the increasing opportunities for women to work as artists in the traditionally male-dominated craft form of ceramics, as seen in the inclusion of works by emerging female sculptor Sakurai Yasuko and female ceramicist Kishi Eiko.
The exhibition also effectively conveys an accessible and informative history of the developments in decorative art over the past century. All of the works in the show have been made by artists based in Japan. The 20th century was a time of changing artistic sensibilities in the field of Japanese ceramics.
The exhibit illustrates the radical departures from centuries-established stylistic forms and the opening of artistic doors to creators who had previously been excluded from the field. Although contemporary ceramics and bamboo pieces coming out of Japan have a different look and feel than their more familiar traditional counterparts, they nevertheless require great skill in their creation. While many exhibitions provide accompanying wall text to support the works on display, "Fired Earth, Woven Bamboo" does an especially good job of guiding the viewer through the significance of the works on display.
The descriptive labels explain the procedural details of construction in a particularly engaging manner. Visitors to the exhibition can learn from labels placed near certain pieces about the planning and execution required to make them. A label next to his work describes how bamboo artist Honma Hideaki produces dozens of plenary sketches of a bamboo sculpture before starting the work. The exhibition also contains a video installation showing clips of both ceramicist Kishi Eiko and bamboo artist Nagakura Kenichi at work. Both of these artists have works in the exhibition, and the video allows people to witness their meticulous creative processes in action.
The diversity of the works is by showing the interesting effects that can be achieved by manipulating these traditional media. Traditional bamboo creations typically involve strands of bamboo woven together to create a solid structure, but Yamaguchi Ryuun’s "Fire" ingeniously leaves multiple strands of bamboo unbound in order to give the bamboo the appearance of a flickering flame. This and other works in the exhibition show how divergence from longstanding techniques can be used to create unique and captivating effects.
In a museum full of works dating back centuries, "Fired Earth, Woven Bamboo" stands out as a display of the innovative potential of modern approaches to traditional art materials. While exhibitions of this genre can sometimes seem overly esoteric to the average viewer, this show does exceptionally at presenting its subject matter in an engaging way.

 Sometimes overshadowed by Harvard’s better-known, large musical ensembles, the university’s smaller groups provide edifying supplements to the generally excellent but often predictable programs of the main concert groups. One such ensemble is the conductorless Brattle Street Chamber Players, which held its annual fall concert on Friday, Nov. 8. This 14-member, medium-sized string group is committed to playing rarely performed pieces and new compositions. On Friday, the group performed pieces by Antonio Vivaldi and Béla Bartók, as well as an original composition by one of their members, with a playful attitude and technical skill. They brought vigor and style to a program that was relatively brief but of which the coherence and excellence in execution carried the day. 
 The program began with Vivaldi’s Concerto Grosso in D minor, Opus 3, No. 11. Performances of baroque chamber works—even well-known ones—by the larger, better-known musical groups on campus are relatively unusual, because these pieces are not composed with orchestral performances in mind. It is refreshing to see one appear in the program, especially performed at such a high level. The performance was generally crisp, with an outstanding performance by cello soloist Mariel A. Werner ’16, whose command of the piece’s technically difficult passages was flawless, allowing her to bring a real and unforced expressiveness to her interpretation.
 The Vivaldi piece provided a thematic introduction for the highlight of the program, the premiere of an original composition by violist George A. Meyer ’15 simply titled “Concerto Grosso.” This work, featuring Meyer himself as a viola soloist, displayed much skill in its composition. Several passages were incredibly stirring: there was a noticeable murmur in the audience after the first haunting phrases of the work. Some of the intervening material, however, although technically flawless, felt somewhat mechanical; nevertheless, it was on the whole a masterful composition. This piece clearly brought forth the greatest enthusiasm from the ensemble, whose handling of the piece was immaculate and whose dynamic range made for a powerful experience. 
 The dissonance of “Concerto Grosso” led naturally into Bartók’s “Divertimento for String Orchestra,” another string-ensemble favorite that does not receive much attention from the larger campus groups. The decision to put this as the third and final piece in the program is a great credit to the concert’s directors and arguably the greatest example of this concert’s highly skilled organization, as the “Divertimento” transitioned from the high tension of “Concerto Grosso” to a relaxed, satisfying resolution for the program. While a technical success, the performance of the piece was relatively unremarkable following the vigor of Meyer’s piece. Regardless, Alan M. Toda-Ambaras ’13, who is finishing his final year in the Harvard-NEC dual degree program at the New England Conservatory, gave a particularly noteworthy performance on cello, bringing an understated elegance and sensitivity to the work.
 While large musical ensembles like the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra get the most attention on campus, the high quality found in the performances given by smaller groups testifies to Harvard’s large pool of musical talent. Concertgoers who neglect these groups run the risk of missing many moving, professional-quality performances. The Brattle Street Chamber Players’ Fall Concert illustrated this fact with strength and panache, both through the excellence of the contents’ coordination and the quality of musical skill presented.

Once in a generation, a rare book will arise above the shoulders of its contemporaries, a book chosen from inception to be in a dark world a shining beacon of all that is loathsome in the aesthetics of the American bourgeoisie. All nations stand agape before it, astonished that any entity can be such a paragon of triteness. They bow down before its insensate mass, hoping to be spared the spiritual emptiness that enters into all that it touches; but like a sphinx or some ancient chthonic deity, with monstrous indifference it continues on its way, afflicting all it passes with cultural blight and gangrene of the soul. “Stella Bain” is that book. Anita Shreve is purportedly its author, but this title is too humble for her. She is a prophetess, a vessel through which the utterances of the dark gods of mediocrity are conveyed to a helpless humanity. It is impossible that “Stella Bain” is a work of human origin; its trashy perfection is attributable only to a divine architect. The creationists must be right after all, except in this: their higher power is benevolent, whereas “Stella Bain” is not the work of any being that has the best interests of man at heart.
It is difficult to distinguish the worst aspect of this work, but it is expedient to begin with its plot, which is so far-fetched as to be laughable. In the midst of World War I, a woman wakes in a French field hospital with almost total amnesia, a medical condition of such rarity that it strains the reader’s suspension of disbelief from the very first page. This fact would be bearable, if it were not also coupled with the ludicrous circumstance that she remembers how to drive an ambulance, a somewhat unusual skill for a woman in 1916. This fact is presented with little wonder and without any irony or humor. The only character who expresses any reasonable incredulity is the English nun running the ward in which the woman awakes, but she is soon dissolved into the irrationality enveloping the other characters. The woman’s mysterious ambulance-driving skills are accepted at face value for the rest of the book.
The woman decides that her name is Stella Bain for no apparent reason and suddenly is discovered to be such a talented portraitist that all the orderlies request drawings. Needless to say, this occurrence is conveniently timed so that within two pages Stella has made enough money to pay for passage to London. She feels that she must seek out the Admiralty for no good reason besides some obscure internal impulse piercing through the confusion. In London, the intrepid amnesiac-ambulance-driver-portraitist is taken in by a surgeon who, in a set of the most agonizing scenes in the book, practices pop-psychology talk therapy on her. The rest of the plot cannot be conveyed without spoilers, but it contains such cartoonish figures as an evil husband, an obnoxious custody lawyer, innocent and helpless children, and a noble, sensitive, aesthetically aware, tennis-playing conscientious objector ambulance driver. As is the case everywhere else, they are all presented as completely serious characters in spite of the fact that their proper context be would a Lemony Snicket novel.
If “Stella Bain” had a redeeming prose style, perhaps some of its contents’ fatuousness could be excused. However, Shreve displays a true mastery of the whole spectrum of awkwardness in the English language. The main narrative is given in the historical present, an annoying modern stylistic tic. This jarring tense is punctuated by bizarre efforts at profundity and cleverness. For example, in the description of field-hospital work: “The surgeon’s job is beyond belief, a hell on earth worse than any hell imagined.” As if the sentence were not already a stylistic cripple from the trite modifier “beyond belief,” Shreve mercilessly finishes it off with the lamest comparison that comes to hand. Shreve also has latched onto the idea that ending chapters mid-thought is clever and attractive. A sample: “She moves forward until she can walk no more, but still she keeps trudging. She walks until she comes to a stop against a wrought-iron fence. A woman in a rose-colored suit asks her a question.” Then the chapter ends. This technique does not produce a cliffhanger effect, but irritates. Similarly, Shreve has tremendous control over awkward litotes: “Dr. Bridge is not an unhandsome man, and she puts him in his late thirties.” There are other tics that one could mention, but from the few presented it is clear that “Stella Bain” may be the clunkiest book published not only in 2013, but also in the past decade.
Two choice examples speak for the considerable problems with Shreve’s dialogue. During Stella’s talk therapy: “‘Who is with you in the garden?’ ‘No one,’ she says. ‘Well, maybe someone else is there, below eye level—a gardener, perhaps, but I can’t see who it is. But… oh… it’s going. The garden is going….’ She reaches out a hand as if she could pull it back. She looks up at Dr. Bridge. ‘How did that happen? Where has it gone?’” Rather than conveying vividness, the ellipses merely convey the impression that Shreve cannot control dialogue rhythm and the reader’s visualization of the scene without relying on punctuation to do her work. Worse, she makes Stella look like a fool with her unironic treatment of a mental image as something concrete that could have gone somewhere. In another instance, a conversation Stella has about being an artist, a stilted effort at a conversational tone supersedes all other flaws: “‘Can you do that?’ he asked. ‘Just decide to become an artist?’ ‘Well, you could. It’s better if you feel you have some talent.’”
Nevertheless, perhaps Shreve should listen to her own character on this last point. In any case, the verdict is clear: “Stella Bain” possesses less literary charm than a CVS sales circular. The most alarming aspect, however, is that Shreve is considered a person of some literary importance, with an O. Henry award under her belt and an elevation to the pantheon of the Oprah Book Club. These are dark times. All one can do is hope for a better, less baneful future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I didn’t realize until I started filling out my plan of study how terrified I was of the future. Not the whole future, exactly—I’ve always been fairly optimistic about having a generally happy life—but of making choices. I have known since high school that I was really interested in music and languages, and was fairly certain that I wanted to study linguistics and music in college. I made my college decision based on that fact (as well as on the ridiculous good luck of having gotten into Harvard), and I wrote my college essay on my observations of the relationship between language and culture in Russia. Yet somehow when people asked what I was concentrating in, my answer always had a qualifier—“I think I’m doing a joint in linguistics and music.” When I was feeling insecure, this qualifier would turn into a long string of maybes—“I think I might be doing either music or linguistics—or maybe a combination?—something along those lines. I still haven’t decided. We’ll see.”
 
 The week before plans of study were due, these maybes spiraled into an internal monologue of doubts. How is this all going to fit into two and half years? Isn’t a joint concentration just a half-qualified version of each? Who would hire someone with such impractical interests? How am I expecting to join two different fields in one thesis if I can’t even figure out how to work the online student portal?
 
 The scariest part of this week for me was not finding things I was interested in; it was eliminating the option of saying “maybe.” I’m not sure what I was afraid of; possibly that other people (who presumably all have both practical and impressive concentrations, and work to cure cancer) would say “Oh... linguistics and music...well, I guess good luck getting a job and succeeding in life?” Or possibly that I would choose the wrong thing—that everything up until now had been moving me further and further from some unknown life goal, but there was still time to turn back! All I had to do was to find that secret calling (which in my head was always something more practical, like economics) and put it in my plan of study, and have the wonderful, successful life that might not lie at the end of a music-linguistics path.
 
 And yet so far no secret calling has emerged from the depths of my psyche. I didn’t have any great moment of regret or post-submission panic, and so far all the reactions I have gotten from friends and acquaintances have been enthusiastically positive. (Of course, it might be that people are being polite, but I’m going to choose to take their enthusiasm at face value.) And something else happened that I didn’t anticipate: turning in my plan of study made me feel secure and established. Eliminating other options has given me two fields—and one plan—that I can really call my own. 
 
 I feel like this is closely tied to something that I see people all around me doing, and that I know I struggle with—trying to achieve breadth and depth at the same time, convinced that if we try hard enough we can choose everything at once. Maybe—if we’re just hardworking enough—we can become concert pianists and world-renowned scientists and Olympic skiers, and still have time to sleep and see friends once in a while. What, it’s not working? Just draw out a more ambitious schedule for the week and try harder. And what we’re sacrificing—along with sleep, or exercise, or a social life (or, sometimes, all of the above)—is the security that comes with finding a niche, and focusing our energies in order to excel at one thing. If we try to pick everything, we will only be a fraction of the pianist/scientist/skier we could have been, and what’s more, we will be a pianist/scientist/skier without a sense of purpose—without a feeling of home. Declaring a concentration does mean sacrificing an exploratory period, but it also means setting down the doubts and indecision and lack of stability that comes with exploring, and hopefully realizing that you’ve found the field you went in search of in the first place.

This time of year, a tree outside my high school never failed to make me cry.
It wasn’t a fearful site—no friend of mine fell from its limbs to crippledom. No dear classroom pet requiescats in pace beneath the soil that surrounds it. In fact, the tears were happy ones, and yet I could not even attach a meaningful moment to the maple. The sapling, when it came down to it, was entirely average in all ways but one: In the fall, as its relatives took on varying shades of dull brown and orange, its leaves turned a brilliant red. And then my eyes began to sting.
Did this tree, a burst of color against the dull background of my alma mater’s faded brick walls, stand as a symbol of the wonder of learning that I sometimes let slip me by amid the drudge and drear of academic tedium? Sounds like a stretch. When I try to conjure up any interpretation, I feel as if I’m sitting in English class waxing not-so-eloquent about a character’s motivation in a novel I couldn’t find the time to read.
I have to throw rationality to the wind. The tree opened my floodgates because, well, it was a really nice tree. Its redness made me feel something I cannot describe, and there’s nothing more to it.
Maybe I’m crazy. But even after I had to forsake my favorite foliage for new trees lining the banks of the Charles, I found a replacement. Outside of the Science Center, near Littauer and the law school, sits a tin-roofed stump fitted with a small wooden door, a placard above the entrance reading “Mr. Sanders”—some letters backwards—and another sign advising visitors to “rnig also.” Harvard houses Nobel laureates and piano prodigies, but nothing struck me more my freshman year than seeing Winnie-the-Pooh’s front stoop right outside my Yard. Pooh’s pad moved me at college in the same way the good old maple tree did at home. Every time I passed it, it caught me and my tear ducts off guard—just because.
But this year, something horrible happened, something that only further convinced me of the foolishness of my reaction to trees and stumps alike. I returned to campus to find Pooh’s door ripped from its hinges, the pebbles surrounding the stump scattered, and the bark edifice haphazardly spray-painted. Some vandal had ruined the (inexplicably) best part of my day. I felt disproportionately depressed, and I also felt alone. No one else understood my sadness, and no one else seemed to mind the destruction.
Until now. On Friday, during my daily trek from River to Quad, I discovered with joy that Pooh had acquired himself a replacement door, carefully crafted and firmly fixed onto his home. Whether George Eastman, the house’s “unofficial gatekeeper,” or an unidentified Good Samaritan in the night, someone had taken it upon him or herself to restore Cambridge’s little sliver of the Hundred Acre Wood to its former glory. Someone had found the structure as worthy of saving as I did. Someone had felt my same entirely indefinable but equally indefatigable feeling. In one sense or another, this revelation elevated Pooh’s tree above the one so central to my teenage years. It taught me that I was not alone after all.
We live in a world where thought trumps feeling. That’s true for a reason: Most of the time, it does serve to scratch beneath the surface, whether in our personal pursuits or our academic ambitions. The latter pushes us especially hard as college students; we believe we must derive a logical explanation for everything that nature throws in our paths. But sometimes, something small out there touches us, and it does so without reason and without explanation. When that happens, we should cast away our compulsion to analyze. It doesn’t mean we’re silly—it means we’re human.
William Wordsworth wrote, “To me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.” For a self-acknowledged chronic crier like me, no thought lies too deep for tears. But some little things in my life lie deep enough to inspire that and more. A sanguine leaf drifting to the ground, a freshly sanded, lacquered front door on Winnie-the-Pooh’s Cambridge home, a cup of English Breakfast tea infused with just the right amount of lemon and sugar. They cause my eyes to well up, my stomach to turn flips, and my heart to skip beats.
Why? I couldn’t tell you. I also couldn’t care less.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we opined in September, the Undergraduate Council performs an often thankless, but nonetheless important job. We sat down with representatives from each of the three tickets vying to lead the UC, and only one seemed capable of rising to that task. We endorse C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse Goffard ’15.
After speaking with the candidates, we are convinced that Gong and Goffard are best equipped to handle the UC’s day-to-day business. Gong and Goffard present themselves as the most experienced ticket, and the two of them have put in the hours on bread-and-butter issues to back that claim up. Gong has proven an effective administrator of funds and is working to achieve better mental health services for students—an issue on which administration has already shown a willingness to heed student voices. Goffard has been instrumental in improving our dining experience and is working for better shuttle services. These specific and practical measures form the backbone of the Gong and Goffard campaign, and suggest that the ticket is more than prepared to lead the UC in its day-to-day business.
Chika-Dike Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15—running against Gong and Goffard—fail to emphasize practical issues. In our conversation with them, they presented themselves as the “more relatable” ticket, neglecting to satisfactorily explain how that will create an improved experience for students. When asked what differentiated their ticket, Nwokike and Kim cited their ability to engage with a diverse array of students—again, without really explaining how or to what end. Gong’s and Goffard’s website bios cite examples of substantive work they have done. Nwokike, on the other hand, speaks of “[fostering] inclusion and strong dialogue” and Kim emphasizes her “unparalleled knowledge of the Council’s infrastructure.” These are, no doubt, good things—but it tells us little about their ability to wrestle with the day-to-day administrative issues facing the UC.
We believe that the UC needs practical leadership to fulfill its day-to-day duties—from funding student organizations to managing the room reservation site—while increasing the pressure on Harvard to listen to student voices. Rhetoric about enhanced communication does nothing to further that goal.
In terms of larger vision, little distinguishes the two serious tickets. Both advocate for dining services during longer breaks, both call for an increase in funding for undergraduate activities, and both want to revamp freshmen opening days programs. Tellingly, both tickets promise to work toward a Latino and Latin American Studies degree program—the same exact promise made by current President Tara Raghuveer ’14 and Jen Zhu ’14 last year. In our conversations with them, both tickets stress the importance of influencing campus-wide policy through student referenda, but neither has outlined a clear vision of how to do so. In light of the Harvard’s recent refusal to divest from fossil fuels, we doubt the UC’s ability to influence campus-wide policy under any leadership team. Neither serious ticket convinces us otherwise.
While neither vision inspires us, Gong and Goffard impress us with their concrete experience and their earnest desire to unify and represent students. We believe that they alone have potential to fulfill the UC’s administrative tasks while pressuring the University to give greater weight to student concerns. For a more effective and representative UC, our endorsement goes to C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse Goffard ’15.

My roommate did not initially want me to tell you this story. She’s since agreed that she can deal.
Our shower drain, on the other hand, cannot deal with the volume of hair that it’s been tasked with handling. We figure Currier House was built before Harvard/Radcliffe admitted too many of our kind—our bathroom was probably intended for a pair of flaxen, thin-haired maidens, not two Jewish girls with manes.
While I spend a great deal more time thinking about what I’m going to have for lunch (hopefully not that barbecue tofu stodge that HUDS has the audacity to call pizza), I’d be lying if I said that I never think about my hair. I am, after all, a 20 year-old female from earth. So you can imagine my mortification when I found out that someone had suggested that I would be pretty if I were to “do my hair.”
Before they let me turn 20, they made me do all of the numbers below that. Indeed, up until the age of 12, I considered myself a member of the follicular elect—my hair was blonde and wavy. It was that summer that I realized I’d fallen from grace.
First, I learned the theory of chromatic relativity: What was blonde in New York City was not what was blonde to the Southern girls I went to horseback riding camp with. As I got older and my hair darkened further, this theory became irrelevant. I was a brunette. (If I were less selfish, I’d emphasize how telling it is that we categorize women according to their hair color. But I didn’t especially mind the blonde/brunette hierarchy. I just minded being on the bottom of it.)
Next I learned that there exists a special place in hell for girls who do not straighten, relax, or otherwise tame hair that is dark and (for me, newly) voluminous. At least that’s what my counselor suggested with her death stare as she struggled to fit my hair underneath my helmet before a horse show.
I’ve learned a lot about the world since I was 12. I know that society is a lot less hard on me about my hair than it is on women of color—the last thing I want to do is to trivialize the racial and cultural bias faced by anyone else. I just want to tell you a story—a human story, I think—about feeling ugly and bad.
My first impulse upon hearing the upsetting comment about doing my hair was to figure out what the other women were “doing” that I wasn’t. I went for a walk and saw straights, curlies, even blues and pinks (it is Cambridge, after all)—what was wrong with me, in particular?
Then I called my sister and read her the famous line from Robert Burns’s poem, “To a Louse”:“And would some Power the small gift give us, To see ourselves as others see us!” “Lisa,” she reassured me, “no one thinks you look like Kyle Broflovski without his hat on. You’re not even a redhead!”
I know (I watch coming-of-age Lifetime movies, too) that I’m supposed to love me for me. And, I admit, that in addition to feeling inadequate I felt an intense desire to prosecute the offending commenter for crimes against Lisa Mogilanski and humanity. As one of my friends pointed out, there’s only so much loathing to go around—we ought to direct it outward rather than squander it on ourselves.
But, broadly speaking, self-acceptance is not my style—I prefer slowly and painfully to analyze (and hopefully eliminate) my flaws. Indeed, if I were physically and mentally capable of sleeping less than I currently do, I’d probably get up an hour earlier each day to “do” my hair.
I’ve decided, instead, that I prefer the sweet spot between denial, laziness, and acceptance, laughing and reminding myself that no one thinks about me nearly as much as I do. This is bold—female physical imperfections aren’t supposed to be funny, just sort of sad. You can make a joke, but when you’re done laughing you’d better make an appointment to get something waxed.
But in baseball and in genetic lotteries, you win some, you lose some, and some get rained out (in this latter scenario you also go home with frizzy hair). We’ve all got some things we wish could change, even if we’re not rich or desperate enough to get the surgery.
I think the advice of the Wu Tang Clan is wise and applicable: “Don’t chase people. Be you, do your own thing and work hard. The right people who belong in your life will come to you and stay.” (It makes sense that they would say this—most of the hip-hop group grew up on Staten Island, which means that anyone who came to visit had to like them enough to get on a ferry.)
The people who like me in spite of my hair—or, God forbid, because of it—are the ones who matter. And if there are no obvious “right people,” people who’ll come to me, I’ll just go hang out with the men in front of CVS. They seem to like me no matter what I do to my hair.

In response to an influx of tourists from China, Harvard Square’s The Charles Hotel is making an effort to increase its knowledge of Chinese customs to better cater to the expanding clientele.
In the past two years, the number of Chinese guests at The Charles Hotel has doubled, general manager Alex Attia estimated. Now, the hotel greets those guests with a Chinese website, a staff member fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese on duty at all times, and a pair of slippers in each room.
The New York Times reported last week that The Preferred Hotel Group, which includes The Charles, plans to launch a targeted marketing program called China Ready next month.
The Charles Hotel, for its part, has already taken strides to welcome the wave of travelers from China.
“From our standpoint, we really focus on the fact that in the Chinese culture, the hierarchy is still very important,” Attia said. “When we get the information on the traveler, we want to make sure we know who is the senior person and who is the junior person and make sure that we have the senior person on the highest floor, and so on.”
The Charles offers a discounted rate to guests visiting Harvard’s campus, and the university is a major draw for Chinese visitors to Cambridge. Attia said that the hotel conducted research in preparation for the new program that found Harvard to be the number one brand in China, just ahead of Coca-Cola.
“From our perspective, we know there are more Chinese visitors to Harvard the last couple of years, and we are lucky to be on the grounds,” Attia said.
The Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism reported that the number of Chinese visitors to Massachusetts rose by 7.9 percent from 2011 to 2012, and that 10 percent of all Chinese tourists visiting the United States in 2012 came to Massachusetts.
For Attia, the nationwide efforts to welcome tourists from China are just the latest development in the hotel industry. Attia said he watched as the hotel business accommodated a similar surge in travelers from Japan in the mid-1980s, followed by a response to the growth of the Brazilian market in the early 1990s.
“This is our business’ reaction to the new traveler,” Attia said. “For us now, it is the Chinese market, and we’re trying to make it as easy and comfortable for the traveler to spend their time in our neighborhood.”

With 13 votes separating her from a seat on the Council, defeated incumbent Minka Y. vanBeuzekom says she will likely petition for a recount of this fall’s municipal ballots. 
“Yes, that’s likely my intent,” vanBeuzekom told The Crimson on Sunday, adding, “There’s still some things that I’m looking at.”
VanBeuzekom has until Wednesday at 5 p.m. to gather 50 signatures to petition the Cambridge Election Commission to stage a recount.
The last time Cambridge conducted a recount, in 2001, the process took a month to complete and cost the city $38,509.
On Friday night, the Cambridge Election Commission examined its last batch of ballots and finalized its official vote count. The outcome reaffirmed the preliminary result, declaring Nadeem Mazen was the winner of a hotly contested spot on the Cambridge City Council.
Going into the final count, Mazen was leading vanBeuzekom by just six votes, but Friday’s results widened that gap, putting vanBeuzekom 13 votes off from a seat on the Council.
Given the potential for a recount request, Mazen asked the Election Commission about the margin of error on the city’s voting machines.
“This is going to end up being pretty critical,” Mazen said.
Peter Sheinfeld, a member of the Board of Election Commissioners, replied that there might be one miscounted vote per several thousand votes.
Because of Cambridge’s unique system for municipal elections, small changes can produce larger results in unconventional ways. In the last round of vote counting, the addition of six final ballots caused vanBeuzekom to lose four votes, but a recount could produce different results.
The Commission began Friday night by considering nine provisional ballots that had not been counted in the preliminary rounds due to problems with voter registration and six overseas ballots. Ultimately, only three of the provisional ballots and three of the overseas ballots were deemed valid.
With magnifying glasses in hand, the Commission examined the stamps on the six overseas ballots, which, according to city bylaws, must be postmarked by election day.
One envelope with a illegible postmark made several rounds of the Commissioners’ table.
Polyxane Cobb, who sits on the Board of Election Commissioners, finally opened it.
“This is for December,” she exclaimed, and nervous laughter filled the room.
Several City Council candidates—including vanBeuzekom, Mazen, Craig A. Kelley, Elie Yarden, and James Williamson—had crowded into the Election Commission’s main office on Inman Street in Central Square to witness the two hours of ballot examination.
At nightfall, Ethridge King of the Board of Election Commissioners announced the results.
“This will be official but not final,” King said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: November 18, 2013, at 9:02 p.m.
President Obama announced Thursday that he intends to nominate Vivek H. Murthy ’98, a physician and instructor at Harvard Medical School, as Surgeon General of the United States.
 
The co-founder of Doctors for America, a national movement of more than 16,000 physicians and medical students working to improve the health of the nation, Murthy has not yet secured the position. Before assuming the new role, he must first face a Senate confirmation hearing that has not yet been scheduled.
 
If successful, Murthy will become the youngest surgeon general in U.S. history and will replace acting Surgeon General Boris D. Lushniak, an alumnus of the Harvard School of Public Health.
 
“I thought it was a great decision made by the President,” said Allen Kachalia, an associate professor at Harvard School of Public Health and long-time friend. “My initial reaction was that I was very happy for Dr. Murthy because he has been a longstanding advocate for better health care. And I was happy for the country because we were getting another great leader.”
 
Given the current political climate, however, it is uncertain whether or not Murthy will secure the position.
 
The four-year post has little formal power but carries substantial influence on key issues in public health, especially in light of the recent rollout of the healthcare exchanges. A strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, Murthy would aid in its implementation and evaluation over the coming years.
 
In addition to teaching at the Medical School, Murthy currently works at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. In 2008, Murthy helped found Doctors for Obama, which later became Doctors for America.
 
The group says that it is non-partisan and does not support any particular political candidate or administration, but it has expressed support for President Obama’s healthcare reforms and filed an amicus brief for the Supreme Court in support of the ACA’s individual insurance mandate.
 
While Murthy himself has stated that he spent most of his life outside of politics, in recent years he has become involved, he said, in efforts to influence healthcare reform. He was appointed by President Obama in 2011 to a group that advises the Surgeon General.
 
“He has shown himself to be a caring and compassionate physician,” said Kachalia. “He has been an advocate of improving our health care system and improving access for everybody.”
 
Murthy is also co-founder and chairman of TrialNetworks, a clinical trial optimization system, and co-founder of VISIONS Worldwide, a non-profit organization that focuses on HIV/AIDS education in India and the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last May, C.C. Gong ’15 was worried about waking up in time for a final exam. But Sietse K. Goffard ’15 had her back.
At 7 a.m., Gong found Goffard outside her door, waiting with a homemade breakfast complete with hand-squeezed orange juice.
That sort of friendship, Gong said, would make the pair “the perfect working team” to serve as president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council.
“I think you need to be friends to work so closely and so hard with each other,” Gong said.
Their fellow UC representatives said that the two candidates complement each other both personally and professionally.
Friends said that Gong was known for her role in spearheading social initiatives such as the Council’s outing to Salem during Halloween, while Goffard was heavily involved in student advocacy projects such as securing weekend and morning shuttles to the Quad.
“The mission of the UC is social and infrastructural development, and if one of them is good at the social and the other is good at infrastructural, as are C.C. and Sietse, then you have a match made in heaven,” UC Lowell House Representative Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 said.
The duo envisions a transformed Council focused on increasing student activities funding, advocating for inclusivity, and empowering students.
‘GO FORWARD’
Using a word-play inspired by their last names, Gong and Goffard’s main slogan “Go Forward” captures the ticket’s goals.
Naming student needs that they plan to focus on, they listed more inclusive dining options, more accessible mental health resources, and improved housing and transportation. They say that the UC’s budget, nearly half a million dollars, has been constant since 2006 despite the increasing number of student organizations.
“What the University is taking from students is not increasing in proportion to what students are putting into their own student life,” Gong said.
Gong and Goffard also said that they hope to encourage students to use We the Crimson, an online platform that allows undergraduates to submit petitions. And they want to increase student participation in Harvard’s capital campaign, an ongoing effort which aims to raise $6.5 billion.
“Students have had no input on the slices of pie that this money is going to thus far,” Goffard said.
C.C. HER GO
When asked to describe his running partner in one word, Goffard’s immediate response was “selfless.”
Gong, who hails from Anaheim, Calif., has dedicated much of her extracurricular career at Harvard to serving on the UC.  Since freshman year, the psychology concentrator has been part of each of the UC’s five committees.
Gong has been heavily involved in major initiatives such as the new Student Initiatives Grant, which aims to foster student entrepreneurship on campus, as well as the UC Outings Program, through which she organized Halloween trips to Salem.
“I’m someone who, when I see something that I want to change, I want to be in the position where I can make that change,” Gong said.  “I felt that the UC was a really great channel for me to be able to address student concerns and student needs and make the changes that I wanted to see made.”
Outside of the UC, serves as vice president of the Ivy Council, a group of student leaders from the Ivy League schools, and works as a student mental health liaison and a peer speaking tutor. She is also an inactive Crimson editor.
“C.C. genuinely cares about other people,” said her roommate Julia M. Bruce ’15.  “I know she is not running to receive the title of president. She is running because she has the passion to make changes for the better.”
IT’S LIKE PIZZA WITH AN ‘S’
Born in Belgium, Goffard spent his early childhood in the United States before moving to Paris. He attributes his commitment to inclusivity to the morals instilled in him by his mother in his youth.
“She always stressed the need to be nice to everyone and to include everyone,” Goffard said. “Maybe subconsciously, that’s what’s driven my fuel for fundamental equality and inclusion on campus.”
Goffard began his advocacy work even before his UC career. As a freshman, he worked to implement healthy options in dining halls, including fresh fruit bars on Tuesdays and more vegetarian and vegan choices, as a member of the Harvard University Dining Services Student Advisory Committee.
During his sophomore year, he ran for the UC under the slogan “Like pizza? Vote for Sietse,” which he said was a tribute to his HUDS experience as well as his love for cooking. While on the UC, he led the final phase of the nearly four-year-long effort to reinstate weekend and morning shuttles from the Quad.
According to Goffard, these experiences have helped him and Gong create a platform “grounded in realism and giving back to the community.”
“At the end of the day, the UC, like all politics, is all about public service,” he said.

Historically, political campaigns have chosen theme songs about topics like hope and change.
But Chika-Dike O. Nwokike ’15 and Una Kim ’15, campaigning to run Harvard’s Undergraduate Council, prefer songs that are a bit less predictable.
Vice-presidential candidate Kim said her current favorite band is Yelvis, whose recent song “Massachusetts” may be an anthem for Harvard students.
Presidential candidate Nwokike’s choice of campaign song? Any song by Kanye West, he said.
These choices of songs that resonate with students today reflect Nwokike’s and Kim’s desire to bridge the divide between the UC and students.
THE PAIR
Kim and Nwokike first met on the UC’s executive board during their sophomore year. Kim said that Nwokike impressed her as competent and congenial.
“People on the council immediately recognized him and all the great things he had done at the time,” Kim said.
Kim also made a lasting impression on Nwokike, as someone who is capable and pleasant to be around.
“I always had a really deep admiration for the work that Una did on the council,” Nwokike said.
The two have remained friends since, and they believe their separate strengths would help them lead the UC.
“We have a balance,” Kim said. “Dike is a visionary and steps hard into each game; I’m detail-oriented and focused on logistics.”
Nwokike echoed her. “I have larger goals and see larger things. Una can build a very detailed road map for how we’re going to get those things done.”
In addition, as the two of them laughed together, they said that their interpersonal relationship is key to their work. As Kim put it, “It’s important that we like each other.”
The duo also points to the diversity of their backgrounds and academic experiences.
“We’re very diverse, not just in race and ethnicity, but also in what we’re studying and the different organizations we’re a part of,” Kim said. “We’re successful because we bring new ideas to each other.”
THE VISIONARY
Nwokike’s friends say he is a strong and considerate leader.
“Dike is a team player,” said Chris H. Cleveland ’14, who worked with Nwokike on the Harvard Black Men's Forum. “He’s good at playing his role while working with other people.”
Originally from New Rochelle, N.Y., Nwokike has been an active participant in a wide range of activities on campus. He was a photographer for The Crimson and was at the forefront of the newspaper’s newly established diversity committee. He was also a chair of the Black Men’s Forum.
He said that his commitment to diversity would influence his tenure as UC President. He said he would convene discussions between students and administrators on topics like racial sensitivity, sexual assault policy, and mental health.
Nwokike, who hopes to pursue a career in finance, has sought the UC presidency for a long time, according to his friends.
“I’ve been hearing Dike talk about wanting to be UC president since he got here,” Cleveland said. “I’m glad he’s following through with his desires and I know he’ll do a really good job.”
THE TASKMASTER
Kim, an economics concentrator in Eliot House, is described by her friends as a passionate and organized go-getter who tends to get the job done.  When planning nights out on the town, Kim is typically the person who arranges destinations, transportation, and activities.
These skills, according to her closest companions, go further than just scheduling social gatherings. “Una is not just going to take up the ideas that she knows will have success,” said Daniel S. Park ’15, who has been friends with Kim since their freshman year.  “She’ll take the bigger, more creative ideas and actively try to make them reality through her meticulous and detail-oriented nature.”
Originally from Chicago, Kim has served on the UC since her sophomore year. During that time, she was elected to the executive board as parliamentarian and oversaw a rare meeting of the Council and Harvard’s Board of Overseers.
“I was alarmed to see how disconnected the board was with students,” she said. “Through that meeting, I got to learn how to effectively work with the administration.”
She said that the experience fueled her desire to improve relationships between students and administrators.
Kim has experiences in many facets of campus life, from participating in the Harvard College Consulting Group to singing for Christian a cappella group Under Construction to volunteering through the Phillips Brooks House Association.
“She’s very caring and takes a lot of time to take interest in her friends, which I appreciate,” Park said. “Together, Una and Dike have the ability to make both practical and substantive changes to the Harvard community.”
CHANGE FOR NOW AND LATER
In their years on the UC, Nwokike and Kim said, they have observed a disconnect between the UC and the student body.
“I realized that this situation could be ameliorated if UC presidential tickets were more relatable to the undergraduate community,” Nwokike said. “I strongly believe Una and I are.”
They said they hope to increase student interest in what the UC has to offer, starting by engaging UC members themselves. In addition to increasing student engagement, their campaign emphasizes practicality and feasible initiatives.
“The Council hasn’t always been able to follow through with their initiatives,” Nwokike said. “Students and Council members become disengaged, and people take the Council less seriously.”
The pair has devised practical projects, from enabling online ticket purchases from the Harvard Box Office and providing longer dining hall hours.
And they said that while they plan to follow through on their campaign promises, they also feel responsible for building a strong foundation for future changes.
“It’s our job that even if change isn’t instituted in our year, we have to lay the groundwork for the advocacy of it in the following years,” Nwokike said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wearing a button-down shirt and slacks, a clean-shaven Samuel B. Clark ’15 appeared presidential as he entered Boylston Hall last Wednesday. After politely excusing himself, Clark returned several minutes later alongside running mate Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15—now sporting matching gold, glittering American Apparel jackets.
With the stern look of political office on their faces, the duo sat down to discuss their game plan: to emerge from the shadows of a dark horse candidacy to capture the coveted crowns of Undergraduate Council president and vice president.
“We have absolutely zero experience with anything to do with the UC,” Clark said matter-of-factly. “However, we think that this really is an asset for us more than anything else.”
In a race where gender neutral housing, the efficacy of student voices, and UC funding seem to be the most pressing issues, Clark and Mayopoulos have proposed an outsider agenda. Centered on the promises of tomato basil ravioli soup served daily in the dining halls, thicker toilet paper for all, and “divesting from gender neutral weekend shuttles,” the campaign seeks to usher in a new approach to UC leadership.
Specific issues aside, the glitter-garbed candidates’ campaign posters and Facebook page make a central slogan clear: “You could do worse.”
THE BROMANCE
The relationship between Clark and Mayopoulos is founded on many years of intimacy, the pair said.
“If there’s sex, there’s sex. And if there’s not, there’s not,” Mayopoulos said. The two have been roommates since freshman year and currently share a room in Kirkland House.
“I think their relationship is one of kindred spirits, and deep friendship, and trust, which is important,” said roommate Mark J. Mauriello ’15. “You need that in a team.”
Clark, a social studies concentrator from Denver, Colo., and Mayopoulos, a history concentrator from Charlotte, N.C., have bonded over the years through their shared interest in humor and satire. Best known by students for their comedy work on campus, Clark and Mayopoulos currently serve as co-presidents of On Thin Ice, an on-campus improv comedy troupe. Mayopoulos is also president of Satire V, and Clark is a correspondent for On Harvard Time.
In addition to a plethora of leadership roles, Clark and Mayopoulos also tout their experience founding FUMPER, the Freshman Undergraduate Municipal Police Enforcement Reinforcement, an organization dedicated to stopping rule-breaking bikers in Harvard Yard.
“I wouldn’t call us life savers,” Clark said. “But I would call us certainly life enhancers.”
Both tickets competing with the Kirkland duo bring several years of UC experience to the race, putting the question of Clark and Mayopoulos’ qualifications in the spotlight.
“We’re not the UC insiders. We don’t get to ride in the UC helicopters; we don’t get to go to the UC spas,” Clark said. “UC members only have to take like seven gen eds. We have to take all eight gen eds. We even have to take Science of the Physical Universe.”
THE AGENDA
The campaign’s origin can be traced to a grievance with the soup choices of Harvard University Dining Services.
“A couple of months ago, I wrote to HUDS on one of the comment cards, and I said, ‘The tomato basil ravioli soup was excellent. I would like to see more of it. I would like it every day.’”
Mayopoulos said his dreams were shattered when a HUDS staff member responded that the dining service was glad he enjoyed the soup, and he could expect to see it again in two weeks.
“It really wasn’t an adequate response, but I really didn’t have any place to turn except for the UC for support,” Mayopoulos said. “And I realized that I was fighting for myself [and] what I believed in. And I realized that I really wasn’t the only person. I think it’s overwhelmingly a very popular soup.”
Recognizing that one political platform cannot win an election, Clark and Mayopoulos created other plans that they believe will win them votes as well. In sharp contrast with other candidates, the pair is advocating for increased toilet paper thickness and an entirely different approach to divestment.
“The thing is that we need to be divesting from more things, we need to be making more things gender neutral, and we need to be shuttling things more on weekends. So why not do it all at the same time?” Clark said. “Divest from gender neutral weekend shuttles.”
A SERIOUS CAMPAIGN
With digital polls opening Monday, Clark and Mayopoulos have been papering the walls of Harvard buildings with campaign posters for several days. Some promote claims such as “more diverse than any other ticket,” while others flaunt their credentials: Clark was the vice president of his high school drama club and is proficient with Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, but notably not Excel, according to one poster. Mayopoulos is a U.S. citizen and has all eight toes, according to the poster.
Even Stephen A. Turban ’17, a campaign manager for the rival ticket of C.C. Gong ’15 and Sietse K. Goffard ’15, expressed fondness for Clark and Mayopoulos.
“They’re a meta-satire, which is the coolest thing. It’s the most hilarious joke. I am a huge fan. I am not voting for them, but I think they’re awesome,” Turban said.
But pitted against stiff competition, Clark and Mayopoulos maintained that they have prepared themselves to run a fierce campaign in the face of skeptics.
“I would say to them that if they think that what we’re advocating for is a joke, that’s their prerogative,” Clark said. “But we’re in it to win it.”

Much to the displeasure of librarians and professors, Harvard Business School Publishing is pursuing a new strategy to increase revenue from Harvard Business Review articles assigned as course readings. Claiming that many schools have been avoiding proper licensing payments, on Aug. 1, the publisher began blocking full EBSCO access to the 500 most popular Harvard Business Review articles. 
HBR articles, typically summaries of academic work written to be accessible to businesspeople, are a staple of most business school curricula. These articles have been available through the digital journal aggregator EBSCO since 2000, but in 2009, HBSP began seeking additional fees from some university libraries. They argued that EBSCO licenses are for academic research purposes only and do not cover the distribution of articles as course materials.
The new access restriction means that all business schools now face a choice: purchase a “course use” license at prices reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education to range from less than $10,000 to $200,000, purchase articles for course use individually under existing “umbrella plans,” or stop distributing the online version of HBR’s articles in their courses.
This shift has frustrated many schools and librarians, now forced to pay a higher price for a privilege they have enjoyed for more than a decade. Andy Spackman, chair of the business reference and services section of the American Library Association, said that the HBR policy violates not only academic norms but also industry norms for digital aggregators such as EBSCO.
“Such use and activity is normal in the internet age,” he said. “It’s irksome if a publisher tries to impose a definition of what constitutes normal library use, and it’s an ironic peculiarity that HBR would provide libraries with digital access to their content and then insist that professors should not direct students toward these articles.”
The ALA sponsored a task force to evaluate HBSP’s actions, and issued a statement that “[HBSP's] profit driven practices diverge from the intent of scholarly communication and impinge on higher education and libraries’ core social mission to preserve and make accessible records of scholarship.”
Brian Kenny, a spokesperson for HBSP, maintains that the Aug. 1 restrictions do not represent a new policy, but rather a means of enforcing existing terms of use.
“The stipulation that a library is only purchasing access to HBR through EBSCO for private individual use (e.g., for research) dates to the beginning of our agreement with EBSCO in 2000 and has never changed,”  Kenny said in an email. “We have had numerous conversations over the past 13 years with business librarians who use EBSCO to ensure that they are aware of and understand the terms of use.” He also stated that libraries had been warned of the impending restrictions beginning on April 1.
Kenny emphasized HBR’s unique purpose and the resources that it requires. “Unlike other academic journals, HBR editors work closely with authors to help them craft their ideas in ways that make sense to practitioners,” he said. “The EBSCO policy is essential to protect this long standing practice and thereby sustain HBR’s mission,” he said.
Several HBS professors declined to comment, citing respect for the thought their colleagues at HBSP put into decisions regarding EBSCO access.
The new practice has sparked much online debate, including a back-and-forth between Joshua Gans, a professor at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management and Das Narayandas, professor of business administration at HBS and senior associate dean for Harvard Business Publishing, who criticized each other’s statements in a series of Financial Times editorials.

Protesters held a rally Friday to voice complaints of police brutality, claiming that the Cambridge Police Department injured a protester picketing outside of Insomnia Cookies the previous night.
Jason Freedman, the protester, sustained injuries to his face, back, and arms while being arrested by the police, claimed Geoffrey Carens, a Harvard library assistant and Industrial Workers of the World member.
Freedman was arrested on charges of assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct, according to CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello.
Freedman declined to comment Sunday.
Thursday night’s protest was one in a series of monthly pickets at the 65 Mount Auburn St. store that began in August, when several workers fired by the cookie shop made claims of labor rights violations. The protesters urge the company each month to increase wages and let workers unionize.
The picket on Thursday began at approximately 9:30 p.m., according to IWW member Christopher M. Perkins, who was present at the protest.
“We were chanting and holding signs, trying to make the point that Insomnia Cookies is unfair to its workers,” Perkins said.
More than a dozen CPD officers arrived at the scene approximately 20 minutes into the picket, according to Perkins.
Riviello wrote in an emailed statement, “Officers dispatched to this location were attempting to strike a balance between the freedom of speech of the [protesters] and the rights of pedestrians and business to access the public sidewalk.”
According to Perkins, the CPD officers approached a protester holding a megaphone and demanded that he turn it off. The protester complied.
“Nonetheless, they began pushing the person who was holding the microphone,” Perkins said.
Freedman then approached the CPD officers to demand that they not touch the protester with the megaphone, according to Perkins. One of the CPD officers then punched Freedman in the face, he said.
Genevieve Lechat, an IWW member who was also present at the protest, said that she took photos of Freedman as he was being assaulted. The photos, which have been circulated online and over email lists, seem to show a man that Lechat identified as Freedman being overpowered by several officers outside of Insomnia.
Riviello did not respond to a question about a photograph that seemed to show officers subduing Freedman.
Carens, who has previously supported labor movements at Harvard, wrote in an emailed statement that the police threw Freedman on the trunk of a vehicle and then on the ground, “pinning him partially under a parked car and on the curb as they piled on top of him.”
Riviello wrote that CPD was attempting to move protesters “to a more suitable location that would not impact the free and safe flow of pedestrian traffic on a public sidewalk and allow for safe exit/entry to a business when a [protester] became violent, struck a police officer, and was taken into custody.”
“CPD serves to protect the rights of all pedestrians, businesses, and [protesters] by providing for the safety of all to freely move about in public spaces,” Riviello wrote in an emailed statement.
The Student Action Labor Movement has supported the Insomnia workers’ protests. “I wasn’t there, but I think the Cambridge police carried out a hostile and unwarranted attack against people [who] I believe are peaceful,” said SLAM member Gabriel H. Bayard ’15. “I hope IWW and CPD can come to a peaceful resolution to the matter that will protect our right to peaceful protest.”
Freedman was arraigned Friday, according to Riviello. Perkins said that Freedman is being represented by an attorney of the National Lawyers Guild.
Insomnia Cookies could not be reached for comment late Sunday afternoon.

Restaurant owners in the former Holyoke Center said the University gave them little notice of its plans to overhaul the building at the center of the Square, but said they still hope to be part of the site’s future after part of the building becomes a new campus center.
After securing a large donation from an alumnus, the University announced on Thursday it was changing the building’s name to the Smith Center, and would renovate the bottom three floors of the building for student use.
Barry F. Penn, a partner at Al’s Harvard Square Cafe, said a representative from Harvard informed him of the plan on Wednesday—the day before the public announcement.
“No substantive [information] has been provided [to us] because it is my understanding that this project is in the preliminary planning stage,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.
“It did come as a surprise to me,” said Steve Welch, an operating owner of Oggi Gourmet. “I didn’t know that they were going to change the name until just before it happened.”
Both Welch and Penn expressed their support for the project, yet they remain unsure whether their respective eateries will figure in the new Smith Campus Center. In addition to Oggi Gourmet and Al’s, the first floor of the Smith Campus Center currently houses a Harvard-affiliated pharmacy, tour center, and box office.
A number of the offices of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are located on the third floor. The second floor is separate from the main structure of the center and was formerly occupied by Cambridge Trust Company offices, some of which have been relocated to Boston.
University spokesperson Lauren M. Marshall wrote in an email Monday that it was too early to say how the renovations would affect tenants.
“There will be a process to gather ideas from students, faculty, and staff to guide the development of spaces that will support everything from informal gatherings to official events,” she said. Marshall also said it is not clear yet how the former Cambridge Trust office space would figure in the plan.
Restaurant owners said they were cautiously optimistic Harvard would still find a place for them in the renovated building.
“I really appreciate the need for a viable student campus center and applaud Harvard's decision to move ahead on this much needed project,” wrote Penn. “Needless to say, we are concerned about the future of Al's in our present location.”
Whereas GSAS personnel were involved in the “planning process for the announcement,” according to Marshall, the Holyoke Center business owners said they were not.
If given the option, the owners of both the sandwich shop and the pizzeria said they hope their businesses will feature in the plans for the student center. Al’s opened in March 2011, and Oggi Gourmet has been a staple in the Holyoke Arcade for even longer.
“In the last seven years, I’ve been the longest one in there,” said Welch. “So what I’d love to see them do is just integrate us more into student activities and make our business better and help it grow.”
Welch said he believes that representatives from Harvard will be speaking with the Holyoke Center business owners to hear their visions for the new center. Penn said he hopes that Harvard will be willing to work with the restaurants so they can remain in business, especially during the potentially disruptive construction period.
“I’m excited, I’m curious, I’m nervous,” said Welch. “As a business owner, when you see this magnitude of change, you want to be a part of it.”
Marshall, the University spokesperson, did not comment on where the GSAS offices would be relocated when renovation begins in 2016, but said that the school’s officials “will continue to be embedded in the process as it advances.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Student Life approved 31 student organizations at its meeting last week, among them a group for first-generation college students, the group that puts on the spring fashion show “Eleganza,” and two groups supporting students in the bisexual, gay, lesbian, trangender, and queer community.
The approved groups, which must still complete required training on Nov. 22 and Nov. 25 before they become officially recognized student organizations, represent an array of interests. Some produce publications, others are dedicated to academic endeavors, and still others perform community service.
After last week’s meeting, Undergraduate Council President Tara Raghuveer ’14, who sits on the Committee, welcomed the increased group activity and denied that it followed efforts at resume padding.
“I’m always an advocate for students who have a passion and want to start a group about that passion to do that,” Raghuveer said. “I don’t like the way the discussion is framed whereby people talk about student organizations as resume builders, as just superfluous things that people like to propose in order to be a founder. In some cases that might be true, but in my experience that’s the exception as opposed to the rule.”
One newly approved organization that members of the Committee highlighted in interviews after the meeting is the Harvard College First Generation Student Union. “I think it’s a wonderful group,” Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde said after the meeting. 
According to Daniel M. Lobo ’14, one of the group’s founders, the organization aims to “facilitat[e] the transition for first-generation students to college,” “[build] a community of first-gens,” and “advocat[e] for a greater institutional response to the first-gen identity.”
To gain official College recognition, aspiring organizations are required to submit applications to the Office of Student Life. Once recognized, they are allowed to apply for funding through the UC and reserve space for meetings. 
Raghuveer suggested that that administrators should reexamine the UC’s budget in light of the approval of the groups. The UC has faced increased budget constraints this fall, limiting its overall ability to fund student groups, including club sports teams.
“It is a disservice, I think, to approve a student group and tell them that as a recognized student group they qualify to apply for funding, and then they go and apply for funding and we just aren’t able to fund them at the amount that they need,” Raghuveer said. “Especially as a new group, that really impacts their ability to grow and institutionalize.”
More than twice as many student groups were credentialed last week than were in fall 2012. Among the 15 organizations registered last fall was Harvard College Munch, the kinky sex discussion group whose approval generated national media attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the passage of a student referendum in support of fossil fuel divestment last spring, the Harvard Law School student government called for action on the issue in a pair of letters delivered to University President Drew G. Faust and Law School Dean Martha L. Minow Thursday afternoon.
Lisa M. Lana, president of the Law School Student Representative Board, wrote the letters to Faust and Minow calling upon the Harvard community to “take responsibility for the social and political repercussions of its investment in fossil fuels.” As of Monday night, neither Faust nor Minow had responded to the letters.
In her letter to Faust, Lana mentioned Faust’s absence at a previous forum on divestment, asking that she “engage with students now on this important issue.”
“We’re hoping to join the conversation, and we’re calling on the president to at least engage in conversation with the students about this,” Lana said. “We’re hoping for at least the president to see that we are on board with this movement.”
Through a spokesperson, Faust declined to comment and referred The Crimson to a letter she wrote to the Harvard community in October to reaffirm and explain the University’s stance against fossil fuel divestment.
“I, as well as members of our Corporation Committee on Shareholder Responsibility, have benefited from a number of conversations in recent months with students who advocate divestment from fossil fuel companies,” Faust wrote in the letter. “While I share their belief in the importance of addressing climate change, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise."
In her letter to Minow, Lana asked the Dean to support the student body “in our efforts to divest University funds from fossil fuel companies.” Minow did not respond to a request for comment.
The letters were inspired by a referendum conducted by the SRB last spring. In a poll that represented approximately 40 percent of the Law School student body, 67 percent of voters supported an initiative that called for the University “to immediately freeze any new investment in fossil fuel companies and divest from all ownership of the top 200 publicly traded fossil fuel companies within five years.”
In both letters, Lana included information about the referendum and the evolution of divestment at Harvard, drawing connections between the fossil fuel divestment movement and Harvard’s previous decisions to divest. These decisions included divesting from tobacco corporations in the 1990s as well as certain companies tied to South African apartheid and genocide in Sudan.
Jacob E. Lipton, a third-year student at the Law School who is involved in the divestment movement that spearheaded the referendum, said that while he hopes the letters will inspire action from the University, he doubts that they will.
“The dream would be that Dean Minow would come out and say that it’s the position of Harvard Law School that it supports divestment,” he said. “That’s unlikely.”
Nonetheless, Lipton said that he remains optimistic about the divestment movement at large.
“This is just a first stage, and every divest movement from apartheid to tobacco have originally been met by a lot of opposition from the administration and then become successful,” Lipton said. “I think students are going to continue to press on and finish this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mother of Trayvon Martin, the Florida teenager whose killing by a neighborhood-watch volunteer last year sparked a national outcry over racial profiling, self-defense laws, and gun violence, urged Harvard Law School students to use their educations to reform the legal system during a talk Monday.
Martin’s mother, Sybrina Fulton, and two of her family’s attorneys, Daryl D. Parks and Benjamin L. Crump, spoke to students in the class Harvard Law School 2214: “Race and Justice: The Wire.” The course examines the legal proceedings in the HBO drama “The Wire,” a crime drama set in Baltimore, while also delving into broader discussions of race and the law.
The two-hour-long talk, before a packed audience at Austin Hall, centered on 17-year-old Martin, who was shot and killed in February 2012 in Sanford, Fla. by volunteer neighborhood watch leader George Zimmerman. Zimmerman, who said he fired his gun in self defense, was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter on July 13, igniting nationwide protests.
Fulton and Crump both discussed racial profiling, which they said caused Martin’s death and allowed Zimmerman to walk free.
“It was bad that George Zimmerman profiled Trayvon Martin,” Crump said. “It was far worse that our institution of criminal justice profiled Trayvon Martin.”
Fulton said that while Martin was her son, his story has implications for others—especially young people.
“Today it is my family,” Fulton said. “Tomorrow it may be yours. If we allow people to discriminate, to cause harm and kill our children because of the color of their skin, what’s next?”
Crump also discussed what he sees as the broad ramifications of the case, including what he called the “insanity of the stand-your-ground concept,” which, he said, is “getting ridiculously out of hand.”
Stand-your-ground laws, which are currently on the books in many states, generally allow a person to use deadly force without attempting to retreat, if he or she believes it necessary to avoid mortal danger.
Crump cited multiple cases in which stand-your-ground laws have resulted in the death of innocent citizens.
Parks added that these laws also facilitate an environment where people take the law into their hands.
“What we’re dealing with is a mindset,” he said. “We’re fighting the mentality of people who want to pull guns.”
In addition to discussing her son, Fulton addressed the law school students directly about their future careers.
“It’s just not good enough to have a degree,” she said. “What are you going to do to make a difference once you have that piece of paper in your hand?”
Fulton said that her family’s case could serve as motivation for students to use their degrees to help abolish stand-your-ground laws.
“I want to try to merge my purpose with your purpose,” Fulton said. “It’s important that you understand how I feel as a mother, as a parent, as a person, as an American.”
Law students at the event said that Fulton’s message resonated with them.
“I may not remember everything I learn in all my [law] classes, but I will always remember [Fulton] telling me to do something better with my degree than sticking it on the wall of some fancy office,” said Law School student Sarah R. Gersten.
The event also included two performances by vocalists from the Berklee College of Music, who invited the audience to join in song. Cambridge Mayor Henrietta J. Davis presented Fulton with a key to the city, and a member of the Boston City Council, Charles C. Yancey, read a resolution thanking Fulton for raising awareness of Martin’s case in Boston.

Voting on the Undergraduate Council referenda questions opened today, giving students the opportunity to voice their support or opposition for propsals that range from making gender neutral housing available throughout Harvard College to asking the administration to endorse comprehensive immigration reform.
We at Flyby think the ballot is missing a few things. Here are some proposals that are almost as important to Harvard student life:
 
1. Do you support or oppose requiring that HUDS serve carnival cookies in the dining hall at every meal, including breakfast?Does this even need to go on the ballot? Obviously we support it.
 
2. Do you support or oppose making No-Shave November mandatory for all men on campus?Bringing attention to men’s prostate health is a good thing. Plus, maybe if the freshman guys look older, we can finally make it into the Owl! And, as the Red Sox have proven, winners grow beards.
 
3. Do you support or oppose keeping Lamont open all night Friday and Saturday?There’s no feeling of shame like getting kicked out of a library on a weekend night. Isn’t it enough that most of us can’t get into Final Clubs? We just want to belong somewhere.
4.  Do you support or oppose a shuttle from the Union dorms to the Yard?Does Harvard really expect students in Union dorms to walk three minutes to class? Seriously, come on.
 
5.  Do you support or oppose making it mandatory for students to receive free bacon for attending sporting events?This may seem ridiculous, but it's a foolproof way to raise attendance at athletic contests. Just ask Kansas State.
6. Do you support or oppose the extension of dining hall hours for dinner past 7:15 p.m.?Wait, this is a serious proposal that would make the lives of most students more convenient….hmm.

UPDATED: Nov. 18, 2013 at 12:24 p.m.
Students eager to cast their vote for the UC presidential elections early Monday morning were not greeted with the names and platforms of the UC candidates or the pro/con statements for the referendum questions. Instead the website notified students that voting would start at 12:01 p.m. on November 18, that the election had not started...and that students should check out the official website for Madonna (this suggestion coming hyperlinked and in lowercase: “(while you wait, try this)”.)
 
While we at Flyby certainly applaud the UC’s choice in music, we question whether the Council might have better served us as voters by linking to candidate platforms, referenda questions, or heck, even the UC website rather than gratuitous photos of the Queen of Pop.
Now if turnout is low in this week’s election we’ll know who to blame. The Queen of Pop.
 (Alternatively: Might this be a harbinger for a Madonna Yardfest appearance?)

It was so hard to choose the best comments on Kim Kardashian’s Instagram post of her hubbie Kanye West speaking at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design on Sunday. Each comment was special in its own way. Almost everyone had something to say about the College Dropout rapper’s appearance. Here are some highlights from the Instacomments:
“Harvard went from bill gates speaking to this idiot? Wow ! Thanks obama”We’re so glad this commenter pointed out the obvious: Obama lined up Kanye’s speaking gig at the GSD. Now that we think about it, he probably lines up most of Kanye’s events.
“This is a joke right? Harvard?u mean Harvard?”Many comments echoed what this Instauser put so eloquently. Yes, in fact, Kim did mean Harvard. Kanye was here dropping words of wisdom. As reported by Us Weekly, the rapper said: "Just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be 'architected.’”
“Kim i don’t understand why You Chose satan over Chris humphries”No one wants to give Kimye a break. Can’t we just be happy for them and kill the satanic references?
“Someone should teach him how to treat people and get him anger management class”Kanye’s notorious angry antics come back to haunt him when he is speaking about something as safe as design.
“Damn all this hate, y’all must be mad you didn’t get accepted to Harvard or something”This one speaks to us on a real deep level.
“How did North already land a guest speaker gig?”Ah, we were waiting for North to make an appearance in the comments! How long will it be before NW has an Insta of her own?
 “love you so much kim!”Unclear if this user actually looked at the picture before she decided to leave a comment. For once in Kim’s Instalife this picture isn’t about her.
 From Kimye haters to fanatics, Instausers around the globe really pour their hearts out in the comments sections of Kim’s Instagrams no matter what. (And Lauren is clearly obsessed with Instagram.)
