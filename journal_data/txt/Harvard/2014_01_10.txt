Media magnate and Harvard Law School graduate Sumner M. Redstone ’44 will give the school $10 million to endow a series of fellowships for graduating students who wish to pursue careers in public service, the school announced on Thursday.
Redstone donated $1 million to the College and Law School in 2010 to support public service among students, $500,000 of which was used to establish fellowships for ten graduating students to work in public service. Redstone’s latest donation—the largest ever given in the name of public service to HLS—will fully endow the fellowship in his name.
Yearly, ten graduates will receive funding as Redstone Fellows to work in the “public interest,” where paid internships or full-time positions are difficult to secure, according to Steven Oliveira, associate dean of development and alumni relations at the Law School.
Since the 2008 recession, it has become increasingly financially difficult for nonprofit organizations and government agencies to recruit students and offer competitive salaries to law school graduates, Oliveira said in an interview.
In the press release, Redstone emphasized his wish that graduates enter the public sector.
“The need for public service today is greater than ever, demanding innovation and progress to make a fundamental impact…and it is my hope that Redstone Fellows will continue to put their intellectual tools to the best possible use in building a better world,” Redstone said.
Law School Dean Martha L. Minow praised Redstone’s gift in the press release, saying that it would allow the school to “enormously strengthen” its ability to promote public service.
“[T]hanks to Sumner’s transformational new gift, we can look forward to even greater accomplishments from future generations of Redstone Fellows, and to the difference they will make in providing access to justice for people who could not otherwise afford it,” Minow said.
The donation was given through the Sumner M. Redstone Charitable Foundation, which has donated over $170 million to philanthropic causes, including the Boston University School of Law, Boston Latin School, and the Global Poverty Project.
After earning his law degree at Harvard, Redstone himself worked as a lawyer in the public sector. He served as a law secretary with the U.S. Court of Appeals and later as a special assistant to then-Attorney General Tom C. Clark. He eventually went on to take over his father’s movie theater chain, National Amusements, and create a career in the media and communications industry.
 
Today, Redstone and his family own majority stakes in Viacom and CBS Corporation. Redstone serves as executive chairman of both companies’ boards. According to the press release, he has been a frequent lecturer at the Law School since earning his degree in 1947.

UPDATED: January 14, 2014, at 3:17 p.m.
Eldo Kim ’16 was released from federal custody on Dec. 18, but the Harvard sophomore charged in connection with a finals period bomb scare that put Harvard on high alert continues to await a formal grand jury indictment, his attorney Allison D. Burroughs said this week. 
According to Burroughs, after Kim was “charged by complaint” and arrested on Dec. 17 for allegedly sending several emails the day before saying that he had placed bombs in two of four campus buildings, the U.S. government is allowed thirty days to lodge formal charges via a grand jury.
Burroughs said that the delay in Kim’s case was not out of the ordinary or the result of any party’s inaction, but simply the usual proceeding in cases like this.
“It’s like a train that hasn’t reached the next station,” Burroughs said in a phone interview on Monday.
If convicted under the federal bomb hoax statute, Kim could be sentenced to up to five years of imprisonment, three years of probationary release, and a $250,000 fine, though a federal prosecutor said during the Dec. 18 pretrial hearing that the prosecution was working with Kim’s lawyers to explore alternatives to detention.
Kim was released from custody after the hearing, as he and two court-appointed guardians, his sister and uncle, co-signed a $100,000 bail bond. He will not be required to pay any part of the bond unless he violates the terms of that release, which included not returning to Harvard’s campus without the express permission of the University and the accompaniment of one of his guardians as well as that he remain in Massachusetts.
While Burroughs would not confirm Kim’s current whereabouts or whether he had returned to Harvard’s campus to retrieve his belongings, she said that “to the extent that [Kim] has wanted access, [Harvard administrators] have granted it.”
Burroughs praised Harvard’s conduct in the proceedings thus far, calling the University’s actions involving Kim “quite fair and reasonable.”
As for what formal role the University will ultimately play, Burroughs said that due to the preliminary nature of the proceedings it is still unclear how Harvard will fit into the process, though she added that she thought the University would likely be treated as a victim in the case, entitling it to certain notifications as the case proceeded.
“There isn’t really a role for them at this point,” she said, adding that “the only person who has a role right now is the government.”
Burroughs said that her “understanding is that once the criminal case is resolved, Harvard will take its own disciplinary actions.” Such action would likely come in the form of a case in the College’s Administrative Board. A spokesperson for the College declined to comment on the matter.
Federal public defender Ian Gold, who previously served as Kim's attorney, said in an interview with the Huffington Post in December that Kim had expressed remorse for his actions. Gold has subsequently ceased to represent Kim. Neither he nor the Boston U.S. District Attorney’s Office responded to repeated requests for comment for this article.
Kim was arrested on Dec. 17 after being interviewed by authorities in his Quincy House residence the night before. According to an affidavit filed by an FBI agent present for the interview, Kim said that he issued the Dec. 16 bomb threat—which was sent to the Harvard University Police Department, University administrators, and the president of The Crimson—to avoid a final examination.
Based on the affidavit, which states that Kim was scheduled to take an exam in Emerson Hall at 9 a.m. on Dec. 16, and on an email sent by Kim over the Quincy House email list on Dec. 14, Kim is thought to have been enrolled in Government 1368: “The Politics of American Education.” Government professor Paul E. Peterson, who teaches the course, declined to comment on the case.
The threat alleged that there were explosives placed in two of four campus buildings: the Science Center, as well as Emerson, Sever, and Thayer halls. All four buildings were evacuated and access to Harvard Yard restricted as local, state, and federal law enforcement swept campus. The evacuations meant that numerous final exams scheduled to take place in the buildings were rescheduled or cancelled.
After a roughly five-hour search, law enforcement officials declared the buildings safe, having found no explosives.

CORRECTION: Jan. 14, 2014
An earlier version of this story and the caption of the photo accompanying it incorrectly identified the employment status of the attorney currently representing Eldo Kim ’16. In fact, Allison D. Burroughs is an attorney in private practice not a public defender.

Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15 and Joshua P. Zoffer ’14 emerged victorious in the 34th World Universities Debating Championship last week, becoming the first Harvard team to win the competition, called “Worlds,” in over 20 years.
Students from over 300 universities competed in the prestigious international tournament, which is hosted annually by the World Universities Debating Council and was held in Chennai, India from Dec. 28 to Jan. 3.
Zoffer and Sprung-Keyser won after debating the adoption of “radical free-market policies” in the final round of the contest.
“When we heard the topic, we were ecstatic,” Zoffer, who was still out of the country, wrote in an email to The Crimson.
“Economics is their turf,” said Cormac A. Early ’09, a former Harvard debater who helped train the team. “It’s almost like they had home-field advantage.”
Sprung-Keyser, an economics concentrator, had recently researched Indian labor markets, and Zoffer studies economic history. In the final debate, they discussed labor market reforms, foreign direct investment, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises, among other issues.
“We were happy that we got to talk about something we really care about,” Sprung-Keyser said.
Tournament participants compete in the British parliamentary debate format, which, according to the team’s coach and Kennedy School student Julia L. Fetherston, differs vastly from formats popular in the United States.
“Preparing a team for Worlds is like helping an NFL player switch to soccer or rugby—within six months,” she said.
Contestants are assigned topics fifteen minutes before debate begins, and according to Fetherston, this year’s tournament featured topics that ranged from cosmetic surgery to drug policy. The diversity of possible topics, she said, demands “a wide general knowledge that makes the format particularly challenging—and the wonderful performances even more impressive.”
Sprung-Keyser and Zoffer began preparing for the tournament last year by reading about current events, watching videos of past debates, and competing in tournaments at Yale University, the University of Toronto, and the University of Cambridge.
They also brought in former debaters like Early, who had competed at Worlds four times and reached the final round twice, for practice rounds. Early, a former Crimson editorial editor, said that he advised the duo “to be a little more relaxed when speaking and to dig deeper” into important arguments.
“In Worlds, there’s less of a premium on making a lot of arguments—spitballing and hoping things will stick—and more of a premium on speaking well,” he said.
Fetherston said Sprung-Keyser and Zoffer had focused particularly on improving their performance in the “opening government” position, which entails speaking first and arguing in favor of the given motion. They were assigned to this position in the final round.
Though their formal preparation for Worlds spanned a year, both Sprung-Keyser and Zoffer said that their preparation truly commenced several years ago, when they began their debate careers.
While Sprung-Keyser, whose father was a former Harvard debater, began debating in elementary school, Zoffer started debate as a freshman in high school.
“My parents got a note home about it and thought it was the perfect activity for a very argumentative fourteen-year-old,” Zoffer said.
Both debaters attribute a large part of their success to their team dynamic.
“We debate very similarly, and when it comes to competition we click extraordinarily well,” Sprung-Keyser said. “We complement each other in a technical way. Josh’s job is specific argument generation, while I focus on the strategy of the round as a whole.”
Zoffer added that he and Sprung-Keyser are “incredibly close as partners and friends,” a quality important for this style of tournament.
“Winning a tournament like Worlds requires being with your partner almost 24/7 for five days, so it’s an intense emotional experience that requires a strong bond,” he said.
The world champions both described earning the title as a “surreal” experience.
“Even if you have the skill and potential, you need so much help along the way, and Josh and I are extremely lucky in that regard. We’ve had the support of phenomenal coaches, former Harvard debaters, and teammates,” Sprung-Keyser said.
“We’re really happy and proud to bring the championship to Harvard—and really humbled.”

Jazz musician Herbert “Herbie” J. Hancock was named the 2014 Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry earlier this week. The professorship, previously held by the likes of poet T.S. Eliot, Class of 1910, composer Leonard Bernstein ’39, and most recently author Orhan Pamuk, is awarded periodically to an individual with notable accomplishments in the arts.
“[Hancock] is both a legend and a pioneer,” Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center and a member of the 2014 Norton committee, wrote in an email to The Crimson. “It is no exaggeration to say that his influence on jazz, and a range of affiliated musical traditions, has been utterly transformative.”
A prolific composer and former member of the Miles Davis Quintet, Hancock has explored a number of musical genres, including electronic jazz, R&B, and funk. With his band, The Headhunters, he produced the first album in the jazz genre to go platinum, and throughout his musical career, he has won 14 Grammy Awards as well as an Academy Award for his score of the 1986 film Round Midnight. He was recently named the Creative Chair for Jazz of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and also serves as chairman of the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz.
As Norton Professor, Hancock will deliver six lectures in a series entitled “The Ethics of Jazz.” The lectures, which will take place in February and March, will be hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center and each will take place at 4 p.m. in Sanders Theatre. Hancock will be in residence at Harvard for the duration of his lectureship.
In an interview with The Crimson, Hancock said that his lectures would center on life lessons and the experiences that he has had working with others. His lecture topics include cultural diplomacy, Buddhism and creativity, and innovation and new technologies.
“There will be a lot of stories about things that I have observed, that I have learned from others,” he said. “I want to share some of those experiences with the people who attend the lectures, because, perhaps, it will have significance to their lives and hopefully they will gain something from it that they can carry with them.”
Hancock said that he hopes that the lectures spark dialogue and critical thinking among attendees.
“I dont want them to walk out and they close the doors of their thinking on anything on the issues that I bring up in my lectures,” he said. “I hope it is something they can carry with them over their lives.”
Professors and other figures in the humanities scene at Harvard said that they were pleased by the appointment of a jazz musician to the esteemed post, which has hosted a range of figures from literature, music, and the fine arts since its inception in 1925.
“He was an obvious choice,” said Steven H. Biel, executive director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, adding that it was the appropriate time for a musician to be named Norton lecturer. “I am excited to hear from him in terms of what he has to say about his work and also to hear from him musically.”
Music professor Ingrid T. Monson and Music Department chair Alexander Rehding, both members of the selection committee, said that they considered several individuals for the professorship and sought out a jazz musician, a departure from the classical composers often chosen for the post.
“He is living history. He embodies a really important part of jazz in this country, so we are hoping to get a sense of his musicality and his humanity that he will include in his lectures,” Rehding said, adding that he hopes that performances from Hancock will become “an integral part” of the lecture series.
Monson and Rehding also commented on Hancock’s humanitarian efforts and the global perspective of his music. Hancock was named a Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2011.
“There is a very strong idealistic streak in his thinking,” Rehding said. “It is a big part of his persona, so I think it is something that we can look forward to [in the lectures].”
Hancock said that his humanitarian endeavors and pursuit of world peace manifest themselves in his music and will also come up in his lectures.
“I am not fundamentally a musician, I am fundamentally a human being,” he said. “As a human being, one of the areas that I focus on is how I can use music...an avenue that draws the attention of people [to] address somebody’s issues and to illuminate the solutions some of the issues that people have to deal with.”
Hancock’s first lecture, “The Wisdom of Miles Davis,” will take place Monday, Feb. 3. Tickets are free and available through the Harvard Box Office.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From time to time, it seems people tend to forget that Jeremy Lin’s ‘13 main employment commitment is being basketball player, not a walking billboard. A nationally released documentary film about your life story and a global Adidas endorsement contract will do that.
Linsanity and its commercialism aside, Lin continues to thrive as a point guard for the Houston Rockets. Though he may not be the “superstar” Adidas claimed to have signed, the 6’3”, 25 year old has been consistent from the get-go.
Lin lost the starting point guard battle to second-year upstart and 2013 postseason surprise Patrick Beverley at the beginning of the season, but he wasn’t fazed. The Palo Alto native shot 49 percent from the field in the first month of the season, averaging 15-plus points per game. He had back-to-back 30-point games against the Raptors and 76ers.
Often coming off the bench to give star shooting guard James Harden some rest, the former Crimson star quickly became the de facto leading scorer of the second line and arguably the best floor spacing partner for center Dwight Howard, who likes to roam between the two blocks when he’s not setting screens.
But then the injury bug crept up. After suffering a knee sprain and contusion on November 29th against the Jazz, Lin fell out of the starting lineup (he had been starting in the place of an injured James Harden at the time). He returned two weeks later but didn’t look the same. A game later, Lin was back on the pine in a suit and tie after suffering from back spasms.
In his first game back, Lin dropped 20 points on 10 shots against the Dallas Mavericks and went on to post eight assists on Christmas Day against the San Antonio Spurs. Since then, he has struggled with his shot at times, going 2-of-9 from the field against the Oklahoma City Thunder and 4-of-12 against the Lakers on Wednesday.
Though the shots haven’t been falling consistently of late, Lin has put his best foot forward on defense after getting benched in the fourth quarter against the Knicks in the Rockets first game of 2014. He had a plus/minus rating of positive 14 against the Lakers in the next matchup, holding opposing point guard Kendall Marshall to five points on 2-of-13 shooting.
With Beverley out for the next month with a broken right hand, Lin has the chance to step up and assert his role as the best point guard the Rockets put on the court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, CONN.--In big games, the Harvard men's basketball team might want to change its halftime routine.
After losing a 14-point lead at Colorado in November, the Crimson watched its five-point advantage over Connecticut disappear during the final 20 minutes in Storrs, Conn., Wednesday. The Huskies opened the second half with a 22-10 run to grab the lead and held on for a 61-56 win. Harvard was outscored by a combined 30 second-half points against Connecticut and the Buffaloes.
 
Maybe Harvard has been rattled playing offense in front of large student sections at big schools. Maybe the Crimson’s lack of depth due to injury catches up to it in the second half. Maybe it’s just an issue of small sample size. Whatever it may be, Harvard cannot let the trend continue.
 
Last year, the Crimson closed big games. Against Princeton in league play and New Mexico in the NCAA Tournament, Harvard won the second half. It’ll have to start doing more of that against top-tier opponents if it wants to repeat last year’s success.
 
PLAYING WES-LESS
 
The biggest moment of Wednesday's game probably came before tip-off, when Harvard’s leading scorer, junior wing Wesley Saunders, was ruled out for the game with knee pain. He participated in the morning shootaround but ultimately could not play. How long Saunders will be out remains to be seen, but his impact on the team was evident in his absence.
 
The most obvious change was to Harvard’s rotation, which only utilized eight men while Connecticut rotated 10 players through. Without Saunders in the backcourt, sophomore Siyani Chambers and co-captain Brandyn Curry shouldered the biggest load with 38 minutes each on the floor.
 
Curry's 38 minutes matched the combined amount he had played over the previous six weeks. He missed a month of action with a achilles injury, and Harvard coach Tommy Amaker had been slowly upping his minutes since. Amaker had no choice but to ride Curry Wednesday.
 
Curry shot just 2-of-12 from the field, though he did come up with six assists and five rebounds. On the other side of the court, he was often tasked with marking Shabazz Napier, who finished with a team-high 18. Last year, Saunders held Napier scoreless for the first 32 minutes of the game, and the Huskies guard finished with just six points.
 
“Did [Curry's stamina] concern me somewhat? Yeah,” Amaker said, “But I think our guys are in pretty good shape, and certainly Brandyn has worked himself back to being able to play extended minutes.”
 
Chambers, on the other hand, thrived in Saunders’ absence. Looking to shoot more than usual, he finished with a game-high 21 points. Chambers looked like the best player on the court for lengthy stretches even though Connecticut’s starting backcourt is made up of two top-15 point guards.
 
"When Wesley went down, we were just going to do it as a team," Chambers said. "Somebody was going to step up."
 
That somebody ended up being Chambers himself. His performance was a big improvement over his last trip to Connecticut, when he had more turnovers (five) than points (three).
 
Harvard’s third starting guard, Laurent Rivard, came up big down the stretch. A four-point play followed by an old-fashioned three-point play on a put-back kept the Crimson alive in the final minute, but Harvard failed to get the potentially game-tying shot off in its final possession.
 
Ultimately, Saunders’ absence led to an odd combination of revelations. The offense sputtered at times, particularly late in the shot clock when Saunders often makes things happen by himself. Instead of that, the Crimson settled for 22 three-pointers (eight more than its season average) and shot just 36 percent from the field.
 
Yet, Harvard also showed it did not need Saunders to keep up with one of the best teams it will face all year. Chambers and Rivard stepped up offensively, while aggressive team defense helped the Crimson overcome the loss of its best defensive stopper. Assuming Saunders returns to full health soon, that bodes well for the Crimson’s future.
 
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS
 
When Harvard’s schedule, including a trip to a weak Alaska Shootout, was released, two games stuck out as opportunities for a quality win: at Colorado and at Connecticut. Win one if not both and the Crimson could make a serious run at a single-digit seed and potentially an at-large bid if it does not win the Ivy League title. Harvard won neither.
Now, the Crimson’s March fate could be determined by how much the selection committee values the way the Crimson lost, dropping close games without junior forward Kenyatta Smith in either game and without Saunders against Connecticut.
 In the past, committee members have said they look at the ways teams handle adversity. That should give Harvard fans hope, but the Crimson sure could have made the numbers guessing-game a lot simpler.

The No. 13 Harvard men’s volleyball team could not follow up yesterday’s win against Laval University in Quebec. The Crimson (1-2) dropped its second exhibition match across the border against the host Red and Gold, 3-1.
Although Laval came out on top in the first match, 25-15, Harvard was able to come back and battle in the second set to win, 25-17.
The real challenge in the match came in the third set, when the teams battled to a 33-35 finish, with the Red and Gold ultimately taking the set.
The final set of the game also went over the usual 25-point cap, with Laval winning the game, 27-25, in the fourth set.
The White brothers led Harvard’s offense. Junior DJ White paced the Crimson with 14 kills, while freshman Casey White added 10. DJ White also recorded 13 digs on the floor, giving him a double-double for the night. Freshman setter Nick Bendell aided the team with 35 assists. The Crimson hit .181 overall.
Sophomore Branden Clemens added to the defensive effort for Harvard with 13 digs on the night. Bendell contributed 12 throughout the game, and co-captain Chris Gibbons dug 11.  Harvard recorded more digs than Laval, with 64 compared to its opponent’s 58.
The Crimson’s blocking game was led by junior Caleb Zimmick with four, and senior Kyle Rehkemper and Clemens recorded three and two, respectively.  Throughout the game, Harvard was able to out block its opponent, with 12 on the night to the Red and Gold’s eight.
The Red and Gold did out hit the Crimson, recording 54 kills to Harvard’s 51. For Laval, Oliver Jannini led the offense with 26. Sylvain Beneix added 12.
Vincent Thibault-B posted a game-high 50 assists, helping Laval’s offense to record its 130 attacks throughout the game. The Red and Gold hit .238 overall.
On the defensive end, Thibault-B led the team with 15 digs, followed Beneix, who had 12, and Jannini with 11.

Ten years after having competed in his final collegiate match, Harvard wrestler Jesse Jantzen ’04 has been selected as one of the newest inductees to the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association’s Hall of Fame.
Jantzen had plenty of success with the Crimson, compiling a 132-13 record during his tenure with the team. He was named first team All-Ivy in each of his four seasons, while also being named an All-American three times. The star capped his career by earning the Ivy League Player of the Year title after his senior season.
In 2004, Jantzen cemented his legacy at Harvard, winning an NCAA championship at 149 pounds. The title was the second in school history and the first since John Harkness ’38 took the crown in his senior season many decades prior.
The Crimson’s most recent champion hails from Shoreham, New York, where he also had huge success as a wrestler in high school. Jantzen won six league titles, claimed six county crowns, and became the first wrestler in New York history to win four state championships. He recorded a 221-3 record at Shoreham High, winning 157 consecutive matches to close his high school career.
After graduating from Harvard, Jantzen continued to wrestle at a high level. In 2005, he won a gold medal at the World University Games in Turkey and placed fourth in the World Team Trials. A year later, Jantzen returned to the Crimson as an assistant coach while continuing his own wrestling career.
The induction ceremony will take place Sunday, March 9 at 3:45pm at the University of Pennsylvania. The service will precede this year’s EIWA Championships at The Palestra.

Though he won’t be playing in any frostbite-inducing playoff games anytime soon, Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ‘05 can feel at least a little more confident about his job prospects.
Filling in for injured starter Jake Locker in Week 4 against the New York Jets, Fitzpatrick inherited a Titans team that struggled on both sides of the ball, though most of it was beyond Fitzpatrick’s control. The former Harvard star guided the NFL squad to a 7-9 record and a second place finish in the AFC South division.
Despite having a three game streak of passer ratings above 100 and no interceptions, the Titans went 1-2 and fell out of serious playoff contention.
Regardless, Fitz’s best game came mid-December against the Arizona Cardinals, a slugfest that saw him throw 58 passes, and complete 36 of them. He had four passing touchdowns, but the bad luck Titans fell once again.
On paper, the 6’2”, 223 pounder’s credentials for the season look pretty good. He finished the year with the best completion percentage and second best passer rating of his nine-year career. Coming away with more touchdowns (14) than interceptions (12) on the year was also impressive for an NFL backup.
But that’s just it; though Fitz posted better than career average numbers, a 3-7 team record with him starting under center isn’t good enough to supplant a healthy Locker next season.
It was a solid performance from the former Ivy League Player of the Year—not quite good enough to warrant the full-time position but likely enough to keep him on an NFL team’s payroll next year as a solid backup option.
At the end of the season, former Titans head coach Mike Munchak (who was fired largely in part for his reluctance to make changes) was quoted by ESPN.com saying, “This year, we were right there. We just got to find, get a few closures. We just need to find a few more guys to help us close out games and we’ll be in great shape.”
You don’t have to be a Harvard grad to figure out that a quarterback with a 3-7 starting record isn’t one of those close-out guys.
