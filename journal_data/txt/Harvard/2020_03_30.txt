After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Whether you love her or hate her, it is hard to deny that Hillary Clinton has lived a fascinating life as one of the most recognizable women in American politics. In a new four-hour docu-series on Hulu, Clinton’s life is examined in grueling detail — from her childhood to her career as a lawyer to her life as first lady, senator, Secretary of State, and presidential candidate. Hours of interview footage with both Hillary and Bill Clinton, former president Barack Obama, and many other political insiders make this series replete with insight and reflection. However, given its release on the eve of another presidential election, the series forces viewers to confront what good it does to continue dwelling on 2016 as we approach Nov. 3.
The documentary features exclusive interview footage with a demure and reflective Clinton, with clips carefully chosen to demonstrate her awareness of some of the fatal flaws of her campaign. These serve, effectively, as a video adaptation of her 2017 memoir “What Happened.” Clinton’s commentary leaves no doubt in the viewer’s mind that she is sharp-witted and intelligent. She gracefully acknowledges the way that confusion around possible scandals with her emails, Benghazi, and Whitewater fostered skepticism about her trustworthiness. Despite the questionable foundation of the allegations against her, she reflected that “even when something is disproved, people remember that the allegation was made,” a claim made all the more believable by the numerous hostile news clips spliced between Clinton’s interviews. Each one further paints her as the victim of the media’s scrutiny.
Bafflingly, Clinton discusses Bernie Sanders, her Democratic primary opponent, with far more ire than Donald Trump. In a clip that has gained traction on Twitter, Clinton comments that “nobody likes [Sanders], nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done, he was a career politician … [his message] was all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.” The documentary’s choice to showcase this resentment felt ridiculous and misplaced, especially given its later discussion of Clinton’s push for healthcare reform in the ’90s, which is not significantly dissimilar from Sanders’ advocacy of a universal healthcare system. The documentary’s choice to highlight this resentment feels misplaced, especially when one considers the fundamental similarity between Clinton’s and Sanders’ ideologies. One has to question the editorial role played by the producers, and whether or not the choice was deliberate political calculus.
Cinematically, the show diverges little from the documentary form — fluid and insightful, but unremarkable. Footage in each episode oscillates between the arc of Clinton’s early career and her 2016 presidential campaign, positioning her run for president as the culminating moment of her life’s work. While this structure runs the risk of feeling disjointed, each episode demands more of the viewer as a result. The choice allows for the stifling discomfort of rewatching the chaos of 2016 non-stop from beginning to end, an experience somewhat akin to watching embarrassing videos of your middle school self.
But where “Hillary” most excels is in posing thought-provoking questions about life as a public servant. Shots that rapidly change between Clinton’s interviews, her media portrayals, and her interactions with constituents highlight, to great effect, the political balancing act of trying to please as many people as possible while remaining true to one’s values. As the first female presidential nominee of a major party, Clinton is undoubtedly a trailblazer, and the viewer is forced to grapple with the role of trailblazers in creating change and how easily those pioneers can be demonized. Footage of Clinton’s constituents questioning her choices about her career, her marriage, and even her smile provides clear evidence of how Clinton was vilified for her motivations and personal choices. The documentary makes clear how toxic life in the public eye can be, while not forcing the viewer to feel sympathetic to Clinton’s personal struggles.
Despite the show’s insights, it is hard to ignore the way “Hillary” expatiates on the 2016 election. And there is little chance that fixating on Clinton’s loss is the most effective way to mobilize in 2020. Regret doesn’t win elections. As discussed in the documentary, hope, the promise of change, and the belief in a better tomorrow does. “Hillary” might be insightful in thinking about the past, but the show fails to effectively discuss causes that could help America’s future. The latter would be closer to the show that voters need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About three weeks ago, I was in Austria, teasing my friend, Jocelyn, for wearing gloves and a mask to the Viennese opera. I was feeling confident that my study abroad program at the University of Cambridge would not get canceled. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, I realize I could not have miscalculated more. I have been relegated to self-isolation in my suburban home of Glen Allen, Virginia; Cambridge indeed moved its next term online; and I don’t anticipate leaving the confines of the rudimentary routine I have established for the foreseeable future.
Understandably, in these times of unpredictability and discomfort, anxiety and stress, and generally a fear of the unknown, Americans have had to tap into a sense of community in order to follow the necessary practices to keep people healthy and safe. Just as Pearl Harbor served as a rallying cry for Americans in World War II and Sept. 11 created a similar sense of nationalist solidarity, this coronavirus has enabled President Donald Trump to declare war on the “other.”
However, in his willingness to blame China entirely for this pandemic, he’s encouraged a similarly destructive behavior in the masses. While externalizing blame is not altogether a surprising approach from our president, it is not the kind of behavior we should practice societally or individually. The vast majority of Americans — myself included — did not take this virus seriously, and in doing so, unnecessarily endangered the lives of countless more people.
When news broke of an imminent travel ban on visitors from Europe to the United States, signaling the severity of the pandemic, I still stubbornly took my flight from London to Boston instead of going straight home to my family. I refused to compromise on seeing my friends first, even though my same friend, Jocelyn, made exactly that sacrifice for the safety of herself, her friends at Harvard, and most prominently, her family. One of my best friends still decided to spend part of his spring break in Miami; others still went to the Bahamas or Puerto Rico or elsewhere to cling on to that quintessential college spring break experience. Hundreds of Harvard students still dartied and partied those final days of the on-campus semester before boarding flights to travel all across the country and world in the days after.
It is true that not all of these decisions were in our control and certainly they were not made maliciously. Indeed, when I put myself back into those scenarios of two or three weeks ago, I do not believe the U.S. administration had adequately expressed the lifestyle change necessary for the health of our community. For me personally, I was mandated to return to the States, so adding an extra stop at Harvard seemed harmless at the time, especially because the Trump administration was maintaining a relaxed approach to the spread of the virus. Students were required to leave campus with short notice, so, especially for the seniors, large group gatherings seemed like a necessary way to celebrate those last in-person moments of the spring semester, and the Harvard administration did not admonish such behavior for days, allowing the practice to become a habit. My friends who still decided to travel to their spring break destinations regret not being forced to grasp the severity of the situation earlier; they now share sentiments of recognizing the health risk they posed to themselves, one another, their families, and numerous strangers they interacted with along the way.
Yet, the lack of malicious intent does not rid us of our culpability. We can (and should!) wash our hands as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention advises, but that doesn’t mean we can necessarily wash our hands of the guilt we may feel for how we as a student body, community, and country decided to respond to this crisis. And we shouldn’t. Part of what pushed China to create a “fail-safe” system to track contagions after the SARS epidemic was a recognition and understanding of the many ways they failed themselves and one another in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak. Even if that system did indeed fail this time around, it went a long way in helping China respond where the U.S. has fallen short. Guilt is not a comfortable feeling, but externalizing blame will only set up history to repeat itself.
When I arrived back to campus, some friends decided to poke fun at how I had placed their lives and the lives of those they love in jeopardy by coming back. While I believe that was the same kind of mean-spirited and unproductive approach President Trump has taken to blame China for the pandemic that now touts the United States as its epicenter, there is an undeniable truth in the culpability they assign. I should and do apologize for the selfishness and thoughtlessness I demonstrated in returning to campus from my study abroad program in the United Kingdom. It was that kind of realization and sense of guilt that has effectively kept me at home for the past two weeks of quarantine, and that will continue to keep me social distancing until advised otherwise by trusted health experts.
President Trump may want to blame China; Americans may want to blame the Miami spring breakers; my friends may want to blame me. But, ultimately, how we individually recognize the role we play in keeping ourselves and one another safe and, potentially more importantly, how we choose to impress upon others the significance of individual action can have a true impact. We can change the course of not just the next pandemic, but how we flatten the curve on this one. It isn’t too late as long as we realize that simply washing our hands is not enough of a change in our behavior.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, my coworkers and I were notified that along with all other Dean of Student Office interns on the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion team, our work hours as Diversity Peer Educators would be reduced significantly: from around 10 hours a week to roughly 3.5 hours each week. Presumably, the justification for drastically reducing our hours, a vital source of income for many of us, is that the University is preparing for financial loss due to coronavirus. This news followed an email from Michael P. Burke, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar, earlier this week which said that Harvard would continue to pay students with on-campus jobs that could be performed remotely — which presumably would have included us and other DSO interns. Not only has Harvard continued to communicate misleading information about our job security, but the decision to cut our hours exemplifies a disregard for the financial impact of this crisis on student workers and a devaluation of the importance of our work that must be remedied.
As a New Yorker, I’ve spent the past few days watching my city become ravaged by the coronavirus. Every few hours, I am devastated to learn of yet another person in my community who is struggling to fight COVID-19. When I step outside to grab the mail or run to the pharmacy, I worry that I will catch the virus and infect my immunocompromised family members. The hospitals closest to me don’t have enough ventilators, protective equipment for their workers, and are battling increasing death rates. Amid all this anxiety about mine and my loved ones’ health, I worry about my family’s impending financial issues. The decision to cut my hours has prevented me from supporting my family and has only increased my anxiety during this tumultuous time. Other interns who have used their income throughout the school year to support their families will suffer even more than I will.
Yet, complete disregard for workers is not new for the Harvard administration. From failing to negotiate a fair contract for graduate students to initially suggesting that dining hall staff and custodial workers would be temporarily laid off after 30 days, Harvard has continued to prioritize maintaining its endowment above its workers' livelihoods. While my circumstances are not comparable to denying what may be the sole source of income for many workers, the justification has been the same: that the University does not have the resources. The insinuation that Harvard University’s $40 billion endowment, the largest for any university in the world, would be depleted by paying its student employees is preposterous.
These claims are not only outrageous, but they communicate a disregarding of the work of the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion offices including the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Harvard College Women’s Center, and my own — the Office of Diversity Education and Support. As a Diversity Peer Educator, I am trained in facilitating dialogues on issues facing Harvard students, hosting community events, and offering inclusivity training for student organizations. The DPE program has allowed me to utilize my passion for social justice to help shape the Harvard community into one that is more inclusive of our diverse student body at a time where a substantial number of students, especially students of color, do not feel that they belong. Despite increased demand for our facilitated dialogues and the importance of our trainings and consultations for student organizations, we have only been given 18 hours for the rest of the semester to continue our crucial work. Our work is an example of the “commitment to diversity” that the University continues to espouse — one that should not stop during this crisis. It is in the most difficult times that an institution's real commitments are exposed, and right now diversity education and support does not appear to be one of them.
Despite this devastating news, the DPE community is not one that can be destroyed by the administration's tone-deaf policies. When we received this news, several of my coworkers immediately offered to give up their hours to those who have a greater need for the income. The lack of empathy that the administration has exhibited to the plight of Harvard student workers is not one that is shared by my coworkers.
But just as Harvard made the right choice in changing its decision and paying workers through May, Harvard can maintain employment for all students who can work remotely, including DSO interns. They should also compensate student employees who rely on term-time employment but are unable to work, such as library workers, through a weekly stipend as Mike Burke proposed last week in a retracted email to the student body. Harvard must ensure that during a global pandemic student employees are compensated for their work so they can support themselves and their families.

With 27 Harvard affiliates now reporting positive test results for COVID-19, Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen said his office is working to coordinate with local health authorities and adapting the few in-person services it still offers in an interview Thursday.
As of Sunday evening, the number of Harvard affiliates — including University President Lawrence S. Bacow — who have reported testing positive for COVID-19 has slowly but steadily grown. Still, HUHS depends on the self-reporting of Harvard affiliates to arrive at that count.
Nguyen said HUHS responds to University affiliates who report positive test results but does not get in the way of steps, including contact tracing efforts, taken by local public health agencies.
“If they reached out and said that they were positive, we respond to them and certainly ask if they need any assistance or resources from us,” Nguyen said. “The contact investigation is the purview of the local department of public health in the jurisdiction where the person got tested. That is what the law provides for, so we don't step on their toes.”
He added that the constantly changing testing capabilities, resources, and access — as well as changing guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health — may affect when University affiliates get test results.
“One person might get tested and wait for a week to get results and then someone else might get tested three days later and they find out within two days. It is not always entirely predictable,” Nguyen said. “You will likely continue to see changes in how we deal with things and how we approach testing.”
These realities, Nguyen said, are certainly not “satisfying” to either health care providers or those waiting for their own test results, but are issues that “the entire country is grappling with right now.”
In an attempt to limit the impact of the outbreak on the University, HUHS began providing virtual visits with patients to eliminate unnecessary in-person contact. According to Nguyen, this change generally does not negatively affect the diagnostic process.
“We have been providing many remote visits already and interacting with our patients — for example, talking to them on the phone and assessing their symptoms,” Nguyen said. “Many times the physical exam is a very small part of the diagnostic process. You want to try to focus on getting the most information from a distance that we can.”
If affiliates have COVID-19 concerns, Nguyen recommended that they email HUHS to keep phone lines open for people who are “medically unstable” and who need to immediately contact HUHS to determine their next steps.
HUHS established protocols for affiliates whose symptoms are sufficiently severe to merit a physical exam. All in-person visits are now scheduled, and both staff and patients are asked to wear facemasks to ensure their safety.
“If there is someone who does need to come in to see HUHS, what would happen is that they would be given a specific time to come in, our staff would be prepared to receive them at that time, and all of the necessary protective equipment and precautions would be in place for that evaluation to happen,” Nguyen said.
However, the majority of Harvard students are now off campus and unable to physically access HUHS for an in-person visit, should they need one. Nguyen said if a physical exam is necessary for someone in that position, HUHS can communicate with that patient’s local clinicians. However, he noted that the “vast majority” of cases do not require an in-person exam.
“If they need to have a person actually physically examine them, then that would have to be based on whatever local resources are present,” Nguyen said. “If the patient knows where they plan to go for that other care, there can be communication between our office and the other clinicians so that there’s an adequate hand-off.”
Nguyen said the updated HUHS protocols and guidance were established to maintain the health and safety of staff and patients as much as possible while still providing services.
“The goal is to be able to maximize social distancing in whatever way possible while still taking care of the medical needs of our patients,” Nguyen said.

The Cambridge Public Health Department announced the city’s first death due to COVID-19 complications in a press release Sunday.
The Cambridge resident, a male in his 80s, was previously hospitalized for COVID-19.
“On behalf of the entire city, we express our deepest sympathy to the family and friends of the resident who passed away as a result of this illness,” Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob said in the press release.
The deceased patient was one of 12 retirement-age Cambridge residents who have tested positive for the virus. That said, patients between 20 and 29 years-old make up the plurality of local cases, with 16 testing positive in that age group.
The risk posed by the coronavirus outbreak remains high in the city and in the Greater Boston Area. Seventy Cambridge residents have tested positive as of March 29. Statewide, there are currently 4,955 confirmed cases and 48 deaths, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
The Cambridge Public Health Department warned that the number of confirmed Cambridge cases continues to rise due to “widespread community transmission” and “increased testing.”
COVID-19 counts in Cambridge may be higher than currently reported due to untested or asymptomatic cases, a Cambridge Public Health Department announcement read.
“All Cambridge residents should consider themselves at risk of infection” city officials wrote in the release, continuing to recommend stringent self-isolation and social distancing precautions.

Harvard College admitted more veterans and ROTC candidates to the Class of 2024 than last year, which Dean of Admissions & Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 attributes to both greater interest from applicants and the College’s own outreach efforts.
Fitzsimmons said in a Friday interview the Admissions Office has seen exponential growth in the number of admitted students identifying as veterans.
“It was one, one, two, one, and then six first-year students last year and then this year, 13,” Fitzsimmons said.
13 veterans and 47 ROTC candidates are part of the admitted Class of 2024, increasing from six veterans and 41 ROTC candidates admitted to the Class of 2023.
Fitzsimmons pointed to the College’s increased outreach efforts aimed at potential applicants currently serving in the military. Harvard has recruited applicants through work with Department of Defense-affiliated groups and, in 2017, joined Service to School’s VetLink program, an initiative linking veterans with top schools around the country.
“We've had a recruiter on the road, who has gone out to bases and gone out to community colleges and junior colleges where there'll be likely veterans, and he has made a really big difference,” Fitzsimmons said.
Many of the students who transfer into the College from other schools are veterans, with veterans making up seven of 12 transfer students admitted in total last year
“Many of these students also offer something different, because of their interest in serving their country, and, in many cases, they come from military families,” Fitzsimmons said. “They have lived all over the country and all over the world. They're a fascinating group of people, and they have a mission, you know, to serve their country upon graduation.”
Fitzsimmons said the Admissions Office appreciates the perspective and experience that veterans can bring to campus.
“One of the things we always say for every undergraduate is the best thing about going to Harvard is the education you get with all your classmates, and the experiences the veterans have had are just remarkable by any standards,” he said.

Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals and research institutions have formed six research working groups as part of a recently announced collaboration with a Chinese research institution, Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ‘82 said in an interview Friday.
In late February, the University announced it would partner with a Chinese research institute to study various aspects of novel coronavirus. Funded by Fortune Global 500 company China Evergrande Group, the partners will share $115 million over the next five years.
The partnership — which the Medical School made with the Guangzhou Institute for Respiratory Diseases in late February — was born out of an appeal for help that Hui Ka Yan, the chairman of the Evergrande Group, made to the University. According to Daley, Yan contacted Harvard after attempts between the United States and China to collaborate on solutions to the COVID-19 outbreak proved “difficult.”
“It led to this extraordinary transnational collaboration which has emerged as, I think, one of the most heartening aspects of this healthcare crisis,” he added.
Daley said he discussed the collaboration with Anthony S. Fauci, the head of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease and a member of the White House’s coronavirus task force.
“What I learned was that there was a tremendous outpouring of interest on the part of the CDC and the U.S. federal government to support efforts in China,” Daley said. “But because of the tensions between the two countries, that was proving difficult.”
“At the time, we were launching our own engagement after being sought out by colleagues in China, and he endorsed that,” he added.
Daley observed that, as coronavirus cases in the United States have surged in recent weeks, the partnership has proven to be mutually beneficial for the two nations. The United States is currently beset by more confirmed cases of the virus than any other country in the world.
“Initially, the Chinese were reaching out to us for help,” Daley said. “And now, some two months later, the tables have turned, and we're actually now seeking help from them.”
Through weekly video conferences, the two institutions’ healthcare leaders, including clinicians and scientists, gather to share knowledge about COVID-19 cases, comparing clinical hypotheses and research projects.
“The Chinese have shared with us their hard-won knowledge about the early phase of this epidemic in China,” Daley said. “They've taught us about diagnostics, they've given us enormously powerful information about the clinical management of the severest patients, so that our clinicians can be ready to give the best care because we're learning from the challenges that the Chinese physicians have faced.”
In an effort to involve scientists across the state, the Harvard researchers recently formed a Massachusetts Consortium on Pathogen Readiness. The consortium aims “to develop and invest in both the research process and supporting infrastructure to address the current global COVID-19 pandemic, and better position the Consortium for potential future outbreaks,” according to the group’s website.
Among its initial efforts, the consortium has created Evergrande COVID-19 Response Fund Awards to facilitate coronavirus-related research, accepting applications from clinicians and scientists across Massachusetts.
Harvard Medical School professor Bruce D. Walker, who co-leads the consortium, said even with a short one-week deadline, the group still received almost 450 applications for the awards. Walker said that though many of the applications are “scientifically really meritorious,” the consortium does not have enough funds to support all the projects.
He said the philanthropic funds MassCPR has received have been “transformational,” but noted that the consortium needs to identify additional sources of funds.
“They helped us to form the MassCPR and give the MassCPR legs,” Walker said. “We just want to make sure those legs are running, that there are as many of those legs as possible, and they're running as fast as they can.”
Researchers in the consortium take part in six working groups organized by different areas of need, according to Medical School professor Arlene H. Sharpe ’75, another co-leader of MassCPR. The working groups focus on clinical management, diagnostics, epidemiology, pathogenesis, therapeutics, and vaccines.
Sharpe praised the broad range of issues the groups are aiming to address.
“There's a therapeutics working group that is looking at repurposing drugs that exist, like remdesivir,” she said. “They’re also using a variety of screening approaches to identify new antivirals that might have an impact more quickly than a vaccine.”
Sharpe said the working groups draw their co-leaders from different institutions across Massachusetts, adding that the groups have also recently integrated members from the Guangzhou Institute to participate.
“Now with the integration from the [Guangzhou Institute], that'll lead to more specific collaborations,” Sharpe said. “But with the system moving forward so quickly, it's definitely a work in progress.”
For the Medical School, international collaborations extend beyond China, according to Daley. He said he has consulted with colleagues and former trainees based in countries such as Italy, Germany, and Switzerland on responses to the pandemic.
“It's just been an extraordinary learning experience,” Daley said. “We're all facing the same enemy, and it's bringing us all together as one world community.”
“It shows that science and human health transcend politics,” he added.

The Broad Institute is processing COVID-19 test samples from across New England at a rate of approximately 2,000 samples per day, the organization announced in a press release Thursday.
Broad researchers have increased their COVID-19 testing rate to approximately 12 hours per test by modifying the institute’s Clinical Research Sequencing Platform, a facility originally used for evaluating clinical samples for genomic tests. The CRSP is secure, and the federal Food and Drug Administration has validated it to function as a COVID-19 testing lab, according to the release.
“It can return data to physicians for use in diagnostics and patient care and in clinical trials,” the press release reads. “It is highly automated so that it can handle large numbers of samples. This lab is authorized to process samples collected in hospitals and other clinical settings and then deliver the results securely back to physicians.””
The news comes as Massachusetts has reported more than 4,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 27 members of the Harvard community testing positive for the virus as of last Friday.
Because state and University regulations largely bar in-person research operations, only “about 10 percent” of Broad researchers are working at the lab, with others contributing remotely.
Sheila Dodge, the general manager of Broad Genomics, said the institute conducts COVID-19 tests by analyzing RNA from nasal and oral samples.
“What we’re doing with these clinical samples is we get a nasal swab or an oral swab from the different hospital sites,” Dodge said. “We’ll actually take that and we’ll push it through what we call a reverse transcription quantitative PCR assay. So it’s not a sequencing assay, it’s actually much simpler. It’s a very simple readout that allows us to see if the virus is present or not.”
Broad scientists say they have manipulated multiple of the institute’s existing structures and facilities for high-scale COVID-19 testing. Broad Genomics Platform senior director Stacey Gabriel said the institute has always been able to quickly process numerous test samples — an ability it is now taking advantage of.
“This is what we’re built for, in this production environment here. We’re built for receiving thousands of samples a day,” Gabriel said. “That’s very purposefully how we’ve designed our systems.”
The rapid focus on COVID-19 testing is an unprecedented change for the Broad Institute, which has typically pursued more long-term projects, according to Niall Lennon, Broad’s senior director of translational genomics.
“It’s a different problem for us for sure,” Lennon said. “We are used to tackling chronic diseases over a long period of time. This has been a very different case. We’ve had to react very quickly – things are moving at breakneck speed for us – but we had to respond to the problem that’s in front of us now.”
“We can’t plan for next year yet,” he added. “We need to solve today’s problem today.”

Harvard Forward — an alumni organization advocating for the University to divest from the fossil fuel industry — will move to a “purely remote and digital campaign,” according to a Harvard Forward statement released on March 17.
The statement, which was prompted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, announced their campaign will not continue with in-person events until social distancing is no longer a necessity.
“We encourage everyone to follow the recommendations for social distancing in your own lives to the extent that you are able to do so,” the statement reads.
Despite Harvard Forward putting forward its own slate of candidates in October, the Harvard Alumni Association Committee did not ultimately nominate any of the group’s Overseer candidates. Candidates, however, could appear on the ballot if they submitted a petition with 2,936 alumni signatures — one percent of eligible voters in the prior year’s election — by Feb 1. All of Harvard Forward’s candidates met the signature requirement, receiving over 4,500 alumni signatures each.
During the nomination period, the Harvard Forward campaign and its supporters held office hours in more than 50 cities around the world to allow alumni to fill out nomination forms in person. Harvard Forward also gained ground by encouraging people to submit nominations online through the University’s election website, and by visiting continuing care facilities to solicit the help of older Harvard alumni.
In its statement regarding COVID-19, Harvard Forward stressed the importance of “community” during the pandemic.
“In these strange and difficult times, the support we find in our communities is essential, and we’re deeply grateful for the community we’ve built around Harvard Forward,” it reads. “We’ve heard from supporters that participating in this effort gives them something meaningful to work on, encouraging them to be hopeful in this period of anxiety and social isolation—and that is certainly true for us as well.”
The press release encouraged supporters to join the campaign in digital outreach as a way to pass time while in social isolation.
It also linked to a GoFundMe page created by Harvard First Generation Alumni to assist first generation and low-income Harvard students in the wake of the University’s announcement to send students home. As of March 29, the GoFundMe page had surpassed its goal of $50,000 and raised more than $65,000.
“Additionally, as most of you likely know, Harvard required students to leave campus on short notice, placing an enormous burden on those who are low-income and/or first-generation students,” the statement reads. “There has been great organizing work occurring to support students who need help, and we encourage those of you who can to contribute to these efforts.”
This year’s election for the Board is scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19. Alumni can vote by traditional paper ballot or online. Exceptions apply to members of the Harvard Corporation and those in University instruction and governance positions, who cannot vote.

We’ve navigated many a Canvas course page in our day. And, let us tell you, some of them do not hit like others. If you’re a professor who wants a course page that slaps, especially now that everything has gone virtual, here’s what you need:
On the Front Page 
• Emails and office hours of the course head and all TFs/CAs easily visible.
• Class meeting time(s) and location. (If the location changes post-shopping week please for the love of god update this. If we are confused about where we need to be at 9 a.m., we’re not showing up. You’re lucky we woke up to attempt to go in the first place.)
• Brief description/overview of the class.
• Maybe a fun picture?
• Honestly, give us the super important due dates so every time we open Canvas we see them.
• An embedded PDF of the course syllabus so we can scroll through it and don’t have to keep downloading it.
Separate Tabs
1. Syllabus
• Have a separate syllabus tab typed out (not in PDF form) with hyperlinks so we can easily access everything.
• On this note, please make it clear what your system is for assigning readings.
2. Discussions
• No one wants to have to go to a whole new website (*cough* Piazza) to access discussion questions we don’t want to come up with/answer weekly. Just make a Canvas discussion tab, please. And label each week with the date/theme, and the hour it’s due!
3. Files
• Make folders within this tab for the readings each week (i.e. “Readings for Week of Month/Day).
• If the readings aren’t online, we’re not reading them. Sorry not sorry. Link us to Hollis if you must, but going through the effort of copying and pasting the reading title into Hollis, Google, or Scribd? Forget about it.
• We know you know how to find readings for free online. And if a student tells you they’ve found a reading online, upload that to your files, and email the class about it, so people don’t have to buy readings/look for them on their own. Put in that effort and we will love you forever, or until you give us an EUM grade.
4. Assignments
• This is fairly self-explanatory. Give us the due date and the instructions/rubric/link to download the pset all in one place, please.
5. Resources
• This includes support for mental/physical health issues that students might experience during the semester, links to research journals they might not know about, and academic support.
We know you’re required to put up the Academic Integrity policy and some other fun things, but if you complete this checklist, you’re on your way to having an emptier inbox without emails of “Where is this reading?” and excuses of “Sorry I missed the discussion questions, I thought you meant pizza, not Piazza.”
