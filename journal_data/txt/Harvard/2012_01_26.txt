After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Next weekend, the University of Pennsylvania will host the second national BDS conference, an event that will advocate for the “growing global campaign to boycott, divest from and sanction (BDS) the State of Israel.” Last April, Omar Barghouti, a leader and spokesperson of this campaign, spoke at Harvard. He insisted that anyone wanting to learn more about the fundamental tenets of BDS should read his recently released book, aptly titled “Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions.”
So I followed his advice—I bought a copy of Barghouti’s book and read it from cover to cover. He writes some things in this work about the aims of BDS that lead me to believe that the movement is being far from forthright about its ultimate goals.
The Penn conference states that the purpose of the global BDS campaign is to isolate Israel economically “until it complies with its obligations under international and human rights law.” Understanding this to mean ending the Israeli occupation and fostering a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, a number of Zionists—that is, individuals who believe in the Jewish state’s right to exist—have either joined the BDS Call or implicitly sanctioned it. Two years ago in the Los Angeles Times, for example, an Israeli professor insisted that he supports BDS because it is “the only way to save his country.” Jewish Voice for Peace, an organization composed of both “Zionists [and] anti-Zionists,” considers itself “proud to be a part of the BDS movement.” Last year, J Street, an American liberal Zionist organization, held a panel at their national conference on the efficacy of this movement’s tactics “as a means to end the occupation.” Although J Street does not endorse the BDS movement, J Street’s president describes it in his book as a group of “activists who seek to raise pressure…against Israel to end the occupation.”
Clearly, these individuals have not read Barghouti’s work.
“A few Israeli and international activists have a tendency to make the [BDS] struggle Israel-centric, arguing that ending the occupation is good for Israel, above everything else,” Barghouti writes. “We totally reject that ‘save Israeli apartheid’ view.” He goes on to say that although BDS should coalesce with diverse political forces, “caution should be exercised in alliances with ‘soft’ Zionists, lest they assume the leadership of the BDS movement in the West, lowering the ceiling of its demands beyond recognition.”
So what, then, are BDS’s demands? Although Barghouti insists that BDS is neutral on the debate about a one-state versus two-state solution, even a cursory glance at Barghouti’s book reveals that this movement considers the existence of a Jewish state in the region patently unacceptable. For example, Barghouti explains that his movement cannot ally with Israeli peace groups, because even “the most radical Israeli ‘Zionist-left’ figures and groups are still Zionist, adhering to the racist principles of Zionism” that “maintain Israel’s character as a colonial, ethnocentric, apartheid state,” which BDS seeks to dismantle.
If the BDS movement were more open about its aims to purge the Jewish state from the Middle East—rather than just end some of its policies—I could have written an op-ed decrying the movement for its distortion of international law rather than its duplicity. I could have asked, for example, how the movement could possibly believe that a liberal democracy cannot have an ethnic identity when democracies across Eastern Europe—including members of the European Union like Finland, Slovenia and Germany—explicitly privilege one ethnicity over others in areas like immigration and culture. I could have also noted how odd it is that the movement vocally opposes the ethnic nature of the Jewish state, yet says nothing about the myriad Arab states that surround it.
But the BDS movement hides its ultimate goal of dismantling the Jewish state behind its public rhetoric. As a result, it has co-opted numerous individuals—and quite possibly donors—who desire to see both a Jewish and Palestinian state flourish into supporting its campaign. Although some members of the movement might actually support the Jewish state’s continued existence, as Barghouti makes abundantly clear, the Palestinian BDS National Committee—the “reference and guiding force for the global BDS movement”—cannot do so under any circumstances.
So because this movement will not broadcast its ultimate aims loud enough, I will do it for them. If you support the BDS movement, you are supporting an organization that is actively working to undermine the Jewish state. Utilizing the vocabulary of international norms, the movement actually systematically attempts to undermine the international consensus that recognizes Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And if you support this right—regardless of your politics, regardless of your stance on the occupation, and regardless of your feelings towards the current Israeli right-wing government—then there is only one moral option. Boycott the BDS movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, activists gathered in Harvard Square and near Harvard Medical School’s New England Primate  Research Center to protest animal cruelty in HMS’s labs.  NEPRC has been cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for violations of the Animal Welfare Act, an offense for which, protesters believe, Harvard should have its license to experiment on animals suspended. We are enormously disturbed by the incidences of animal cruelty uncovered in Harvard labs, and believe that HMS should be held accountable for its alleged negligent handling of lab animals. As members of the Harvard community, we all have the opportunity to urge Harvard faculty and administrators to regard charges of animal cruelty with the utmost seriousness and to recognize our institution as a leading university that should set an example for many other institutions.
Among the nine animals that were subjected to mistreatment were, according to the USDA, rabbits, a dog, a sheep, and a goat. But what is particularly difficult to confront is that three primates were also among the animals that died under poor conditions in HMS labs. Primates have cognitive faculties so similar to those of humans that primate experimentation has been outlawed in several nations. Spain, Austria, Germany, Belgium, New Zealand, Sweden, and the Netherlands have all banned experimentation on apes, and primate experimentation has not been approved in the United Kingdom in over a decade. In light of the extremely contentious global status of primate testing, these deaths are particularly uncomfortable.
While there is no doubt that HMS should be held accountable to the USDA, Harvard should also employ its own policies to prevent animal cruelty in the future. For example, administrators should consider commissioning an internal investigation or implementing a regular internal auditing process. A citation from the USDA results only in a letter of warning or in a fine of up to $10,000, neither of which are severe enough consequences to encourage our enormously wealthy university to clean up its act seriously.
In addition to actively working to prevent cruelty in its animal experiments, Harvard can also seek to prevent animal cruelty by becoming a leader in developing alternatives to animal experimentation. The Johns Hopkins  University, for example, opened its Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing in 1981 and has since led the way in developing humane alternatives to animal experimentation, enabling many organizations to reduce and even eliminate their reliance on animal testing. Non-animal methods, such as in vitro testing, can be even more accurate than animal tests because they do not rely on data from animals that are not genetically identical to humans. By prioritizing the development of non-animal experimentation methods, as has JHU, HMS can become a world leader in biomedical ethics.
As a university with unparalleled resources, Harvard stands uniquely positioned to reduce cruelty in scientific experimentation. Some oppose animal experimentation on principle and some do not, but we can all agree that humane alternatives to animal testing, when available, are far preferable. Sentient beings should always be worthy of our consideration. As animal testing will no doubt continue for the foreseeable future at Harvard-affiliated institutions, we should make sure that government regulations are adhered to and animals subjected to the minimal amount of pain or mistreatment possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s been a fair amount of discussion on campus over the past few months about income inequality in the U.S., Harvard’s role in such inequality, and the socioeconomic diversity of Harvard students themselves. With so little publicized information available on the socioeconomic diversity of Harvard undergraduates, I hope to provide reliable facts and analysis to help thin the fog of misinformation.
The data behind the following breakdown comes straight from our own Financial Aid Office, particularly their fact sheet (based on the 2010-2011 academic year). I also used statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau on the distributions of U.S. incomes.
According to the census, about 96 percent of American households make less than $200,000 a year. Last year, approximately 3,610 students applied for financial aid from this income bracket, out of a total of 6,636 currently enrolled undergraduates. It seems fair to assume that almost all students whose families make below $200,000 applied for financial aid, considering that the process is quite easy to complete and families stand so much to gain. Harvard policy states that families with annual incomes below $60,000 pay only a student contribution of a few thousand dollars, and families with annual incomes between $60,000 and $180,000 pay the student contribution plus a family contribution averaging 10 percent of annual income. Even at the top of the latter bracket families would pay approximately $20,000 compared to the sticker price of $52,652, saving over $30,000 for a few hours of work. Harvard also makes specific note that financial aid is still available above $200,000, and at least 10 percent of students receiving non-repayable aid fall into this income range.
If we do assume that almost all students from families making less than $200,000 annually applied for financial aid, we come to the stunning conclusion that approximately 45.6 percent of Harvard undergraduates come from families with incomes above $200,000, placing them in the top 3.8 percent of American households. Even more shockingly, only about 4 percent of Harvard undergraduates come from the bottom quintile of U.S. incomes and a mere 17.8 percent come from the bottom three quintiles of U.S. incomes.
The financial aid numbers also refute the misconception that Harvard is more accessible for poor families than wealthy ones. We can examine the true burden of paying Harvard tuition by comparing income-after-Harvard, or a family’s remaining yearly income after paying Harvard, with their income-before-Harvard. The only possible range where families’ income-after-Harvard could be lower than those with smaller incomes-before-Harvard is $60,000-$66,667. For this condition to be met, Harvard would have to require a full 10 percent family contribution, bringing income-after-Harvard to slightly below $60,000. Only families earning between $54,000-$60,000, in which range the family contribution does not exist, could have higher incomes-after-Harvard than families with greater incomes-before-Harvard. However, outside of these unlikely marginal conditions, families making more than $66,667 a year  will always have greater incomes-after-Harvard than that of families with smaller incomes-before-Harvard. While some complain that wealthier families bear a disproportionately higher burden, I find it difficult to sympathize with the complaint that a $20,000 annual payment for a Harvard education is an unbearable burden on a family with a $180,000 annual income.
Unfortunately, Harvard structurally encourages obliviousness to our own skewed income distribution by misnaming our financial aid initiatives. Our “low income initiative” covers families with incomes up to the 58.3rd percentile of annual incomes, and our “middle income initiative” covers those with incomes from the 58.3rd percentile to the approximately 94th percentile. How incomes above the 50th percentile count as “low” and ones above the 90th percentile count as “middle” is beyond me. The self-held myth that Harvard undergraduates come from the “middle class” is a dangerous delusion indeed, and Harvard’s at-best negligence or at-worst complicity in perpetuating this belief is concerning. At a school whose motto is truth, we’re far from forthcoming about how wealthy our students actually are.
While the photos on our admissions materials may indicate other priorities, the educational value of diversity stems from variety of thought and experience. It can hardly be said that Harvard is socioeconomically homogeneous but it would still be a stretch to call it socioeconomically diverse. Harvard may be missing some of the most important factors that give value to diversity. Undoubtedly, Harvard is more socioeconomically diverse than ever before but, as with all things, better does not always equal good. In a (hopefully) meritocratic admissions system, our current socioeconomic distribution raises difficult questions about the role of financial capital—and its social and cultural capital correlates—in acquiring and displaying merit.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new calendar year heralds a new year of political campaigning, and it should be no surprise that in this especially contentious race, mud will fly. It is inevitable that at least some of the attack angles will be especially bitter and even insulting. However, there is one line of attack against Senator Rick J. Santorum that has already gone well beyond any sense of human decency.
In 1996, Santorum’s wife, Karen, gave birth to a stillborn infant named Gabriel. Joe Klein, generally no friend of Senator Santorum, describes this event in a January 5 blog post for TIME based on his interviews with the family. Klein notes that Gabriel underwent surgery in the womb to remedy a kidney defect, but that this caused an infection in Karen Santorum. She ultimately miscarried, and the Santorums elected to bring the body of Gabriel home for the night to “see that it was ‘a perfect, tiny little baby.’”
This episode in Santorum’s life is public knowledge, but it would seem clear that it had no relevance in a political debate. Unfortunately, some commentators have not comprehended that. Alan S. Colmes, long-time contributor to FOX News, claimed in a January 2 show that Republican viewers should think twice about Santorum after hearing about the “crazy things he’s said and done,” which he defined as “taking his two-hour old baby who died right after childbirth home and played [sic] with it.” On its own, Colmes’s attack, while outlandish, might be dismissed as merely one pundit’s angry ranting.
However Eugene H. Robinson, Washington Post columnist and MSNBC contributor, has also claimed that Sen. Santorum’s actions were “crazy” or “weird.” On the “Rachel Maddow Show,” Robinson stated that “he’s not a little weird, he’s really weird,” giving “the story of how he and his wife handled the stillborn child…It’s a very weird story.” Maddow, unlike the commentators speaking with Colmes on FOX, did not push back but moved on to the next segment.
When Robinson was directly confronted about his attack the next day, he admitted, “I wish I hadn’t said it that way.” However, he never backtracked on his claims about how “really weird” Santorum was. Colmes at least submitted a sincere apology to the Santorum family, but Robinson obstinately refused to apologize and merely stated that he “didn’t mean to offend anyone.”
What could possibly drive these pundits to attack a candidate on his deceased child? Commentary’s Peter Wehner blames the growing acceptance of abortion among the liberal political class, noting that “in some quarters those who routinely champion abortion, even partial-birth abortion, are viewed as enlightened and morally sophisticated while those grieving the loss of their son, whom they took home for a night before burying, are mercilessly mocked.” Certainly it is unlikely that Colmes and Robinson view abortion as a flippant process. Yet, when many pundits support the argument that abortion is purely a choice with no regard to the life of the fetus, it cannot be surprising when the most extreme views would engage in cavalier mocking of the death of a stillborn infant.
It should be noted that the actions of the Santorums were in no way “weird” or “crazy.” The American Pregnancy Association’s website lists ways for families to cope with miscarriages, including taking pictures, naming the child, and spending time with the infant. The tragedy of a stillborn infant is clearly one of the most heart-wrenching tragedies that a family can endure, and no one has the right to make judgments about a family’s grieving process. Families and even infants have certainly come under unjustified attack from all sides in debates. The cases of the push polling on John McCain’s “illegitimate black child,” referencing his adopted Bangladeshi daughter, and the charges that Sarah Palin’s disabled infant son, Trig, was actually her grandson from Bristol Palin, remain infamous.
This is hardly the first time that Santorum has endured harsh criticism from pundits. His views on abortion, homosexuality, and the role of government in enforcing morality have attracted much vitriol from liberal commentators. Most infamously, the blogger Dan K. Savage sparked an entire phenomenon of manipulating Google search results to display his extremely vulgar neologism, “santorum.” Yet, while these attacks are juvenile and offensive, they at least are made in direct protest to Santorum’s views on homosexuality.
These more recent cases, however, do not even relate to Santorum’s political opinions. Colmes and Robinson have elected to engage in ad hominem attacks against Santorum and his family for decisions made during a deeply tragic event. Especially when public discourse seems to demand a new sense of civility after years of hostile rhetoric, such attacks cannot continue into this election cycle. They are not only completely irrelevant to political discourse, but they are also beyond the pale of human decency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address Tuesday night discussed issues of concern at Harvard, including the rising cost of college tuition nationwide and challenges faced by undocumented students.
Harvard offers its students robust financial aid, and University President Drew G. Faust has been vocal in her support for the DREAM Act, which would help undocumented students gain citizenship upon successful completion of part of their higher education.
Last night, Obama earmarked those issues—especially tuition—as problems faced by the nation’s youth.
“When kids do graduate, the most daunting challenge can be the cost of college,” Obama said in his address before Congress.
While Obama proposed measures to aid students facing rising tuition costs, Harvard Kennedy School professor Joshua S. Goodman, an education policy expert, said Harvard students would likely remain largely unaffected given the College’s generous existing financial aid program.
“Harvard is a funny example of a university that charges wealthy applicants in full and then turns around and uses that money to fund lower income applicants,” Goodman said.
Harvard’s financial aid program is often praised as one of the best in the country, covering the full cost of tuition for students whose families earn less than $65,000 a year. About 60 percent of Harvard students receive need-based financial aid.
But with students pursuing college educations at institutions nationwide in mind, Harvard professors expressed support for Obama’s push to expand federal support.
“I think the question of education is important to the future of the country as well as to addressing widespread inequality,” said Graduate School of Education professor Mark R. Warren. “It’s vital to any hope of rebuilding the middle class.”
Obama also spoke in support of enabling undocumented students to pursue college degrees—a reference to the DREAM Act in content but not in name.
“Let’s also remember that hundreds of thousands of talented, hardworking students in this country face another challenge: the fact that they aren’t yet American citizens,” Obama said. “Many were brought here as small children, are American through and through, yet they live every day with the threat of deportation.”
In 2009, Faust publicly affirmed Harvard’s support of the DREAM Act, which, if passed, would grant conditional permanent residency to undocumented students who came to the United States before the age of 16, under the condition that they graduate from high school and complete either two years of higher education or two years of military service.
According to Kevin Casey, a Harvard lobbyist in Washington, the University continues to support the bill and is working with members of Congress to pass the legislation.
Government and sociology professor Theda R. Skocpol, who praised Obama for the “strength and determination” he displayed during the speech, said the issue of immigration allowed the president to draw a contrast between his party and the Republicans during an election year.
“The Tea Party has pressured the Republican Party to take a brutally hard line on immigration policies,” Skocpol said. “That’s a place where Democrats and Republicans differ, and people should know that when they go to the voting booth.”

The first phase of a multimillion dollar project meant to increase wheelchair accessibility to the Harvard MBTA station came to a close on Thursday with the opening of a new elevator in Brattle Square, leaving behind a legacy of frustration during the 17-month-long project.
Several local businesses suffered from a loss of foot traffic during a normally busy summer season due to the construction zone at their doorsteps.
The renovation, which made the entrance to the MBTA station at JFK Street and Brattle Street accessible to wheelchairs and strollers, cost $4.1 million.
In the next phase of the ongoing project, the MBTA plans to replace the existing elevator at the main entrance to the Harvard station, near Out of Town News, with a larger glass-enclosed round lift, according to Desiree Patrice, the project manager.
The construction project was launched as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit by the Boston Center for Independent Living and eleven individuals against the MBTA. The transportation authority agreed to construct additional elevators and escalators for several highly trafficked stations, according to Patrice. In total, the renovations are expected to cost $122 million.
In Brattle Square, workers removed the existing staircase and rebuilt it in a new location before adding the elevator. During that part of the project, from July to Dec. 2010, a fence blocked the area, obscuring the entrances of local businesses from passersby.
Stephen Zedros, manager of Brattle Square Florist, estimated that his sales dropped 20 percent during the summer of 2010 due to the construction.
Ordinarily, the Brattle Square plaza is a popular summer hangout. “It’s a big draw to have people sit out there during the nice weather,” said James Gilligan, manager of Hidden Sweets.
Several business owners said they wondered whether the construction was carried out as efficiently as possible.
To Edward P. VerPlanck, owner of Dickson Bros., the project seemed inordinately long.
“No wonder the T is in debt. They’d have an MBTA policeman standing there doing nothing,” VerPlanck said.
VerPlanck added that his hardware store, which is located across from the plaza and was not blocked by the fence, saw increased sales during the project because of some business with the construction workers.
The MBTA took steps to minimize the disruption to local commerce, posting a sign on the fence with the names of the businesses that were hidden behind it and conducting much of the work at night in order to minimize disruption, according to Patrice.
“The organization of the project was really impressive. The work was done relatively quickly, and there wasn’t much noise or construction dust that made it difficult for us to do business with our doors open,” Marley J. Brush, co-owner of Crema Café, wrote in an email.
Nan Stock, a Medford resident, used the elevator soon after it opened on Thursday.
“I’ve already seen it get used a lot. That elevator is so much more appealing than the one in the center. It’s big enough to accommodate more strollers and wheelchairs too,” she said.
In addition to building the glass elevator, the project included $1 million of work in the plaza, adding granite seating, planters, and new pavement.

For six months, the students of the Harvard Ceramics Program constructed a nine-piece mural to decorate the bare walls of a local hospital. On Wednesday night, the artists and their friends gathered to admire the recently-installed work.
“This whole hallway was empty and crying out for some art,” said Allison Newsome, a teacher in the ceramics program at Harvard’s Office for the Arts.
The new mural, comprised of ceramic slabs of different shapes and designs, will now be a permanent fixture of the hallway outside the Women’s Health Center at the Cambridge Health Alliance’s hospital in Cambridge, which is a Harvard Medical School teaching affiliate. The CHA provides health care for the residents of the northern greater Boston area.
The murals were created and donated by students in Newsome’s course last spring. Newsome, who has donated her own work to local hospitals in the past, created the course hoping that her students’ contribution would bring cheer to patients.
Each artist in the class chose a life-affirming message for his or her design. Designs included hot air balloons, trees, doves, and fish.
At the Wednesday night showing, admirers strolled up and down the hallway, pausing to more closely examine a particular piece. Many ran their hands along the grooves of the earth-toned ceramics.
“It’s a great addition to the ambiance,” said Allison Bayer, acting chief executive officer of the CHA. “There’s a very organic feeling, a very peaceful feeling.”
Students used high-quality indigenous clay donated by the Stiles and Hart Brick Company, a local historic brick manufacturer, to create a heart in the center of each piece.
“Each one means something different,” said Pam Ward, a student in Newsome’s class.
Stephanie Osser, another student, crafted a piece that features three children, two playing musical instruments and the other using a rolling pin.
The words to the classic Louis Armstrong song “What a Wonderful World” grace the bottom of the mural.
Ward recalled the collaborative effort required to make the mural. Each component weighed 150 pounds, requiring multiple people to move and lift each piece.
“There was a great sense of community,” Ward said. “We couldn’t have done this individually.”

Researchers from Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital found that exposure to high levels of iodide—commonly given intravenously to patients for medical imaging procedures—is associated with an increased risk of thyroid disease.
The study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, is the first large-scale investigation of how iodide contrast agents used in medical imaging procedures can disrupt thyroid function. The study was based on data gathered over a 20-year period from patients treated at either Brigham and Women’s or Massachusetts General Hospital without pre-existing hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.
Approximately 80 million doses of iodinated contrast agents are administered each year to aid doctors in seeing blood vessels and tissues, largely during CT scans and cardiac catheterizations, according to Connie M. Rhee, lead author of the study.
According to Rhee, a single dose of contrast agent could contain 90 to several hundred times the recommended daily intake of iodide.
“Iodine is present in things even beyond contrasts. It is in a lot of medications, in the foods we eat, and it is even in some cleaning agents that we use in the hospital in small amounts,” Rhee said.
In an emailed statement, Elizabeth N. Pearce ’90, a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine, said that “the ‘as low as reasonable achievable’ principle should always be exercised in determining the need for radiation exposure, as potential risks of iodinated contrast studies extend beyond the thyroidal risk from iodine exposure.”
Hypothyroid and hyperthyroid disease are associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and high blood pressure and with damage to other organs beyond the heart.
According to Pearce, physicians should take particular care in administering iodinated contrast imaging procedures with patients at high risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. However, Rhee cautioned that patients should not necessarily avoid medical imaging procedures to prevent thyroid problems, since medical imaging with iodinated contrast dyes is often vital for urgent diagnoses.
Both Rhee and Pearce noted that further research is still necessary.
“Future prospective studies are needed to better understand risk factors for the development of iodine-induced thyroid dysfunction following exposure to iodinated contrast,” Pearce said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since Harvard University Library announced last week that its upcoming reorganization would include downsizing staff, workers have circulated several petitions against the layoffs and picketed on Wednesday outside of a regularly scheduled meeting for library staff members.
Roughly 20 people participated in Wednesday’s protest, which took place during a meeting that was meant to allow library workers to express their concerns, according to a University spokesperson.
“Today’s conversation provided an opportunity to address some misconceptions, and it was made clear that staff members are not being asked to reapply for their jobs,” the spokesperson said in an email, referring to a rumor that circulated among workers last week. “The remainder of the meeting focused on how Library staff can prepare to play a role in the new organization.”
Last Thursday, officials told library staff at three town hall meetings that the library’s planned restructuring may include voluntary and involuntary reductions in staff size. The library board met on Tuesday to consider a formal plan for the reorganization, but, despite requests, the University has not released details on whether any plan was approved. If the library board passed a proposal, it would be reviewed by University President Drew G. Faust in February.
Geoffrey “Geoff” Carens, a library employee and member of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said that the timetable for the impending decisions demands a stronger response in addition to the union’s negotiations.
“We may not have a ton of time,” Carens said. “The cuts are supposed to come in July. We want to strike while the iron is hot.”
Aryt Alasti, a security guard who is a member of Service Employees International Union, said the library workers’ union was not doing enough to fight potential layoffs.
While SEIU represents security guards and custodians, HUCTW represents clerical and technical workers, including library staff.
“Unfortunately, the HUCTW leadership does not support such actions as this [protest], historically and philosophically,” Alasti said. “They prefer to, from my standpoint, negotiate until failure, and that’s the end of that.”
Desiree Goodwin, a library assistant at the Frances Loeb Library in Harvard’s Graduate School of Design, has spearheaded the circulation of two petitions: one that urges general support for academic librarians and a second that demands an immediate firm stance by Bill Jaeger, the director of HUCTW, against layoffs. More than 120 people had signed the two petitions as of Wednesday evening.
Occupy Harvard members are currently drafting a third petition, targeting the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body.
Goodwin, who has been employed by the University for 16 years, said the news of potential downsizing was “dropped on us like a bombshell.”
Goodwin said that despite regular meetings before the transition plan was announced, neither union leadership nor library supervisors had advance warning of the potential downsizing.
“We were all invited to these discussions as if we were part of the process,” she said. “It’s not that we object to modernization, streamlining procedure. It’s the structure being imposed on us—and the pace.”
The University spokesperson said that Harvard will work with HUCTW, in compliance with the union’s contract. She declined to specify when such a meeting would take place.
In Goodwin’s view, the purpose of the layoffs is “maximizing Harvard’s profit margin.”
“This is not about creating the best library system in the country,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Alexander J. Spencer ’15 was attacked by a dog as he walked onto JFK Street at 3 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon.
Spencer said he was on his way to crew practice at Weld Boat House when the dog, which he identified as a pit bull, lunged at him and bit his arm.
The attack was unprovoked, according to Spencer. “I’m trying to think of a reason, because [the attack] doesn’t really make any sense,” he said.
Spencer immediately pushed the dog away as its owner pulled the animal off of him.
He received six puncture wounds from the dog’s initial bite in addition to several scrapes.
“I was in shock and there was blood all over me and all over my arm,” Spencer said.
After the attack, Spencer asked the dog owner to wait while he called the police. But Spencer said that the man, who had been soliciting money on the sidewalk with his dog, quickly packed up his belongings and left the scene.
As he called the police, Spencer walked to the nearby Harvard University Health Services, where his puncture wounds were treated.
Though UHS staff told Spencer that rabies is uncommon in Massachusetts, he received rabies shots as a precautionary measure.
Spencer received nine shots, including one directly into each puncture wound. He must return to UHS several times in the next two weeks to receive further vaccinations.
According to Spencer, the Cambridge Police Department came to the scene of the attack, but the man had left by the time they arrived.
Spencer, who is a Crimson arts writer, said that the police assured him that they will continue to look for the man and his dog.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Jan. 27 at 3:14 a.m.
For the first time in five years, Harvard College has seen a dip in applications. This year, 34,285 students applied for spots in the Harvard College Class of 2016, down 665 applicants from last year.
The 1.9 percent decline in applications comes after the College received an all-time high of 34,950 applications for this year’s freshman class.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said he attributes the decline in applications to Princeton's and the University of Virginia’s reinstatements of their early action programs, a move which Harvard also made this year. The three colleges’ decisions to offer early action programs after a four-year hiatus may have led students to apply to fewer colleges, he added.
Fitzsimmons also noted that the number of high school seniors from the Northeast, home to many of Harvard’s applicants each year, has decreased.
While Fitzsimmons said the make-up of this year’s applicant pool resembled last year’s, he noted that international applications to the College increased by only 5 percent this year, as opposed to last year’s 20 percent jump.
Fitzsimmons added that the Admissions Office will be careful not to accept more students than there are beds for at the College. “We will admit a number in April that will ensure that overcrowding does not occur,” he said.
Due to this more conservative approach, Fitzsimmons predicted that more students will be taken off the waitlist than in recent years.
Fitzsimmons said that he does not believe that this year’s decline is indicative of subsequent applicant pools.
Other Ivy League institutions also witnessed a decline in their application numbers this year.
Applications to Columbia University decreased by 8.9 percent, according to The Columbia Spectator, and applications to the University of Pennsylvania decreased by 1.7 percent this admissions cycle, according to The Daily Pennsylvanian.
However, Yale saw applications rise by 5.8 percent and Stanford by 7 percent.
Admissions officers are currently reviewing applications for the regular decision cycle as well as those of students who were deferred during the early action process.Harvard has already admitted 772 students to the Class of 2016 through its reinstated early action program.
Regular decision applicants will be notified of their admissions decisions by email on March 29. All admitted students, whether they are admitted in December or March, must accept or decline Harvard’s offer by May 1.

CORRECTION: Jan. 27, 2012
An earlier version of this article misstated the increase in applications to Yale College this year. It was 5.8 percent, not 8.5 percent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Crimson would rather forget its last two trips to New Haven’s John J. Lee Amphitheater. Two last-second shots, one made, one missed, both resulted in losses for the Harvard men’s basketball team.
On Feb. 28, 2011, Harvard visited Yale’s home court and was upset by the Bulldogs, losing, 70-69, after then-sophomore Brandyn Curry’s last-second layup attempt rolled off the rim.
Two weeks later, the Crimson returned to John J. Lee Amphitheater, this time to take on Princeton in last season’s Ivy League playoff, and fell in the final seconds once again after Doug Davis nailed a buzzer beater to give the Tigers a one-point win.
On Friday night, the Crimson makes its first trip to Yale’s home court since the Tigers prolonged Harvard’s NCAA tournament drought in heartbreaking fashion.
"We’ve got to exorcise some demons with that arena," said co-captain Oliver McNally, whose Crimson (16-2, 2-0 Ivy) will visit the Bulldogs on Friday night before traveling to Brown on Saturday.
The visit to Yale (12-4, 2-0) is expected to be Harvard’s toughest challenge in conference play. The Bulldogs, currently riding a four-game winning streak, were picked to finish second in the preseason Ivy League media poll and are projected to be the Crimson’s biggest challenger for the conference title.
"I think Yale is an outstanding team," Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. "They’re a little bit under the radar. I think they are a very, very good basketball team."
The Bulldogs, who have picked up wins over Vermont and Central Connecticut and narrowly lost to Wake Forest, are led by senior Greg Mangano.
A 6’11" center with the ability to knock down three-pointers and shut down opposing bigs, Mangano has followed up on a standout junior season by averaging 19.4 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks per game midway through his senior year.
"Mangano is an outstanding player," Amaker said. "He’s a tough cover because of his size…. He can really shoot it from the outside."
But Mangano’s biggest impact might be on the defensive end. In the Crimson’s two matchups with the Bulldogs last season, Mangano limited Harvard co-captain Keith Wright to 14.5 points per game on 44.0 percent shooting (11 of 25)—14.4 percentage points below his season average of 58.4.
"He’s obviously a force to deal with, and we’ll have to help and do a lot of things, but I’m not sure that we’re going to be able to stop him," Amaker said. "He scores and affects the game in a lot of different ways."
But Mangano isn’t the only player the Crimson has to worry about. In the post, Mangano is joined by sophomore Jeremiah Kreisberg, a 6’9" big averaging 8.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. In his two matchups with the Crimson last season, Kreisberg averaged 12.5 points and posted a double-double during Harvard’s 78-75 win at Lavietes Pavilion.
On the wing, Yale features a talented pair in junior Austin Morgan—a 5’11" guard averaging 13.1 points per game and shooting 44.2 percent from beyond the arc—and senior Reggie Willhite, who leads the Bulldogs in assists and steals and is third on the team in rebounding.
"I think Willhite is a very underrated player in our league," Amaker said. "He does a lot for their team. [He is] a very athletic, physical wing player. It’s going to be tough for us to keep him off the backboard."
While the Crimson’s Friday matchup with the Bulldogs is expected to be tightly contested, Saturday’s contest against Brown (6-13, 0-2) is projected to go Harvard’s way.
Even so, the Crimson knows from past experience that the Bears are not to be overlooked.
When Harvard met Brown for the first time last season, the Crimson trailed a Bears team that finished seventh in the Ivy League by 22 at the half before staging a ferocious comeback to win, 85-78.
Two weeks later, Harvard pulled off another comeback against Brown, fighting back from a nine-point halftime deficit to capture a 74-68 win.
This year’s Bears squad boasts a talented offense spearheaded by 6’1" guard Sean McGonagill, the Ivy League’s reigning Rookie of the Year. Now a sophomore, McGonagill has continued to find the bottom of the net, averaging a team-high 14.8 points and 5.5 assists per game.
But while the Crimson has a perimeter defender in Curry capable of slowing the Bears’ leading scorer, Brown lacks an answer for Wright in the post. Last season, Wright overpowered the Bears frontcourt, posting double-doubles in both Harvard wins.
That being said, the Crimson isn’t expecting Brown to fold as soon as Harvard shows up.
"People are going to really gun for us," McNally said. "We know, especially when we’re on the road, we’re going to get [the] other team’s absolute best shot."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard men’s hockey team is once again not living up to expectations. Eight of its 28 players have been drafted by NHL franchises, so it is clearly not due to a lack of talent. Yet the team still toils in the bottom half of the ECAC standings. Barring a significant turnaround, the Crimson (4-6-8, 3-4-6 ECAC) will yet again finish with a losing record, extending a winning drought that has lasted since a 17-13-4 campaign in 2007-08.
This is the eighth season for Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91, who played on the 1989 national championship team and had a coaching record of 73-52-11 (0.536) through his first four seasons at the helm of his alma mater. But since then, Donato’s teams have gone just 34-64-18 (0.293), seemingly crumbling under expectations.
It is widely understood that the most important person on the ice at any one time is the goalkeeper. Not only does the keeper generally stay on the ice for all three periods, but also one need only look at last year’s NHL Stanley Cup between the Boston Bruins and Vancouver Canucks to see the effect of a goalie on a game: The Bruins’ Tim Thomas caught fire, led his team to a championship, and was named MVP of the playoffs. His counterpart, the Canucks’ Roberto Luongo, gave up 23 goals in seven games and was lambasted by the media.
Donato’s first few seasons as coach were presided over in goal first by All-American Dov Grumet-Morris ’05, who holds nine program records including save percentage, and then by John Daigneau ’06, third all-time in save percentage. Kyle Richter ’11 graduated last year after a long career in goal but was only once in his four seasons as a starter able to play in more than 75 percent of the team’s minutes. That was the aforementioned 2007-08 campaign.
If the Crimson is going to find sustained success, it will need to find stability at goalie. Enter freshman Steve Michalek.
Richter and classmate Ryan Carroll ’11 roughly split the minutes between the pipes last season, with Carroll ending the campaign in the starting role. With the pair’s graduation, Harvard entered the season with no clear-cut heir apparent in goal.
Sophomore Raphael Girard had seen limited time on the ice, and classmate Connor Riley was trying to follow in the footsteps of his brother, John Riley ’10. Then there was highly-touted incoming freshman Michalek, from Glastonbury, Conn.
Despite bringing with him an impressive list of accomplishments—including playing for the U.S. National Under-18 team and being drafted by the Minnesota Wild—the transition to college hockey is never an easy one, and not much was expected of Michalek, at least not so soon.
But now, 18 games into another disappointing Crimson campaign, the New England native has emerged as a potentially long-term solution in goal, starting all but three games and staying on the ice for 90 percent of Harvard’s minutes.
His 3.05 goals against per game and .895 save percentage certainly leave room for improvement, but if nothing else, Michalek gives Donato and this program a stable and consistent play for the foreseeable future, a prospect it hasn’t had since Richter played in 18 games as a freshman.
Add to the equation the play of fellow freshmen Patrick McNally and Colin Blackwell, who are currently third and sixth, respectively, on the team in points, and there is reason for optimism amongst the Harvard faithful going forward.
With eleven regular season games left, including the Beanpot, Michalek will have ample opportunity to cement his position as the starter going into next year. At a program that boasts 21 Ivy League Championships and 12 Frozen Four appearances, individual and team performances are measured against a high standard.
This season is certainly not unsalvageable, but the team’s progress, particularly that of Michalek, in these coming weeks may well determine the immediate future of the program. A strong finish could put Michalek on track to become one of the Crimson’s all-time greats and allow this team to finally live up to its potential. A weak one, coupled with a return to the between-the-pipes instability of the past, could put Harvard back at square one, which would put increased pressure on Donato and the athletic department to reinvigorate a once-proud program.

At a program that boasts 21 Ivy League Championships and 12 Frozen Four appearances, individual and team performances are measured against a high standard.
This season is certainly not unsalvageable, but the team’s progress, particularly that of Michalek, in these coming weeks may well determine the immediate future of the program. A strong finish could put Michalek on track to become one of the Crimson’s all-time greats and allow this team to finally live up to its potential. A weak one, coupled with a return to the between-the-pipes instability of the past, could put Harvard back at square one, which would put increased pressure on Donato and the athletic department to reinvigorate a once-proud program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The unfortunate case of football recruit Yuri Wright, who was expelled from Don Bosco Prep for racially and sexually insensitive tweets, may be an extreme example of the misuse of social media, but it should serve as a reminder to all of us to take caution with what we write.
Wright, who lost the interest of the University of Michigan following his tweets but has since committed to the University of Colorado, is hardly the first athlete to get in trouble through Twitter, and it’s not surprising that his choice of words had consequences.
But many athletes have landed themselves in trouble for far less obviously offensive comments. During the NFL lockout, for example, Reggie Bush tweeted "I’m making the most of [the lockout]! Vacation, rest, relaxing, appearances here and there! I’m good! Right about now we would be slaving in 100 degree heat, practicing twice a day, while putting our bodies at risk for nothing." Bush meant it as a tease, responding to subsequent criticism by saying, "[The] tweet was a joke!" He might have even thought he was showing a positive attitude by highlighting what he saw as the "bright side" of an unfortunate situation. But many fans were disappointed by what they saw as a sense of entitlement.
Athletes have long been making ill-advised comments to the media, but in earlier days, they seemed to be the victims. It was the reporters who clawed for sound bites; athletes were simply foolish enough to respond. One could even cry foul by claiming one’s words were taken out of context. These are still issues, of course, but social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, give athletes the opportunity to take a much more active role in hurting their reputation. And while athletes, such as Wright, can seek to defend themselves by saying that their feeds were protected, ultimately it was their unprovoked decision to post what they did on the web.
That is not to say that all athletes use Twitter irresponsibly. Some use it quite well as a way to communicate with their fans.
Here at Harvard, we would all do well to remember the consequences other athletes have faced. Although most of us may not have athletic careers as decorated as Bush’s, attaching the Harvard name to our accomplishments makes us very visible. And just like professional football players, Harvard students are considered to be extremely privileged.
It is easy to see how seemingly innocuous Facebook statuses or Twitter posts on the struggles of problem sets and papers could rub some the wrong way, much in the same way that Bush’s tweet did. While students could admit that they do appreciate the gifts of a Harvard education and that they simply vented in a moment of frustration, the fact again remains that they made a choice to release to the public something that was unprovoked by reporters.
While I don’t have a Twitter, I often find myself nervous about how something I write might reflect upon my team. Most of the Crimson’s staff writers are not athletes, but there are a group of us, perhaps unsurprisingly concentrated in the sports board, that balance working for an independent newspaper with the responsibilities of representing our teams well.
While I don’t think that most people reading my articles know that I am a rower, I am always worried about how my work will reflect not only on myself but also on my team.
When Bush and Wright voiced thoughts best kept to themselves, they hurt themselves more than they hurt either of their teams. The same goes for Harvard students—athletes or otherwise—who choose to say stupid things in public whether vocally or online. It’s happened many times, and the University has always survived.
As pseudo-public personas, we must take care to acknowledge that our actions and words can have repercussions beyond our control.
No one’s perfect. From time to time, we all say things we wish we could retract. But there’s no reason why those words need to be read by others. As someone once said, a slip of the pen is much harder to defend than a slip of the tongue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Harvard men’s basketball team traveling to New Haven Friday night to take on the Bulldogs in what has been billed as the Ivy League’s premier matchup, we caught up with The Yale Daily News’ Charles Condro to get the inside scoop on Yale basketball. Check out what Condro had to say below:
The Harvard Crimson: What can Harvard expect from Yale this Friday?
 
Charles Condro: First of all, Harvard can expect to be challenged defensively. Yale has the Twin Towers in Greg Mangano '12 and Jeremiah Kreisberg '14. The Crimson just isn't as vertically gifted as the Bulldogs. On the other end of the height spectrum, guard Austin Morgan '13 can shoot the lights out. When the Elis play their best basketball they can compete with anyone, but they do have a tendency to look sluggish in the opening minutes of halves. 
THC: Is Greg Mangano a legitimate NBA prospect?
CC: If you watch the NBA draft you know that a lot of people get drafted for their physical gifts rather than their skill set (ask Scottie Reynolds). Mangano has NBA height (6'10") that makes him an attractive prospect. He is a light 240lbs though, but you can add muscle whereas you can't make yourself taller. He is lanky but plays strong around the rim, has a knack for rebounding and NBA range from beyond the arc. Possibly the best compliment he got was from Florida coach Billy Donovan when he called him "awkward." He's no Dirk, but he gets his shot off in the same awkward, unblockable, frustrating way. Look for him to come off the board late in the second round, and, even if he doesn't, he will get some attention as an undrafted free agent.
 
THC: What should Harvard students traveling to New Haven for the game look out for on Friday night? Is Toad's throwing down?
CC: Any Crimson ladies looking for a good time can contact me personally. The 10,000 boys of Harvard should go here. Yalies, however, will be throwing down on the court in the Lee Amphitheater after the self-proclaimed "Goon Squad" restores order to the Ancient Eight.
 
THC: Greg Mangano and Austin Morgan obviously get a lot of attention, and it seems like Reggie Willhite flies under the radar a little bit. What does Willhite bring to the team?
CC: First of all, Willhite brings style (respect the mohawk). On the court he is a lockdown defender (t-27 nationwide in steals). Offensively he can use his strength and quickness to attack the rim, and his shot improved after working with Grant Hill and Christian Laettner this summer. Most importantly, he can spark the team and ignite a run: well-timed steals that lead to breakaway slams in crunch time are a Willhite trademark.
 
THC: Now that nearly half of Yale's football coaching staff is from Harvard, do you think you guys can stop the five-game losing streak next year?
CC: I'm not sure if they teach counting up there in Cambridge, but Yale still leads overall 65-55-8, and 65>55. While Reno, Conlin, Wilmot and Barber have all seen the light and the truth, Yale students consoled themselves after this year's disaster by remembering that they actually get to enjoy their college experience, rather than having to spend four years in a library with a bunch of Harvard students. Overall, I think it's safe to say that Reno will bring a W back to New Haven (we're bound to win one eventually).
THC: We've heard a lot about New Haven's pizza. Where is the best spot to get a slice late night?
CC: Forget pizza, get Wenzels. Seriously though, the pizza is good. Yorkside and A1 are open late, and reportedly taste good even when you're sober. The fancier pizza parlors like Pepe's and Bar are excellent, but they have standards for their customers.
THC: Final score prediction:
CC: Bluntly, the key is for Yale to put the ball in the basket. The Crimson defense has somehow managed to be fourth in the nation in points against per game despite being made up entirely of Harvard students. With that said, I believe (with some bias) that Yale will be able to break 60 points and beat Harvard, 63-58. The Bulldogs have the ability to do it; the question is whether or not they will be able to string together two solid halves and seal the deal.

After being bested by Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah for the past two years, Harvard regained its position atop of U.S. News and World Report's rankings as the most popular national university among college applicants.
BYU came in a close second with a yield of 74.7 percent.
U.S. News and World Report analyzed yield rates, the percentage of accepted applicants at a given university who choose to attend, to determine the rankings of these universities. U.S. News and World Report describes eligible universities as "research-oriented institutions that offer degrees of all levels." Liberal arts colleges had separate rankings. 
 In a press release, Dean of Admissions William R. Fitzsimmons attributed Harvard's popularity to its extensive financial aid program and to the recently enhanced support that students receive once enrolled.
Though the recent ranking was based on the yield rates for the class of 2014, which at Harvard was 75.5 percent, the yield rate for the class of 2015 was even higher: 75.9 percent. It looks like Harvard will do well in next year's rankings. 
Additionally, the reintroduction of early action at Harvard will likely affect the yield rate for the class of 2016. 
Stanford University, Yeshiva University, and the University of Alaska Fairbanks rounded out the top five in the rankings.
Yale grabbed the eighth spot, with a 65.91 percent yield.
Of the liberal arts colleges, the United States Naval, Military, and Air Force Academies, as well as Savannah State University and Berea College all had higher yields than Harvard.
Harvard also currently sits atop U.S. News and World Report's Best Universities ranking.

Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren took her campaign for Massachusetts junior U.S. Senator onto the airways Tuesday night with an important message. "The Pats are gonna spank the Giants," Warren declared on "The Daily Show" with Jon Stewart.
"I'm sorry," she said. "It's just reality."
Warren's Tuesday appearance on the popular comedy show was not her first. She has appeared as a guest before to discuss her work with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Congressional Oversight Panel.
But Tuesday night's appearance was Warren's first since she declared her candidacy for U.S. Senate last fall. The race between Warren and Republican candidate Scott P. Brown is expected to attract a lot of national attention in coming months.
Although Warren traded jokes and Super Bowl predictions with Stewart, she made sure to address tax policy, lobbying, and investment—the touchstone issues of her campaign thus far.
"It's a big and systemic problem here," Warren said of the United States' taxation policies. "I grew up in an America that was still investing in the middle class. That was the principal function of Washington and how it spent money. It said 'we're going to invest in America's middle class.' It's how kids like me, the daughter of some guy who sold fencing, ended up as a professor."
"You didn't know his name?" Stewart said.

If you're still unsure about classes, take a look at some of these steadfast courses that are popular year after year. Although they may not be the easiest, without fail, these classes consistently fill up lecture halls. Of course, some of these courses are so popular that they've already been lotteried...so keep these in mind for next year as well.
1. Science of Living Systems 20: "Psychological Science"
Offered in both the fall and the spring, this course has consistently drawn masses of students each semester. After all, who doesn't want to learn the psychology of makeup?
2. Economics 1010b: "Macroeconomic Theory"
Popular among Economics concentrators, Ec 1010b usually has an enrollment of around 300 students. And with 9 a.m. lecture, that's saying something.
3. Sociology 190: "Life and Death in the US: Medicine and Disease in Social Context"
This class, taught by the popular Professor of Sociology Nicholas A. Christakis, focuses on how biological and social factors combine and impact health. According to the Q Guide last year, 93 percent of students said that they would recommend the class.
4. Chemistry 20: "Organic Chemistry"
Even though students often dread Orgo, Chem 20 proves that the pay-off is in the challenge. Professor Ryan M. Spoering has a reputation of keeping this class organized and well-run.
5. Human Evolutionary Biology 1310: "Hormones and Behavior"
Want to know how hormones drive human behavior? Consider HEB 1310. Sixty-one percent of students recommended this class "with enthusiasm" according to the Q Guide, and Professor Carole K. Hooven has received high ratings over the past years.
6. Statistics 104: "Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics"
With a lighter workload than other classes, and a funny, engaging lecturer, Stat 104 is popular among students. It's also a good way to knock out your Empirical & Mathematical Reasoning General Education requirement.
7. Government 1295: "Comparative Politics in Latin America"
Known for the popular fall course Government 20, Professor Steven Levitsky also teaches this spring class centered on Latin American revolutions. The course has received high Q scores for many years running.
8. Societies of the World 24: "Global Health Challenges: Complexities of Evidence-Based Policy"
This foundational Global Health & Health Policy course is a popular choice among students. The class focuses on malnutrition, disease, and other health risks and how countries respond to these problems. Lotteries have closed for this course, but the website assures that it will be offered again next year.
9. Expository Writing 40: "Public Speaking Practicum"
Expos 40 really is a "tried and true" course. Sectioning is closed for this semester, but the class deserves special mention in this list nonetheless. Generally the course requires that all interested students attend an introductory meeting early in shopping week, so be aware for next time around. It's worth checking out; 93 percent of students recommended the class "with enthusiasm."
10. Folklore and Mythology 90i: "Fairy Tales and Fantasy Literature"
This class on fairytales fills its 32 spots up fast. Although it's too late for the lottery this semester, consider it for next year. Reading Harry Potter and fulfilling a Gen Ed? Yes, please!

Ice skating is cool, but ice skating with the knowledge that s'mores are available (for free) nearby is even cooler. Beginning tomorrow evening, Harvard Skate is introducing "Skate & S'mores," a weekly event that is set to take place each Friday and continue through Mar. 2, weather permitting. Skating will be open from 6 p.m. - 9 p.m., but fire pits for roasting marshmallows will close an hour earlier at 8 p.m. Harvard Skate is funded by the Common Spaces Program.
