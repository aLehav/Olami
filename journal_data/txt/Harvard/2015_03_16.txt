After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Set in Tampa, Florida, during World War II, Dennis Lehane’s novel “World Gone By” is driven by plotting that offers a brief and cathartic escape from the often repetitive reality of daily life. As Lehane’s career makes abundantly clear—with novels like “Mystic River,” “Shutter Island,” and “Gone, Baby, Gone” that were all adapted into films—his books are practically written to resemble screenplays. "World Gone By" is no exception to this trend. It is a trip into the dark, mysterious world of Mafia boss Joe Coughlin and his associated crime families. While Lehane’s work is balanced by some truly beautiful descriptions of character that lie beneath what seems like a mere beach read, it ultimately rests on a series of cheap thrills, twists, and gunfire.
As it narrates the story of Coughlin’s dealings in the criminal underworld, the novel skillfully builds up to each moment of action. While Lehane reveals to the reader Coughlin’s immoral actions, though, he also imbues Coughlin with a melancholy thoughtfulness, often focused upon Coughlin’s thoughts on family. In Coughlin’s line of work, death is an inevitability. As he considers a murder he commits, he thinks about the murdered man’s son: “By this time tomorrow night, his bed would feel alien…. He would never have another conversation with his father. He would probably never know why his father was taken from him.” Despite Coughlin’s violent actions, Lehane convincingly and beautifully portrays him as a man who is not without compassion, vulnerabilities, and love.
In particular, Lehane offers a characterization of Coughlin that, while reserving judgment on his character, leaves out neither the brutality of his actions nor the tenderness of his interactions with his son. Coughlin describes his son’s deceased mother to him, saying, “Something I loved about your mother’s face was that whole world was in it. I’d look at her sometimes…. I’d see your ancestors crossing deserts and oceans or walking the streets of the Old City with puffy sleeves and swords in their scabbards.” Lehane seamlessly and persuasively weaves together Coughlin’s ruthlessness with his love for his son and friends. This combination, as Lehane gradually imbues his novel with an unshakeable feeling of paranoia and sadness, contributes to that sense of inevitable loss.
This complexity of character, however, remains limited. Despite the beautiful way in which Lehane presents Joe Coughlin, the greatest letdown of the work is that he does not develop the other characters throughout the novel. While Lehane is successful in opening up short, interesting side stories that relate to Coughlin’s narrative, he throws at the reader such a spread of characters that the personality and history of most of them, as well as their relationships with Coughlin, get a perfunctory treatment at best. This often feels disorienting and imparts to the novel a lack of continuity. Coughlin doesn’t change in a meaningful way, and this story isn’t so much about people as it is about the events and ordeals that happen to them. What Coughlin cared about and loved at the beginning of the novel he still values at the end. The emotional flavors that, in retrospect, should have colored many of the events throughout the novel—feeling like things are falling out of control, that too much time has passed, that things were simply left to fate—are notably absent. At times “World Gone By” becomes a parched landscape, which only further accentuates Lehane’s heavy reliance on plot.
Additionally, it’s hard to overlook the fact that some of Lehane’s writing simply feels like he is trying too hard to be believable. At times, he seems oppressive in his attempt to convince the reader of his character’s credibility as a mid-20th century gangster. The novel begins by describing a series of photographs: “Joe Coughlin again, in this one, shaking hands with the Negro gangster Montooth Dix. Boston Joe, rarely photographed his entire life, but that night, he was photographed twice. This guy smoking a cigarette by the dame in white? He’s dead. So’s that guy. The guy out on the dance floor in the white dinner jacket? He’s crippled.” This kind of narrative that presents killings or maimings as simple, almost casual, events gives the book an atmosphere in which brutal violence is discussed with seemingly irreverent levity. Ironically, this only makes the violence encountered more brutal. This effect, however, is seemingly unintentional.
This novel’s evident goal, however, is to provide an escape from reality, not to reflect reality itself. Lehane packs the novel to the brim with drama, and, while he sets up the thinking and emotions of the characters before a point of action, he leaves little time for the reader to reflect on all that occurred, either while reading the novel or at the end. "World Gone By” is a book that, while filled with entertaining action, ultimately doesn’t say much.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Erasmo Aragon is in limbo. His life is unraveling—he had quit his job and plans to leave his wife. He dreams of returning to El Salvador and making a new start in his former home but cannot yet realize that dream. His last paycheck hasn’t been delivered, his wife laments their young daughter’s future, and a persistent liver pain once thought to be cured has mysteriously returned to torment him. Hoping to alleviate the pain, he seeks the advice of Don Chente, a retired doctor. Yet before he completes his prescribed course of hypnosis, Chente himself disappears to El Salvador, leaving Aragon to ruminate on the memories dredged up by the treatment. This is Horacio Castellanos Moya's “The Dream of My Return.” In telling Aragon’s story, Castellanos Moya demonstrates his facility with the stream of consciousness narrative, masterfully depicting the psyche of an exiled journalist trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare of anxiety and paranoia.
Castellanos Moya's writing captures the inner workings of thought in slow motion. Aragon recollects an argument with his wife, Eva: “I asked her what was going on, assuring her that she could trust me and tell me what was tormenting her, though at no time had she mentioned that she was being tormented, nor had I witnessed any such torment; she sat up in bed, arranged the pillows behind her, and started by asking me to forgive her, without saying what I should forgive her for.” The sentence progresses as a drifting down through the many layers of Aragon’s increasing awareness of the moment until he realizes she has been cheating on him. Here, as throughout the novel, Aragon’s convoluted narration provides a framing that is somehow simultaneously nebulous and precise, evocative of a journey through one’s own remembrances.
The novel thrives on nuance, and the understated beauty of the language perfectly describes the internal musings of a journalist, a worker with words. For everyone except the narrator, Castellanos Moya eschews a complicated backstory, instead developing characters through their ways of being—speech patterns, attitudes, and so on. They float like vignettes on the canvas of the narrator's consciousness. Aragon's friend “Mr. Rabbit,” for instance, receives a cursory introduction as an ex-guerrilla; this role is solidified by later observations of his reticence in public and moments of extraordinary composure. “It’s no problem for me to do something like that, I learned how to a long time ago, out of necessity,” Mr. Rabbit reassures Aragon, who is overcome with guilt when the two begin to enact a revenge-murder plot.
Aragon's story unfolds as a string of memories, centered around his visits to Don Chente. Each week he approaches his appointment, cataloging the activities of the past week that he deems it best not to confide to his doctor, then leaves, contemplating the distant memories that the doctor asks him to recall. His life story becomes increasingly amorphous, an amalgamation of dream and reflection, suggesting that perhaps the whole tale is more fever dream than reality. While this technique may make the novel’s earliest pages to feel muddled, it quickly creates a rich, unpredictable, and captivating narrative landscape.
In this ever-shifting space, Castellanos Moya illuminates the extraordinary violence that characterized the narrator's Salvadoran childhood. Aragon’s first memory is of the bomb that destroyed the front of his grandparents home. In a matter-of-fact tone he recalls his second one: To punish a preschool classmate for stealing his blocks, Aragon took one of the remaining blocks and repeatedly smashed it into the head of the offender until the child began to scream in pain. The novel also incisively depicts the obsessiveness of the narrator's desire to start a new life, the heady, intoxicating quality of his plan to return to El Salvador; the most ambitious moments of dreaming coincide with his compulsive consumption of vodka tonics, while doubts regarding the trip arise only in the depths of a hangover.
The writing is possessed by a dark sense of humor, exemplified by the irony of the conclusions Aragon draws from his memories. After contemplating the block incident, he is pleased by the strength of his childhood self, determining that “It was obvious that from a tender age I had been able to react decisively to injustice.” Given his obvious unreliability as a narrator and unwillingness to straightforwardly approach his past, it is startling when additional forays into memory lead him to the smirk-inducing revelation, “It also became clear that memory is unreliable and can put one in rather a tight spot.”
So much has animated the book’s preceding pages—dreamy recollections of childhood, irrepressible hopes for transformation, tormented confrontations with anxieties past and present—that it is a shame for it all to fade into a scene of the narrator simply ogling a woman at the airport. As the multi-page ogle drags on, it is fortunately interrupted by a brief, illusory glimpse of Don Chente, perhaps returning from his own trio to El Salvador. Yet this satisfyingly disconcerting moment—like so many others in Castellanos Moya’s work—could shine on its own without needing to feel like an afterthought to the banality of the previous scene.
Though one would still hope for the last moments to deliver some sort of meaning or intensification of previous themes, “The Dream of My Return” is not the sort of story that demands a tidying of loose ends. It may end with a whimper, unfortunately, but this is an otherwise brilliant novel.

With Selection Sunday just around the corner, the Harvard men’s basketball team will know who it will be matched up with in the round of 64 of the NCAA tournament soon enough. But sometimes speculation is more fun than reality, so we at The Back Page decided to look at what we consider to be the Crimson’s potential opponents in the NCAA tournament and to try and speculate what chance—if any—Harvard will have at pulling the upset.
Record: 26-7, 13-5 SEC
Best Wins:  #20 SMU, Dayton
Worst Loss:  Clemson, Tennessee
RPI: 17
Ken Pomeroy Ranking: 29
Projected Seed (from ESPN’s Joe Lunardi): 5
Star Players: Bobby Portis (So. Forward) 17.7 ppg, 8.8 rpg; Michael Qualis (Jr. Guard) 15.4 ppg, 5.4 rpg
Harvard should become acquainted with the name Bobby Portis.
The sophomore has been one of the most productive players in the nation this year. He was named to the Wooden Award Late Season Top 20 List. He’s averaged almost 18 points per game and over eight boards per contest, and is projected to go in the first round of the NBA Draft by many experts.
His partner-in-crime is junior guard Michael Qualis, who also has been a consistent scorer and has cleaned up on the boards. Together, they’ll be a tough duo to stop down low, with heights of 6’11” and 6’6”, respectively. In its late season loss and postseason win against Yale, Harvard lost the battle on the glass. The Crimson’s frontcourt of co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and sophomore Zena Edosomwan will need to match up well against the Razorback duo.
Arkansas finished in second place in the SEC–a conference that is often maligned for its lack of depth in quality teams behind No. 1 Kentucky. They also made it to the conference championship on Sunday before losing to the Wildcats for the second time on the season.
One knock on Arkansas is that the team plays much better at home than on the road. Bud Walton Arena is one of the toughest places to play in the country, as the Razorbacks went 17-2 in Little Rock this season. The team is only 7-5 on the road, however.
The Razorbacks are 8-4 against the RPI top 50 this season, including a win over No. 20 Southern Methodist. The team has come up short against Tennessee and Clemson, who are ranked 98th and 103rd in the RPI, respectively. Harvard sits tied for No. 53 in the RPI.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 15, 2015, at 9:25 p.m.
On Thursday, Harvard hoops will face collegiate basketball royalty when it takes the floor in its fourth-consecutive NCAA Tournament, squaring off against North Carolina in the second round of the Big Dance at 7:20 p.m. eastern time.
The Crimson, which received a No. 13 seed, will travel to Jacksonville, Fla. for its matchup with the No. 4-seeded Tar Heels (24-11, 11-7 ACC), a squad that fell just short of the ACC Title on Saturday evening.
“[W]e are thrilled to represent our great conference in the NCAA Tournament,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “[W]hat an opponent for us. We can’t say enough about the excitement that this tournament brings for everyone…. We’re excited to keep going, and I think these guys are going to be excited to get ready for an incredible program and team that has done amazing things through the years.”
While Harvard (22-7, 11-3 Ivy) and UNC haven’t faced against each other in decades, Amaker, nevertheless, considers himself familiar with the Tar Heel system. As a former Duke player and assistant coach, Amaker has gained both knowledge and “appreciation” of his alma mater’s rival program, which he calls “as good as any” in the nation.
For the Crimson, controlling the paint and limiting second-chance opportunities will be key on Thursday. Featuring a coterie of talented, lengthy big men, the Tar Heels rank second in the country in rebounds per game at 41.0, with forwards Brice Johnson and Kennedy Meeks leading the squad from inside, averaging a combined 15.2 boards per contest.
On the other side of the court, UNC relies on a balanced attack in its fast-tempo offense, with four players averaging double-digit scoring for the season. Behind point guard Marcus Paige, who paces the team with 13.9 points per contest while shooting at a 38.6 percent clip from deep, the Tar Heels aim to push the ball on the break, and currently sit at 17th in the nation at 77.9 points per outing.
Both co-captain Steve Moundou-Missi and Amaker cited UNC’s activity on the boards and speed in transition as integral to what Amaker deemed “the Carolina system.”
“Their front line [is] long, deep, [and] absolutely terrific on the backboard,” Amaker explained. “[T]hey are [terrific] in transition—and we like to play that way as well, so [we have] similar philosophies in that regard. But certainly their transition game will be a bear to defend.”
The Selection Sunday news came just 24 hours after the Crimson clinched its bid to the tournament, punching its ticket in a come-from-behind thriller in which it defeated Yale, 53-51, thanks to a deep jumper from Moundou-Missi with just under eight ticks to play.
Following Saturday’s win, University President Drew G. Faust reached out to the team to express her support and her congratulations. Faust, who is currently in Beijing, woke up at 4 a.m. local time and checked the score of the Harvard-Yale game online, at which point Harvard was leading, 19-18.
“Harvard's victory over Yale in Philadelphia is a tribute to the perseverance and grit of the entire team and to the leadership of Coach Amaker, who has engineered an unprecedented record of success,” Faust said in a statement. “I was excited to learn about their achievement when I woke up this morning in Beijing, and immediately emailed Coach Amaker to congratulate him and the players. I look forward to cheering them on as they compete in the Big Dance for the fourth year in a row.
The last two seasons, the Crimson has played the role of Cinderella on the biggest stage of collegiate hoops, upsetting New Mexico and Cincinnati in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The squad came close to busting millions of brackets last season when it staged a 16-point comeback in the Round of 32 against popular title favorite Michigan State, taking the lead for a few moments late in the contest.
For years, Amaker has instilled in his team a mantra of sorts, one that stresses that the team’s “internal standards” trump any “external expectations” put forth by the white noise of the media or anyone else outside the closed circle of the locker room.
For the seniors—a group that has witnessed the program’s first tournament berth since 1946, the first March Madness win in school history, and its first AP preseason top-25 ranking—this season’s Big Dance will be their final chance to embody Amaker’s hardwood philosophy. It will be their final opportunity to “carry on” the recent success of the program, as senior wing Wesley Saunders phrased it—trying one last time to don the Cinderella slipper, with the single goal of busting brackets when it takes on the storied Tar Heels program in Jacksonville this Thursday.
“It just means everything really,” Saunders said. “This was the dream that we all had when we came to Harvard, to have this level of success, and just to be able to see it all happen has been great. We’ve worked so hard for all of this…and it’s just a testament to all of our hard work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW HAVEN, Conn.—Jimmy Vesey has a flair for the dramatic. Sunday at Ingalls Rink, the junior scoring specialist’s eyes “lit up” when he saw his chance to end the longest game in Harvard history.
In the 97th minute of a decisive Game 3, Vesey punched in a double-overtime winner to beat No. 12/12 Yale, 3-2, and send the No. 18/- Crimson men’s ice hockey team (19-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) to the ECAC tournament semifinals.
“Luckily I beat my man off the wall, and my eyes lit up when I saw [the puck],” Vesey said.
With just over three minutes remaining in the second overtime period, the junior forward picked up a rebound from fourth-year defenseman Patrick McNally off the right pad of Bulldog sophomore goaltender Alex Lyon and lifted it blocker-side.
“It truly was a series that nobody deserved to lose,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “This was...an epic struggle for both teams.”
Sixth-seeded Harvard will play top-seeded Quinnipiac in the semifinal round at Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., on Friday with a chance to advance to the conference final on Saturday.
The Bulldogs (18-9-5, 12-6-4), meanwhile, finish their tournament having beaten Harvard four times this year, but two losses on home ice this weekend leave coach Keith Allain’s team 18th in the PairWise Rankings, outside of an unlikely at-large NCAA berth. The Crimson had entered the weekend without a win at Yale since 2005.
“It was a big mental hurdle, I think, to win the series,” Donato said.
Harvard cleared its biggest hurdle late in the third period.
Trailing, 2-1, late in regulation, the Crimson had struggled to pressure a smothering Yale defense that held the visitors to two shots on goal in the first 12 minutes of the frame. The Bulldogs entered the night undefeated (17-0-1) this season when leading after two periods, while Harvard (0-9-1) had yet to win a game while trailing after two periods.
But with under four minutes to play, Harvard received a spark from a combination that would have seemed unlikely as early as three weeks ago.
Fourth-year forward Colin Blackwell, skating on the second line after returning from a long-term injury in the final weekend of the regular season, cut into the Yale zone and created space at the left point for McNally, who ripped a wrist shot through the legs of Lyon.
It was the first goal for McNally since Nov. 21. The top-pair defenseman had returned to the lineup this weekend after sustaining a serious leg injury at Cornell in late January.
“I really just never gave up hope and just took it one day at a time,” McNally said of his rehabilitation. “I focused on that, just getting better little bit by little bit.”
In overtime the Crimson would play without Blackwell, who was sidelined with cramps, but McNally continued to change the shape of the game. He skated away with a bloody forehead at 14:55 in the extra frame after a head-first hit into the Yale backboards by senior forward Matt Killian, who was assessed a five minute major and game disqualification for the play.
Harvard’s power play failed to convert on the major penalty, yet Donato remained positive heading into the fourth intermission.
“I went [into the locker room] and kind of joked and said, ‘You know what guys, we don’t want any excuses when we get this done anyway, so let’s do it five-on-five,’” Donato said.
Harvard survived two minor penalties in the fifth frame before McNally followed up his goal with a helper on Vesey’s game-winner. With 3:21 on the clock, Crimson sophomore Alex Kerfoot won a faceoff in the Yale zone out to McNally, who sent in a long wrist shot that Kerfoot tipped left on its way to Vesey.
Vesey, who leads Division I in goals per game with 27 strikes in 34 contests, also had the deciding third-period goal in the series opener on Friday.
“I said Friday’s was [the biggest goal of my career], but I think this one tops it by a long shot,” Vesey said.
Harvard’s only lead in regulation lasted 21 seconds in the first period.
After sophomore forward Tyler Moy slipped a close-angle unassisted strike under Lyon’s pads low in the right faceoff circle, the Bulldogs marched back on their next offensive possession.
On a rush, junior forward Carson Cooper sent an outside shot on Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek, who could not locate the puck at his skates before junior Cody Learned poked it through the crease to draw even at 10:22 in the first period.
In the next frame, Yale took a 2-1 lead on the power play as Frank DiChiara struck on a one-timer from the top of the right faceoff circle at 11:58.
That score would stand for over a period, largely due to the work of the netminders. Both Lyon and fourth-year Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek made game-saving stops throughout regulation and overtime.
Michalek (40 saves) swatted away a point-blank opportunity from Trent Ruffalo in the middle of the second period and stopped Cody Learned on a close second-chance opportunity in the first overtime.
Lyon (39 saves) forced sophomore forward Luke Esposito wide on a breakaway opportunity early in the overtime frame and provided multiple impressive stops, including one on junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo with 18.9 seconds left in the first extra frame.
“With all the emotional ups and downs with the power plays and the penalty kills, Lyon probably made a dozen huge saves,” Donato said. “I told the guys after the game that I just feel humbled to be a part of it. I was just very, very proud of our effort and our perseverance.”
Harvard now sits 15th in the PairWise Rankings with a chance next weekend to earn its first conference championship and NCAA tournament berth since 2006.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For sophomore thrower Nikki Okwelogu, an indoor season filled with success, titles, and records came to an end in the same manner which many of her previous competitions had finished—with another broken Ivy League record.
Competing at the NCAA Indoor National Championships at the University of Arkansas, Okwelogu improved on her Ancient Eight shot put record with a mark of 17.22 meters—0.10 meters further than her previous record. The throw was the first of the day for the entire field and established the Fresno, Calif. native as an early dark horse in the competition.
“I thought she competed incredibly well,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “To go into her first national championship at the NCAA level, going in seeded ninth and come out with a sixth place performance as well as another school and Ivy League record is just an awesome accomplishment.”
The feat didn’t just earn her another record, however, as the sophomore ended up placing sixth in the field, garnering First Team Indoor All-American Honors—the first Harvard women to do so since sophomore Martina Salander and Adabelle Ekechukwu ’14 both did so in 2013.
Okwelogu opened the day with her record-breaking throw, good enough to place her in third overall in the prelims and advance her to the finals. The sophomore’s first throw ended up being her best of the day, which gave her a sixth-place finish. In the process, Okwelogu was able to overcome injury concerns that had been bothering her coming into the competition.
“I was dealing with some ankle issues leading up to [the throw] during warm-ups,” Okwelogu said. “I realized my ankle was getting worse with each throw…so I put everything I had especially during that first throw because I knew every [subsequent] throw made my ankle worse.”
The sophomore came into the competition ranked ninth in the nation distance-wise after her performance at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships two weeks earlier.
Okwelogu has established herself as the most prolific shot putter in Ancient Eight history, as she has set a new record in almost every week she has competed this season.
The sophomore has made a strong impact on the program from the beginning of her collegiate career, claiming the school record in the event as a freshman. The sophomore didn’t just limit herself to becoming the best shot-putter in Crimson history, as she took the Ivy League by storm as well.
Prior to this season, the conference shot put record belonged to Debbie St. Phard of Princeton, who had held the then-record mark of 16.28 meters for 28 years. Okwelogu broke that record earlier this season at the Crimson Elite Meet with a mark of 16.39 meters.
This would prove to be the start of a streak of broken marks for the sophomore, as Okwelogu broke her record for the following three competitions in a row, including her mark on Saturday.
“Nikki’s progression is a culmination of consistent hard work,” Saretsky said. “She got great experience last summer being able to represent Nigeria in several international competitions and got a taste of what it’s like to compete at a high level.”
With the indoor season now behind her, Okwelogu will prepare herself for the outdoor season, where the sophomore looks to qualify for the NCAA Outdoor National Championships in June and make an impact in the discus as well as the shot put.
Considering her performance this weekend, there is reason to believe that Okwelogu could have an even bigger impact in the outdoor portion of the season.
“If I can stay relatively within the distance I throw now, I know that will be good enough to make it for shot put again,” Okwelogu said. “With discus…I’ve been throwing to a net for the past two months, so if I’m throwing as far as I think I am, I definitely have a shot at Nationals for discus as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard softball team suffered five consecutive losses in the San Diego Classic II tournament this weekend to open its 12-game spring break trip in California.
The Crimson (3-9) had to play from behind this weekend against a handful of teams that began playing games in early February and had nearly three times as much game experience as Harvard up to this point.
“We traditionally play a very tough preseason schedule,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We want to play a tough schedule. We want to be battle tested. We want to learn how to succeed and we are getting tested right now.”
UTAH STATE 1, HARVARD 0
The Crimson’s seven hits matched its hit total from the previous two games, but the team failed to plate a run for the third consecutive game, spoiling the strong pitching performances of sophomore Taylor Cabe and senior Laura Ricciardone.
In the sixth inning, Harvard rallied to put runners on second and third with nobody out in one last attempt to even the score. But the Crimson could not capitalize, and the offense sputtered with a pop out, an out at the plate on a wild pitch, and a groundout to third.
Utah State (7-16) capitalized with the bases loaded in the fourth inning when second baseman Victoria Saucedo scored on a fielder’s choice to give the Aggies the only run it needed for the win.
SAN JOSE STATE 3, HARVARD 0
Spartans senior Madison Fish surrendered just two hits en route to a complete game shutout against the Crimson on the hill for San Jose State (19-11).
Ricciardone could not keep pace with Fish but only scattered three runs and eight hits over seven innings. Ricciardone minimized the damage in the first and seventh innings with timely outs to strand a pair of runners in each.
“Defensively, I thought we learned how to be really tough with runners on base,” Allard said. “We had a lot of innings where we had runners on base, and I think we really learned how to bear down in that situation.”
SANTA CLARA 3, HARVARD 0
In the bottom of the third inning, the Broncos strung together five singles to plate two runs and break a scoreless tie. Santa Clara (8-19) added a run in the fourth to take a decisive 3-0 lead.
Junior Morgan Groom shut out the Broncos in two innings of work to keep Harvard in the game. The Crimson had runners on first and second in the seventh inning with the tying run at the plate, but sophomore third baseman Catherine Callaway grounded into a double play to end the game.
NEW MEXICO STATE 7, HARVARD 2
The Crimson fell behind early, as the Aggies (22-9) rallied for five singles and four runs before Harvard recorded an out in the first inning. New Mexico State built its lead to seven by the top of the fourth inning.
In the bottom of the fourth, junior shortstop Haley Davis smacked a two-run home run coming off the bench to put the Crimson on the scoreboard. But Harvard did not take advantage of two consecutive walks immediately after the homer and failed to overcome the team’s early deficit.
WEBER STATE 3, HARVARD 2
After going down quietly in its half of the eighth inning, the Crimson faced a bases-loaded, one-out situation playing defense against the Aggies. Harvard nearly escaped, but sophomore left fielder Mackenzie Corta hit a two-out single down the line to lift the Wildcats past the Crimson by a run in a walk-off.
Harvard had its only lead in the tournament after it broke a scoreless tie in the sixth inning of the game. After senior Katie Lantz reached first on an error and advanced to second on a single by fellow senior Katherine Appelbe, a single from Callaway and fielding error by Weber State second baseman McKinley Brinkerhoff allowed both seniors to score.
Ricciardone held the Wildcats to no runs in five innings of work, but Groom surrendered Harvard’s lead by giving up two runs in relief in the sixth.
“The fact that all of these teams have 10-plus games under their belts, and we are competing is promising for our success this season,” Ricciardone said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After almost reaching half of its 2014 11-win output with five victories in the first eight games of the season, the Harvard baseball team saw its offense sputter in a four-game series against Stetson (12-9) to kick off spring break for the Crimson (5-7).
Harvard scored just six runs in the four-game set against the Hatters after plating 25 in its previous series at Mercer. The schedule does not offer the Crimson much respite, however, as the team now moves on to play six more games in the next week in Florida.
STETSON 6, HARVARD 2
Senior righthander Tanner Anderson was almost a one-man show for the Crimson in the final tilt of the weekend. The Tampa, Fla. native threw six strong innings, giving up four runs—two earned—and had two of Harvard’s seven hits hitting out of the six-hole.
However, the Crimson offense struggled to string together hits for the third-straight day, as no one else in the lineup had a multi-hit day.
The Hatters elected to tackle the pitching game by committee, with starter Evin Lynch only going three and two-thirds innings despite giving up just one run. Four more Stetson pitchers—none of whom recorded more than six outs—kept the Harvard offense quiet.
On the defensive end, the Crimson did not do itself any favors, recording twice as many errors as runs scored.
STETSON 14, HARVARD 1
Though the Crimson pitching staff recorded five goose eggs on the scoreboard, there were also three crooked numbers that contributed to a Hatters blowout. A half inning after Harvard put up its first and only run of the game to narrow the gap to 5-1 in the seventh, Stetson batted around and then some, plating nine runs on nine hits against Harvard junior relievers Sean O’Neill and T.J. Laurisch.
The Crimson’s one through four hitters finished 1-for-14 on the day. And, outside of senior second baseman Jake McGuiggan’s RBI double, Harvard could not break through against Hatters starter Adam Schaly, who picked up his third win of the season on the hill.
Crimson senior starter Matt Timoney labored in his 110-pitch, five and two-thirds innings start, giving up five runs on eight hits to fall to 2-1 on the season.
STETSON 15, HARVARD 2
After strong early-season starts of six and seven and a third innings, sophomore righthander Nick Gruener struggled in just two-plus innings of work. The Hatters sent him to an early exit, recording eight runs on eight hits against the Miami, Fla. native.
By the third inning, Stetson had broken things wide open with a 10-run lead, and led by what would be the final score by the sixth. And though the Crimson offense hat nine hits and drew six walks on the day, the group also stranded 13 runners, with three hitters stranding at least three. The loss dropped Harvard to .500 for the season.
STETSON 8, HARVARD 1
Junior righty Sean Poppen was pitching to contact in game one of the series. More than 50 of his 84 pitches were in the strike zone, and the Chesapeake, Va. native did not record a strikeout or a walk in five and a third innings on the bump. In what turned out to be a precursor of the games to come, the Hatters struck early and often, recording three runs in the first and another in the third off Poppen to take the early lead.
The biggest performance of the day came from the arm of Stetson starting pitcher Brooks Wilson, who earned his fifth win of the season with a masterful complete game. Wilson scattered six singles and a double and did not walk a batter despite hurling 115 pitches.
Senior utilityman Ethan Ferreira had the Crimson’s lone run batted in on a double in the fourth inning to plate sophomore infielder Drew Reid.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking a 7-5 lead headed into halftime against the fifth-ranked team in the nation, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (2-2) saw Syracuse (7-2) power its way back into the game to take the contest, 11-10.
In a less than two minute span, the Orange surpassed the Crimson with three consecutive goals to take an 8-7 lead with 25:47 remaining. Led by goals from freshman midfielder Nekele McCall and sophomore midfielder Maeve McMahon, Harvard remained within one headed into the final 11 minutes of play.
Strong defense ruled the day for the next 10 minutes, as neither team could find the back of the net. But that changed with less than 90 seconds remaining, when Syracuse’s Ella Thorpe netted an insurance goal on her only shot of the day to put the Orange up two.
In what was also her first and only shot of the day, the Crimson’s Alexis Nicolia scored after drawing control of the ball to pull Harvard within one with just under a minute remaining.
The Crimson made things interesting in the final sequence, with Emma Ford picking up a ground ball with 48 seconds remaining. The ensuing action eventually led to McMahon, who finished the contest with a game-high three goals, taking a shot at Syracuse goaltender Kelsey Richardson with 35 ticks to go.
And with her fourth save of the day, Richardson staved off the potential equalizer to clinch the victory for the Orange.
On the opposite end of the field, Harvard junior goalie Kelly Weis had a busy day in the net, stopping 12 of the the 23 shots that came her way to set a season high for saves.
Both teams tied in first-half shots with 13. However, Syracuse came out of the break with those three quick goals, and outshot the Crimson by a tally of 13-9 in the second half.
Sophomore attack Marisa Romeo and junior midfielder Audrey Todd both finished with two goals on four shots apiece.
The game against the Orange was the second ranked team the Crimson has faced this year; earlier in the month, Harvard fell by a score of 13-9 to No. 8 Virginia.
