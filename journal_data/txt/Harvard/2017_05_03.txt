After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since last week Thursday, no Harvard College student has attended any regular class. Far from a collective game of hookie by the student body, this is the College’s spring reading period, an allotment of six to seven days after the end of classes and before exams. Students can use this unstructured and unprogrammed time to decompress, catch up with friends, study for exams, and take a deep breath before another whirlwind school year finishes flying by.
Though the observation of reading period may seem like an immutable law to Harvard students, it is not the norm for all universities, and can vary wildly. Other schools have a mere “Reading Day,” hardly cushioning the transition from regular class to examinations. The length is not even uniform across the Ivy League: Columbia has three “Study Days,” whereas Princeton tops Harvard with an eight day break. Our arch-enemies in Connecticut have a comparable week-long period.
Duration aside, there are many choices that factor into the experience of reading period and of which many Harvard students may not even be aware. Just four years ago, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to restructure reading period in order to alleviate the stressors many students faced during it. Regular classes—with the exception of language-intensive courses—are no longer allowed to gather, essays must be due no earlier than the fourth day of reading period, and no new content may be assigned to students after the end of classes.
The benefits of Harvard’s practices are evident. If students are not given the time to relax, catch their breath between assignments, and prepare thoroughly for exams, they will likely not be able to produce their best work. Even if they do, it may come at the expense of their mental well being and with undue stress. Providing flexibility in students’ schedules gives them the ability to leverage their time and make progress on their assignments as they see fit instead of toiling through their typical academic lineup.
Reading period, however, is not a purely academic experience. It would be lamentable, if not impossible, for a Harvard student to have enough schoolwork to fill an entire week. Many use the time to explore the Greater Boston area, catch up with friends, or even do some recreational rather than academic reading. In some cases, leisure activities are sponsored by the College: many Houses hold their formal dances during reading period, inviting students to the biggest parties of the year the week before they take exams that can count for up to 50 percent of their final grades.
Indeed, reading period captures many of the tensions, ironies, and contradictions of undergraduates’ experience at Harvard College. It has been designed, tweaked, and regulated by administrators, little to the knowledge of Harvard students. Final clubs’ music frequently echoes throughout Mount Auburn Street. Undergraduates are simultaneously told by the College to cloister themselves in the library and to strap on their formal wear for a dance, or to somehow find a way to reconcile the two. At the end of it all, some of us will engage in Primal Scream.
Most importantly, though, exams still seem far off. It’s reading period now, and we’re glad for it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Admittedly, this last iteration of The Underground started off much more political than it should have. I was intent on scolding academics and coastal elites for their clinical and condescending response to the November election, and not-so-gently mocking those intrepid social scientists and “experts” as self-righteous safari types who in the interest of “breaching the divide,” decide to venture into “middle America”—which, lo and behold, is also home to many liberals—to see how these strange creatures called conservatives live.
“Look! A wild conservative in their natural habitat! Let’s get closer and see what they’re up to. It’s been said that these creatures exhibit primitive behaviors like a love for firearms and Chick-fil-A…”
That column would have been more than a bit dramatic and more than a bit facetious. I do think it’s also quite problematic that many people have, at best, taken such a…scientific approach toward trying to understand “those other voters” and, at worst, written them off as useless hateful bigots. It’s as if one part of the country is peering through a microscope at a petri dish of something they only consider useful as statistical observations, and it’s not as if conservatives aren’t guilty of similar stigmatizing and stereotyping.
I am also complicit. I love to talk politics, people, policy; philosophize about the role of the state; and joke about politicians’ antics with anyone who’s willing to grab a meal with me. I’m a proud conservative, and I and others derive a peculiar thrill from being something of an underdog in collegiate politics. Those damn liberals!
But politics isn’t everything. It’s easy to talk about demographics and emotional and historic and ethnic factors and whatnot, but at the end of the day, none of them really tell us who we are as people and communities.
I would never say that politics isn’t important. It absolutely is, and we here at Harvard are especially charged with responsible stewardship of the leadership roles that many of us will have. But as I walk through the Yard in the crisp spring night, or watch the sun set over the Charles, or laugh with my teammates and comrades over a surprisingly good dining hall meal, I can’t help but feel that there are so many things that matter more than politics.
I am willing to bet that even the most politically active and vocal students at Harvard have found some of their greatest joys and happiness in something other than political engagement. Even at the activism-obsessed liberal bastion I and others affectionately refer to as “The Kremlin on the Charles,” I find that most people don’t let their activism or ideologies interfere with personal interactions with others. Most of us treat “The People” very differently than we treat “the people” in our lives. We seem to believe the personal is the political, but these two realms rarely align neatly.
Sure, that white cisgender straight male holding the door for you might be a sexist chauvinist promoting patriarchal oppression, but you smile and thank Ricky from your Organic Chemistry lab holding the door for you in the rain as you close your umbrella. Sure, that crazy hippie liberal with the Bernie Sanders stickers and Birkenstocks might be a socialist intent on the systematic dismantling of American enterprise, but you cheer and embrace your teammate Julie after systematically dismantling Yale’s unfortunate soccer team.
Our political callings, ideologies, and platforms are meaningless if we don’t, ultimately, treat people well. While this latter concept seems to have numerous and varied interpretations, when we leave the safety of groupthink and echo chambers, we encounter real people in real day-to-day situations, and we ought to treat each other with a standard of decency befitting the miracle that is a human being. Hopefully not news to anyone!
Politics won’t make us any wiser, nor any happier. There are representatives and individuals I respect who truly see their participation in our political system as humble civil service to their community and country. Most politicians, however, do not feel this way. We are fools to believe there is personal peace and fulfillment navigating the long hallways of bureaucracy, and I really do hope “career” politicians have some light in their lives that makes them want to get up every morning. The rhetoric and tropes of politics must surely lose their luster fairly quickly.
By the world’s standards, what I read, what I study, what I write, and what I experience might one day make me wise. But if I haven’t treated people around me well, if I haven’t seen through their politics to their humanity, if I haven’t loved my fellow man truly and deeply, I will be nothing. The purported wisdom of this world is utter foolishness to God, and I may forever be nothing but a wise fool. You know what? That’s okay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Laura, llama a tu papá que se fue desde ayer y no ha vuelto.”
The words stopped my heart as I sat in the silent Law School Library reading room. I had not been able to answer my phone, so my mom sent me the frantic text because she didn’t know where my dad was. I immediately responded, trying to get more information. I couldn’t get back to my work. Millions of thoughts were racing through my mind—one big one in particular.
It was Nov. 6th—two days before the election.
I left my stuff and rushed to the bathroom to call my dad. My fear built up for 15 minutes before it was released in the form of tears the second I heard his voice. He hadn’t been able to answer the phone because he was at a driving lesson. I kept myself composed so he wouldn’t know how worried I had been.
15 minutes. It felt like hours. It was a worry that had been building in the back of my mind for 15 years.
***
When I was little and my parents would leave for work, I was always scared, for reasons I didn’t know, that they wouldn’t return. My mom would babysit at night and I worried she wouldn’t be there when I woke up. I worried she’d never be able to tuck me in again. Fear was present before I even knew what deportation meant—before I knew what it meant to not have papers.
“No le digan a nadie que uno no sabe quien és de confianza.”
“Don’t tell anyone.” Our status had to remain a secret. Our home lives had to remain a secret. I couldn’t open up my home to all my friends. I couldn’t risk having the subject brought up casually over dinner. My siblings and I learned how to keep the secret before we knew what it even meant.
My parents taught my siblings and me how to be afraid to ensure our safety—this way we’d never be separated. They taught us to keep our immigration status a secret so that we could continue pursuing our dreams even though they didn’t have the same opportunity to pursue their own.
***
“Aquí guardamos el dinero y los papeles. Por si algo nos pasa.”
“In case something happens to us.” I was ten years old, but I knew what she meant. My mom pulled out the emergency money she had hidden in her drawer. She filed through the papers she kept in the closet. I didn’t think much of it at the moment. It wasn’t until years later when I brought it up in a group of friends that I realized they had never experienced anything like that.
Something so simple set us apart so much. A simple experience epitomized the difference that one piece of paper could mean in someone’s entire life.
***
My siblings recently visited me at Harvard. While walking through the Yard, I checked my bank account balance on my phone. My sister noticed I had a decent amount of money saved up.
“I have a few thousand. But that’s just because Albita transferred some of her money into my account,” she joked.
It took me a few seconds to realize the weight that her words carried. Fear manifests itself in the most unexpected places. The lovely day with my brother and sister was interrupted by the reality that we knew too well. My mom had transferred her money into my sister’s account in case anything happened to her and she wasn’t able to access it. She wanted to make sure we’d be fine. That has always been her first priority.
Walking through the Yard only reminded us that nothing can save us from this fear. Going to college does not change the fact that our futures are in the hands of a few people who don’t understand the ever-present state of anxiety we live in. Being at Harvard doesn’t change the fact that I fear for my safety and that of my family every day.

When the fake detainment notices were slipped under dorm room doors just a few weeks ago, there were students who fully believed what was written on them. They believed that either they or someone they loved was being detained. There was no reason not to believe it. Relief hit them when they flipped the paper and saw that they were fake.

UPDATED: May 4, 2017 at 11:20 a.m.
On June 23, 2016, Amanda N. Phillips '10—a 27-year-old Cambridge resident  and nursing student—was struck by the door of a Jeep and killed by a passing truck while biking in Inman Square. Four months later, Bernard “Joe” Lavins, a 60-year-old researcher, collided with a tractor trailer and died in a bicycle accident less than two miles away in Porter Square.
To some Cantabrigians, the two fatal crashes illustrated tragic shortcomings in the bicycle infrastructure of a city often heralded as one of the most bike-friendly in the country. With many cyclists come congested streets and, some residents say, an unsafe and accident-prone environment.
Cambridge has not sat idly by on bike safety: Both Phillips and Lavins died as Cambridge was years into a citywide plan to create a network of safer bike arteries and prevent fatal incidents in the future.
While Cambridge’s existing plans to promote safe ridership around the city have a clear and concrete vision and set of goals, to some residents, the implementation of bike safety measures has been largely ineffective. Citing accidents in the past, residents characterize these reforms as too small in scope to seriously improve the safety of Cambridge’s many cyclists.
Residents concerned about bike safety in Cambridge stress the need for fast, widespread reform. For local government officials working on these efforts, however, tangible change takes time.
Setting a Vision
In October 2015, local government officials released Cambridge’s Bicycle Plan, which aims to make “all streets bicycle friendly” and sets targets for increased bike ridership—by 2030, it reads, 20 percent of all trips in Cambridge will be made by bicycle. Coupled with Cambridge’s Five Year Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan, which allocates funds to reconstruct streets and sidewalks needing renovation, the Bicycle Plan broadly looks to improve the way cars, bicycles, and pedestrians share the road.
In March 2016, moreover, the City Council unanimously committed to “Vision Zero,” formally setting a goal of eliminating all serious bicycle collisions in Cambridge.
This commitment to safety has been a major consideration in Cambridge’s charge to redesign existing bike lanes. Although easy to enact in cities like Cambridge, painted bike lanes do little to mitigate dangers that cyclists face. According to research from the Harvard School of Public Health, traditional bike lanes force bikers to ride in close proximity to parked cars, which increases the risk of injury or death.
“On the road side of parallel parked cars, you run the risk of being doored or being killed,” said Anne Lusk, who conducted research on the lanes. “It’s a double Russian Roulette because a door opens, and you run into it or you swerve around it. And oncoming traffic could kill you.”
Cambridge is currently working to install protected bike lanes, an alternative to painted lanes with flexible posts marking a buffer zone between the bike lane and the street. In addition to alerting drivers to stay out of the buffer zone, the posts also prevent vehicles from using the bike lane to double park or drop off passengers.
So far, Cambridge has implemented two demonstrations testing the installation process and overall effectiveness of the new bike lanes. Both testing zones are one-block corridors on Massachusetts Avenue, with one between Sidney and Douglass Streets in Central Square, and the other near the Law School between Waterhouse and Everett Streets. They were installed in late 2016.
While the new lanes only cover about two blocks of city streets, the Bicycle Plan looks to have a comprehensive network of safe lanes in the future.
Doubts and Debates
While the protected bike lanes may seem like a step in the right direction, some Cantabrigians say the drawbacks of the lanes have outweighed their benefits.
For one, some residents criticized a loss of automobile parking space that came with the new lanes. Because the protected lanes need space for a buffer between cyclists and drivers, the city removed some previous parking spaces along one-block stretch of lanes.
Herb Taylor, a reverend at the Harvard-Epworth United Methodist Church—located along the new bike lanes on Mass. Ave—said parking space removal has been detrimental to the those that frequently visit the church. Taylor said that in addition to his own parishioners, three other religious groups, as well as multiple Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous groups, use the church as a meeting space.
“It just appeared one day, and it was a surprise,” Taylor said of the new bike lane. “Parking has always been a challenge, and closing off those spots... increased the challenge significantly on Sunday mornings.”
Taylor also said the protected lanes completely removed a handicapped parking spot on the street.
Susanne Rasmussen, who directs transportation initiatives across Cambridge, said that losing parking spaces to bike lanes is a legitimate concern. However, she said, in previous street redesigns, Cambridge has been able to repurpose existing parking space to alleviate the strain on residents with cars.
In the past, new parking spaces have been freed up moving fire hydrants to street corners, limiting parking to residents in the evening, and adding metered parking during the day.
“Using underutilized spaces on one side of the street plus underutilized spaces on adjacent streets, we were very much able to accommodate the parking demand,” Rasmussen said.
The Path Ahead
On the other side of the bike lanes debate, though, some residents have urged the city to implement protected paths on a larger scale, so that cyclists do not have to travel on roads without protected bike lanes to reach existing ones.
Nathanael Fillmore, who co-founded Cambridge Bicycle Safety—an advocacy group that formed shortly after Phillips’s death—said he believes the disconnectedness of the protected lanes poses a serious problem.
“So far, the city has been putting in a lot of disconnected cycle lanes and we really think it’s important to have a connected network,” Fillmore said.
Joseph E. Barr—Cambridge’s director of traffic, parking, and transportation—acknowledged these concerns, but said that the city’s pilot program looked to simply learn about better bike lane practices before implementing them on a larger scale.
“We sort of acknowledged up front that these weren’t creating a new network; these were just showing the possibilities and you know, giving people a taste of how this could work,” Barr said. “It may take a while before people really start to see the network connect exactly the way they want it to."
Following outcry from Cantabrigians like Fillmore, the municipal government plans to work to address residents’ concerns and install a large network of protected bike lanes.
Over the next year, for example, Cambridge will install a longer corridor of protected bike lanes on Cambridge Street. Two other segments will also be added on Mass. Ave. this spring.
The installation of the Cambridge Street lane, the first installation of protected lanes that will stretch for longer than one block, will give city planners a better sense of how quickly they will be able to install future corridors.
“Assuming all goes well with [the Cambridge Street installation], which at this point we’re getting pretty good feedback on it, then we can start to implement two or three of this type of corridor per year,” Barr said.
He added: “As much as we’re trying to move these things forward quickly, it won’t happen overnight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dozens of Harvard affiliates rallied on the steps of Widener Library Monday to advocate for workers and immigrants’ rights and supplement a larger Boston-wide May Day rally in Boston Common.
International Workers’ Day, celebrated yearly on May 1, draws thousands across the country to celebrate laborers and the working class. This year, the Harvard rally—called “Workers and Students United for Sanctuary” focused not only on workers’ rights, but also rights for undocumented immigrants.
Representatives from Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers and UNITE HERE Local 26—a Boston-based union representing Harvard’s dining hall workers—attended the event, along with several undergraduate organizations. Harvard Medical School professors and Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen also spoke at the rally.
At the demonstration, protesters spoke out against the federal government's crackdown on undocumented immigration and University President Drew G. Faust’s decision not to designate Harvard a “sanctuary campus.” In December, Faust said that the term has no clear legal meaning and could offer “false and misleading assurance” for undocumented students on campus.
A number of immigration policies enacted by President Donald Trump’s administration have drawn criticism from across the University. Earlier this year, at least four Harvard affiliates were barred from entering the United States after one of Trump’s executive orders suspended immigration from several majority-Muslim countries. Faust wrote a Harvard-wide email condemning the order shortly after it was issued, and signed a letter defending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—which provides young undocumented immigrants with some government protections—in November.
Daishi M. Tanaka ’19—who leads the immigrant advocacy group Act on a Dream—shared his story as an undocumented student and said his undocumented parents from Japan and the Philippines felt “external and internal stress” as a result of some of Trump’s campaign rhetoric. With Tanaka’s summer savings for airplane tickets, he said, both of his parents left the United States last year after 13 years in the United States.
Tanaka, one of roughly 40 undergraduates protected by DACA, said that he was “disappointed” by Faust’s decision to not dub Harvard a sanctuary campus and urged the University to reconsider.
“A sanctuary campus means that Harvard will stand by the immigrants that have sweat, bled, and cried to call this country home,” he said. “A sanctuary campus means that [Harvard] will lead the charge for this greater national movement. It means that Harvard will use its influence and privilege to do what it right.”
Last year, Faust, in an email to Harvard affiliates, wrote in a message that the Harvard University Police Department will not ask about the immigration status of Harvard affiliates or enforce federal immigration laws.
Mazen urged the crowd to establish a network of community organizers to further activism towards immigrants’ and workers’ rights.
“I hope you will find those in your network who are altruists, who are excited by the work of community organizing, and who are looking forward to the next phase of organizing in your community,” he said.
Medical School lecturer Phillip L. Rice implored demonstrators to stand against the Trump administration.
“We’re going to say no, we’re not going to accommodate, we’re not going to conciliate, and we’re not going to collaborate with this regime,” Rice said. “What needs to happen is that we need to drive it out.”

Former Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper and former U.S. Representative Michael J. Rogers explored Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday.
Kennedy School professor Graham T. Allison ’62—who moderated the event—paused after the two speakers were introduced to pull out a copy of the Boston Globe and display for the audience an April 2017 editorial titled “Keep your eyes on Russia” detailing allegations that the Russian government had tampered with last year’s presidential election.
“What do we know about ‘Russiagate’?” Allison asked the speakers.
Both Clapper and Rogers agreed that Russia aimed to undermine American democratic institutions this past election.
Clapper said that according to the information he had, he believed Russia had been initially interested in “sowing doubt” in American democracy, but became increasingly interested in supporting President Donald Trump against former Secretary of State and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as the election went on.
“In my view, the evidence for it was overwhelming,” he said.
Clapper described what he saw as “irrefutable” proof that Russia had meddled in the election through cyberattacks, hacking, and propaganda dispersed throughout social and traditional media.
Rogers, who used to chair the House Intelligence Committee,  said he was more concerned with the fact that such tampering came as a surprise to many Americans. He described how in past years has Russia attempted to influence other countries’ elections, and said the country is only pursuing the same strategy with more modern technologies now.
“Why we should be surprised is shocking to me,” Rogers said, “Both political parties are fighting about whose side [the Russians] were on—I think we should take away that…this was a very public display about trying to influence average Americans going about their day.”
Clapper made clear that while the FBI was certain that Russia attempted to plant doubts about the American electoral process, the effect of the tampering on the outcome of the election was less clear.
“What it did not do was determine whether or not the Russian influence actually had any impact on the results of the election,” he said.
Rogers warned audience members to be aware of the unconscious influence media can have on opinions and voting patterns.
“I think we all should understand that people are going to try to do that to you the next time you walk into the voting booth. You ought to understand that someone out there—today it’s the Russians, who knows—is trying to make some kind of an influenced statement on this,” Rogers said

With federal research budgets in jeopardy under President Donald Trump’s administration, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 assured the Faculty of Arts and Sciences that Harvard administrators are talking with legislators to prevent proposed cuts from passing.
At the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday, Garber said that branches of the University—including Harvard Public Affairs and Communications, its public relations and lobbying arm—are working to ensure that Harvard will not suffer from major cuts.
"Public affairs is deeply involved with various academic organizations trying to make sure our voice is heard,” Garber said. “Rest assured that we will be devoting considerable time and effort to do our part to ensure that the [fiscal year 2018] budget will not reflect all of the proposed cuts coming from the administration."
Trump has proposed significant reductions to the National Institutes of Health and suggested completely eliminating funding for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. Since November’s election, University President Drew G. Faust has made multiple trips to Washington, D.C. to speak to legislators, including Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, to defend federal research funding.
"Key people in Congress have clearly expressed resistance to some of the ideas about budget cuts the administration has put forward,” Garber said.
Faust was not at Tuesday’s meeting and instead attended the funeral of major Harvard donor David Rockefeller ’36, according to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, who chaired the meeting in Faust’s stead.
Also at the meeting, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris withdrew his April motion requesting the Faculty create a committee to implement a new course requirement called “Thinking with Data.” The proposed requirement—which would expose undergraduates to the principles of data analysis—was met with widespread resistance from the Mathematics department at last month’s Faculty meeting, with many suggesting it may oversimplify material taught in math courses.
The Faculty also approved a number of changes to the College’s student handbook. Among the changes was a clarification on the College’s marijuana policy in light of recent state-wide recreational legalization: The drug, while legal in Massachusetts, is federally illegal and therefore will remain prohibited on Harvard’s campus.
Harris also presented five-year reviews of the Mechanical Engineering and Electrical Engineering concentrations, as well as the current procedure for awarding degrees summa cum laude. FAS traditionally examines new programs five years after their inception.
Without any questions or comments, members of the Faculty also voted to approve the FAS and Extension School courses of study for the 2017-2018 year.

About 20 Social Studies concentrators met with members of a committee tasked with reviewing a College policy set to penalize membership in final clubs and Greek organizations in a town hall event on Tuesday.
The off-record conversation—facilitated by former Undergraduate Council Vice President Danny V. Banks ’17 and Shubhankar Chhokra ’18, an inactive Crimson editorial editor—attracted roughly 20 students to William James Hall. A Crimson reporter was asked to leave the event at its beginning.
History professor and chair of Social Studies James T. Kloppenberg, as well as Social Studies concentrators Banks and Chhokra, all sit on a committee that could revise or replace the College’s penalties for members of single-gender social groups.
“The committee has been asked to gather perspectives from students, and they would like to hear from you,” Anya B. Bassett, a senior lecturer on Social Studies, wrote in an emailed invitation to concentrators on April 26.
Bassett stressed in another email that the focus of the discussion was solely on student feedback regarding the sanctions.
“Jim Kloppenberg… and I will be there, but only to listen,” Bassett wrote.
Starting with the Class of 2021, the College’s policy will bar members of single-gender social groups from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, becoming varsity captains, or receiving College endorsement for a number of prestigious fellowships.
The sanctions—which Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and other College administrators spent a year crafting behind closed doors before unveiling in May 2016—was met with intense criticism, including a push among some professors to overturn it through Faculty legislation.
In light of faculty opposition, Khurana called for the formation of the faculty committee, which is tasked with assessing “whether the policy can be improved, either by changing aspects of its existing structure or through some broader revision.” Khurana currently co-chairs the committee, which is expected to produce recommendations for Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith in fall 2017.

The Cambridge Police Department’s Criminal Investigations Unit is “following up” on the injuries a 21-year-old woman suffered on Linden St. Saturday, according to CPD spokesperson Jeremy Warnick.
The Harvard University Police Department is also investigating a report of assault in a South Street parking lot near Kirkland House, though it is unconfirmed whether any Harvard affiliates were involved.
On Saturday, CPD and HUPD responded to the medical situation on Linden St. Several CPD vehicles were parked outside the Delphic Club, and officers were questioning undergraduate members of the club early Saturday evening.
“There was a medical situation on Saturday at approximately 5:37 p.m. on Linden Street near Massachusetts Avenue involving a 21-year-old female who suffered a laceration to her head,” Warnick wrote in a statement. “It appears that a bottle was thrown at a wall and subsequently shattered and struck a nearby female.”
HUPD has identified the individuals allegedly involved, according to Warnick.
“The CPD Criminal Investigations Unit will be following up to see if any possible criminal charges are to be applied and/or if the university should address this matter administratively,” he wrote.
Steven G. Catalano, a spokesperson for HUPD, declined to comment on the incident at the Delphic. He also did not comment on the assault on South St.
John R. S. Jacobsson ’90, the Delphic’s graduate board president, and several undergraduate members of the Delphic did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story.
Though the Delphic has a members-only policy, undergraduate members occasionally invite non-members into the club house.
On Monday, HUPD assisted CPD to respond to a report of “cans and bottles being thrown from the Delphic Club,” according to the HUPD police log.
With the end of classes, HUPD also responded to a number of noise complaints around campus this weekend.
Police also responded to reports of theft from Harvard housing. On Saturday, a cell phone valued at $180 was reportedly stolen from the Inn at Harvard and two laptops valued at $2300 were reportedly stolen from two rooms in Cabot House. Earlier this semester, a string of similar thefts occurred in Lowell House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School’s Junior Deferral Program will expand to accept applications from undergraduate juniors at colleges and universities nationwide in the fall of 2017, the Law School announced Wednesday.
The program, previously only open to Harvard College students since its inception in 2014, allows students to apply to the Law School during their junior year of college on the condition that they defer enrollment for at least two years if accepted. Students who are rejected from the JDP program may speak with a Law School admissions officer about their application.
Jessica L. Soban ’02, the Law School’s chief admissions officer, said she felt the program had been sufficiently tested and was suited to expand.
“We have been talking for the past several years about this being a pilot and collecting information from students who move through the program to understand what success it has really had for them,” Soban said. “This is the point where we feel like we have moved through an entire cycle with one cohort of participants in the program.”
Over the past few years, the Law School has taken a number of steps to change its admissions processes in order to make it easier to apply to the Law School, Soban said. After the 2008 recession, the number of applicants to the Law School decreased significantly, though in 2016 and 2017 the number of applicants increased 5 percent each year.
The Law School’s new admissions efforts include offering Skype interviews, eliminating seat deposits, instituting the JDP program, and, most recently, announcing that it will begin to accept the GRE in place of the LSAT starting in the fall of 2017. Soban also wrote in a press release that these changes are intended to attract students who studied science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow wrote in a press release that the program allows students to pursue professional opportunities after graduation without worrying about how prestigious they will appear on an application to the Law School.
“By offering admission to the most promising college juniors, we can encourage them to pursue important and fulfilling experiences without concerns about effects on a later application to law school,” Minow wrote.
Soban declined to provide admissions statistics for the JDP program so far, saying that the sample sizes were too small. Soban also said it will take a few years until specific admissions data will be available about the expanded JDP program, even once it has started accepting students.
“Small data sets, unrepresentative data sets, that can of course lead to decision-making on behalf of future candidates that would not be reflective of their actual likelihood of success in the program,” Soban said. “As we take this out to a national level...that is a minimum of three years away starting next year, there will be some time before we will know anything about this cohort having moved through.”
In order to educate students and academic advisers about the program, the Law School plans to host a series of online sessions for pre-law advisors and applicants at other colleges and universities, Soban said.
“We will be engaging in active outreach both to the pre-law advisors and to college campuses, not just in the U.S. but in universities around the world, to explain how to think about this program and how to decide whether this is right for you as an applicant,” Soban said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is expected to renovate Adams House as the sixth installment in the more than $1 billion project to modernize and renovate the College’s upperclassmen Houses.
Adams House Faculty Deans Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 announced the planned renovation in an email Wednesday morning to Adams residents.
“We see this as a great opportunity to bring the infrastructure of Adams House into the 21st century,” the Palfreys wrote. “The House will be able to support student life in ways that our current spaces simply cannot.”
Renovations will likely include facilities such as “refurbished residential suites, additional social spaces,” and “music practice and performance venues,” the Palfreys wrote. Beginning as early as fall 2017, students, staff, and alumni will have the opportunity to give feedback on potential designs, according to the email.
Facing a struggling endowment and lukewarm support from donors, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has incurred debt to pay for the expensive project. Building additional student social spaces in the Houses has been a common feature of the FAS House Renewal project as College administrators push to re-center social life in the Houses.
Although the Palfreys did not discuss a specific timeline on Wednesday, the email indicated that renovations will not begin until after the completion of Lowell House in fall 2019.
Winthrop House is currently under construction and will reopen in August with the expansion of a new wing. Renovations on Lowell House will begin in the summer and last for two years—the first House renewal project to span multiple academic years.
Smaller-scale renovations of Quincy House’s Stone Hall and Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall were the first two installments in the House renewal project. Dunster was the first House to be entirely renovated, and a fully-renewed Winthrop House will reopen in fall 2017.
Adams House—one of the original seven Houses—is composed of separate residential buildings that were built during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Though the buildings of Adams House were acquired by Harvard in the early 20th century to establish the House system, Apthorp House, the residence of the Faculty Deans, was constructed in 1760 and is the oldest part of Adams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 3, 2017 at 2:21 p.m.
More than 60 students enrolled in Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” last semester appeared before the College’s Honor Council in a wave of academic dishonesty cases that has stretched the Council to its limits over the past few months, according to two people with direct knowledge of the investigations.
The spate of cases represents roughly ten percent of the 636 total fall enrollees in Harvard’s flagship introductory computer science course. While students from CS50 have often appeared before the Honor Council, last semester represented a marked increase in cases, according to the two individuals.
CS50 head instructor David J. Malan ’99, who has led the course through an enormous expansion in size and popularity over the last decade, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
Last academic year, the Honor Council heard 115 total academic dishonesty cases, with a majority stemming from courses in the Sciences Division or the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The bevy of academic dishonesty cases in CS50 placed a heavy burden on the Honor Council, a body of roughly 30 students, faculty, and administrators that enforces Harvard’s Honor Code, according to the two individuals.
The College rolled out the Honor Code, a policy that outlines Harvard’s standards for academic integrity, after a cheating scandal in a government course swept the College in 2012. At the time, one administrator called the pattern of cheating “unprecedented in anyone’s living memory,” and more than 120 students enrolled in Government 1310: “Introduction to Congress” eventually underwent investigation for academic dishonesty.
Brett Flehinger, Honor Council secretary and associate dean for academic integrity and student conduct, said in an interview Tuesday that the Honor Council will be increasing the number of non-voting undergraduates next year.
He said he hopes the new members take on a more public role and declined to comment on whether the expansion in size is partly due to the heavy caseload from CS50.  He also declined to comment on the CS50 cases.
“We don’t comment on individual cases, we don’t comment on individual courses,” Flehinger said. “If you’re an individual student going through this, the minute that a course is named or anything about that course comes out in The Crimson, you think they’re talking about you.”
“What goes from being a confidential process now becomes something that you feel like is being played out in public, so we just don’t talk about it—we won’t,” Flehinger added.
The Honor Council can recommend that students guilty of academic integrity violations undergo a “change in status” ranging from probation to temporary withdrawal from the College, and even permanent dismissal in extreme cases.
Malan reviewed potential academic dishonesty cases near the close of the semester, according to the two individuals. As a result, Malan delivered many CS50 cases to the Honor Council in one batch late in the semester.
Malan met with Honor Council members to discuss academic integrity within the class, the two people said. The CS50 website asserts that the course’s “philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as ‘be reasonable.’”
“The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material, [but] there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another,” the site reads. “The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own.”
The website goes on to list acts of collaboration that are “reasonable”—like sharing a few lines of code—and “not reasonable,” like soliciting solutions to homework problems online. In 2014, CS50 introduced a “regret clause,” allowing students who commit “unreasonable” acts to face only course-specific penalties if they report the violation within 72 hours.
Students who report violations within that time frame may receive an “unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts,” according to the CS50 website.
The course—marketed towards students with no background in computer science—features work-intensive problem sets. This year, Malan introduced several changes to CS50, assigning  “trimmer” problem sets and relaxing lecture attendance policies.
After the changes, the proportion of students who reported spending more than 14 hours a week on the class in course evaluations dropped from 63 percent in 2015 to 40 percent in 2016. Course-specific advice and, in some cases, code for CS50 problem sets are available online.
Though popular, the course has drawn criticism for its corporate sponsorships. The course was also the subject of an apparent trademark dispute between Malan and Harvard. Over the past few years, Malan and the University each filed contradictory applications to trademark the course. At one point in 2011, Malan formed a now-dissolved “education consulting” business dubbed “CS50 LLC.”
Asked several times whether he found it concerning that information about confidential Honor Council cases had become public, Flehinger did not respond directly Tuesday.
“You guys, it’s your job,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team took on its northern Ivy foes in the final weekend of play, splitting a pair of doubleheaders in a home-and-home against Dartmouth.
In both of the twinbills, the Crimson(19-23, 7-13 Ivy League) took close victories in the second game while struggling offensively in the earlier games against the Big Green (22-17-1, 11-9 Ivy League). The final score of all four games was decided by less than three runs between two evenly matched opponents.
“We got some really good momentum for this young club moving forward,” coach Bill Decker said. “I am really happened for everyone. We talked a lot this year of just staying competitive and having a lot of options with many guys coming back.”
DARTMOUTH 2, HARVARD 1
In a pitcher’s duel at Red Rolfe Field in Hanover, N.H., Dartmouth edged Harvard narrowly after a strong performance by senior righthander Chris Burkholder. Although both pitchers managed to go sixth innings in the seven-inning series opener, the Big Green won the tight battle off two solo home runs by junior outfielder Kyle Holbrook and freshman first baseman Michael Calamari.
The Crimson was limited to three hits in the game. Unable to carry any momentum until the last inning, Harvard managed to stay within striking distance through an impressive pitching performance by junior righthander Ian Miller, who delivered six innings for the Crimson.
The lone run for Harvard came in the seventh, when junior pinch hitter Austin Black scored sophomore first baseman Patrick McColl off a sacrifice fly. McColl started the inning with a double to center field, but he was the only runner to score, as the Crimson left two on base to finish the game.
Regardless, a strong effort to finish the game gave positive momentum. In particular, Black reinforced his role as the team’s unofficial designated pinch-hitter by delivering another RBI in crunch time.
“His role is exactly that, as someone who can come in and give us a victory.” Decker said. “He knows his role, and it is a very easy decision to bring him in. He had some really good at bats for us on Saturday.”
HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 6
Scoring six runs in the eighth inning, Harvard edged out Dartmouth in the second game of Saturday’s matchup. Freshman second baseman Quinn Hoffman was the offensive leader for the game, landing two hits and two RBIs off five at-bats.
In the critical eighth inning, Hoffman delivered the second run of the shift by singling to left and scoring freshman right fielder Jake Suddleson, who had previously tripled.
The final of the inning’s six runs was again off the bat of pinch hitter Austin Black, who sent a routine pop fly into center that was dropped. This error scored two runs in the process, the second of which gave the Crimson the lead heading into the final two innings.
Assigned as the late-season closer, freshman reliever Kieran Shaw shut out the Big Green in the final two innings and captured his third save of the season.
DARTMOUTH 3, HARVARD 0
Coming into O’Donnell Field on Sunday, the Crimson struggled mightily to get on base as the team finished with just two runners in seven innings. This was nearly a repeat performance from Saturday’s earlier game, when the hosts put up one run
Defensively, the only bump for Harvard came in the top of the second inning, in which the team gave up all of the Big Green’s three runs. Dartmouth sophomore shortshop Nate Ostmo tripled off Harvard sophomore right-hander Simon Rosenblum-Larson, before then stealing home off an attempted pickoff by Ellis at second.
Rosenblum-Larson delivered an otherwise solid performance, going all seven innings while fanning six batters. He finished the season with three wins in nine starts and an earned run average of 4.42.
The only noteworthy offensive play for the Crimson came off a double from sophomore designated hitter Patrick Robinson, who finished the season with a team-leading batting average of .373 with 34 RBIs and nine home-runs.
HARVARD 8, DARTMOUTH 7
In a back-and-forth final game, Harvard took home the win in dramatic fashion off another final inning RBI by pinch-hitter Black.
Up one run heading into the top of the ninth, Shaw was unable to lock up the victory for the Crimson. Down to the last out, Dartmouth freshman outfielder Trevor Johnson delivered a two-run bomber to center-field.
Unfazed, the Crimson responded in the bottom of the ninth, getting runners on first and second with one out. Having taken out starting third baseman Jake Forte for defensive purposes, Coach Decker brought in pinch-hitter Black to prolong the inning.
“I was just looking for a good fastball to hit,” Black said. “I just had to battle through his pitches and get a good ball to hit to get my guys around.”
Black pulled through for Harvard with a single down the right field line. After a fortuitous fielding error by rightfielder Kyle Holbrook, baserunners McColl and Hoffman both reached home and capped off the victory for the Crimson.
“You can’t paint a better picture than that,” co-captain Josh Ellis said. “It was unbelievable. Black definitely hasn’t had the most conventional career here, being plagued with sickness and injury, but he picked us up big time this weekend. What a way to go out.”
