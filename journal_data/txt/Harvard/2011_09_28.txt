After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not all protests are equal. Some fall within the grounds of legitimate demonstration and freedom of speech, and some violate other people’s rights. The issue of protests at universities and other arenas involving students and young people has understandably always been a sensitive subject, particularly after the outrages of police and military suppression of Vietnam War-era demonstrations. Since then, however, lawmakers and broad sections of the public have agreed that a protest which itself involves suppressing another person’s right to freedom of speech—whether during a public event, speech, or debate—is wrong. That, at least, was the recent verdict by an Orange County jury concerning a protest by a Muslim student group during a speech in February 2010 by Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, at the University of California Irvine’s Law School.
The jury ruled that students had conspired to disrupt Oren’s speech to the extent that he could no longer continue, and as a result their actions amounted to a criminal conspiracy. The judge proceeded to sentence the “Irvine 11” to three years of probation and 56 hours of community service. Throughout the trial and immediately after the verdict, supporters of the ten students convicted—including from representatives of the Council on American-Islamic relations—have accused the case of being politicized and a symbol of rising Islamophobia in America. In defending freedom of speech and rights to protest, it is of paramount importance not to single out or put the spotlight on specific communities or groups, particularly surrounding such a highly-charged issue like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Nevertheless this well-publicized case gets to the heart of how a potentially legitimate protest can go too far and infringe on the rights of other people.
Last week’s action by Harvard effectively to curtail a live protest against the return of NROTC on campus, and to organize an official NROTC protest at a later time, offers an example in the other direction of how authorities can go too far in clamping down on student protests. As members of a vibrant campus community where so much potential for frank dialogue exists, no one should be in the business of suppressing open and free expression or conversation. Just as Harvard’s administration should not have tried to restrict the vigorousness of protest on our campus, students at Irvine should not be in the business of preventing a visitor from making his case.
This goes to the heart of why this particular protest was misguided. Indeed, many of those present might very well have agreed with a coherent expression of their opposition to Oren or Israel, but were instead treated to what the court decided was a periodic, loud disruption of the speech. Also disconcerting was the reaction of the defending protesters, who instead of taking responsibility for their actions and acknowledging that they had clearly committed a crime, instead chose to pass themselves off to the court and public as First Amendment martyrs.
This protest smacked of self-righteousness and was counterproductive, similar to how David H. Petraeus’ speech was drowned out by protesters during an appearance at Georgetown in January, 2010. In the end, the Irvine 11 only managed to get themselves ejected from the speech one by one, and in the end did not succeed in stopping Oren’s speech and did not manage to challenge his points in a legitimate debate. That would have been a more compelling mode of opposition. As it was, the protesters violated the rights of both the speaker and his audience, and, like others who perform similar acts, can only accept responsibility for their acts, especially when pre-meditated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s become customary in American politics to respond to a crisis with a set of big measures intended to never let it happen again. Sometimes these measures are overreactions. Sept. 11 was followed by enormous expansions of homeland security spending that’d never pass a basic cost-benefit analysis, given the rarity of terrorism. Include the trillions of dollars spent on the occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq—which were at least ostensibly launched in reaction to the attacks—and the reaction looks even more ludicrous in scale.
Other times, the reaction falls short. The Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation gave regulators a number of new tools, notably “resolution authority” that can be used to orderly dissolve banks, that could come in handy in the event of another financial crisis. But there is reason to doubt its ability to prevent such a crisis in the first place, especially given the amount of discretion it gives to regulators who fell down on the job in the run-up to the 2008 crisis. Indeed, some regulators are already opposing tough capital requirements on banks, one of the main mechanisms the law gives regulators to prevent another crisis.
But whatever one believes about the response to 9/11 and the financial crisis, they were at least cases where lawmakers recognized that something had gone wrong and needed fixing. The crisis we find ourselves in today—namely, the appallingly high rate of unemployment, and especially long-term unemployment—isn’t like that. To liberals and most economists, it is obvious that the political system has failed to act decisively to pass programs (low-income tax cuts, infrastructure spending, unemployment benefit extensions, etc.) that are needed to increase aggregate demand and drive the unemployment rate down.
But the Republicans running the House of Representatives don’t recognize this as a problem. One can debate the reasons for their complacency. The most straightforward explanation is that House Speaker John Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor are familiar with political science studies that indicate that the party controlling the presidency tends to do poorly when the economy does poorly, and thus understand it to be in their best interest to keep unemployment high. Indeed, some Republicans aides say they want to block Obama’s jobs bill not because it’s bad policy, but to deny him a “win.”
The GOP’s refusal to take the demand shortfall seriously is tragic on two levels. The first level is near-term. If unemployment is going to go down anytime soon, either the Federal Reserve has to get much more aggressive about monetary stimulus, or Congress has to pass another big fiscal stimulus package, such as the American Jobs Act proposed by the administration. With the Fed ruling out more asset buys in favor of less effective measures and the GOP blocking any fiscal stimulus, both options are basically off the table.
But the GOP’s demand denialism is also harmful for the precedent it sets. Boehner and Cantor are hardly going to be the last opposition leaders to realize that a growing economy is a “win” for the president. And in our political system, where even an opposition that is in the minority in both Houses can block legislation, that’s dangerous. We will have recessions in the future, and when we do, we can’t count on the president having 60 votes in the Senate and 218 in the House, such that it’s in the interest of everyone in power to help the economy recover. The deck is currently stacked against decisive action to aid recovery. It’s time to stack it in favor.
One way to do so would be to change Congressional procedures in general. The filibuster, for example, makes it unnecessarily difficult to pass any legislation, even when, as in 2009-10, the party in power has big majorities in both houses. But eliminating the filibuster, while an essential step, doesn’t help much in times of divided government. Another option without that problem would be to greatly expand the size of the government’s “automatic stabilizers”: that is, programs that automatically cut taxes or increase spending in times of recession. For example, former White House budget director Peter R. Orszag has proposed making the payroll tax rate a function of unemployment, so that it gets cut automatically when there’s a downturn, providing some automatic stimulus.
Bypassing Congress by making such measures automatic may seem anti-democratic. But it’s hard to care too much about procedural niceties when, as Yahoo! News has reported, families are resorting to cooking dandelions from their yards to keep from starving. Congress has demonstrated that it is incapable of being an effective steward of the economy. It’s time to stop trusting it to be one.

Vladimir Putin's announcement to run for a third presidential term in 2012 was met with considerable amounts of both fanfare and frustration among Russians. A stadium of eleven thousand supporters from his political party, United Russia, cheered on his decision on Saturday night, with many millions more at home applauding and an equal number gritting their teeth for the twelve years to come. Russians from both sides shared a common denominator, however--an absolute assurance as to who would be elected president come March.
Putin's decision to run for a third presidential term and, more importantly, the manner in which it was publicly accepted sets a dangerous precedent for Russian government and civil society. With Putin at the helm of Russian government, the next twelve years promise political indifference in place of political engagement. While Putin may appear a safer choice to many Russians, continued dependence upon a single authoritarian leader siphons power away from the people and creates a government with a dangerous lack of accountability.
One of the most important revelations that came with Saturday's announcement was the extent of Putin's influence. Dmitri Medvedev, the current president, was elected in 2008 with Putin's endorsement and served all four years in office amidst speculations of being a placeholder president designed to tide over the public until Putin's return. (While the Russian constitution prohibits more than two consecutive terms in office, it has no laws against intermittent terms.) On Saturday, Medvedev himself stated that the presidential candidate for 2012 was decided sometime in 2007--“back when we first formed a friendly alliance”-- proving cynics right in their assumptions.
At the present, it appears Putin will become president without any serious challengers. Even the most inoculate political parties and like-minded contenders are too great a challenge for Putin's United Russia to allow. The two parties that once showed potential in terms of opposition, A Just Russia and Right Cause, have weakened to the point of irrelevance. Mikhail Prokhorov, the former head of the Right Cause party and the only person outside of the United Russia system who was even half-seriously considered a contender for office, was recently ousted first from a presidential economiccommission and then from the leadership of Right Cause, which he himself later described as a “Kremlin puppet party”.
In contrast to Right Cause, A Just Russia, a socialist democrat party, has a showing in Duma and a longer history of frustrating the Kremlin, though just as little chance of making a serious dent in the election. In light of Putin's decision, A Just Russia party has once again vowed to “break the monopoly of a single party” and tackle problems like economic inequality and corruption. The party has undertaken similar goals in the past and met with sharp opposition and disappointing results. According to surveys by the Levada Center, popular support for the party currently rests at four percent, a figure unlikely to cause United Russia to lose sleep.
To be fair, if Putin reaches the four-term mark it will only partially be due to a lack of opposition. Putin remains popular in Russia, largely due to associations with the prospering economy and growing global power of Russia in the early 2000s and the sense of confidence he inspires. According to an independent poll conducted by the Levada Center in 2011, 55 percent of Russians believe that Putin can enact positive change in their lives and 70 percent trust him as a political leader. For a country now celebrating its 20th anniversary of living with uncertainty, the lure of stability--especially in the midst of an economic crisis-- is something few can afford to scorn.
The problem with Putin, however, is not the power he wields but the way in which he attains it. In that same poll conducted by the Levada Center, only 32 percent of Russians believed that the citizens would directly decide the results of the 2012 presidential election. Russia's failure to build an authentic democracy, complete with transparency and active political participation, continues the trend of clustering power in the hands of the governing elite. This imbalance of power leaves the Russian people without the means to hold their government accountable, worsening the already-existing problems of widespread corruption and limited press freedom.
In conclusion, though Putin as an individual enjoys the trust of the Russian people, there is no guarantee that the leader who follows his stead will be able to maintain the same level of trust and social stability. The leaders that contend for power in 2024 may promise to be more aggressive in their manipulations and lust for power. It is in that context that the Putin precedent becomes especially dangerous.
In the words of Vladimir Gelman, a professor at the European University of St. Petersburg, “what is good for the Kremlin is not equally good for Russia's future”. Without any experience in guiding their country's political direction, Russians cannot assure a future in their best interests or protect themselves from the ambitions of a tyrant. Should the Russians choose to use it, the learning opportunity that this election provides could be essential to ensuring the integration of democracy into their political system.  For Russia, it would indeed be wiser to choose the temporary instability of a tempestuous 2012 election season than the permanent instability of a government disconnected from its citizens.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama’s speech before the United Nations last Friday was nothing short of a nightmare for the many Americans who had been hoping that the moral authority this man had once commanded would emerge at this historic moment in the future of the Middle East.
For those supporters of Israel who, though increasingly shocked and dismayed at Israel’s ongoing military occupation of the Palestinian Territories are still passionate believers in the possibility of a “democratic, Jewish state,” the speech read like an obituary for the dream of a “liberal Zionism”. Obama’s lips were clear: the occupation is not ending any time soon, and we are in no hurry to pressure Israel to make peace. It was as if Benjamin Netanyahu himself had written the speech.
It should not have been a surprise, but it was. Since January, we have seen nation after Arab nation erupt in protests and demand an end to tyranny, and it seemed only natural that the Arab Spring would eventually reach Palestine as well. When Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas declared his intention to seek statehood for Palestine at the U.N., it seemed a step in the right direction for the nine million Palestinians who live scattered between the West Bank, Gaza, and the countless refugee camps of the neighboring countries.
Indeed, the step was part of a long history of nonviolent resistance to Israeli occupation and aggression that has been integral to the Palestinian struggle for many years. While many headlines in recent decades have focused on Palestinians militants, the reality is that both the 1st and 2nd Intifadas in the Occupied Palestinian Territories began as movements of peaceful civil resistance that sought to defeat a military occupation that had no intention of going away.
Since 2002, for example, weekly rallies have been held in East Jerusalem, Qalqilya, and other cities across Palestine to protest the restrictions on freedom of movement imposed by the Israeli occupation. These rallies, attended by Palestinians, Israelis, and many international observers, are regularly attacked by Israeli Defense Forces, who have wounded and even killed nonviolent protesters. “Armed only with their dreams, courage, hope and slogans in the face of bullets, tanks, tear gas and bulldozers,” as Palestinian President Abbas eloquently described them at his speech at the U.N., these protesters have redefined Palestinian resistance and brought worldwide attention to the realities of military occupation.
Unfortunately, the U.S. and Israel continue to ignore these demands. For years, the Palestinians have been brought to the negotiating table and told to make concessions. And for years, Israel has used these negotiations as a cover to hide their intolerant position. For example, in the period between 1993 and 2000 during which the Palestinians and the Israelis were involved in the “peace process” following the signing of the Oslo Accords, Israel nearly doubled the population of the Israeli settlements in the Palestinian West Bank, according to the Foundation for Middle East Peace. Why should the Palestinians return to any negotiations when history has shown Israel’s unwillingness to take them seriously?
Public opinion around the world, particularly in Europe and the United States, has slowly shifted against Israel in the last decade as they’ve witnessed how Israel manipulates negotiations and systematically abuses human rights. A recent survey of Conservative Jewish rabbis in America reported that 44 percent admitted to being “sometimes ashamed” of the Jewish State’s policies and 78 percent view the settler movement unfavorably. Even in Israel, a Hebrew University poll conducted two weeks ago revealed that nearly 70 percent of Israelis would accept the Palestinian state if it succeeded.
Essentially, in his speech President Obama revealed himself to be more pro-Israeli than even the Israelis themselves, and he made it clear to Palestinians that no matter how peaceful or how violent they choose to be in their struggle for freedom the United States will reject their cries.
Many Americans have long considered Israel a strong ally and have turned a blind eye to its military occupation, focusing instead on the nominally democratic and liberal Zionism that seemed to characterize Israel proper. Even though Israel was engaged in less-than-moral conduct in the Occupied Territories, they reasoned, with a little pressure they would come to their senses and recognize the right of Palestinians to freedom and security in their own state.
This stance is, as of last Friday, untenable. Our president is unwilling to put any pressure on Israel to conform to international standards of human rights in its treatment of the Palestinians, and the result is an immoral, illegal military occupation with no end in sight. With every day that passes it becomes clearer that Israel’s so-called “excesses” are actually its very nature, and its steady refusal to withdraw from the Occupied Territories or acknowledge the Palestinians’ right to exist is not going to change.
It is impossible for any serious progressive to claim that Israel wants peace and the U.S. will help it get there. President Obama’s speech at the General Assembly was, for all intents and purposes, a nail in the coffin for liberal Zionism.

Critics love to say that Harvard professors are distant, inaccessible, and too busy to care about their students. All you ex-addicts of College Confidential know what we’re talking about.
But luckily for the babies of 2015, the Freshman Dean’s Office has just released an official guide for “Getting to Know Faculty”—and FM can’t help but add our own.
INTERACTION WITH FACULTY AND STAFF
Don’t be intimidated by that half-Windsor knot and that perfectly stoic look. Confidence is key! Professors love playing hard to get, but the truth is that they’re actually afraid of rejection: ease their doubt by coming on hard.
So, yes, there are office hours, but why limit yourself to one setting? If you’re on campus and desperate, track them down for “toilet hours”—and always take the stall right next to theirs.
Suggested one-liner: “So, Professor ... do you come here often?”
FIRST-YEAR FACULTY DINNERS
Don’t pass up the chance to dine with one of Harvard’s finest. Invite the most famous professor you know to a faculty dinner, and relish the one-on-one time. Then, when your new best friend is pondering the theories of the universe, grab his used napkin with a ninja move. Steal anything else you can get your hands on, and sell it on eBay for an exorbitant amount.
Guilty pleasure: your secret shrine of items and photos dedicated to your favorite professor, which you can turn into a museum with an entrance fee.
LUNCHEON SERIES
Free food. Enough said.
Topic for discussion: the difference between a lunch and a luncheon.

1. Feel the Revolution: Over the past couple of weeks, hundreds have taken part in the “Occupy Wall Street” movement, demonstrating in lower Manhattan.  At least 80 were arrested at the march last Saturday.
2. Congress prepares for another showdown, this time regarding funding for disaster relief.
3. But the most depressing showdown of the month goes to Snooki and Jionni.  The scenes of Snooki bawling in the streets of Florence were … intense.
4. Future Wall Street applicants, take note.  A new study—undertaken by a former derivatives trader, no less—suggests that hormones drive investment decisions, leading to irrational decisions. In other words, under the influence of a surge of testosterone or cortisol, you might forget everything you learned in Ec 10.
5. On the other hand, those of you who placed Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 on your fantasy football rosters made a good bet.  Fitzpatrick has emerged as the star quarterback of the Buffalo Bills.
6. Insert motivational (but probably not so outrageous) platitude here: A story in last week’s New York Times asks, “What if the Secret to Success is Failure?”
7. The temperatures might still be in the 70s, but celebrate the coming of fall this Sunday with the 33rd Annual Harvard Square Oktoberfest & HONK! Festival Parade.
8. Harvard now has a new second-place prize to add to its mantelpiece. According to a recent survey, Harvard ranks just behind Notre Dame in social media use.
9. Here’s a story of a lovely lady: Florence Henderson, best known for playing the role of Carol Brady, tells all in her new memoir, “Life is Not a Stage.”  Embarrassing secrets abound (think crabs).
10. All in the name of sanitation—Did you know that San Francisco is proposing a law that would require nudists to place a protective barrier over bus seats, restaurant chairs, or public benches before perching?  More importantly, did you know that public nudity is allowed in San Francisco?

Who says that Harvard students don’t have sex? Here at FM, we know the problem isn’t so much our lack of game as it is bad advertising. In an effort to correct this delusion—and to spice up our collective sex lives—we urge VES students to start filming the following productions.
Annenberg After Hours
It’s nearly midnight, and the hungry freshmen of Harvard are looking for a place to satisfy their appetites. They push to the gates of the feasting hall, wondering what delights would be offered tonight. Pizza with extra sausage? Exotic German chocolate—or just plain vanilla? At Annenberg After Hours, you can have it your way.
Harvard University Campus Escort Service
After hitting the books hard all day, Mandy looks outside and sees that it’s already dark. “Perfect,” she purrs, putting away her copy of “Lolita.” She can finally take advantage of the “Evening Van Service” that she can jump on and ride all night. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a tall, strapping man in uniform approaching. “Finally,” she thinks, and haughtily tosses her lustrous hair. Mandy’s night is just beginning.
Orgasmic and Evolutionary Biology
The fiery Cinnamon Hartt just graduated with a degree in orgasmic and evolutionary biology—but in this economy, it’s tough to find a job. So Hartt is taking her bachelor’s to the street, where her classes in Anatomy and Animal Behavior prove more pleasurable than she imagined in her wildest dreams.

For the last few years, Associate Professor of Physics Markus Greiner has been hot stuff on the physics circuit.
“Every year, the American Physical Society holds a conference for Atomic Molecular Optical Physics.  When he speaks ... he fills the room, even at an 8 a.m. talk,” said M. Eric Tai, one of the graduate students working in the Greiner lab.
Despite his fame in the physics world, Greiner’s greatest appeal to students seems to come from his down-to-earth attitude. At the end of a class, he takes his undergraduates out to ice cream.  He also invites his graduate students to lunch on a regular basis. “He is so laid-back [that] you wouldn’t expect him to be so good,” said Tai.
Besides being approachable, he is also committed to sparking passion for learning. “My approach of teaching is as much hands on as possible, as much intuitive as possible, as much to foster creativity as possible ... so students can explore how exciting physics can be,” said Greiner.
His methods appear to be working. “I didn’t understand how to visualize what he was deriving for us, so Professor Greiner built a laser setup and brought it in to class,” said Vijay Jain ’11, a former student. “We learned directly from the table ... rather than long, drawn-out derivations.”
For Professor Greiner, the purpose of physics is not to get stressed out about grades or to find the perfect internship. Rather, it is about exploring unsolved mysteries and remaining curious about puzzles.
“Sometimes it is not just important to have straight A’s,” said Greiner. “It is sometimes important to be creative.”

When Matthew K. Nock, a professor of Psychology and Director for Clinical and Developmental Research in the Department of Psychology, told his wife that he had received the MacArthur “Genius” Grant, she didn’t believe him. “But luckily,” he said, “I got the letter the next day.”
Nock is one of three Harvard professors to win this year’s prestigious MacArthur Fellowship; he is the son of a mechanic and the first in his family to graduate from college. He owes his widespread recognition to his research into the prediction and prevention of suicidal and self-injurious behavior, but Nock’s committment to the learning of others has earned him two undergraduate teaching awards.
The mysterious MacArthur Foundation didn’t let Nock’s family know about the award in advance. He spoke to his father on the morning the award was announced. “He told me in no uncertain terms that I am not a genius,” said Nock. “And he’s still the person I’m going to call when my motorcycle doesn’t start.”
Nock has had his Harley-Davidson for almost 10 years. “My dad’s a mechanic and he has two Harleys,” Nock explained. “My brothers are both mechanical engineers and they have Harleys.”
For Nock, who comes off as far too humble to take the “genius” tag seriously, it’s the importance of his work that should take center stage. “It’s impossible to know why our research lab was acknowledged,” he said. “I think it has more to do with the problem we’re studying.”
According to Karina Hsieh ‘13, who took Nock’s Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences class last semester, the grant-winner’s dedication to living social issues pays off. “He makes dry material much more interesting,” Hsieh said. “He explained things in a way that it applied to the real world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Rockefeller University scientist, speaking at a discussion hosted by the Mind/Brain/Behavior Initiative Tuesday, said that anxiety may have more negative health effects than commonly expected.
The discussion with professor Bruce McEwen, head of the Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology, was titled “The Brain on Stress: How the Social Environment ‘Gets Under the Skin.’”
McEwen spoke at Harvard a day after receiving the Edward M. Skolnick Prize in Neuroscience from MIT, described by professor Jack P. Shonkoff, director of the Center on the Developing Child at Harvard, as one of the highest honors in the field.
McEwen said that the best treatments for severe stress may be found, not in medication, but through confidence-building, a well-balanced diet, and routine exercise.
So for the overworked, under-slept college student, he said, a healthy lifestyle includes good time management, prioritizing important tasks, and not becoming overwhelmed.
McEwen explained that stress is caused by a variety of medical and experiential factors.
Experimentation has shown, he said, that brain structures have a certain degree of “plasticity,” meaning that their size and conformations can be modified over time in response to environmental cues.
He said that stress can act as a cue, and “molds” the brain by changing the way it processes anxiety, mood, and memory.
While this can help elicit the appropriate immediate response from the body, chronic brain moldings due to stress, in the long-term, can damage memory, learning ability, and social behaviors.
He said chronic stress may limit the formation of new nerve cells and lead to shrinkage of the hippocampus, a brain region fundamental to forming memories.
The good news though, McEwen said, is that much of the stress-induced brain remodeling is reversible.
Routine exercise stimulates growth in the hippocampus, and exercising in groups also fosters neuron development.
McEwen’s presentation was particularly appropriate for the sleep-deprived college student.
Sleep deprivation, he said, is a major cause and result of physiologic stress.
Poor sleeping habits have also been shown to increase the levels of brain chemicals that impair sociability.
James Herman, a professor of psychology at the University of Cincinnati and director of the Stress Neurobiology Laboratory, said his research has also demonstrated the negative impact stress can have on late adolescence, at least among animals.
“The forefront [of research] now is that the brain keeps its plasticity up until adolescence,” he said.
“Our group has shown that in late-adolescence animals that are given chronic stress exposure show a much greater physiological response ... than during early adolescence or when the animals are adults,” Herman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew J. Magliozzi ’05, a Quincy House tutor, is looking to revolutionize the way students experience higher education through the expansion of his non-profit website FinalsClub.org, which allows students to share publicly class notes, outlines, and slides on the site.
This year, Magliozzi expanded the site’s client base, creating new branches at universities nationwide.
Finalsclub.org is open to the Ivies, Berkeley, Lock Haven, MIT, Stanford,  University of Texas, and Wellesley.
“I really want it to become a sustainable project at every college campus in the world,” Magliozzi explained. “We’re starting at a certain group of schools that have motivated students, and I have some connections at them. But we want to go everywhere.”
Magliozzi was inspired by the MIT Open Courseware project, which—like FinalsClub.org—is a free publication that gives the general public access to university course materials, including lecture videos.
Since its creation in 2003, the MIT Open Courseware project, which is run by the university, has grown to include nearly every MIT course and has garnered nearly 100 million visits.
While Magliozzi hopes to replicate this program’s success, his approach differs: finalsclub.org relies on the participation of students, not the administration.
Magliozzi believes top—down models rely too heavily upon an innovative administrator, and therefore, are slow to spread.
Rather, he intends “to rely on the creative capacity of students and do a bottom up project that will allow really anyone in the academic hierarchy to create and curate knowledge and share it freely with the world.”
As the bottom-up model relies on student initiative and participation, his goal in expanding the program has been to help students see the value of the resource, to see all that can be gained from sharing.
But finalsclub.org’s expansion has been slow going. This semester, only Harvard and Berkeley have course materials available on the site—Harvard has course material available for seven classes, Berkeley for one.
Although the project’s adoption has been slow, Magliozzi remains hopeful.
“I would say that my ultimate goal would be for a groundswell of support to overwhelm open courseware, and I suppose make it the default at every school everywhere. But that’s a big ambition.”
CORRECTION: OCT. 1, 2011
The Sept. 28 article "New Finalsclub.org Helps Students Study" misquoted the website's founder, Andrew J. Magliozzi '05 as saying that his organization seeks to "create and carry knowledge." The quote should have read "create and curate knowledge"

The Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School announced last week that it will begin a new project to visit and document communities around the country undergoing efforts to promote diversity—racially, culturally, and linguistically.
The project, entitled “One Nation Indivisible,” is in conjunction with the Poverty and Race Research Action Council (PRRAC), a Washington civil rights policy organization.
“By telling and spreading stories about integration efforts ... we hope to better harness the potential of diversity and win more support for pro-integration policies and programming on local, state, and national levels,” the institute said in a press release.
Susan E. Eaton, research director of the Charles Hamilton House Institute, will serve as co-director of the project along with Gina Chirichigno of the PRRAC. Eaton said that the project would publicize the communities studied through written narratives, videos, presentations, and conventions with national experts. The organizers also hope to hold one large national conference, most likely in the Capitol in the spring, Eaton added.
“I’m trying to combine the rigor of academia with storytelling.” she said.
Eaton explained that the motivation for the project originated from her previous work with the institute, as well as research showing the harm of racial segregation and the benefits of racial integration efforts.
She said that it is necessary for communities to “move past assimilation and move to true integration that is mutually beneficial.”
The project will include communities across the country, from Framingham, Mass., to Portland, Ore., to Dalton, Ga.
Eaton said that she hoped the project will provide a widely accessible look into diversity initiatives around the country.
“We realized there are a lot of people who are saying integration is important, [but there are] not a lot of concrete examples we can point to,” Eaton said. “It should be celebrated and understood.”
Eaton said that while the project will recognize practical solutions to issues of segregation, it does not have direct political goals.
“Our goal isn’t necessarily to lobby,” Eaton said. “Our goal is that this will have an influence on policy [and] move these stories into national discourse.”

Since 1961, 1,219 Harvard graduates have joined the Peace Corps.
A panel discussion hosted by the Institute of Politics on Tuesday featured Harvard-affiliated Peace Corps veterans who spoke about their experiences and challenges during their time spent abroad.
All of the panel members stressed the influence the Peace Corps had on their lives. “I think my Peace Corps experience has been much more important than my Harvard College education,” said Steven B. Bloomfield ’77, the executive director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
The Peace Corps now faces competition in recruiting college graduates from other public service programs, including Teach For America.
However, the Peace Corps has seen a major increase in applications on the national level since 2009, a phenomenon known as the “Obama bump” because of the current administration’s push for youth to enter public service.
Panelists highlighted the intense three month training process, the protection of the U.S. government, and structured programming as benefits of the Peace Corps experience.
Panelists also discussed the merits of entering the Peace Corps right after college.
Kristin M. Sulewski, who is currently getting a masters degree in international education policy from the Graduate School of Education, said her experience as a Peace Corps volunteer in Benin directed her graduate course of study.
During Sulewski’s service in 2009, Kate Puzey, a fellow Peace Corps member and friend also serving in Benin, was allegedly murdered by a local school teacher. The incident attracted national media attention and prompted inquiries into the Peace Corp’s safety protocols, including U.S. Congressional hearings last May about the rapes and deaths of volunteers.
Sulewski said that despite the tragedy, she and her other friends who served in Benin would recommend joining the Peace Corps.
The majority of the audience members were undergraduates, and many expressed interested in applying to the Peace Corps in the future.
“It would be a great way to travel and go to Africa at the same time,” said Ralph A. “Tre” Hunt ’15, who is planning to concentrate in African and African American Studies.
A few audience members said they were already planning to apply to the Peace Corps, but that this event reaffirmed their plans.
“It’s really great to get the perspective of those who have actually gone through the experience,” said Angela D. Primbas ’12, a government concentrator.
The Harvard Peace Corps Recruiter and other Peace Corps staff members were also present to answer questions on the recruiting and application process.
The event was part of the IOP Office of Career Service’s increased effort to put on “Career Roundtable Discussions” to help undergraduates learn about and find jobs in public service.

Habitat for Humanity International CEO Jonathan T.M. Reckford spoke at the Graduate School of Design last night, urging increased cooperation between governments, businesses, and non-profit organizations to tackle the need for affordable housing.
Reckford’s talk, titled “Three Myths About Affordable Housing” and organized by Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies, focused on debunking the “myth” that affordable housing is “someone else’s problem.”
As Reckford explained, housing attracts investment and spurs job creation, benefiting entire communities. A lack of housing, in contrast, can undermine health care and job spending.
“In order to provide affordable housing for all, the public, private, and non-profit sectors have to come together,” he said.
Within this model of cooperation, Reckford said the role of non-profits should be to engage local communities. His organization partners with community members in building basic houses and selling them at affordable prices. The homeowners’ monthly payments are then used to build more houses.
Reckford announced that next week, in recognition of World Habitat Day on Oct. 3, Habitat for Humanity will dedicate its 500,000th house in Maai Mahiu, Kenya, and begin construction on its 500,001st house in Paterson, N.J.
When the floor was opened up to audience questions, a number of attendees inquired about Habitat’s response to the recent increase in foreclosed homes. Reckford responded that instead of building homes from scratch, the organization has ramped up its efforts to rehabilitate abandoned houses. Last fiscal year, Habitat worked on 4,500 houses for repair and rehab, up 100 percent from the year before, according to Reckford.
Among the attendees was Ryan R. Mohling, a second-year student at the Harvard Kennedy School who worked at Habitat for Humanity last summer. He said it was “exciting to see Habitat invited to such a prestigious lecture,” and that it reflected increased cooperation between different sectors on the issue.
Eric S. Belsky, the managing director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies, emphasized the unique perspective Reckford brings to the housing discussion. By focusing on its economic significance, people have “lost sight of how important housing is for individuals,” he said while introducing Reckford to a full audience.
Reckford joined Habitat for Humanity as its CEO in 2005, previously serving as a pastor in Edina, Minn. Throughout his talk, he brought up experiences from his travels outside the U.S., where 90 percent of the families served by Habitat reside.
Reckford said it has been a privilege for him to interact with families on a personal level and see their lives transformed by Habitat’s work. “It fills me with an urgency to make sure other families have that chance,” he said.

The number of disciplinary cases reported to the Administrative Board last year was approximately two-and-a-half times higher than the year before, an increase that the Secretary of the Ad Board attributes to a year-old reform which has encouraged professors and students to turn in more students for academic dishonesty.
In the 2010-11 school year, the Ad Board had 272 disciplinary cases, according to John “Jay” L. Ellison, the secretary of the College’s primary disciplinary body.
In the previous two years, the case load was approximately 150 in 2008-09 and 110 the year after, Ellison said.
For the first time last year, a recent set of reforms took effect.
The reforms, approved by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in May 2010, broadened the penalties which the Board can choose when evaluating academic dishonesty cases.
From 2004 to 2009, before the reforms went into effect, more than a third of students who were reported for plagiarism and similar offenses were required by the board to take time off from Harvard. Another quarter were placed on probation—a time of strict monitoring for further misbehavior—while the rest had their cases dismissed with no punishment or an admonishment.
Members of the Committee to Review the Ad Board, a group of three professors and one student, said in their 2009 report that the harsh punishment of required withdrawal most commonly meted out to offenders led professors to be wary of reporting academic dishonesty cases at all.
History of Science Professor Anne Harrington, who teaches the General Education course “Madness and Medicine,” said that under the old rules, “The assumption that there’s only one way to deal with cases was seen as too rigid.”
In an attempt to remedy that sort of concern, the board now has the option under the 2010 reform to choose two less serious penalties—a failing grade in the course in which the dishonesty occurred, or “local sanctions,” a range of responses taken by the course professor in consultation with the board.
Ellison said that it is this last category of disciplinary response that has been most effectively utilized since the reforms took effect.
“Cases are going back to the faculty for in-class response,” Ellison said. “They can decide if they want to fail the paper, make them re-write it, sit down with someone in the writing center.”
He said that after the new rules were determined, he communicated them to faculty members through a variety of meetings and to students through their teaching fellows, House tutors, and certain undergraduate organizations. He attributed last year’s notable increase in disciplinary cases in large part to these outreach efforts, which have prompted professors as well as students to report incidents.
“We’re hearing from students reporting on their peers more too,” Ellison said. “[Students understand that] when a student comes to the Ad Board, it doesn’t necessarily mean that their career is over.”
Other reforms also prompted by the committee report include small subcommittees in which students meet with two or three members rather than the entire board of about 40 members, as well as new authority for the Faculty Council, a 19-member group, to expel a student without input from the rest of the Faculty.
A sophomore who was summoned by the Ad Board on an academic dishonesty complaint last year said he believes that under the new subcommittee process, “you have much more opportunity and prerogative to defend yourself.”

CORRECTION: September 29, 2011
An earlier version of this story incorrectly calculated the increase in the number of the Administrative Board's disciplinary cases. The total number of 2010-11 disciplinary cases was two-and-a-half times higher than the year before not one-and-a-half-times higher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former President of India Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam spoke last night about his plan for empowering people living in rural areas of the world.
Kalam’s presentation, called “Empowering 3 Billion,” was hosted by Harvard’s South Asia Initiative as part of an annual talk honoring Mahindra Ugine Steel Company founder Harish C. Mahindra ’46.
Kalam started by addressing the world’s most pressing issues, from unsafe drinking water to illiteracy.
“These are no longer problems of individual nations,” he said. “The world today is integrally connected through environment, people, economy, and ideas.”
Kalam, who served as India’s head of state between 2002 and 2007, was called the “People’s President” and the “Missile Man” because of his underprivileged background and promotion of domestic nuclear weapons technology.
In his speech, Kalam discussed his vision for the world in 2030 and how India is working to achieve it. Kalam spoke of a “beautiful world” in which the gap between rich and poor narrows, all citizens have education and health care, governments eliminate corruption, and nations are led by “creative leaders.”
Kalam pointed to India’s “Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas” program as a key example of a government initiative that is successfully combatting economic inequities.
The program brings urban resources to poor rural areas so that these regions can become self-sufficient over time.
Kalam emphasized that “creative leadership” will be critical to reduce economic disparities in India. He said that economic development connects to creative leadership through person-to-person interactions, including customer loyalty and employee satisfaction.
Sai S. Balakrishnan, a graduate student in urban planning and an Indian citizen, said the idealism and the style of leadership Kalam cited were reflective of his presidency, though she added, “I wish there was more about how he injected idealism into his political life.”
Naushard M. Cader, a Harvard Kennedy School graduate, said Kalam is known as the first president of India to be more than a government figurehead, and called his presidency a “golden period” because of his dedication to engagement with the people.
Kalam said that in order to address social inequities in the long term, individuals must be “righteous in the heart” and lead by example.
Kalam told the audience they could start to individually work for peace by reciting a pledge, which drew laughter and applause: “From today onward, I will make my mother happy. If my mother is happy, the home is happy. If the home is happy, society is happy.”
Members of the audience appreciated Kalam’s tactic of offering personal solutions to global problems.
Gauri S. Subramani, a senior at Wellesley College, said she enjoyed Kalam’s “micro-approach” and his encouragement of interpersonal relationships to achieve peace and development.
“At the end of the day, it’s all about people,” Cader said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s endowment returns of 21.4 percent in fiscal year 2011, announced last week, beat benchmarks and were the highest in recent memory. But since the close of the fiscal year on June 30, the markets have shown extreme volatility, with some indices moving 4 percent daily.
While analysts applauded the recent returns of the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University endowment, the portfolio’s significant holdings in public equities expose it to these market swings.
Harvard’s gains in the past year represent the first major step in recovering losses that resulted from the 2008 financial crisis, when the endowment’s value plunged by nearly 30 percent, from $36.9 billion to $26 billion.
Since then, HMC  has been reestablishing the value of the endowment—which yielded an 11.4 percent return in the 2010 fiscal year. It has done so while adopting a more conservative risk management structure to weather volatile markets. Analysts agree that the current year will begin to test the new risk structure as HMC fights to regain its pre-crisis endowment value.
THE FUTURE
Harvard has not said how it has performed since the end of June. After the close of the fiscal year, a number of factors caused concern for the broader financial community.
In August, the Standard & Poors rating agency downgraded U.S. Treasury debt from AAA to AA+ and further gave it a “negative outlook.”
At the same time, uncertainty about Europe’s fiscal future has increased, with investors questioning the abilities of Greece, Italy, and Spain to pay back their sovereign debt bills.
Even though HMC has actively reworked its positions in certain asset classes and specific securities to reduce risk—even hiring a chief risk officer in 2009 to help with the restructuring—Harvard will still be affected by these large fluctuations. “We are not immune to those impacts,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in an interview last week.
Risk management is crucial, said Mebane T. Faber, a fund manager at Cambria Investment Management Inc. and co-author of “The Ivy Portfolio: How to Invest Like the Top Endowments and Avoid Bear Markets.”
HMC currently has about 12 percent of its portfolio invested in foreign equities. While that asset class is considered an area of great opportunity, volatility in Europe has threatened its performance in the months since Harvard’s fiscal year ended. And U.S. markets have also seen extreme swings in recent weeks.
But the financial problems in Europe may deal a relatively softer blow to Harvard due to the endowment’s low-risk stance, according to Cathleen M. Rittereiser, co-author of the book “Foundation and Endowment Investing,”
Because Harvard’s portfolio is designed to limit volatility compared to many for-profit funds, HMC’s investments might have fared better over the last few months than the S&P 500 Index, which has dropped 10.9 percent since June, she said.
Because of the efforts to reduce volatility, “in tougher years, the endowment should do better than the S&P,” said Lawrence E. Golub ’80, who runs Golub Capital, a private equity and venture capital firm.
“A lot of the pain that Europe is suffering is already priced into the financial markets,” Golub said. “I hope they only have limited exposure to the sovereign debt of risky European countries.”
Rittereiser also noted that the sovereign debt difficulties of a nation may not be reflected in the fiscal health of companies within that country. But if half of Europe’s banks need to be rescued, every investor will suffer, Golub said.
THE PAST YEAR
Although HMC’s gains on the year once again put the endowment in the vicinity of its $36.9 billion peak, Harvard underperformed the S&P 500 stock index. Analysts, however, say the endowment should be judged by a different standard.
Because HMC’s portfolio is diversified far beyond U.S. equities, which the S&P tracks, its results will naturally be different from the index, Rittereiser said.
“It is not an appropriate benchmark,” said Rittereiser of the S&P 500. “It is kind of like comparing apples to oranges.”
HMC sets its own policy portfolio benchmark, a custom metric that Rittereiser said is the best way to measure endowment performance because it reflect’s HMC’s unique risk appetite.
“I would be willing to say that it is highly likely that the risk-adjusted returns [of HMC] would be better than the S&P,” she said.
Every one of HMC’s asset classes outperformed its policy portfolio benchmark, except for private and public equities. Historically, private equity has been an enormously successful investment for the University.
Harvard and other universities were among the earliest investors in private equity, though the asset class has not performed as well in recent years due to greater competition in the industry.
Though many of Harvard’s closest peers have yet to release their endowment reports for 2011, it appears so far that Harvard has achieved above average returns. The University of Pennsylvania posted an 18.6 percent return for the last year, while Cornell’s endowment rose 17.2 percent.
But Stanford’s endowment, which released results earlier this week, rose 22.4 percent, a full percentage better than Harvard.
But like Mendillo, Stanford’s investment chief sees a bumpy road ahead.
“We remain concerned about the uncertain macroeconomic climate and its impact on global financial markets,” said John F. Powers, CEO of the Stanford Management Company, in a press release.
While Harvard appears ahead of the pack, Golub warns that the University cannot expect such exceptionally high returns on a regular basis.
“If you told me an endowment manager made 21 percent or more every year, I would say you’ve found Bernie Madoff,” Golub said.
Still, many remain confident that HMC will be able to weather upcoming financial storms.
“[Mendillo] is doing an outstanding job of building confidence in the alumni community that HMC is being a successful and responsible steward,” Golub said.

Harvard Business School Professor Rebecca M. Henderson and stem cell researcher Douglas A. Melton—who teaches at the College and Harvard Medical School—were appointed University Professors Tuesday, joining a cadre of 22 other faculty members who hold the University’s most prestigious professorship.
The position, which was created in 1935 by the President and Fellows, seeks to recognize exemplary faculty members who have pushed the boundaries of their discipline.
Henderson becomes the John and Natty McArthur University Professor—created in honor of the former HBS dean and his wife—while Melton becomes the Xander University Professor.
“I’m honored beyond words,” Henderson said. “I’m completely humbled when I look at the other members of the group I am in.”
In a statement, President Drew G. Faust called Henderson—who studies the way organizations respond to technological shifts in the environmental arena—“a leading voice on the environmental challenges of our time.”
Along with HBS Professor Forest L. Reinhardt, Henderson co-directs the “Business and the Environment” initiative, which seeks to bring together faculty from across the University to solve environment problems facing businesses.
Although he described Henderson as “one of the leading strategy scholars in the world,” Reinhardt placed particular emphasis on his colleague’s abilities as a teacher.
Henderson “combines traditional hard analytic understanding of the way the world works ... with a new set of important concerns” relating to the environment, Reinhardt said.
Henderson, who has also taught at the Sloan School of Management at MIT, came to HBS in 2009.
Like Henderson, Melton is both a prolific scholar and a lauded teacher.
Although he began his career studying developmental frog biology, Melton shifted his research focus to stem cell biology when two of his children were diagnosed with diabetes.
Described by Faust as “a scientist who has played a seminal role in the exponential growth of the new field of stem cell science,” Melton has made significant breakthroughs in stem cell research.
Melton, who also serves as Co-Chair of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology, has worked to found and expand the new Human Developmental and Regenerative Biology concentration, which SCRB Lecturer William J. Anderson said “owes its success to Dr. Melton’s tremendous output.”
Melton, who serves as Co-Housemaster of Eliot House with his wife, Gail, is also a prolific teacher, teaching or co-teaching five courses in the 2011-2012 academic year.
His teaching style and willingness to accept undergraduates in his lab have earned rave reviews from students.
Melton “is always questioning everything behind the process of what he is teaching,” said Taylor A. Docter ’13, who took SCRB 10: “Human Developmental and Regerative Biology” with Melton last fall before joining Melton’s lab in the spring.
Docter had been planning to study abroad this past summer in Cambridge, United Kingdom, but she was so impressed by Melton’s lab that she abandoned her plans to go overseas in favor of staying in Cambridge, MA to work for her professor.
For his part, Melton said he was “thrilled and humbled” by Harvard’s decision to appoint him to the professorship.
“I hope I can live up to the University’s expectations,” he said.

Harvard executives and employees received far higher salaries in 2009 than their counterparts at the 19 other wealthiest universities in Mass., according to a study released Tuesday by the Center for Social Philanthropy at the Tellus Institute.
The average of the top eight Harvard employees was more than three times the average of the top eight employees at the nearest runner-up—Boston University.
The study follows a two-year investigation that used public tax records to deduce the salaries and benefit packages of the top executives at the universities, which included MIT, BU, Tufts, Wellesley, and Boston College.
Study authors worked closely with unions in the Massachusetts area in creating the study, including SEIU Local 615, the union that represents
Harvard custodians and security guards.
The study showed that Harvard executives’ salaries topped the list in all categories except for president’s income: BU President Robert Brown’s $1.04 million package edged out University President Drew G. Faust’s salary of $822,000.
Harvard’s top paid executive, Harvard Management Company Managing Director Stephen Blyth, made $6.4 million in 2009, nearly three times the salary of the next highest earner.
Joshua Humphreys, the primary author of the study, said that the motivation for the investigation was to increase transparency in universities across Boston.
“The emphasis for the research was really transparency,” said Humphreys, who has taught at Harvard. He added that the push for transparency was especially important during 2009 because of the economic crisis and the massive cut-backs on labor that universities instituted.
This contradiction was frequently referenced in the report.
“The financial crisis of 2008-09 appears to have done little to dampen the size of compensation packages received by the most highly paid college officials, even as colleges themselves have
imposed draconian cuts upon programs and lower-level staff, often in response to sharp declines in the value of their endowments,” the study reads.
Humphreys said he was surprised to find that among the universities he surveyed, 20 people made at least $1 million—and Harvard is home to 11 of them.
“I did not expect there to be a top 20 list of people being compensated over a million dollars in the very year of the financial crisis’ most devastating impact on university budgets,” Humphreys said.
Harvard’s higher compensation can partly be explained by the Harvard Management Company, which manages the University’s endowment and operates on a more corporate model.
Salaries for top members of the HMC are more typical of a hedge-fund manager than an educator.
“HMC’s compensation system contains many important features, including performance incentives that are measured against market benchmarks; incentives that are paid over time to ensure sustained performance; and clawbacks to avoid undue risk taking,” University Spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email statement. “In several cases, the payments reflect an accumulation of several years’ positive performance relevant to market benchmarks.”
Humphreys acknowledged that Harvard was an outlier because of its large endowment, but stressed that all public Universities have a duty to spend their money transparently.
“Universities should be true to their public mission—there’s a social contract that they have with the public which is granting them large public subsidies,” Humphreys said. “When colleges are looking more like hedge funds with libraries, then people are expressing concern.”

It’s not every day that W. Nicholas Haining receives an email from the White House, and he said that he certainly took notice.
“There’s a small part of you that imagines that somebody’s pulling your leg,” said Haining, assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. “Obviously, there was a little bit of disbelief, but after I realized it wasn’t someone pulling my leg, I was absolutely delighted.”
Haining is one of four Harvard faculty members who were named recipients of the 2011 Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers, the government’s highest honor for those in the early stages of their independent research careers, according to a White House press release Monday. Nationwide, 94 scholars won the award.
In addition to Haining, Harvard’s winners were Tina A. Grotzer, associate professor at the Graduate School of Education; B. Price Kerfoot, associate professor of surgery at the Medical School; and Ali Khademhosseini, associate professor of medicine at the Medical School.
The goal of the awards is to help support young researchers in an effort to “tackle grand challenges and contribute to the American economy,” according to the White House release. Winners are selected on the basis of not only quality of research but also leadership in community service, including mentorship, education, and other forms of outreach.
“It is inspiring to see the innovative work being done by these scientists and engineers as they ramp up their careers—careers that I know will be not only personally rewarding but also invaluable to the nation,” President Obama said in the release.
Winners receive a five-year research grant, funded by various government departments, Khademhosseini said.
With the increasing difficulty of obtaining funding in today’s economic climate, the awards will have a significant impact, Haining said.
“The general concern shared by a lot of scientists is that there are more good ideas that can be tested than there are research grants to support the research that goes on,” he said. “Science is always a meritocracy, so I think that there always has to be some competition to show that your research project is worthy of getting funded. But I think it’s also true that in recent years, the number of projects that get federal research dollars has decreased.”
Although the White House emphasized the awards as indicative of Obama’s prioritization of science research, the most recent federal budget cut funding for organizations such as the National Institutes of Health, which funds much medical research.
Still, the award recipients credited the administration with being aware of the needs of science.
“[The Obama administration’s] funding priorities have been very thoughtfully forward thinking,” Grotzer said. “They are willing to invest in things that may have significant payoff and to try things that are different, and to really push the envelope.”

Even after playing one varsity sport in the spring, sophomore Kyleigh Keating wanted more.
After playing lacrosse last year, Keating committed herself over the summer to joining Harvard field hockey. Though Keating played both sports in high school, doing the same at the Division I level is more difficult and time-consuming endeavor.
“It takes an exceptional person and an exceptional athlete to be two-sport athlete at the Division I level … and be a student at Harvard,” said Harvard field hockey coach Sue Caples.
But Caples said she was confident that Keating would be up for the challenge, in large part due to Caples’ awareness of Keating’s level of play in high school.
Three years ago, the field hockey coach eyed Keating and recruited her with the hopes that she would join the Crimson. To Caples disappointment, Keating decided instead to accept an offer from Harvard’s lacrosse team.
After the end of her first lacrosse season, Keating expressed interest in joining the field hockey team and eventually decided to do just that.
“We were thrilled that she decided to join the team,” Caples said. “She’s a tremendous athlete … and has a wonderful personality.”
Although Keating hadn’t picked up a field hockey stick in close to two years, she impressed her coaches before the season even started.
“I was convinced that she had been playing field hockey for the past two years,” Caples said. “She looked like she hadn’t missed a beat.”
From there, she has continued to improve according to her coach.
“She is getting better every day,” Caples said.  “It’s just a matter of getting the touches again to get up to speed. Her skills have improved to match her speed and athleticism.”
Soon after the season got underway, Keating had a coming out party against Quinnipiac. While the Crimson lost in a close match, the sophomore sparkled, scoring her first collegiate goal and then following it up with a second score later in the game.
“We needed to be really intense that game and I thrive in situations like that,” Keating said.
Thanks in large part to that breakout performance, Keating is currently second on the team in shot percentage and tied for third in goals.
“She seems to be in the right place and at the right time,” Caples said. “Was I surprised [by her performance]? absolutely not.”
Keating’s growth was suddenly put on hold last weekend when she tweaked her ankle and was forced to sit out Sunday’s game against Bryant University. Although the team was able to pull out a 2-1 victory, Caples said that Keating’s presence on the field was missed.
“It’s unfortunate I got hurt this weekend,” Keating said. “Hopefully I’ll be back soon at the same pace I was going at.”
But she also said that the slight injury shouldn’t slow her progress too much and that she would be playing again by the next match.
As Keating continues to figure out how to balance playing two varsity sports, she will have multiple sophomore teammates to turn to. Mariah Pewarski and Morgan Powell are also members of both the field hockey and women’s lacrosse teams.
“[Pewarski and Powell] definitely made me realize that it was a possibility,” Keating said.
For their parts, Pewarski and Powell have praised the value of playing two sports.
“[Powell and I] … were talking about how cool it would be to be in-season year-round,” Pewarski said. “Kyleigh loves field hockey. I think she just missed it and saw that we were able to handle [playing both].”
Keating believes that her time on the lacrosse team proved useful as she acclimated herself with the field hockey squad.
“Already having played a sport at the college level really helped with the intensity,” Keating said. “Obviously my stick skills were a little rusty at first and still aren’t as good as the girls who played year long. It’s one of those riding-a-bike skills.”
Although Keating admits that she will be at a slight disadvantage compared to those who focus on a single sport all year, she said she wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I consider it an advantage because I love both sports and I get to do both of them,” Keating said. “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’ve ever been on a tour of Harvard Yard—actually, let’s be real, if you’ve ever been in Harvard Yard—you’re sure to have heard tour guides from the obnoxious (see: “Hahvahd” Tours) to the factually inaccurate (I once overheard a guide at the head of a large group of Chinese tourists claim that the Pig on the Porcellian gate was there because “Harvard reveres the pig for its wisdom”). And they freely bellow the fact that Harvard has the most (41) varsity athletic teams of any institute of higher education in the world.
We on the sports board of the Crimson cover all of them. You, our readers, hopefully read about all of them too. And of course, our roommates, friends and classmates fill out the rosters of each of these teams. But one thing that we writers, students and tourists have to grapple with is how many of us actually care about that magical “41”?
Sure, we all were excited last year when the men’s basketball team won its first Ivy League championship ever, and rightfully so. But the team only represents about two percent of Harvard’s varsity sports.
You, the pre-med taking five classes, do you care that Alexandra Kiefer ’14 won the national championship in fencing last year as a freshman? And you, the future politician who frequents the IOP, does it really matter to you that rower Andrew Campbell ’14 is taking a semester off to train for the 2012 Olympics? What about that Ivy Championship season in softball?
The answers, one can assume, range from ‘No,’ to ‘I care in the same way I care that eight U.S. Presidents attended Harvard.’ In other words, not much beyond a collective pat on the back.
In October’s edition of The Atlantic, Taylor Branch wrote a brilliant piece titled “The Shame of College Sports.” His story outlined, and in many ways underscored, what those of us who pay attention to big time college sports have known for years: that the two hallmarks of the NCAA—amateurism and the student-athlete—are fraudulent.
Two of the most memorable college athletes of the last decade, Reggie Bush and Cam Newton, had their parents receive large, and illegal, sums of cash in return for their talents. One of the defining football teams of the decade, the Miami Hurricanes, had 72 players receive benefits from boosters, ranging from cash and entrance to night clubs, to prostitutes. What’s even more disturbing is that none of this is new. Even the original Olympians of ancient Greece were often paid mercenaries who traded allegiance between city-states in the pursuit of greater wealth.
Last Sunday the Crimson field hockey team won a game against Bryant University, 2-1, to improve their season record to 4-3. After the game, coach Sue Caples did something remarkable. Rather than celebrate and send the team on its way, she had them shake hands with the Bulldogs, and assistant coach Jen Long issued the four-word order that every athlete dreads: “Get on the line.”
Caples’ 25 players calmly approached the midfield line and went through their post-game jog. Afterward some of them went to meet friends, others went back to their dorms to rest and others still made the trek to Lamont to finish a problem set or study for an upcoming midterm. There was no night club bouncer waiting for them, nor an exclusive luxurious dorm—just the normal anonymous lives of a Harvard undergraduate.
Former Harvard President Charles W. Eliot, class of 1853, once famously said of Harvard’s baseball team:
“I’m told the team did well because one pitcher had a fine curve ball. I understand that a curve ball is thrown with a deliberate attempt to deceive. Surely this is not an ability we should want to foster at Harvard.”
Folksy naivety aside, Eliot was a firm believer in amateurism, the importance of athletics in conjunction with academics, and the significance of sport as a worthy endeavor regardless of the result.
Indeed, as an undergraduate Eliot raced in the famous Harvard-Yale regatta, and was one of many students to sing a commemorative song that included the line:
“The race must come before the prize, the cross before the crown.”
Though I’m sure there is much that Eliot would dislike about today’s Harvard, it is heartening to know that 150 years later, there are still student-athletes staying true to an ideal that far too many have preached, and far too few have lived.
That is why I care.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a tough defeat against Holy Cross and starting the second-string quarterback on Friday against Brown, the Crimson offense needed a spark.
Harvard’s tight ends helped provide that spark.
In the first quarter, sophomore tight end Cameron Brate reeled in an acrobatic catch against Brown. The 31-yard one-armed grab was instrumental in Harvard’s first scoring drive that put the Crimson in command, 7-0, early in the game en route to a comfortable 24-7 victory.
Brate, who earned his starting role after playing on JV last year, led Harvard that night with five catches for 93 yards against Brown.
He also leads the team with eight receptions for 152 yards through two games.
And this past week, he was awarded DI-FCS Tight End Performer of the Week by the College Football Performance Awards and won the Ivy League’s Rookie of the Week honor.
But he is only one of two impact tight ends for the Crimson.
Junior tight end Kyle “Juice” Juszczyk is notable for more than the consonant string in his name. Unlike Brate, Juszczyk already has his share of varsity experience.
Last year, he led the team with four touchdown receptions and had 234 receiving yards on 25 catches. With multiple catches in five different games in 2010 and 11 catches for 124 yards and three touchdowns his freshman season, he has consistently been a stalwart on the Crimson offense.
Together, this fun-loving, hard-working tandem forms one of Harvard’s key offensive weapons.
Traditionally, a tight end finds himself caught between two worlds. On the one hand, they are routinely called upon in crucial moments to have the playmaking ability of a wide receiver—the sure hands, the ability to break tackles, and the bursts of speed.
But at the same time, they are expected to have the mentality of a lead blocker, putting their bodies on the line for the benefit of the team. The versatility required to play the position is tough to come by.
“I love the tight end position, as I have always been a naturally versatile player,” said Juszczyk, who attended Cloverleaf High School in Lodi, Ohio. “In high school I used to play quarterback, running back, and wide receiver.”
The duo is in many ways the engine of the offense. At the beginning of pre-season, Harvard coach Tim Murphy decided to instate a two-tight end offense. Murphy attributes this to the athleticism and physicality of his players.
“It’s a luxury not many teams have because we can play any set,” Murphy said of this offensive style in a postgame press conference. “It’s really tough at a no-huddle pace for [opponents] to figure out what we are trying to do. We have not had that luxury of having two really athletic [and] physical tight ends [in the past].”
Juszczyk and Brate have certainly helped carry the load so far. The duo has 14 receptions and more receiving yards—191—than any pair of wide receivers.
The two are also on the field together for roughly 90 percent of offensive snaps, according to Juszczyk, who enjoys more opportunities than last year, when he split time at the tight end position.
Their relationship off the field is nearly as dynamic.
“Cam has become one of my really close friends … [He]’s a goofball,” Juszczyk said. “Sometimes, we’ve got to remind him to be serious—even during the game, [but] when it comes down to it, he’s always focused.”
“It’s a quarterback’s dream to have those two tight ends,” quarterback Colton Chapple said in the postgame interview. “They’re big. They’re fast. They’ve got great hands.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Buffalo Bills and former Harvard quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 has enjoyed quite a bit of attention recently for leading a perennially underachieving team to an unblemished 3-0 record. After Fitzy’s heroics against the Patriots, ESPN named the former Crimson star as the top player in this week’s Cross-Sport Power Rankings.
That was just one of several ESPN features on Fitzpatrick in recent weeks. Another that has grabbed the attention of many (including our very own Greg Mankiw) was an interview with Fitzy during ESPN’s NFL Sunday Countdown.
Rachel Nichols sat down with Fitzpatrick to talk about what everyone else talks to Fitzpatrick about: what it means to play in the NFL without having come from Auburn, LSU, Florida, etc. Instead of letting this bit be like the hundreds of interviews that discuss how hard it is for a Harvard man to throw a football, the segment added a new twist.
Find out after the jump!
A smiling Nichols surprised the Bills quarterback with a quiz on economics—Fitzpatrick’s concentration at Harvard. After closing his eyes and regretting his decision to sit down, the Harvard man coolly answered the two questions Nichols asked him—though he stalled a little with a Rex Ryan story in order to come up with Keynes.
Pretty funny of ESPN to pop quiz Fitzpatrick, huh? Well, though the idea and humor came from the network’s writing staff, the questions did not. ESPN reached out to the Harvard Economics department to come up with a series of basic questions for the show to ask Fitzpatrick. The task of coming up with these multiple-choice questions fell to David Johnson, Head Teaching Fellow for the wildly popular Harvard course Ec10 (no wonder Mankiw liked it so much).
Johnson gladly put together a quick, five-question exam to test how much Fitzpatrick retained from Mankiw’s course. Here’s the original pop quiz (courtesy of Mr. Johnson):
1.  Who is the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the U.S.?
a.  Timothy F. Geithner
b.  Lawrence H. Summers
c.  Ben S. Bernanke
d.  Muammar Gaddafi
2.  "QE2" refers to:
a.  A type of expansionary monetary policy used recently in the U.S. because short-term interest rates were already zero.
b.  A type of expansionary fiscal policy used to bail out failing investment banks on Wall Street.
c.  The code name for the so-called "Buffett Tax" the President has included as a part of his deficit reduction plan.
d.  A big ship on which tea is served at 4 p.m. daily.
3.  Who was famous for saying, "In the long run, we're all dead."?
a.  Milton Friedman
b.  John Maynard Keynes  (pronounced "canes" as in "rains" OR U of Miami's team NOT "keens" as in "jeans")
c.  Adam Smith
d.  Rex Ryan
4.  The total value of goods and services produced in the U.S. last year (U.S. GDP) was approximately:
a.  $14.5 trillion
b.  $14.5 billion
c.  $14.5 million
d.  $14.50
5.  Even WITHOUT a contract extension (which is imminent, no?!?), which of the following represents your (Ryan's) average U.S. federal tax rate?
a.  14.1%
b.  18.9%
c.  22.5%
d.  28.2%
According to the show’s producer, Zac Budman, Fitzpatrick “did well,” though no word on what his final score was. If Fitzy’s Wonderlic performance is any indication, then the Harvard man probably missed just one question. In any case, we should stop doubting Fitzpatrick’s intelligence, as should the rest of the world, especially ESPN. The man got a near-perfect SAT score, for crying out loud.
P.S.: Here are the answers for those of you who didn’t pay enough attention to Mankiw ...
1. C
2. A
3. B
4. A
5. D

The Adams House dining hall staff has encountered some thorny problems in the past few days: syringes left on trays in the dishroom.
In an email sent out to Adams residents on Tuesday night, Resident Dean Sharon L. Howell said that syringes have been sent to the kitchen on trays via the conveyor belt for dirty dishes recently.
"This poses an unacceptable health risk to our staff," Howell wrote in the e-mail.
Howell wrote that the person responsible for the syringes has not been identified.  She informed students that needles can be safely disposed in the  bathroom in C-entryway.
According to Adams House Master John G. "Sean" Palfrey '67, there were no needles attached to the syringes that were left behind in the kitchen. He also said the syringes were used to deliver a topical medicine.
