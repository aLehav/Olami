After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is the moment for alternative voting systems. As Americans come to realize their dissatisfaction with the two-party duopoly that dominates our political system, the opportunity is ripe for new, better ways of choosing our elected leaders. But this doesn’t mean that new voting systems are destined for public acceptance, and sloppy management of elections has the potential to unduly impugn the credibility of systems that are actually better for voters. New York City’s instant-runoff voting mayoral primary this past summer showed how new voting systems are often blamed for the failures of the bureaucrats who operate them poorly.
This New York City voting fiasco might just repeat itself at Harvard. In 2018, Harvard’s Undergraduate Council adopted Rank and Add voting, a more flexible system that allows voters to express preferences for all candidates they like and rewards candidates who attract the broadest support, for its elections. But the UC incorrectly managed this year’s presidential election, and if not fixed, this threatens to undermine students’ faith in Rank and Add for no good reason.
A central premise of Rank and Add is that voters can rank as many or as few candidates as they please in order of their preference. It necessarily follows that a voter who only ranks three candidates in a six-candidate race cannot rank any candidate past the third spot. This means that there can never be more total votes in a lower rank than a higher one.
Harvard Undergraduate Voters Choose requested the full breakdown of the recent UC election results, which the UC did not release to the student body. There are more total sixth-place votes than fifth-place votes, which is impossible in Rank and Add. While we cannot determine the exact number of defective ballots, there were at least 36 (the difference in the number of sixth and fifth place ranks). Each of these 36-plus ballots should have been disqualified. In this case, the actual results of the election would not have changed — but the same error could skew elections in the future if left uncorrected.
Ideally, the UC would be more transparent and effective at all stages of the election, clearly explaining Rank and Add on the ballot itself and adopting a software that doesn’t allow ballots to be cast improperly. The president of Harvard Undergraduate Voters Choose reached out to the UC Election Commission, and a representative said that they are interested in transitioning to a new platform that would allow them to do just this. If they cannot find such a platform by the next election, the UC should comb through the anonymized ballots manually and remove every incorrect one. Election integrity is crucial, and a hassle is no excuse to run an election improperly.
After elections are run, the UC must also explain the results to students. A key premise of Rank and Add is that each rank amounts to a certain number of points for each candidate. Every first place rank receives one point, every second place one half a point, third place one third of a point, and so on. This means that candidates often end up with fractions of points, despite a whole number of votes being cast. When the UC announced this year’s presidential election results, it stated that the winners, Michael Cheng and Emmet de Kanter, received 967.4 votes. This likely makes little sense to the average student, who isn’t familiar with Rank and Add and hasn’t even received an explanation of how the system works from the UC. And by making students fish for the full results by request, instead of releasing them proactively, the UC denies the student body the opportunity to fully understand Rank and Add and how it works in their elections.
The New York City Board of Elections decimated public confidence in instant-runoff voting by running a sloppy, incompetent mayoral election. The UC should avoid doing the same for Rank and Add.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Classroom to Table is back — but with coffee as the only menu option. The popular, student-founded program, where Harvard paid for students to grab meals with their professors and instructors, is back after a pandemic-induced hiatus, albeit in a new and more limited format. The new edition, dubbed “C2T: Coffee Break,” will offer participants a $10 voucher to have coffee and pastries at the Pavement Coffeehouse in the Smith Campus Center — a far cry from the $30 for a proper, sit-down meal at a selection of local restaurants that the program boasted in the past.
We are glad to see Classroom to Table return, even in this rebranded and trimmed-down form. Despite its limited allowance, Coffee Break offers a more casual alternative for those students who are eager to get to know their faculty better yet don't feel quite comfortable sitting down with them for a prolonged meal in a formal restaurant setting. We find it a great addition to the College's broader student-faculty programming, one that is well worth continuing in the future.
Coffee Break is not, however, an adequate replacement for the program's original, meal-oriented format.
Back in 2015, when Classroom to Table was first piloted, we praised the College for helping foster stronger relationships between faculty and students, arguing that these extracurricular interactions could enrich our academic experience and render instructors less intimidating. Since then, the program has proven extremely effective at doing just that, financing hundreds of dinners and lunches and skyrocketing in popularity. Our peers and faculty members have repeatedly embraced the chance to get to know one another, thinking, debating and laughing out loud over drawn-out multi-course dinners and quick pizza-centric lunches alike.
We believe that its success is owed, in no small part, to the idiosyncrasies of grabbing a meal with someone: of setting aside a substantial amount of time, sitting down, and exchanging thoughts over food. Eating with others is inherently and historically a social endeavor, a cornerstone of how we interact and bond with family, friends, and everyone in between. Coffee-drinking, on the other hand, is nice enough but brief. Even the new initiative’s name, with the inclusion of ‘break,’ seems to emphasize conciseness, a short respite from work rather than an experience in and of itself. Of course, meaningful interactions can happen anywhere — some students might well find themselves enjoying a life-changing cappuccino — but we find the original setup undeniably more conducive to longer, deeper interactions.
The shift from a full meal to a latte and a scone comes with other downgrades, too. Under the new C2T: Coffee Break, students and faculty have no option but to meet at the Smith Campus Center, right across from the Yard. That is, the space that is supposed to host our informal faculty-chaperoned breaks from the Harvard bubble is now sandwiched among studying students. While Pavement might serve fine coffee, drinking a cup of it at the very heart of our campus hardly offers the same breath of fresh air as going to Russell House Tavern or the Hourly Oyster House once did. Notably, the benefits were bidirectional: In the past, local businesses reported a boom in business connected to the initiative, a boost that would come in handy as our community struggles to recover from the ongoing pandemic.
The pandemic was the reason Harvard cited for halting the program in the first place, arguing that the College did not want to incentivize indoor dining given the health crisis. We find that logic flawed (we’ve been eating in dining halls all across campus since the first day of the semester!) and unconvincing. We fear that Classroom to Table is yet another of Harvard’s perennially under-resourced student-founded programs — look no further than the First-Year Retreat and Experience pre-orientation program, which struggled for years before being institutionalized by the University. Despite its popularity and obvious benefits, Classroom to Table has been consistently underfunded and embarrassingly forced to go on hiatus term after term after term after term.
While the College has already suggested that sit-down meals might make a return to the program next spring, we encourage Harvard to truly buy into Classroom to Table for the first time: to provide both quick coffee and full sit-down meal options, and to allocate adequate funding to keep it available throughout the entire term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The humanities are easy. Or so goes the cant of most Harvard students. And who can argue with them? One can reasonably be worried about failing an organic chemistry exam, but such a feat would be almost commendable on an English essay. Our STEM classes expect a lot more out of our students than our humanities classes do because there are tangible things that any student who completes Stat 110 or Physics 16 must know. The humanities are not inherently easier. In fact, they are far from it; after all, a brilliant philosopher is much rarer than a math genius.
Humanities courses need to challenge their students to know the material thoroughly and to have considered its significance deeply. In other words, they need to be more rigorous.
It is all too common to sit through a section discussion on the weekly reading where at most 25 percent of students have actually done the reading. Why should they? If they don’t turn in their Math problem set, they will fail. On the other hand, if they don’t do the reading, their teaching fellow won’t hound them with questions to prove that; it won’t even affect their grade. When the time comes they can glance through one of the books and write an essay that is good enough, by virtue of their natural intelligence, to earn an A-, meanwhile they’ve not learned anything the whole semester. Such a story must become foreign to the experience of any Harvard student.
There is ample room for improvement in the rigor of humanities courses. On the most basic level, professors and teaching fellows must assure that students actually know the material. If a student demonstrates a negligent attitude to completing reading assignments that student should see a change to his or her grade. At the same time, students who want to receive high marks should know more than the vague picture of what happened but should be required to have considered the reading deeply.
The undemanding character of many humanities classes stems from a pedagogical aversion to factual knowledge. It is few and far between that students in a literature class actually have to memorize verse, and if they do, it may be only a few lines. The internet has made many people feel as though they do not actually have to know historical facts, for they are so accessible to them. However, without poems and historical references festering in their minds, these facts are of no use. The internet’s resources allow us to draw connections, to make allusions or analogies with greater ease, but it is impossible to be reminded of something and perceive its relevance when it only exists on our smartphones. Information held only by our computers isn’t knowledge. Facts become knowledge and effectual only once they are possessed by people.
Students are dissuaded from concentrating in the humanities because it is too difficult to demonstrate one’s talent. One must feel challenged to believe what they’re doing is worthwhile. Though one may force oneself to take up the burden of the humanities by spending hours contemplating assigned philosophy readings or considering how primary sources in a history class relate to the themes apparent from the textbook, no student is truly forced to do this. Even so, effort seems to be enough to gain the approbation of the teaching staff. If Harvard wants to produce alumni who will make significant contributions to thought, it ought to start asking more of its students. It is extremely difficult to actually understand Plato, Milton, or Polybius, but far easier to make decently well-argued assertions about them.
The future of rigor is not hopeful. Princeton’s recent dismissal of a Greek or Latin requirement to receive a degree in the Classics is highly concerning. Reading translations is always a hindrance to true appreciation of a text, and learning a language is always an exercise in working hard to develop fluency. Receiving a Classics degree without fluency in these languages is akin to receiving a Math degree without knowing basic calculus. The Math department doing such a thing would be unthinkable. So why is it done in the humanities?
Consider high school art class. Art, not being as academic as the other subjects, or so we were told, cannot expect students to be expert painters or masterful actors. Therefore, As are given to any student who tries hard. Does art not require just as much natural skill as any other subject? The equivalent skill in science is just more closely tied to traditional markings of intelligence like IQ, which, according to those who want Harvard to only admit those with the best of test scores, is some sort of magical superiority index. Of course, IQ is no more valuable than being an outstanding ceramicist, and we should treat both competencies equally. As an awful artist, I should not have received a good grade in high school art class. Students should not expect to get As in subjects in which they are not particularly gifted, and very few of us are gifted in many things. A skilled writer may rightly fail a high-level math class, but it would be exceedingly rare for the reverse to happen.
Ultimately, we are scared of ranking anything which isn’t objective. Math has right and wrong answers, so a teaching fellow could never give an A to a student who wrote that 2+2=5. A math class also has a more straightforward set of information that must be known by the student. Selecting which interpretation of Augustine is correct or what scenes from “The Tempest” a student should have remembered is subjective.
Yet professors and teaching fellows know more than us. They have to be confident in their assertions about what is necessary to know and what is a reasonable or unreasonable argument to make. One must understand the subjectivity of the humanities, but simultaneously hold that there is Truth out there, and expect students to make a decent stab at it.

During a year of virtual rehearsals, Shang Wang ’24, a member of Harvard’s Radcliffe Choral Society, thought about leaving the group “a trillion times.”
With students away from campus, RCS members practiced by recording themselves singing along to a track and remained on mute throughout the Zoom rehearsal. It was Wang’s freshman fall and her first experience with the chorus, one that she called unfulfilling.
She stuck it out until the group returned to in-person rehearsals and performances this fall, though, and she is now enjoying the group so much that she attends board meetings and plans to get more actively involved in event planning.
“This year, it’s exceeded my expectations,” she said.
After more than a year of adapting to virtual programming, Harvard’s vibrant performing arts groups have roared back to life. Though they have faced challenges adhering to Covid-19 restrictions, artists said the ability to come together in person again is well-worth it.
Performing arts groups at Harvard span dozens of disciplines. According to the Office of the Arts, professional and student-led ensembles produce around 500 concerts annually. The schedules for Sanders Theatre and Lowell Hall alone feature 100 student rehearsals and more than 100 performances a year.
Students say they are drawn to joining performing arts groups for a myriad of reasons: continuing their high school hobbies, exploring artistic interests, or seeking out a particular social scene.
Cordelia Yu ’24 said she was drawn to the Asian American Dance Troupe despite the virtual format her freshman fall not only by the welcoming energy from upperclassmen, but also the desire to reignite a hobby that she previously gave up.
“I feel like dance was something I dropped in high school,” she said. “So I wanted to get the interest back up.”
Alexandrea G. Harriott ’22 joined the Harvard Kuumba Singers her freshman spring. She found fulfillment both extracurricularly and socially in Kuumba, which is a Swahili word that means “to create.”
“I first joined because I wanted to get more into the Black community on campus, and I felt like they were really a staple of that on Harvard’s campus,” she said.
Angel G. Hoyang ’23 is involved with the Harvard Ballet Company, the Modern Dance Company, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, among other performing arts groups on campus.
She said the Veritones have been the “most fulfilling” experience that she has had at Harvard so far, as it allowed her to explore different music styles outside of classical music.
Covid brought Harvard’s thriving arts scene to a screeching halt, leaving performers scattered across the globe and auditoriums empty. Students reported mixed experiences with their performing arts groups during the virtual school year, but most said they remained members.
“I guess you can’t really compare the past two years, this year and last year, just because they’ve been so radically different,” said Ruben A. Fonseca Castro ’24, who joined the Harvard Wind Ensemble and the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra in fall 2020.
Yu, similarly, drew a sharp contrast between her experiences both years, calling the online version and the in-person version “two separate experiences.” Some groups did not meet regularly at all, and some students in the groups that met found themselves not getting the most out of virtual rehearsals.
“We didn’t meet regularly at all, ever really,” said Benjamin R. Meron ’23, a member of the Harvard Undergraduate Drummers, or THUD. He said he was drawn to the group by its creative style that uses unconventional percussion — and occasionally acting — in its humorous shows.
“I saw this group at Visitas, and I thought, ‘This show was the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen in my life,’” he said.
Virtually, though, being a part of the group was less satisfying.
“Maybe we had a couple socials with some of the members who just wanted us to get together on Zoom and play games, but we didn’t have any sense of rehearsals — the club basically just didn’t exist,” Meron said.
Hoyang said the virtual year had a greater negative impact in a cappella than dance because of a cappella’s dependency on feeling the other singers’ energy.
“Just in general, dance doesn’t have to be done with other people — it can be a very solo endeavor,” she said.
“We learned how to work with space virtually and digitally, and in a flattened space of 2D-ness rather than 3D-ness we were used to,” Hoyang added. “But the same cannot be said of a cappella because as a format, it depends on everyone working at the same time together.”
Dramatic art was also affected, according to Mira S. Alpers ’24, the director of the First-Year Musical last year and the director of this year’s contemporary play “This is Our Youth.”
Alpers, a Crimson Arts editor, said her directorial interests — interpersonal dynamics and how people connect with one another — were not as successful with virtual theater due to lag and pre-recorded material.
“Virtual theater’s weird,” she said. “I think some people in the midst of the pandemic, who were trying to look on the positive side, were like, ‘Oh, I hope this is an enduring art form.’ And I don’t hope that — I don’t think it needs to be.”
Despite varying experiences during the pandemic, all eight performers interviewed for this article said they have appreciated the return to normalcy.
Mira S. Becker ’24 choreographed a dance for the Harvard Radcliffe Modern Dance Company this semester, after a year on Zoom during which she said there was “no way” she could have done so.
“​​To create a final product was just really rewarding, especially after so long of being on Zoom,” she said. “Just to have it performed in front of me was very exciting.”
Yu, also a dancer, said in-person rehearsals have been an enhanced learning experience.
“It’s still nice to just physically see how formations are changing when you’re onstage, how the lighting works, which is something I had never done before because you just edited videos,” she said.
Meron said one of his favorite parts of this semester was meeting new faces, especially with significantly more incoming members this fall.
His freshman year, THUD took six new members, but this year, they’ve taken 11 because of the lack of auditions last year.
Now back on campus, some artists, like Wang, are planning to pursue or have already taken up board positions in their groups. Yu is the artistic director of AADT, and Hoyang is the incoming president of the Veritones.
Harriott, who is a senior, said that even though she cannot give “100 percent” of her time to Kuumba, she still finds herself going back for “solace.”
“You go to Kuumba because it gives you something like a type of solace that doing these other things isn’t going to give you,” she said of in-person rehearsals.
“I’d rather that — coming back with just a breath of fresh air, and being loved, and creating in that space,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Instructors at the Harvard Division of Continuing Education can now accomodate teaching students learning both in person and remotely in nearly every classroom thanks to the portable technology software HELIX.
Portable HELIX units were adapted from the original HELIX Classroom, which was developed during the pandemic to support online learners and enhance the remote student experience. HELIX technology, an acronym for Harvard Extension Live Interactive Experience, was first designed as a classroom equipped with microphones, speakers, large screens, and a camera operator to allow students participating remotely to hear and see their classmates.
Remote students’ faces are displayed on large screens for the class to see, and the camera — operated by a technician from the DCE’s Teaching and Learning department — allows for remote learners to view their peers. Currently, there are eight HELIX classrooms outfitted with this technology, but the portable HELIX unit is capable of transforming almost any room into a classroom.
Professor Henry H. Leitner, who serves as associate dean for Information Technology and chief innovation officer for the DCE, praised the HELIX technology for bridging the gap between in-person and remote students and their instructors.
“You see students who are also participating live, but they are geographically remote,” Leitner said. “It could be literally in another part of the country or somewhere else in the world, so that as you're teaching, you can interact both with the students who are in the room, as well as students who are online.”
A key difference, however, between the HELIX classroom itself and the portable units is the use of cameras. Portable HELIX units omit the bulky camera equipment, screens, and operator in favor of individual students using Zoom to view classmates, augmented by high quality audio technology.
“The students who come to the classroom do have to use their laptops and have Zoom on, so that we don't have to have a videographer showing each of their faces in real time,” Leitner said. “We can use the camera from their laptops in order to capture their image when they're speaking."
Professors Daniel L. Smail and Matthew J. Liebmann used a regular HELIX Classroom last spring to co-teach General Education 1044: “Deep History.” While Smail taught students from the classroom, Liebmann gave remote instruction via Zoom in what he describes as a “seamless” experience.
Liebmann said he hopes to further implement this technology in his teaching, citing its potential use to bring students from different universities and geographical locations together. He also said he hopes to use the technology to include students from tribal colleges.
“I actually have a vision for one of my classes that would include participation from students at tribal colleges.” Liebmann said. “I can imagine trying to use the HELIX classroom to bring together Harvard students with the students who would be coming in remotely.”
Smail also lauded the technology, referring to the HELIX’s capacity to support “cross-campus learning” among students.
“If I were teaching a course with a colleague from the University of Chicago, then we might well have my students in Harvard Hall 101 with the other students at Chicago zooming in,” Smail said.
Adrienne Phelps-Coco, executive director of teaching and learning in the DCE’s Teaching and Learning Department, trains faculty to use HELIX technology — though she said the main objective of the training is to “take the technology out of their hands.”
“When we train the faculty, we really are not training them with technology. We're just training them to rethink how they interact with their students,” Phelps-Coco said. “What we've really found is that the first day of class sets the tone for the rest of the semester.”
Phelps-Coco also said the HELIX technology aims to foster connection between instructors and students even in a remote setting.
“We try to create the most human learning experiences that we can,” Phelps-Coco said. “It's not about delivering content. It's really about ‘how do we connect people to other people?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Faculty of Arts and Sciences committee released a proposal recommending the College replace its current “shopping week” course registration system with a system of previous-term registration.
The Committee on Course Registration was tasked in spring 2019 by FAS Dean Claudine Gay with reviewing the FAS’s current approach to course registration and making recommendations for improvement within three years. The group published its 49-page final report on Thursday.
Historically, Harvard students could freely browse courses during the first week of each term before finalizing a schedule. For the last three semesters, however, the University has instead held a virtual course preview period prior to the start of the term. The spring 2022 semester will also feature a virtual course preview period due to public health concerns.
Shopping week has long been a point of contention between students and the administration. In 2018, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh proposed a move to an early registration system, arguing that administrators were “no longer certain that the benefits of the shopping period are worth the costs.” Gay also expressed support for early registration in an October 2018 interview with The Crimson, saying the shift would ensure courses are “pedagogically successful” for students.
The committee was formed in the wake of those discussions. Chaired by Philosophy professor Bernhard Nickel, it wrote in its report that shopping week was “very popular with undergraduate students who appreciated the opportunity to have a real experience with a class and its teaching staff before enrolling.”
“Indeed, we suspect that few aspects of our academic system see quite as much, and as strong, approval among undergraduates as the practice of registering for courses via a ‘Shopping Week,’” the report reads.
Yet, the committee found that the “high degree of uncertainty” caused by the structure of shopping week “undermines the teaching mission of the College.”
“[Shopping week] also gave rise to several major areas of concern that impact the overall quality of undergraduate education, including loss of instructional time at the beginning of the term, broad variation in how and when courses with enrollment limits decided to which students to offer spots, and uncertainty around enrollments,” it continues.
The committee also rejected the pre-term registration system used during the pandemic, citing its “drawbacks” including the inconsistent release of course information before the start of the term.
“For students, Pre-Term registration occurred during a time of unpredictable commitments as students were busy moving back to campus or completing jobs or internships,” the report reads. “Everyone lost a significant part of their semester breaks.”
Instead, the committee recommended that the FAS move to a system of previous-term registration, which would be “required to meaningfully reduce the enrollment uncertainty that leads to many problems.”
Under the committee’s proposal, students would be limited to enrolling in four courses during the enrollment period, which would be in November for spring courses and April for fall courses. Incoming first-year students would have until the end of July to register for courses in the fall term.
However, the committee also recommended that add-drop processes during the first week of class “be as unconstrained as possible.”
The committee proposed the implementation of the pre-registration system in fall 2023 for the spring 2024 semester, as “course registration during the fall term for the subsequent spring is much simpler.”
The Faculty has yet to announce a vote on the proposal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate School of Education plans to launch a fully-online master’s program in Education Leadership as part of its efforts to increase access for mid-career professionals, HGSE Dean Bridget Terry Long said in an interview Wednesday.
The new program is an outgrowth of an online, part-time cohort the school accepted through a one-time summer admissions cycle in 2020.
“When we went remote, we realized just how many talented, dedicated people are out there who want a master’s degree in education, who are not able to move to Cambridge, and so we’ve launched an online master’s degree,” Long said.
“[The program is] really focused on that group of people who would not otherwise be able to come to Cambridge, so it’s really about access, and new populations of students who want to benefit from Harvard,” she added.
Long said the program’s first cohort will arrive in summer 2022, and that the school will likely give students the ability to “come to campus for short periods of time” during the two-year duration.
Students currently enrolled in the remote, part-time program have voiced frustruations over remote course offerings and their lack of access to campus. In the interview, Long acknowledged those frustrations and said HGSE remains committed to accommodating remote students.
“When we committed to saying you could take the degree online, we wanted to guarantee for students who don’t have the ability to move to Cambridge that we could support them to degree completion and they wouldn’t have to come,” Long said.
Long defended the school's remote learning offerings.
“We decided to have half of our courses online because we were so committed to the online students, and in some ways that was safe for us, given the fact that the Delta variant and Covid hurt so much,” she said.
“But this is the difficulty of being in a complex university with every tub on its own bottom — you try to maximize the opportunities, but you can’t quite control,” Long added.
In addition to increasing access through online programming, Long said the school is working toward creating a more engaging student experience in its newly-redesigned master’s curriculum.
The restructured program will graduate its first cohort in spring 2022. It features new Foundations courses held prior to fall term — which will become mandatory for future cohorts after this year — that Long said are an opportunity to “build a relationship with faculty, with teaching fellows” before starting at HGSE.
“We’re hearing a lot about the benefits of that — about how it reduced levels of anxiety, how it helps people feel part of the community and feel included, again, before they had even started,” she said.
Despite ongoing uncertainty over the Omicron variant, Long said the school is working to provide current and recently-graduated students with opportunities to visit campus through “homecoming” events in January and May 2022.
“[These] would be concentrated weekends to invite both those who graduated in spring 2021, as well as those who are continuing in the online program, [to] just have a chance to come to campus, to have some faculty lectures, to have social networking events,” she explained.
Those events would complement the joint commencements in May for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, which the University announced in November.
“The cohort that started fall 2020, as well as the ones that are continuing to this year, they never had a chance to come to campus,” she said. “We know that was a huge desire at some point to come, not just to come to campus, but to also meet their faculty, to meet each other in person.”

The committee charged with determining when Harvard should remove the names or representations of individuals from its buildings, programs, and professorships released a final report Thursday recommending a “careful, painstaking, and laborious” process for making denaming decisions.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow created the Committee to Articulate Principles on Renaming in fall 2020 in response to criticisms about certain historical figures whose names or portraits were honored across campus. The group aimed to answer when past advocacy for “activities that many members of our community would today find abhorrent” warrants removal of such recognitions.
Chaired by former University President Drew G. Faust, the committee included administrators, faculty, students, and alumni from several of Harvard’s schools. Its final report set out a framework for considering denaming requests grounded “in historical inquiry.”
“As we consider removing names, we should examine these lives with humility, recognizing that our own ideas and behavior may one day be looked upon with dismay by generations to come,” the report reads.
The report also called for the University to ensure the time and resources it dedicates to the question of names and tributes to historical figures do not detract from other substantive work.
“As we act in more self-conscious ways about the names that help to define our community, we must also recognize that such consideration represents just one dimension of a necessarily broader institutional commitment to confronting inequity and exclusion,” it reads.
Per the report’s recommendations, requests for denaming University entities should be submitted to the dean of the relevant school. If the Dean chooses to proceed, they will consult the University president, who will decide whether the request should be handled on a school or University level.
“Schools will have broad latitude to develop approaches that suit their Schools and the circumstances of particular requests,” Bacow wrote in an email to affiliates Thursday.
The strongest cases for demanding or removal will demonstrate that recognizing the individual in question “creates a harmful environment that undermines the ability of current students, faculty, or staff to participate fully in the work of the University,” the report reads.
Reviews of removal requests will also examine if the entity in question plays a central role in the identity or experience of Harvard students, staff, or faculty and whether the addition of “plaques, performances, and portraiture” could instead provide missing context.
“We should approach our history through reckoning, not forgetting,” the committee wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council elected a new secretary and treasurer and passed legislation to endorse an independent audit of its own finances in an emergency meeting over Zoom Wednesday evening.
The meeting was held to complete agenda items slated for last Sunday’s meeting, which was derailed by accusations of bullying and a prolonged presidential and vice presidential inauguration. Pending legislation from the inaugural meeting carried over into the emergency meeting as well.
Wednesday’s meeting began with the elections for the secretary, treasurer, and the communications chair. UC members made nominations, which were then followed by speeches, questions, and deliberations.
The council voted to elect Pforzheimer House Representative Jane J. Oh ’24 as secretary and Crimson Yard Representative Ethan C. Kelly ’25 as communications chair. The UC reelected Winthrop House Representative Kimani E. Panthier ’24 as treasurer.
After the elections, the UC passed legislation to “start fixing the UC’s financial mismanagement” through an independent audit and financial training.
Last month, campaigns for the UC presidency alleged that the council lost large sums of students’ money and was committing tax fraud by failing to register as a non-profit. The previous president and vice president refuted those accusations.
“There have been serious allegations of the UC mismanaging hundreds of thousands of dollars in students’ fees from the $200 student activities fee,” the legislation reads.
The bill states that the entire UC must “fully cooperate” with an audit of its finances run by Harvard Risk Management and Audit Services. It must also release any requested documents to auditors within 48 hours of a request. Additionally, the results of the audit report will be released directly to students. The UC will also solicit feedback and questions about their finances from students to pass along to the auditors.
The bill also allows Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24 to work with “financial professionals and members of the Economics Department to organize a financial literacy and management training” for all UC members.
It will also give the executives and the finance chair the ability to speak with faculty and staff sponsors about the “possibility” of the UC filing taxes. This comes after the UC made a constitutional amendment to remove the provision which required it to register as a non-profit, clarifying its tax-exempt status under the University.
The legislation was sponsored by UC president Michael Y. Cheng '22 and de Kanter and passed with a vote of 21-0-0.
The UC also passed an act to gauge students’ need for mental health services via a survey which will be released during finals period.
According to the act — sponsored by Cabot House Representatives Brooke L. Livingston ’23 and Damien Z. Chang ’24 and Mather House Representative Shruthi S. Kumar ’24 — the survey will help the UC launch a pilot program with a group therapy company called "/tbh." to address students’ mental health needs.
Noting the long wait times for Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services, the legislation states that the partnership would aim to provide “regular, identity-based group therapy sessions for students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard physicists documented the existence of a new state of matter, paving the way for potential applications in quantum technology.
The state of matter, known as quantum spin liquid, has special properties that produce long-range quantum entanglement — a phenomenon in which particles’ states are connected despite spatial separation — according to the team’s paper published in Science last week.
Scientists first predicted the existence of quantum spin liquids about 50 years ago, but had not been able to detect it in experiments, according to Giulia Semeghini, a postdoctoral fellow in the Max Planck-Harvard Research Center for Quantum Optics and lead author of the study.
Semeghini said that the group decided to take a new experimental approach by trying to create a quantum spin liquid themselves instead of searching for it in existing systems.
“A few theorists at Harvard came up with an idea on how to actually create this phase, instead of in the usual setting where it was looked for, which were basically solid systems — condensed-matter systems — how we could recreate it using our atoms,” Semeghini said.
The group used a “programmable quantum simulator” — a quantum computer that uses lasers to reproduce a physical setting and manipulate atoms’ geometry and interactions — to successfully recreate the predicted state of matter, per the paper.
Scientists can use the special properties of quantum spin liquids to develop coveted quantum technologies like quantum computers.
Semeghini said that standard quantum computers have individual quantum bits, or “qubits” — particles that can encode information — that are very “fragile against external perturbations.”
With quantum spin liquids, however, one could create a “topological qubit” which stores information in the topology — the shape — of a system, as opposed to a standard qubit that stores information in the state of a single object, Semeghini said. Because topology is very hard to break, the topological qubit is very resistant to error.
Scientists could theoretically use topological qubits to build a topological quantum computer that is “masked to errors,” said Physics professor Mikhail Lukin, senior author of the study and co-director of the Harvard Quantum Initiative.
Lukin said the group has only created a “baby version” of the topological qubit that is far from being useful for actual application, but that the finding is exciting nonetheless.
“It’s very much fundamental physics, still, what we’re doing,” Lukin said. “But the fact that we can create such states, and we can really play with them, we can poke at them, we can actually kind of talk to them and see how they respond — this is what’s exciting.”
The discovery comes as Harvard’s new Quantum Science and Engineering Ph.D. program is accepting applications for its first cohort, which will be admitted in fall 2022.
Lukin said that the study demonstrates the value of the interdisciplinary program.
“This kind of recent advance, it really combines advances in experimental physics, in theoretical physics, computer science, but also in things like engineering,” Lukin said. “We would like to basically educate a new generation of students who would be fluent in all of these things, which is unprecedented.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a prolonged delay in the search for ethnic studies faculty, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said that “there’s no wavering of commitment” in her promise to hire a cluster of scholars in the field.
After decades of students and alumni activism on behalf of ethnic studies, Gay announced in June 2019 that the FAS would hire three to four senior faculty in Latinx, Asian American, and Muslim studies by the end of the 2019-2020 academic year — the first step towards establishing a formal ethnic studies program at Harvard.
The search for the faculty, which was paused in April 2020 due to COVID-19, has now stretched more than a year past that initial deadline. In October, Gay told The Crimson that she would “probably” update affiliates on the search progress by semester’s end.
In an interview on Wednesday, Gay said the search is “still underway,” though she declined to comment on whether any offers have been extended at this time.
“It's just the reality of the process that it takes time, and individuals also need to decide about whether or not coming to Harvard at this point in their career is the decision that they want to make,” Gay said. “So we need to respect their time as well.”
“We're very much on track across all of these hires,” she added.
Gay described the ongoing cluster hire, along with the recent donations from alumni to support Asian American Studies, as the starting point for recruiting “a critical mass of intellectual leaders” in ethnic studies.
When asked about the University’s plans for growing tracks in ethnic studies beyond Asian American Studies, Gay said she hopes that the recent gift serves as “a source of inspiration” to the “broader alumni community, who also may want to find ways to contribute.”
Additionally, she said the FAS is tapping into its $51 million surplus from fiscal year 2021 to “accelerate our efforts to attract and recruit diverse and exciting scholars across the full breadth of the FAS.”
Gay declined to comment on the potential suspension of the graduate program in American Studies, which is currently facing an external review from the Divisions of Social Science and Arts and Humanities.
Beyond faculty hires, Gay discussed the recommendations put forth by the Task Force on Visual Culture and Signage in its report, released earlier this week.
The report “really captures an inspiring and very ambitious vision for the future of our shared spaces,” she said.
Gay said she was “committing the resources that are necessary to refresh the visual culture” in the spaces the report identified as priorities for visual renovation — the FAS Faculty Room, Annenberg Hall, and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Center in Lehman Hall.
Gay also encouraged individual units, such as the College’s upperclassmen houses, to consider the report’s recommendations as they “reimagine their local spaces.”
“I hope it will generate its own momentum and encourage ongoing, active, intentional curation of our spaces,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Baring it all in the season’s first snowfall, hundreds of Harvard students gathered outside Wednesday night in jackets, underwear, and little else to resume the boisterous tradition of streaking around Harvard Yard the midnight before finals.
At the stroke of midnight, students sprinted around the Yard from Hollis Hall — the starting line for Primal Scream, which biannually marks the close of reading period. Some students ran scantily-clad, others not clad at all. The tradition — which resumed after an unofficial three-semester hiatus due to remote learning — goes back to at least 1995 as a way to let loose amid the stress of finals prep.
By 11:59 p.m. Wednesday, hundreds of students at varying levels of sobriety lined up, gallivanting from Harvard Hall to Stoughton Hall. Undergraduates, jumping up and down, chanted “Olé, Olé, Olé,” “let’s go Harvard,” and the bassline of “Seven Nation Army.”
As a church bell in the distance rang out like a starting pistol, the raucous crowd tossed aside their puffer coats, towels, and undergarments for a celebratory lap au naturel as onlookers cheered from the University Hall steps. Post-run, some unclothed participants even posed in front of the John Harvard statue for group photos.
The last time Harvard students observed Primal Scream was two years ago on a tepid 60-degree day. Despite Wednesday’s slippery conditions, this year’s Primal Scream seemed to draw greater participation than fall 2019.
Luiz Guilherme F. “Gui” Abudi ’25, a freshman from Brazil, said he is used to more tropical weather, but that Wednesday’s snow was one of the reasons he participated in the race. Instead of his birthday suit, however, Abudi opted to embrace the approaching holiday season by sporting a Santa Claus costume.
“I’m wearing a Santa costume, right?” Abudi said. “Christmas in the cold, as opposed to Christmas in the tropics, just feels right.”
For Abudi, his participation in the race was a spiritual experience.
“I think it’s a godsend because it was the first snow day of the year and you got to run naked in the streets,” Abudi said. “It must be something God-related, you know?”
It wasn’t a perfect experience, however. Abudi rated it an 8.5 out of 10.
“I thought it was going to be longer,” he said.
Benjamin J. Dreier ’22-’23 said it was “really interesting to experience nakedness,” though was unsure whether the event would relieve his stress.
“I’m going to be stressed before this and I’m going to be stressed after this, but it was a great break,” Dreier said.
Ja’Karri S. Pierre ’25 and Jose Miguel C. “Miggy” Antonio ’25 both described the experience of spectating Primal Scream as “10 out of 10.”
“It was nice seeing some of our friends go through it,” Antonio said. “Traditions like these help solidify the Harvard experience.”
Previously, Harvard University Band members clad in their signature red uniforms — sans pants — would play for the Primal Scream runners. Pierre, a band member, said the band could not make it this year, but will return next semester.
Matthew B. Karle ’23-’24 — who said he finished the run third overall — said he gave his all to achieve a podium position.
“I really put my heart into it. I’m excited for future endeavors in the sense that I think I can do even better,” Karle said, adding that he recently recovered from a hamstring injury.
Karle, who also participated in fall 2019, noted this year’s event featured far fewer people fully nude by midnight and far more onlookers.
“There was a substantial crowd by the finish line,” Karle said. “I appreciate the support, but what are you doing in that Canada Goose?”
Karle said it was his “dream ever since Covid” to keep the Primal Scream tradition alive and make it to the top.
“I have to thank my friends and family and everyone who supported me,” Karle said. “Maybe in the future, you’ll see me doing laps out there in the Yard, no doubt. I also did it for Dunster. Go Dunster.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After his freshman year was truncated by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Roderick P. “Roddy” Emley ’23-’24 said he is slowly adjusting to life back on campus.
Emley spent his gap year working as a field organizer for the Biden campaign.
“It took a while to get back into gear,” Emley said. “I honestly hadn't had a really set schedule for a while, and so it was just adjusting back to that was definitely different.”
While he said part of him feels like a freshman all over again, Emley noted that a significant part of his semester has been reconnecting with old friends.
“Most of my blockmates I hadn't seen since we left campus and so it was like, ‘Oh my God, we're back in person, and this is exciting,’” Emley said. “But we’ve also had these 18 months where we've had very different life experiences that have changed us.”
For a vast majority of Harvard undergraduates, this school year marked the transition back to on-campus living and learning, after the Covid-19 pandemic scattered students across the globe in March 2020.
A year and a half later, when the College invited back all undergraduates to campus, some students said this semester has been an adjustment period to the idiosyncrasies of the “new normal” Harvard experience.
“You just had really no sense of community,” Alexandra P. Grayson ’22 said about life on campus last year. “I was in a suite of four people, and that was pretty much who we ever saw just because of all the Covid restrictions.”
Di Ai, a tutor in Lowell House, described the residential experience last year as “a little creepy.”
“It's completely silent. No one's in the halls. All the lights are always off,” Ai said. “So I definitely appreciate everyone being back. It’s a lot more energetic this year.”
Ai said he also found it challenging to foster camaraderie among students in his entryway, since all events had to be held over Zoom.
However, this semester Ai said he has enjoyed hosting in-person events again, such as his League of Legends watch party in the Lowell screening room.
Another facet of house life abuzz following a dormant year are the dining halls.
Though Harvard University Dining Services resumed full-scale operations this semester, some students said that they miss some of the pre-pandemic menu offerings.
“Our dining hall staff has obviously worked really, really hard. They're still short staffed and — love them so much — they do a lot of great things,” Grayson said.
“But there’s been some minor changes that just feel weird, like they're trying to brush under the rug, like there used to be an omelet bar,” she said. “There’s only vegan entrees now; it's not just vegetarian or vegan.”
HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin said that the HUDS menu is “constantly evolving based on taste, based on trends, based on the needs of students.”
“In the fall, it just was part of the menu plan to get things open and see how people were moving about,” she added.
Miguel A. Fuentes ’23 said “it was kind of a shock” to transition back into the Harvard social scene.
“It's weird socializing again after the pandemic because you couldn't — at least for most people — you couldn't go out with your friends, and stuff like that, or meet new people,” Fuentes said.
Even in the houses, where undergraduates traditionally see the most familiar faces, students said they are surrounded by new people.
“Usually when you enter the house, you meet people in chunks. When you first enter as a sophomore, everyone works really hard to meet you,” Grayson said. “But because no one knew anybody, I remember walking into the dining hall and being like, ‘Who are all these people? I have never seen you before in my life.’”
Grayson added that it was “stressful” gauging out people’s comfortability with masks and level of adherence to other Covid precautions.
“One not so great thing was just the beginning of the semester with all the uncertainty of not knowing, when you're hanging out with somebody, their socializing habits,” Grayson said.
“You don't know like, ‘Oh, should I be more spaced out from them because they hang out with lots of different people?’ or ‘Oh, they keep their movements really strict, I feel fine about them,” she added.
Some students said this semester has been “quieter” than pre-pandemic times, with many students electing to attend intimate gatherings over larger parties.
“Covid is still a thing for me, you know?” Emley said. “Just being aware of that socially, and so it's much more focused on getting meals or having a few friends over, but not big gatherings.”
Some students said the College’s indoor gathering restrictions — which, until November, prohibited indoor gatherings with more than 10 participants — shifted the social scene to invite-only off-campus spaces, such as final clubs, nearby apartments, and the Tasty Burger basement.
“This year has been hard because there's a lot of parties that I can't necessarily automatically go to. I have to find a friend who can get me on the list or find a friend and then pay money to get on the list,” Grayson said. “The great equalizer before was all the Quad parties.”
“It's just not accessible,” Grayson added. “By not having Harvard-approved parties, that's where you created sort of those divisions because the final clubs are in spaces that aren't owned by Harvard.”
While Covid-19 has caused an undesirable interruption to collegiate life, some Harvard affiliates explained how the pandemic evinced the strength of the Harvard community.
Lowell House administrator Elizabeth Terry wrote in an email that she predicted a “gap in the cultural experience” in the houses but said the “unique traditions and culture” remain.
“It feels almost like we had to start at ground zero in September, yet there was not much energy or staff to do that very effectively,” she explained. “It will be a slow rebuild. But the goal of offering an intergenerational House experience, with unique traditions and culture, remains.”
In addition, some students said an unexpected upside of this semester has been a newfound sense of understanding among students and faculty.
Rowena N. Wilson-Olivo ’22-’23, who has a chronic illness, said the shared experience of the pandemic “has made it a lot easier for students with disabilities on campus, students managing chronic illnesses to negotiate with their teaching staff and feel like they can take the time to be sick when they need to be sick.”
“I think also just having professors and lecturers and TFs have more of a frame of reference as to the vocabulary of sickness and getting well, I think there has been reconsideration of the role that health has to play in a setting like Harvard and that health is really important,” added Wilson-Olivo, who is a Crimson News and FM editor.
Tosca G. Langbert ’23-24 said she believes before the pandemic, “a lot of people were on autopilot — going through the motions of what they thought they ought to be doing.”
“My hope coming back for everyone was that we would all recognize how much of an opportunity being here together is and how the conversations we have in passing — or for you to be able to walk up to me in the dhall and randomly ask me about what I do — is a very limited resource,” Langbert said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten healthy players are all that remain at the moment for Harvard men’s basketball. The two-week break without competition — mandated for finals — could not come at a better time for the Crimson.
On most evenings at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard would likely be pleased with a 10-point win with such a reduced roster. Monday, however, was the latest bump in a non-conference schedule that has been far from friendly for the Crimson (6-4), as the team struggled to pull away from Division III Babson in a game that Harvard eventually won by a 74-64 score.
“We don’t have a lot of bodies, we’re hurt, we’re depleted, whatever, we could make all the excuses in the world, we didn’t,” said senior guard Noah Kirkwood of Monday’s contest. “We obviously had some rough patches during the game. I don’t think we’re happy with how we played, but at the end of the day, a win is a win.”
Though the Beavers won the DIII National Championship as recently as 2017, this iteration of Babson men’s basketball has gotten off to a 6-4 start yet found itself leading at halftime on Monday night. After jumping out to a 24-9 lead, the Crimson closed the first half in dreadful fashion — held to just one point in over nine minutes of play, ceding 16 unanswered points to Division III opposition on home court. Rather than taking a timeout, Coach Tommy Amaker preferred to let Harvard play through the situation.
“We really wanted to see how we could find ourselves, and fight, and we had different lineups, absolutely,” Amaker said. “Sometimes we try to do that, and let them figure it out.”
Babson represents the latest game in a three-game stretch against regional competition that has left something to be desired for a Crimson team seeking to establish itself as a legitimate threat before Ivy competition. Close losses against URI at home and on the road at UMass last weekend left the team in search of a statement victory against Babson — but the Beavers had no interest in rolling over easily. And though Babson’s crowd brought a raucous environment across town to Lavietes Pavilion, with no short of three sections packed to the brim with fans donning dark green, the larger issue for Harvard is the lack of healthy, experienced players.
A rash of injuries to frontcourt players Mason Forbes, Justice Ajogbor, and Bennett Pitcher have left the Crimson without a true big man, as none of the three have dressed so far this season. Senior captain Kale Catchings — pressed into duty as the de-facto big man — suffered an injury of his own and has joined the ranks of players in street clothes. With the added loss of senior guard Spencer Freedman, Harvard has been reduced to 10 healthy players and is essentially playing with a seven-man rotation. Junior forward Chris Ledlum was only able to play 20 minutes against Babson, departing due to injury.
“No doubt about it, we look like we’re worn down a bit,” said Amaker of the team’s performance over the past few games. “It is what it is. I don’t know what else to say. We have what we have, and we’re going to try to do what we can with what we have.”
As any fan or follower of Ivy League men’s basketball will certainly understand, overreacting to the non-conference slate would be a mistake. Wins and losses that matter in the Ancient Eight occur in January, February, and March.
But to say that the team’s health is of concern would be an understatement. To have a roster without a single healthy big man is a rare situation, and to play without one for an extended period can have far-reaching consequences. Wear and tear for Catchings, Ledlum, and Kirkwood — who are now asked to play inside due to the team’s lack of depth — seem practically inevitable. A point of emphasis for Kirkwood this season has been to improve and expand upon his game closer to the basket, in order to help establish an interior presence in the paint for a team that will sorely miss senior captains Mason Forbes and Kale Catchings.
“I feel like I can get comfortable with the step-back shot I have, and even though I feel like it’s a great shot for me, it’s in a lot of ways settling,” said Kirkwood of his focus on getting into the paint. “I took more of an emphasis today to get to the rim and to the line.”
Coach Amaker and his players have repeatedly refused to blame recent struggles on the team’s health or lack of big men, but the warning signs have been present since a loss to Siena, a program ranked 293rd out of 358 Division I programs in the KenPom Rankings. Six days after losing to Yale by 28 points on the same floor, the Saints were able to eke out a three-point win over a Harvard team that essentially played a seven-man rotation (first-year Louis Lesmond and senior Spencer Freedman combined for 10 minutes).
With games coming fast and furiously, the shorter rotations have taken a toll on the team. One of the squad’s priorities approaching the two-week break will be getting players healthy and rested. Games against Holy Cross, Howard, and a trip to Allen Fieldhouse to take on perennial blue-blood Kansas loom in late December before the Crimson open the Ivy League season against Princeton on Jan. 2.
“We’re hoping that we can get a little bit healthier, with treatment and health, and the things that need to happen for the guys that are banged up,” Amaker said. “We really need to hone in on the basics and the fundamentals, conditioning, blocking out, defending the ball, obviously our shooting.”
There have been several bright spots for the team thus far, however. Kirkwood has continued his strong play (16.2 ppg, 47 percent FG) and has emerged as a threat on the boards as well as showing a propensity for steals (nearly three per game). In many respects, Kirkwood is the heartbeat of this season’s team. Ledlum has continued his ascent towards being one of the Ivy League’s brightest stars, leads the team in scoring and rebounding (16.6 ppg, 8.9 rpg), and has tallied four double-doubles at a time when the Crimson is starved for effort on the boards.
Younger players on the team have exalted Kirkwood’s leadership attributes, particularly on a team that lacks significant upperclassmen depth.
“He’s been a great leader, especially for the freshman class,” Lesmond said. “He’s always here for us, on and off the court if we have questions, he gives us advice and shows us by leading by example.”
While Kirkwood and Ledlum are expected to lead the team from a scoring perspective, junior guard Luka Sakota has taken significant strides towards becoming one of the most reliable point guards in the league. The Etobicoke, Ont., native is averaging 12 points alongside nearly three assists and three rebounds per game and has helped cut down on turnovers from the point guard position. Sakota made two highlight-reel plays earlier in the season, hitting dramatic deep shots at the buzzer (one from next to the halfcourt logo) to send games into overtime against Iona and Colgate.
With injuries reducing the team’s front-line depth, first-year guards Denham Wojcik and Lesmond have stepped into the spotlight for the team, with the sharp-shooting Lesmond drawing a spot in the starting lineup against UMass and Babson. The Paris, France, native has seen a significant uptick in minutes during the team’s past few games and has shown a propensity to fire away from beyond the three-point line.
“It’s obviously a great opportunity, even more as a freshman with a team that trusts me,” said Lesmond of his expanded role. “Sometimes you have to step up, and I’m trying to do my best.”
Lesmond has taken 10 or more threes in three straight games (5-of-14 vs. URI, 3-of-11 at UMass, 3-of-12 vs. Babson), tallying a career-high 15 points against the Rams. Though several of the triples have come late in games, the stats tell the story of a first-year player thrust into the spotlight for an undermanned Crimson team.
Lesmond’s shooting represents a trend towards a three-point-focused attack that has come as much out of necessity as anything else. After years of watching the Crimson play through Chris Lewis on the interior, this iteration of Harvard basketball lacks a healthy big man to play a more traditional 4-around-1 style. The Crimson ranks in the top 35 teams in the country in percentage of points scored through three-pointers.
“We’re going to have to become a team that’s better percentage-wise, as a three-point shooting team,” Amaker said. “That’s got to be a weapon that we use.”
Still, there are certainly some concerning signs for Harvard men’s basketball through 10 games. The depleted health, particularly in the frontcourt, has forced the Crimson to play with grit and determination. It has also thrust players like Lesmond and Wojcik, who plays the majority of the backup point guard minutes, into the spotlight. Players like sophomore forward Sam Silverstein are playing minutes they might not have expected to at the outset of the season.
Despite these issues, overreacting to the non-conference slate would be a mistake. Though memories of watching injuries to Seth Towns and Bryce Aiken may be reawakened through the opening stanza of the campaign, the games that truly matter have yet to be played.
Like the seasons that precede this one, the goal that truly matters — and has lingered tantalizingly beyond the grasp of Harvard in recent years — is winning the Ivy League Tournament and qualifying for the NCAA Tournament. With Ivy Madness scheduled to take place at Lavietes Pavilion in March — a building the Crimson has proven worthy of defending over the past few years — there are certainly reasons to be optimistic.
The core of Kirkwood, Ledlum, Sakota, hopefully reinforced by front-court health and solid bench play from younger guards, has the potential to win the Ivy League Tournament. After several seasons of winning the regular-season title but losing the conference tournament, there can be no doubt that making it to March Madness is the priority.
Nothing else really matters.
