After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their third trimester are unlikely to pass on the virus or protective antibodies to their newborn, according to two peer-reviewed studies by Harvard Medical School researchers published last month.
The researchers examined two ways in which infected mothers could pass on the virus to their newborns: vertical transmission — the direct passage of the virus from the mother to the newborn immediately before or after birth — and placental infection — or passage of the virus into the placenta.
Although there have been documented occurrences of vertical transmission, the study published in JAMA Network Open found the transmission to be incredibly rare: none of the 64 mothers with Covid-19 enrolled in the study passed the virus onto their newborns.
The team also found that the virus was not detected in the bloodstream of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2, according to the study’s lead author, HMS assistant professor Andrea G. Edlow.
In another study published in Cell, researchers found that unlike influenza and pertussis — two common and highly contagious diseases like Covid-19 — SARS-CoV-2-specific protective antibodies were not transferred from the mother to the newborn.
The researchers were intrigued by the fact that the rate of antibody transfer seemed to be higher for women infected during the second trimester, as opposed to the third.
“We also had a cohort of women that were infected during the second trimester,” said HMS graduate student Caroline G. Atyeo, first author of the Cell paper. “And what we saw is that women that were infected during the second trimester didn’t show this compromised placental antibody transfer.”
Atyeo said she wanted to investigate more deeply what was causing this decrease in antibody transfer; she and her team hypothesized that it was linked to Fc glycosylation, or the attachment of different carbohydrate or sugar groups to antibodies.
Edlow — who was also involved in the Cell study — said that upon becoming infected with the novel coronavirus, the “carbohydrate patterns” on the mothers’ antibodies were altered, decreasing their transfer efficiency.
However, the immune systems of pregnant women were able to compensate for the transfer inefficiency by increasing the total amount of antibodies in their system. The most effective antibodies, which activate “natural killer cells” that destroy the virus, were transferred “preferentially” to the fetus, according to Edlow.
Findings from both studies present questions for future research.
Evan A. Bordt, a postdoctoral fellow at HMS involved in both studies, said it would be important to “keep an eye on” the babies born from mothers infected with Covid-19 during their pregnancy.
According to Edlow, there could be “subtle effects,” such as hyperactivity or learning difficulties, on the neurodevelopment of newborns whose mothers had been infected with Covid-19 in pregnancy, which is true of other viral infections.
Atyeo said these findings may also prove important for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development and research.
“It might be important for when we’re looking at maternal immunization to look to see if the vaccine actually induces antibodies that can transfer across the placenta efficiently,” she said. “And then I think it’s really important to consider the timing of when these mothers are vaccinated.”
Emory University Gynecology and Obstetrics chair Denise J. Jamieson — who was not involved with either study — said the JAMA Network study “certainly raises concern about whether the vaccine is going to be effective in providing neonatal benefit.”
Both Jamieson and Edlow, however, emphasized that these findings do not mean that pregnant women — who are “more likely to have severe disease, more likely to go to the ICU, and even more likely to be intubated, or to die, than women who are their same age that are not pregnant,” according to Edlow — should not be vaccinated.
“Overall, I’m recommending that pregnant women get vaccinated because of the risks to their health,” Jamieson said. “It would be really nice, and an added benefit, if we could also say that it will help protect your baby after birth, but based on this, we can’t.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council reduced the maximum allocation per student under its Career Opportunity Fund to $200 due to higher demand from students than anticipated, according to a UC Finance Committee statement.
Finance Committee Chair Daniella M. Berrospi ’24 created the Career Opportunity Fund to provide first-generation, low-income students with the resources to pay for the expenses of internships — primarily clothing — and other external projects.
The program was absorbed into the funding for Wintersession — the period marking the last 10 days of winter break — to consolidate applications for the different program offerings and simplify the grant distribution process.
According to Eliot House Representative Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22, the UC increased the Wintersession funding from $10,000 to $30,000 to better satisfy student demand. Of this $30,000, roughly half went towards the Career Opportunity Fund.
Still, student demand outsized the UC’s Wintersession budget.
“It was a total of over $230,000 requested compared to a total of $30,000 last year,” Ganesh said. “We couldn’t get any extra money this past semester, but we are looking to get more money for the upcoming semester for these programs,” Ganesh said.
More than 400 students applied to receive a grant from the Career Opportunity Fund, she added.
Though unable to meet the full funding demand, the UC still distributed the allotted $30,000 to interested undergraduates through a random lottery system that granted priority to students on full financial aid.
“It really came down to a weird trade-off between how many students can we fund meaningfully versus for how many students this was a meaningful amount of money,” Ganesh said.
Ganesh and Berrospi said they attribute the rise in demand to better publicizing of Wintersession funding and the pandemic encouraging students to want to seek out internship opportunities.
UC Treasurer Edwin “Eddie” B. Jin ’24 said he will advocate for those who were not able to receive a grant this funding cycle.
“I'm going to try to pursue legislation with other people to approve more funds for the remainder of career opportunity grants, so it's not like we're totally abandoning those people who we didn't roll down to in the first semester,” Jin said.
Ganesh added that the UC will work with other groups in the future to keep up with student demand.
“We’re looking to partner with other groups moving forward. That way we can make sure everyone who needs help gets help,” Ganesh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of Wednesday’s riots at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., nearly 700 Harvard affiliates have petitioned for Harvard’s Institute of Politics to disaffiliate with U.S. Representative Elise M. Stefanik ’06 (R-N.Y.), a supporter of efforts to overturn Electoral College votes in favor of President Donald Trump.
Stefanik, who serves on the IOP's Senior Advisory Committee, announced in a press release Monday that she planned to object to “certain contested electors” during Wednesday’s Electoral College count. The count was suspended when a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, but after the Capitol was secured and Congress reconvened, Stefanik proceeded with her objection to the results.
The petition demands that the IOP remove Stefanik from its Senior Advisory Committee and “immediately sever all other ties with her.”
“We, the undersigned members of the IOP community, unequivocally condemn the attempt of fellow graduate Elise Stefanik ’06 to undermine democracy and our Constitution by improperly challenging the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as President and Vice-President of the United States and enabling violence at our Capitol,” the petition reads.
Megan O. Corrigan ’16, an author of the petition, said that the chaos at the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon inspired her and her co-authors’ calls to remove Stefanik from her IOP position.
“We knew that Representative Stefanik was someone who had a position at Harvard, who was on the Senior Advisory Committee for the IOP, and so we thought let’s try to get her off,” Corrigan said. “This is someone who should not have any legitimacy at this point, and Harvard is lending her legitimacy.”
Corrigan emphasized the “bipartisan nature” of the petition, noting that two former presidents of the Harvard Republican Club had signed it.
Corrigan and petition co-author Jacob R. Carrel ’16 said they were heartened by the reception the petition received among undergraduates.
Nadia R. Douglas ’23 offered to help Carrel share the petition among undergraduates after learning about it in a group chat. She and a friend created a “digestible” post with a statement and accompanying graphics about the petition that they posted on social media.
Douglas said she thinks “some type of reckoning” will result from the petition.
“I believe our actions won’t fall on deaf ears,” she said. “I believe that we will at least be heard and given a chance to speak.”
Menatallah N. “Menat” Bahnasy ’22, president of the IOP, said the process of deciding whether Stefanik is expelled from the IOP has yet to be “fully articulated.”
“There are lots of meetings ongoing today, as well as the coming days, to really flesh out what’s happened and determine what the right next steps are,” she said. “That might be through [Harvard Kennedy School] faculty and staff and deans, or it might be through Harvard University-wide administration. It’s not concrete yet.”
Bahnasy added that she has “no doubt” that the IOP and University administration will consider the petition.
James F. Smith, a spokesperson for the Kennedy School, declined to comment.
Zachary R. Werner ’22 said he supported the removal of Stefanik from her position within the IOP because of her contribution to the “conspiracy theories” that led to Wednesday’s protest.
“I believe this is the first petition I’ve ever signed in my two and a half years at Harvard pretty much for any purpose,” he said. “I’m not for banning people from campus that you disagree with, but the difference here is that Representative Stefanik has engaged and put forth these — there's no other word but — conspiracy theories.”
“I think, especially in light of today’s events, it’s just clear how damaging these conspiracy theories can be,” Werner added.
Jaden D. “J.D.” Deal ’23 also condemned Stefanik’s actions and advocated against giving her a platform within the IOP.
“Students don't need a ‘both sides’ of this issue, and they don't need to hear from somebody that is actively challenging the election results,” he added.
Stefanik, a former Crimson columnist, could not be reached for comment. In a Wednesday statement, she wrote that the rampage on Capitol Hill marked a “tragic day for America.”
“I fully condemn the dangerous violence and destruction that occurred today at the United States Capitol,” Stefanik wrote. “The perpetrators of this un-American violence and destruction must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
A similar open letter urging Harvard to establish “accountability guidelines” for inviting former Trump administration officials to campus was formally sent to University administrators on Wednesday.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton acknowledged that the University had received the open letter, but did not provide further comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 200 students violated Harvard College’s community compact — a list of residential guidelines for students living on campus during Covid-19 — throughout the fall semester, according to an interim report released by the Dean of Students Office Thursday.
The College created the Community Council — a group of students, faculty, and staff members — ahead of the fall semester to help enforce the community compact. As a “non-disciplinary body,” the Community Council members work to review infractions of the community compact and dole out warnings to non-compliant students, though it can send students home from campus housing.
According to the report, 219 students were referred to the Council for violating Covid-19 safety protocols on campus. Of these students, seven were found to have committed no violations while 32 were removed from on-campus housing.
Forty-nine percent of the referrals brought to the Council involved students failing to complete Crimson Clear — the daily coronavirus symptom survey mandated for students living on campus. The second most common violation — 17 percent of the referrals — involved hosting an unauthorized gathering.
Even though the Council handled 219 referrals, a total of 251 concerns were found during the fall semester, as some instances contained multiple violations of the community compact.
The Council took six types of actions in response to alleged violations of the community compact, ranging from a disciplinary warning to removal from campus, per the report.
The most common response to a violation was a warning from a community health lead — a tutor, proctor, or faculty dean — and did not involve a full Council review.
Removal from on-campus housing, which did require formal review from the Council, was the second-most common response. Students who are sent home by the Council are allowed to continue taking classes remotely.
In October 2020, The Crimson reported three freshmen living in Mather House were sent home after hosting an unauthorized indoor gathering with multiple guests.
In an email, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane outlined the role of the Community Council in protecting the health and safety of Harvard affiliates.
“The Community Council’s role is to help uphold students’ commitment to keeping Harvard, and the broader community, safe during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Dane wrote. “The Community Council's work is guided by two values: protecting the health and safety of all members of the College community and preserving the ability of students to learn and teachers to teach."
The College plans to invite up to 3,100 undergraduates to live in residence during the spring semester, including seniors, enrolled juniors, and a select group of underclassmen and petitioning unenrolled juniors. Each student will have to sign the community compact to live on-campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Faculty and researchers at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy said the role of digital platforms in catalyzing the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol Wednesday exposed an acute need for media accountability.
The rioters used digital platforms including Parler, Telegram, and a pro-Trump website named TheDonald, among others, to plan the events Wednesday afternoon, which left four dead and scores arrested.
Following the Capitol storming, both Facebook and Twitter locked President Donald J. Trump’s accounts — with Facebook’s ban lasting at least for the rest of his presidency and Twitter’s for 12 hours. Three of Trump’s tweets marked “repeated and severe violations” of the company’s Civic Integrity policy, according to a post by Twitter Safety.
Nancy R. Gibbs, director of the Shorenstein Center and former editor-in-chief of TIME Magazine, wrote in an email that media-driven misinformation played a significant role in catalyzing Wednesday’s events.
“Millions of Americans sincerely believe that an election was stolen, because they’ve heard this from the sources they trust,” she wrote. “There’s a direct line from that deception to the destruction we saw at the Capitol, where radical factions could fashion themselves as freedom fighters because the President was calling them patriots.”
Others at the Center said the inconsistent regulatory policies of major media companies like Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook made possible the escalation of political discourse to tangible violence. Since the election, Trump has used his social media platforms to amplify his baseless claims of voter fraud.
Gabrielle Lim, a researcher at the Center, said media companies’ recent push to regulate Trump’s rhetoric “comes too little, too late.”
“Trump has broken a lot of the norms and terms of policies prior to this already, and so the question is — why now? Why after massive unrest and violence are the platforms doing something now?” she said. “My personal take on it right now is that it’s more to do with politics and optics than it does with their actual policies.”
Joan Donovan, who serves as the Center’s Research Director, said media companies should have acted swiftly to prevent misinformation about election fraud from spilling into real-world harm.
“These companies should have taken incremental action before we got to this point, to remove people that were pushing election disinformation so that the chorus didn’t get so loud,” she said. “Because there had been no repercussions for so many people, these groups were allowed to continue to lay out the case for insurrection, lay out the case for pulling a coup, storming the Capitol.”
Emily R. Dreyfuss, a senior editor at the Center’s Technology and Social Change Project, expressed frustration with law enforcement officials’ claims that there was no substantiated evidence to predict Wednesday’s pro-Trump rampage.
“This entire event yesterday was planned in the open on social networks that anyone had access to look at. Our team had been reading these posts, we anticipated this. We were not alone — journalists, and researchers, and, frankly, casual observers of social media saw this coming and saw the posts planning it,” she said.
Shorenstein Center senior researcher Robert M. Faris added that research conducted by the Center suggests media in the United States is “not only polarized, but asymmetrically polarized.”
“Compared to media systems on the center and the left — that are grounded in the standards and practices of objective journalism — the right is more partisan,” he said. “It’s the partisan roots of conservative media that drive what we’ve termed the propaganda feedback loop, where political leaders and partisan media and partisan audiences share, amplify, and perpetuate false narratives.”
Natascha Chtena, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Center and editor-in-chief of the Kennedy School’s Misinformation Review, underscored the importance of discussing misinformation in the context of broader societal issues.
“I’m a little concerned that we’re losing sight of the fact that white supremacy, white fragility, and white privilege are also very much at the heart of what’s happening. And that is an issue that goes back way before misinformation was even part of the conversation,” she said.
Miriam T. Aschkenasy, program director for the Center’s Institutional Anti-Racism and Accountability Project, added that the stark contrast between law enforcement’s treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters during the summer’s racial justice protests and Wednesday’s pro-Trump mob sheds light on the persisting issue of systemic racism.
“This is a perfect example of what structural racism looks like, that led us to this moment — one group is peacefully protesting, and they are surrounded by guns and military and treated as less than,” she said. In contrast, she said, law enforcement made a “completely insufficient response” to the pro-Trump mob.
Dreyfuss said it is too early to tell whether Wednesday’s events mark “the end of a very crazy era” or “the beginning of something scarier for the political landscape, the media landscape, and the information landscape.”
“What happened yesterday will be a defining moment for this generation of media creators and observers,” Dreyfuss said. “That’s the question that we are all asking ourselves now. And it remains to be seen in what direction it will go.”
