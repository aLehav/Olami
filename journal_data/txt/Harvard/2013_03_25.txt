After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“So this is where old entertainers go to die,” quips the titular once-famous Vegas magician of Don Scardino’s new film, “The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,”  when he reaches the lowest point in his career. His remark could also  be a fairly accurate, if slightly too harsh, description of the movie  itself. Scardino, known best for his work directing “30 Rock,”  has made a somewhat less than incredible entrance into the movie  industry. “The Incredible Burt Wonderstone” has a strong enough  beginning and ending that almost—but not quite—allow its audience to  overlook the flat and hackneyed jokes that pepper the mediocre middle  portion of the film.
In many ways, “Burt Wonderstone” feels like a redux of the 2001 comedy “Zoolander” in which the two rivals—Burt Wonderstone and Steve Gray—are no longer male models, but rather Las Vegas magicians. Burt Wonderstone (Steve Carrell) begins the film as an  arrogant superstar magician who has been performing the same show for  years with his partner and ex-best friend Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi). When Anton is injured during a performance and Burt’s fame is suddenly eclipsed by that of the up-and-coming street performer Steve Gray (Jim Carrey)—whose  outrageous stunts have garnered him a strong cult following—the Vegas  veteran must fight his way back to the top by himself.
The  opening scenes of the film are undeniably entertaining. An extended  flashback to Burt’s lonesome childhood may come across as unnecessarily  expository, but the jokes are fresh. Carrell and Buscemi seem to be a  perfect comedic duo when they burst onto stage in glitzy, spangled  outfits and begin dancing awkwardly. Burt’s onstage banter with Anton  and his new assistant Jane (Olivia Wilde) is no less amusing. The film takes a decidedly negative turn, however,  with the arrival of Jim Carrey’s character in the narrative.  The edgy,  hippie street performer Steve Gray is such an entirely unappealing  character that it is hard to understand why he poses any threat to Burt  and Anton. Gray’s lines fall flat, and his stunts during the film are,  at best, a sort of masochistic slapstick and at worst just utterly  disgusting and ridiculous. Even his audiences in the film—much,  undoubtedly, like the audience in the theater—seem to be mainly confused  or shocked by his performances, not genuinely impressed. With some  slight plot alterations, Carrey’s character could have been excised from  the script, and the film would not have suffered for it in the least.
The  film struggles along for most of its remainder. Many of the jokes that  were funny when they first appeared—the casino owner’s inability to  remember the age of his son, for example, or Burt’s insistence that  Jane’s name is actually that of his previous assistant—are recycled  numerous times during the film and are unable to rouse the laughs they  previously had. The middle portion of the film is also plagued by short,  jumpy scenes that feel jumbled and disconnected. We cut back and forth  from the rivalry between Burt and Steve Gray, to the budding romance  between Burt and Jane, to Burt and Anton’s struggling friendship, and  finally to the mentorship of Burt by Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin),  the now-elderly magician who had inspired Burt to become a magician as a  child. This failure to focus on or engage with any one particular  relationship in the film makes it difficult to connect with any of the  characters besides Burt, creating the feeling that the script simply has  too much happening all at once.
 The film does, on some level, redeem itself in its final minutes when  Burt, Anton, Rance, and Jane all unite to pull off the one trick that  had always stumped Burt and Anton as children. The trick itself is  hilarious in its absurdity, and the means the magicians use to achieve  it are equally ridiculous. The humor in the final portion of the film is  also pulled off with far more success than during the rest of the film.  When, for example, Wilde’s character pulls a condom out from behind  Burt’s ear and he with a sleight of hand promptly switches the standard  condom with a Magnum XL, it becomes the most successful gag in the film  up to that point. Most importantly, however, the final performance  attempts, but only partially succeeds in, tying together the various  disconnected plot strands.
Midway  through the film, Arkin’s character explains to Burt that when people  watch a magician perform, they “want to think what they’re seeing is  real magic.” An audience watching a film hopes to experience a similar  sense of wonderment and awe, but unfortunately, “The Incredible Burt  Wonderstone” fails to deliver very much movie magic at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
What would happen if a movie studio ripped off the plot of “Taken,” doused it in the sensibilities of the “Saw” franchise, and added some elements of “Psycho” for good measure? Likely something very close to “The Call.” Directed by Brad Anderson, the film never knows exactly to do with itself, drowning itself in its  indecision over being either a hard-hitting, albeit derivative, thriller  or a gruesome, tasteless horror film. By overextending beyond either  genre’s range, “The Call” confuses, and the final result offsets any of  the film’s redeeming qualities.
 
Confident and skilled at her job as a 911 operator, Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) unexpectedly botches a call, leading to the kidnapping and murder of a  young girl, leaving the heroine shaken and emotionally compromised.  Relegated to a teaching role, Turner is sucked back into the 911 call  center when another teenager, Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin), is kidnapped by the same man, Michael Foster (Michael Eklund). What begins is a cat-and-mouse chase as Turner tries to save this girl, as she was unable to do for Foster’s previous victim.
 
The main thing keeping the film afloat is the strong acting and chemistry between Breslin and Berry. Breslin of “Little Miss Sunshine” fame  shows her evolution from a child star to a very respectable actress. In  a twisted way, “The Call” is a coming of age story for Casey, who  transitions from a shrinking violet who is afraid to curse to a  resilient woman hungry for her independence and freedom from her captor.  Breslin is able to pace this development organically through her wide  breadth of emotions, which progress from fear to frustration and  ultimately to hope.
 
“We  are Capricorns. We are fighters,” says Jordan to Casey, succinctly  summing up the the dynamic between the two characters. Through their  interactions with one another, both characters are able to develop in a  smooth, believable fashion. Buzzing beneath their exteriors is a quiet  strength that elevates the characters from simply being victims and  stereotypes. Acting as both a surrogate mother and sister to Casey,  Berry’s Jordan is able to elicit compassion, making the plot line more  palatable to the audience. Although their interaction takes place  primarily through the sonic airways of a prepaid phone as Jordan directs  Casey on how to escape, it is a testament to the actresses’ talent that  they are able to capture the feelings of desperation and mutual  dependence that serves as the film’s emotional backbone. It is ironic,  then, that it is when Berry leaves the confines of her desk and begins  sharing scenes with Breslin that the film falters.
 
The  movie, despite its strong acting, is let down by its final act, which  is devoid of intelligence and in opposition to the rest of the film. The  middle sequence, which takes place primarily on the streets as Casey  attempts to escape the confines of Foster’s car’s trunk, feels like a  longer preview to a much better, smarter film. These scenes seem like  pieces of a more sophisticated thriller, fraught with twists and turns.  The sequence feels confused and frustrated at the sudden momentum break  when Jordan decides to investigate the crime on her own terms and drops  her iPhone down the dark pit in the ground that leads to the almost  comically cliché lair of Foster. What ensue are scenes that would be  more at home in a trashy, low-budget horror film—a scalping,  back-and-forth tussling between Foster and Jordan, and a few gratuitous  displays of gore. This would all be fine if this were the type of film  that was projected in the first hour, but instead the film blindsides  with a sudden shift in tone and pacing.
 
The  pitfalls of the screenplay are further accentuated by Anderson’s uneven  directing. There are some magnificent moments of sleekness and polish  that give a glimpse of a different film that seems to have changed  course during its development. The film opens with the aesthetically  pleasing bird’s-eye view of the city at night. In the background is the  noise of multiple 911 calls that eventually meld into one noise of  static. The result is engaging and draws the audience into the world of a  911 emergency center. Many times, though, Anderson indulges in one too  many freeze frames and long shots towards the end, which feels  incongruous with the first half of the film.
 
In  many ways, “The Call” would be greatly improved by shaving off the last  20 minutes. There is no question that the movie aims to be a  popcorn-munching blockbuster. However, it is instead a strange tango  between a serious drama and gritty horror film that leaves a bad taste  in the mouth and a vague, unsettling feeling of what could have been.

Why don’t we do what we want to do? Last year the Crimson conducted a “Senior Survey” for the Class of 2012, asking students both what they wish they were doing after graduation and what they were actually doing. The graduating students reported a sizable discrepancy between the industries they planned on entering post-Harvard and the ones they wanted to enter. If we momentarily forget the anomalous education sector, a significant plurality of seniors indicated that they would be working in the finance and consulting sectors, while a similar proportion indicated they would rather work in the arts or in public service. This gap was possibly even larger before the financial crisis, since most investment banks have cut back on recruitment in recent years.
It is a startling thought that for every recent Harvard graduate who is in the line of work of his or her preference, there are several who wish they were doing something entirely different. Harvard was supposed to grant us with vast opportunities to pursue our dreams, but maybe this is not to be the case in real life.
Granted, there are powerful forces at work: Economic realities demand that some students lean towards higher-paying jobs in order to pay off loans or to support their families. But this is not true for most students. There are social pressures too—the social prestige of becoming a Wall Street financier or management consultant often exceeds that of other options, at least on a college campus. Lastly, the corporate recruiting system is both alluring and convenient, as on-campus information sessions and exclusive dinners have proved to be powerful in convincing undergrads to work in certain industries.
Despite the risks associated with choosing to work in more unconventional fields, some students still end up doing what they want. Interestingly, the proportion of students at Harvard who claim to want to work in education is equal to the proportion that ends up teaching in schools. Though an outsized proportion of this pool is likely made up by “corps members” for Teach For America, a two-year program with unfortunately high attrition rates, it is nevertheless a good sign. Unfortunately, this certainly does not extend to most students.
Of course, the problem with some students is that they have no idea what they want. Even for those that do, the perceived risks of pursuing it are often too large. A prestigious corporate job with a two or three-year commitment seems to offer a temporary cushion from worrying about employment as well as a background that could potentially jumpstart a successful career.
But what are the downsides to not immediately pursuing one’s passions? For many, the proverbial “golden handcuffs” of having to stay with a particular job to maintain a certain standard of living become oppressive down the line, and it becomes harder to switch industries as one ages. There is a strong possibility that Harvard students are unnecessarily risk averse, as the rewards of doing something one loves are plenty, and there are hidden costs associated with following the crowd. The only way to ensure you end up doing what you wish to do is to start doing that thing now, not after that two-year program, and certainly not after an established career in a totally unrelated field.
Granted, there are definitely students who truly love finance or consulting, and those are the students who should work in these fields. It isn’t unimaginable to think that an aspiring financier or consultant has had his dreams sidelined by a less-motivated (but ostensibly more qualified) student who took his spot at a firm. These tragedies are perhaps the most unfortunate.
To the students who simply don’t know what they want: Harvard has more resources available to helping you find what you love than potentially any other educational institution in the world. There are plenty of classes, student organizations, job opportunities, and Harvard-funded events that can help. There are alumni who have found success (and more importantly, happiness) in careers that may seem unconventional or strange to the current student or newly minted graduate. An open mind goes a long way in self-discovery.
High school students newly admitted to Harvard often hear that “Harvard opens doors.” This is often true, as the network of Harvard alumni is extraordinary, and the brand name isn’t bad either. This means that we should be able to take more risks than the average person while maintaining a sense of security in our careers. Despite the ocean of possibility we feel when we first receive that acceptance letter, the culture here can perpetuate a convergence of career goals informed by mass risk aversion. The truth is, you have a choice of doors that Harvard can help open, and the choice should be entirely yours. Do what you want, and start early.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a number of years, KIPP—the Knowledge Is Power Program—has been catching the nation’s attention as the new and trendy educational model: the charter school that worked. Located in 20 states spread across the United States, KIPP schools promote a program of rigorous academic discipline, extended school hours, and an emphasis on character development. KIPP students are primarily from underprivileged backgrounds—the KIPP website boasts that “over 87 percent of our students are from low-income families and eligible for the federal free or reduced-price meals program, and 95 percent are African American or Latino.” Their aim is to prepare their students to overcome societal disadvantage to reach and succeed in college. And it seems to be working: KIPP students consistently score better on standardized tests than students from surrounding schools, and over 80 percent of students who completed 8th grade at KIPP have later gone on to college.
Last month, a comprehensive Mathematica study came out analyzing the effectiveness of the KIPP approach to teaching, and found it to be just as, if not more, effective than previously believed. The study analyzed data and practices from 43 schools across the country and found that after three years, KIPP students were an average of 11 months ahead of surrounding schools in math, and an average of eight months ahead in reading. They spent an average of 35-53 more minutes on homework and scored higher on tests measuring “higher-order thinking.” The study also served to silence some critics who remained unconvinced by Mathematica’s 2010 study, or who believed that low-scoring students frequently left and were replaced by high-achieving students. The Mathematica data seems clear: KIPP really is more effective. So how can we use this to help more underprivileged children in America?
Part of what makes KIPP such a difficult model to reproduce is that it combines a number of factors, from longer school hours to parent commitment contracts. Many of the components of the KIPP philosophy are not implementable in public schools—longer school hours, for example, mean more work hours for teachers, which is opposed by certain teachers’ unions. Also, there is the matter of motivation: The KIPP only works with students and families who apply. Students sign contracts to uphold the expectations of the school, and parents sign contracts to provide homework help and generally support their children’s education. Enforcing academic rigor on unwilling students does not seem like a practical plan, and enforcing it without ensuring a supportive home environment seems downright unfair. Even if public schools were to somehow ensure student and parent participation, implementing these kinds of large-scale educational reforms could be a costly proposition, and public schools do not have a foundation like the KIPP Foundation to fund these changes. It seems that mimicking the entire KIPP curriculum is an unrealistic plan.
However, the alternative—isolating and implementing the most important factors—is a near impossible task. So, up until recently, this is as far as the topic could be pursued. But the recent Mathematica study may reopen the debate. Though longer school hours seemed a key part of the KIPP curriculum, “average impacts on student achievement are smaller in KIPP schools with a particularly extended school day.” The study states that the most likely reason for this is focus of time—additional hours are often spent on “non-core academic activities.” Thus, lengthening school days may not be necessary to make academic curricula more effective, and restructuring class time is certainly a more manageable goal.
Perhaps one of the most important ways in which KIPP schools differ from most public schools is in terms of school culture. The KIPP philosophy holds good character to be a vital component of academic success, and accordingly KIPP schools foster a culture in which honesty is valued as highly as grades are. Though difficult to analyze empirically, this could be the key factor boosting student achievement; Education Week’s article analyzing the report states, “No other school climate factors yielded a statistically significant correlation with academic performance.” It is also arguably in line with identity economics—changing school identity affects the way students perceive their own identities, which in turn influences their decisions (and performance) later in life. Increasing student achievement in public schools may be as simple as changing they way they relate to it.
KIPP schools perform a great social service by essentially enabling the American dream: providing students from poor and minority background with the skills to succeed. Yet there are many students who could greatly benefit from the help of programs like KIPP, but to whom this option is not available. Part of KIPP’s vision is that “one day, all public schools will help children develop the knowledge, skills, character, and habits necessary to achieve their dreams while making the world a better place.” It strives to be a model for public schools nationwide, and is succeeding: their example is proof that equalizing racial and socioeconomic achievement gaps is a feasible goal. Given the results of the 2013 study, it is time we started implementing its methods, and hopefully benefiting from its results.

The Yard is quiet, the flash mobs and mascots are gone, and the apparel is safely tucked away in drawers. As always, Housing Day was raucous and rollicking, but it wasn’t perfect. So how can we do better next year?
 Because Housing Day falls before spring break and squarely in the middle of the semester, it is inevitable that midterms and papers will weasel their way into what should be a time of merriment. This seemed to be particularly true this year, as many freshmen eschewed the Houses’ dinners, parties, and welcome events to hit the books and pound out the pages. That speaks to a typical predicament on this campus: the arduous task of balancing work, fun, and sleep. 
 Yet it also reflects a failure to create community. Beyond Harvard-Yale—and excepting the recent historic men’s basketball run—Housing Day is one of only times this college, its social life diffuse as it is, comes together in a celebration of school spirit and tradition. It is the first time that many freshmen are openly and wholeheartedly embraced by the Houses’ scene, upperclassmen throwing parties for their new Housemates. The day is also singular in that the early interactions it fosters make Houses, well, Houses, and not mere assortments of blocking groups. That students would be kept away from the revelry by a pre-spring break wave of tests and essay deadlines is lamentable. Luckily, though, it is preventable. In the future, professors and instructors should dialogue with students about alternative exam days and due dates. Additionally, the administration must communicate to faculty the importance of this occasion for campus community.
 We also urge the College to clarify its policies regarding Housing Day Eve. The night before freshmen receive their housing assignments, this is—and has been for at least several years—a period of racuous festivity. Customarily, first-years participate in the River Run ritual, which involves consuming alcohol in the courtyards of several Houses and lighting paper boats on fire in the Charles River. This year, the College banned freshmen from the Houses on Housing Day Eve and alerted students that there would be an increased police presence that night. This blanket prohibition was not made clear to all upperclassmen, and it left many students scratching their heads as to what behavior was permissible. 
In 2014, after discussion with the freshmen and upperclassmen communities, it would be wise for the administration to adopt better publicized and less ad hoc Housing Day Eve regulations. Through exam policy as well as clear communication, it is important that we communicate openly about how the crucial Housing Day tradition should be observed.

Tabloid, middle-aged, and each the same as the next, network crime shows are exactly the kind of thing one wouldn’t want to bring up in young, polite company. An occasional exception is Dick Wolf’s long-running Law & Order: SVU, which comes explicitly labeled as a show about “sexually-based offenses” and the “elite squad” that investigates them—but when it comes down to it, the model of the ready-made one-hour murder plot quickly runs up against diminishing marginal returns.
Fourteen seasons in, fatal patterns come into relief. Suspects under interrogation before minute 30 are never guilty; if the victim is a child, Detective Stabler will probably throttle someone against a wall. Though eminently watchable, SVU is at its core like all TV crime simulations: contrived, artless, grasping for straws.
Luckily enough for avid crime-watchers, there exists a parallel phenomenon out there on the higher channels, full of art and never desperate for original material: the true crime show. However, because of such feely things as decency and fear of the uncanny, one is even less likely to hear about true crime shows from the young, highbrow crowd. But as a semi-regular consumer of such riveting titles as Cold Case Files, The New Detectives, and City Confidential for the last decade, I’m surprised that their viewership remains largely limited to middle-aged women in the heartland.
My first taste of the genre is preserved in a single memory, suspended in the amber of middle childhood and without specific context: the reenactment of an Elvis-masked man breaking into a suburban house, silencing his shotgun blasts with a bright-red pizza delivery box warmer. And here is the essence of the true crime show’s art: unburdened by the process of inventing a story anew for each production, producers get to focus on the business of making harrowing images that stick in the mind better than anything high-budget.
In this genre, which knew its pre-rerun peak between 1999 and 2006, every episode is a knowing cascade of potential nightmare frames. To be sure, the material makes short work of the task of believability: From babies in boxes to prom queens slain on their way back from the dance, each story deals with real lives snuffed out, real gruesome details, and real loved ones to complete the documentary circle with tearful narration.
But the art of the true crime show is not made by verisimilitude alone. As for anything moving and yet tasteful, there exists a careful method to crafting just the right true crime segment, as defined chiefly by its images. When the following parts are assembled correctly, they can haunt like nothing else on cable TV—and for far cheaper, too:
Narration: The true crime show presents itself as a documentary of sorts. And whether it’s Bill Kurtis’ dry tones or Paul Winfield’s frighteningly cool affect, narration makes the mood and frames the scenes. There is no banter, only urgency.
Music: Unlike the breezy themes of network shows, true crime music is always dark, dissonant, and evocative of murder—never hopeful. Witness the gloomy, autumnal bars that usher in each scene of Cold Case Files, or the crescendo-filled horror show that opens The New Detectives. During particularly disturbing scenes, the score turns warped and nauseous, subtly beckoning listeners to vomit.
Period: While one will find some cases from as early as the mid-seventies and as late as the early aughts, true crime shows give the impression that creepiness was the exclusive province of 1986 to 1993—complete with an associated web of hairstyles and fashions.
Mise-en-scene: Nothing can explain why such a decisive majority of televised murder cases take place in either the Upper Midwest or California, and principally in the suburbs. New York and Miami, for all their popularity in network crime shows, are scarcely to be seen.
Demographics: See JonBenet Ramsey, Elizabeth Smart, Laci Peterson, etc. Our true crime shows don’t skip a beat: lamentably, a solid three-quarters of victims are female, at least nine in 10 are white. And besides the odd hooker episode, the overwhelming balance are middle-class and well-bred, out of trouble and victims of pure, cruel circumstance.
The product is a visceral, thoughtful, and gritty journey—about as close as one would ever like to get to violent crime for 30 to 60 minutes. Moreover, shorn of the need to suspend disbelief, the true crime watching experience is exceptionally easy: just sit back, enter a realm of dates and places, and be taken in by the images.
And if you aren’t normally game for on-air crime, make an exception one of these nights for one of the aforementioned programs. If my analysis is correct, you’ll be struck by just how much art there is to be found in this oft-dismissed genre. At the very least, you won’t be able to sleep soundly for the next few evenings.

The overwhelming majority of very high-achieving, low-income students choose not to apply to the most selective colleges in the nation, according to a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research that will be published in the spring 2013 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity.
The analysis, authored by education researchers Caroline M. Hoxby ’88, an economics professor at Stanford, and Christopher N. Avery ’88, professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, found that only 34 percent of high-achieving high school seniors from the bottom quartile of the income distribution went on to attend one of the country’s highly-ranked selective schools.
In contrast, students from high-income backgrounds with the same grades and test scores—a grade point average of at least an A- and scores at or above the 90th percentile in the ACT or SAT I—were much more likely to apply to selective colleges where average student achievement was close to their own. For high-achieving students coming from the top quartile of income, 78 percent ended up at a highly-selective college. This disparity persists despite the fact that “high-achieving, low-income students who do apply to selective institutions are admitted and graduate at high rates,” the study stated.
Hoxby and Avery noted that current outreach attempts made by selective colleges may be insufficient to attract high-achieving, low-income applicants. According to the study, these students are “very unlikely to encounter a teacher, counselor or neighbor who attended a selective college.” The authors also found that such students are often geographically dispersed, making it difficult for admissions officers to visit their schools in person.
According to Bari Norman, former admissions counselor and current president of Expert Admissions, the study highlights the fact that even schools like Harvard “have work to do” to bring in more undergraduates from under-privileged backgrounds.
But Norman added that Harvard’s financial resources are a major factor allowing the school to reach out to a broader range of students in ways that “most other colleges just can’t.”
“It does require a tremendous amount of financial commitment to find these people and keep them there,”  Norman said. “I think it’s the responsibility of colleges not only to find these students, but to have the proper financial support to keep them there.”
The new study, which has received widespread attention, suggests that the lack of higher education opportunities for high-achieving, low-income students is more acute than previously believed. “Colleges are missing the mark in looking more exclusively on race and not on income and socioeconomic status,” Norman said. “I’m glad the conversation is becoming a national one.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After discussing virtual education earlier in the week, University President Drew G. Faust wrapped up her trip to Asia Friday on the note of female empowerment in a speech at Ewha Womans University—the largest women’s educational institution in the world—in Seoul, South Korea.
Seoul was the second of two stops on the five-day trip, which began on Monday in Hong Kong. In both cities, Faust attended events with several hundred alumni, as well as meetings with students and leaders in business and education.
In Seoul, where Faust was honored as a distinguished fellow at Ewha, she advocated for increased educational opportunities for women, noting the success of Ewha alumni as well as her own experience at Bryn Mawr, a women’s liberal arts college in Pennsylvania.
“Imagining the world without female achievements is increasingly difficult, in every field,” Faust said, according to her prepared remarks. “And yet much of this talent goes untapped.”
She said that educating women is not only morally and economically imperative but also “transformative.”
“When education becomes too focused on immediate measurable outcomes, on grades and awards, or when it becomes merely a path to money or prestige, we risk forgetting the inherent value of learning and of our broader aspirations,” Faust said. “Educated women change not just their own lives, and work not just for their own success, but for the world. We see countless examples.”
That transformation allows young women to aspire to leadership in their own fields, Faust said, using her own path to becoming Harvard’s first female president as an example.
“As I crossed the green at Bryn Mawr as an undergraduate, I had no inkling I would one day be a university president,” Faust said. “But the idea of a female leader seemed natural to me, because of all the women before me who had dared to lead.”
While in Seoul, Faust also held a question-and-answer session with more than 300 Harvard alumni and met with Korean educational leaders.
Her schedule in Hong Kong included similar events with alumni and others, as well as a discussion on edX, the virtual education initiative launched by Harvard and MIT last May.
The trip was comparable to Faust’s visits to India in January 2012 and China and Japan in March 2010. During these visits, Faust worked to build and reinforce ties to alumni and other leaders in Asia while also exploring the future of education, and in particular its use of technology, on an international scale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With options at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health as well as undergraduate courses and extracurricular organizations, the opportunities for research available to students of the life sciences at Harvard make the first hurdle to involvement not “if” but “how” to begin. To address this obstacle facing concentrators, the Life Sciences cluster of nine concentrations released its first official Student Handbook for Undergraduates in Life Sciences Research this semester.
Co-authored by life sciences undergraduate research adviser Ann B. Georgi and assistant director of undergraduate studies in Molecular and Cellular Biology Thomas Torello, the handbook was written as a companion to a faculty guidebook for advising undergraduate research. The student guide answers questions about how to begin research, find funding, and identify relevant projects.
“The student handbook answers a lot of the questions students come to us with when they’re looking for research,” Georgi said.
The life sciences cluster, which includes biomedical engineering, chemistry, chemical and physical biology, human developmental and regenerative biology, human evolutionary biology, MCB, neurobiology, organismic and evolutionary biology, and social and cognitive neurosciences, has grown to include almost 1,000 undergraduate concentrators. Interest in research has mounted at a similar pace, bringing with it a deluge of questions about advising, funding, and laboratory opportunities.
“No matter what you end up doing in life, [research] is what science is all about,” said Robert A. Lue, director of life sciences education.
A panel of representatives from each of the concentrations, led by Georgi and Torello, identified the key themes amongst student concerns and compiled the handbook as a centralized “roadmap to the life sciences,” said Sujata K. Bhatia, assistant director of undergraduate studies for Biomedical Engineering.
“Research gets at one of our core learning objectives for all of the life sciences concentrations,” Bhatia said. “It is important for students to be able to solve open-ended problems and generate new knowledge like they do in labs.”
Bhatia added that centralizing research resources in this handbook is also a means of emphasizing the “cluster” and demonstrates the unity of all the life sciences. Most of the nine life sciences concentrations require at least a semester of research experience from their students, but the handbook also addresses ways non-science concentrators can join projects and labs.
“We feel very good that any student, even outside the Life Sciences, who wants to have a lab experience will have one,” Torello said.
The guide will be printed this week but can also be found online, where it will continue to be updated as new questions and concerns arise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students making preparations to return to Cambridge after a week of extended relaxation and relatively warm weather found their plans thwarted this weekend by an unexpected snowstorm that struck the United States Midwest and Plains regions, depositing more than 10 inches of snow in some states and delaying flights across the country.
National Weather Service reports indicate that parts of Colorado and northwest Kansas were blanketed in approximately 10 to 15 inches of snow within hours of the storm’s arrival around midnight on Saturday. Southwestern Nebraska was also heavily affected, and the storm dumped seven to nine inches from eastern Kansas into central Missouri before moving on to St. Louis, western Illinois, and Ohio on Sunday. Forecasters expected the storm system to deposit eight to 10 inches in St. Louis, six to 10 in Illinois, and five to nine in Ohio by Sunday night.
Storm-related accidents, poor visibility and other dangerous weather conditions forced the closure of many roads and highways, including the I-70 from Denver to Colby, Kansas.
In addition, 442 flights were canceled and 6,579 were delayed nationwide as of 9 p.m. on Sunday, according to flightstats.com. Seven of the canceled and 113 of the delayed flights were scheduled to land at Logan International Airport in Boston.
With the numerous cancellations and delays, many Harvard students were forced to modify their plans for arrival on campus before the start of classes.
“Both of my roommates are on a flight back right now,” said Amy Z. Chen ’14 at 10 p.m. on Sunday. Chen’s roommate Kristin I. Barclay ’14 experienced at least three hours of continuous delays before boarding a flight from Minneapolis to Boston on Sunday night, according to Chen.
Forrest S. Brown ’15, who returned to campus from the St. Louis area on Sunday, reached Boston 12 hours after his original arrival time.
“While I’m devastated to [have missed] Sunday night brain break, I’m more worried about the increasing frequency of extreme and off-season weather events,” he said.
The storm may have altered many travel plans, but it did not change the NCAA men’s basketball tournament schedule. The University of Kansas Jayhawks defeated the University of North Carolina Tar Heels in a 70-58 victory in Kansas City, Mo., on Saturday.
The storm is expected to weaken as it travels eastward late Sunday night, with predicted total snow accumulation in Pennsylvania between three and eight inches. Before it departs off the coast of New Jersey on Monday night, the system could drop one to three inches in southern New York and New Jersey.

Andrew M. Watkins ’11, the former Harvard Quiz Bowl player accused of illicitly viewing game questions in advance of multiple national championship matches, told The Crimson Sunday that he did not cheat in any academic competition. Speaking in a phone interview, Watkins acknowledged that he had repeatedly opened a web page that offered access to college-level tournament questions, but said that he did not read the questions or use them to help his team win games.
“I had no intention to—and functionally speaking did not—benefit from the content of the questions in any way,” Watkins said. “A website containing question content was loaded. At no point did I read the questions therein.”
He declined to elaborate on his motivations for accessing the page, and would not say why he opened it repeatedly before important games.
On March 20, National Academic Quiz Tournaments, LLC, revoked the Harvard Quiz Bowl team’s victories in four championship matches played between 2009 and 2011 based on an investigation of Watkins’s actions. According to an announcement posted on NAQT’s website, an audit of the company’s server logs showed that Watkins had repeatedly accessed a web page that displayed the first 40 characters of questions that were later used in the same national tournaments in which he subsequently competed.
At the time, Watkins had partial access to the server used to store tournament materials because he was paid by NAQT to write questions for the company’s high school tournaments. However, a security flaw enabled him to open a page that displayed questions written for the collegiate tournaments in which he played.
NAQT’s announcement stated that while the company “has neither direct nor statistical evidence” that Watkins used his prior access to game questions in order to cheat, “the mere possession of it goes against competitors’ expectations of fair play.”
And NAQT President Robert Hentzel said that Watkins, an NAQT contributor since 2009, should have quickly realized that his access to college-level questions was compromising.
“It was clearly marked, and anyone who plays Quiz Bowl would know, “Oh, I’m going to play on those questions, I need to stop looking immediately,’” Hentzel said.
Despite the absence of definitive evidence that Watkins’s visits to the errant page improved his game performance, a number of Watkin’s former competitors said they grew skeptical of his Quiz Bowl prowess at the tournaments for which he had advance access to questions.
“He just did so astoundingly well against some of the greatest science players of all time, beating them in their specialty categories over and over again,” said Andrew Hart, a law school student who played on the University of Minnesota team that Harvard beat in the 2011 championship game. “I think people were suspicious,” he added.
Matthew Weiner, a Quiz Bowl organizer who considers himself an “unofficial adviser” to the Virginia Commonwealth University team that Harvard competed against during Watkins’s time on the team, said that several VCU players raised concerns about Watkins’s access to game questions after the 2010 tournament.
Hentzel confirmed that NAQT responded to complaints made after that tournament with an internal investigation, but said that the review did not uncover anything suspicious at the time.
“[Watkins] was a very good player, but he wasn’t so good that he was really standing out from everybody else,” Hentzel said.
The following year, Harvard became the first all-undergraduate team in NAQT history to win a Division I title in the Intercollegiate Championship Tournament, a prize typically won by teams that are at least partially composed of more experienced graduate students. A few weeks later, Harvard’s team competed in a tournament organized by another organization, the Academic Competition Federation, but failed to finish in the top five.
This raised eyebrows for Weiner and other members of the NAQT community, who noted that Watkins was dramatically less competitive in non-NAQT tournaments.
“His performance dropped precipitously,” Weiner said.
Theodore J. Gioia ’12, a member of Harvard’s 2011 team, said that a variety of factors contributed to the Crimson’s disappointing showing in the Academic Competition Federation tournament. However, he said that the drop-off in Watkins’s performance was, for him, particularly noticeable. “That really fueled the rumors that were circulating,” he said.
Watkins, who has also been barred from writing and editing questions for NAQT, characterized NAQT’s penalties as understandable.
“There’s no question that it was not a wise decision,” said Watkins, who is now a second-year graduate student studying chemistry at New York University. “With better foresight, hindsight, what have you, I wouldn’t have done it.”

Pomona College president David W. Oxtoby ’72 will take the helm of Harvard’s Board of Overseers for the 2013-2014 academic year as the governing body's new president, the University announced in a press release Monday.
Oxtoby will be joined at the head of the Board by celebrated concert violinist Lynn W. Chang ’75, who has been named vice chair of the Board's executive committee.
The Board of Overseers is the second highest of Harvard’s two governing bodies, below the Harvard Corporation. It comprises 30 members elected by alumni to advise University leaders, conduct reviews of schools and departments, and weigh in on certain actions of the Corporation.
 
Both Oxtoby and Chang will assume their roles as they enter the final year of their six-year terms on the Board following Commencement.
 
“David Oxtoby and Lynn Chang are two distinguished educators who bring invaluable and complementary perspectives to the work of the Overseers,” University President Drew G. Faust said in the press release. “We will be fortunate to have them leading the board next year and to continue benefiting from their insight and guidance.”
 
As an Overseer, Oxtoby sits on several committees, including the institutional policy committee and the committee on natural and applied sciences. He named House renewal, the upcoming launch of the capital campaign, and the impact of sequestration on University funding as a few of the many issues that the Board will have to tackle in the coming year.
 
“It’s a great honor to be invited to serve,” said Oxtoby, who served as a divisional dean at the University of Chicago before becoming president of Pomona in 2003, where he is also a chemistry professor.
 
Chang, who teaches at several institutions including the New England Conservatory and Boston University, also called the position an honor.
 
Noting that it is not typical for an Overseer to be a musician, he said he hopes to use his new role to raise interest in the arts as a field of study and potential career path at Harvard.
 
“My hope—which is a dream—is that there will actually be a performing arts component to Gen Ed,” he said.
 
Chang has performed all over the world as a member of the Boston Chamber Music Society and is known for his collaborations with his old college friends Yo-Yo Ma ’76 and Richard J. Kogan ’77.
 
Both of the incoming leaders cited collaboration among Harvard’s schools as a priority for the Board, and by extension, the University.
 
“Harvard is a huge institution.... It’s just humongously spread out,” Chang said, calling interdisciplinary collaboration across Harvard’s schools a goal of many of its affiliates.
 
Oxtoby and Chang will succeed the Board’s current president and executive committee vice-chair, Carnegie Institution for Science president Richard A. Meserve and film producer Lucy Fisher ’71, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ten teams of finalists have been chosen from an initial pool of 127 applications for the 2013 President’s Challenge, a University-wide competition meant to encourage social innovation, Harvard announced in a press release Monday.
Each team that applied to the program proposed an idea in social entrepreneurship in one of five “issue areas”: learning, energy and the environment, health, disaster preparation and relief, and the arts. The finalists’ proposals span a variety of disciplines, ranging from a program to encourage blind youth to achieve their career goals to an artistic production focused on genetics and health.
The 10 teams of finalists will each receive $5,000, the guidance of an expert mentor, and space at the Harvard Innovation Lab to continue the development of their projects—a set of resources that finalists agreed would be crucial towards their success.
Each team of finalists will present their projects on May 6. Near the end of that month, the University will announce a winner, who will split $100,000 in prize money with up to three other teams.
Harvard Law School student John R. Bennett, a leader of one of the finalist teams, spearheaded the creation of Zen Way Inc., which plans to “destroy the [standardized test] book market.” The team's tool, which operates using an online algorithm that tells users what they need to study most, provides a virtual platform for students to access test prep materials.
Bennett said he and his team felt validated when they received news that they were among the finalists. While Zen Way Inc. has already developed a product for the LSAT, Bennett said his team plans to use the President’s Challenge prize money towards developing a version for the SAT.
“For what we need to do next, we need some serious financing,” Bennett said.
Harvard School of Dental Medicine student Gino Inverso, another leader of a finalist team, also said he was pleased by the judges' decision. Inverso’s team is developing a mobile app called Healio that will allow doctors to remotely follow their patients’ healing processes through time-lapse images.
Inverso said the benefits the finalists receive will allow his group to scale up and begin testing designs.
“The I-Lab has been the answer to entrepreneurs at Harvard who want to improve ideas and bring them to the market,” he said.
According to I-Lab Director Gordon S. Jones, it is the multidisciplinary nature of the issue areas that makes the President’s Challenge so compatible with the I-Lab’s commitment to cooperation across disciplines and University schools.
For Jones, the announcement of the finalists is the beginning of a new stage of development for each team.
“I’m excited about the 10 [finalists], and I’m anticipating being wowed by them come May,” Jones said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences affiliates shared their views on the design of SEAS’ new Allston campus with architectural consultants at an open house event Monday afternoon in the Maxwell Dworkin lobby.
Representatives from the firms Shepley Bulfinch and Jacobs Consultancy gathered feedback on SEAS’ teaching, research, and space needs, which will be integrated into a campus plan.
The majority of SEAS is slated to moved to Harvard’s Allston campus in as few as five years. Construction in Allston is slated to begin in 2014.
“What we are trying to do is get input on the psychology of the space,” said Fawwaz Habbal, SEAS executive dean for education and research. “Creativity…requires the right environment.”
Weeks after many SEAS professors responded negatively to the University’s February 5 announcement of the move, affiliates continued to express concerns about the relocation.
Many attendees expressed their criticism through Post-It note responses to the question “What is your vision for SEAS’ future?” The notes were displayed on a wall.
“Interdisciplinary work is our purpose. Moving will kill this,” one note read.
“As staff I feel poorly represented in this process,” read another.
Computer science professor Stuart M. Shieber ’81 said he felt the open house provided an effective forum to express concerns about the design process. He added that administrators should continue to hold meetings for members to give feedback.
“I wouldn’t be under any illusions that one meeting is going to answer all the tremendous, difficult issues that have to get resolved,” Shieber said . “To my mind, the big issue in designing the new development in Allston...is how to build a sense of true community among all the people who will be located there.”
Max Wang ’13, a computer science concentrator, said that the distance to the Allston campus might inhibit many students from taking courses.
“If SEAS can’t make it very compelling for people to make the trek across the river, people aren’t going to show up to class,” Wang said.
Executive Dean for Administration G. Timothy Bowman said that, while details about the utilization of the Allston campus had not yet been decided, his “guess” was that SEAS classes would eventually be held on both sides of the river.
“I could see, for example, more of the design lab and engineering lab coursework will be done in Allston, and maybe some classroom teaching as well, but there will still continue to be some classroom teaching that’s done in Cambridge,” he said.
Bowman also said that he hoped the SEAS Allston campus would develop into a “college student hub” for students coming from the iLab and Harvard’s athletic facilities.
“We want it to be a destination that students, faculty, and the University community want to go to, even if they don’t have a class,” Bowman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard wrestling team’s co-captains wrapped up their collegiate careers Friday with early-round exits as three Crimson grapplers competed at the NCAA Championships in Des Moines, Iowa. Seniors Walter Peppelman (157 lbs.) and Steven Keith (141 lbs.) finished outside the top eight in their respective weight classes with consolation-round losses on day two of the three-day event.
“It’s not the way that you’d want to end your career,” Peppelman said. “It kind of hit Steven and me real hard, but we’ve both been blessed to have had wonderful careers at Harvard.”
Sophomore 197-pounder James Fox also finished off of the podium with first-round and consolation losses on day one. Harvard tied for 41st in the 66-school field with four points, as Penn State picked up its third straight team title.
“It was disappointing. We didn’t wrestle our best,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “I think they fought hard, but things didn’t go our way.”
Ohio University redshirt freshman Spartak Chino upset the 11th-seeded Peppelman with a pin just over a minute into the first-round match of the 157-lb. bracket on Thursday.
“You never want to drop your first match; it’s obviously a terrible place to be,” Peppelman said. “I made a mistake early on and failed to adjust.”
It was the second time in two years that Peppelman had dropped his first-round NCAA Championship match. Last year, the three-time Crimson captain managed to battle his way onto the podium after a first-round loss with an eighth-place finish.
But with his back against the wall, Peppelman could not muster similar heroics. The senior fell the next morning to fifth-seeded Clarion All-American James Fleming, 9-0, after winning a 3-1 decision over Columbia senior Jake O’Hara Thursday afternoon.
“My focus coming into the last match was good. I just ran into a roadblock and didn’t achieve my goal,” Peppelman said.
The result was Peppelman’s lowest finish of his three career NCAA Championship appearances. The two-time All-American had finished eighth in the 157-lb. division in both his sophomore and junior seasons. He nevertheless ends his collegiate career as one of the most successful wrestlers in Harvard program history. Peppelman’s 110 career wins rank sixth on the Crimson all-time list. His 31 career falls rank third.
Keith, who sits just behind Peppelman on Harvard’s all-time list with 105 career wins, also earned his spot among Harvard’s top wrestlers with an eighth-place finish at last year’s NCAA Championships. This weekend, the senior All-American went 2-2 wrestling from an unseeded bid.
“Steven wrestled awesome last year at the NCAA tournament and really fought to get on that platform…. That was a huge accomplishment. This year, I think both [Keith and Peppelman] have had some ups and downs. It’s difficult to go into this tournament as an unseeded wrestler.”
Keith opened the tournament on Thursday morning with a fall over Oklahoma State sophomore Julian Feikert 39 seconds into the second period. In the afternoon, the senior dropped a 7-3 decision in the next round to No. 1 seed and eventual third-place finisher Hunter Stieber of Ohio State.
In the wrestleback, Keith won an 8-3 decision over Penn State senior Bryan Pearsall on Friday morning before falling to eighth-seeded redshirt sophomore Nick Dardanes of Minnesota, 7-4.
While NCAAs will likely be Peppelman’s last competition, Keith plans to compete past college.
Fox left Des Moines winless in the 197-lb. bracket. The sophomore is still looking for his first NCAA Championship bout victory after two invites.
“I don’t think [Fox] knows how good he really is,” Weiss said. “Now that he’s been on the mat his freshman and sophomore year, he’s got to figure out where he wants to be on that platform.”
Fox dropped his first round match to Ohio University redshirt freshman Phillip Wellington, 9-4, before falling to Iowa freshman Nathan Burak in the consolation bracket, 4-0.
Weiss is pleased with what his squad accomplished this year.
“I think the season was really good. We really came together,” Weiss said. “We’re a heavily freshman and sophomore team, which is exciting, and we’ve developed some depth.”
The Crimson will be joined by a top-20 recruiting class. Peppelman believes that Harvard will respond to the gaps that he and Keith will leave.
“I think we’re ready to go. We have a young team, we have a successful team. We’re bringing in guys who are great, top recruits—hard workers, great wrestlers, smart kids,” Peppelman said. “I think the future is really bright for Harvard wrestling. This was one little dark spot along the way, but there is going to be a lot of success to come in the future.”

There are a few indelible images from the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 68-62 victory over New Mexico—its first NCAA tournament win and a victory decades in the making. Sophomore Wesley Saunders’s ear-to-ear smile. Freshman Siyani Chambers bouncing the ball high off the hardwood and throwing his hands into the air in celebration. Coach Tommy Amaker bowing to the Harvard fan section, thanking them for their support.
Since the creation of the Ivy League in 1954, Harvard has sent more men to the Oval Office than teams to the NCAA tournament. The Crimson’s back-to-back appearances in 2012 and 2013 were its first ever repeat performances in the NCAA tournament. Its win over New Mexico was Harvard’s first over an Associated Press Top 10 team.
And although Harvard’s storybook season came to a close Saturday night with a blowout loss against Arizona in the third-round of the NCAA Tournament, the victory against New Mexico at Salt Lake City’s EnergySolutions Arena marks the latest in a series of firsts for a team and a program on the rise.
“It’s unbelievable,” Webster said after the New Mexico game. “We wanted to put everything in it and believed in it, but this is as good as it gets right now… This right here is the number one moment of my basketball career by far.”
But at the beginning of the season, earning a spot in the tournament at all, let alone a victory, seemed improbable following a series of setbacks and changes to last year’s roster. In addition to the graduation of Oliver McNally ’12 and Keith Wright ’12 and withdrawals of co-captains Brandyn Curry and Kyle Casey in the wake of the Government 1310 scandal, Harvard lost backup point guard Corbin Miller when Miller left for his mission trip for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
In their void, a number of young stars arose for the Crimson. Saunders, who led the team with 18 points and played 39 of 40 minutes in the victory over New Mexico, was one of them. Another was Chambers, who played all 40 minutes and added five points and seven assists, including a crucial jumper with 2:18 left that put the team up eight points. New Mexico was never closer than four points the rest of the way.
The Crimson had four players in double figures in the victory and sunk 52 percent of its shots from the field and 44 percent from three-point range.
“I thought we played a really good 40 minutes,” Amaker said. “It’s been a tremendous season for our program, being Ivy champions for the third year in a row and getting the first postseason win in the history of the program, and to do it in this fashion, on this stage against an outstanding team. I can’t say enough about how good this team is… It means the world to us, a significant moment for us to be in this position.”
After Thursday’s victory over the Lobos, the Crimson fell on Saturday in its third-round matchup to the Arizona Wildcats, 74-51. Unlike against the Lobos, when the Crimson began on a 7-2 run and did not trail in the first half, Harvard fell down 17-2 seven minutes into the game against the Wildcats. Arizona was up by 21 after 14 minutes of play.
On defense, the Wildcats suffocated Saunders and junior Laurent Rivard—who combined for 35 points against New Mexico—and held them to only 11 points on two for 17 shooting. Arizona senior Mark Lyons scored 27 points and the Wildcats shot 55 percent from the field and 60 percent from the line.
“They pounced on us from the beginning,” Webster said. “I think it surprised us how hard they played, how physical they were and their length and size and speed. From there it was just an uphill battle.”
It has been a battle all season for the Crimson. After staving off several near losses to win seven of its first eight games in Ancient Eight play, the Crimson carried a one-and-a-half game lead into a road contests at Princeton and Penn on March 1 and 2. Harvard lost both games to fall a half-game behind the Tigers heading into the last weekend of the season, but the team persevered. A pair of Crimson victories and Princeton losses that weekend earned Harvard its second consecutive NCAA tournament berth.
“I think the guys have been able to adjust and to adapt incredibly well as evidenced by where we are right now, and I think that’s the main thing to do,” Amaker said.
Amaker has also given thought to molding the long-term future of the program and talked on Friday about building a Harvard brand on the court to match the one in the classroom.
“I love the word ‘vision’, first of all, and we use that a lot because that was real and truthful from day one of what I felt in my heart about Harvard,” Amaker said. “It’s an incredible brand.  It’s a magical name, and that’s not a knock to any other wonderful place or institution or university.  I just think that it speaks for itself in so many ways of being considered the very best…. What we tried to do is present a vision and present Harvard as an option, as an opportunity.”
With the team notching its first tournament victory and bringing back Casey and Curry next year—in addition to ESPN top 100 recruit Zena Edsomowan—he is well on his way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard softball team took the lead in the top of the ninth, it was three outs away from ending the weekend on a positive note.
After dropping the first game of a two-game series at Syracuse (11-14), the Crimson (5-12) went into the bottom of the inning looking to hold the Orange scoreless and emerge with the win. But a leadoff walk put the tying runner on base, and a sacrifice fly sent the game into the tenth.
Harvard was held scoreless in the top of the tenth, and Syracuse made the Crimson pay in its half of the inning, scoring to put the Orange on top and sweep the weekend.
“We did everything possible to lose that game,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We had no desire to win that game. We need to step up with our energy.”
The Crimson relied on freshman pitcher Morgan Groom for the bulk of the work. After starting the first game and throwing four-and-a-third innings, Groom pitched five-and-two-thirds in relief of sophomore Gabrielle Ruiz.
On the weekend, Groom gave up seven earned runs on five hits. She struck out twelve batters and allowed nine walks.
“She shouldered the work this weekend, and when her stuff was in the zone she was very, very effective,” Allard said. “She threw too many balls and had too many walks; that was our big mistake on the weekend. We just need to challenge the hitters more.”
SYRACUSE 5, HARVARD 4
The Orange jumped out to an early lead with two runs in the first and held the lead until the fifth, but the Crimson continued to chip away.
“We need to come out from the beginning with intensity and a sense of urgency,” said senior designated hitter Jessica Ferri. “I know in a lot of our games we’ve had some rough starts. If we clean up the early innings, hopefully they won’t come back to bite us late in games.”
Harvard added a run in the top of the third after sophomore left fielder Andrea Del Conte reached on an error and was brought home when co-captain right fielder Shelbi Olson singled through the right side.
Syracuse answered with a run of its own in the bottom of the fifth on a Morgan Dandin solo home run, and a two run homer by Ferri brought the score to a tie.
Freshman centerfielder Zoe Galindo continued the homerun derby with a go-ahead jack in the ninth, but the Orange brought it to a tie and scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth.
The Crimson faced two different pitchers and outhit Syracuse, 11-4, with no strikeouts.
“Any loss is going to be disappointing,” Ferri said. “A loss where we were ahead and lost that lead is especially tough. It’s just a learning experience, and it builds character.”
SYRACUSE 6, HARVARD 2
Orange pitcher Lindsay Taylor pitched the complete game and allowed only two hits, a single and a homerun to Galindo that scored both of the Crimson’s runs in the second.
Harvard had difficulty stringing hits together and was held scoreless for the remainder of the game.
“We faced the same pitcher the whole game, and she definitely threw well,” Ferri said. “We weren’t really adjusting. We were putting the ball in play but we weren’t really making her come to us.”
Syracuse started scoring early, putting up two in the first and adding three in the fifth. The Orange added its final run in the sixth on a series of Crimson mistakes.
First baseman Jasmine Watson started off the rally with a single up the middle and advanced to second on a walk. She took third on a wild pitch and scored on an error by junior third baseman Kasey Lange.
Groom pitched the first four innings and allowed five runs on two hits, walking four. She was relieved by fellow freshman Jamie Halula, who allowed the final run.
The games at Carrier Dome were Harvard’s final two on the road before playing at home for the first time on Tuesday.
Although the Crimson did not come away with a win for the weekend, Ferri was pleased with the improvements made.
“I thought we played pretty well,” Ferri said. “They were two close games, and we were in a position to win both of them. We were right there. We just need that little extra push to get both wins.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the lone medal in the Lone Star State for sophomore Peregrine Badger in San Antonio, Tex., at the NCAA Fencing Championships this weekend.
The Crimson, which qualified 11 out of a possible 12 athletes for the tournament, placed sixth in a field of 25 schools. Princeton topped the competition for first overall and was trailed by Notre Dame, Penn State, Ohio State and St. John’s.
Badger, competing in the men’s epee, was the top finishing fencer for Harvard. The sophomore, improving on his sixth place finish last year, moved up from second to first team All-American honors.
“The bouts that I lost really motivated me to fight really hard over the next match-ups,” Badger said. “That kind of kept me going through the game. I was completely exhausted by the end.”
Badger picked up seventeen wins through his 23 qualifying bouts and tallied a total 101 touches for a positive indicator of 27. He entered the semi-finals as the top seed and faced Marco Canevari of Ohio State..
“Peregrine is one of those individuals with a terrific amount of talent,” Harvard coach Peter Brand said. “He has performed erratically during the year so to some extent his performance today was really actually pretty much what I expected.”
Canevari, the 2012 bronze medalist, took a commanding lead, 10-6, with time ticking away.
“I think Marco was especially playing one tactic over and over again,” Badger said. “I was experimenting with solutions throughout the bout and it was only at the end that I really figured out some satisfactory ways to deal with what he was doing.”
Despite falling behind, Badger began a comeback in the final seconds of the contest. While Badger came within one, it was too late as the Buckeye nabbed the win as the clock ran out, securing a spot in the finals.
“Time was running out and I figured out one of the solutions really fast and had to get it done,” Badger said, “I was really proud of that because oftentimes you open with one tactic and your opponent figures it out and you have to change tactics. I got three points in a row and then he finally changed tactics.”
Canevari would go on to claim the gold medal and national title.
Foil provided two more top ten finishes for Harvard. Sophomore Brian Kaneshige and freshman Michael Woo finished seventh and eighth, respectively. Kaneshige won 15 qualifying bouts while Woo collected 14. The pair were both named second-team All Americans.
Just outside of the top ten was junior Michael Raynis in the epee, who garnered an All-American Honorable Mention with 13 wins.
The Crimson struggled to find success in the saber. Junior Eric Arzoian won nine bouts with an indicator of negative eight for fifteenth place. Sophomore Alexander Ryjik finished six places behind, with just seven wins.
On the women’s side, junior Alexandra Kiefer led the effort for the Crimson with fifteen wins in the foil. Kiefer, who finished just outside of medal contention, was 11th at last year’s competition after capturing the title as a freshman.
“She felt, and I agreed, that she was a lot looser the second year after winning the NCAA Championships because you’ll always have a tremendous amount of pressure to perform,” Brand said. “This year she felt a lot better and there was no pressure.”
Kiefer’s younger sister, Lee Kiefer, a freshman at Notre Dame, won the foil event. The younger Kiefer dropped just one bout of her 23 qualifying matches, the contest with her sister.
Freshman Nina van Loon was the next top fencer for the Crimson. Van Loon came out with an indicator of four over her 12 wins for eleventh place. Teammate Emma Vaggo was close behind in fourteenth with 10 victories.
In the saber, first-year Aliya Itzkowitz picked up a twelfth place finish with 11 winning bouts and a positive indicator of three. Sophomore Kara Lee was three behind in fifteenth with 11 wins as well, yet had a negative indicator of nine to push her back in the standings.
“Overall it shows that we have very strong fencers on this team,” Brand said. “We have something we can build on next year when we’ll have a couple of very good fencers coming in. I’m very hopeful that we’ll do better next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the rest of her team’s season concluded with a fifth-place finish at the ECAC Championships, junior Sara Li’s season was not quite over. This past weekend, the co-captain was the lone member of the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team to compete at the 2013 NCAA Championships.
“It was an amazing experience,” Li said. “I’m really glad I got to go there for my first time as a junior and really see the level of competition on the national level.”
The junior qualified for and competed in three events over the course of the weekend. First up was Thursday’s 50-meter freestyle. Li clocked in at a time of 22.75 to finish in 37th place. The next day, the junior competed in the 200 free, and her time of 1:46.98 was good for a 34th-place finish. On the final day of competition, Li’s time of 49.50 in the 100 free gave her 38th place.
“Sara was focused on her race plan and enjoyed every moment of being at this prestigious meet,” said head coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski in a press release. “She finished in the middle of the pack in all three races and knows what to expect in the future. More importantly, Sara wants to use the valuable experiences gained to inspire her teammates in hopes of Harvard qualifying more student-athletes for next year’s NCAA championships.”
In her first time competing at the national championship meet, Li was able to test herself against the nation’s perennial powerhouses. The University of Georgia beat-out two-time defending champion California for the national title, with Tennessee rounding out the top three.
Sophomore Courtney Otto also qualified for the NCAA Championships in three events—the 200 butterfly, 200 IM, and 400 IM. However, the sophomore was forced to decline the invitation to this year’s championship due to injury. Otto competed in last year’s NCAA Championships alongside then-senior Meghan Leddy, just barely missing the finals in the 200 fly. This season, with Otto sidelined, Li was the lone member of the Crimson contingent.
“We really are on the national level,” Li said. “I was the only one this year from our team, but I know that a lot of other girls on our team are also capable of competing at NCAA’s and doing really well. It’s exciting to know that we’re right there with them.”
Li qualified for the national championships after setting school records in all three of her events over the course of the ECAC and Ivy League Championships. Li set a program record time of 48.67 in the 100 free as the leadoff leg in the Crimson’s relay team at the ECAC Championships. Her time in the 100 free at that championship broke a 32-year-old Blodgett Pool record. She also bested a school record in the 50 free en route to a third-place finish with a time of 22.46 at the Ivy League Championships. Her time of 1:45.88 in the 200 free at the ECAC Championships set another program record.
Li picked up Ivy titles in the 200 free and the 200 backstroke, and also garnered a second-place finish in 100 free and a third-place showing in the 100 backstroke. She helped Harvard to a first-place finish in the 200 medley relay at Ivies, as well as a third-place finish in the 400 medley and a second-place finish in the 800 freestyle relay.
“I didn’t even know I was going to go [to NCAA’s] until after conferences,” Li said. “I really wasn’t focused on it; I didn’t have it in my plan for the whole year. I was just really happy to be there and experience everything. Hopefully, if I make it back next year, I will be able to have much more focus. I will have more experience.”
In total, seven Ivy League swimmers competed in this weekend’s national championship. Columbia, Harvard, Penn, Princeton, and Yale each boasted qualifiers for the NCAA meet. Three swimmers—Katie Meili of the Lions, the Bulldog’s Alex Forrester, and Lisa Boyce of the Tigers—earned All-American accolades.
“We swim against the Ivy League, and it’s pretty fast, but then you get to the big stage with all the big state schools,” Li said. “They take the competition to a whole new level. It’s pretty inspiring to see.”

Since we last wrote on our Tip Box findings, we've seen months of great turmoil for Harvard, from freak weather storms to email hacking to contentious house rankings. One thing is clear: today's students live in uncertain times. Flyby tips from the past few months reflect the self-doubt and agitation of these trying months, as readers voice epistemological concerns (see Feb. 10), criticisms of society's materialism (Oct. 30), and possible drug-related paranoia (Dec. 13).

The Harvard Management Company certainly isn't headed to the thrift shop with nearly $31 billion dollars in its pocket. Harvard's investments in Smith & Wesson, one of the largest gun distributors in the United States, recently raised concern among alums and current students involved with the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.
But one investment is small potatoes for the HMC. Even if they choose to divest from Smith & Wesson, they'll still have money to blow on high-end retail, tacky shoes, and even large portions of entire countries. You name it—Harvard has probably already invested in it.
Brazil. Harvard's obsession with the country doesn't stop with HUDS' wildly popular Brazilian Brunch. Feijoada and farofa aside, the Brazilian companies listed on the SEC report touch every aspect of Brazilian life. The portfolio includes a huge bank, a giant food distributor, the biggest brewery in Latin America, a mobile telephone company, and multiple energy and power companies. It looks like we should be having Brazilian Brunch every week, courtesy of the HMC.
Crocs. Harvard invests in only the best fashion trends through the Russell 2000 Fund. Investors must have looked around in 2005 and decided that the future of footwear lay in the tacky and plastic version of the boating shoe—a staple of any Harvard outfit. As with the stuffy morning suits that you might see at Commencement, Harvard continues to support terrible fads that should have died quietly years ago.
Victoria's Secret. Oh Harvard, you sexy beast—use that endowment well. According to the SEC report, Harvard invests in Limited Brands, the parent company of Victoria's Secret and PINK. Every time you buy that lacy and uber-supportive bra, you are also valiantly supporting your school's dedication to financial aid, scientific research, and academic stamina.
