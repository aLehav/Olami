After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mention of Houghton Library usually evokes, first and foremost, an inquisitive stare. “Houghton? What’s that? Oh, the building between Widener and Lamont? Like where Pusey is?” Those who have heard of the place before are usually no better at guessing what goes on inside. “I heard it’s a restricted library,” someone told me, not too long ago, when I told him I work there. “You have to get permission to go in.”
Some people, however, venture to ask me about the human-skin-bound book. “Wait, isn’t that where they keep it?” they say, their expressions a mix of disgust and wonder, something that only the bizarre can catalyze. “Have you ever seen it?”
I chuckle, sighing internally. I have seen the human-skin-bound book—seen it but not touched it. My supervisors had called it up for an interview with The Crimson in which I was supposed to partake; the interviewer never came, but I went down to their office in the basement anyway. It lay on the other side of the table, across from me, its unassuming leather covering indistinguishable from its living form. Human leather is eerily similar to pigskin.
Like most of my peers, I was aware that the book existed even before I arrived at Harvard. It became international news on June 2014, when biological tests confirmed the composition of its cover. All of them mentioned the provenance of the skin used to bind the book. The Crimson, in an article from 2006, describes it best when quoting from “[n]otes from a now-missing typed memorandum”: “the back of the unclaimed body of a woman patient in a French mental hospital who died suddenly of apoplexy.”
When matters such as this come to light, it is fascinating to observe what the media deems worthy of note—what vehicles of mass communication believe will attract the broadest readership.
CNN, for instance, dedicated an entire section of its story on the issue to the biological tests effected on cover samples of the book. The New York Times only revealed that “the book was bound in skin taken from the back of a woman,” making no reference to the aforementioned details run in The Crimson. Most sources were simple summaries and rewordings of two Houghton Library blog posts—one from May 24, 2014, announcing the book’s existence, and one from June 4, confirming that it was indeed bound in human skin. All of them referenced the book’s author, Arsène Houssaye, and his explanation for his binding decision: “A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering.” None of them wondered about the true owner of the leather of the book’s cover.
That disembodied skin, however, once belonged to an individual as complex as the book’s author or anyone reading this article. She did not consent to have her skin turned into a book’s cover. The fact that her body was unclaimed upon her death objectified her in a very literal manner, something that very few people seemed disposed to discuss when Houghton’s skin-bound book became a Harvard must-see. The covering of Houssaye’s forgotten volume about the soul, in its own author’s view, was supposed to dignify it; to judge from the reactions of a 21st century audience, it seems that the “human covering” was a disservice to that humanizing mission.
The book bound in human skin, like every other item at Houghton, has a fascinating story behind it; as one associate librarian affirmed, however, the volume was “one of the author’s lesser works.” Its cover might be peculiar, but its content does not attract international attention. That is the exception to the rule. The library contains almost 30 centuries of other extraordinary stories waiting to be uncovered by Harvard undergraduates—who, by the way, do not need permission to enter Houghton. It is home to the illustrious and the anonymous; the hallowed and the profane; the commonplace and the unconventional; the traditional and the bizarre. Throughout this semester, I hope to highlight some of the best stories hiding beneath the Yard’s southeast corner—and to encourage you, reader, to go find your own personal favorite. Take some time off your problem set, make your way to the Houghton Reading Room, and call something up from the stacks. You never know what you might find, but I can assure you it won’t disappoint.

News on diasporas today often centers on counting streams of Syrian refugees and, while accurate in the most factual sense, this kind of crisis-focused coverage often leaves unexplored the everyday lives of most immigrants. “Asmarina,” a documentary by Alan Maglio and Medhin Paolos, explores this theme. The film, which was shown at the Center for Government and International Studies on Sept. 26 and was followed by a conversation with Paolos, represents a departure from the doom and gloom genre, instead delving into issues of mobility, diaspora, and xenophobia as they affect the daily lives of the film’s subjects.
The documentary is named after its invisible main character: Asmara, the Eritrean capital, hovers behind the film. Often personified as a woman in the memories of the subjects, the city’s simultaneous absence and presence imbues the film with a sense of unconsummated longing. In one scene, a woman calls her husband to play the song “Asmarina” for her, a musical signature of the Eritrean diaspora community. “I remember that!” the man says. “It’s from the ’30s!” Paolos mentioned after the screening that the song was actually from the ’50s, but she left the footage unchanged, trying to preserve the subjectivity of people’s memories. Throughout the film, songs, stories, and family albums are motifs through which the past is explored. Prosperous Eritrean families pose together, their smiles unmodified by the passage of years. Meanwhile, their descendants negotiate their Eritrean identity in Italy. Women make coffee in the traditional way, and men dance to music in the park as passersby look on. In one scene, a biracial Eritrean-Italian man describes his first night with a white woman.
While the director portrays these everyday moments, she is also quick to dig into the colonial history that created them. “The first apartheid was not in South Africa, but in Eritrea,” Paolos said. During the 19th century, Italy established the colony of Italian Eritrea in Ethiopia and assembled a diverse group of peoples under colonial rule. In an attempt to control the native population, the Italian government introduced segregated neighborhoods and strict curfew laws in the region, which would later break off from Ethiopia. The political unrest that resulted many years later caused hundred of Eritreans and Ethiopians to flee their country—and end up in Italy.
“[The Italians] are saying they don’t want us, but they are the reason [we] came here, and they need to accept the consequences of their actions,” Paolos said.

When the single-gender policy came out last semester, the dining halls buzzed with robust debate. The topic loomed so large that it even spawned imaginary scenarios about the policy’s few visible craftsmen. Friends assigned motivations to administrators and speculations of political maneuvering ran rampant, and I began to feel that we were living under the dystopic rule of villains like those in “House of Cards.” As a large, bureaucratic, faceless entity, the administration is easy to demonize. But what happens when we assume best intentions? In the coming weeks, this column will use personal portraits to introduce some of the not-so-visible administrators who work to form our community.

In the major exhibition of the works of William Merritt Chase that opens at the Museum of Fine Arts on Oct. 9, a different artist seems on display in each room: a Baroque master, an American Impressionist, a Japanese-inspired painter. Yet all 80 of the pieces in the exhibit were painted by the versatile but relatively little-known Chase (1849-1916). Chase’s style blended realism and Impressionism and influenced many later artists through his work as a teacher. Organized by the MFA’s senior curator of American paintings, Erica E. Hirshler; curator Elsa Smithgall from The Phillips Collection; and curator Katherine M. Bourguignon from the Terra Foundation for American Art, the exhibition displays Chase’s work in rooms devoted to particular phases of his artistic style and distinct periods of his working life.
The exhibition opens with some of Chase’s most accomplished and intriguing work, painted in his studio on Tenth Street in New York. Rich colors and an air of mystery characterize many of the works on view. The first painting that viewers see when they walk in is “The Young Orphan (An Idle Moment),” a portrait of a black-clad, reclining young woman against a rusty red background. Many of the works in this gallery suggest the presence of a narrative but ultimately remain unresolved and ambiguous. The painting “The Tenth Street Studio” shows a woman and Chase himself in the studio, for example, but leaves their conversation and the circumstances of their meeting to the viewer’s imagination.
The following gallery emphasizes Chase’s ability to draw on the Old Masters to represent modern subjects. “Ready for the Ride,” painted during Chase’s time at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, shows a woman with a riding crop gripped securely in her hand, a pose often featured in portraits by 17th-century artist Anthony van Dyck. Yet Chase’s work introduces a very modern narrative: A confident woman replaces the aristocratic gentleman who was the typical subject of the Old Masters’ canvases.
In her talk with the press, exhibition curator Bourguignon discussed this synthesis of old and new. “[Chase] really found his own style but was willing to keep changing it…. So I think you can see the influences from Whistler, from Sargent, from the Old Masters, but Chase at least was confident in himself enough to be able to blend those into his own style,” she said.
Exhibition curator Smithgall also commented in an interview on Chase’s versatility. “What is so exciting about Chase is that he will continue to be very fluid in moving back and forth across subject and style,” she said.
Other galleries demonstrate Chase’s sheer ability to capture light and texture. The paintings “Lydia Field Emmet” and “Portrait of Dora Wheeler” stand side by side next to “Still Life—Fish,” a seemingly incongruous juxtaposition. Hirshler explained that this choice reflects Chase’s conception of his own practice. “For Chase, it’s really the act of painting that is critical, and for Chase, it was a similar exercise in a way to show the papery skin of an onion or the tulle of a woman’s dress, the sheen of a fresh fish or the sheen of a satin ribbon,” she said.
According to the exhibition’s curators, Chase’s work has received relatively little attention since his death in 1916. Hirschler said that the current show at the MFA is the first solo exhibition of his work in Boston since 1886. She added that she believes Chase merits recognition as a major figure in 19th-century American painting. “He is such an artistic sponge that he’s pulling things that he thinks are beautiful or that he admires from different corners of the world and from different time periods, and somehow he was able to bring them all together to create a work that could be by nobody but Chase,” she said.

About halfway through the second movement of Franz Schubert’s String Quartet No. 15 in G Major, D. 887, the Parker Quartet seemed to make time stop, playing within a quivering freeze-frame and letting sound mesmerize the audience in Paine Hall last Friday.
The Parker Quartet, a string ensemble, did, in fact, move during the piece—indeed, with enough force to strip several hairs from their bows—but they cast a stillness over the audience that allowed them to unlock a multitude of moods within each note. The members of the quartet, founded in 2002 in Boston, teach in the Music Department, offer workshops around the University, and perform undergraduate and graduate compositions as part of the Blodgett Artist-in-Residence Program. Taken together, their renditions of Schubert’s quartet and the more contemporary  String Quartet No. 2 in C Major, Op. 36 by English composer Benjamin Britten enabled the players to showcase an array of talents, from their intimate individual playing styles to the unity of the group.
The Parker Quartet’s rendition of the Schubert piece was striking because of their ability not only to evoke the magisterial quality of the piece with impeccable technique, but also to heighten the intimacy, the inner vibrations, of each note. Through the music, the group transported the audience—clad on this dreary evening in a mix of silk scarves, chunky knits, and rain-dampened blazers—to the springtime open-air parlors of Romantic-era European drawing rooms. The breezy flirtations between the violins (Daniel Chong and Ying Xue) and the viola (Jessica Bodner) were ensnared by the cello’s (Kee-Hyun Kim, an especially emotive player) subtler moody tangles. Taken together, the back-and-forth musings of the instruments fluctuated between private parlor room conversations and a more triumphal, presentational mode. But the musicians went beyond beautiful playing, especially in the third movement, retreating with a soft, plucky patter before mounting a grand allegro.
If the second piece, the Schubert, resounded with personal confidences expressed quietly beneath Romantic splendour, the first piece, the Britten, made an impact with its popcorn-style, in-tempo/out-of-tempo playing. In the first movement, the quartet hit all of the staccato beats while retaining the smoothness of each note. The last notes exemplified the piece’s oscillation between a jumping playfulness and a softer side, which together created a come-follow-me beckoning to the next section of the piece. That next movement, a chase-like call and response, seemed better suited to the dark depths of an Artemisian forest than to a concert hall. During one section, the players tossed the beat from one instrument to the next, each musician picking up where the previous one left off, until all the strings coalesced. Chong in particular during this section pushed his violin until the instrument buzzed like a bee and reverberated with harmonious intensity. And Kim on cello exuded so much emotion while playing that his shining brow and frequent deep breaths infused the lively music with even more vitality.
The stylistic variety of the Britten piece highlighted the best of what the quartet performed—their remarkable ability to construct and break down different emotions and personalities within the same piece. The musicians, each a master of his or her own instrument, both played intimately for themselves and communicated deep feelings when they played together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Teddy Wayne’s “Loner” may not be the first novel ever written about disaffected male college students pining for beautiful women, but it could well be the bleakest. David Federman, the titular loner, arrives at Harvard in a fit of social anxiety; eager to seize the high social standing that he feels he deserves, he begins to choose friends based on their physical attractiveness and general level of glamour. Suddenly, he stumbles upon the beautiful and wealthy Veronica Wells, a physical embodiment of the upward mobility he so craves. What starts as a harmless attraction quickly becomes a disturbing and invasive obsession. David follows her around campus, takes covert pictures of her, and feigns romantic interest in her roommate—and it only gets worse from there. To be sure, the novel contains some insightful and well-wrought criticisms of elite college life, but the unrelentingly repulsive narrator and uniformly dark tone ultimately stifle the story’s brighter points.
Wayne’s critique of college social life hinges on the problem of gender-based violence, a horrifically common presence at colleges around the country and a particularly important topic at Harvard right now, given the sexual assault survey that came out last year. The novel successfully portrays different forms of such harm, including rape but also reaching beyond it: stalking, subtle sexual coercion, and more all appear in David’s first-person narration at one time or another. Wayne’s awareness of different manifestations of harmful gender dynamics even extends beyond physical violence—a relatively unusual and impressive authorial move. At several points, the novel jokes about the “male gaze:” True to genre form, characters take gender studies classes and laugh about their apparent  absurdity. However, after tipping his hat to this staple of campus life, Wayne comes down firmly in support of what the students think is silly. The entire novel enacts the concept of scopophilia, David’s perspective continually reducing the women in his life to (literal) objects of sexual pursuit without any interiority or agency at all.
The reason for all of this violence, Wayne intelligently suggests, has to do with multifaceted, interwoven concepts of male entitlement: Cultural narratives about college and sexual experience, fratty competition within male groups, and societal scripts about female desire. At one point, David finds himself confronted with a female classmate’s misgivings about an encounter with him; he dismisses her pain and snarls, “This was college. People had sex. They didn’t just hold hands and masturbate.” In his eyes, college—and therefore college women—owe him sex for no better reason than that he has heard legends of orgies. Even further, he subscribes to the deeply ingrained idea that he can exchange adoration and impressiveness for sex and that women have no real right to refuse the transaction. Within his group of friends, too, sexual experience equals dominance and status—women become nothing more than points on a scoreboard.
Wayne pushes this reasoning even further. As the book progresses, he sketches a reason why sexual assault might be so terribly common at Harvard and other top colleges. The kind of male who would get into Harvard, he suggests, might have had a socially underwhelming high school career: He might have had minimal sexual experience or experience with women in general and an overwhelming sense that he has not gotten the social rewards that his exceptional self deserves. David’s entitlement proves so intense—and ultimately so damaging—because he feels that he has been essentially cheated and that a Harvard acceptance letter constitutes a kind of apology and promise from the universe. Campus sexual assault, Wayne suggests, is then not Harvard’s fault. Sexual assault is a problem of a self-selecting population, not institutional shortcomings. “It’s convenient, in hindsight, to blame Harvard. But it wasn’t the guilty party,” David says. An extremely provocative argument, certainly, but a nuanced and carefully designed one.
All of this social criticism, however, just forms the scaffolding for the novel. The meat of “Loner” is the direct experience of David’s consciousness. Wayne writes in the tradition of the unreliable narrator, adhering particularly closely to Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita”: Nabokov’s novel features a narrator who describes morally ambiguous sexual activity with breathtakingly beautiful language, and David likewise describes his exploits in elaborate prose. The difference, though, lies in the successful creation of sympathy. The narration of Humbert Humbert in “Lolita” creates a complex push-pull between repulsion and complicity, horror and desire. The language often beguiles, and sometimes the sex (pedophilia, specifically) seems almost allowable. “Loner,” though, lacks this dynamism and the resulting aesthetic and intellectual brilliance. David’s prose style, though baroque, lacks real beauty, and his actions never seem close to justified. Even Wayne’s attempts at making David seem pitiable fail dramatically. Rather than the queasy sense of complicity that Humbert creates, David simply produces unproductive and uninteresting disgust—and the sheer pain of listening to him drowns out every flash of interest in the novel’s social critique.
Granted, the relationship between reader and narrator remains an inherently subjective experience. Others—people less sensitive to the issue of sexual assault, or people less likely to become emotionally invested in the books they read—might well be able to withstand David’s voice and find themselves able to engage with Wayne’s critiques. It would also be easy to argue that consistent horror is not exactly a literary problem; there is no law decreeing that unenjoyable literature is fundamentally bad literature. Still, two simple facts remain: Really liking this book seems inherently pathological, and I would not wish the experience of reading it upon anyone.

On Sept. 30, with two weeks to go before it hosts its first ceramics classes, Cabot Third Space—“It’s not a study space, and it’s not a living space; it’s just a space for art,” says Phoebe C. West ’18-’19—is not yet quite ready.
“As you can see, we’re still putting finishing touches up,” says Tiffanie Ting, Resident Dean of Cabot House, over the loud whine of a drill.
“We’ve kind of had a whirlwind getting this space ready to go,” West, Third Space’s manager, says. Still, the place has already undergone an impressive transformation. Founded in 2013 as a 2-D art studio, its team of student leaders is focused on developing it into a more comprehensive workspace, one that serves social and intellectual functions in addition to its role as a creative haven. To do so, they’ve physically expanded it: Third Space has six brand-new pottery wheels and a new kiln in an area of the basement of Cabot’s Eliot Hall that was, as recently as last semester, dedicated to bike shop Quad Bikes. Soon to follow, its organizers will be students—painting, drawing, throwing pots, or just observing. “It’s this big Cabot push to bring the arts into the forefront,” West says.
The bigger-and-better Third Space joins a rich array of arts institutions within Harvard’s 12 Houses. At Harvard, participating in the arts—whether through extracurricular activities like Hasty Pudding Theatricals or the Harvard Advocate or through academic departments like that of Visual and Environmental Studies—often requires previous experience, an involved comp process, or a significant time commitment. The Houses create lower-stress creative outlets for students. In turn, as administrators look to shift Harvard’s social life away from off-campus social organizations, arts spaces in the Houses serve as new centers for student engagement.
In a building just north of Third Space sits a very different kind of arts resource: Cabot Theater. Ting guesses most students are more familiar with the place as an entrance to the Aquarium, a party space, than as a performance venue. “It’s been relatively dormant,” she says. (West is more blunt: “It pretty much goes unused beyond being the hallway to the Aquarium.”) Historically, the stage was busier, hosting Cabot’s annual musical—a tradition soon to return, Ting says. She hopes that Cabot Theater, armed with this renewed programming as well as other events like coffeehouses, will join the ranks of other House-supported theaters, like those in Adams or Leverett, as major campus venues. “We’re really using Adams Pool Theater as a model,” she says.

Indeed, the Pool Theater serves as a case study of a House institution playing a vital role in the campus arts scene while serving the goals of the House system. Adams Pool Theater, as its name suggests, stands in the former location of Adams’s indoor pool, which the House replaced in 1990. Concerned about the pool’s high maintenance cost and, perhaps, its reputation for debauchery, administrators decided to fill it and build a theater—a move that dovetailed with Adams’s longstanding reputation as an artistic House.
Today, the Pool Theater is one of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s most frequent staging spaces. This semester alone, it is slated to host four plays as well as Three Letter Acronym’s annual improv festival.
According to Kara E. Roberts ’17, an Adams resident who has worked on eight shows in the Pool Theater, Adams drama tutor Aubry Threlkeld chooses shows with the theater’s distinctive traits in mind. “He looks for projects that kind of fit… the Pool’s niche,” she says—namely student-written or experimental plays with small casts. “I think the Pool Theater is really suited well to a lot of smaller, more intimate projects,” she says, citing her own project, this weekend’s photography-based musical “35mm,” as an example.
The Adams Pool Theater is especially suited for staging small musicals, in part because the Pool Theater’s acoustics trump those of the Loeb Experimental Theater, according to Roberts. “These smaller projects that are done in the Pool are a way for simpler and more intimate musical theater to happen at Harvard,” she says.
Third Space hopes to find a different kind of niche: one of geography. “There are studios in some of the River Houses,”  West says, “but that’s a hike.” The distance to the Harvard Ceramics Studio, in Allston, inconvenient even for residents of the Yard and River Houses, can be all but prohibitive for Quadlings, especially at night—for some students the only time that they can fit the arts into their schedules. “So we’re kind of trying to fill a need here in the Quad for supplementary arts,” West says, “and ceramics courses are hard to get to and often late at night, [which are problems] for people who live in the Quad.”
Although some House arts institutions, like Adams Pool Theater, pride themselves on their relatively high-quality output, the most common purpose for House arts programs is that of the open-mic night: a creative outlet without the demands of a typical Harvard academic program or extracurricular activity. As Freshman Class Dean Thomas A. Dingman ’67 told Harvard Magazine in 2013, “The Houses serve as a wonderful ground for amateurism.”
Many Houses, from Mather to Leverett to Lowell, host coffeehouses and open mic nights. Despite its artsy reputation, Adams had no such regular program—until Sept. 24. “The idea kind of came to me from some of the students in the House who were really good musicians and were always looking for a place where they could perform. That was last year,” says Ajay Singh ’18, the secretary of the Adams House Committee.
Early this year, Singh brought the idea to Adams’s music tutors, and within the month, students were gathered in the Upper Common Room to watch their classmates perform in a broad variety of media. “We had musical performances, we had dance, we had poetry, we had a story reading, we had science theater, we had a little bit of everything, which made it a lot of fun,” says Or Gadish ’10-’11, the lead music tutor in Adams, where he also lived as an undergraduate. “And [we had] a really good crowd."
But Adams’s music offerings do not stop at the amateur. “We also want to give students the opportunity to showcase their music at a higher level,” Gadish says, citing the annual Concert (formerly the Classical Concert), Winter Feast, and House Teas as venues for more serious musicians. “All of these are opportunities for both the student musicians to perform and for other students to see the student musicians and to see what Adams House has to offer.”
Other Houses also sponsor serious musical work, like the annual Lowell House Opera or Dunster’s Messiah Sing. In each case, the production is open to students of other Houses, meaning the Houses enable students to join higher-level productions without committing themselves to a year in high-caliber performance groups like the Harvard Glee Club or Bach Society Orchestra.

Ting says Cabot Third Space is developing with a goal of accommodating a range of skill sets. “We’re looking to create entry points for people at all skill levels,” she says. “Whether you have no experience or a lot of experience, there’s something for you in the Third Space.”
West concurs. “It’s about getting people of all different skillsets, of all different comforts with art, to have a space to come and hang out and chill for a little while,” she says. “A lot of things are so intense at Harvard, and [Third Space] is, like, a chill place to be, in that you can commit as much time or as little time as you want to it.”
This all-levels-welcome approach, in addition to its aforementioned benefits for individual students’ artistic development, helps House arts organizations—especially House-exclusive institutions like the Kirkland Drama Society—build social ties within the House.
“[KDS] is probably mostly people who have not done other theatre,” says Jacob C. Scherba ’18, KDS president. “There are certainly a couple, myself included, who have been involved in theater in other capacities on campus and before college, but it’s really something we really try to make as open as possible and as welcoming as possible to people.”

KDS produces one show per semester: a Shakespeare-inspired farce in the fall and a play or musical in the spring. According to Scherba, these shows aim for inclusivity within the House. “If we have more people audition than we have parts for, we’ll write more parts, because we want anyone who wants to be involved to be involved,” he says. “So I think it’s a really good opportunity for people who haven’t tried theater and who want to do theater to be able to try it in a really low-stress environment.”
Third Space, on the other hand, is not Cabot-exclusive, but Ting says she hopes it will build relationships between its users. “Studio work can be pretty lonely,” she says. “We’re hoping that this space will bring artists and people in the space together, whether they’re there to draw, paint, or just do other work.”
“A personal stake [I have] in Third Space is cultivating a community of like-minded people who are really kind of invested in art and love it,” West says, adding that, as an African-American Studies concentrator, she does not have the curricular kinship in the arts that a concentration like VES might offer.
The space will have arts-based social events as well, according to Kevin J. Friel ’17, another student leader. “We’re working on a live figure-drawing event right now,” he says. “We’re actually putting a calendar together, hopefully with pretty regular events.”
Houses’ arts institutions form another community as well: the audience. Singh says one of his primary goals in planning Adams’s coffeehouse had nothing to do with the performers’ artistic development. He says he remembers telling the tutors, “Let’s create a space from 7:30 to 9 on a Saturday, where parties aren’t really happening yet, and this could be a space for people who don’t like staying out late but are looking for a social event.”
Singh himself appreciated the variety such an event brought to campus social life. “I’m not one who really likes partying a lot. I’m low-key, for the most part; I’m tired by 10:30,” he says. “I’m not sure if there are other people like me, but I thought it would be nice to have this social space beforehand that’s a little different from a mixer, something where there’s something actively going on.”
By their very nature, House arts institutions uniquely fuse social, intellectual, and creative life. Third Space’s leaders are particularly excited about this flexibility. In addition to serving as a workshop for relaxed artistic work and a social space, West says, Third Space will also host classes with a range of commitment options. “Within the eight-week classes, we’re going to have two-week modules,” she says. A painting class, for example, might have a module on oil painting.
At the Adams coffeehouse, the demonstration Gadish calls “science theater” was perhaps the most overtly intellectual performance, but academic elements snuck their way into other acts, too.  “When we had the coffeehouse night, Sean Palfrey, one of the Faculty Deans here, was there; he read a couple poems,” Gadish says, “and he was there watching everybody else do it.”
To Gadish, Palfrey’s presence shows the House’s belief in the purpose of art. “[The deans] very much think it’s an important part of everybody’s life,” he says, and he agrees with them. “It’s important for people to have a balance of the different parts of their lives, and art in general is just one way to help those things balance—to counterbalance all the work that people put into classes or other extracurriculars. When you practice these creative tasks, it helps you breed creativity in the other aspects of your life,” Gadish says. “That’s why we support it so strongly."

Last week, a story published in The Crimson highlighted the oft-overlooked presence of undocumented students on Harvard’s campus. The piece is an important one for all students to read. While it is commendable that Harvard has an admissions policy that does not discriminate against these students because of their immigration status, Harvard can still take a more proactive approach to making sure their unique needs are fully met on campus.
This effort should start with the admission process, where undocumented students are categorized as international applicants. Tufts and Brown recently revised their admission policies to permit undocumented students to apply as domestic applicants, and we believe Harvard should follow suit. Symbolically, it is an indignity that such students have to apply to colleges in their own country of residence as international students. Many undocumented students know only the United States as home, and they deserve to be treated as Americans by institutions of higher learning.
Furthermore, the University should be more explicit about its policy on accepting undocumented students. This goal could be achieved in ways as simple as creating student profiles and featuring them on the admissions website with more extensive information about the experience of being undocumented at Harvard.
Still, it is important to note that the University has a generous financial aid program that is extended to undocumented students, whose immigration status leaves them ineligible for federal financial aid. These efforts are critical to ensuring that undocumented students can afford to matriculate at Harvard.
Once undocumented students arrive on campus, however, they face unique challenges and often lack the resources to tackle them. While there are two mental health counselors at University Health Services who are known among undocumented students for their knowledge of immigration issues, more diversity is needed in the University’s mental health programs.
And though the recent creation of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion was an important step, the next head of the office should work to create more extensive administrative support for undocumented students to address their unique needs and experiences.
Politically, it is also important to ensure that these students and their families have the protection of the law. The current Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program allows Harvard’s undocumented students the safety to remain on campus and live without constant fear of deportation.
Though we support DACA, the DREAM Act, and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program that was recently blocked by the Supreme Court, all three are ultimately insufficient and highlight the need for comprehensive immigration reform. But until a more comprehensive solution is reached, these smaller steps are important.

Querida Familia,
To our brothers and sisters on campus. To our mothers and fathers back home. To every person who has taught us what our Latinidad is supposed to be. Who we are is a result of what you’ve instilled in us. The strength, resilience, and compassion that nuestra historia, has gifted you, you’ve in turn given to us. Your stories, struggles, joys, and sorrows seep into our skin, our soul, and our Latinx identity–creating Latinidad.
This Latinidad is protection against a cold world. It is the warmth we find in our families. It is laughter over food made by our Abuelitas and Tías, over pupusas revueltas and tamales de puerco. It is the cousins we grew up with, who felt more like siblings. The parties that never seem to end, brought to life by ever-present family and loud music, to create a community that we can’t imagine living without. The phone calls back to El Salvador, or México, or Nicaragua, or Honduras, reminding us that we are American, but hyphenated. Our biculturalism is our strength, and it informs our view of the world in a fuller way. We take our experiences, our families, and our Latinidad and wield it when we seek our inclusion in institutions and countries we love.
On our campus, Latinidad is assumed to mean low-income, first-generation, and adorned with light brown skin. Constantly bombarded by this seemingly quintessential Latinx student laughing on the cover of pamphlets, a smiling light brown face surrounded by other students of color, we internalize its stereotypical stock image of Latinidad as reality. In turn, we forget that Latinidad is more than a just a short checklist of characteristics someone should possess. It is more than any one of our personal narratives.
For some of us, being Latino means embracing machismo and hypermasculinity. It means beating our women and glorifying emotional unavailability. For others, being Latina relies on beauty standards that cling to deep rooted seeds of racism and glorify white skin. Our Tías are loving, but never fail to point out our sun-kissed skin as they warn us against getting darker, raising anti-blackness on an altar. In these ways, Latinidad is partially about the way we view ourselves and the way we view others in our community, but it is also about the way the world views us.
And the way the world views us is dripping with the legacy of white, patriarchal supremacy. Our countries—both the U.S. and those within Latin America—were founded on the idea that the white men who created our governments, pillaged indigenous cultures, and subjugated women were doing us a favor. The remnants are systems of oppression that are so pervasive we can’t always see them. White supremacy and patriarchy dictate our Latinidad so subtly that we begin to believe that the only person who is Latinx is one who embodies their popular stereotype. It becomes easy to think that Latinidad is only brown and Spanish-speaking, but believing this false construction is a disservice to ourselves.
Latinidad is Afro-Latinxs. It is white-passing Latinxs. It is Latinxs who don’t speak Spanish. It is conservative Latinxs. It is queer Latinxs. It is Latinxs who come from the middle class, from wealthy families. Their Latinidad lives and breathes in a space that, according to the way the world makes sense of us, isn’t meant to exist. They attempt to navigate a community that should be unquestionably theirs, but are constantly stripped of their Latinidad when it is deemed outside of the brown-faced, Spanish-speaking personal narrative that we’ve collectively normalized.
When we forget these differences, rifts are born. The tapestry of our experiences is torn with our intolerance and erasure, and to mend these holes, we must actively reject what we’ve been taught. We have to reject the definitions of Latinidad we’ve been conditioned to accept. There is no choice but to reconsider what it means to be Latinx. It is only when we begin to recognize one another as complex, with a wide gradient of melanin and experiences, that we can come together to demand the same of those looking in.
Con Amor,Your Familia

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Along with my fellow board members of the Harvard Republican Club, I long wrestled with the prospect of Donald Trump receiving the nomination and potentially winning the presidency. The club’s decision not to endorse him stems from a party-wide hope to regroup and retake the Oval Office in four years’ time, under the pretense that Republicanism would be damaged by a Trump administration. But it is my contention that Donald Trump possesses presidential attributes and ideals that appeal not only to Republicans, but also to everyone honored to dwell in this country.
In 1775, Founding Father Patrick Henry declared, “There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.” Trump actively gathers support by reawakening a sense of pride in the identity each of us has as an American. Firm and bold promises regarding border security, military prestige, financial supremacy, and the preservation of capitalism strike a deep and patriotic chord with their connotation of national strength. Trump’s advocacy for American greatness does not signify a lack of compassion for foreigners, but rather is a reply to an erosion of our foundations, embodied by tendencies toward entangling political correctness, dangerous diplomacy, and socialistic infringement on the American Dream. His condemnation of Hillary Clinton’s wish to impose more taxes on the wealthy while reducing the incentive for welfare recipients to rise above unemployment stems from trust in the aptitude and desire of all Americans to diligently meet the needs of themselves and those dependent upon them.
As a Christian and a conservative, I am not alone in questioning Trump’s views on certain social matters, but I am confident that he will not allow a reckless desire for change—or a selfish mission to preserve his image—to bypass due process or to silence members of either party. I admire his faith in citizens’ capacity to wield the Second Amendment in an empowering manner. I echo his message of entrepreneurship applied toward providing for oneself and one’s family. And I commend his efforts to engage with the underrepresented—note his frustration at a rally in Colorado, when event coordinators, to avoid a fire hazard, denied admission to many supporters. He is repelled by the prospect of leaving any listeners on the outside looking in.
Some are quick to mention Trump’s fluctuating stances. For instance, a segment in the recent debate dealt with whether he had initially opposed the Iraq war. Through allegations and controversy, his campaign has unwaveringly demonstrated support for our military, confirming his steadfast loyalty to those like my father who have served and continue to serve our nation. In hindsight it is easy to deem past decisions regrettable, but it is unfair to criticize them solely on this premise, and instead we must focus on using the wisdom that history offers for the present. In further response to critics, contemplate the hypocrisy of current Clinton ads, which speak of her desire to give “every man, woman, and child the chance to live up to their God-given potential,” despite her readiness to dismiss the unfulfilled potential of the unborn, evidenced by unprecedented proposals for abortion.
It’s true that Trump lacks political experience, but one individual’s shortage of experience has rarely doomed any endeavor. Consider President Eisenhower, who with a non-political background settled the Suez Canal crisis, signed the 1957 Civil Rights Act, and established the Interstate Highway System. Hope unfailingly rests on appointing seasoned advisors, and in turn to wisely weigh their counsel. It is chosen individuals such as Governor Pence—those undeniably informed in the political sphere—who will sharpen Trump’s understanding.
Weeks ago, Trump’s rhetoric involved Clinton’s escape from federal prosecution in the wake of her email scandal, generating legitimate concern about the Democrats’ integrity in upholding Constitutionality equally in all cases. Later, he focused on the Democratic Party’s ineffectiveness in combating racial tensions despite an ever-increasing influx of funding in intercity communities. He has noted Clinton’s lack of vigilance, as witnessed by her role in the overly concessive nuclear deal with Iran, whose leader has openly spoken for “death to America”—in fact, sanctions were lifted prematurely last week from two Iranian banks that had supported Iran’s ballistic missile program. In what he has said and written, his attacks have centered on Clinton’s tangible failure (or on matters that would induce failure). Moreover, though she is not to be blamed for shortfalls of President Obama’s domestic policy, the role of any new candidate is to put forth solutions to problems left by his or her predecessor. With Clinton, we instead see a disappointing absence of ideas to remedy the more than $19 trillion national debt and to alleviate racial unrest, and a refusal to recognize the downfalls of the Affordable Health Care Act.
In a scenario where the vote will most pivotally shape our course, I urge all who will listen not to dismiss their qualms about Donald Trump, but foremost to genuinely consider his merits and the capacity he has to admirably serve the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editor:
I was ecstatic to have received an email over the summer announcing the creation of a secondary field in European History, Politics, and Societies. Perfect, I thought to myself. I am an American who lived for five years abroad in Luxembourg as a child. I am proficient in French and am learning to speak Spanish. I have familial connections to Germany and Ireland.
My main academic interests center around international relations and European society, too. While my concentration, Social Studies, is able to combine with other regional concentrations as joint concentrations, including African and African American Studies; the Study of Women, Gender, and Sexuality; East Asian Studies; and South Asian Studies, a joint concentration between Social Studies and Romance Studies is currently impossible due to a dearth of departmental course offerings. Finally, I believed, Harvard was offering me the opportunity to combine my personal and academic narratives under one coherent secondary program. Harvard was listening to me.
Flash forward to now, as I read the Crimson article “European Secondary Frustrates Advocates for Ethnic Studies.” I recognize the need for the creation of a range of ethnic studies secondary programs. I wholeheartedly support those fighting to have such programs realized. Harvard is lagging behind its peers in this regard.
However, if I were to write that the creation of another ethnic studies field prior to the creation of a European Studies field was personally disheartening, redundant, frustrating, or hurtful, others would not hesitate to castigate me. If The Crimson were to publish such a story, it too would be admonished. This is certainly a double standard.
I trust those quoted in the article bear no ill will to me or the countless other students at Harvard of European descent. Despite their intent, however, I find their comments disrespectful. The existence of a European Studies secondary is not mutually exclusive with other ethnic studies fields, and people should not disdain the creation of one in the absence of another. Let us recognize that what one may find personally frustrating is a boon to another, and that language carries implications for which we all are responsible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2016, at 6:05 p.m.
Student leaders who have sought greater ethnic representation in Harvard’s academic offerings said they found the creation of a new undergraduate secondary field in European History, Politics, and Societies disheartening.
Over the past several years, students have pushed for more opportunities to take ethnic studies courses and for the establishment of degree programs within those fields, including Asian American studies and Native American studies. Last fall, after years of student advocacy for a Latino studies program, the College unveiled a secondary in the field.
This fall, the Center for European Studies announced a new secondary field that would offer students "a more guided process for studying Europe," the center's Executive Director Elaine M. Papoulias said over the summer.
Ruben E. Reyes Jr. ’19, a Crimson editorial writer who serves on the board of three groups for Latino students, said he thought the new secondary’s focus on history, societies, and politics was redundant in the context of Harvard’s other course offerings.
“There is natural tendency that the way we teach history, politics, et cetera is European,” he said.
The new European studies secondary came from more than three years of discussions between center administrators, member of the Standing Committee on European Studies, and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Reyes said he thought the creation of the secondary was frustrating because he was not aware of any student demand. In comparison, student activism led to the creation of the Latino Studies secondary and is at the heart of the recently-formed Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies (TAPAS).
“Underneath it all, it’s educational for those of us involved in these movements, learning that this is the way that secondary programs get established,” Kaipo Matsumoto ’17, a student involved the push for Native American and Asian American studies, said, arguing that the new secondary has “more to do with external funding sources, established centers.”
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to the existence of concentrations that study diverse populations, such as African and African American Studies, East Asian Studies, and Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, as well as the secondary in Ethnicity, Migrations, and Rights.
Currently, there is no secondary in Native American studies, which has long frustrated students who point to Harvard’s founding charter, which states a commitment to educating Native American students. Additionally, though the College has recently seen an increase in Asian American studies courses offered this semester, there is no secondary field in that topic. Such a formal support structure could help students interested in the field move forward academically, Juhwan Seo ’17, a member of TAPAS, said.
“There are plenty of students already writing their junior papers or theses on these topics, and they’re not getting the support that they need,” Seo said.
Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, another advocate for Latino studies and director of student group Concilio Latino, also expressed disappointment with the new secondary. She said she was “sure that it wasn’t intentional” that the College created a European studies secondary ahead of other ethnic secondaries.
She said, “It might not be intentional, but to me, it comes across as hurtful to communities of color.”
Some students acknowledged that the creation of the new secondary concentration was likely an easy move, given that the Center for European Studies is a well-resourced, longstanding institution. For Seo, this decision highlights the relative dearth of resources dedicated to ethnic studies.
“Especially at a more traditional and slow-working machine like Harvard, [grassroots advocacy] is unlikely to bring about significant change unless we disrupt the campus, and often disruption is money,” Seo said, emphasizing the need for funds for a center for race and ethnicity.
Staff from the Center for European Studies declined to comment.

UPDATED: October 6, 2016 at 3:34 p.m.
On Monday, visitors to the Harvard Arts Museums got a rare peek into the archives of past exhibits during "Archives Open Hours."
The event was part of American Archives Month, an initiative by institutions across the country to open their archives to the public throughout October.
During the archive's event, archivists taught visitors about the museum’s history and past exhibits by explaining the context of artifacts on display.
Events documented ranged from the construction of the Fogg Art Museum’s first building to a past exhibit that showcased edible art, and included documents that dated to over a century ago.
Megan Schwenke, a senior archivist at the Harvard Art Museums, said that the event allows people to see documents to which they might not otherwise have access.
“It’s a really great opportunity for us to participate in American Archives Month and also just give the public an opportunity to see what I think is a lesser known collection at the museum,” she said.
Rebecca L. Torres ’02 , a communications staff assistant at the Harvard Art Museums and former Crimson photographer who visited the exhibit, said, “It’s really exciting to come to events like this where they kind of open the door to the archives to see just a small snippet of the rich history that’s here.”
This year, archivists focused on the process of designing various exhibits that appeared at the Harvard Art Museums. They included pictures of curators planning the layout of exhibits and selecting the artwork for galleries.
Ariana L. Chaivaranon ’18, who attended the archive’s open hours, said visiting the archives made her realize how art has evolved throughout the museum’s history.
“I think [the exhibit] just gives you a really interesting perspective on where you are now,” she said.
Schwenke said archivists at the Harvard Art Museums intend to participate in American Archives Month every year. Harvard Art Museums’ archivists will hold Open Hours every Monday in October except Columbus Day.
The archivists also plan to display their records during a program called Open Archives, which makes archives at various institutions in Cambridge accessible to the public for one week next summer.
“Cambridge has the most archival repositories per square foot in the world,”  Schwenkesaid. “The idea is that everybody gets a glimpse into the rich history of Cambridge all in one week.”
The archives are usually located in the Somerville Research Facility and are open to the public by appointment during the week.

Nearly half of decided Harvard College Republicans not backing Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump have instead opted to support Libertarian Party nominee Gary E. Johnson, according to club president Declan P. Garvey ’17.
In a straw poll first sent to club members over the summer, 76 percent of respondents declined to support Trump, while 12 percent supported Trump, and 12 percent were unsure, Garvey said. 
Of those who disavowed Trump, 47 percent planned to support Johnson, 26 percent planned to support Democratic nominee Hillary R. Clinton, and 26 percent said they would back other candidates.
Overall, a plurality, or 36 percent of respondents, said they supported Johnson.
Earlier this summer, the Republican Club denounced Trump in a scathing statement, citing “both policy and temperamental concerns” about the Republican standard-bearer. The decision is the first time that the club–the oldest college Republican chapter in the country–declined to endorse their party’s presidential nominee since the group’s founding in 1888.
Kiera O’Brien ’20, a Republican Club member who supports Johnson, wrote in an email that she did not believe either major party candidate represented her political values.
“I originally supported Rubio, and now I find myself unable to get behind Trump, similar to many other members of the Harvard Republican Club,” she wrote.
She added, “For me, voting for Johnson is a not a wasted vote, since… I believe [it] sends a message that many of us are unhappy with the major party candidates on the ballot.”
But not all club members believe Johnson is the appropriate conservative alternative to Trump.
“As far as protest votes go, Johnson is a pretty poor vehicle because he would not make for a particularly good president,” John S. Acton ’17 said.
“Of course, if I was forced to choose between Johnson, Trump, and Clinton, Johnson would probably be the best president of the three,” he added.
Instead, Acton said he was supporting independent presidential candidate D. Evan McMullin, who Acton said he saw as the “only conservative on the ballot.”
Garvey said the Republican Club is happy to see such conversation about the presidential elections within the club, even as the club itself is focusing on down-ballot races.
“I think the HRC really stands by a concept of big-tent conservatism, in which we’re able to look at different issues with all different types of viewpoints,” Garvey said.
Although the Republican Club is not supporting any presidential candidate through official club events, it still communicates with various conservative campaigns to pass along information to interested club members, Garvey said.
As an example, Garvey mentioned that the club had previously been in touch with both the Johnson campaign and a super PAC supporting the Libertarian candidate.
Before the semester began, Johnson and his vice presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Governor William F. Weld ’66, held a rally on Boston Common, which several Republican Club members attended.
“It was certainly not an official HRC event in support of the Johnson campaign, but the club is glad to connect students,” Garvey said.
O’Brien, who attended the rally, said she plans to participate in phone banks for Johnson with the Harvard Libertarian Forum.

UPDATED: October 6, 2016, at 3:59 p.m.
The School of Public Health began phasing out its Doctor of Science in favor of a new Ph.D., with 39 students matriculating in the program this fall.
Last spring, HSPH announced it partnered with the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and would scrap five S.D. programs—Epidemiology, Environmental Health, Global Health and Population, Nutrition, and Social and Behavioral Sciences—in favor of a unified Ph.D. in Population Health Sciences.
When GSAS partners with another graduate school to create a Ph.D. program, the school where the program is based determines benefits and financial aid packages. In all cases, new students for the first two years receive a full tuition grant, health insurance coverage, and a 10-month living expense stipend, which is $26,490 for students in the Population Health Sciences program.
But S.D. students already enrolled in the school will not be switched into the new Ph.D. program. Ordinarily, S.D. students are responsible for covering their own tuition and health insurance costs, and do not receive a stipend.
According to an email from HSPH spokesperson Todd Datz, the school is introducing new benefits for S.D. students to “make the support for S.D. and Ph.D. students closer to parity.”
Beginning this year, Datz wrote, all S.D. students will receive full tuition through their fifth year. The School will also fully cover health insurance and the University health fee, and provide subsidized T passes. This year, the school will also cover the facilities fee. However, the stipend that Ph.D. students receive is not included in the improved benefits package for S.D. students.
S.D. student Justin M. Feldman said last semester that the divide between Ph.D. and S.D. students could potentially create animosity. But now that the new Ph.D. students are on campus, he said tension “hasn’t really come into play yet.”
“They’re putting this Ph.D. program together still,” Feldman said. “There’s actually still ambiguity around what [Ph.D. student] TA and RA requirements will be.”
Feldman said he has not hear much about what the teaching and research assistant requirements for the new Ph.D. students will be like. Ph.D. and S.D. students perform similar work, but teaching is a key component of Ph.D. programs.
“You have a new cohort of students who are required to TA, pushing out students who have seniority and experience in those positions,” Feldman said. “So I don’t know what will happen with that, and the same goes for research.”
School of Public Health professor S. V. Subramanian, the director of the new program, wrote in an email that administrators are still discussing how to handle teaching requirements.
“We are discussing this and want to be thoughtful and comprehensive in coming up with a proposal and want to ensure we have the right inputs,” Subramanian wrote.
Adjani Peralta, a first year student in the new Ph.D. program, said that while the program is still a work in progress, students will be required to teach. Peralta added that she is pleased with the communication between administrators and the new cohort; students meet with administrators monthly and can discuss issues then.
“I do feel like they are listening to us,” Peralta said.
Peralta said if HSPH had not offered this new unified program, she would have applied for the Ph.D. in Biological and Biomedical Sciences offered jointly between the Medical School and GSAS.
The School of Education went through a similar process as HSPH in the fall of 2014, when it began phasing out its Doctor of Education and enrolled its first class of Ph.D. students.
Ed.D. student Joseph C. McIntyre said he was largely unaffected during the transition process that first year, but added that his peers were “a little bit upset” because they worried the Graduate School of Education’s offering of a Ph.D. would devalue their doctorate.
The funding disparities between Ph.D. and non-Ph.D. doctoral students have been a key concern for members of the graduate student unionization effort. McIntyre co-authored a Crimson editorial last month about the “piecemeal approach” to funding across Harvard’s graduate schools.
Feldman, who is also involved in the graduate student effort to create a union, said he and his fellow S.D. students at HSPH hope the administration continues to improve equity between the doctorates.

They receive $26,490, not $27,600.

Dozens of students gathered at the Kennedy School of Government Monday to unveil a new art display celebrating students' Hispanic heritage.
The Latinx Caucus, a Latino student organization at the Kennedy School, hosted a reception for the unveiling of “Aquí Estamos,” a new art exhibit honoring National Hispanic Heritage Month.
The exhibit, which was revealed at the reception, featured the photos and personal narratives of Latino students at the Kennedy School. The artwork will be on display until Oct. 15.
The exhibit marks the first time that the Latinx Caucus has worked on a project of this kind, according to Hiram J. Rios Hernandez, chair of the Latinx Caucus.
“We wanted to do something to honor National Hispanic Heritage Month,” Hernandez said. “We wanted to do something a bit more personal.”
During the reception, attendees shared poems, videos, and stories exploring their experiences being Latino. Five students whose photos and narratives were featured in the artwork spoke on a panel about their Hispanic heritage.
Jenina S. Soto, a first-year student at the Kennedy School who is of Puerto Rican and Filipino descent, had her writing displayed in the art exhibit. She wrote about being biracial and discovering her sense of community.
“This is who I am. I’m American. I am a woman. I am a classmate,” Soto said during an interview.
Others who were not on the panel attended the reception to show support. Rachel A. Estrada, a Kennedy School student, said the unveiling was a way to meet fellow Latino students because she said she feels there are few Latinos on Harvard’s campus.
“As a Latina, it’s important to me to support events on campus that highlight the Latino community,” Estrada said.
According to Hernandez, the Latinx Caucus is the leading organization at the Kennedy School for Latino students, covering a wide range of issues relating to the Latino community. The “x” in Latinx seeks to reflect a gender-neutral name, he added.
Overall, both the reception and the exhibit highlighted themes of diversity and inclusivity.
“We are not a race, we are an ethnicity,” Hernandez said. “We have white, black, indigenous, you name it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She may not be paying a $5 cover charge at the door, but University President Drew G. Faust is funding undergraduate social events for the second year in a row.
While the Undergraduate Council or the College Dean’s Office typically fund events for undergraduates, Faust’s contribution from her discretionary fund highlights a focus on the College’s social life as administrators place new scrutiny on where and how undergraduates party.
In an interview last week, Faust said she was funding a “more extensive program” this year, after also contributing a “generous amount” in 2015. Faust said she wanted “to support the effort to generate opportunities for students to interact outside the single gender social organizations,” and was “pleased” to contribute funds towards this effort. 
While University spokesperson David J. Cameron confirmed Faust’s funding this year marked an increase from last year’s level, he did not respond directly to a question about the size of the allocation or what events it would specifically fund. The Office of the President funded this year’s [BLANK] Party, and Cameron wrote in an email that the “President’s Office fully supports the Office of Student Life’s efforts.”
The [BLANK] Party, which ran this year for the second time, is an event that women’s groups at the College organize as a more inclusive and label-free party open to all undergraduates.
The Office of Student Life is also preparing to host a series of events geared towards re-centering the undergraduate social experience on campus; the office recently unveiled a slate of activities for undergraduates. Alex R. Miller, the College’s assistant dean for social life, wrote in an email to College students in late September that the OSL plans to hold a “fall festival” this weekend, as well as a Halloween party and several events ahead of the annual Harvard-Yale football game.
Faust’s funding comes at a time when Harvard is increasing the amount of money it spends on student life. Since the fall of 2014, the College Dean’s Office has increased funding for undergraduate social activities by a total of 73 percent. And compared to last year, the OSL’s budget for the 2016-2017 academic year increased by 15 percent.
The promotion of Harvard-sponsored socializing comes as the University also cracks down on unrecognized single gender social groups, with historic sanctions announced last spring. Beginning with the Class of 2021 who are members of unrecognized sororities, final clubs, and fraternities will be ineligible for leadership positions in campus groups, captaincies on varsity teams, or College-endorsed fellowships.
“This is really high priority for us, and it’s been a high priority for us for the past couple of years, and it will continue to be our priority,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said of promoting social events open to all College students in an interview last month. “What I think we’re doing is working in partnership with our students to hear about the kind of social life that many students say they want to advance.”
The College’s new Dean of Students Katherine O’Dair, meanwhile, said she plans to take a more hands-off approach to students’ social lives, adding that she hopes to provide resources for parties and then “get out of the way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After another fruitless bargaining session between Harvard and its dining service workers, a strike seems imminent.
“Things are not going well,” Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union that represents the dining workers—said in an interview Monday night. He added that he is not optimistic that a settlement will be reached at the final scheduled negotiation session on Tuesday, the last chance the parties have to avert a strike.
At the 18th bargaining session Monday, Harvard made a series of new offers to the HUDS bargaining unit, including paid summer stipends for workers and a new health care option for employees who make less than $55,000. Local 26 rejected all offers. 
Harvard and HUDS have been bargaining for nearly four months, a process protracted by fervent debates over the union’s health care plan and wages. Last Friday, Local 26 announced that the union would strike this Wednesday if a contract settlement was not reached by midnight Tuesday.
Marilyn Hausammann, the University’s vice president of human resources, outlined a “further enhanced” proposal that Harvard’s bargaining unit put on the table Monday to address union concerns, according to an email she sent to Harvard administrative deans. A federal mediator was present to facilitate the talks.
The University’s new proposal offers “summer stipends” to directly address a union demand that HUDS workers be provided with year-round work. According to the email, Harvard would pay dining staff who are available to work during the summer anywhere between $150 to $250 per week, “even if there are no open shifts,” depending how long the University has employed a worker.
Harvard’s dining workers do not work during the University’s recesses, a point of debate during this round of contract talks. According to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, HUDS has demanded that Harvard provide year-round work to interested employees and institute a “$35,000 minimum guaranteed salary” for those employees.
In addition to the summer stipends, Harvard extended two health care options to the union on Monday. The first would create a premium contribution tier for workers earning $55,000 or less annually in which Harvard would contribute 87 percent of the premium of the lowest-cost plan, as well as fund a “flexible savings account” of $80 per year in 2018 and 2019, and $40 in 2020. These proposed changes would not be implemented until 2018, according to the email.
In the second new health care option, the University would contribute the “equivalent cost of the Harvard University Group Health Plan enrollment premium” to a health insurance plan offered by Local 26. According to Hausammann, approximately 300 dining workers are currently enrolled in that coverage.
The average salary of a dining worker, according to the University, is about $34,000. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics—a federal organization that aggregates labor data per profession—from May 2015 indicates that the annual mean wage for food preparation and serving-related occupations in the Boston metropolitan area was $27,690.
When asked what proposals the union had raised at the session on Monday, Lang declined to comment beyond acknowledging that “concepts” had been “kicked around.” Lang criticized the University for being “disingenuous” in its negotiation tactics.
Thus far, union officials have not described in detail the proposals they have put on the bargaining table with regards to health care. They have stated they do not want their workers to pay any more out-of-pocket expenses for health care.
With the deadline for a strike set for midnight Tuesday, the union has already begun preparing to picket.
In a press release Monday afternoon, Ten Eyck detailed a series of preparations HUDS workers will make for the strike.
“On Tuesday afternoon, workers will assemble hundreds of picket signs, review strike assignments, and load strike supplies into four 29-foot RVs that will serve as a mobile Strike Headquarters,” Ten Eyck wrote. “If a settlement is not reached, pickets will go up at 16 locations on Wednesday.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 5, 2016, at 12:50 a.m.
Harvard plans to issue more than $2.5 billion in bonds this week to refinance a portion of the billions of dollars the University borrowed after financial markets crashed in 2008, prompting credit rating agencies to reaffirm Harvard’s AAA status as a borrower despite “muted investment performance.”
University leaders are selling bonds at the same time that they are deciding how to best buy securities from large financial institutions. In fiscal year 2016, Harvard’s endowment shrank from a value of $37.6 billion to $35.7 billion, a drop that University President Drew G. Faust said will affect budgets across Harvard.
Although the almost $2 billion decrease in the value of Harvard’s endowment has not yet affected the University’s ability to borrow, Moody’s bond rating agency cautioned that further investment losses could crimp Harvard’s creditworthiness.
“Credit challenges include a heavy budgetary reliance on endowment spending in the face of more muted investment performance, significant investment complexity requiring close oversight, and high financial leverage,” read the Moody’s report.
After the financial crisis, Harvard faced a liquidity crisis and was forced to issue around $2.5 billion in bonds over the 2009 fiscal year, increasing its total debt to more than $6 billion. The University decreased its debt holdings slightly over the next six years, but still owes around $5.2 billion, according to Moody’s.
Harvard is expected to issue both preliminary tax-exempt bonds worth roughly $1.54 billion through the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency, and preliminary tax-liable bonds worth about $980 million. The bonds will refinance standing debts, a move Alan Schankel—a municipal bond strategist at Janney Capital Markets—said is a sound one.
“These $2.5 billion in loans will actually improve Harvard’s financial position, since most of the proceeds will be used to refund a like amount of outstanding debt,” Schankel said.
While the recent performance of Harvard’s enormous investment portfolio has been underwhelming, its fundraising success has buoyed its financial prospects. The University has raised over $7 billion in its ongoing capital campaign, which will conclude in 2018.

This article has been updated to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: October 5, 2016
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard has issued more than $2.5 billion in bonds last week. In fact, they will issue the bonds later this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College has requested Harvard police investigate an email sent to some undergraduates urging them to stop “white genocide” and vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald J. Trump.
The email, sent Sunday with the subject line “Fight White Genocide - Vote Trump!,” claims that “third-world non-Whites” are flooding countries like the United States, and that white people should advocate against diversity. The email concludes with a plea for recipients to vote for Trump, who, the email argues, is the only candidate capable of understanding issues facing white people.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said the College has called for an official Harvard University Police Department investigation into the email. As of Monday night, the College had not received any reports of incidents of bias regarding the email.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to requests for comment on whether the police indeed were investigating.
The email was sent to several student leaders, including House Committee chairs and representatives of the Harvard Democrats and the Harvard Republicans.
The email was signed by Educators and Students Against White Genocide, a website that seeks to organize students to oppose diversity in America. According to the group’s website, a similar email was sent to University of West Virginia students and to the West Virginia state legislature.
In a Sept. 22 blog post on its website, the group called for students and staff with access to email addresses of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton affiliates. The post includes a photo of Harvard’s Matthews Hall, a freshman dormitory.
Students who received the email said they were largely not offended, though they were confused. The College emails of many students who received the message are publicly available on the Internet.
Susan X. Wang ’17, president of the Harvard Democrats, received the message on her College email account and immediately archived it, originally thinking the message was sent to her club email.
“It was pretty gross, but I didn’t see anything that was personally targeted to me, so I brushed it under the rug,” Wang said.
Similarly, when Anna Liu ’18 received the email, she thought it was spam. Waverley Y. He ’18 thought the email was satire. She also said the email was also sent to at least one alumnus of the College.
The Sept. 22 blog post includes a template for an email to send to different universities. The email students received followed that template and specifically referenced Harvard, reading that “Harvard professors say they're anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.”
At Harvard, a generally liberal campus, the campus largely leans toward Trump’s Democratic opponent. In a survey of the College’s Class of 2020, roughly 80 percent of respondents said they plan to vote for Hillary R. Clinton in November’s election, compared to only six percent for Trump. In addition, only 12 percent of the Harvard Republican Club members support Trump, according to a recent straw poll.
This summer, the Harvard College Republicans refused to endorse Trump’s candidacy, writing that a Trump presidency would be “a threat to the survival of the Republic,” and that the group could not support the candidate’s “vitriolic rhetoric.”
Last year, students and administrators expressed concern over a Facebook group advertising a ‘white student union’ at Harvard. The group claimed to “defend the inherent rights of White Europeans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past two years, the Harvard women’s volleyball team has dug itself into early-season holes, only to go on to win a share of the Ivy League championship both times.
It’s not necessarily the best strategy to rely on. But, in order grab the throne yet again, the team will have to do the same once more.
The Crimson (3-9, 1-2 Ivy) lost both contests on its Mid-Atlantic road trip, falling to both Princeton (9-3, 3-0) and Penn (7-8, 2-1) to begin the conference season with two losses in its first three games.
“I think we weren’t as consistent as we needed to be and not as mentally tough,” freshman Maclaine Fields said. “This week gave us a really good wake-up call.”
PENN 3, HARVARD 1
With the Crimson and the Quakers having split the first two sets, the third set commenced with teams trading points early. However, after Harvard took a slight 9-6 lead, Penn grabbed 10 of the next 11 points, shooting out to a six-point lead behind two services aces from Sydney Morton and two kills from Caroline Furrer, who led Penn with 14 kills.
From that moment, the Quakers would not let up, taking the third and fourth sets to clinch the match and hand the Crimson its second loss of the weekend.
“We came out in the second set and played very strongly,” Fields said. “I think that was a good sign of how our team can play. I just don’t think our mental game was on that night.”
Penn’s relative error-free offense proved to be an advantage on the night. The Quakers only registered six in the four-set tilt, compared to Harvard’s 21.
Junior Paige Kebe, who is third on the team in kills per set, was out of commission on the weekend due to an injury sustained in practice.
“This week I’ll be focusing on rehab and contributing in any way possible, regardless of whether or not I’m able to play,” Kebe said.
Compared to previous matches, co-captain Corie Bain took a much more pronounced offensive role, recording 21 kills on the night. Her previous high this year was seven in the season opener against Siena. Three other Crimson players—freshmen Grace Roberts Burbank and Fields, along with sophomore Christina Cornelius—recorded double-digit kills.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 0
Last November, Harvard defeated Princeton in the Ivy League tiebreaker, placing a permanent blockade on the Tigers’ path to the 2015 NCAA Tournament.
But this year, Princeton returned the favor, sweeping the Crimson to make its path to a three-peat all the more difficult.
The teams came out of the gates even in Dillon Gymnasium, both sitting at 15 points apiece halfway through the first set. But the Tigers would rip off a 10-5 run, capped off by back-to-back kills from Maggie O’Connell.
From there, the Tigers rolled through the next two sets, holding Harvard to 11 and 20 points in the second and third sets, respectively. The Tigers, now undefeated, sit alongside Columbia at the top of the Ivy League.
Last year’s Ivy League Player of the Year Cara Mattaliano led Princeton with 12 kills on 34 attacks after notching 22 in last year’s season finale in a losing effort. Grace Roberts Burbank led the Crimson with 13 kills, while Cornelius was the only other Harvard player to record more than five on the night.
“It [was] hard not having [Kebe],” Fields said. “But we also have a team with a lot of depth. And so was very happy with how people stepped in. We knew going into it that whoever we put onto the court could fill in and do great.”
With the two losses, the Crimson ends the second weekend of the Ancient Eight slate tied for fifth.
Starting with two losses in its first three Ivy League games is not completely foreign territory for Harvard. In 2014, Harvard found itself in the same position before winning 11 straight contests to sit atop of the Ancient Eight standings alongside Yale at season’s end.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Two minutes into last Friday night’s showdown between Harvard football and Georgetown, halfback Anthony Firkser lined up to the left of the offensive line.
When the ball snapped, the senior shot off, cut to the left, and snatched a bullet from senior quarterback Joe Viviano. Then he turned up field, where a defensive back was waiting.
At this point, Firkser could have sidestepped the tackle and headed out of bounds, picking up a few yards in the process. He could have ducked inside, avoiding the brunt of impact.
Instead, he steamed ahead, sending the would-be tackler reeling. The hit echoed across the field and energized the Crimson sideline. Just as loud was the underlying message: Few people can stop senior halfback Anthony Firkser when he has the ball in his hands.
On Friday night, Firkser only held the pigskin five times, but he made the most of those touches. He racked up 147 receiving yards and two touchdowns, including a 75-yard dash through the Hoyas defense. Overall he has averaged 21 yards per grab through three contests, which might seem preposterous if not for the fact that he’s averaged 15.2 and 16.9 yards per catch during the last two seasons, respectively.
Firkser’s highlight of the evening came early in the second quarter, with Harvard facing a second-and-nine from its own 25. On a post route, the senior burst past his man and corralled the ball near midfield. At that point, the race was over: the halfback beat everyone to the end zone, giving the Crimson a 21-7 lead.
“When you come up here and play a really good football team at their place, you can’t make the mistakes that we did,” Georgetown coach Rob Sgarlata said. “[That play] was tough.”
Harvard particularly needed this production on a night when star receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley didn’t see game action. In his absence, the Crimson trotted out a three-man receiving corps of sophomore Brian Dunlap, junior Jake Barann, and senior Joseph Foster.
Heading into the contest, these three players had racked up 316 total yards over the course of their careers; by comparison, Shelton-Mosley had racked up 265 yards in the course of two games this year.
“You know you’re going to have adversity,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’ve had probably an inordinate amount of adversity so far this year, but we’ve done a good job finding guys that can step up and play.”
If any fears remained, Firkser allayed them in the first half. He finished the first two quarters with four catches, 134 yards, and two touchdowns.
The first of those scores came with just under nine minutes left in the opening quarter. Viviano snapped the ball from the Georgetown 11 and waited behind impervious pass protection until Firkser came free across the back of the end zone. Crimson 14, Hoyas 0.
Yet Firkser’s most athletic feat of the day didn’t go for a touchdown. Late in the first quarter, with Harvard staring down a third-and-long, Viviano opted to loft a 34-yard pass down the sideline, where Firkser and Georgetown captain David Akere were running stride for stride. Both players leapt up, but only Firkser came down with the ball.
That leaping display hinted at the halfback’s versatility. Murphy likes to recruit players that are “slashers”—a mold of both running back and wide receiver. Seitu Smith and Andrew Fischer—the veteran leaders of last season’s receiving corps—both fit this model.
Firkser is a different kind of slasher. At Manalaplan High School in Englishtown, N.J., he played wide receiver, setting school records in every major receiving category. At Harvard, however, he has transitioned to a more physical halfback role.
This position shift creates fits for opposing defenses. As a former wideout, Firkser is too quick for linebackers to cover; as a 230-pound tight end, he’s too strong for cornerbacks to manhandle.
Firkser is no stranger to straddling two different roles. Besides dominating on the gridiron, he also starred at point guard for the Manalapan basketball team, tallying over 1,000 points and twice serving as team captain.
By the time that college came into focus, the operative question was not whether Firkser would play a Division I sport, but rather which sport he would play. Dartmouth and Yale pursued the standout for both basketball and football; Boston College, Connecticut, Colgate, and several others expressed interest for football.
The Crimson took a compromise approach, recruiting Firkser for football but leaving open the possibility of walking onto the basketball team. Eventually that marketing hooked Firkser. And despite persistent thoughts of walking onto the basketball team, the freshman settled on football alone.
Perhaps Firkser still has doubts about that decision. But years later, after 70 receptions and 1,193 receiving yards, Harvard football surely has none.

HUDS workers are set to strike this Wednesday should they not reach an agreement with the University, meaning the comfort of unlimited swipes and friendly faces in our dining halls (shoutout to John) may disappear indefinitely. Who knows how long it could take Harvard to find adequate funds for its workers from that thirty-seven billion dollar endowment? 
First no light, now no food: we’re sensing a clear downward trend in the basic living needs department. The end could be nigh, so here’s Flyby’s survival guide for outlasting a HUDS apocalypse.
Take PrecautionsYou must forage for provisions in advance. To properly stock up, enter the dhall on Monday with a savage mindset, and proceed with your overt theft like nobody's watching. With Tupperware poised, confidently ladle oatmeal, chili, and chowder. Fill designated containers to the brim with cookies and your cereal of choice. You’ll also want to load up on condiments to spice up those Nutrigrain bars that have been under your bed since move-in. An entire bottle of chocolate syrup and can of whipped cream should do the trick. Finish off by stuffing your backpack with 30 apples. Just squirrel those babies away, you could be in this for the long haul!
Desperate Times, Desperate MeasuresThe quest for free food begins. Employing activities-fair level determination, scrutinize club emails for beacons like “free Felipe’s” and follow the Harvard Today food watch with a keen eye. Speaking of guilt-free mooching, give your parents a call. Be sure to sound extra meager and whine for a care package of snacks. Or try groveling to admin. Seeing as they’re in loco parentis and the stubborn cause of the strike, fight the man and demand a refund of the daily cost of meals, $36 (who knew it was this much?!). Just imagine four Chipotle burrito bowls a day, and life without HUDS seems a little more sufferable.
Last ResortsIt’s been a few hours, days, weeks, and it’s time to put those FOP endurance skills in place. Forget drinking your own pee, lick John Harvard’s foot for sustenance. This could be a problematic strategy once it gets cold, but it would certainly make a statement to Faust. Stay hungry, kids.

Tatte, we’re so glad you’re here. Perfect timing with the opening, too. With an indefinitely long HUDS strike imminent and frozen food as our likely only offered option, you can bet on a flood of Harvard students coming your way.
With the sudden closing of Panera Bread this past February, we at Flyby realized that everything was going to hell. No more cozy bakery-cafes in the Square? Where on earth were we supposed to eat when Marshmallow Mateys from brain break just weren’t cutting it?
Tatte’s long awaited opening has answered our prayers. The beloved bakery-cafe concept has returned to Harvard Square, and it’s better than ever. We went to check it out for this review, but mostly to add some artsy vibes to our Snapchat stories and approximately 6 new food snaps for the Insta.
Menu 
 Obviously, Tatte is a bakery-cafe, so their food offerings should be the most important part. Luckily, Tatte’s baked goods are the most Insta-presentable foods we’ve ever seen. They’re also pretty delicious.
The fluffy pastries stacked against the counter call out to those with a sweet tooth or a carb craving. On the menu, Tatte has typical cafe options spanning different types of sandwiches and salads. Their breakfast and brunch offerings are delicious as well, with plenty of options to satisfy both the indulgent sweet-loving customer and your health-conscious blockmate who will only eat salads and oatmeal.
The only downside are the prices on some of these items. Ten dollars for an egg and avocado tartine? Eating at this place could get pricey if you’re not careful.
The CoffeeAs self-proclaimed coffee aficionados, we have been absolutely itching for a good coffee joint around these parts of town. There are a few places around the Square that have pretty good coffee—Crema and Darwin’s come to mind—but let’s be honest, those places aren’t all that instagrammable.
Luckily, Tatte coffee is probably the best coffee we’ve had in Cambridge so far. The milk in my macchiato was frothed to perfection, the coffee strong yet sensual. Coffees even come with some tastefully done milk art. Added bonus, there’s something incredibly satisfying about drinking good coffee from a real mug, not some paper-plastic white cup (looking at you, Starbz and Barker).
Drink prices are more than reasonable.
InteriorForget the homey feeling of Panera, with its orange and yellow walls and suburban vibe. Tatte is chic and hip, with a crisp black-and-white aesthetic and tiled floors. The renovations scream “Insta me now to gain hipster credibility.”
While the place is likely to be quite busy on most days, there are two floors’ worth of seating options. Great place to study if you have some light reading to do.
Customer ServiceThe staff at Tatte Harvard Square were kind and accommodating, despite seeming a little frazzled figuring things out on their first day with customers. Kudos to the staff member who spent a good five minutes explaining their entire breakfast menu to a confused customer. Additional kudos to the staff member who actually got our names right on our drink orders.
The days of walking down Mass Ave. without a fresh pastry one hand and a warm coffee in the other are thankfully over. Tatte Bakery and Cafe has finally opened in Harvard Square, and it is essentially heaven on earth. Thank you for being our coffee-bearing, Instagram-saving, hipster-reaffirming hero.
