After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The scholarly expeditions undertaken by modern-day explorer and Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter will be featured in a biopic produced by actor Will Smith.
In an e-mailed statement to The Crimson, Counter said that the film is slated for release in late 2011 and will be developed by Overbrook Entertainment and Sony Pictures—both of which are declining to publicly discuss the project. Debbie Allen is also producing the film, and Farhad Safinia will be penning the script, Variety magazine reported.
Counter, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School, said he is “flattered” that Smith—the star of multiple blockbuster movies and a producer with big-name projects under his belt—will be working on the biopic, which will focus on Counter’s scientific explorations abroad.
Counter said that Debbie Allen described his character as “a mixture of Indiana Jones and Robert Langdon,” the fictional Harvard professor of symbology in Dan Brown’s novels.
Colleagues who learned that Counter’s life would be turned into a biopic emphasized the multi-faceted nature of a man who has gained the titles of neuroscience professor, humanitarian, mentor—and even the Consul General of Sweden in Boston and New England.
“Some people think that Allen Counter is one person,” said Harvard Extension School Dean Michael Shinagel, who is on a faculty advisory committee in the Harvard Foundation. “He is a combination of several workers at once.”
The biopic will reflect Counter’s numerous expeditions abroad and his deep interest in indigenous cultures. A scholar of African-American ethnography, Counter has conducted scientific research and cultural studies among the indigenous people of the Suriname South American rainforest. He has also traveled to the Andean mountains in South America and visited the indigenous people of Northwest Greenland, Ecuadorian rainforest, Suriname and South American rainforest, and tribal villages in northern Togo.
“I still live with and fight for the rights of indigenous people against those who exploit them, take their land, and destroy their culture,” Counter said. “I have always had an interest in different cultures of the world. I have always been able to live with people of different cultures, backgrounds, and religions, and gained their respect.”
“Instead of trying to teach them his ways, he’s learning from them,” said Entomology Officer of Environmental Health and Safety Gary D. Alpert, a colleague of Counter. “He’s what you would call a social anthropologist.”
The 2011 biopic will not be the first time Counter’s life and work fall before the camera. In 1978, his explorations led to the production of an award-winning documentary called “I Shall Moulder Before I Shall Be Taken,” which studied the culture and history of the indigenous rainforest people in Surinam in the 1870s. Other documentaries followed, such as “Lost Africans in the Andes” and “I Sought My Brother.”
Between 1993 and 2000, Counter led medical teams into the Ecuadorian Andes Mountains to study the health problems of indigenous children and to provide medical services. Currently, he is working to reduce the severe lead and mercury poisoning found among the children in the ceramics glazing and gold mining areas of Ecuador.
“It’s hard to name a single person who has done as much work in 30 years,” said William A. Graham, dean of the faculty at the Harvard Divinity School, about his colleague.
Nearly 30 years ago, former University President Derek C. Bok and Reverend of Christian Morals Peter J. Gomes appointed Counter to the directorship of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, which seeks to improve intercultural understanding, equality, and peace within the University by sponsoring and conducting over 200 student and faculty programs each year.
“The Foundation is very much created out of personality and dedication,” said Biology Professor David Haig, who works with Counter at the Foundation. “The unique part that he’s done is to recognize groups without allowing them to become isolated in separate centers…There is no equivalent in most other colleges.”
In addition to his scholarly work, Counter has served as a mentor for students and has taken groups on trips to Louisiana to assist his medical relief team in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and to remote areas of South America.
Counter is currently working to establish the first memorial to African-American slaves, and has been petitioning President Barack Obama about the establishment of the American Slavery Memorial on the historic Washington Mall in D.C.
“He has done it for so many years that we almost take it for granted,” Shinagel said of Counter’s work on behalf of minorities. “If and when he retires, you’ll end up having to hire six people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin captivated the basketball world with his performance on Thursday against John Wall, the No. 1 overall pick in last June's NBA draft.
Lin, a member of the Dallas Mavericks summer league team, held his own against Wall in the Mavericks’ contest against the Washington Wizards.
Wall may have outscored Lin, whose team ended up with the loss, but Lin went off in the fourth quarter, dropping 11 points off a combination of acrobatic layups, one-handed flushes, mid-range jump shots, and deep balls. He also out-jumped Wall—who boasts a 43-inch vertical leap—after the two got tied up for a jump ball.
While Lin’s performance may have surprised many observers, they may be more surprised to learn that Lin was not the first Harvard player to square off against the 2009-10 CBS Sports First Team All-American.
As a player at Hopewell High School in Huntersville, N.C., rising Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry was ranked the No. 2 point guard in his class in the Tar Heel state. The man sitting at No. 1—John Wall.
But for nearly three seasons, the two never faced off on the hardwood. That changed during the pair’s junior season when they both attended Dave Telep’s Carolina Challenge, a camp for the top 80 high school players in North Carolina. Curry wasn’t aware he was going to play against Wall until he was approached by Telep before the competition.
“[Telep] told me before the [camp] he had a special matchup for me,” Curry said.
Soon enough, Curry was matched up against one of the top five recruits from the class of 2009.
“I was so shocked at how cool he was on the court,” Curry said. “Most players with that talent are usually pretty cocky.”
But when the ball was in play, Curry started to realize other things about Wall.
“I’ve never played someone so fast before,” Curry said. “I already knew he was the real deal.”
Two years later, the two have followed drastically different paths. While Wall left Kentucky early for the NBA and has already signed a shoe deal with Reebok, Curry is trying to help the Crimson win its first Ivy League title.
As a freshman, Curry averaged 7.3 points and 3.2 assists per game—good for fourth in the Ivy League—and led the Crimson in three-point percentage, despite playing with a torn left patellar tendon and coming off the bench for more than half the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 9:09 a.m.
After an impressive round of performances in the NBA summer league, former Harvard co-captain Jeremy Lin is close to signing a deal with the Golden State Warriors, ESPN reported Tuesday night.
In an interview with The Crimson on Tuesday, the headline-making Asian American player said that he will announce his choice of team either that night or Wednesday, when the terms of the deal are closer to being finalized. When asked if his final choice would be among the Mavericks, Lakers, or an Eastern Conference team—the first three teams to reportedly offer him a deal—Lin declined to comment.
The Warriors—although not one of three original teams to offer Lin a contract—expressed interest in Lin before the 2010 NBA draft, inviting Lin to a workout at their facilities.
Lin, whose NBA stock increased dramatically due to his strong showing at this month's NBA summer league, will sign a multi-year contract and receive at least $250,000 in guaranteed money as a rookie, according to ESPN.
Many sports enthusiasts predicted that the Oakland-based Warriors would sign the Harvard graduate following June's NBA draft. But after going undrafted, Lin chose to sign on with the Dallas Mavericks' summer league roster.
After a strong showing in his first three contests with the Mavericks, Lin had reportedly received interest from three NBA teams: the Mavericks, the Los Angeles Lakers, and an Eastern Conference team.
But after Lin scored 11 fourth-quarter points in a matchup against the Washington Wizards and No. 1 overall pick John Wall, more teams came knocking.
"[The matchup with Wall] was by far the biggest thing for me in terms of my stock and everything," Lin said. "Just thank God for a perfect performance on a perfect night. There are a lot of things you can't control but I fully believe that was a blessing from God. The timing of that was unbelievable."
With more teams vying for his services, Lin and his agent, Roger Montgomery, examined several factors in determining the right fit for Lin, who will still have to fight for a final roster spot on the Warriors.
Lin said that the factors they considered included "location, contract situation, [roster size], how much they're willing to invest in me, and style of play."
The Warriors—a team with only three true guards under contract for the 2010-11 NBA season—seemed to be an ideal fit for Lin, who will still have to fight for a spot on the Warriors’ bench at the start of the upcoming season.
While Lin's rookie contract of $500,000 will reportedly be guaranteed for at least $250,000, he will still have to earn a spot on the team's final roster following the team's fall training camp and preseason.
If things do not go Lin's way this fall, the point guard could be sent to play for the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League, the Warriors' minor league affiliate.
 
“If I was playing under an NBA team I would definitely want to play in the D League [rather than play overseas],” Lin said.
Lin received attention from NBA scouts throughout his senior season at Harvard in which he averaged 16.4 points, 4.5 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.4 steals per game in leading the Crimson to its most victories in Harvard history.
But Lin’s stock began to rise at the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament—a tournament for college seniors hoping to play in the NBA—in May at which he averaged 10.3 points and 6.0 assists in three games.
Lin’s performance at the Portsmouth Invititational Tournament and his hiring of Montgomery as an agent helped him land a handful of invitations to compete in a series of workouts against other NBA hopefuls in front of scouts leading up to the 2010 NBA draft.
Lin worked out for at least eight NBA teams, including the Warriors, Lakers, and Mavericks.
Widely considered a borderline second-round pick, Lin went undrafted on June 24 but was still offered a spot on the Mavericks’ summer league roster by Mavericks’ general manager Donnie Nelson following the draft.
Lin’s performance at the NBA Summer League, held in Las Vegas from July 9-18, increased his exposure to NBA scouts and fans alike. In his five games with the Mavericks, Lin came off the bench and averaged 9.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 1.2 steals in 19 minutes per game.
“I thought the summer league went well and I was able to show my game and be effective,” Lin said. “Overall it helped my stock tremendously. I am definitely happy with how it went.”
While the six-foot-three point guard drew interest from a handful of NBA teams after averaging 8.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.0 assists over the course of the Mavericks’ first three contests, it was Lin’s matchup with Wall that put Lin on every team’s radar.
In the fourth quarter alone, Lin scored 11 points off a series of long balls, dunks, mid-range jump shots, and acrobatic layups. Defensively, Lin forced Wall into taking bad shots and even out jumped the player with a reported 43-inch vertical leap on a jump ball.
But while Lin’s battle with Wall may have proved to scouts, coaches, and fans that he was able to take his game to the next level, Lin does not feel like there was a single moment that made himself believe he was ready for the NBA.
“I think it’s been a gradual process,” Lin said. “Going in I was pretty confident and everything but the more workouts I did and more games I played, I continued to get more and more confident. It wasn’t really one specific moment.”
After Lin concluded the summer league with a 12-point, five-rebound performance, his stock was at a new high. Sources first indicated that the defending-champion Lakers were interested in signing Lin to backup guards Derek Fisher and Kobe Bryant, but it now looks like Lin will be heading be heading to northern California to play for his hometown Warriors.
Golden State is led at the guard position by Monta Elli and Stephen Curry—both of whom averaged over 17 points per game last season—but lacks much depth beyond the pair. Charlie Bell—who has averaged less than 10 points per game throughout his six year NBA career—is the only other true guard signed by the Warriors for the coming season.
By signing with the Warriors, Lin—who is of Taiwanese descent—will move one step closer to becoming just the fourth Asian American to play in the NBA.
Wataru Misaka, a Japanese American born in Utah, was the first Asian American to play in the NBA, as he played in three games for the New York Knicks during the 1947-1948 season. The half-Filipino Raymond Townsend from California was selected in the first round by the Warriors in the 1978 NBA draft. Townsend played in 154 games from 1978 to 1982 and averaged 4.8 points per game.
The most recent Asian American to play in the NBA was the half-Japanese Rex Walters. Walters played in 335 NBA games from 1993 to 2000 with the New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, and Miami Heat during which time he averaged 4.6 points per game.

Harvard is never quite the same once you actually become a student here. Before you commence those four years spent face-down on the wooden desks of Lamont in despair, you think that a lot of things about Harvard are pretty cool. Like the chemically-enhanced green grass in the Yard. The buildings that look old enough to have housed tea parties for John Harvard himself. The classes, the professors, the glamour of academia—everything. Name one thing about Harvard, and it'll send an ambitious high schooler into a tizzy.
We took a stroll with Anthony R. Lafontant, a rising junior in high school and a current student in the Summer School Program, to get his take on Harvard as a fresh-faced non-undergraduate. The takeaway lesson: There's really nothing quite as beautiful as Harvard when you're in high school. Dream on, kids, dream on.
