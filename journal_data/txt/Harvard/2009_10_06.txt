After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Roman Polanski saga has played out like something out of a Polanski movie. His misdeeds of decades past have followed him to the present day in a strange fashion. Despite the assertions by L.A. prosecutors to the contrary, it is likely that, had Polanski’s case not been such a high-profile one, the pursuit of this beleaguered film director would have ended a long time ago. His extradition and arrest do not represent a glorious triumph for the administration of justice everywhere; the Polanski case was hardly an example of finesse and swiftly administered justice. Indeed, Polanski’s victim, Samantha Geimer, has publicly stated that she has come to terms with her abuse and does not wish to see the case pursued.
But none of this changes the fact that Roman Polanski drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl. Polanski did not allow himself to be properly sentenced for this crime, instead choosing to flee the country on the fear that his transgression would be met with a prison sentence. Justice was never served, and it does not have an expiration date. The administration of justice may be 30 years late and may only be taking place now because of Polanski’s celebrity, but this is merely a reflection of the unfortunate fact that not everyone who escapes justice is punished, not proof that people who escape justice for long enough should be rewarded. Nor should justice pander to peculiar circumstances or Academy Awards. The fact that Roman Polanski is an acclaimed movie director who gave people cinematic masterpieces like “Rosemary’s Baby” does not exonerate him, and any defense of Polanski that is predicated on his artistic gifts is terribly misguided.
From a broad perspective, little may be accomplished by jailing Polanski—his victim has expressed no desire to see Polanski punished, the arrest comes decades after the fact, and Polanski has by all known accounts not committed any other transgressions. But the idea that this man should be given a free pass simply because he is a celebrity or because his punishment is overdue is offensive to the idea that all individuals are to be treated as equals under the law. Roman Polanski’s life has been difficult and his achievements great, but he should have no asylum from justice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Harry Potter series, the character Hermione decides to get even when the muckraking Daily Prophet columnist Rita Skeeter starts harassing her and her Hogwarts friends.
And now, thanks to the sensationalism of The New York Post, it would seem that the entire Muggle world is aglow with a real-life version of the same story: the innocent Emma Watson, Hermione’s real-life alter ego, terrorized by a wicked publication—in this case, The Harvard Voice.
According to the Post article “Harvard Jerks Stalked Emma,” Watson, the Brown University freshman and starlet of Harry Potter fame, came to Cambridge for the Harvard-Brown football game September 25 only to be “stalked” by members of The Voice, who updated a blog with pictures and her whereabouts throughout the game. Unfortunately, media organizations such as The Post have been unable to understand that The Voice is a humor-leaning student-life magazine and that there is a distinction between satire and a true violation of journalistic ethics.
Did Harvard “jerks” really ruin Emma Watson’s evening?
A student-life humor magazine poked fun at this country’s fascination with celebrities, and a celebrity who made a clear, conscious decision to participate in this public activity had to deal with paparazzi. Somehow, this does not seem out of the ordinary or at all egregious.
Of course, that The New York Post of all publications is the one to have accused The Voice of “stalking” is deliciously ironic. One would think that the same publication that prides itself on gossip—especially celebrity gossip—would be proud of The Voice, not incensed. After all, it was The Post that sent reporters to stalk the humiliated Ruth Madoff on the Manhattan subway, photographers to capture her at the worst possible moments, and writers to transcribe every last angry word she said as she tried to escape their questions. We find The Post’s implicit condemnation of The Voice’s actions to be as hypocritical as we do amusing.
Perhaps the most unsettling aspect, however, to the entire Emma Watson “debacle” is the allegation that The Voice harassed her in any serious way or that it contributed to her discomfort. Surely, those updating The Voice’s blog or tweeting during the game were not the first to fawn over the actress, who would turn heads from Los Angeles to Dubai. Their actions were harmless, meant in an unfortunately misunderstood satirical manner, and were devoid of the mean-spirited motives that often define celebrity journalism.
That said, we do not wish Harvard’s reputation to be tarnished more than it already has been in the unfortunate aftermath of this overblown spectacle. Should Watson return to Harvard for future games or other activities, we hope that she finds the welcome environment we know and love. And at least at Harvard, no one has to worry about those nosy reporters from the Prophet or the Quibbler.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the Obama campaign, there was always one big donkey in the room: What if he actually can’t—or doesn’t—bring about change we can believe in?
This wasn’t something his legion of supporters—myself included—liked to talk about. Publicly, we were all “fired up and ready to go.” As I often joked during the campaign, I didn’t just drink the Kool-Aid, I made the Kool-Aid.
There were good reasons for this. After eight years of fear-mongering and war-hawking, many of us were ready for something—anything—different. But it was more than simply anger and exasperation that drove us to the polls. Barack Obama gave us a reason to vote for him, rather than just another lame excuse to vote against them. We were taken by his formidable intellect and his youthful energy. We were interested in his story, inspired by his eloquence, and impressed with his honesty. Older generations who had endured the stinging insults of racism found in him cause for hope that their deferred dreams might finally be realized. And people my age—young enough to still care but old enough to be angry—were grateful for the chance to believe in something again.
That was then.
It’s been almost a year since that historic election, and our hope has lost some of its audacity. With troops still on the ground and uncertainty still in the air, war in Iraq presses on with no end in sight and a daily price tag well into the millions. And now, President Obama is preparing to ramp up the “good war” in Afghanistan. The United States hasn’t won a ground war in over half a century, and now one of the smartest presidents in modern American history thinks he can win two of them. One struggles in vain to find the logic in this lunacy.
Here at home, we have watched as President Obama—and his maddeningly inept Democratic majority—squander control of the national debate over health-care reform. In place of intelligent deliberation, we have ignorant demagoguery. Instead of concern and compassion for the uninsured, we hear cries of “Communism!” from the uninformed. The president tried to stop the bleeding with one of his trademark orations—this time to a joint session of Congress during prime time—but his performance only underscored the old cliché that sometimes actions are better than words.
President Obama has disappointed on other matters as well. He’s backtracked on wiretapping and stonewalled on LGBT issues. He bailed out Wall Street but failed to put stricter measures in place to regulate the unbridled greed and corruption that caused this mess in the first place. His advisors now say that closing Guantánamo won’t be so easy, and we still don’t know whether his Justice Department will actually prosecute Bush-era officials who treated the Constitution like toilet paper. Last week, things got so bad that the president couldn’t even bring the Olympics back home.
Of course, we can’t place all the blame on his shoulders. These are tough, complex times. There are no easy solutions to things like war and health care and economic recession. Moreover, President Obama hasn’t even completed one year in office. Complex issues can’t be solved overnight, and he inherited quite a mess to begin with. We should also remember that the president is just one man. In a political system that rests, ideally, on a balance of power, effective leadership requires collaboration and compromise. That said, this president is sometimes too collaborative, too willing to compromise on matters of both policy and principle. His Achilles heel is that he wants everyone to like him. Indeed, so far, Obama has failed to make the transition from the consensus politics of campaigning to the contentious politics of governing. Ultimately, his success in office will depend on it.
But Obama’s failures are also our failures, especially those of us who worked so hard to get him elected. Far too many of us equated the man with the movement, as if electing a strong candidate was the same thing as effecting social change. And far too many of us have rested on our laurels since the election, satisfied by a job well done and convinced that Obama would make the world right again. But in these troubled times, the man needs his movement back, to ensure that the change we believed in produces the world we want to live in. Obama cannot—and will not—do it without us. Real change comes from the people, not the president.
Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 is Director of the Human Rights and Social Movements Program at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a founding member of Barack Obama’s National LGBT Leadership Council.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You have to be kidding me,” a student wrote in an e-mail to Throptalk, Winthrop House’s list. The Resource Efficiency Program, an offshoot of the Office for Sustainability, had announced it was removing all but one napkin dispenser from each table in the dining hall to reduce waste. In response, some students saw red: “If I need a napkin, I’m going to use one. Now, I’m going to have to have three people touch it with their dirty hands before it gets to me,” the e-mailer griped.
Others saw green: “If you are so messy and so concerned about other people touching your napkins, stockpile a few before you sit down to eat your meal and stop whining,” another e-mailer jibed. When students objected that they had not been consulted before the decision, a third replied, “Decisions that benefit everyone don’t need to be put up to ridiculous and useless debate.”
That’s debatable. Environmentalism inconveniences people more than necessary, and this flap over napkins is the latest example.
Let’s be fair to the REP. OFS plans to limit dispensers in all dining halls eventually; Winthrop merely jumped ahead. We also have an administration that stops hot breakfast to balance budgets. It will do anything for a buck—except fire a dean. Two years ago, REP was encouraged to track temperatures in rooms for the manager of building systems so he could see which were too warm and then lower their heat—and save money. When students shivered, REP got the blame. The administration may again be using REP as a front man for its cuts.
And REP does much good. For instance, it offers students signs for their drop boxes so they can opt out of receiving flyers. It also collects lost dishware so Harvard University Dining Services does not have to buy new supplies. REP is right that waste should be a common enemy.
Unfortunately, environmentalists’ definition of “waste” is all-inclusive. If you use less of something after it becomes less convenient, you must have been using too much of it before. One example is Kirkland House, which has only a few dispensers in the entire dining hall and whose students, miraculously, use fewer napkins. The administration calls this phenomenon a decrease in waste. But students use fewer napkins because fewer napkins are available; we don’t know for certain that the change eliminated superfluous napkins.
True, the inconvenience of fewer dispensers is small, but so is the environmental impact. And this decision promotes an attitude that treats needless burdens as essential elements of conservation: trayless dining, reusable mugs, “efficient” showerheads that just spray less water.
Yes, we’re not significantly worse off for having them, but are we really better off?
The evidence suggests not. “Global warming caused by human beings is real but overblown because it has been over-forecast by our computer models,” said Patrick J. Michaels, a Distinguished Senior Fellow in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University. Richard S. Lindzen, the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, finds that the United Nations’s computer models overestimated warming roughly by a factor of three. “The warming of the twenty-first century is going to be modest and frankly there’s really not much that’s going to be done about it,” Michaels said.
But say you accept environmentalists’ position. How would their policies affect our standard of living? The American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which the House of Representatives passed in June, requires Americans to lower their carbon dioxide emissions by 83 percent below 2005 levels in 40 years. “That means when you are 61, you will be allowed the average per capita emissions of an American in 1867,” Michaels said. He added that if every country under the Kyoto treaty adopted similar measures, we would prevent just seven percent of the warming that the UN predicts will occur.
Global warming is less dire than some scientists predict, and people have less of an effect on it than they think. Must we eat without trays to avoid impeding doom? No. Motel 6 can still leave the lights on for you. And you can take that extra napkin.
Besides, if students were serious about combating global warming, they would have elected Roger G. Waite ’10 president of the Undergraduate Council last year. Waite promised to decrease our carbon footprint by using green technology—specifically, oxen. His platform sounded similar to those “Go Green” tips on the back of party registration forms.
If only he had won.

Harvard Medical School Professor of Genetics Jack W. Szostak and colleagues Elizabeth H. Blackburn and Carol W. Greider will be awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Medicine in December for their research illuminating the cell’s solution to protect its DNA, the prize committee announced yesterday.
“The discoveries by Blackburn, Greider and Szostak have added a new dimension to our understanding of the cell, shed light on disease mechanisms, and stimulated the development of potential new therapies,” said the selection committee’s statement.
Telomeres, which Szostak first described with Blackburn in a 1982 paper, are regions of repeated DNA sequences at the ends of DNA strands that protect the overall structures from degrading during replication.
The importance of telomeres in aging, cell death, cancer, and stem cells has since been proven many times in subsequent research across the scientific community.
“If you look at telomere biology, there has been three major discoveries beyond the fact that chromosomes are linear. Szostak made the first one,” said Stephen J. Elledge, an HMS professor of genetics who has researched on the link between telomeres and cancer suppression. “This prize should have been received a long time ago. Szostak’s prize is very important, and I’m glad that [the committee] got it right.”
“When we started the work, of course, we were really just interested in the very basic question about DNA replication, how the ends of chromosomes are maintained,” Szostak told The New York Times yesterday. “At the time we had no idea there would be all these later implications.”
According to Alonso Ricardo, a postdoctoral student who has worked in Szostak’s lab, news of the award was great—but also expected.
“It’s been 20 years [since the discovery of telomeres], and all the applications that out of this research is very evident,” Ricardo said. “It was about time to get the prize.”
Szostak’s lab now focuses on synthetic biology, chemical systems, and the origins of life.
“The lab really has a sense of community, and even people who worked here ten years ago called and still had a sense of pride,” said Jason P. Schrum, a graduate student in Szostak’s laboratory. “He switches directions with the times.”
Schrum added that Szostak is “a great mentor...who is always pushing us to work deeper.”
This is the first year in which two female scientists will be awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine.
Blackburn is currently a professor of biology and physiology at the University of California, San Francisco.
Greider is a professor in the department of molecular and biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

The Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to transfer authority of the Student Community Center Capital Campaign—established by the UC to raise funds for a possible student center amidst controversy last May—to the independent, undergraduate-led Student Community Center Foundation, a non-profit formed over the summer.
According to UC President Andrea R. Flores ’10, the legislation came after UC leadership and campaign leaders decided over the summer that the campaign was “not functioning well within the structure of the UC” and would be more effectively managed under an independent organization, especially given that the majority of the campaign workforce comprised non-UC members.
“There are a lot of other issues in the student body, and the UC needs to apply ourselves to those,” said Cabot House representative and social space project proponent Senan Ebrahim ’12. ”We thought that [SCCF] is optimal because it has a charter that is dedicated specifically to the [social spaces project].”
Although the legislation “suspended the campaign from the UC,” the body will continue to lend support to the campaign, Flores said.
The legislation stipulates that the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee will select at least one UC representative to serve on the SCCF Campaign Advisory Council and that the UC President or their designee will serve as a member of a proposed Center’s Board of Directors. Furthermore, the UC Student Relations Committee may assist in publicizing the SCCF’s efforts.
Some UC representatives objected to the continuing relationship between the UC and the project.
“The Student Initiatives Committee is a new committee; we are still trying to figure out what our mission is,” said Quincy House representative David Gonzalez ’11. “We don’t want to tie our hands legislatively to this.”
Flores emphasized during the meeting that the UC will no longer be responsible for managing the campaign or dedicating resources to the campaign.
“[This is] our way of officially co-sponsoring [the campaign],” she said, “This is something that people on both sides of the original [debate] feel is good, not just for the UC but also for students.”
Student Community Center Campaign leader Joshua J. Nuni ’10 believes that relationship between the UC and SCCF will be mutually beneficial.
“Being part of an independent center is going to change the culture of the UC in a good way,” he said.
The SCCF has drafted an extensive discussion draft explaining the current status and future plans for the campaign. According to Nuni, the campaign has already made significant progress towards the acquisition of property for the center, which is “the most difficult step.” He estimates that the campaign could know within a month about the prospects of purchasing 45 Mt. Auburn St., which is the campaign’s primary property target.
The document also outlines the Foundation’s vision for the student center, which proposes space for arts as well as intellectual and social programming. The center will be student-run, with a Board of Directors composed of students, alumni, and potentially a member of the administration.
“We want to create a space that is social but substantive,” Nuni said.
During the meeting, the UC also affirmed its financial sponsorship of the DAPA grants program, which lost its funding from the administration last year due to budget cuts, according to DAPA grants chair Siri F.A. Uotila ’10.
The UC will give $5,000 to DAPA to continue the program this semester.

Neal A. Baer, executive producer of NBC’s “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit” endorsed the power of stories in a talk yesterday, calling narratives “the currency of our lives” before an audience in Radcliffe Yard’s Longfellow Hall.
“Our brains are wired for storytelling,” Baer said at the event, entitled “Telling Tales: How Stories Can Make a Difference.” “They encapsulate our fears, failures, dreams, and desires. They are the touchstones for our emotions.”
He noted the importance of stories as a means to “cut through the noise” and make sense of the mass of information available in an increasingly technological and interconnected society.
Baer—who holds three graduate degrees from Harvard, including an M.D.—stressed the media’s ability to facilitate social change, primarily focusing on his experience with television as a means to educate viewers.
The executive producer of the popular medical drama “ER” before leaving for Law & Order in 2001, Baer periodically presented video clips from both shows to help him illustrate his points.
At one such juncture, he screened scenes from a 1999 ER episode that told the story of a high school girl’s discovery that she had acquired  human papillomavirus (HPV).
From a polling of regular ER viewers, nine percent of those surveyed could correctly define HPV before the show’s airing compared to 28 percent one week after its debut, Baer said. He added that, according to his figures, one in seven viewers contacted a healthcare provider in response to the show’s content.
“People learn in spite of themselves,” Baer said. “We don’t tell people specifically they are going to learn something when they watch our shows, but they end up doing so anyway.”
Forum-attendee and Graduate School of Education graduate student Victoria Chao agreed that stories could have educational potential in an interview after the talk.
“Stories are powerful in way that statistics aren’t,” she said.  “If you get down to the individual level of a character in a TV show, it’s easier to  become more sympathetic to an issue that you weren’t beforehand.”
Beyond the scope of TV drama, Baer also noted the potential of film documentaries to give a voice to untold stories, describing his most recent project, “Mozambique,” in which he helped to chronicle a 16-year-old’s plight as an AIDS orphan in Africa.
Ted Bogosian, a Kennedy School of Government graduate and local filmmaker that attended the forum, praised Baer’s effectiveness as a communicator.
“Between drama and documentary, there are different methods of storytelling but all are in search of truth,” Bogosian said. “What Baer is excellent at is conveying not only journalistic truth but also emotional truth.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The singing man dressed in a colorful parka who is often on his knees scrubbing graves in Cambridge’s Old Burying Ground often elicits confusion in Quad students walking to and from class. But Dario Fiorentini’s enthusiastic abandon is due to his passion for his work as a conservator.
“This job becomes like a second skin,” he says. “It’s inside you.”
The city hired Fiorentini, a Roman-born conservator, to restore the sixteen table tombs—gravestones that either lie horizontally on the ground or are supported by four legs—in Cambridge’s oldest cemetery. He brings an artistic sensibility and creative spirit to his work, which can sometimes be laborious or mechanical.
Fiorentini has a deep respect for history and artifact, a quality he considers important for his work. Indeed, the somber Old Burying Ground, lodged in the bustling city—between two historic churches and an upscale pizzeria—is saturated with narratives of Cambridge’s past.
A PLOT OF HISTORY
The Old Burying Ground has been used as a graveyard in Cambridge since at least 1635, just four years after the city’s founding, and one year before the founding of Harvard College. Revolutionary War veterans are buried there, including two black soldiers, as well as the early presidents of the College. These early presidents include Harvard’s first president Henry Dunster, as well as Charles Chauncy, Benjamin Wadsworth, class of 1690, Edward Holyoke, class of 1705, Joseph Willard, class of 1765, and Samuel Webber, class of 1784, according to Samuel A. Eliot’s “A History of Cambridge, Massachussetts 1630-1913.”
Even though the land has long been home to such illustrious corpses, Eliot suggests that “it seems not to have been very carefully guarded.” He points to evidence that it was used as a sheep pasture until 1702.
Grazing sheep have been replaced with ambling tourists, strolling in between the graves and searching for a flavor of Cambridge’s history.  Yet, Fiorentini complains that the sacred ground is ill-treated by some of the graveyard’s current visitors. He notes that when he comes to work, he sometimes finds Smirnoff liquor bottles or cans of Bud Light littering the cemetery, or even uprooted gravestones on occasion.
“They use this as a playground,” he says. “They have to pick up their trash.” “They drink,” he adds with a compassionate and understanding tone.  “But they have a very bad habit.”
Unlike in years past, the front gate to the cemetery is now chained and locked to discourage such misuse of the space; but the chain has been broken many times.
“This is not acceptable” Fiorentini says, shaking his head sadly. “This place needs to be taken care of more often.”
“TREATING” THE GRAVES
Fiorentini’s care and concern for his work is apparent in his meticulous, almost clinical “treatment” of the graves.
“You have to respect the place where you work,” he says. “Every time you do some work you need to know the stone, what it needs. You try to do a treatment so that you will save the piece for the next generation, to preserve it.”
Fiorentini has developed a complex restoration process. Before he start cleaning a piece of a gravestone, he injects it with resin to stabilize it. Then after a few days he cleans the piece “section by section, without removing anything.” Next he begins to repair and fill any damage with the appropriate kind of mortar. After that comes the final measure, which Fiorentini calls “consolidation.”  He describes this ultimate step as the one that looks towards the future.
“You think: How are we going to preserve the piece? This is consolidation,” he says. “Consolidation is that you impregnate the stone with a chemical compound that will penetrate deeply into the stone, which causes a catalystic reaction.”
After the compound is applied, Fiorentini washes the piece with a low pressure power washer, waits 15 to 30 minutes and repeats the process about three times. Then he tests the grave to make sure that the stone can “breathe,” which means that it will be able to release the pollutants that may seep into it due to acid rain and smog.
If it passes the test, he stops.  If not, he continues to “consolidate” the piece until the desired affect is achieved.
“You stop when the stone tells you to stop,” he says.
Fiorentini describes consolidation as an essential step in restoration.
“With the consolidation, there is less need for further maintenance and so upkeep will cost less money,” Fiorentini explains.
Despite the regimented process, Fiorentini is careful to emphasize that restoration for each piece is different.
“You have to find the right recipe,” he says. “It’s like a doctor, like a physician, if he’s a good doctor he won’t do the same thing for every patient.”
Indeed, Fiorentini describes himself as having a very personal relationship with his work.
“I don’t mean to say that I am crazy, but when you touch something you and it are bonded,” he says. “When I work it’s like the piece becomes part of myself. It becomes like a friend.”
ART AND CONSERVATION
Tall, skinny, and bespectacled Fiorentini emphasizes that while his approach to restoration is methodical, he also draws on his background as an artist to take into account “the aesthetic value” of the piece.
“I always approach my work in the artistic way,” Fiorentini says. “I always keep my own vision. The object is not just an artifact. It has a value; it has a shape.”
Fiorentini is a classically trained artist, a painter, and comes from an artistic family. His father was also an artist and his brother, Paolo Fiorentino, is an accomplished Italian painter.
Fiorentini took a slightly different path, however, when he started interning at a conservation laboratory for archaeology research in Rome, working  on the Palatine Hill in 1983. From then on he worked on many conservation and restoration projects around Rome.
He did not come to America until 1991, when he crossed the ocean for love. He met his wife in Rome when she was on vacation there in the late 1980s. After having spent a year in Rome, she then had to return to her work in Massachussetts.  Ultimately, Fiorentini decided to move to America so that he could live with her in the States. They now have two children: Alexander, who is 14, and Arianna, who is 10.
Fiorentini believes in truly expressing himself in both his life and his work.
“When I work I sing,” he says. “Maybe it’s strange, maybe it’s Italian.”
He later adds, “The singing is like a release. Your soul releases and you don’t have to worry about anything else. When I sing I’m fully here. Its the best experience for work.”

As survivors wade through waist-deep floodwaters in the aftermath of Typhoon Ketsana, students of the Harvard Philippine Forum (HPF) have begun raising funds and awareness to help its victims.
HPF is collaborating with the Student Calamity Fund, an organization launched by Harvard Business School students in response to the typhoon, which has left 295 dead.
Co-president of HPF Edmund G. Soriano ’11 said he anticipates “putting up a unified front to raise awareness.”
The relief effort includes a clothing drive, a possible raffle fundraiser, and a benefit performance co-sponsored by the Harvard Vietnamese Association (HVA). HVA’s vice-president Huy V. Nguyen ’10 said the show will involve “diverse groups to get a diverse audience to raise as much awareness as possible.” The benefit show will also include pictures and video clips to show the extent of devastation in the Philippines.
David N. Campbell, executive director of the Hands on Disaster Response, an organization that has already sent a team to assess the situation in the Philippines, said he was skeptical about the success of groups working from afar.
However, he said that “it’s great to have students connected to people in need.”
Michael J. VanRooyen, co-director of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, said he was more optimistic that “student efforts play a positive role in generating a bigger buzz of activity.”
Raising awareness has been the main achievable objective of many Harvard student groups spearheading disaster relief efforts in the past.
In response to last year’s earthquake in China’s Sichuan province, the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association collaborated with other Chinese student groups to host a candlelight vigil and a donation collection event, in which the money raised was matched by Johnson & Johnson. Janet He ’10, former co-president of CSA, also emphasized the effectiveness of raising awareness over raising funds on the undergraduate level.
While HPF lacks an official sponsor, the group’s Education and Finance Director and relief effort organizer John P. Gobok ’12 said, “Our niche is creating awareness on campus.”
Andrew R. Marks, director of communications for Paul Farmer’s famed Partners in Health lauded HPF’s efforts in aiding the victims of Typhoon Ketsana by garnering “support to help people get back on their feet.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During World War I, more American women died during childbirth than American men fell in combat. And while western countries have since raised healthcare quality for women to preclude such a statistic, complications during childbirth still pose a significant problem in the developing world, said journalists Nicholas D. Kristof ’81-’82 and Sheryl WuDunn at the Brattle Street Theater last night.
Kristof and WuDunn—the first married couple to win a Pulitzer Prize together—spoke to a packed audience of their experiences in Malaysia and Africa while promoting their new co-authored book “Half the Sky,” which draws from the Chinese saying “women hold up half the sky.”
“The 21st Century cause is the gender inequality around the globe...and that is not a hyperbole,” Kristof said.
They said the goal of their book was to begin a social movement at the grass-roots level, describing the health-related obstacles women face in the developing world, including death and injury during childbirth, sex-trafficking, slavery, denial of education, and malnutrition.
“We want to recruit you to the movement,” Kristof said. “Women and girls aren’t the problem. They are the solution.”
Kristof spoke of the “dirty little secret of development”—that bad spending decisions are disproportionately made by men: 20 percent of daily income in Africa is spent by men on alcohol, tobacco, prostitution, and sugary drinks, and a portion of that spending could be shifted towards educating girls, he said. Educating girls also has a positive economic return over time, he added.
WuDunn then outlined the “agenda” for the movement, which she said needed to begin by ending sex trafficking through providing education and alternate employment options to women. In approaching change, she said, gradual changes are better than none at all.
Several members of the Harvard student-run non-profit, Circle of Women—which promotes the education of women in the developing world and has just finished building a secondary school in Afghanistan—were present at the event. Elizabeth K. Brook ’10, co-director of the organization, said she agreed with Kristof and WuDunn’s emphasis on incremental efforts, explaining that the cost of education and clean water can be covered for a student in their newly-constructed school with just $5 per month.

Students at Harvard and around the world searching for hard-to-find works by such literary luminaries as Arthur Miller, Joyce Carol Oates, and John H. Updike ’54 will not have to look farther than their computer screens anymore.
The Harvard Review, a literary journal published at Harvard under various names since 1986, announced Thursday that all of its back issues except those published within the past three years are now available on JSTOR, a digital archive of scholarly journals.
The Review, which is based in Houghton Library at Harvard, currently prints 2,000 to 2,500 copies of each semiannual issue, which is “fairly small for a literary journal,” according to Editor Christina A. Thompson. These copies are sold to bookstores, university libraries, and subscribers.
“The reality is, we can’t get it to everyone who might want to read it,” Thompson said. “Online access is a game-changer.”
Many prominent fiction and poetry writers enter the publishing world by submitting works to literary journals such as the Harvard Review. Today, scholars studying those authors who wish to read these rare early pieces frequently end up hunting for a copy of a certain issue of the Review.
Thompson said she is “always fielding inquiries” from researchers looking for a piece that a certain author published in the Review before hitting it big on the literary circuit. “Until now, I would either send them old copies or scan them. Now I can just say, go to JSTOR.”
In addition to aiding researchers, the Review should benefit from placement in this prominent online compendium, said Laura Farwell Blake, interim head of research services in Lamont Library. “This puts the Harvard Review in the company of the journals in JSTOR, and that’s a good place to be. It brings a local resource very much into the global world.”
Thompson called JSTOR, which according to its Web site is utilized by over 5,700 institutions worldwide, “the gold standard” of online research tools, and Farwell Blake agreed that it is “one of the most widely used resources there is.”
Thompson said that the Review was concerned about the financial implications of the decision to join JSTOR, noting that the funds that the Review receives from sublicensing its content to JSTOR are less than traditional revenue from print susbscriptions.
Nevertheless, she said she was “keen” to bring the Review to JSTOR.
“We’re not in this to make money; we’re in this to promote literature,” she said. “The best way to promote it is to make sure people can read it, and the best way to make sure people can read it is to make it available online.”

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, which grew out of Radcliffe College, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this month with an emphasis on crossing boundaries, a facet of the Institute members say facilitates its research.
Housed on the grounds of Harvard’s former female counterpoint, the Institute now serves as a site for academicians—both students and professors, men and women—to pursue a more advanced field of study, ranging from the biological sciences to the humanities.
“The anniversary was a natural moment to pause and reflect on the ground-breaking research and creative thinking that the Radcliffe Institute has fostered over the last decade,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an e-mailed statement.
One Radcliffe Fellow, Joanna Aizenberg, who is a professor of materials science at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, said that the Institute provides an opportunity to “establish connections between the arts and sciences, so science may not be seen as so boring.”
Calling the Institute “instrumental” in bridging academic divisions, Aizenberg said she spends her time at the Institute observing how biological materials can be used as templates for building better structures.
Spanning several academic disciplines, Aizenberg researches the glass skeletons of deep underwater sea sponges inhabited by shrimp, which serve as an inspiration for constructing buildings.
For James L. Mallet, a professor of biological diversity at University College London and a Helen Putnam Fellow at Radcliffe, working at the Institute is an “escape from bureaucracy” which provides a wealth of library research.
Mallet has taken time away from lab research on butterflies to write a book to clarify a Darwinian understanding of species, in which he argues that species don’t exist genetically, evolutionarily, or ecologically. “We are rather a collection of individuals than a species,” he said.
While the recent economic downturn has poked a hole in its budget, the Institute’s dean, Barbara J. Grosz, said that Radcliffe is working closely to maintain its programs and academic resources.
“Budget cuts have affected our programs, but we have made a five year budget plan to keep the strength of the fellowship program, the Schlesinger Library, and the academic engagement programs,” she said.
The Institute’s celebration of crossing boundaries will entail a symposium to be held later this week.
CORRECTIONS
An earlier version of the Oct. 6 news article "Radcliffe Celebrates 10th Anniversary" incorrectly quoted Radcliffe Dean Barbara J. Grosz as saying budget cuts had not affected the Institute's programs. In fact, she said that budget cuts had affected its programs.
The article also incorrectly stated that the Radcliffe Institute's celebration of "crossing boundaries" would entail a series of events this week. In fact, only one symposium had been planned.

Harvard has made a commitment to the City of Boston allowing residential development on a small parcel of its landholdings in Allston—a rare gesture from a University that has frustrated residents by remaining closemouthed about its plans for certain neighborhood properties.
The commitment, announced last night by Boston Redevelopment Authority Director John F. Palmieri, has yet to be put in writing, but pertains to a 0.7 acre site currently occupied by the Brookline Machine Company that Harvard quietly purchased late last year. Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino is now pressing the University to immediately begin exploring the feasibility of initiating residential development on the site, according to Palmieri.
The announcement came at the second of two public review sessions held by the BRA aimed at collecting community input about a plan to relocate the Charlesview Apartments that is slated for City authorization in the coming months or even weeks. In a bid to consolidate its land holdings in Allston, Harvard has signed an agreement with the Charlesview board that would give the University control of the current apartment buildings, which are situated near the Business School, in exchange for development of a new housing complex a half-mile away.
The relocation of the apartments, which is tentatively slated for completion in 2012, represents the first step in a broader community-wide redevelopment of Allston, which many residents say is only possible if the University commits more land to the cause.
City officials framed yesterday’s announcement as an “integral” step in that direction and a chance to ensure a healthy North Allston community around Charlesview, but local residents remained indignant, insisting that the offering of the Machine Company plot is inadequate and characteristically vague.
“Harvard’s attitude is offensively superficial if it thinks a 0.7 acre parcel is enough to make us shut up and go away,” said Brent Whelan ’73, another resident and member of the Task Force.
Conversation remained heated, divisive, and often tense throughout the meeting as BRA planners outlined the Charlesview plan and neighborhood residents provided comments and criticisms.
Some community members reiterated long-standing concerns about the height and density of the proposed new apartments, as well as what they perceive to be an insufficient amount of commercial and open space in the City’s plan to redevelop Allston. Others called on top University officials to address residents personally at future meetings.
But in the end, the meeting’s implications were elusive. Harry Mattison, a long-term community activist and Task Force member, said that he thought the public comment meeting was “unproductive” and “just for show.” He said he believed that the BRA has already made a decision to approve the plan.
A small contingent of Charlesview residents and board members attended the meeting as well, imploring city officials to approve the plans. One Charlesview resident, Raisa Shapiro, angrily denounced the repeated delays and said that the current buildings are in “unlivable” condition. At one point, she presented a plastic bag containing two dead rats that she said she had found in her apartment—drawing gasps and glares from Allston residents.
But many community members seemed unswayed, criticizing Shapiro for exploiting what they said should be a matter of “personal responsibility” and home maintenance.

The government of the island nation of Cyprus has pledged $8.8 million towards increasing opportunities in public health education, research, and outreach as part of a recent agreement between the Harvard School of Public Health and the Cyprus University of Technology.
Under the five-year agreement, signed on October 2, the CUT will absorb the Cyprus International Institute for the Environment and Public Health, which was founded in an earlier agreement between Harvard and Cyprus when the partnership between the two began in 2004.
Four new masters programs—public health, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health systems—will eventually be offered as part of the revamped CUT curriculum. Plans for initiating doctoral programs are also underway.
Discussions aimed at strengthening the existing collaboration between HSPH and the Cypriot government began soon after the nation’s new president, Dimitris Christofias, took office in February of last year, according to Monique Bertic, the associate director for international advancement at HSPH who coordinates the partnership.
“This is a new phase in the development of our relationship with Cyprus, where we both have a shared commitment to strengthen public health in the region,” Bertic said.
Bertic and Douglas W. Dockery, the chair of the environmental health department at HSPH, emphasized the regional focus of the project—which is intended to target more than just Cyprus.
“The vision is the same [as before]— to use Cyprus, which is in such a geographically important part of the world, as leverage to... train a whole generation of scientists in environmental and public health,” said Dockery.
Under the new agreement, approximately 35 Harvard faculty members who are involved in the Cypriot partnership program will be able to teach courses in Cyprus, according to Bertic.
“This is a unique opportunity for students everywhere,” said Andreas Panayiotou, the consul-general of the Republic of Cyprus. “Cyprus can take advantage of the expertise Harvard offers, and there will be much intellectual exchange.”
Ultimately, Bertic said, the goal of the collaboration with Cyprus is to develop the existing degree programs into a school of public health on the island, which does not yet have such an institution.
“I’m hoping this’ll keep being renewed every five years,” said Behrooz Behbod, a third year doctoral candidate at HSPH who was in the first class of students in Cyprus to benefit from the Harvard partnership.
“There’s definitely a need for greater diversity of public health degrees in Cyprus,” Behbod said.

CORRECTION APPENDED
“Passionate” was the word friends, teammates, coaches, and Harvard officials used to describe Ariel E.F. Shaker ’10—who was involved in a fatal horse-riding accident last Thursday.
College administrators e-mailed undergraduates Monday to notify the community that the accident had been fatal. Shaker is currently brain-dead at Boston Medical Center, and is expected to pass away in the coming days.
A Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator with a secondary field in English from Palo Alto, Calif., Shaker recently joined the Polo Club, though she had long been a fan of riding horses. Shaker also served as the Resource Efficiency Program representative for Cabot House and was previously a member of the women’s Heavyweight Crew team.
"Ariel was truly a person committed to improving our world; whether from an environmental, aesthetic, or political perspective, she worked to bring sustained beauty into our lives," Harris wrote. "Her infectious smile and wry wit enlivened any conversation, and this, added to her fierce loyalty to her friends, teammates, and the broader Cabot community, made her a true delight to be with. We will miss her in incalculable ways."
Shaker was injured while she and another student were practicing at Pony Express in Ipswich, Mass., according to The Salem News. Police told the newspaper that Shaker was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident.
Shaker was taken by helicopter to Boston Medical Center with extensive internal bleeding in her head, according to an e-mail sent to Harvard Polo Club members by coach Crocker Snow Jr. ’61 early Friday morning.
The Harrises have invited students to gather in their home this evening beginning at 7:30 p.m. "to share our grief, and to celebrate Ariel's remarkable life," according to Harris's e-mail.

CORRECTION
The original version of the Oct. 7 news article "Senior Ariel Shaker Passes Away" incorrectly stated in the headline and text of the article that Ariel E.F. Shaker '10 had passed away on Oct. 6, based on e-mails sent by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris, who both wrote that Shaker had died. In fact, College spokesman Jeff Neal later clarified that those e-mails were inaccurate, and that though Shaker was brain-dead and will not make a meaningful recovery, she is still being kept physically alive in order to allow her to be an organ donor. Below is a portion of a statement sent by Neal late Wednesday night:
"Ariel's family decided on Monday to end artificial life support for their daughter and to donate her organs for transplant. While the medical process can take several days, Ariel will not make a meaningful recovery and a family has lost their daughter. After discussing the situation with the medical team, Ariel's mother authorized the college to communicate her passing to the community.
We continue to keep Ariel's family and her friends in our thoughts during this extraordinarily difficult time."

“It kind of all blurs together,” said junior cross-country runner Dan Chenoweth with a laugh. “I remember being in pain, that’s all.”
If you are surprised to learn that Chenoweth actually feels pain, join the club. But rest assured—he certainly doesn’t let it slow him down. A star Harvard runner, he blew away the competition last Friday in a dual meet against Yale, placing first by a decisive margin of 24 seconds. Chenoweth finished the 8-kilometer circuit in 24:20, his personal best for the Franklin Park course.
His outstanding performance could not have come at a better time, for two reasons. First, the Crimson was facing the Bulldogs in the biggest race of the season so far. Second, Harvard was racing without captain Chas Gillespie, who has not competed this year due to injury.
“We’ve really missed him this year,” Chenoweth said. “Chas and I will train together and race together. It’s a mental help.”
Chenoweth noted the lack of in-race companionship and competition that Chas usually provides.
“That makes everything easier, pushing each other,” he added. “I’m looking forward to having him back.”
Until Gillespie returns, Chenoweth will have to continue dominating alone. He pulled in front of the pack early on Friday, and only drew further ahead as the race continued.
“The plan was to go a hard first mile,” the junior said. “I got that accomplished. Then I thought, ‘OK, I need to settle into a rhythm, feel relaxed—it’s a long race.”
Gillespie praised Chenoweth, adding that his performance was nothing new.
“I think the whole team has come to expect great things from Dan,” Gillespie said. “He basically dominated right from the start. It was wonderful.”
Chenoweth, aside from his personal ability, has benefited the team by taking a leadership role.
“He’s such a great example of working hard in order to get better every time,” Gillespie said. “Very tenacious like that. He’s a positive influence on everybody.”
Crimson head coach Jason Saretsky echoed Gillespie’s praise.
“[Dan] sets a great example with his work ethic and competitiveness,” Saretsky said. “He’s been making sure we’re pushing the guys, focusing on what’s at hand. He’s growing into being a leader on the team.”
The coach added that Chenoweth has become “a great complement to Chas.”
Gillespie and Chenoweth have become very close, close enough that the captain is comfortable pointing out some areas where his teammate’s game could improve.
“He is thinking about growing a mustache,” Gillespie said. “If he had had the mustache on [Friday], he could have gone 24:15.”
Chenoweth and Gillespie finished 1-2 in the Harvard-Yale meet last year, making this the second straight year that Chenoweth has won. The experience only makes him more dangerous.
“He has a confidence in his fitness,” Saretsky said. “He focuses on what he can control and lets the rest take care of itself.”
Chenoweth, along with the Harvard team, proved definitively that they are in good shape for the season.
“It was a good first race,” Chenoweth said. “One of the goals is to get out there and see what kind of shape we’re in.”
“I was able to prove to myself that I’m getting into race shape,” he added. “It was nice to be able to get out there and run a good time and feel good doing it.”
But proving themselves aside, all agreed that it was extra sweet to beat the Bulldogs. With this victory, the Crimson has triumphed three years in a row—every year, Chenoweth noted, that he has been at Harvard.
“We have a couple meets to look forward to every year,” Chenoweth said. “We want to continue the streak as long as we can.”
“We looked forward to [this meet] all summer and all fall,” Gillespie added. “It’s got such an enormous history.” This year’s meet was the 97th between the two schools.
Chenoweth did all he could to have it swing the Crimson’s way. But while the race for first place was a blowout, the meet as a whole was tight until the end, when Harvard came through, 26-29. Chenoweth pointed to a team-wide strategy to start off fast.
“It usually goes out pretty slow,” Chenoweth said. “The Yale guys weren’t ready for us to [start off] like that.”
And for Chenoweth, the strategy was perfect.
“I just took off,” Chenoweth said simply. “The Yale guys kind of let me go.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a weekend full of wild weather, it wasn’t rain that stopped the Harvard sailing team—it was the sun.
Still skies on Sunday cut the co-eds’ weekend at the Smith Trophy short, and in limited racing, the Crimson finished in the middle of the pack in 13th place.
Elsewhere in Boston, the Harvard women turned in their best finish of the season, placing second overall at the Women’s Regis Bowl.
The co-eds sent a second group to Central Series Four, where the Crimson took ninth place, but Sunday’s Harvard Invite was cancelled due to lack of wind.
“We’ve only had three races so far, and I think we’ve made a few avoidable mistakes that we’re working on correcting right now,” sophomore skipper Emily Lambert said. “The season’s been really good so far, but I think we can really see improvement.”
WOMEN’S REGIS BOWL
Harvard’s all-female quartet traveled down the Charles to compete in the Boston University-hosted Women’s Regis Bowl, and came away in a tie for second place among the 10 competing schools.
“This weekend was somewhat less competitive of a regatta than the bigger ones we’re used to,” Lambert said. “But it was a really good time to practice for upcoming events.”
Lambert skippered the Crimson’s top boat, while classmate Alexandra Jumper handled the crewing duties.
The pair placed fourth overall in the combined division of 20 boats, finishing in the top three in half of the weekend’s 12 races and winning once.
And while Harvard’s second boat took first-place honors in two races, skipper and captain Liz Powers and sophomore crew Marie Appel couldn’t match the consistency of their A-boat counterparts, finishing eighth overall.
Powers and Appel recorded four top-10 finishes in addition to their two wins.
Though the conditions were unpleasant, the seasoned Crimson women felt comfortable in their home waters.
“We were sailing on the Charles, so it was conditions we’re used to seeing in practice, which probably gave us somewhat of a local advantage,” Lambert said. “The rain just meant that we had to wear more clothing and be wet—it didn’t really affect sailing too much.”
As a team, Harvard finished with 160 points, matching Tufts’ total for second place. Boston College won the regatta with 126 points.
SMITH TROPHY
In college sailing’s largest regatta, the Crimson co-eds were able to keep pace, finishing 13th in a field of 26 schools representing most of New England college sailing.
Harvard sailed the regatta, hosted by MIT, without its top tandems, instead giving some of its less-experienced sailors a chance to test the waters.
“It was definitely an opportunity to gain some experience,” junior skipper Colin Santangelo said. “It’s a pretty high-level regatta, and it’s pretty important that we did well. There was a little more pressure on us than usual.”
Santangelo and freshman crew Sarah McCuskee tied for ninth in the A division, matching Roger Williams with 74 points. The pair started the weekend strong, finishing sixth and second in the first two races, but faded later in the shifty conditions.
“Saturday was really rainy, and the rain has a tendency to kill off the breeze a little bit—it was lighter than it would have been otherwise,” Santangelo said. “It was shifty because it was coming off all the buildings in Boston, and it was hard to predict the wind shifts.”
Sailing in the B division for Harvard was the tandem of freshman skipper Ryan Byrne and senior crew Michelle Konstadt. The pair was 14th among B boats with 111 points.
Byrne and Konstadt cracked the top 10 twice, recording a fourth and fifth-place finish over Saturday’s nine races.
Rhode Island handily won the regatta, besting runner-up Connecticut by 20 points.
CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Harvard also sent a co-ed contingent to the local-level Central Series Four regatta, hosted by Tufts. The Crimson placed ninth out of 11 teams, amassing 257 points.
Roger Williams’ top quartet won the event with 73 points.
Senior Alex Bick skippered the A boat, which placed 17th out of 22 competing boats. Sophomore Julia van der Vink served as his crew for the first seven races, with freshman Jin Zang stepping in for the final race.
Harvard’s B boat was right behind in 18th place. Freshman Sam Millham was the skipper, while sophomore William White took on crew duties. The B pair’s ninth-place finish in the regatta’s final race was the only time a Crimson boat placed in the top 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As I was sitting in the Office of Career Services (OCS) last week, cramming case study formations from my crumpled piece of wide-ruled notebook paper into my head so that I might one day get a bid for my soul, I couldn’t help but wonder: is the dude across from me wearing a tight suit so he can look like an athlete, or does being an athlete just make the suit look like an impulse order off of Gilt Groupe?
My nervous scrutiny of my peers stopped at this point, and I started wondering just how different my recruiting experiences were from the size-18 neck guy I was waiting with.
Do varsity athletes suffer with job searches because they spend 20-plus hours over the river and traveling to schools nationwide?
Or does the fact that they must exhibit great discipline and time management skills in order to complete both their physical and academic obligations make them more attractive to recruiters, giving them an edge?
Surely, being an athlete both helps and hurts in this regard. What they all share, though, is a heightened appreciation for their specialties during challenging and busy times, most notably when they must relay the values that sports have taught them to others. When times are hard, morale is high.
“Being an athlete is definitely an advantage in some ways,” said Chelsea L. Ono Horn ’10, a right side hitter on Crimson women’s volleyball. “It’s a good bridge for the questions on teamwork and leadership. On the other hand, I’m barely doing school.”
Last summer, Ono Horn interned at LearnVest, a personal finance and education startup. This month, she has been interviewing rigorously with financial institutions and consulting firms.
“In between balancing practice and being away every other weekend, and studying for interviews, I have very little time to write my thesis, take the LSATs in December, and keep up with all of the reading for my courses,” Ono Horn added.
All of that said, her recent experiences have brought about the moments when she is perhaps the most grateful for her volleyball career.
“I can’t imagine not being an athlete at Harvard, its so much my identity. I wouldn’t sacrifice that just so that I could have more time for recruiting. Something’s gotta give.”
Crimson women’s tennis player Agnes K. Sibilski ’11 takes a different approach, as she seeks to integrate athletics and occupations.
This past summer she traveled to Bonn, Germany to work for the International Paralympic Committee in their Scientific and Medical Department.
A premed student, Sibilski sees sports and medicine in her future. While reflecting on her time here, she realizes that tennis is her complement to the pressures of Harvard.
“I try to distance myself, so I’m not always thinking about tennis and I get a break from it,” Sibilski said. “That way, it’s more of an outlet.”
Former Crimson men’s basketball player Ndu Okereke ’10 has followed a more traditional Harvard path, which started when he landed a summer internship with Goldman Sachs in his sophomore year, when he was still playing varsity baskeball. On the team, Okereke benefitted from the competitive and collaborative atmosphere.
“I wouldn’t say [athletes] have an edge, but I would say that the team experience helps prepare them, as it helps them become better at dealing with people. And these are people businesses.”
While I won’t be able to tell you what became of our friend in the OCS lounge, I will say from my conversations with athletes that he probably never experienced a more transitional period in his life that has caused him to articulate so naturally why he gets up at the crack of dawn every day. When you grow up immersed in an activity that shapes your character and your behavior, there is nothing more rewarding than taking lessons learned over the years and applying them to a successful career, no matter what field it may be in. That makes it all worth it.

Harvard College Library is going online!
Find out more about this electronic enterprise after the jump.
According to an article posted in the news section of the Harvard College Library website, HCL placed an ad on Facebook to publicize last month's Freshman Open House at Lamont. The ad portrayed a crimson shield with an "H" on it next to the text "LOL @ FOH."
The posting proudly proclaims that of the 160,000 times the ad was viewed, it was clicked on by 163 people. In case we don't feel up to doing the math, HCL lets us know that this transfers to a click through rate of 0.10 percent. The library views the ad as a success, citing 0.04 percent as the click-through rate "that is typically considered successful in direct mail and online" and calling it "'a highly efficient and  cost-effective way of communicating with our students,'” in the words of Michael Hemment, Head of Research  and Learning Technology for HCL.
FlyBy looks forward to seeing what HCL puts in future Facebook ads. A coupon for free Lamont coffee after midnight, maybe? Now that's something that would be worth clicking.

Early this morning, Dr. Jack Szostak of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School learned that he and two colleagues had won the Nobel Prize in medicine for their work with telomerase, an enzyme that prevents chromosomes from, um, "fraying." Yeah. We'll leave our explanation at that.
Szostak's two colleagues were Elizabeth Blackburn of UC San Francisco and Carol W. Greider of Johns Hopkins. Apparently, the three had begun working together on the topic back in the 1980s, when none of us were even alive, much less pretentious enough to pretend that we actually know what telomerase is or what it does.
FlyBy is grateful that gifted minds such as Szostak's and his colleagues' still exist out there, although it would sure be nice if some of that brain power could diffuse (check out that science action!) for those of us who can't even finish our LifeSci 1a problem sets...

A cross-disciplinary gaggle of Nobel Laureates and Ig Nobel Laureates gathered in Sanders on Thursday for the 2009 Ig Nobels, honors bestowed on "achievements that first              make people LAUGH, and then make them THINK [sic]." While Thursday's ceremony was indeed goofy and thought-provoking, the  traditional 60-second acceptance speeches left little room for explanations. If you were left wondering why anyone would invent a brassiere/gas mask or experiment with panda feces, then you were in luck. The (free!) The Ig Informal Lectures were Saturday at 1:00 PM in MIT Building 10, Room 250, 77 Mass. Ave. Winners and "several" laureates explained their award-winning research and took questions.
In the meantime, we've got some Ig ridiculousness to get you through the week: Lab coat-wearing accordionists playing Rossini in Memorial Hall before the event!

That's right: Harvard College students overwhelmingly voted for Where the Wild Things Are as their number-one choice for the College Events Board's Dinner and a Movie Night on Thurs., Oct. 22.
CEB chair Kevin M. Mee '10 could easily explain why 45.2 percent of students voted for this children's book-turned-movie, while the runner-up (Couples Retreat) garnered only 25.2 percent of the vote:
"It’s to get in touch with their inner child, and this is one of the stories that so many of us did read when we were kids," said Mee, an Economics concentrator in Kirkland House. "Everyone recognized it."
Even though the College has reduced CEB's budget for the year, CEB's third annual Dinner and a Movie Night may prove to be a "wild rumpus." According to Mee, CEB has rented out all 500 or so seats in the Harvard Square Theater at a discounted rate (on a Thursday, since Fridays and Saturdays are much busier), and the event has been sold out for both years so far. Mee said that CEB will release info next week about when to pick up free tickets from the Harvard Box Office.
They are also hoping for about 20 Harvard Square restaurants to offer discounts for students who show their Harvard IDs at any time of day on Oct. 22. In the past, these discounts have been on the order of around 15 percent off, with high-end and plebeian restaurants alike offering discounts to Harvard students.

Have you been wondering if you may be depressed? Feeling constantly tired and overwhelmed are standard for the average Harvard experience, but they could also indicate something more serious. Today, UHS and the Center for Wellness are hosting a depression screening from 5:30-7 p.m. in Adams House to help sort out these different cases--with incentive to participate, of course. After a 10-ish minute screening, you will be rewarded with a $5 J.P. Licks gift card. Yum.

It looks like the College Events Board won’t be taking Mather House to its upcoming Dinner and a Movie Night on Thurs., October 22.
But the CEB decided to encourage the College community to see the same movie six days later. For free. (Mather was planning to charge all along.)
Mather HoCo approached the CEB to reconsider the movie choice. But after a campus-wide poll, students overwhelmingly voted for The Wild Things. The movie. Not the Matherites. More on the mutiny after the jump.
Mather wasn’t going to let the CEB have the last word, though. In response, Mather threatened to withhold House funding for the CEB’s Harvard-Yale pep rally. In years past, the CEB has sought the consent of the 12 upperclassmen Houses to use funds allotted for one night’s brain break for the pep rally. The other 11 Houses, by the way, gave the CEB the go-ahead.
The belligerent back-and-forth that has taken place over the last few days has been for naught.
The College Fun Czar has tamed the Mather beast—she told the CEB that it was ultimately up to the Dean and Harvard University Dining Services to reappropriate those brain break funds for the Harvard-Yale pep rally.
Maybe not the appropriate title, according to one avid (maybe rabid?) Matherite.

When Tom Cruise starred in the film adaptation of the legal thriller The Firm, the book's author John Grisham later tipped his hat to Cruise, who played a recent Harvard Law School grad: "I thought [Cruise] did a good job," Grisham said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. "He played the innocent young associate very well."
Very well, indeed. And let's not forget the time when Cruise played an HLS alum/JAG corps member in A Few Good Men. But it seems as though the actor's ability to blend into the role of an attorney has disintegrated over the years, considering how much attention he drew yesterday when he snuck into an entertainment law class over at the Law School. Lawyer Bertram Fields '52, who has represented countless celebrities, paid a visit to the class to discuss his Hollywood travails—but in just 30 minutes, Fields was overshadowed by the arrival of his client.
According to The Harvard Law Record, Cruise "surreptitiously" entered the classroom and "flashed his megawatt smile" at titillated students, announcing that "he was there to see Bert speak; after all, he'd never had a chance to hear him lecture before." What a considerate client! More after the jump.
Cruise snuggled into the back row of the classroom and "assumed an attentive posture." Students, the creepily omniscient HLR reports, threw Cruise a few smiles but immediately resumed their "normal classroom activities": note-taking, hand-raising, "GChat"-ing, and—very weird, Harvard Law Review Record—browsing Net-a-Porter and Bergdorf Goodman. And then, "From time to time they would steal a sidelong look at the glowing actor." (Okay, so who thinks the author of this article was actually in the classroom when this all happened and was simultaneously shopping for a new Donna Karan shift? We do.)
Anyway, Cruise didn't make too much of an effort to disappear into the general crowd, and he parried questions from Fields, spoke about his experiences with tabloids, and made sure that even in the classroom, all the facts were straight.
Cruise—who prolifically offered "advice, stories, high fives, handshakes, hugs, and even at one point an impromptu dance"—stayed after class to speak with students, including a hoard of people that had gathered by the room as soon as virtual messaging systems went haywire within the classroom when Cruise first appeared.
The man might not make a good lawyer, but he sure does know how to win a crowd. And that's called fine acting, my friends.
