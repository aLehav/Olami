After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting in on a rehearsal with new Harvard Dance Program lecturer Mario A. Zambrano, the only thing more striking than his expertise is the easy rapport he has with his students. Zambrano is a former member of Batsheva Dance Company and a published novelist. He’s also danced with Ballet Frankfurt, Nederlands Dans Theater, and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. An award-winning artist, Zambrano teaches two new for-credit courses this semester, “Deconstructing a Novel into Dance,” and “GAGA: Movement Language Created by Ohad Naharin.” The Crimson sat down with him to learn about his career and new role at Harvard.

The Harvard Crimson: When did you begin your dance career and when did you decide that you wanted to dance professionally?
Mario A. Zambrano: I’m Mexican, and I grew up in Houston, and part of my Mexican upbringing [was] attending a lot of Mexican weddings and quinceañeras … [My mom] would just always pull me out to dance with her. In those moments all I remember is having such a good time and seeing everyone around me on the dance floor sort of stand back and cheer me on. If you feel that kind of love, that immediacy of love and attention and support and encouragement, you just want to experience it again. I started taking dance when I was ten.
THC: How did you begin your professional training as a dancer?
MAZ: I went to the Houston Ballet Academy, and I got very serious, and then I found the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. I was very busy, but I loved it. By chance there was a contemporary dance company from Chicago that was performing in Houston. They were called Hubbard Street Dance Chicago. I took a class with the company and then I auditioned.  Afterward, I was 16, the director took me aside … and he was like, ‘I’d hire you right now but you’re in school!’ I was very excited about that, and torn, because I wanted to stay for the Houston Ballet, but also in that year I got a full scholarship to Juilliard. In the end, at 17, I began my dance career.
THC: How did you get into writing?
MAZ: I ended up going back to school. [I was] looking for something I could love equally as much as I did dancing. I started seeing [books] as … full-length, choreographic works, but with language, and that really pulled my attention. And then when I started taking it seriously, I went to the New School, and then I applied for MFA programs. I realized how difficult it was to become a writer, so when I got into Iowa, and then I got an agent, and I got a publisher, it was a big surprise. Big, big surprise.
THC: How did you end up here at Harvard?
MAZ: After I graduated and published [“Lotería"], I was very lucky to have been given the opportunity to be a full-time writer, which was the dream during those eight years of going to school.  People [from the dance world] were always asking me to teach or to come choreograph and while I was studying I told them ‘No, I’m not interested, I’m a writer now,’ but now … I started saying ‘Yes, I will come teach, I will come choreograph.’ And I began to love it again in a different way.
THC: How did your novel affect the course that you’re teaching now, “Deconstructing a Novel into a Dance”?
MAZ: During my graduate studies, a lot of what we did was talk about structure and how novels are composed and put together, and because I’ve always had this affinity to see them as choreographic works, I thought it would be really interesting to bridge these two disciplines [for] students who would be interested in choreography and also literature. We study [three] novels, how they’re put together, their point of view, the thematic … patterns that come up. We talk about architectural interpretation as well—what the book would look like as a building or as a venue. We talk about music. We talk about light. And then we go into the studio and start working with modalities to create movement that will complement … how they want to interpret the novel in the final project, which is a choreographic score of a particular book. So far it’s going well.

“Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions” by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a letter, a style of writing that doesn’t usually inspire much interest. After all, what could be said of import about feminism in the length of the average correspondence? However, Adichie masterfully uses her letter to a friend as an opportunity to write a modern accessible reflection on feminism. Encouraging and uplifting, “Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions” is a book that succeeds in advancing the importance of achieving the equality of women through the use of engaging stories and a relaxed style.
Adichie’s book is set up simply enough, with fifteen suggestions to her friend, Ijeawele, on how to raise her newborn daughter, Chizalum Adaora, as a feminist. Ranging from suggestions to ensure that the mother herself is a fulfilled person to giving her daughter a strong sense of her identity, Adichie covers an entire expanse of child-rearing ideas that are addressed specifically to her friend. For example, Adichie says “be deliberate about showing her the enduring beauty and resilience of Africans and black people.” While she does not limit herself to only discuss raising children, she interweaves stories about other women as a way to give specificity to her claims. “I know this remarkable Nigerian woman, Angela, a single mother who was raising her child in the United States; her child did not take to reading so she decided to pay her five cents per page. An expensive endeavor, she later joked, but a worthy investment,” she says. While this may seem disconnected, it is her way of showing her friend that she must teach her child to read, and perfectly reflects the fact that she makes sure her suggestions are easy for her friend to connect to in some way.
The genius of Adichie’s book is perhaps the fact that anyone can connect to it. While it is written for someone very specific, she uses the resulting familiar tone of her writing to her advantage, as it enables a sense of kinship and understanding between reader and writer. “Your note made me cry. You know how I get foolishly emotional sometimes,” she says. This simple line at the beginning of a book on a serious subject is one key way in which she connects to her audience.
More importantly, once she has made that connection, she is able to use her suggestions even more effectively, as her suggestions are not just for raising a child, but an analysis of the way in which women today live. “Beware the danger of what I call Feminism Lite,” she says. Adichie uses this warning to move her friend away from the philosophy of female equality under some but not all conditions, and yet it raises the question of how prominent “Feminism Lite” is in the modern world. However, Adichie’s book is by no means reprimanding people’s foibles. She criticizes evident injustices, but because her supposed audience is a friend, she keeps her tone light-hearted and friendly at all times.
Perhaps the most inspiring aspect of “Dear Ijeawele” is that in Adichie’s in her capacity as a caring friend, she encourages the celebration of all kinds of beauty and identities. “Teach her to take pride in the history of Africans, and in the black diaspora,” she says. These perspectives may seem somewhat distinct from feminism, but as Adichie shows so masterfully, they in fact build it up. After all, how can a woman fight for her own equality when she feels shame about other aspects of her identity? One key way she does this is by rejecting the trope that feminists reject their femininity. “Feminism and femininity are not mutually exclusive. It is misogynistic to suggest that they are,” she says. And in celebrating the various ways in which women define themselves, she in no ways forgets men. “Surround Chizalum, too, with a village of uncles,” Adichie says. In her vision of a world where women are equal, all good men and women are celebrated, and she seeks to secure this future for young Chizalum.
“Dear Ijeawele” is direct and strongly directed towards an important goal, but Adichie beautifully navigates her way towards finding a code for feminism that anyone can understand and relate to. While proponents of feminism may face many detractors, Adichie’s heartfelt letter to a friend reminds us that while the struggle for the equality of women may ruffle a few feathers, it is done with the hope that young girls will one day live in a world where they will see their own worth, intelligence, and beauty. “Dear Ijeawele” is just the beginning.

SKETCH, an SNL-inspired comedy show put on by the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club, included eleven short sketches filled with witty wordplay and eccentric plots. From a man who is too excited to receive a pat down at airport security to a lesbian who wins “The Bachelor” but is in love with another contestant, a cast of nine students performed a series of ten skits from March 23 to 25. While a few sketches fell a little flat, most were funny and unique.
The performance took place in the Loeb Ex, an intimate black box theater. Although the setup was simple, it worked well for this production. With only a few rows of seating, the audience was close enough to the actors to make microphones unnecessary. The audience’s proximity also made it easy to catch the nuances of the cast’s facial expressions and body language, which are critical to this personal type or humor.
Props were simple and used sparingly, with only a handful in each sketch. However, they did vary from sketch to sketch, allowing the audience to understand the setting of each despite the stage’s consistent black backdrop. The costumes worked in much the same way. The black shirt-and-jean combination rarely changed from scene to scene, but the occasional flannel, jacket, or purse helped orient the audience to the new characters the actors were now portraying. The simple props and costumes focused all attention on the acting itself.
For the most part, the sketches were funny, and the premises were unique. One of the most enjoyable sketches was “Sexual Paralysis,” written by Emma Y. He ’19, which featured a forty-five year old (Sabrina Wu ’20) who has been unable to speak or move for thirty years. Her parents (Eli B Schleicher ’18 and Emma K. Woo ’17) take her to a doctor (Julius Wade ’20) where she uses a machine to speak for the first time in thirty years, and to their disappointment, all of her focus is on the hot male nurse (Michael Perusse ’20). As the doctor tries to explain that his machine is indeed working properly, the girl’s parents become more and more flustered. This skit was only one of many successes in SKETCH. Other hits included “The Bachelor,” written by Wu and John T. Ball ‘20, and “Pat Down,” also written by Ball. All in all, the sketches were varied and unique.
The acting style of the cast fit well with the tone of the show. Although they usually stayed in character, it was also enjoyable to see them genuinely enjoy the jokes they and their fellow cast mates delivered. This occasional breaking of character is similar to that seen on Saturday Night Live, an inspiration for SKETCH, which has made audiences laugh for decades.
Unfortunately, the biggest letdown of the show was the finale, “Pie Sketch,” written by Perusse. For such a strong line-up, it was disappointing to end on something that didn’t reflect the hilarity of the rest of the show. As a pie baking competition took place, the whole cast appeared on stage, one by one, with different interpretations of the word “pie.” The skit included the entire cast, as a new actor emerged every thirty seconds to add to the chaos. Although the appearance of every cast member made this the perfect finale sketch in theory, it lasted too long and there were too many variations of the same joke. With two cast members still to appear, the sketch had already seemed to run its course. While “Pie Sketch” had its moments, it left the audience wanting more from the closing performance.

Once the song “Shooting Stars” by the Australian Bag Raiders was just a song.
Now “Shooting Stars” is a viral internet meme.
The song was released in 2009, and it wasn’t all that popular until 2013. In 2017, it is a legendary and unforgettable background to the millennial art form known as memes.
The meme usually starts out innocent enough, featuring Lady Gaga singing the Star-Spangled Banner, a man diving, Donald Trump spewing his nonsense, or SpongeBob dancing. Then these characters usually end up falling or are edited to repeat an awkward movement which makes it seem like this is a modern version of America’s Funniest Home Videos. Then “Shooting Stars” plays in the background, the sonic accompaniment to psychedelic and hallucinatory backdrops of the Milky Way Galaxy and planets, or something more down-to-Earth such as the breezy ocean-side waves, volcanic explosions, the human body, families of dolphins, or swarms of birds.
My first exposure to this meme was this one, starring a frog. In the video, the presumed owner of the frog keeps poking it with a stick. The frog, out of spite, swats its arm at the presumed owner. This swatting movement is then repeated indefinitely as the background changes and the song goes on. The whole amusing part of the meme is that the characters in the videos are usually taken out of context (like this frog whose owner keeps poking it) and then they are photoshopped into unlikely situations (like this frog coming out of the bomb explosion).
The beauty of this meme is that it is so diverse. Anyone can be featured in it. It does not matter whether you are human, animal, tall, small, gorgeous, hideous, skinny, fat, gay, straight, black, white, cookie-lover, or chicken nugget-hater. Everyone and anyone can be targeted by this viral sensation. But like all things viral, this meme will soon disinterest an audience with the attention span of a toddler. Still, it has surely left a mark in the universe. And as the characters in the meme twitch into the abyss that is the sky, this meme will disappear into whatever internet abyss swallowed MySpace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past February, the Undergraduate Council approved a motion to allocate $1,000 for a month-long pilot program that would make tampons and related products more readily available in freshman dorms. By doing so, the UC has pioneered legislation that finally acknowledges a need of many students on campus that all too often goes ignored. While we commend the UC for their impetus, the legislation is financially, geographically, and temporally narrow in scope solely due to their limited authority, and we urge administrators with greater means to tackle this challenge themselves. As basic hygiene products are the right of every College student, it is time that the University itself assume the responsibility of distributing these necessities throughout the entire campus.
Easy access to pads and tampons has the potential to improve the quality of life for a large portion of the school’s population. Harvard already distributes other necessities such as toilet paper free of charge; including feminine hygiene products would simply be an extension of the services that are already uncontroversially provided. Moreover, University-provided feminine hygiene products would significantly decrease the financial burden that they pose for many students. Individuals across the country currently pay up to $70 to $100 a year on tampons and pads. This onus is only exacerbated by the premiums that students must potentially pay when purchasing small quantities from convenience stores such as CVS.
Students would reap the benefits of wider availability—it would help to curtail the potential stressors that students face during sudden instances of urgent necessity. If the time and anguish associated with obtaining these products is decreased, students will have more freedom to focus on improving their educational experience at the University.
Students at Harvard and college campuses across the country have already demonstrated the importance of treating feminine hygiene products as a necessity rather than a luxury. Last September, Brown University made headlines when its Undergraduate Council of Students decided to provide free tampons and sanitary napkins free of charge in women’s, gender inclusive, and men’s bathrooms in the college’s nonresidential buildings. On Harvard’s own campus, the Hygiene Campaign Club tackles issues of feminine care at the College and in the City of Cambridge. Earlier this month, the club collected signatures for a petition to provide free menstrual hygiene products in the upperclassmen houses. Moreover, the UC proposal for feminine hygiene products in first-year dorms passed with a unanimous vote.
As students have already demonstrated their support for this endeavor, Harvard must take the next step in responding to these growing requests. The financial burden to cover the costs of this program must come under the University’s budget rather than that of the UC’s. Doing so would grant the financial stability required for the imperative long-term implementation and larger scale of this program. Moving forward, the University administration should consult students on how they would like this initiative to be implemented. Students can provide further information on the locations that would best increase accessibility as well as the specific products that they prefer.
The taboo nature of menstruation does not erase its pertinence to student health in our community; the need for feminine hygiene products is not going away anytime soon. If the University believes in creating an equitable institution, it must begin to treat feminine hygiene products as a right rather than a privilege.

I caved into peer pressure. I saw “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”—just like everyone else in the world—when it hit theaters in December. I didn’t want to go (pause for horrified gasp) because there would be blasters and giant Death Stars and lightsaber duels and reluctant heroes and endearing aliens and the Force and in the end everything would work out exactly like it should. Good would conquer evil, and George Lucas would pocket my cash. Turns out, I was right (minus the lightsaber duels).
The only surprising part of the movie was the previews. Every trailer teased a franchise movie. Sure, I expected a Marvel preview or two (you can’t seem to escape them nowadays), but every single trailer? “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2”! “Pirates of the Caribbean 5: Dead Men Tell No Tales”! “Transformers 5: The Last Knight”! (It’s a wonder Hasbro Studios hasn’t been sued for false advertising; I thought the last “Transformers” movie had heralded the “age of extinction.”) It was a mind-numbing barrage of banality as I sat waiting to see the eighth installment of the Star Wars Saga: Attack of the Franchise.
Sprawling multi-media behemoths have become the norm of today’s entertainment scene. The Marvel Cinematic Universe—with 21 films, 30 TV shows, and who knows how many action figures—has grossed over $10,909,062,400 in the nine years since “Iron Man.” Star Wars has netted $7,604,654,505 in its 42 years of operation, Harry Potter a modest $8,533,398,468. With “Batman vs. Superman” and “Suicide Squad,” DC Comics is following the trend. Oh, I forgot to mention the desperate let’s-split-the-final-movie-into-two-parts franchise-bid of Twilight and Hunger Games. Thor help us!
There’s a reason these franchises work. They’re familiar, sometimes to the point of nostalgia. We feel comfortable with the characters, villains, music, visuals, and storylines. We know what to expect. I buy the same cereal every time I go to CVS because I don’t have the time or money to risk anything other than Honey Bunches of Oats. Am I really going to gamble a Friday night on some mysterious stand-alone film I might not like?
But there’s danger in complacency, for both the artist and the audience alike. Plot lines become repetitive excuses for another jackpot blockbuster. “The Force Awakens” become “A New Hope” with a female lead and better special effects. Spider-Man gets three reboots in 15 years. A new alien (even more powerful than the last) invades the world and we need another swaggering hero team with good looks and clever quips to take him down. Artistic quality is sacrificed for box office quantities. Plot lines are stretched, characters contorted, and the same banal themes rehashed ad nauseam because a familiar brand keeps the audience coming back for more. Innovative filmmakers are pushed from the market, and audiences are neither intellectually challenged nor artistically intrigued. Jaded movie franchises are coasting on their brand names to commercial triumph.
Established in impregnable popularity, these films don’t need to be good anymore. We’re all going to see the next Avengers movie because it’s the next Avengers movie. It’s become a cultural staple. Massive success has introduced moral hazard into the film industry, threatening the creativity, novelty, and authenticity that made that success possible in the first place. Brand-name films are riding their own momentum into mediocrity.
Is the same thing happening at Harvard?
We were accepted into this college as students who, according to the admissions website, “stretch [ourselves],” “[work] to capacity,” and “have initiative” through our passions. But now that we’re in, now that we’ve made it here, it’s tempting to ride the Harvard brand to victory (especially with a 98 percent graduation rate). It’s tempting to give a decent effort in classes and extracurricular activities, finish with a decent GPA, have fun on the side, and let the Harvard diploma do the rest. One of my Class of 2020 peers said it best over dinner in Annenberg: “A Harvard degree is the best insurance policy you can have.” Choosing a concentration, challenging yourself, and producing high-quality work doesn’t matter. Harvard is a franchise, and the brand name ensures your commercial success.
But is that why we’re here? To sit comfortably on a world-renowned name? The Harvard brand isn’t a security—it’s an opportunity. The insurance of established success should make us more willing to innovate, take risks, and push our intellectual capacities. It should encourage us to stay true to the character and attitudes that got us in. After all, if Harvard produces complacent graduates instead of dynamic scholars, it will risk losing the exceptional standards that made its name great to begin with. We didn’t apply to a name. We applied to a school.
Complacency is an easy―even reasonable―habit. If it weren’t, Star Wars and Marvel movies would be substantially more interesting. The trick for today’s Harvard students will be using established success as a springboard for even greater achievement, not as an excuse to settle for mediocrity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: I have 39 cousins—my sisters and I counted when I was home last winter break. We got through the cousins living in the United States pretty easily. They were counted on the hands my youngest sister held up. Ten slender, brown fingers. The rest of our cousins live in El Salvador, and most of their educational goals fall by the wayside when there’s livestock to be fed and farms to be tended to. To them, Harvard is nothing but a hollow, insignificant name of some university in the United States.
Zoe: When I was in the third grade, I’d catch the school bus down the street at 5:45 a.m. when the sky wasn’t even thinking of brightening to welcome a new day. I’d travel for an hour and a half with the sun rising behind us as we ate up miles upon miles of black asphalt on freeways that, like the yellow brick road, would end in a completely different place from anything I had ever known. My own Oz was a school for gifted and talented students, dominated by white and Asian upper-middle-class residents on the west side of town. To say it was different from the predominantly Latino and low-income elementary school I was zoned to on the east side is an understatement. Despite the fact that Houston had a sizable Latino population at the time, I was the only Latina in my entire grade for three years before I got to middle school.
R: But the forgotten ones are everywhere. If you are Latinx in this country, the numbers are not stacked in your favor. Latinx Americans have the highest high school dropout rates of any ethnic group. In 2014, only 15 percent of Latinx people aged 25 to 29 had a bachelor’s degree or higher, lagging behind every other ethnic group in this category as well. When asked why they entered the workforce or enrolled in the military instead of going to college, 66 percent of people cited their need to support their family. The pressure to provide, a bittersweet mix of machismo and racial expectation, keeps too many Latino men out of the classroom. That’s how they become the Forgotten Ones.
Z: I often wonder how different my life would have been if I hadn’t been in classrooms with peers who competed in international chess competitions, used big words regularly, and talked about college like it was a guaranteed destination. I learned how to speak like a “white girl”—a synonym often used to imply someone who speaks properly—because my mom knew the only way I would find an environment that cultivated and pushed my success was to leave my community’s schools. But that can’t be the answer, we shouldn’t have to leave our communities behind to guarantee a good education and a successful future. Other Latinx students shouldn’t be doomed to remain in classrooms that are falling apart, with teachers who are underpaid, where the students destined for a better place, the ones destined to get out, to go to college, to have the chance to see the world outside of where they grew up, are too few and far between. Maybe it's because the majority of school funding comes from property taxes and 30 percent of the low-income families in the United States are Latino. It makes me wonder how will my community succeed in a country that doesn’t believe they truly are the future.
R: So, we write a column. Although they may be hard to find, we take classes on Latinidad and pontificate about what we learn. We quote Anzaldúa, spit social theory, and chew on the wordy texts of academics. We come up with answers for the problems we’ve diagnosed in the Latinx community. In our heads, we’re doing God’s work but, suddenly, the realization that we are the select few—the glowing brown chosen ones—comes crashing down on us. There’s no purpose in learning or scheming or brainstorming the best ways to help your community if you run so far away from them in order to do so.
Z: To make it, I had to break from the community that shaped me, learn to speak a different way, quote Nietzsche, and have history lessons about phenomena that resulted in our oppression. I’m constantly asked if I’ll go back, asked if I’ll fulfill my responsibility to better my community after I get my degree. Yet, I can’t help but feel that this problem is bigger than just me. It is imperative to have successful people of color in the world, who can be role models for others, but it is also important to understand that many of these successful individuals have been afforded privileges that should be universal guarantees to all students of color. I got to Harvard not just because I was lucky, not just because I worked hard, but because I had certain privileges that allowed me to reach for the high places this university represents. I had a mom who spoke English and understood the inequality of education in Houston, which is something that not all Latinx students can say. The Forgotten Ones, the majority of Latinos who did not make it here or to a college degree, were created by a society that continues to ignore the unique needs of disenfranchised students. These needs must be addressed through concrete policy and they need to be remembered by more than just the lucky ones.
R: By coming to Harvard, we inherently become detached from the communities that propelled us here. We lose a sense of ourselves in our attempts to navigate an institution based in whiteness. It’s the price we pay, one much larger than any tuition sticker price, when we accept our admission. When we’re forced to detach in order to survive, we ourselves begin to forget the forgotten ones. We will graduate with Harvard degrees, two shining examples of what Latinx success can look like, but that should not exempt us from helping the Latinx communities all over this country—the ones that are not writing this column, the ones whose backs break under systemic oppression, and the ones who may be so tempting to forget but don’t deserve to be forgotten.

Former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter will join the faculty at the Harvard Kennedy School at the end of the academic year as the director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and a professor of technology and global affairs.
Carter, who was previously a professor at the Kennedy School, will return to Cambridge after a series of  gifts from frequent donors Robert and Renée Belfer. One of their gifts will be used to endow Carter’s new position at the helm of the Belfer Center.
During his tenure as Secretary of Defense, which lasted from 2015 to the end of the Obama administration, Carter led American efforts against ISIS, dealt with the ramifications of Russian aggression in Ukraine, and opened combat positions to women.
In his role at the Belfer Center and as a professor, Carter will teach courses and work with student researchers.
“I like to teach and I like students. I’m not one of these faculty members who doesn’t want to be with students. That’s the whole point,” Carter said in an interview with The Crimson.
Carter said returning to the Kennedy School will provide him with opportunities to continue to working with young people on topics of national defense.
“Two months ago I ended what was a 35-year career in national defense as Secretary of Defense and among the many day-to-day challenges and wars I was always mindful, as Secretary of Defense, of the future,” Carter said. “That comes from two ingredients: great technology and spectacular young people in a volunteer force. I wanted in my next career to combine those things to a degree, namely technological innovation and the next generation.”
The cornerstone of Carter’s work in the classroom and in research will be the role technology and innovation plays in national security.
“His focus will be on innovation and how innovation can help keep our country and other countries safer,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said.
Other Belfer gifts will be used for increasing financial aid, research initiatives and policy engagement by faculty members. Elmendorf declined to disclose the size of the gifts.
Following his inauguration, President Donald Trump unveiled a proposed budget slashing funding to research in the sciences, arts and humanities while bolstering funding for the Department of Defense. The cuts have worried professors across the University who rely on federal funding for research. Carter said he shares some of these concerns.
“I do believe that we make good use of the defense dollars that we’re given and we need them, but I’m a staunch believer equally in the importance of public funding for research and development and for execution and training, infrastructure,” Carter said. “I believe the Secretary of Defense needs to stick up for all of those parts of the federal budget as important for national defense.”
Carter’s appointment at the Kennedy School is the latest in a string of academic appointments for former Obama administration officials. Earlier this year, the University of Pennsylvania announced former Vice President Joe Biden would be joining the faculty to lead the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Michelle Obama’s former chief speechwriter, Sarah Hurwitz, currently serves as a fellow at the Institute of Politics.
Former Secretary of State John Kerry will also coming to the Kennedy School this year, albeit briefly, to deliver the school’s graduation address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Administrators from the Office of Student Life say they are speaking with undergraduate leaders of unrecognized single-gender social organizations as OSL staff forge ahead on a committee to review a policy penalizing the groups.
David R. Friedrich, the College’s associate dean of students, said he has met with leaders of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations to discuss the possibility of the groups becoming “inclusive” social organizations.
“We continue to have individual conversations—and doors open—to all the groups that have been, to this point, USGSOs, and we want to be able to talk with them with their own specific circumstances,” Friedrich said. “All of these groups are in different places in how they’re thinking about this policy and any potential changes they might consider.”
In May 2016, the College announced a historic policy penalizing members of single-gender final clubs, fraternities, and sororities. Starting with the Class of 2021, members of these groups may be ineligible for certain scholarships, fellowships, and leadership positions across campus.
The committee tasked with recommending steps for the policy’s implementation has released their suggestions, but a faculty committee—with both Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair among its members—now stands to potentially undo it.
O’Dair described her role on the faculty review committee as listening to the perspectives of both faculty and students on the policy. Across the College, the penalties have been polarizing, with some lauding Harvard’s efforts to curb gender discrimination and others criticizing the policy for including all-female groups.
“I absolutely see my role as, in particular, thinking about the student experience and what it will look like,” O’Dair said.
The review committee will analyze whether the proposed penalties “can be improved, either by changing aspects of its existing structure or through some broader revision,” and will submit its final recommendations to Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

State politicians and health care executives from around Massachusetts gathered at the Kennedy School to grapple with possible changes to health care policy under President Donald Trump’s administration Tuesday. 
Around a dozen attendees voiced opinions on a Trump-sponsored health care bill that—in a significant victory for the Affordable Care Act—Republicans pulled from consideration in the U.S. House of Representatives Friday. Trump repeatedly promised to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act throughout his presidential campaign, and often voiced qualms with the policy, one of former President Barack Obama's major initiatives.
The Affordable Care Act currently insures millions of Americans, including hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents.
Audrey J. Shelto, president of Massachusetts’s Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation, said had the bill passed, it would have had widespread ramifications for Mass. residents.
“The House bill that got pulled on Friday was going to have a major, major impact on coverage for vulnerable people in Massachusetts,” she said. “We really dodged a huge bullet on Friday, but it is definitely not over.”
Steven M. Walsh, who directs Mass.’s Council of Community Hospitals, a non-profit that ensures quality care at public hospitals across the state, said he agreed with Shelto. He added he still remains afraid for the future of health care.
“My trepidation has not ended. Since Friday, it has actually increased. I think that it would be a mistake if we were to relax,” he said. “We’re entering into a phase with total unpredictability by somebody who absolutely writes legislation with vitriol.”
Panelists spoke at length about various ways to improve the Affordable Care Act by cutting costs. Shelto said the federal government should ensure quality housing for more Americans in addition to providing public health care.
“A study was able to show that providing [housing], which of course takes up-front investment, the ambulance visits go down, ER admissions go down, the re-admissions go down,” she said.
Walsh added that he thinks the government should better promote healthy behavior on a smaller scale.
“Let’s pay them to be healthy and pay them to make the right choices. That is far, far less expensive than the cost on the other end, if they make the wrong choices,” he said.
The event, organized by the Kennedy School’s Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, was also attended by Mass. State Senator William N. Brownsberger ’78. Brownsberger said after the event that he found the conversation “helpful.”
“We’ve got some great minds here at the Kennedy School and they do a great job bringing practitioners together to talk about what is going on,” Brownsberger said.

UPDATED: March 29, 2017 at 7:56 a.m. 
Harvard has launched the Data Science Initiative, a University-wide program that aims to bring together data scientists in different fields.
The primary objective of this program is to bridge disciplines and promote collaboration across Harvard through data science, according to a press release.
“This initiative will connect research efforts across the University in this emerging field. It will facilitate cross-fertilization in both teaching and research, paving the way to methodological innovations and to applications of these new tools to a wide range of societal and scientific challenges,” University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said in the press release.
The initiative is led by  Francesca Dominici, a biostatistics professor at the School of Public Health, and David C. Parkes, a computer science professor and dean at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. It is also guided by a Data Science Steering Committee consisting of seven professors, directors, and chairs from across the University, in addition to Dominici and Parkes.
“My ambition is to bring both the junior faculty and postdoctoral fellows who are working in data science across the university to connect with each other,” Dominici said. “[We want] to empower and enable them to be impactful in their respective fields of research.”
Dominici said that the new program will work closely with the Statistics department. She hopes the program will bolster the department and help facilitate future hiring.
“The goal is to make the existing departments stronger and more competitive to hire the best possible talent," Dominici said. "By having a cross-discipline platform, the goal is to facilitate and empower these departments to hire better candidates.”
Starting in fall 2017, the Initiative will host a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in data science. It will also sponsor a competitive research fund for projects “whose interests span all areas of data science,” according to the press release.
At the most recent Faculty meeting, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved a master’s degree in Data Science offered jointly by Computer Science and Statistics and slated to begin in fall 2018. The University also recently approved master's programs Biomedical Informatics and Health Data Science, hosted by the Medical School and the School of Public Health respectively.
“The ability to apply the power of new analytics and new methodologies in revolutionary ways makes this the era of data science and Harvard faculty have been at the forefront of this emerging field,” Vice Provost for Research Richard D. McCullough said in the press release.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Planning and Development Agency held a public meeting Tuesday to discuss rezoning in the $200 million redevelopment of an 11.6-acre site in Brighton currently home to the abandoned St. Gabriel’s Church and Monastery.
In May 2016, real estate developer Cabot, Cabot & Forbes submitted a letter of intent to build 679 housing units on the property “to serve graduate students and others engaged in teaching, training and research” and to “free up local housing for permanent neighborhood residents.”
According to a report from the City of Boston, more than 4,100 graduate students lived in private rental housing in Brighton during the 2015-2016 academic year. Nearby schools include Harvard, Boston University, and Boston College.
While the proposed project involves the construction of new buildings, it will restore and retain some existing features, including the currently-abandoned St. Gabriel’s.
In a meeting with local government officials and residents of Allston and Brighton on Monday, executives from Cabot, Cabot & Forbes responded to resident concerns by proposing an additional 15 condominium units to include a total of 100 condos. John Sullivan, the firm’s executive vice president, said his team is “focused on getting final feedback and answering questions and making changes.”
Sullivan added that he found residents concerned about a lack of diversity in housing type, especially since many home ownership rates in Allston and Brighton are relatively low. “They want to see a balance and that’s what we’ve been working on,” he said.
As part of this review phase of the project, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes is offering an online platform on which residents may comment.
On this platform, resident John Quatrale wrote, “The newly revised plan for the redevelopment of St. Gabriel’s shows that the developers have been listening and responding to neighborhood residents.... The historic rehabilitation of the Monastery, one of only of five City of Boston Landmarks in Allston-Brighton is especially exciting.”
Sullivan said that the historical preservation of the various historical landmarks, including an Olmsted Brothers-designed park, makes this project “exciting and unique” and has garnered the support of the Boston Preservation Alliance.
Since buying the land from St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, Cabot, Cabot & Forbes has attempted to rezone the site to expand a “conservation protection subdistrict” to preserve existing green space around the monastery.
At the meeting, residents said they were concerned about whether the conservation protection districts would conserve surrounding land. Others emphasized the difficulties of juggling Allston and Brighton’s ongoing housing development projects. 
Currently in Allston, representatives from grocery store Stop & Shop recently submitted a letter of intent to build an additional 1,000 housing units. Residents said it may be easy for each company’s individual plan to get overlooked.
Other housing developments also include those proposed in the Harvard Institutional Master Plan. In addition to the building a complex at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a Life Lab, the Harvard proposal includes community benefit plans with subsidized housing near SEAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
United States Attorney General Jeff B. Sessions announced Monday that cities—including Cambridge—that call themselves “sanctuaries” for undocumented immigrants will lose funding from the Department of Justice, prompting outcry from Cambridge city officials.
Despite pressure from the federal government, Cambridge has maintained its label as a “sanctuary city,” meaning it permits undocumented residents to live in the city and avoid deportation. Sessions said Monday that sanctuary policies “make their cities and states less safe” and “put them at risk of losing federal dollars.”
The DOJ grants currently provide $4.1 billion nationwide for law enforcement programs, and Cambridge would be withheld from such grants.
Cambridge Mayor E. Denise Simmons released a statement Monday denouncing Sessions’s announcement. She and a number of other city officials previously spoke out in defense of sanctuary cities after President Donald Trump’s initial Jan. 25 order to withhold funding, and her Monday statement was similarly harsh.
“That does not make it any less irresponsible or disgraceful that the federal government would continue to push for punitive and heartless actions like this one,” Simmons wrote. “The President and Attorney General are not going to make this country safer by withholding funds for critical services like affordable housing programs and Meals on Wheels; instead, they will be hurting the most vulnerable among us.”
City Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen also criticized the new administration’s plans to force cities to fulfill federal officials’ immigration actions on their behalf.
“An attempt to do so is brazenly unconstitutional, which is very much in keeping with Trump’s strategy,” Mazen said. “Grasp for something that is undermining American values, fly in the face of the Constitution hoping you’ll get away with something, and subvert American values in order to terrorize and attack those who are otherwise peaceful, law-abiding, and great beacons of support and diversity in our communities.”
City Councillor Jan Devereux said Cambridge will continue to resist Trump’s new policy.
“Cambridge won't be bullied into changing our commitment to protecting the human and civil rights of all our residents regardless of their immigration status,” Devereux wrote in an emailed statement. “We believe the way to create a safer community for all residents is by building trust, not building walls.”
Some sanctuary cities have fought the federal policies in court, and Mazen said he suspects Cambridge or Massachusetts could join such suits. But for now, Cambridge continues to observe the legal battles, recognizing that civil society organizations and larger cities and states are taking action, according to Mazen.
“I think that Cambridge will continue to do its utmost to participate when and if we are needed to lead,” he said. “I think in this case there are many other cities leading and we are in a position of planning, observing, and collaborating, and will continue to do so.”

Experts in criminal justice policy discussed the phenomenon of mass incarceration in the United States at the Divinity School Tuesday night, focusing on its racial, moral, and ethical implications on the lives of prisoners.
The four panelists at the event—each of whom had either professional or academic experience with the criminal justice system—discussed the conditions prisoners often face as well as the skewed demographics of the incarcerated population.
Paul Shoaf-Kozak, the chaplain of Essex Correctional Facility, opened the conversation. He said euphemisms, such as “solitary confinement” and “mass incarceration,” obscure the severity of punishments and life in prison. Kozak said adverse prison conditions can “trigger psychopathologies” that lead to abnormal behavior.
Shoaf-Kozak said families in particular suffer from mass incarceration.
“A person is excised from society, from their family,” Shoaf-Kozak said. “Very infrequently is it a drawn-out arrest. Someone usually walks down the street, gets stopped, and all of a sudden, they’re not home.”
Though the majority of prisoners in the United States are male, Shoaf-Kozak said women are “disproportionately affected” by mass incarceration.
“They end up carrying the burden for having to care for people who end up in jail,” he said. “Roughly 95 percent of the visitors to prisoners are women—mothers, aunts, grandmothers, sisters.”
Vincent Schiraldi, a senior fellow for the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management at the Kennedy School and the former director of juvenile corrections in Washington, D.C., spoke about solitary confinement for juveniles, drawing attention to the potential for abuse of minors in the system.
Schiraldi said gross neglect across correctional facilities are the norm, even in prisons in the nation’s capital.
Dehlia I. Umunna, professor at the Law School and Deputy Director of the Criminal Justice Institute, said racial bias lies behind many arrests. Umunna said her experience as a mother of two black children made the issue especially personal.
“When I see my thirteen-year old… and I see him spewing out facts, I wonder whether police officers see what I see—a boy with so much potential and who is so smart,” she said. “Or do police just see a tall black kid, who in their mind, is up to no good?”
Schiraldi said he had also observed racial bias in the criminal justice system during his time at the juvenile facilities in D.C.
“This is a moral outrage. [The facilities were] full of kids of color,” he said.
Shoaf-Kozak added that the U.S. and Massachusetts continue to incarcerate poor people of color at disproportionately high rates.
Kaia Stern, director of the Prison Studies Project at Harvard and lecturer at the Graduate School of Education, spoke about importance of the issue.
“There is no more glaring threat to human rights or testing of democracy than our current punishment crisis,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking to a full house at the Institute of Politics, former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter discussed military cooperation with the tech industry, artificial intelligence, and his career at the Defense Department.
Carter served the Department of Defense for 35 years in various roles, most recently as Defense Secretary under the Obama administration. Appointed after Charles T. Hagel's resignation in 2015, Carter led the department through the end of Obama’s presidency. At the end of the academic year, he will join the Kennedy School as director of the Belfer Center for International Affairs.
“This new job has the mission to which I want to dedicate the next phase of my life,” Carter said of his new role.
Carter started his career as a physicist, receiving his B.A. in Physics and Medieval History from Yale in 1976. Carter later studied at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar, receiving a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the school in 1979.
“I was one of those student who… came out of a public school in Philadelphia—no preppy distractions. It was just ‘I’m paying the money, I’m gonna get the education,’” Carter said.
Carter spoke of the importance of military research and development spending, citing technologies and innovations that have arisen from military technologies later picked up by the tech industry.
He emphasized his desire to “build bridges and make connections” with the tech industry to partner for the public good.
“The spirit is there, with many innovators, but the bridge to connect them to public projects is not,” Carter said.
Asked by one attendee about artificial intelligence, Carter contrasted the private development of AI to the public development of nuclear equipment in the 40's and 50's. He said the military will be unable to control the dissemination of artificial intelligence like it could for nuclear weapons.
“AI as a technology… will take place in the private sector,” Carter said. “Fortunately nobody has privatized nuclear weapons.”
Carter listed what he described as the five primary defense issues facing the country in the near future:  destroying ISIL, countering Russian aggression, maintaining stability in the Asian Pacific, checking Iran’s influence in the Gulf, and deterring North Korea.
Domestically, one of Carter's historic decisions at the Department of Defense was his opening of all combat positions in the military to women, a decision which received both support and criticism from service members and the public.
“I [opened all combat positions to women] because 50 percent of the population is just not something an all-volunteer force can afford to waste,” Carter said of the decision.
General Jim Mattis, the newly-appointed Defense Secretary under President Trump, has publicly said he will not overturn Carter’s decision or the 2011 repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policies.

The College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life reaffirmed its support for transgender students ahead of a scheduled campus visit Thursday from an anti-transgender “Free Speech Bus.”
Co-sponsored by conservative action groups the National Organization for Marriage, Citizen Go, and the International Organization for the Family, the bus is intended to to promote a “renewed policy debate [on transgender issues] that tries to accommodate for everyone,” according to Joseph Grabowski, director of communications for the National Organization for Marriage. The vehicle will travel to Boston and Harvard’s campus on Thursday as part of its larger tour through the East Coast.
Featured prominently on the side of the bus, in bold-letter font, are the words: “It’s Biology: Boys are boys… and always will be. Girls are girls... and always will be. You can’t change sex.”
In response to the bus’s scheduled visit, the BGLTQ Office hosted a banner signing event Tuesday afternoon, where students stopped by the Office’s Linden St. quarters and added their names to a sign reading “Trans Lives Matter.” The banner will be hung in the Science Center Plaza Thursday, according to Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, the director of the office.
“We'll be hanging the banner in the Science Center Plaza as a visible message of support for the trans community at Harvard and…to provide a counter-message to the rhetoric offered by the bus,” Scarborough wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday.
Scarborough also emailed a “Message of Support” to BGLTQ undergraduates over the weekend.
“Whether or not this bus shows up on campus this week, we will still be here,” Scarborough wrote. “Our lives are the punctuation mark on this debate, because at the end of the day, queer, and trans, and gender non-binary people exist.”
“No message on a bus can cast a shadow on the radiant spectrum of light that is the awesome diversity of our human experience,” Scarborough added.
Adams House BGLTQ resident tutors prepared for the “Free Speech Bus” by hosting a “supportive space” for students to “come together” Tuesday evening.
As of late Tuesday afternoon, the “Trans Lives Matter” banner had garnered more than 80 student and administrator signatures. Lily M. Velona ’18, who signed the banner, said, “I think it’s terrible—it’s purposeful that this bus is calling itself a ‘Free Speech Bus.’”
“I’ve been seeing lot of this as of late, where people are conflating free speech and hate speech,” Velona added. “Hate speech is not protected speech. It’s not free speech. No one has the right to use hate speech.”
Benjamin M. Kruteck ’19, who also signed the banner, said he chose to add his name because he wanted to show support for his transgender peers.
“It’s a sense of being, being trans is a sense of being, and so it’s important to support people in who they are and I don’t understand why anyone wouldn’t,” Kruteck said. “So for me it’s important to sign because I want to represent the fact that I support people being who they are.”

Traditionally all-female final clubs and sororities will be allowed to retain their “gender focus” for the next few years—and potentially beyond that period—while complying with the College’s policy penalizing single-gender social groups, according to Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich.
In an interview Tuesday, Friedrich clarified the details of a three to five year “bridge” program for all-female social organizations proposed by a committee tasked with implementing the College’s penalties against single-gender social groups.
In a report released on March 6, the committee wrote that it “supports the idea of continuing to allow the female final clubs and sororities to operate with gender focused missions, with the understanding that the positive contributions of those organizations to the campus community would be assessed in three to five years.”
Having accepted nearly all of the committee’s recommendations, including the proposed bridge program, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a College-wide email that he agreed that historical inequalities faced by women at the College may require additional resources to aid all-female groups in transitioning into “inclusive organizations.”
“I will consult with the Dean of Students and the Committee on Student Life on how to best support a vigorous and non-discriminatory social experience responsive to the realities that our students… are not all starting from the same place,” Khurana wrote in an email.
Days after the historic policy—which may make undergraduates in single-gender social groups ineligible for some scholarships, fellowships, and leadership positions—was unveiled in May 2016, hundreds of Harvard women took to Harvard Yard to protest it. Demonstrators criticized the College for what they described as an unfair targeting of spaces for women.
On Tuesday, Friedrich said that the Office of Student Life is “available” and has its “doors open” to social groups that want to access to resources given to recognized student groups—including access to on-campus space, funding for social events, and the ability to co-sponsor events—and be a “part of the social experience on campus in a more visible way.”
“What we’re doing right now, and what we want to be able to do, is to talk directly with individual groups,” he said. “I think what we found in this process is that each organization is in their own space on where they are in their thinking about gender inclusion.”
Friedrich clarified, however, that any groups’ gender-focused mission should exist simultaneously with “substantive advancement toward full inclusion,” including gender inclusivity. Since their unveiling in May, College administrators have touted the social group penalties as potential solutions to gender discrimination at Harvard.
Lulu S. Chua-Rubenfeld ’18, the president of the formerly all-female Sab Club, wrote in a statement that the Sab is “definitely willing to work with the OSL,” and “eager to see what kind of provisional benefits [the OSL] has in mind.”
She added, “I think that the benefits and the bridge period—while the latter doesn’t apply to us—are good steps in acknowledging the different circumstances traditionally female organizations have undergone and the obstacles they’ve faced on a variety of levels.”
After the bridge period is over, Friedrich added that the continued ability for social groups to retain a gender-focused mission that is in line with the College’s policy will be subject to further review.
“I think that’s precisely what the Committee on Student Life is going to have to look at,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 30, 2017 at 12:04 p.m. 
Around 20 members of Divest Harvard blockaded entrances to University Hall Wednesday in protest of Harvard’s stance on investing in the coal industry.
The students blocked entrances to the building, which houses dozens of the University’s top administrators including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith. At 4:30 p.m., around 30 people gathered for a rally in Harvard Yard before the protesters dispersed for the day.
“We are just going to shut down business as usual,” Isa C. Flores-Jones ’19, a member of the group, said at the start of the day. Several Harvard University Police Department officers maintained a presence near University Hall and Massachusetts Hall as the blockade continued through the afternoon.
The environmental activism group is demanding a “moratorium” on Harvard’s investments in the coal industry and for a University-wide meeting to discuss general fossil fuel divestment. Harvard does not currently have any investments in coal for financial reasons, though it has not ruled out re-investing in the future.
At the blockade and in materials disseminated to press, the group repeatedly referenced President Donald Trump’s administration, which earlier this week announced plans to unravel the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era federal policy that requires power plants to drastically reduce their carbon emissions. Divest called Harvard’s continued investment in the fossil fuel industry an “implicit encouragement of Trump’s dirty energy agenda” in a statement.
Disagreement exists over what role the University should take in combating climate change, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement on the blockade.
“Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, and dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint,” she wrote.
University President Drew G. Faust has also repeatedly echoed that objection, arguing that Harvard can better combat climate change through its research and that divestment could harm the health of the University’s $35.7 billion endowment, which drew paltry returns on its investments in fiscal year 2016.
Divest originally planned to blockade Massachusetts Hall—which houses the offices of Faust and other administrators—last week. Divest postponed the demonstration until this week.
Protesters took to the Yard before dawn Wednesday morning amid brisk temperatures and a steady misting of rain, equipped with blankets and warm drinks. They stayed there throughout the day, occasionally chatting with passing tourists and supportive faculty members.
“We’re here because fundamentally coal and fossil fuels are not the future,” Jonah C. Hahn ’17 said to the a crowd at the late-afternoon rally. “We’re here because Harvard as an institution is better than profiting from the degradation of our planet.”
The inhabitants of University Hall were notified of the blockade around 7:30 a.m., according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane, t Khurana spent most of the day working out of Cafe Rojo Gato in Harvard Yard, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair worked from Mather House, according to Dane.
Wednesday’s blockade is not the first time Divest Harvard protesters have obstructed University buildings. In 2015, members of the group occupied Massachusetts Hall for a week, demanding the University divest from all fossil fuels. In April 2016, police arrested four members of the group demonstrating at Harvard Management Company’s Boston offices.

­The Harvard wrestling season ended on Mar. 17, when junior Josef Johnson bowed out of the NCAA Championships.
Wrestling his third match in St. Louis, Mo., the tri-captain dropped a 7-2 decision to Taylor Lujan of Northern Iowa. That result, combined with an earlier loss to the third seed, bounced Johnson from the event.
The 174-lb. wrestler flew back to campus, unpacked his clothes, and reunited with teammates. So began the Crimson’s long offseason.
For many wrestlers, the offseason is long because it is not truly off. Freshman Hunter Ladnier can subdivide the year into four separate stages. First comes the spring, when the team trains through freestyle wrestling. During the summer and the fall, the formal preseason, athletes tune technique. Real competition arrives in the winter.
Depending how you look at it, wrestling either never stops or rarely starts. Months of practice time overshadow minutes of live action.
“We expect a lot out of each other every day,” Ladnier said. “We’re trying to break some boundaries and see how hard we can push each other.”
As taxing as the postseason may be for freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, it is even more tedious for seniors. Suddenly the offseason never ends. There’s no more recuperation—only retirement.
Senior Jeff Ott joined Johnson and Ladnier in St. Louis. Together the trio represented Harvard at the NCAA Championships, or what Ott dubbed “the biggest tournament in the world.”
Number geeks may quibble, but the captain Ott has a point. Last year, the event took place in Madison Square Garden—the birthplace of “Linsanity,” home of Spike Lee, and memorial to countless other legends.
This year’s wrestlers competed under the less vaunted rafters of the Scottrade Center, but glitz abounded. Literal fire and smoke accented weight-class finals. Close to 20,000 people watched live. ESPN carried all the matches.
Wrestling is not a sport of celebrities. But come to the NCAA Championships, and you may leave confused.
Ott and Ladnier left after the first day. Neither won a match, but both claimed vivid memories.
“We [were] excited to represent Harvard,” Ladnier said. “Obviously I wasn’t so satisfied…. There’s a lot of work to do to get me where I want to be, which is on the podium—an All-American.”
With three years left, Ladnier headlines a talented core of youngsters, many of whom will stay over the summer to train. Fellow rookie A.J. Jaffe made the All-Ivy second team at 141 lbs., and freshman Kyle Bierdumpfel posted a 12-11 record on the year, one of five wrestlers to top .500 with at least 10 contests under his belt.
The Crimson wrestles tough opponents, too. In December of 2016, the team traveled to Las Vegas and Evanston, Ill. to face top-10 competition at the Cliff Keen Invite and Midlands, respectively. These kinds of tests promise to toughen any rookies.
“We’re definitely excited,” Ladnier said. “Guys are buying into the culture and the system.”
However brightly the future shines, the last word in 2017 belongs to Ott and the group of five other seniors that shepherded Harvard through the season.
In February, the team held a banquet at which seniors gave speeches that reflected on their careers. That closed-doors meeting came before the conference tournament and set the tone for the rest of the year.
“They’re mature guys,” Ladnier said. “I don’t think their identity is necessarily tied to the sport. They’re a lot more than just wrestlers.”
Still, Ott was a wrestler until Mar. 16—the day that he exited the NCAA Championships.
He reached that point after overcoming a knee injury earlier in the spring. Ranked as a seven seed entering the conference tournament, he pulled an upset in the semifinal to ensure a berth in the NCAA Championships.
That late-season magic ran out in St. Louis, finally forcing Ott to face the reality of abrupt endings.
“After the match was over, I stayed on the mat for a second or so—just looked around at the spectacle,” Ott said. “Obviously you can’t do a ton of reflection in the moment. But I was extremely grateful for, one, being in that situation and, two, for everything that had happened to get me to that point.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team certainly has experience with close games.
In its first three matches, the Crimson saw two contests decided by one point, and Harvard dropped a one-goal game to Syracuse earlier this month before beating out Columbia by two goals last weekend.
Tuesday’s non-conference matchup against Stanford (7-2, 1-0 MPSF) at Harvard Stadium fit the pattern. Despite holding the lead for the majority of the game, the Crimson (5-4, 2-0 Ivy League) let up a goal in the final two seconds to lose by a single tally, 10-9.
“I thought we played hard,” head coach Lisa Miller said. “We combined well, we rode well, we played good defense. It was a tough one to lose.”
In the end, sloppy play and an inability to find consistency cost Harvard the result.
The Crimson committed 25 turnovers, the most it has given up in a single contest this season and twice its previous average of 12.5 per game. In a matchup that was defined by haphazard play from both sides, Stanford coughed up the ball an equal number of times.
Harvard was also plagued by foul trouble, registering 38 infractions, its second-highest single-game total of the campaign. Three of those fouls resulted in yellow cards, and the Cardinal scored on each of the resulting man-up opportunities.
The fouls and turnovers contributed to continuous back-and-forth play, with neither team able to hold onto possession for long. Five of the Crimson’s goals came on the break, immediately following Stanford turnovers or quick clear attempts by Harvard.
The volatile nature of the game was highlighted by a goal from junior attacker Eliza Guild.
Stanford was awarded a free position chance after a Crimson foul with 26:00 remaining in the second half. The Stanford shooter attempted to convert the opportunity three times and was fouled on each occasion, leading to three consecutive replays. On the final attempt, the Cardinal player blasted the ball over the net, and the resulting Harvard clear led to Guild’s score, just 20 seconds later.
Despite the Crimson skirting the free position goal, Harvard’s inconsistency and the back-and-forth style of the game were not reflected in the scoreline for much of the contest.
Stanford took an early lead, going ahead by a goal less than four minutes into the game.
Although the momentum seemed to belong to the Cardinal, senior attacker Marisa Romeo responded with a goal four minutes later to even the score.
Romeo’s score kicked off a run of three unanswered goals for Harvard, as sophomore midfielders Keeley MacAfee and Caroline Garrity each found the back of the net before a second behind-the-back finish this week from senior attacker Maeve McMahon extended the Crimson’s advantage to 4-1.
Stanford senior attacker Elizabeth Cusick snapped the Harvard streak with two goals in seven minutes, but Romeo and MacAfee each picked up a second finish to send the teams into the mid-way break with the scoreboard reading 6-3 in the Crimson’s favor.
A quick goal from the Cardinal inside the first three minutes of the second stanza cut Harvard’s favorable margin to two. However, Stanford’s wasted free position chance and Guild’s ensuing score, followed by Romeo’s third conversion of the game gave the Crimson its biggest advantage of the night at 8-4.
With 20 minutes remaining in the game, and Harvard’s lead seemingly secure, the team’s errors began to manifest themselves.
The Crimson committed 24 of its fouls in the second half, with two of the infractions drawing yellow cards and giving Stanford man-up chances. The Cardinal capitalized on both opportunities, scoring twice in a row to trim the deficit to 8-6.
With the momentum finally swinging in its favor, Stanford found the back of the Harvard net just 50 seconds after its second man-up goal, reducing the Crimson’s lead to one point.
Meanwhile, Harvard could not crack through the stifling Cardinal defense. The Crimson only managed five shots in the second period, compared to 18 for Stanford.
With Harvard’s attack severely limited, it was up to the team’s defense to try to weather the barrage of Cardinal shots. Junior goalie Meredith Brown made nine saves, including six in the second stanza.
“I think we played really well defensively,” McMahon said. “We forced them to make a lot of turnovers, and I thought our ride was really good as well.”
Brown’s heroics between the pipes wouldn’t be enough, though.
With just over six minutes left on the clock, Stanford tied the game. A minute later, the Cardinal broke through again to take the lead for the first time since it opened the scoring.
The Crimson pressed forward, looking for the equalizer, and was rewarded with just 25 seconds left in the game. McMahon collected the ball after a Stanford foul and powered a shot into the Cardinal net to drag Harvard level at 9-9.
The Crimson won the subsequent draw and pushed up the field but committed a turnover around the halfway line. Cusick ended up with the ball, which she snuck past Brown with less than two seconds on the clock to squash Harvard’s comeback attempt in heartbreaking fashion and earn her team the victory.
The Crimson has won just a single one-goal game to date, while dropping three in the early portion of the campaign.

Spring is upon us, and that means one thing: April Fools Day. If you're still extremely salty about pranks pulled on you in the past, it’s time to gear up to get your revenge.
We’ve seen some pretty bad pranks over the years (looking at you, 'Poonsters)  and there are valuable lessons to be learned from these failures. We hope that our misfortunes inspire you to prank glory. In order of least to most upsetting, we present to you the best April Fools pranks:
The “Zip Tie”
Zip tie a friend's belt loop to the back of their chair in the dining hall when they're not looking. They're devilishly hard to get off, and if you're lucky the zip tied individual will have to waddle away with the chair attached in search of scissors.
The “Grease”
Put vaseline on everything that your target owns—their math textbook, phone, water bottle—and then sit back and watch them drop things all day.
The “Orange Thrown Against The Wall”
This is exactly what it sounds like. You might be tempted to say this doesn't sound like much of a prank. And we would have to agree. But if you scream “April Fools” before smashing citrus on someone's dorm wall it makes it funny.
The “Glitter Socks”
Fill every pair of socks with glitter to create a sparkly explosion every time your target needs fresh socks.
The “Duct Tape”
This one takes a bit of work, but the payoff is incredible. Buy several rolls of duct tape, and tape everything your target owns to their ceiling.
The “Homework Scavenger Hunt”
Boy oh boy, this one will really get under the skin of your anxious classmates. Steal their backpack, with time-sensitive homework inside, hide it somewhere on campus, and create an elaborate and enigmatic scavenger hunt that must be completed in order to find it.
The “Alarm Watches”
Buy a dozen cheap alarm watches, and set them to go off every 15 minutes between 3 a.m and 6 a.m. Hide them all over your target’s room. Wish them a restful night of sleep and a happy morning of watch finding (bonus points if you sew one of the watches into their pillow or mattress).
Ultimately, there is no prank that takes it too far on April Fools Day. Help your friends grow into the thick skinned yet deeply bitter people you’ve always wanted them to be. So, Happy AF day, and get pranking!
