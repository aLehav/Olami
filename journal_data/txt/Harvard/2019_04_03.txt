After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a curious recent admit last year, I gathered information about Harvard to find out what I could expect the following fall. I only started inquiring after the regular admission results, though many other recent admits may have started thinking about student life long before I did. But now, as a second-semester freshman who is quickly finishing his first year of college, I realize that I internalized advice more than I should have.
So, perhaps somewhat ironically, here’s my advice for incoming first-years: Take the advice of current or past students with a grain of salt. First-years should arrive ready to create their own experiences, not mimicking others’.
For me, deciding what classes to take turned out to be one of the most confusing times during my first year. In the beginnings of my research, the Q-Guide system, a database for student class evaluations, allowed me to narrow down which subject I wanted to take a class in. A couple of classes in each slot seemed easy enough to decide upon given that I could reach out to past students or utilize shopping week, a week during which students can attend potential classes.
But choosing between two similar courses such as the first-year life science track Life and Physical Sciences A: “Foundational Chemistry and Biology” or Life Sciences 1a: “An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences” proved to be more difficult than I had imagined. Personally, I enjoyed being torn between one or two courses during shopping week; at least I was researching and personally trying to decipher the rumors floating around about each class. What confused me was an overload of personal advice that I received from talking with my peers. I took such advice as fact and made my decisions based off of it, bypassing my own thoughts in the decision.
It is true that a given Harvard student will share their honest opinions of a class. And I find few reasons to not trust the experiences of a student who has already taken the class. But such opinions are never objective and hidden behind every word is an underlying tone of “Yes, you should take it” or “No, you should not take it.” Subconsciously, I internalized these experiences as fact. I did wonder at times, “Why can’t students give me a matter-of-fact opinion of a class?” But I realized that such an opinion does not exist.
Opinions of a class cannot be objective because students use different criterion to reflect upon a class; oftentimes, unrelated sentiments can dramatically shift students’ views of a class such as whether a friend takes a class with them or whether they liked the personalities of those teaching the course. Looking back, asking these questions implied that I wanted to know what I should take during my first-year. But, incoming first-years should learn sooner rather than later that no one knows what is right for you but yourself.
Beyond classes, I remember having questions about extracurriculars in relation to what groups I would fit into on campus. Students seem to have an understanding of which student groups on campus incorporate significant social aspects, sometimes to equal degrees to the activities of the club itself. But these social aspects aren’t immutable. Because club enrollment and board members change year by year, clubs on campus are defined by the group of students that are currently in it, and one student’s past social experience may not be the experience that another student has the following year. Thus, I would encourage students to join a club in spite of prior conceptions.
Taking advice as fact should not be the intention of seeking it. And having the right intention when asking questions brought me to understand the merit in making decisions for myself. One of the reasons I reached out heavily to current students was to quell my worry about making the wrong choice. I will never stop asking for advice from friends, family, and advisors in making decisions because I trust them to have the best intentions for me. But, through my first year, I learned that this advice should not make my decisions. Only I can ultimately decide yes or no, and I must do this while realizing that my circumstances are unique, just like everyone’s are.
Harvard is simultaneously everything and nothing like I expected. I would have never dreamed of my first year unfolding the way that it did. However much I asked for advice or sought to learn about prior experiences, no amount of knowledge could prepare me for the curveballs of my first year. This too, is an important lesson that I am grateful to have learned.
So now, with my three years left, I could continue relying heavily on the actions of those close to me or I could rely on myself to find my own “way” through classes, extracurriculars, and college life.
I choose to trust myself, heeding to advice while knowing that I have the option to ignore it. Only then will Harvard be a truly special experience. And so — for incoming first-years — you can start being cautious about what advice you take by heeding mine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a saying that goes, “There are two kinds of Harvard students: pointy students and round students.” This may sound a little weird, but after I first heard this analogy in freshman year, the Harvard landscape started to make a whole lot more sense to me. The saying suggests a pointy person is someone whose skills all funnel into one very specific point of interest. They earned their way through the grueling admissions process mostly, but not exclusively, because they have a unique, honed skill that sets them apart from the pack. These students are the musical savants or mathematical geniuses among us. Maybe Greg’s college essay wasn’t quite up to snuff, but he’s the international chess champion and brings a unique set of skills to the table.
A round person, on the other hand, doesn’t necessarily excel at one particular skill, but they’re fairly well equipped in a large number of areas. Katie can write a killer paper, perform complex calculations, and took piano lessons for a few years growing up. Her work may not be publishing ready yet, and she may not be starring in her own concierto, but she has a diverse set of talents.
Since the Harvard admissions trial began, and truthfully for quite some time before it, conversation has been abuzz about what makes an applicant “Harvard material.” Particularly, I have heard many students question whether student athletes fit the bill. In truth, however, athletes are pointy students like any other, and therefore do not deserve the position they’ve held in the discussion regarding Harvard’s admissions practices.
The unsatisfying truth is that there is no formula for a successful application to Harvard. Harvard seems to seek out pointy people and round people alike, and the standards for those categories are likely quite different. This distinction makes it near impossible to define a set list of necessary characteristics for a potential Harvard student because the admissions team values diverse talents among its students.
Throughout the admissions conversation, athletes have been unfairly grouped into the class of admitted students which includes legacies and children of donors. The tacit belief among many I have spoken to is that this portion of the student body constitute evidence of unfair admission standards, implying that they did not earn their spots at this school as other students did. Moreover, some believe these students are taking the spots of other, worthier candidates because they held this unfair advantage.
Athletes do not deserve to be lumped into this category. Athletes are pointy. Their uniquely honed skill is their athletic ability. I am not suggesting that athletes don’t have a multitude of other talents as well, they surely do, but those who were recruited were specifically selected because their athletic talent is a unique skill the University values. It makes just as much sense to consider athletic accomplishment in admissions as it does to consider if a student published a novel before they were 16 years old. Both are special qualifications that could make for a fitting addition to the Harvard community.
The talents, abilities, and mindsets brought to the student body by athletes aid in diversifying the College. Those who play team sports might be able to help infuse a group project with the values of cooperation and teamwork. A student who is accustomed to studying alone could truly benefit from their group-mate’s experience in working as a unit. A victory celebration after a big game, if made open and inclusive to other members of the student body, could provide a reprieve from studying for the student who had four midterms and a paper last week. Including students with different priorities, backgrounds, experiences, and values is crucial to making this campus a place where students can meet and learn from those unlike themselves.
This campus doesn’t need pointy students more than round students or vice versa. A fair mix of both contributes to making Harvard the special place that it is. Athletes are an important part of that puzzle, and they deserve to be here just as much as any other student.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The recent nationwide admissions scandal has revealed how students and families of privileged socioeconomic backgrounds are able to leverage their wealth, often in dishonest ways, to gain admission to prestigious universities. But the problem of wealth disparities extends beyond college admissions. Relative to the rest of the population, wealthy students often have unequal access to the resources and institutional knowledge that make for a positive and productive college experience. Certainly no exception, Harvard has significant work to do in making students from all socioeconomic backgrounds — particularly historically marginalized ones — feel included and empowered.
Consider Graduate School of Education professor Anthony A. Jack’s research on the socioeconomic initiatives that elite universities pursue. Jack looks at how low-income students, even those who might be termed “privileged poor” — low-income students that come from affluent private high schools — face a set of common difficulties in college. As part of his research, Jack examines how many socioeconomic initiatives, like those that allow low-income students to attend events they might not be able to afford on their own, are well-intended and largely beneficial, but make low-income students feel that they are different from and treated as less than their wealthier peers.
As we have opined in past, low-income students at Harvard are certainly no exception, and Harvard should take a hard look at how its institutions contribute to this sense of difference. While the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative has been incredibly beneficial for countless students and families, it is important to acknowledge that the problem of socioeconomic inequity runs deeper than admission and requires more comprehensive solutions than currently available.
The University, we acknowledge, will not be able to fix this societal problem on its own. Nevertheless, there are some measures that Harvard might consider on its journey toward providing the best experience possible for its low-income students.
Jack discusses how low-income students in elite colleges can feel out of place when they participate, often by necessity, in paid janitorial programs — which at Harvard translates to Dorm Crew. Rethinking work contributions like Dorm Crew and similar requirements for financial aid and the ways these interact with power dynamics could be a positive step towards addressing these issues. Many other tangible measures may include: compensating students for labor they contribute in unpaid student organizations, providing more accessible funding for food and housing on breaks, and expanding its online resources for first-generation, low-income students. Finally, Harvard should continue to pursue and prioritize student research that tries to better define the scope of this problem and enable students to tackle the issue drawing from their extensive knowledge of student life at Harvard.
Yet, students must also consider their own responsibilities in helping make Harvard a welcoming and inclusive environment. It falls upon students to be more vigilant and considerate about the way in which we recognize our privilege and interact with our peers. Universities will always be encumbered by bureaucracy, but that need not be the case for students. Change starts with us — in our classes and dining halls, pre-orientation programs and extracurricular activities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some undergraduate teaching staff said they were previously unaware of the potential impact that ongoing contract negotiations between Harvard and its new graduate student union — which represents undergraduate teaching staff — will have on eligible College students.
Roughly 450 to 500 College students who work as teaching fellows and course assistants are part of the union, constituting the largest voting bloc in the union, according to Evan MacKay '19, the sole undergraduate member of the union's bargaining team. The union, Harvard Graduate Students Union — United Automobile Workers, has been negotiating with Harvard approximately every two weeks since October 2018 after forming nearly a year ago.
The union represents all undergraduate students employed by the University who hold instructional roles, meaning terms of the contract currently being negotiated between HGSU-UAW and Harvard will impact them. There is one undergraduate member on the 13-person HGSU-UAW bargaining committee.
Some undergraduate teaching staff, however, said they were unaware that they are included in the union’s bargaining unit and expected to pay union dues once the contract is ratified.
Ryan S. Jiang ’20, a teaching fellow for Computer Science 181: “Machine Learning,” said he could not recall interacting with the union, nor was he aware that undergraduate student workers would be covered under the contract once it is finalized.
“If there was, like, an opportunity to learn more about what they are doing and stuff like that, I would definitely be willing to,” Jiang said.
A HGSU-UAW information session for undergraduate students in March was attended by fewer than five undergraduates.
Jessica L. Eng ’21, a teaching fellow for Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science” last semester, said she received emails from HGSU-UAW while working as a teaching fellow, but she “personally did not interact” with the union.
“I think right now, a lot of their efforts — from the language of the emails — were more graduate-focused,” said Eng, who is currently comping The Crimson’s Arts board.
Eng also said she participated in organizing efforts on behalf of the union prior to last year’s vote and before she herself became a student instructor. This effort, however, had nothing to do with her own personal — or expected — future membership in the union.
Evan C. MacKay ’19, the only undergraduate on HGSU-UAW’s committee that negotiates directly with Harvard, said that the “miscommunication” or “confusion” among undergraduate members who are unaware that they are part of union’s bargaining unit is “unfortunate.”
“It's really important to us that student workers would know that they are part of the unit and have more clarity on that,” he said. “That's one of the reasons why we put forth proposals that would have student workers actually receiving an appointment letter that would tell them that they are in the unit.”
Not all current undergraduate teaching staff receive an appointment letter upon acceptance to their instructional positions, according to MacKay. A proposal by HGSU-UAW would require such letters be provided to new hires, along with information about the union, he said.
“We’re hoping that in future semesters, when we have a secured contract, that problem will be avoided,” he said.
MacKay said the divide between undergraduate and graduate student workers is partly a result of the Harvard administration’s efforts to “divide the undergraduate and graduate community.”
He cited a University proposal in October that would have excluded student workers who “did not meet a certain cap, in hours per week” from the bargaining unit.
“They have consistently put forth proposals that treats undergraduate and graduate students differently in how benefits might apply to them,” MacKay said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard did propose a minimum average number of hours per week for student workers to be in the bargaining unit early in the negotiations. The union, however, rejected that proposal and the University withdrew it. The two sides reached a tentative agreement on union recognition in early November that includes all undergraduate teaching staff.
“The University has never disputed which classification of students would be included in this bargaining unit,” Swain wrote.

Students concentrating in a variety of fields gathered in Harvard Hall for the Economics Department’s first session of its four-part inaugural Personal Finance Workshop series on Monday evening.
Open to all undergraduate students, the free workshop comprises four weekly sessions throughout April, each covering practical financial topics — from understanding credit to investing to behavioral economics. Economics professors John Y. Campbell and Karen Dynan taught Monday’s session, and professors David I. Laibson and Jeffrey A. Miron will help lead subsequent classes.
Monday’s session on personal finance and the basics of credit drew roughly 125 attendees, which included both Economics concentrators and students concentrating in other fields. Dynan and Campbell both said they were especially pleased with the turnout and the enthusiasm demonstrated by students.
“We were delighted with the turnout last night and with the interest students were sharing. People were asking lots of questions, which was great,” Campbell said.
The Personal Finance Workshops aim to bring awareness to common financial issues in an effort to promote financial literacy among “a broader audience,” according to Campbell.
“This is a time when everyone in society is faced with ever more complex financial decisions,” he said. “Higher education gets more and more expensive. Many people acquire debt…and we feel that everybody can use some basic education in this material, so we hope to be useful in this.”
Miron said he wants to make it clear that the sessions are meant to be accessible to all students regardless of background.
“All undergraduates are welcome,” he said. “You absolutely do not need a background in economics… Almost everything we’re trying to get across is based on simple reasoning, simple logic to organize how you think about your own finances.”
The hope is that by teaching students about such topics, they will then apply this knowledge to their own financial lives, according to Dynan.
“Our view has been that if people understand the underlying reasons for these rules — as well as some of the relevant evidence — they can do a better job with their own finances,” Dynan wrote in an email.
Mark H. Kong ’21, who attended Monday’s session, said he found it informative and will likely attend future workshops as well.
“There’s enough content that something will end up being helpful that I may not have known about. For example, I had an incorrect assumption about mortgages so I learned about that,” he said. “I think there’s stuff here that’s definitely applicable.”
Organizers said the future of the workshop will depend on how the “trial-run” goes this month. The workshop’s evolution will rely upon student feedback.
“Depending on how that goes, how much attendance we have, how much interest we’ve heard about from other sources, we might do something similar next year, or we might want to repeat it at other times, or we might want to adjust the target audience or the material,” Miron said. “But we’re just kind of experimenting right now.”
Correction: April 7, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated 25 people attended Monday's workshop. In fact, 125 people attended the workshop.

Dean of Harvard Business School Nitin Nohria said one of the most significant challenges the school faces today is the erosion of faith in capitalism and business world at large in an interview Tuesday.
He said that since the Business School has always been so closely associated with broader trends in the business world, it must work toward reassuring society that businesses and the capitalist system are productive.
“We — as a school that has often been associated with business, which is closely associated with capitalism — need to ask, ‘what can we do to make sure that society's trust in capitalism remains strong and can be rebuilt,’” Nohria said.
He noted that the school has taken several actions in an effort to answer that question, including introducing more courses focused on ideas about economic structure.
“We are trying to find ways that we can engage our students in those kinds of conversations, all the way from having a second year course called ‘Reimagining Capitalism’ that has become one of our most successful second year electives, to now trying to bring that material back into the first year of our MBA curriculum,” he said.
The shift in public opinion on capitalism is especially pronounced among young Americans, according to a Gallup poll. Less than half of people in the 18 to 29-year-old age group had a positive view of capitalism in 2018. This marked a 12 percentage point decline in the past two years.
Nohria also said the school has recently undertaken made an effort to consider areas of research and “projects on the future world” that have previously been considered outside of the scope of a business school.
“[The Business School focuses on] research that relies on what can business do to address questions that historically people may have thought of as being in the public realm, whether it's healthcare, K through 12 education, workforce retraining,” he said.
The school has also begun directing its resources and research toward economically marginalized communities, according to Nohria. In particular, the school is focusing on bringing more economic opportunities across America.
“We're now trying to ask the question, ‘how do we more seriously get engaged with the American heartland and think harder about parts of America that feel left behind?' What we can do to bring more economic opportunity?” he said.
The University has made an increased effort in recent years to spread its message from Cambridge across the nation. University President Lawrence S. Bacow has personally engaged in this effort, visiting schools across the country in an effort to counter ideas that Harvard only serves the United State’s liberal elite.
Still, Nohria said the school’s largest area of concern at the moment remains addressing underlying distrust in the United States’ economic framework.
“It's really important for business to regain the trust of society,” he said. “Harvard Business School needs to more proactively think about how to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ron S. Suskind lectured on autism and identity at the Graduate School of Education Tuesday evening, sharing his experiences raising a son with autism and his efforts to develop a therapy app.
Suskind, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, was a senior national affairs reporter at the Wall Street Journal and has also contributed to the New York Times Magazine and Esquire. In 2014, Suskind authored “Life, Animated,” a memoir detailing his son Owen’s life with autism. The book was made into a documentary of the same name, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2016.
Suskind said Owen’s growing awareness of other people’s perception of him as he got older motivated Suskind to write the memoir.
“I think what triggered it was when our son Owen, who’s on the autism spectrum, was about nineteen, and he said to me and my wife Cornelia one night, ‘people don’t see me for who I am,’” Suskind said. “He was starting to become aware of the way people were looking at him.”
“We would have to write a book with the goal of changing the way people see people like our son,” he said.
In “Life, Animated,” Suskind writes about how Owen’s affinity for Disney films helped him develop the ability to speak after years of mutism. More recently, Suskind built a team of experts to design a communication app called Sidekicks for children with autism. The app uses YouTube clips concerning the child’s interests to improve their communication with parents and therapists.
“They can share the video in real time, but remotely, which is crucial,” Suskind said. “None of that energy and anxiety from mom. Kind of private, kind of not, kind of like we’re sitting at the couch looking at the TV, side by side.”
As part of the app development, Suskind partnered with the Project on Affinities and Language at MIT, where researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to scan brain activity of people on the autism spectrum while using the app.
“These are showing key areas of neural function, many of them not expected to activate in any way among spectrum populations,” he said referencing images from the research. “She is processing that language in a neurotypical fashion.”
“For a spectrum family, this is an orchestra and crescendo. It’s hope and joy,” he said of the findings associated with the app.
Miso Kwak, a student at the Graduate School of Education who attended the talk, said she was impressed by Suskind’s lecture and work.
“He’s thinking about autism through the lens of strength rather than deficit,” she said.

Harvard University Health Services is looking into piloting an app that would allow patients to diagnose their symptoms at home, HUHS Director Paul J. Barreira said in an interview Monday.
The app uses artificial intelligence to provide medical advice to users, according to Barreira. Other companies have already used the technology, and HUHS may pilot the app at the University, Barreira said.
The program would lead a patient through questions about their symptoms before offering treatment advice. The app would also collect data on its users, allowing providers to track diagnoses of their patients, according to Barreira.
“There’s a capacity for this to be incorporated into our medical record so we could see what happened,” Barreira said. “And then we could call the student the next day and say, ‘what’d you do with it?’”
Barreira said the app could improve efficiency and help HUHS better use its resources. By advising patients remotely, the technology could eliminate unnecessary doctor visits and cut down on wait times for appointments, allowing providers to reserve resources for those who need them most.
“It would cut down on emergency rooms,” Barreira said. “It would cut down on urgent care. Sometimes — particularly after hours — students just walk in just because it’s here. The question they ask could have been answered without being seen or could have been answered by a telephone operator.”
Though HUHS has not officially started plans for a pilot, Barreira suggested that the College could test the app in one of the undergraduate house neighborhoods: River East, River Central, River West, or the Quad.
Another location HUHS is considering for the pilot is Harvard Business School, as HUHS is in the process of closing their satellite clinic on its campus. Barreira said he thinks the Business School would be more readily accepting of the program.
“I think the Business School students are more likely to adopt it, because they’ve had more experience with self-care,” Barreira said. “They’re older. They’re across the river — that might as well be across the English Channel. It’s hard to get over here from the Business School. I could imagine them being more readily willing to adopt it.”
“We’re trying to think very creatively about what is the best way to connect with students,” he added.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences debated proposals to implement a new data requirement for the General Education program, establish a new biotechnology degree, and study course registration changes at its monthly meeting Tuesday.
The new Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement would replace the current Gen Ed requirement in Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, which students can fulfill using classes that cover statistics, probability, mathematics, logic, or decision theory.
To complete the proposed requirement, students must take a course “involving mathematical, statistical, and computational methods that will enable them to think critically about data,” Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh said at the meeting. Though Claybaugh declined to provide specific courses that would fulfill the requirement, she said courses that engage with data in any department could count, citing Economics, Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science as examples.
The proposal comes as the Faculty of Arts and Sciences transitions to a new General Education program slated to start in the fall after a 2015 committee found that the current system is “failing on a variety of fronts.”
Faculty members debated the underlying philosophy of the proposed requirement, with some arguing that it privileges classes focused on data analysis or applied science over classes that teach basic science or logical reasoning.
"I would like to argue for a broad, inclusive requirement in quantitative reasoning per se, that would include the data-driven courses the committee has identified, that would affirm the value of basic science, and that would leave Harvard nimble enough to adapt to changing issues in science and society,” Mathematics Department Chair Curtis T. McMullen said.
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs praised the proposal in response, saying he believes many undergraduates are “deficient” in data analysis skills — a problem he said he finds unacceptable, especially among students in the sciences.
“I have students that don’t have the capacity to fit data to a line,” Stubbs said.
The faculty also debated a proposal to establish a biotechnology master’s degree program that would be jointly overseen by the Business School and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Professor Mark Fishman, who co-sponsored the legislation, said just 15 years ago, virtually none of his students were interested in biotechnology, but in recent years, he believes a clear majority are considering such a career.
“It’s becoming a tremendous emphasis by the students,” he said. “As an institution, we should be training the leaders of these biotech companies.”
Though Fishman said the proposed degree program would incorporate an ethical component, Medical Anthropology Professor Arthur Kleinman asked for further assurances that the “unintended consequences” of medicine would be highlighted in the curriculum.
“I want to be sure that in an undertaking like this, we give students the broadest possible understanding of their work for society in general,” he said.
The Faculty also debated legislation that would establish a new committee to explore methods to better predict course enrollment and coordinate class lotteries. The committee would have until spring 2022 to decide whether eliminating shopping week — the week-long period at the beginning of each semester during which students can explore courses before enrolling — is the only way to fix problems that plague the current system.
Some faculty members at Tuesday’s meeting said the hesitancy to eliminate shopping week sidestepped what they saw as its serious flaws, including a lack of instruction during the first week, uncertainty for graduate students, and some students’ tendency to use the time to seek out light-workload classes.
“Shopping week is shaped not only by students’ curiosity but… also other factors that we would do well to curtail,” Professor of German Art and Culture Jeffrey F. Hamburger said. “There are students who use it cynically to find the path of least resistance.”
Before the Faculty discussed the three pieces of legislation, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 updated the Faculty on Harvard’s negotiations with its student union. He said the committee has spent more than 60 hours at the bargaining table with Harvard Graduate Students Union — United Automobile Workers, but he noted the two sides “are not near to an end just yet,” urging patience during the months-long negotiation process.
Faculty will vote on the biotechnology degree, Quantitative Reasoning with Data requirement, and course registration proposals at its next meeting in May.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences called on University President Lawrence S. Bacow to lead a Faculty discussion on Harvard’s fossil fuel investments, citing “widespread, deep, and reasonable disagreement” with Bacow’s response to the issue.
Philosophy Professor Edward J. Hall raised the issue on behalf of nine professors during the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday. The group asked Bacow to host an open forum or dedicate a portion of a Faculty meeting to the issue, and to include members of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — in the discussion.
“We are not in the first instance a mere corporation, where all substantive decisions are taken by managers,” Hall said. “We are a college, committed to open intellectual debate even on issues that might directly affect our own future.”
“It would, in our view, be ethically and intellectually irresponsible not to let Harvard’s response to this crisis be guided by serious and sustained community-wide discussion,” he added.
Bacow responded that he would be “happy” to fulfill the professors’ request and would see if he could include a member of the Corporation in the discussions. He did not commit to any changes in investment decisions.
The Faculty members’ demand comes amid renewed student-led calls for Bacow and the University’s investment arm, the Harvard Management Company, to withdraw controversial investments, including those in the fossil fuel industry and in companies tied to prisons. In recent months, students have delivered multiple petitions to Massachusetts Hall regarding divestment.
Faculty members across the University most recently organized around the issue in December when the group Harvard Faculty for Divestment issued an open letter to Bacow arguing that the fossil fuel industry’s aims are “discordant with our mission and with the purposes of the endowment.” Since the letter’s publication on Dec. 11, more than 230 faculty have signed on to the statement.
Faculty members have argued for divestment in the past with some success. In the 1980s, professors spoke out against Harvard’s investment in firms that conducted business with the apartheid government in South Africa. The University eventually divested from some of the firms.
Bacow has repeatedly spoken out against divestment, citing a variety of explanations for why he believes divestment would be misguided, including “practical issues” associated with divestment and the importance of research and scholarship when addressing ethical concerns.
Hall said he and the other faculty decided to ask for such a meeting in part because of “widespread, deep, and reasonable disagreement” with Bacow’s stance across the University.
“Maybe those reasons are right, maybe not,” Hall said. “That does not matter to the question we are posing.”
A report released by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018 warned that without significant action, the world will face the calamitous effects of climate change by 2040, including more severe wildfires and food shortages. University leaders have set a goal of becoming fossil-fuel neutral by 2026 and completely fossil-fuel free by 2050, building on Harvard’s previous emissions reduction of 30 percent between 2006 and 2016.
In May 2018, a member of one of Harvard’s governing bodies took a stance against fossil fuel investment for the first time. Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80, a former member of the University’s Board of Overseers, resigned over what she called the University’s failure to “adopt ethical commitments” in its investments, citing fossil fuels specifically.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists, performers, and speakers at Harvard’s inaugural gender equity summit — Harvard Hears You — crossed the stage in the Smith Campus Center on Tuesday as onlookers passed through, staying for minutes or hours at the day-long event.
The event — co-hosted by the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and the Title IX Office — centered on issues of gender equity and inclusion across different industries and aspects of daily life. The day concluded with an evening panel featuring Emmy-nominated transgender actress Laverne Cox, design consultant and fashion influencer Nicolette Mason, fashion designer Christian Siriano, and Talk to Jess C.E.O. Jess Weiner.
The summit began Tuesday morning with opening remarks from Undergraduate Council President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 and Vice President Julia M. Huesa ’20, followed by a speech from University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
Bacow’s remarks were interrupted by a protest from the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, whose members dropped a banner behind Bacow’s head reading “Harvard Profits from Womxn’s Imprisonment” and held up signs from the crowd.
Zoë L. Hopkins ’22, who helped plan the protest, said Bacow did not respond to the banner in his speech.
“Prisoners broadly are sort of denied a basic standard of hygiene, but this becomes particularly harsh with women, in terms of feminine and menstrual care, reproductive healthcare, et cetera,” Hopkins said, explaining the issues the group hoped to highlight.
The group has repeatedly lobbied Bacow in recent months to divest the University’s nearly $40 billion endowment from companies associated with the United States prison system. Bacow has consistently declined to acquiesce to their demands.
University spokesperson Jonathan Swain declined to comment on the protest.
Following the introductory remarks, more than 100 people attended an opening keynote featuring consultant Jess Weiner, who helped launch Dove’s Real Beauty campaign and Mattel’s more inclusive additions to its Barbie line.
Weiner spoke about her experiences advocating against sexual harassment on campus when she was a college student, as well as the work she did with larger companies to help make more inclusive culture shifts.
“We have got to focus on being leaders instead of just being liked,” Weiner said. “We have to leverage our privilege to amplify those voices that are not heard, and to know when to shut up and listen to people who need to be heard.”
Some summit events also focused on the Student Survey on Sexual Assault & Misconduct, which was released Tuesday. The survey, administered to all students across the University, comes four years after Harvard’s first offered a survey on sexual misconduct climate.
During a panel entitled “How Data and Student Voices Drive Change,” University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill discussed how Harvard has adapted this year’s iteration to better include graduate students.
Student performers including spoken word poet Najya A. Williams ’20 and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College also participated in the day's activities.
“We spend a lot of time thinking about how we should incentivize people to do this work,” Williams said. “There should never be a reason why we need to incentivize anyone to do this work. Because guess what? It’s work that involves all of us.”
Kacey E. Gill ’20, president of the Association of Black Harvard Women, spoke on a panel about the voices that often go unheard during conversations about gender equity.
“People who are going to come to this conference and the summit are certain types of people,” she said. “There’s also a lot of people who are not here, and there needs to be conversations that include those people who chose not to be here for whatever reason.”
Capping off the day’s back-to-back programming was a celebrity panel later in the evening focused on dynamics of gender, power, and inclusion.
Cox, who is the first transgender woman of color to land a starring role on a mainstream scripted television series, reflected on advice she’d accumulated throughout her career. She said she has learned that the phrase “what gets in the way becomes the way” rings true.
“For so many years, I thought the trans thing was keeping me from a career. And that was part of it, let’s be real. But in retrospect, I wasn’t ready for any of this a moment before it happened,” she said.
Siriano, who won Project Runway and is known for advocating for size inclusivity and diversity in fashion, said he believes there is more to fashion than just producing beautiful clothing.
“I’d more want to be recognized as doing something great. Not like, ‘Oh, he made great clothes,’ but that I made people feel good. I think that’s more interesting,” Siriano said of what motivates his work.
Mason noted learning about one’s biases takes self-awareness, and that working to create an environment where people feel comfortable enough to reflect on and learn more about those biases is important.
“Nobody likes to think of themselves as getting these things wrong, but we all do,” she said.

To say the least, the Harvard dating scene is not your average college dating scene. It sometimes seems impossible to just “catch a meal” with someone, and if you want to hear about dating woes straight from the mouths of students, just take a look at Harvard Confessions. With formals season coming up, however, many are on the lookout for a date. How do you know if they’re the one for you or if you’re better off just committing to your pset for now?
The Good…
If your date drops one of these, it’s safe to say you’ve found a keeper.
“I was featured in the Adams Housing Day video...”
Can we say starstruck? Adams’ video was top quality, so we’re betting your date must be too. Bonus points if they’ll perform a verse for you.
“Don’t worry, I cleared a day in my G-Cal for you!”
Wow, we can hear the wedding bells chiming already. If you can earn a few blocks in your sweetheart’s agenda, you know you’re a top priority.
The Bad…
Uh oh, major red flag alert! If you hear one of these, it may be time to jump ship.
“Oh my gosh! I recognize you from that party at the Igloo!”
Ouch. We love the Quad and its wholesome community, but some nights are best left forgotten. Maybe you can form a better connection when the sun’s out and your feet aren’t planted on sticky floor?
“I’m out of BoardPlus. Can you cover me?”
Really? A date on Harvard’s dime is always ideal, but mooching off your date is not the move. If you’re feeling forgiving, let it slide — but hopefully they offer to pick up the next date (if there is one).
The Ugly…
As soon as your date says one of these lines, make a speedy getaway. Things can only go downhill from here.
“Can I check if my AirPods charger works?”
TIME TO RUN. TROUBLE IS AFOOT.
“Yeah, and the most transformative thing about my McKinsey internship last summer was…”
We’re pretty sure no other college on the face of the planet has to deal with the whole is-this-a-date-or-do-they-just-want-me-to-endorse-them-on-LinkedIn issue. If resumes seem to be the only topic of conversation with your date, it might actually be an interview.
For those of you still in search of love post-Datamatch, be on the lookout for these key phrases on your next ~romantic~ encounter. Best of luck snagging a special someone to drag to the endless stream of formals coming up!
