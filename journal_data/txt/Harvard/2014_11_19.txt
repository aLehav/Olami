“A composition is a proposition of what a music could be,” says Michael Pisaro, the current Fromm Visiting Professor in Composition, who performed his composition “Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation” on Nov. 13 in Paine Hall with three other musicians. Fromm’s hour-long piece was far from the most accessible “proposition” to grace the stage of Paine Hall, but it revolved around a complex yet fascinating structure that proved to be totally engrossing.
“Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation” consists of 13 “rings” of sound focused about a central core. The rings themselves draw from a wide variety of sounds, including sine tones, a piano, percussion, and found objects, all presented in a periodic manner. Pisaro visualizes the piece’s structure as a growing, downwards spiral as each ring is introduced and developed, starting with the innermost ring. As time elapses, the music “thickens,” as Pisaro puts it, and develops into an enveloping, engaging atmosphere of sound.
According to Pisaro, “Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation” walks the line of two boundaries: first, between order and indeterminacy and second, between music and noise. These two principles are woven into the piece’s structure itself. The piece, on one hand, is very deterministic. Its core is a sequence of 88 sine tones based on the overtone series of 29Hz, each played for exactly 40 seconds; thus, the piece must last exactly 58 minutes and 40 seconds. Every sound in the rings is marked with a time—down to fractions of a second—for when it is to be played. On the other hand, some sounds are to be pre-selected uniquely for each performance, and one musician is even instructed to play live sounds from a radio.
The organization of the rings also plays a part in the relationship between music and noise. The inner rings are unequivocally musical—sine tones and piano notes. The middle rings are unpitched percussion instruments that are less obviously harmonic. Rings nearer the edge are perhaps included in an extended definition of music—in the Nov. 13 performance, one such ring contained the clicking of a damaged CD player. Finally, the outermost rings would generally not be considered music, as they contain white noise, radio static, and recordings of ocean waves. The piece, then, resembles a gradient where the music is most concentrated at the core and becomes more abstract at the edges.
The piece’s extraordinary complexities stem from a simple idea. Pisaro conceived of the rings when considering the original ensemble for which he was writing “Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation”—a Chicago-based musical ensemble called “Haptic.” “We had a music in which people are playing a bunch of different devices,” Pisaro said. “And that’s when I started to formulate the idea of the rings.”
Despite Pisaro’s extremely modern compositional style, he still maintains a traditional outlook on the purpose and function of music in human culture. “There’s no question in my mind that contemporary music has a spiritual function—not necessarily a religious one—but in some sense, the music is still doing what it did a thousand years ago,” Pisaro said. And “Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation,” cerebral as it seems when dissected into rings and overtone series, is ultimately very spiritual.

Quote: “They say that the best blaze burns brightest when circumstances are at their worst.” —Young Sophie in “Howl’s Moving Castle” (2004). Since Hayao Miyazaki announced his retirement last year, many fans of his beloved films have been in withdrawal, saddened at the thought of never seeing another Miyazaki masterpiece. But there may be hope yet!
The Story: Although Miyazaki announced his departure from Studio Ghibli last year, the legendary animator and director stated during an interview with The Los Angeles Times on Nov. 7 that he will continue to create new manga and is very busy despite his retirement from feature-length filmmaking. This statement came after it was announced that he would receive an Honorary Academy Award at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Governors Awards. This is his second Oscar, following his first for his 2001 film “Spirited Away.”
What to say to that one guy who lives to bash movie adaptations…
Are TV adaptations any better? We’ll see soon! Popular book series “A Series of Unfortunate Events” was first adapted into a movie in 2004. While it was critically well-received, some loyal fans (or maybe just this loyal fan) thought the adaptation could have been better, perhaps by utilizing the extended format of a TV series. Netflix certainly thought so and recently announced that they will be adapting the 13-book saga into an original series. In the wake of other successes among Netflix original series—“House of Cards,” “Orange Is the New Black,” and their reboot of “Arrested Development” (disappointing though it was)—dare we hope that “A Series of Unfortunate Events” will be reborn and transport us back to the days of our childhood?
What to say when you’re invited to watch yet another Nicholas Sparks movie… 
Put down your worn-out copy of “The Notebook” and pick up something infinitely better. After being dropped by Sony and battling its way through Hollywood for four years, “Beyond the Lights” has finally been released, premiering in theaters Nov. 14. This romantic film—which follows a female hip-hop star’s battles with fame, family, and her sense of self—was written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, whose previous successes include “Love & Basketball” and “The Secret Life of Bees.” Although a handful of critics have given Prince-Bythewood’s newest release negative reviews, the film has generally been a success, due in part to the impressive performances from Minnie Driver and Gugu Mbatha-Raw.
What to say to your date who loves sci-fi… 
Have you seen “Interstellar”? Christopher Nolan’s new film opened in theatres on Nov.7, and so far the reception has been predominantly positive. This film seems to reaffirm that Nolan still has a golden touch for storytelling, joining his long line of successes, including “Inception” and “The Dark Knight” trilogy (in case you live under a rock and need reminding). However, in the scientific community there has been both positive and negative feedback on how the film handles portraying complicated scientific theories.
What to say to your friend who was a bona fide nerd in high school… 
The makers of “The Hobbit” released the official trailer for the last installment of the trilogy! “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” is set to premiere in theaters on Dec. 17. Considering the reception of the first two “Hobbit” films was mostly positive, it’s safe to hope that this film will not disappoint. After watching this final chapter, you may want to go ahead and set aside a day to binge watch the “Lord of the Rings Trilogy.” You’ll finally have all of the pieces needed to watch the story on its full linear timeline à la Star Wars.
What to say to your roommate who can’t even decide which top to wear… 
At least you’re not Taylor Swift. After publishing her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal detailing her views on the future of the music industry, Swift decided to put her money where her mouth was by pulling her music from the popular music streaming site Spotify. Swift has stuck by her statement, despite some major backlash from fans. This bold move calls to mind some of the other strong stances that the singer has taken recently, including the stance she took on sexism on Australian podcast “Jules, Merrick & Sophie.” Echoing her response from a 2013 interview with Vanity Fair, Swift claimed that the way the media treats her writing about past and present relationships is sexist, pointing out that artists like Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran are never asked why they write about their exes and girlfriends. Perhaps that is why she has decided to embrace the media’s image of her and play with it, as seen in her new music video for “Blank Space.”

After my last piece on the changing pop music scene, I couldn’t help but feel like I was coming off as a bit jaded and perhaps a bit too much like an angry grandparent cursing the current music idols of America’s youth. So, in this final installment, I thought I would inject a bit of optimism back into my conversation about current music and the direction in which music production and consumption are headed:
1. Singles, and the artists who focus on them, are not all bad: turns out T-Swift and Meghan Trainor don’t have it that easy, as artists work hard to produce songs that get stuck in the world’s ear. But while many manage to gain widespread popularity, there are some who still work to integrate intricate chord progressions with hummable melodies (Clean Bandit), showcase killer vocal ranges (Bruno Mars, Sia), or bring innovative sounds to pop (Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams).
2. Albums, in one form or another, are probably here to stay: it’s important to acknowledge that there is a significant population of hipsters browsing records in the back of Urban Outfitters who think there really is nothing like purchasing an album. As a result, many independent artists have continued focusing on this art form regardless of industry-driving trends. An admittedly ridiculous study correlating music trends and SAT scores from 2009 tells us that many of these album-producing indie/alternative artists—Sufjan Stevens, The Shins, and Radiohead—fall on the higher end of the intelligence spectrum, whereas Lil Wayne, Beyoncé, and The Used are lumped into the “music for dumb people” category. This study is far from scientific, using Facebook as a main source, so I won’t argue that indie albums are superior to other music forms out there (for the record, I’m equal parts Sufjan and Bey fan), but people are still listening to artists who are producing quality albums, even if they lie below the surface of Hot 100.
3. Popular artists today are doing some pretty cool things: that statement might sound general, but it only takes looking back to ’80s dance music or ’90s grunge to see that today’s pop is more diverse than ever in terms of style and form. Beyoncé may or may not be the most gifted pop star out there, but her self-titled, 2013 audio-visual album was a modern music marvel, taking the music video form to an epic new level. New technologies might have their drawbacks in terms of the future of conventional albums, but they have the benefit of pushing artists to create bigger and better ways of presenting their music to audiences. Based on the innovations of the past decade, the future definitely looks bright.
Now, this lofty stuff is great, but I want to leave you a couple tips about moving forward—zooming back in, if you will—not just on how to appreciate albums but also on how to approach music in general.
1. Look deeper than the chart-toppers: In the past few weeks, I’ve tried to use a wide variety of examples from different styles, genres, and eras to talk about albums in the hope of showing that there is good music out there for any set of ears. It also shows that limiting music consumption to downloading the top few songs of the week on iTunes limits our access to the amazing depth of new music available today. Listen to friends’ recommendations, use Spotify suggestions or Songza to your advantage and discover new music. But when you find something you like, remember that it might be worth splurging on the complete album.
2. Listen. Really Listen: This one might sound counter-intuitive, but I strongly believe that if we want to look critically at how music consumption is evolving, we need to step back from our current sense of musical normalcy. The first step is making music less of a background activity and more of an active one. If you care about albums as an art form the way I do, it might be wise to find a friend, grab a drink, and take the time to listen to an album from start to finish. You’ll probably hear things—a killer track hidden on the B-side, a natural ebb and flow, a story or theme—you’ve never heard before.
I hope this last piece is less of an endpoint and more of a springboard to exploring music in a new way. Maybe I’ve turned you onto albums and off of “All About That Bass,” or maybe not.  Regardless, Shakespeare had it right when he wrote, “If music be the food of love, play on.” Let the music play.

“Bat Boy: The Musical” isn’t stuffed with laugh-out-loud moments, but it’s performed with remarkable gusto. The very idea of a half-human, half-bat creature—as well as some later, even more farfetched plot points—are all taken in stride by the protagonists, leading to delightfully bizarre tableaux that keep the audience amused and engaged throughout, if not exactly doubled over with laughter. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Bat Boy,” which runs until Nov. 23, wins points for consistency, wittiness, and overall polish. With a sophisticated, clever set and costume design, and self-aware actors who toe the line between the campy and the commonplace, “Bat Boy” takes a vivacious relish in the overall absurdity that permeates the production.
“Bat Boy” begins as a trio of teenage would-be-spelunkers stumble upon a feral, humanoid creature in the caves surrounding the small, insular town of Hope Falls. The creature, referred to as the Bat Boy (Jacob D. Rienstra ’17) is ultimately entrusted to the care of Dr. Parker (Jake Ohlbaum), the local veterinarian, where he is taught the basics of civility and christened with a new name—Edgar. Edgar becomes a de facto part of the Parker household but must overcome his feral instincts, the mistrust of the townspeople, and Dr. Parker’s growing resentment before he can truly be accepted.
Keythe Farley and Brian Flemming, the original writers of the “Bat Boy” book and musical, as will as songwriter and lyricist Laurence C. O’Keefe ’91 collaborated with director Ally M. Kiley ’15 and musical director Cynthia S. Meng ’15 to develop new scenes and songs for the musical, though the major strokes of the plot and the overall tone of the production are carried over from the original off-Broadway production.
The acting is of high quality throughout. Rienstra’s Bat Boy is wonderfully adaptable, transitioning flawlessly from a Gollum-like, scuttling creature to an eloquent, dapper young man-bat. His depiction of Edgar has, at all its stages, a certain fragility—a certain naked genius to it that makes Edgar unusually sympathetic. You want to love Rienstra’s Bat Boy because you feel the difficulty behind the transformation, the vulnerability inherent in Edgar’s re-entry into a fundamentally alien world. When a newly civilized Bat Boy, for instance, lapses back into his bestial frame of mind and attacks Dr. Parker, Rienstra’s Bat Boy, upon realizing what he has done, reacts with such poignant, shattered horror that it’s impossible not to feel sorry for him. Rienstra is also incredibly expressive, in both his movements (the intro has him nimbly swinging around some scaffolding, even hanging, bat-like, upside-down at certain points) and his voice, managing to imbue Edgar’s pre-speech clicks and squeals with a remarkably human range of expression.
Meredith Parker, played by Taylor K. Phillips ’15 is excellent as the matronly Mrs. Parker, showing a real, tender affection for Edgar, along with an underlying grit in her dealings with Dr. Parker himself. Tess V. Davison ’16, portraying the Parkers’ teenage daughter Shelley, shows off a slightly parodic teenage naïveté. The supporting cast, most of whom played two or three different roles of varying genders, were all incredibly solid, and their lines grabbed a high percentage of audience laughs. Dylan J. Peterson ’17  and Kyle R. Whelihan ’17, in drag as Lorraine and Mrs. Taylor respectively, performed their roles with relish, lapsing into hilariously overblown falsettos when particularly agitated.
Dr. Parker, on the other hand, is treated to a much more reserved portrayal by Jake Ohlbaum, who initially shows the veterinarian as a tired, belabored, thinly stretched figure. But Ohlbaum successfully depicts Parker’s slow slide into insanity until even his seemingly realistic character begins to take on the slightly absurd, larger-than-life verve which characterizes the atmosphere of the production.
Meng’s score and Tomi J. Adeyemi ‘15 choreography also carry this bombastic verve with arrangements ranging from booming, quasi-choral arrangements, sung faux-somberly by black-robed Bat Boy Adherents, to rollicking, pop-rocky numbers, all performed with gusto by a live pit orchestra under Meng’s direction and adding yet another layer of campy relish to the production. The “Hold Me Bat Boy, Touch Me Bat Boy” refrain, in particular, is sung with extreme glee by the entire cast.
The lighting and set design of “Bat Boy” are unfailingly clever and well executed, providing a remarkably clean yet slightly tongue-in-cheek backdrop against which the bizarre events of the play can unfold. The Parkers’ kitchen/living room is rendered in warm light, with cream-and-mint pastels that give the space a certain banal domesticity—which makes it all the funnier when the Bat Boy scampers about their home, hopping up and down on their quaint, mint-colored backless chaise. And the play’s execution of the notoriously difficult flashbacks is extremely clever and intuitive. Two supporting characters, only their silhouettes visible from behind a backlit screen, act out the event in question as the two reminiscing characters stand spotlighted at each end of a darkened stage, as they narrate the action depicted unfolding behind the screen.
The costume design is clever as well—packets of fake blood are cunningly hidden on the characters, and in the play’s occasional moments of violence, streams of fake blood gleefully spurt all over the stage and characters. The effect is especially pronounced with Edgar, who is clad in white for the majority of the play; the blood splatters and stains his dapper white ensemble as the play progresses, an ingenious reminder of the struggle between savagery and civility that dominates his character. But the fake blood is also just fun, and every time it appears the entire ensemble greets it with an overblown, horrified-yet-delighted gasp.
Harvard’s production of “Bat Boy” is performed with admirable gusto and satisfaction, with a high degree of wittiness and polish. It’s an overblown, rollicking production, but one that’s self-aware and clever throughout.

Anton Chekhov’s play “Three Sisters” emerged in a nouveau-siècle Russia that had recently shed the shackles of feudalism to take its first steps into the world of modernity. The play revolves around Moscow, the city of hope and progress that reaches a Arcadia-like status for siblings Olga (Rachel A. Orol ’15), Masha (Rachel A. Gibian ’15), Irina (Chase Sui Wonders ’18) and Andrei (Matthew S. Krane ’15) Prozorov ever since they left it 11 years ago, when their late father, a military officer, was transferred to the provincial garrison town that becomes the play’s setting. Very conscious of their superior status and education, the three sisters and their brother wallow in an ennui only made bearable by the visits of officers from nearby artillery posts, whose presence catalyzes love affairs and deadly duels that shatter the Prozorovs’ dream of returning to Moscow.
This yearning for modernity and progress was made front and center in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Three Sisters,” which ran from Nov. 7 to Nov. 15 on the Loeb Mainstage. The production infused the play with a 21st-century flavor, and its subtle wit engaged the modern audience while fully preserving the poignancy of the characters’ conditions. The play effectively made up for the lackluster performances of some of its lead actors through an ingenious use of props and stage design, which helped to deliver the emotional power that the blocking and acting largely failed to convey.
The general flatness of the acting was most apparent in active Crimson Arts Editor Caleb M. Lewis ’17’s rendering of Tuzenbach, a young lieutenant who is in love with Irina. The Chekhov character is a serious-minded man: he often ponders whether happiness is attainable or an unreachable thing of the future, and his love for Irina causes him to quit the army to go into manual labour that (in his eyes) would make him worthy of her. However, Lewis played him with an incongruous levity, speaking in rapid outbursts and often swallowing the last words of his lines. It was difficult to tell the amorous Tuzenbach from the desperate or philosophizing one, since all were played with the same automaton alacrity. It was difficult to believe that such a nonchalantly played character died for his principles and love for Irina at the end of the play.
More tragic still was that his dear lover wasn’t worth fighting for. Indeed, perhaps the nail in the play’s coffin was the performance of the lead actress, Wonders. While Irina’s two older sisters have pragmatic reasons for their dissatisfaction with the provincial setting—Olga is exhausted from an unfulfilling post at the local elementary school, and Masha suffers from manic depression due to a early marriage with one of the school’s teachers—Irina is in a more elusive state of melancholy that stems from her adolescent ambitions of finding love and prestige in Moscow. Wonders failed to address this subtlety of emotion, reducing Irina’s contemplative hopefulness and melancholy to black-and-white fits of frolicking happiness or melodramatic sadness. For instance, when the economic failings of Irina’s brother Andrei force the siblings to mortgage the house and ultimately forfeit their dreams of leaving the town, Wonders portrays the character’s laments with hysterical gestures and loud sobs that reduced Irina’s aching despair to a child’s tantrum.
Wonders’s lack of depth, however, was assuaged by the play’s innovative incorporation of a modern film camera, which director Anna A. Hagen ’15 used to replace the original spinning top given to Irina for her 20th birthday. Hagen transformed this prop into an integral part of the set design and perhaps the most winning feature of the production. During the first act, the camera was a gift given to Irina by the aging army doctor and family friend Chebutykin (Alex G. Smith ’17). In an admirable feat of technological seamlessness, however—the audience never saw how or when this was done, though this undoubtedly hints at the crew’s efficient use of scene changes—the camera was linked to a projector that hung above the set. The entire device was then turned on by several of the characters during their monologues to focus and magnify the actor’s face. It is during these moments that Wonders was able to better embody the poignancy of Irina’s melancholy, responding to the new intimacy that the camera afforded with a more nuanced performance. During these confessional monologues, Wonders shed her theatrical gesticulations to instead charge her words with genuine emotional weight. Thanks to this physical close-up of Irina’s face, the audience was able to see Chekhov’s carefully crafted words come alive without the distraction of Wonders’s inadequate blocking.
The camera’s fragmentary effect was most memorable when Andrei lamented the humiliating prospect of setting aside his dreams of becoming a professor to instead take the job of an office clerk. As he exclaimed (to his fate), “What do you want? What do you want?” Krane leaned so close to the screen that all that was seen was the single powerful magnified image of his eye, which stared at the audience from the large screen overhead. This focus on Andrei’s eye effectively conveyed the pathos of the scene as it brought the audience to a confrontation with the ultimate window into the human consciousness—an enterprise that rightly resonates with the Chekhovian œuvre.
The freshness of the production’s contemporary mise-en-scène, however, was due in part to its faithful retention of some of Chekhov more timeless gems. It was ultimately this respect for Chekhov’s vision, which—coupled with the clever set design—more than compensated for the actors’ subpar performances. The final image of Act III was of the three sisters embracing as they accept the disintegration of their initial aspirations. As the lights turned back on, the audience was left with the “Waltz for Dewayne Pomeroy,”  the lilting notes of which are without doubt just as soulful and haunting as they had been for Chekhov premiere a century ago.

“I needed to tell a story,” said Marianne Moore biographer Linda Leavell during her talk in the Houghton Library’s Edison Newman Room on Nov. 13. “Not just that Marianne Moore is an important poet. [Sue Grafton] said, ‘This is Marianne Moore’s life, but it’s your story. So what’s your story about Marianne Moore?’”
Leavell, a Beinecke Fellow at Yale University known for her biographical works “Marianne Moore and the Visual Arts: Prismatic Color” (1995) and “Holding On Upside Down: The Life and Work of Marianne Moore” (2013), spoke extensively about Moore’s development as a writer, emphasizing the effect of Moore’s family on her writing. The talk paralleled a visit made by Moore herself to Harvard in 1954, during which she gave a poetry reading, was served beer and pretzels, and dined with a cousin of T.S. Eliot at the Faculty Club.
“Marianne Moore became the important poet she was because of her resistance and her survival of her very oppressive mother,” Leavell said. “What I needed to do in this book was to tell the story of Moore’s family.”
Leavell’s detailed research showed in her numerous anecdotes throughout the talk. She described the Moore family dynamic in great detail and highlighted its importance in shaping Moore’s poetry. “After they read ‘The Wind in the Willows,’ [Marianne and her brother Warner] adopted those names,” Leavell said. “Marianne was ‘Rat’ or ‘Ratty,’ the scribbler of verses. Warner was Badger, and [their mother] Mary was Mole, the home-loving mole. I found this so captivating.... But as I read, I thought—there’s something a little eerie about this. The creepy thing was that Mary Moore wanted her children to stay children. She didn’t want them to grow up. She imagined them all living together for the rest of her life.”
Leavell said that this cloistering of the Moore children had an oppressive impact. However, the siblings dealt with it in different ways: while Warner decided to pack up and leave the family, Moore’s only sanctuary was her poetry.
“After writing my first draft, I felt that I knew Mary Moore and Warner Moore,” Leavell said. “But I still didn’t really feel like I knew my main character because she didn’t talk about her life and her feelings as much as the other two did. So then I turned to her poetry. And that’s where I think her emotion lies. That was her outlet.”
In response to the historical criticism that Moore’s poetry is “unfeminine” and “cerebral,” Leavell quoted Moore’s poem “Silence”: “The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; / not in silence, but in restraint.”
Leavell was received well by the audience—her anecdotes were often met with chuckles and grins by the attending group of writers, poets, and a few college students.
The significance of woman writers and biographers was also heavily discussed. During the talk’s question-and-answer session, New England Conservatory Poet-In-Residence Ruth Lepson said, “It’s gratifying to hear a woman introduce a woman introduce a woman writing about a woman.” referring to the introductory remarks made by Woodberry Poetry Room Curator Christina Davis and Widener Research Librarian Odile Harter, as well as Linda Leavell’s talk on Marianne Moore.
Notably, the Poetry Room shared a rare recording of a “bad poetry reading” by Moore, in which Moore’s light self-deprecation can be heard at the recording’s end. This disconnect between Moore’s confident voice in her poems and her often shy mannerisms resonated with the audience.
“It’s a complicated relationship in the sense that [Moore] is an esteemed poet but deeply anxious about [appearing publicly] and coming to Harvard,” said Bonnie Costello, a professor at Boston University who has written on Moore. “She had a presence in her poetry that had a certain kind of deliberateness and directness about it…. It’s a very assertive poetry…. So you wouldn’t necessarily expect her to be in terror of the event or unsure of herself.”
The talk covered Moore’s gradual development and shift from a sheltered, anxious young woman to one who became more whimsical and confident in herself. “I think she realized that she suffered and she missed something by her loyalty to her mother,” Leavell said. “That it cramped her life. But when she did [make public appearances], she felt liberated, I think. And as she grew older she developed charisma—vulnerability and strength and proficiency and innocence, and audiences loved her.”

“’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore,” David Bowie’s newly released single off the upcoming retrospective “Nothing Has Changed,” blends classic rock music and modernism with flair typical of the iconic art rocker. Built on a skeleton of anxious synth beats and irregular, high-pitched piano notes, the song emerges as a weirdly compelling jumble of sound: it isn’t catchy, but it attracts in its strange patterns and contrasts. Bowie’s vocals, too, add an element of interest. Soft, emotional, and muted, heard as if through a wall, they follow a surprisingly simple melody quite at odds with the surrounding instrumental cacophony.
The point of it all, according to Bowie, has to do with abstract painting and World War I. “If Vorticists wrote Rock Music, it might have sounded like this,” he explains on his Facebook page. The Vorticists practiced in 20th-century Britain, working in bold color, quasi-cubist shapes, and semi-representational forms. It’s an odd comparison to make, but it’s also an apt one: “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” does seem explosive, straddling the line between the direct and abstract.
The lyrics in particular evince this balancing act. “’Tis a pity she was a whore / ’tis my curse, I suppose,” Bowie sings. “That was patrol / that was patrol / this is the war.” The words, while spoken in familiar phrases, describe a somewhat metaphorical situation.
A hint for how to interpret them might lie in another of Bowie’s remarks about the track. “The song acknowledges the shocking rawness of the First World War,” Bowie writes on Facebook. Indeed, gunshots can be heard in the first part of the song, along with a beat that seems like a marching rhythm.
“’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” has some high intellectual aims, and though it certainly won’t end up stuck in anyone’s head anytime soon, Bowie enthusiasts will have a good time trying to unravel its mysteries.
“Nothing Has Changed,” David Bowie’s latest compilation album, came out Nov. 17 via Parlophone.

It’s difficult to determine just what Ariel Pink’s new album “pom pom” is supposed to be. It’s only his third album with a major label, though he started self-producing material in the ’90s. In some ways, Pink has cleaned up his sound since departing from the lo-fi production that he had adopted out of necessity in the first part of his career. And yet, “clean” would be far from accurate as a descriptor of his music. “pom pom” is a mess of a record—it is heavily nostalgic, and yet it seems to have merely a tentative relationship with its source material. It’s pop music making fun of pop music. Still, it would be a mistake to dismiss the record entirely as a self-indulgent inside joke. There are stretches of “pom pom” that are honest and quite beautiful. But Pink layers on so much irony that it is hard to know what to take seriously.
The album opens with fun house jingle “Plastic Raincoats in the Pig Parade.” Like much of “pom pom,” the lyrics do not make a whole lot of sense, and the production sounds confused. The song shifts without warning between dream and nightmare. Clean, catchy bridges are demolished by bouts of discordant noise. Despite this chaos, the song almost works; harmony emerges from the disparate elements. But as if Pink is trying to be sure the song is unlistenable, the track devolves into pure noise and cacophony for its last 45 seconds.
It’s a trick he pulls often on “pom pom”—a potentially enjoyable track is thrown away, and the remainder of its runtime is filled with unintelligible garbage. It is clear that Pink has the ability to write a compelling pop song: “Put Your Number in My Phone” is a wispy hipster seduction reminiscent of Paul McCartney. But Pink is much more interested in making statements than creating catchy songs.
Sometimes Pink’s social commentary is successful. On “Sexual Athletics,” Pink parodies the sex-obsession of modern pop culture. “I'm a sexual athlete /  I'm sweet /  Eat raw meat /  Don't admit to defeat /  Some say it's bittersweet,” Pink states with a distorted deadpan delivery. Here, Pink is both funny and catchy. He is making a joke that listeners can understand, and the delivery is fun. Toward the end of the song, a chorus emerges and sings Pink’s lyrics in a gospel-esque chant. The song is campy, over-the-top, and ridiculous. But as opposed to much of the album, its irony is fun—and not just for the songwriter.
Some of Pink’s explorations into sexual themes are less successful. “Nude Beach a G-Go,” a peppy surf-rock number, might be cute if the artist were a 12-year-old boy. “Black Ballerina” is even more concerning. What would have been a funky tribute to some of the goofiest pop from the ’80s gets a bit too weird at the halfway point when the song breaks into a dialogue between a grandfather and a young boy. The grandfather forces the obviously uncomfortable boy to go to a strip club, and the ensuing scene leaves a sour taste in the listener’s mouth that can’t be washed out by a catchy hook. If it is another one of Pink’s jokes, it falls flat.
And yet, in the final stretch of the two-sided album, Pink almost redeems himself. In “Picture Me Gone,” a parent meditates on death while looking into the lens of an iPhone camera during a selfie. Pink sings in a gentle croon, and the track is surprisingly poignant. The final track, “Dayzed Inn Daydreams,” is the catchiest on the album, and it makes sense that an album so removed from reality would end on a song about dreaming. “I used to dream / dream away / hide in the dark / fade into grey,” Pink repeats, backed by a chorus. Its nostalgia for bygone pop is strong enough to suggest that pop music, for Pink, isn’t just a platform for in-jokes and self-indulgence. He cares about this stuff, but either out of insecurity, boredom, or laziness, he chooses to steep his music in tired irony instead of putting out a record he believes in.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
February, not April, is the cruelest month.
For it was on a mid-February day that I learned of John Updike’s death of lung cancer in Jan. 2009. The emotion that I felt was not proper grief—I knew I had not known the man well enough to presume such a depth of loss. We’d only met in the dream of his books. All the same, I had a moment of dumb clawing at the universe. It seemed a double injury: he’d been dead for almost a month already, and in my stupidity, as I hadn’t even known I’d lost him, I’d still been dreaming back in January, fancying me and John could wind up chatting one day on some taciturn street in America. Why had I never written him anything—a letter, an email—to declare my gratitude for his magnificent sentences? People always underestimate their time together.
“Higher Gossip” (2012), a kind of chattering astride the grave, is the closest I’ll ever get to the Updike I missed on his way out. It was published posthumously through the efforts of his estate editor Christopher Carduff, his widow Martha, and friends of the deceased who helped collect and sift what Carduff, in his elegant introduction, calls “Updike’s many fugitive pieces.” They certainly rounded up a load of fugitives. At nearly 500 pages, the book is hefty if not obese. The sample warblings inside come from all periods of the writer’s career: short stories from his early days, a handful of good poems, a wonderful discourse on “Humor in Fiction,” assessments of writers’ lives, brilliant book reviews, art essays, golf essays, and sundry other pieces.
The incredible thing about Updike, a quality rarely native to any other contemporary writer, is that his unmistakable prodding touch is discernable in each miscellaneous fragment, however stray. One need only to look at him nail El Greco’s paintings: “these large, lurid, hyper-Catholic canvases, with their tormented compositions and insipidly pretty, pasty faces.” Or the moment of hitting a good golf shot: “When you connect, it’s the whistle of a quail, it’s the soar of a hawk, it’s the sighting of a planet hitherto unseen; it’s mathematical perfection wrested from a half-buried lie; it’s absolute.” Or the death of his fellow novelist Kurt Vonnegut: “Everyone who knew Kurt, I think it safe to say, misses him. Indeed, it might be said that the planet misses him.” Has anyone said it better?
Updike was fascinated with everything in the world, a veritable humanist astronaut. He is also a humorous observer, though a supremely self-conscious one whose strains of narcissism and misogyny, present here as elsewhere in his work, are probably only rescued by his being John Updike. In the Updike-on-Updike-type pieces he is touchingly modest about his distinctiveness, referring to himself as “a more or less elderly, in some remote sense eminent person.” Yet behind the lighthearted ‘oh, please’ of the gentleman writer toils the serious artist. In “The Writer in Winter,” the book’s opening piece, Updike confesses to a fear of losing his touch: “With ominous frequency, I can’t think of the right word.” Still, even while struggling more in these final productions, he fulfills his own dictum: “Prose should have a flow, the forward momentum of a certain energized weight; it should feel like a voice tumbling into your ear.”
In early spring of this year, when I picked up “Higher Gossip” from a shelf at the public library, it was like embracing a beloved friend that time and the world had estranged from me. I already had a significant chunk of Updike under my belt—his great novels “The Centaur” and “The Witches of Eastwick”; “Still Looking,” an essay collection on American art; “Museums and Women,” a short story collection; one of the “Bech” books, a series on the misadventures of Updike’s alter ego, Jewish writer Henry Bech; and “Midpoint,” a poetry collection. For some time I had been meaning to get around to the famous “Rabbit” tetralogy, but the oppressive feeling of ‘one ought to read it’ had its part in stalling those plans. Now, though, it was so easy to put aside my spring plans to read “In Search of Lost Time” and take up the offer of a liaison with, among other engulfing distractions, this unsanctioned Updikean pseudopod. Such jocund company!
Looking back, I know it was not the right time for Proust. I was taking a semester off from Harvard to stay at home, read for pleasure, write, and think about how to live well. Proust’s slow and brutal realism can be icicles in the heart; I had just left a bitter cold February, and I was looking for warmth. “Higher Gossip” had it. The idea of “gossip” Updike refers to, half-jokingly, is not the “Gossip Girl” type we might have in mind, but rather a more quaintly improper manner of dishing out intimate details about life. In a reflection on the way people wrote in the times of James Buchanan, Updike wonders uneasily, “Will people talk about each other so avidly again, or fashion of the lives of those they know such a treasure of polished nuggets and gimcracks of gossip? How telegraphic, how unloving, by comparison, our own gossip is!”

As a Shakespeare “problem play,” so named because it delicately toes the line between cookie-cutter comedy and tragedy, “Pericles” can be difficult to stage. However, the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production that ran in the Adams Pool Theater from Nov. 7 to 9 managed to do it—and well, due to a strong core of actors. Directed by Matthew H. Munroe ’17 and produced by Rachel A. Harner ’17, “Pericles, Prince of Tyre” presented a compelling tale of trial and tribulation for its namesake protagonist (Nathaniel J. Brodsky ’18). He almost comically encounters tragedy after tragedy including fires, sea storms, and the presumed death of his wife Thaisa (Lily K. Calcagnini ’18)  and daughter Marina (Julia Belanoff ’18)—before arriving at a long-awaited family reunion and a happy ending.
The production took the characters from the courts of ancient Greece to a new setting: the circus. Though the language remained Shakespearean, this circus setting was reflected in several of the characters: narrator Gower, played by Michaela J. Kane ’18, fit seamlessly into the role of a ringmaster; Bronte Lim ’18’s portrayal of noble Cerimon as a fortune teller added mystique to her uncannily accurate predictions; Marina’s role as a tightrope walker mirrored her own struggles in navigating innocence and maturity. Leib I. Celnik ’18 and Aidan Campbell ’17 played the Fishermen, reimagined as circus clowns, adding a new contrast between the clowns’ garishly cheerful attire and their dark comments.
Though the set was relatively simple—the main set elements were a canvas painted like a striped circus tent and a few wooden boxes—the design transformed the muted tones of the Adams Pool Theater into a vivid and fitting backdrop for a circus show. The design proved extremely versatile: minimal additions were made for different scenes: for example, adding a lavishly decorated table for a feast scene and a tawdry “brothel” sign to denote a location change later in the play. Apt lighting choices also allowed for the development of different moods: a warm, wistful golden wash for a death scene, a cool range of blues for the many sea storms that occur throughout the play, a clean white glow for the timid conversation that leads to the reunion of Pericles and Marina. Music was also effectively used—thunder and rain sounds for the storms at sea, and a playfully loose classical waltz for a dance scene at a banquet. The elements of sound and set shifted throughout the play to support the storyline and added to the believability of the storm's devastation and the joy of the reunions.
Since this “Pericles” production featured a cast of just 11, it was important that each actor delivered well. This proved to be the case, and actor talent drove the play. Kane’s use of sweeping hand gestures and vocal inflections in her portrayal of narrator and ringmaster Gower contributed to a sense of grandiosity that fully transported the audience from the Adams Pool to a timeless circus. Brodsky’s thoughtful, assured demeanor as Pericles made it easy for the audience to get behind his character. Actors who played doubles—such as Calcagnini in her portrayal of Thaisa and Diana, and Aislinn E. Brophy ’17 in her portrayal of Dionyza, Bawd, Second Fisherman, and Daughter—were largely able to use differing stances and attitudes to portray through body language the shift from one character to another.
Despite those successful character changes, the fact remains that 11 actors cannot play 20 characters without flaws. As a result, the majority of actors played two parts, and though wigs and other costume elements were used to differentiate between the parts, seeing the same faces in each scene led to an overall feeling of confusion as audience members scrambled to figure out who was portraying who and who was now portraying a different who. Another point of confusion was the increasing difficulty of incorporating a circus show into Pericles’s antics throughout the play—as Pericles travels between countries, gets lost, and encounters governors, royals, and political officials, the audience is left to wonder how the circus roles play into it.
Despite its shortcomings, the play does have its poignant moments. When Marina is kidnapped by pirates and sent to work at a brothel, Belanoff’s honest courage in the face of having her virginity “auctioned off” to the highest bidder is touching. Though Pericles’s capacity for being the victim of tragic life events is almost astounding, Brodsky’s experience of the trials and tribulations tend to generate empathy rather than pity in the audience, and there is a sense of relief in the play’s happy ending. “Pericles” reminds us that, though there are always rough patches in life, it gets better. After all, “all’s well that ends well.”

If the love of your life and father of your children abandoned you for a younger woman, what would you do? And what if you had magical forces at your disposal? You might or might not go as far as Medea, the passionate antihero of the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Seneca’s Medea,” running from Nov. 20 to Nov. 23.
The play takes place after the events of “Jason and the Argonauts.”  In the preceding story, the Greek hero Jason escapes from Colchis with the help of the sorceress Medea. After being married to her for several years, though, Jason decides to reject Medea in favor of Creusa, the daughter of Creon and the princess of Corinth. Thus begins “Seneca’s Medea,” chronicling the day before the wedding as Medea tries to decide whether or not to take revenge.
Medea is not a completely sympathetic figure, but the longevity of the play evidences her power as a character. Though extreme, Medea’s descent into madness and fluctuation between love and hatred speak to universal emotions. “It’s somehow ageless,” Juliette Cremel ’17, who plays Medea, says. “She has a lot of sides that all of us have in ourselves, even if most of us obviously don’t take it that far.”
There are two versions of “Medea”—Euripedes’s original play and Seneca’s later adaptation, which this production chooses to use. According to the cast, while the original play concentrates on plot and drama, Seneca’s version pays more attention to inner motivations and feelings. “This ‘Medea’ is a lot more psychological,” actor Eli B. Schleicher ’17, who plays Jason, says. “It focuses less on the violence—Medea’s a very violent character—and more on the mental games she plays with people.”
Seneca’s version also features beautifully poetic speeches, largely because it was originally designed to be recited rather than acted out. Preserving the lush language become the job of the Harvard Classics Club, who did the translation themselves. “It’s exciting to do a student translation,” Schleicher says. “Straight translation…keeps to what has been written technically, but there is still a lot that can be done with word choice.”
One such innovative choice, a decision of director Veronica S. Wickline ’16, was to retain some of the original Latin alongside the English translations. “There was something about the solemnity of the Latin that captured what a very long poetic piece was trying to say,” Wickline says.
And the cast insists that viewers should not be deterred by the play’s classical nature. “A lot of our work has gone into making it accessible,” Schleicher says. “And making it exciting, making it emotional.” Besides, the play features both hyperbolic insanity and an original composition for the Irish pennywhistle. What’s not to like?

To the editor:
Two years ago, I heard Colorado State Senator Michael C. Johnston address a diverse gathering of educators at the Education Nation conference: teachers and principals from all over the country and from all types of public schools.
In that address, I was struck by his lucidity and his thoughtfulness. Johnston speaks and writes as one who had spent a lot of time pondering complex issues. This makes sense, as he’s faced those issues firsthand; as an educator, he worked in some of our country’s most challenging environments. After teaching in Mississippi, Johnston led two of Colorado’s alternative schools, placements that often end up as final stops for the children our schools can’t figure out how to teach. Most importantly, Johnston seems driven to ensure that all our schools serve children as they deserve, giving them the opportunity to reach their fullest potentials—a standard of excellence that no one, I think, would seriously argue we’ve reached.
I was surprised, then, to see that petitioners are protesting his invitation to speak at the Graduate School of Education’s convocation. Their statement asserts that “Johnston embraces a vision of education reform that relies heavily on test-based accountability while weakening the due process protections of teachers, a vision that we believe ultimately harms students and communities.” On these grounds, they call for the Graduate School of Education to rescind Johnston’s invitation.
Reasonable people who care about children can disagree on the best ways to improve our schools. To think differently is to ignore valid concerns and make productive dialogue impossible. All over the country, educators are working on solutions to persistent problems—how do we serve kids who come from challenging environments, who enter school behind their peers in reading and math, or who have a wide range of special needs? How do we ensure that under-resourced urban and rural schools get students to where they need to be, and how can we make the American public school system a model for the world once again?
No group has a monopoly on these answers. To shut out the wisdom and experience of an entire swath of educators—charter or traditional, union or reform, Democrat or Republican—is to deny the best shot to actual children who, as you read this, are not getting the education they deserve for want of those answers.
I am not a student at the GSE. I sympathize with those who have worked hard to gain knowledge and skills that will help them serve students and who now find themselves unenthused by their school’s choice of speaker at their convocation. I also respect the conviction of those who challenge a perspective that they believe will not help children.
But given the raging debates in our field, it’s certain that any speech that everyone agreed with would be boring and useless. As an educator and a member of the greater Harvard community, I hope that sharp conversations about these subjects would be welcome at our University.

As news outlets from CNN to the New Yorker have pointed out, the successes of President Obama’s trip to Asia last week were a welcome reprieve for a chief executive smarting from a disastrous midterm cycle. In coming to an agreement on carbon emissions with China, the president secured a diplomatic accomplishment that could transcend the current news cycle and mark a turning point in the fight against global climate change. Given the current political composition of Congress, these lofty possibilities may not be realistic. But with the growing threat of climate change, political commitment to reducing carbon emissions is long overdue.
The significance of the climate accord reached last week is that it finally included China, the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, in a global climate change agreement. Early accords—notably 1997’s Kyoto Protocol—fell apart because of China’s exemption, which provided countries like the United States with a ready-made excuse to remain on the sidelines. Under President Obama, the U.S. has improved its position on carbon reduction, but China’s absence from global agreements has been conspicuous. With this new deal, the countries whose cooperation is most needed to slow climate change have made a commitment, before the world, to carry out serious shifts in how they produce energy.
The agreement, of course, is not perfect. As John Cassidy noted in the New Yorker, many major environmental groups offered significant support, but at least two added that the agreement is not sufficient to prevent many of the consequences of climate change, which are likely irreversible given current trends. As a UN report from this month made clear, these effects will be severe. Moreover, China has only committed to reach peak emissions at “around 2030,” a target for which it must be held accountable.
Still, the rich world cannot expect poor countries to adopt stringent emissions standards while carbon-emitting sources of energy remain the cheapest available. As the New York Times put it, before this accord, “China has long argued that it should not have to commit to cutting carbon pollution, since its energy consumption helped fuel the rise of its rural poor population to the middle class.” India is now making a similar case. In short, the developing world will not simply stop developing, nor should it. Only as cleaner technologies become more available more affordably will poor countries be able to rely on green development to lift their populations out of poverty.
For such development to become a reality, more decisive leadership from China and especially the United States is needed. Unfortunately, this month’s elections saw American voters elect a Congress ill-suited to keep pace with the goals outlined Beijing. According to PolitiFact, only about three percent of Republican representatives and senators have openly acknowledged the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Worse, the new Republican majority in the Senate will likely make Senator Jim Inhofe, a noted climate change denier, chair of the Environmental and Public Works Committee. Barring an improbable shift, significant legislation to limit the United States’ carbon emissions will have to wait two or more years.
This unfavorable political context is troubling. Last week’s agreement will only work if signs of serious commitment follow, and such commitment will require a serious shift in the political feasibility of climate change legislation in the United States. Failing that, President Obama’s trip to Asia may simply be remembered as a missed opportunity.

It’s UC presidential campaign season at Harvard. The sandwich boards outside the Science Center are plastered with promises of reform, free food, and alcohol funding. Facebook newsfeeds are awash with flashy campaign logos. And at a recent Crimson-hosted debate, current President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 could be seen swigging from a flask.
To their credit, all the Undergraduate Council presidential tickets have tackled serious financial issues in their campaign platforms. But there has been disappointingly little use of economic reasoning this election season. In this new Clark-Mayopoulos-Goffard era of comedic governance, Homo Economicus thought he could kill two birds with one stone by offering some lighthearted campus improvements based on economic theory. So, how could an economist improve Harvard?
In his first act as UC President, Homo Economicus would propose a markets-based solution to silence the Lowell Bells. The ringing of the bells is a commonly acknowledged public bad: every Sunday afternoon, residents of nearby houses (not to mention poor Lowellians) are subjected to tuneless renditions of top 40 hits and butchered old classics. The sound of the bells is unfortunately both non-rival and non-excludible. This is a textbook case of market failure.
Enter the Undergraduate Council. Banning the bells outright would be counter to the economic spirit of free choice—as hard as it may be to believe, there may exist a few students who derive utility from having the tranquility of Sunday afternoon broken by dissonant chiming. The correct solution would be market-based: with the coordination of the UC, the Quincy, Leverett, and Winthrop House Committees could offer financial incentives to Lowell to end the bells’ tintinnabulation. Lowell would ask for a price commensurate to the (questionable) utility lost from no longer ringing the bells, and the affected neighbors would offer a price proportionate to the disutility inflicted upon them.
There may also be a markets-based solution to the perennial freshman fear of being Quadded. As UC President, Homo Economicus would push for the creation of insurance contracts which pay off if a student is Quadded. Quad-averse students could purchase these contracts as a hedge; the cash windfall from being Quadded would offset some of the shock of realizing that it takes 20 minutes to get to class. To improve allocative efficiency, these Quad insurance contracts could be packaged, securitized, and traded on an open exchange like credit default swaps. It’s hard to see what would go wrong.
Finally, President Homo Economicus would seek to abolish mandatory Board Plus. Like Obamacare, BoardPlus redistributes wealth from light users to heavy users. Unlike Obamacare, Board Plus makes little sense. Students who do not frequent Greenhouse and Lamont Cafe should not be forced to pay into a service they do not use; the program should be opt-in rather than mandatory. Like many Harvard students, Homo Economicus was forced to go on a Greenhouse Cafe shopping spree at the end of last semester in a last-ditch attempt to exhaust his Board Plus balance. Diminishing marginal returns has no better illustration than the attempted consumption of ten Odwalla smoothies in a single sitting. Ending mandatory Board Plus would prevent such wasteful spending.
Admittedly, economists have not historically had a successful track record in the political arena. The logic of utility maximization does not translate well in speaking to voters. In a recent example, Italy’s Mario Monti, a technocratic economist, was booted out of the prime ministership after less than two years in office. In the UC election, Homo Economicus’s proposals would likely fall flat compared to crowd-pleasers like nap spaces and weekend Quad shuttles.
Perhaps a Homo Economicus candidacy can wait. He will consult his cousin Homo Politicus in the mean time for advice.

Many people saw this month’s national elections, in which the Republicans took the Senate and kept control of the House, as a reflection of the American public’s decreasing support of President Barack Obama.
For the Republicans, the victory was a sign that the public prefers the Republican Party platform of lowering taxes, decreasing government regulation, breaking down the Affordable Care Act, and constructing the Keystone pipeline, among other planks, over Obama’s positions of focusing on job creation, investing in infrastructure, and  implementing the new healthcare system.
Democrats, conversely, interpreted this election as a sign that they have not adequately fulfilled all of their promises to the American people. Obama himself declared that he must take responsibility for the Democratic loss in the midterm elections.
But they are all missing the boat: The election should not be centered on party platforms at all. Platforms should only relevant insofar as an individual candidates supports aspects of the party platform. That’s not to say that candidates’ party membership is completely irrelevant, however party affiliation is important as a signpost of a candidate’s general positions—but only as a signpost. From it, we can infer how a candidate will lean on certain issues and what his or her position might be on issues not discussed during the campaign.
But the statements that candidates issue—and the topics that they concentrate on during the election—are much more important than the party positions and priorities that the candidates abstractly ascribe to. Just as not all members of one party agree, so too is voting for one member of a party not meant to be a general statement of support for the party’s national body.
This election should have been more than a vote on party platforms, and it also should have been more than a vote of confidence in Obama. Members of Congress can do so much more than pass or reject the president’s proposed or supported legislation: They craft their own bills, approve federal official appointees, and shape American foreign policy. The term “midterm elections” is consequently in many ways a misnomer. Yes, the elections fall in the middle of the president’s four-year term. But the electorate is voting on people who will begin new terms, whose elections should not be defined solely by the presidential calendar.
It is not only that Congress as a whole should be seen as separate from the executive, however. Candidates themselves must be viewed as separate and distinct from each other. Every district and state has its own specific needs based on its demographics, industrial profile, unemployment rate, and its prevailing, often idiosyncratic, ideology and outlook.
When voting, people should think about what they most want from a candidate, and what candidate would be best for their district or state. While they should also consider which candidates would do their best for the country, they should do this on a case-by-case basis, recognizing that even if they wanted a certain party-affiliated ideology to dominate Washington, voting for candidates exclusively of that party might not even fulfill this desire.
If the Republicans won because much of the country is dissatisfied with Obama, these next two years will be very long ones indeed. American citizens will have to accept legislatures whose positions they may not have actually individually supported. But if the Republicans won the majority because individually, each state and district thought that its candidate would best represent it and endorse only legislation that its electorate would support, then maybe even those who are not Republicans nevertheless have something to celebrate.

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has broken the previously “unwritten rule” that terror organizations generally refrain from killing foreign journalists, journalist Jeffrey Goldberg argued Tuesday in a talk at the Kennedy School of Government.
The terrorist group’s recent public beheadings of journalists was a prominent topic in the discussion. Even after Pakistani militants kidnapped journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002, Goldberg said, American journalists were generally thought to be protected by their status as foreign correspondents.
“Even after Danny Pearl was murdered, a lot of us, me included, thought that it was an exception to the rule,” said Goldberg, a national correspondent for “The Atlantic” who knew Pearl personally. “The literal thought I had was: Those guys broke the rules.”
As a result of ISIS’s recent tactics, journalism in the fraught area has become far more dangerous than it used to be, Goldberg said.
Previously, he argued, the groups operated with an understanding of a “contract,” in which terrorist organizations disseminated their message, and journalists showed “how appalling they are.” The advent of YouTube and Twitter, however, meant that terrorist groups no longer needed the “middleman” to convey their message, he said.
Goldberg was blunt about the difficulties reporters face in covering the Middle East, interspersing his analysis with wry jokes.
He grew somber, however, when discussing the late American journalist Steven Sotloff, whom ISIS beheaded earlier this year. Years ago, Goldberg said, Sotloff asked him for advice about going to the Middle East.
Today, Goldberg said at the talk, he cannot in “good conscience” tell anyone to go near the conflict in the region.
“There are incredibly negatives to this,” he said. “It’s very important for America to have American journalists on the ground. But I’m not going to ever again tell someone to risk their life for a story.”
In response to a question from an audience member, Goldberg added that the system of hiring freelancers to report in the Middle East is “built for exploitation” and warned that the work there is dangerous.
Goldberg said he now offers aspiring journalists a more cautious message about reporting in the Middle East.
“I made a decision in my own life, not to tell anyone ever again [to follow my path],” he said. “Because something very, very important has changed in the Middle East.”
Audience members praised the talk. Laurie Penny, a fellow at the Nieman Foundation for Journalism who attended, said she found Goldberg’s lecture interesting. She said hearing “talks from journalists with all kinds of different views” is part of the reason why she came to Harvard as a fellow.

Several students at Harvard Law School have organized a new advocacy group to promote discussion about sexual assault and the federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
The group, called “Harvard Talks Title IX” or “HTT9,” was born out of discussion this fall in two courses taught by law professor Charles R. Nesson ’60. Nesson surveyed his students earlier this semester to identify what topic they found most difficult to discuss—the “elephant in the room,” as he described it—and the top response was gender discrimination and equality. Several of his students took the initiative to create the group to promote conversation on that issue.
For now, student members are advancing conversation about sexual assault and Title IX online, primarily over Loomio, a discussion website. The group has applied to become a recognized student group but has not yet received formal approval, according to Nesson, who is the group’s faculty advisor.
Several student members of the group declined to comment on the record for this story.
The group’s formation comes amid broader discussion about sexual assault and Title IX compliance at the Law School and Harvard more generally. The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights is currently investigating the Law School to determine whether its sexual assault policies adhere to Title IX.
Harvard Talks Title IX, for its part, has yet to decide what concrete actions it will take going forward, but according to the group’s forum on Loomio, members have discussed conducting a sexual assault climate survey similar to MIT’s and inviting President Barack Obama or First Lady Michelle Obama to speak at HLS.
Meanwhile, students continue to converse with each other online via Loomio. Those discussions have addressed topics such as affirmative consent, a standard that Harvard’s new University-wide Title IX policy does not explicitly include.
“The major issue that we’ve debated, and are still deliberating, is whether affirmative consent is a preferable standard to guide behavior to unwelcome conduct,” Nesson said. “That’s a very real, concrete question.” Nesson said he hopes to encourage even more of this discussion going forward.

Agriculture advocates argued that Boston has become a national leader in promoting urban farming at a panel discussion at the Law School on Tuesday afternoon.
The event, hosted by the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic and the Harvard Food Law Society, featured  panelists from the City of Boston’s Office of Food Initiatives, the nonprofit organization Trust for Public Land, and Fathom, an information design company that created a mobile application to help farmers find land for urban agriculture in Boston.
Much of the panel conversation centered on Article 89, a city-wide zoning ordinance passed into law in Dec. 2013 that makes it legal for Boston residents to grow and sell their own produce.
Panelist Chris LaPointe, a senior project manager for the Trust for Public Land, cited affordability and accessibility as two challenges faced by urban farmers. Despite these difficulties, panelists agreed that the local government in Boston has been very receptive to proposals designed to make urban agriculture more accessible.
For example, Alex Geller, who works on information design at Fathom, said that when her company first approached City Hall with a proposal for the application, officials were excited about the idea of engaging Boston residents in urban agriculture through technology.
After the event concluded, Allison B. Condra, a senior clinical fellow at the Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, said the group would have needed another hour to continue the discussion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dressed in mostly black cocktail attire and flashing camera-ready smiles, more than 500 students gathered on Nov. 6 to celebrate the opening of the Harvard Art Museums, newly renovated after six years of construction. Multi-colored flutes of nonalcoholic punch coupled with the pulsing beats of two DJs promoted a swanky, trendy vibe primed for the students to mix and mingle amid the art.
The opening signaled administrators’ hopes to make the Museums accessible and attractive to Harvard’s youngest affiliates.
University President Drew G. Faust has said the Museums are designed to serve as a “teaching machine,” as undergraduates, graduate students, and their professors collaborate and imagine new ways to use the Museums’ collection of over 250,000 pieces. Thomas W. Lentz, the director of the Museums, similarly called them “more open” and “accessible” at the Museums’ press opening earlier this month.
Now that the Museums have officially opened to the public, administrators want all students to take advantage of the collections. Certain classes will incorporate the gallery spaces and other facilities into their curricula, and others will direct enrollees to make use of the Museums’ collections on their own.
Some students, too, already have been at work behind the scenes of this Quincy Street institution. By designing public tours of the facilities, these students have become involved in the day-to-day life of the Fogg, Busch-Reisinger, and Arthur M. Sackler Museums—now all grouped under one “Harvard Art Museums” moniker. Administrators hope the renovation will push Harvard students to interact with art in a new, educational way.
“It’s not just for showing a beautiful collection of art,” architect Renzo Piano said of the Museums at a press opening. “It’s for studying.”
INTERACTIVE CLASSROOMS
Administrators at the newly renovated Harvard Art Museums, and the professors who plan to integrate various collections into their syllabi, say that they hope the facilities will fundamentally change how undergraduates interact with and think about art in their courses.
In total, four specific galleries in the Museums are dedicated to undergraduate coursework. Those galleries play a huge role in how the Museums function as classrooms, said Jessica L. Martinez ’95, the Museums’ director of academic and public programs.
These spaces will act as a “springboard” for further student inquiry and research, chief curator Deborah M. Kao said at the Museums’ press opening.
One of these spaces, the University Study Gallery, features one large display case that will showcase works selected by faculty members who want to incorporate the works into their course curricula.
“Faculty can select works from our storage—they can be installed for a day, a week, a month, the semester—to support their classes,” Martinez said.
Museums administrators hope that students across disciplines will benefit from the collections through their General Education courses, whose faculty instructors will have priority in installing exhibitions in the University Study Gallery.
“We really love that Gen Ed wants to bring the [aesthetic] disciplines into students’ lives, and we want to bring collections into students’ lives,” Martinez said. “When you go in, there is this wonderful juxtaposition of works that you wouldn’t typically see in other galleries, because it is the selection of professors from this range of classes.”
This gallery also functions in tandem with the Art Study Center, a space on the Museums’ fourth floor that offers students the chance to engage with works of art firsthand. Students can request to view works in person in natural light, without glass in between them and the art, according to the Museums’ deputy director, Maureen I. Donovan, who led a tour of the new facilities at the press opening.
The Art Study Center seems to take everything a student might need into account. Before interacting with the art, students can stash away their backpacks in individual lockers with built-in locks. Researchers can convene without disturbing others and take breaks from their work in a hallway off the center.
The second undergraduate-based gallery, the University Teaching Gallery, is devoted to History of Art and Architecture classes. Three HAA classes will use this gallery in the spring: Suzanne P. Blier’s HAA 194w: “Worlds Fairs,” Yukio Lippit’s HAA 18p: “The Japanese Woodblock Print,” and Melissa M. McCormick’s HAA 18k: “Introduction to Japanese Art.”
Blier said she hopes her exhibition will help students see the importance of viewing images in person, rather than on a screen, which she said often misrepresents artistic features including scale, three-dimensionality, and texture.
“[The University Teaching Gallery] will be really important in having students begin to look really closely at works of art and works of visual culture more generally,” Blier said. “You’re able to look closely at these images and in essence discover the world anew.”
For now, HAA professors will curate installations for their classes in the gallery, but in the future, students may have a chance to test their hands at selecting which pieces go on display, Martinez said.
The Museums’ other facilities were also built with teaching students in mind. In the Materials Lab, on the lower level of the building, visiting artists and conservators will lead workshops with students to demonstrate how the galleries’ various works were created, according to Kao.
“[It’s] the place for exploring materials that art is made with—so just a different kind of classroom,” Donovan said.
BEYOND THE CLASSROOM
For students who take the initiative to participate behind the scenes, administrators hope that the Harvard Art Museums can go even further as teaching tools.
Through their participation in an advisory board, convened last spring, 19 students have already played a part in rolling out events at the renovated Museums. These board members, 15 undergraduates and four graduate students, were instrumental in planning the student opening event earlier this month. Now that the building has opened its doors, Martinez and the advisory board still want to keep students in mind.
“The question really is: how do we include students in the thinking and the development of this project?” Martinez asked. “How might they push our thinking? And how might they—in every way—give us different access?”
Beyond the students who sit on the existing advisory board, another group of 18 students will serve as liaisons between the Museums and greater Cambridge through leading tours of the collections. In this way, there is a role reversal: Administrators hope that these students can act as teachers to advance the educational mission of the Museums, rather than just receive it.
These students, called student guides, will lead the public tours starting in February. The guides are now trying their hands at curating as they brainstorm how best to engage visitors.
“We’re not coming up with a script for them,” said David R. Odo, the Museums’ director of student programs. “We are working with them as a group to think of a structure and a framework [for the tours], and each individual guide creates his or her own tour.”
Because guides can cater their tours to their own interests, each one will highlight different paintings, sculptures, and other works of art in the building. There are thousands of pieces each tour could highlight, and there are many arguments and presentations each tour could make, according to Krystle M.C. Leung ’15, a senior student guide.
“What we’re all trying to do is to balance the media [featured on each tour],” Leung said. “[The style] depends on what each of the guides is interested in.”
Edwin L. Whitman ’15 and Dylan F. Perese ’16, also student guides, are taking still another step to get involved with the Museums: They have been working on an app, called Sightlines, that guides visitors through the Museums with exercises, podcasts, and videos that feature Harvard affiliates discussing their favorite pieces in the collections.
The app aims to break down the preconceived idea that “you have to be a History of Art and Architecture concentrator” to feel at home in a museum, Perese said.
Through work like this, Museum administrators hope that undergraduates will benefit educationally from the renovated space, whether students visit the Museums with a professor or choose to ramp up their own involvement.
“We want every inch of this museum to feel like a classroom space, but we also hope that students... understand that this is a place where they can come for a moment in between,” Martinez said. “Maybe it’s the seven minutes in between Harvard classes—that might be enough for a student to move away from the hustle and bustle of their very busy lives.”

Twenty-five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, NBC’s Tom Brokaw—the only network anchor who reported live from Brandenburg Gate the night of Nov. 9, 1989—shared memories of witnessing the historic event while speaking at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday.
“It was one of those moments in history where the world, overnight, changed,” said Brokaw, who anchored NBC Nightly News for 22 years.
Brokaw attributed his presence that night in Berlin to a stroke of luck. He had come to Berlin to attend a press conference, where he did not expect any major announcements to be made.
“We had no idea that the wall would come down on my watch,” Brokaw said.
Brokaw had previously scheduled an interview with Günter Schabowski, a then-official of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, for after the press conference. The interview became of global significance after Schabowski accidently announced that East Germans were free to travel through the wall to West Germany.
“He didn’t know what the hell he was talking about,” Brokaw said of Schabowski’s statement.
At Tuesday’s event, Brokaw played footage from his original broadcast from the border of East and West Germany.
“Good evening live from the Berlin Wall on the most historic night in this wall’s history,” a younger Brokaw said in the recording.
“The wall as we have known it since 1961—a sinister symbol of oppression—the wall has changed dramatically tonight,” the broadcast continued, followed by a round of applause from the audience at the Institute of Politics.
Brokaw described wondering throughout the broadcast whether or not then-President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev would send tanks from Moscow.
When the gates finally opened in relative peace, Brokaw described the flow of citizens out of East Germany as “like watching creatures of the moon arrive on earth.”
Brokaw also shared behind-the-scenes stories, including an anecdote about his wife, who fell asleep early and missed his broadcast. To spurts of laughter, Brokaw said she only became aware of the news and her husband’s role while speaking to a passerby on a walk with her dog in Central Park the following morning.
Brokaw concluded his speech with a question-and-answer session with the audience, during which he addressed some of his responses to student journalists in attendance.
“And for the young journalists in the room, the last thought that went through my mind before I said, ‘good evening,’ was, ‘Don’t screw this up Brokaw,’” he said.

The Office of Student Life will host a series of discussions to gather student and faculty feedback on potential improvements to the College’s current system for reporting instances of bias, harassment, and discrimination, according to Emelyn A. dela Peña, assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
The discussions—which will likely include focus groups, town hall meetings, a working group, and an online forum—come as a response to the emailed death threat sent to several hundred Harvard affiliates, many of whom were Asian women, last month, dela Peña said.
In an Oct. 31 email regarding the ongoing investigation into the death threat, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana pledged that administrators would work to improve the College’s bias reporting system. In his email, Khurana wrote that the administration would “fully engage the College community throughout this process.”
Currently, the OSL’s website encourages students who believe they have been victims of bias, harassment, or discrimination to contact their House masters, House deans, or one of the College’s five hearing officers.
Dela Peña said she hopes student awareness of existing resources will grow through the process of rethinking the current reporting system.
“I think a lot of people are under the impression that we don’t have a bias reporting system, and we do,” she said, explaining that the contact information for the hearing officers can be found in the College’s Handbook for Students.
“We realized that there are places in our bias reporting system that can be strengthened,” dela Peña said, adding that the current system is designed for bias-related discrimination in situations where there is a clear complainant and respondent.
The system currently in place is not well-equipped to handle incidents like the emailed death threats, which involved hundreds of people, many of whom did not report the incident, dela Peña said.
“We’re just trying to be proactive now, trying to think about all the different contingencies that might happen within a case of a hate crime, bias-related incident, harassment, or discrimination,” she said.

Harvard Medical School professor George M. Church discussed the intersection of biotechnology and entrepreneurship in a lecture Tuesday.
The talk, titled “Wild Biotechnology,” was hosted by the Harvard Biotech Entrepreneurs, a student group focused on promoting interest in careers in biotechnology on campus. The group reached out to Church because “he’s truly a leader in the field,” club member John M. Elkington ’15 said.
Church discussed the work of biotechnicians in his lab who are studying the possibilities of reprogramming an organism’s nucleus to mimic a human being’s genome. One line of inquiry has been xenotransplantation, the process of growing human-compatible organs in animals like pigs, creating cells that scientists can use to develop and market new drugs.
“It’s about figuring out what personalized medicine of the future will be,” Church said. “It might take me 10, 20 years [to grow a heart from stem cells], while a pig could be on tap all the time.”
These human “organoids” provide more realistic models for study than cells on a Petri dish because they more closely resemble human DNA, Church said.
“You can make pigs that are essentially much closer to being universal donors,” Church said. “If it works, their organs will be going into people like you and me.”
Researchers at Church’s lab are also investigating applications of gene therapy—the rewriting of genetic code—in controlling diseases, pests, and invasive species.
“The hope is to make malaria [and other diseases] become extinct,” Church said.
Grounded in this genetics research, Church’s lab has helped launch 14 startups prior to this year, and researchers and postdocs are currently creating about six more. Church emphasized the importance of taking lab results to a broader market.
“How do you get things out of your head, out of your lab, and into the world?” Church asked. “If you’re not part of the economic community, there’s a chance…you’ll fall behind.”
Students responded to Church’s work with excitement.
“Right now in biotech, everything is expanding at an exponential rate.... Ten years ago [Church’s work] was science fiction,” Erik C. Owen ’18 said.
Max E. Zacher ’15 said he appreciated Church’s eagerness to discuss new developments, like editing the genetic code of a wild species.
“A lot of scientists can be conservative, but he’s not afraid to talk about new technologies,” Zacher said.
Church said he hopes that the lecture will encourage students to consider careers with biotech startups, as opposed to their Internet-based counterparts.
“The rewards for biotechnology are tremendous—to solve disease, eliminate poverty, age gracefully,” Church said. “It sounds so much cooler than Facebook.”

The United States and India have much to learn from each other about the development of philanthropy and corporate social responsibility, according to panelists at a discussion hosted by the South Asia Institute at the Harvard Faculty Club on Tuesday.
Moderated by Harvard Business School associate professor Alnoor Ebrahim, the panel featured Rohini Nilekani, the founder and chairperson of the Arghyam Foundation, and Geeta Pradhan, an executive at the Boston Foundation. Though the two work in different philanthropic landscapes, both emphasized the role that non-governmental and philanthropic organizations play in tackling problems that governments and markets fail to address.
“Philanthropic capital should go where markets will not go, and where the state cannot go,” Nilekani said. “It is only when we build out a very strong society that you can have accountable government and accountable markets.”
Nilekani and Pradhan cited the similar context created by the “devolution of government”—the decentralization of social welfare programs in both countries in the late 20th century—which saddled municipal governments with administrative and social burdens that the private philanthropy sector has stepped in to shoulder.
To that end, Nilekani said, “I spend my philanthropy capital on doing things that help build out people’s institutions.”
Rather than give rural Indian townships water filters, for instance, the Arghyam Foundation has worked with communities to levy social pressure on municipalities to distribute clean water more efficiently.
Targeted efforts like Nilekani’s, according to Pradhan, stand in contrast to current inefficiencies in U.S. philanthropic activity.
“Here, one of the biggest issues is that the cost of transactions is very high and the sector has become very professionalized,” Pradhan said. “It has become a job sector in and of itself.” She noted that the NGO sector accounts for nearly 14 percent of Massachusetts employment.
Pradhan, in turn, suggested that Indian organizations should adopt the Boston Foundation’s model of “community mobilization,” which allows many private donors to contribute to a central, public fund. She also said that incentives for corporate philanthropy in India are often misaligned by current “social responsibility” laws that require larger firms to allocate 2 percent of profits to philanthropic activity.
While the panelists focused on the benefits of philanthropic reform, discussion attendees observed that a conflict often remains between economic development and philanthropic efforts to preserve natural resources. Harvard Law School doctoral student Erum Sattar noted that “the question often becomes, what should governments do—expedite job creation at the expense of the environment now, or act as the long-term custodians of the natural environment?”
Nilekani and Pradham also acknowledged the problem of state abdication of social welfare responsibilities.
“Philanthropy has a limited, but important role to play,” Nilekani said.  “And it must continue to evolve.”

Before every game is the meeting.
Every Wednesday before a home football game, members of the Harvard Department of Athletics sit down to walk through duties for the upcoming Saturday. Together, the people in that room are responsible for everything from the preparation of the field to the cleaning of the grounds, from the tweeting in anticipation to the Instagramming in celebration. Behind the scenes at every football game is a fine-tuned Harvard Athletics operation every bit as efficient as the undefeated team it prepares to showcase.
It’s two hours prior to the start of the Crimson’s home season opener, and the region around the stadium has not yet come to life. But the scene inside the Harvard ticketing office is bustling.
Ticket manager Nick Majocha stands in the middle of it all. Hunkered down inside the ground floor Murr Center office with stacks of tickets scattered throughout, Majocha is busy instructing nine salespeople on gameday procedures.
Some are undergraduate employees in their first day on the job; others have sold and distributed tickets for several seasons and work full-time jobs. A few staffers have already taken their posts at other locations, including a shed out in front of the main office windows, a will call booth, and at the nearby Lavietes Pavilion.
“Be as vocal as you can,” Majocha instructed his salespeople. “Ask people if they need help.”
It’s a job that requires multitasking. In addition to coordinating several locations, Majocha’s office manages ticket claims from families of players, secures cash from gameday sales, and distributes free tickets for the department’s weekly promotions. Customers who experience confusion about how to claim their tickets—for instance, reunion attendees who purchased seats through the Alumni Association and not the athletics ticketing office—are his responsibility.
On a typical day, ticketing locations open two hours before the start of each home football game. While sales windows will look dead for a while, prime time is rapidly approaching—the vast majority of tickets will be sold in the 45 minutes prior to kickoff and the first half hour of the game.
Many fans choose to purchase their seats online in the days leading up to the game. But in-person, gameday sales remain popular for Crimson football games—especially because Harvard Stadium will not be close to capacity unless Yale is in town.
“People don’t want to buy in advance,” Majocha said. “They know that the game’s not going to sell out.... They say, ‘I’m going to see how the weather is,’ and then they buy the tickets.”
Between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. on the night of the Holy Cross opener on Sept. 19, the ticketing office distributed a total of 2,640 stubs—1,164 of which went to undergraduates. Prior to the game, Majocha estimated a crowd of about 15,000. He wasn’t off by much—the official attendance clocked in at 15,132.
According to Majocha, a central priority for the ticketing office is to make it easy for undergraduates—who gain free entrance to all home sporting events—to come out to games.
“Our biggest priority is undergraduate involvement,” Majocha said. “It’s not about revenue at all. We want to get more of them here…. We try anything. We would sit outside their dorm rooms and beg them and give them tickets.”
Not only students have access to free tickets, however. As the Holy Cross game was Harvard Night, the team’s only night game at the Stadium all season, Majocha estimates that roughly 1,200 tickets were distributed cost-free to Harvard faculty, staff, and graduate students the week before the game. The ticketing policy also allows for four free tickets to be given to each player’s family.
The ticketing office also coordinates season ticket sales, although holders represent just a fraction of the gameday crowd. The clientele has remained strikingly consistent in size in recent years. According to Majocha, while there were 510 season ticket holders a decade ago, the number has barely moved since, to 526.
“It’s a loyal base,” Majocha said. “[But] I think this day and age, especially with football, people don’t feel the need to buy a season ticket. They say, ‘I’m going to come to three games; I’ll just buy the ticket when I come.’”
“You have to download the Crimzone app!”
“How do I turn my location services on?”
“I just checked in. Can I get a T-shirt?”
These are just a few of the sounds that make their way over the buzz at the undergraduate tailgate prior to the football team’s opener against Holy Cross as students attempt to confirm their presence with the new Crimzone Rewards app. Hosted by the athletic department’s marketing office, the event sought to get students across the Charles River and into Harvard Stadium.
For marketing manager Andy Vatistas and his department, that’s the number one priority—increasing student involvement and enthusiasm.
“We want to get people here,” Vatistas said. “We want to get people in the seats…and build community and pride in Harvard. Part of that is getting the undergrad students, graduates, and faculty and staff here.”
The student tailgate certainly succeeded in terms of boosting undergraduate attendance. As early as two hours before kickoff, students could be found spinning a raffle wheel or eating free pizza. Others played cornhole or lined up to claim their free T-shirts; for many freshmen, this will be one of the first items in their wardrobe emblazoned with the crimson H.
According to Vatistas, over 700 attendees received shirts, and a number of student tickets were distributed to contribute to the total of over 1,400. All 200 pizzas were eaten.
The event was particularly noteworthy due to the close coordination between Vatistas’ office and organizations such as the Office of Student Life, the College Events Board, and DAPA. These groups publicized the tailgate in advance and had representatives present. For the marketing staff, such communication represented another important way to boost student involvement.
“We’ve all kind of joined forces and did this tailgate, which is not something we do too frequently,” Vatistas said. “But we’re really excited about this event in particular. For me, the best way to [attract students] is to work with other student groups and work with other people across campus.”
Perhaps the marketing initiative most visible to students has been this fall’s launch of the Crimzone Rewards app. Students create a mobile profile and then wirelessly “check in” to various home sporting events, earning points that can be used to enter a grand prize drawing.
The idea to create the app picked up steam over the summer, when the marketing department opted to replace the HUID swipe system of checking into games with the wireless app. A third-party company built the program, which debuted early in the fall.
According to Vatistas, over 1,300 students are currently registered with the app, which also allows the athletic department to acquire a mass of student emails not ordinarily provided by the University.
The marketing manager has witnessed firsthand the evolution of the initiative to increase student involvement.
“We started our student rewards program about four years ago, when I was an intern,” Vatistas said. “It started with filling out a sheet of paper every time you came to a game. We added it up and put it all into a raffle and picked one…. This past summer we decided to go toward the app with a check-in basis. We wanted to try something new and innovative.”
In addition to coordinating events and mechanisms to boost attendance, the marketing department is also responsible for weekly promotions. For instance, the Holy Cross opener represented Harvard Night, when faculty, staff, and graduate students received free admission. Later promotions included Community Day, giving free tickets for Cambridge, Allston, and Brighton residents and discounted tickets for police, fire, and military personnel.
Long before a single ticket is sold, any marketing events commence, or a Crimson-helmeted player takes the field, the events crew must ensure that the logistics of the game will progress smoothly.
“Depending on the start of the game, we’ll arrive four to five hours before that, and we’ll get in really while no one else is in the facility,” said Caitlyn Young, assistant director of athletics. “It’s really just double checking everything is ready to go, that there are no problems.”
Young’s team will arrive before 9 a.m. for a 1 p.m. start time, splitting up its long list of tasks—checking both the home and visiting teams’ locker rooms to make sure everything is set up, doing a test drive of the scoreboard, putting up the three flags, and testing the various microphones.
If everything goes smoothly, the group can breathe a sigh of relief with hours to spare, killing time until people start rolling in.
The crew welcomes the officials—scheduled months in advance—along with the chain crew, security officials, and the visiting team, directing all of the moving parts to their appropriate places in anticipation of the game.
But if things don’t go as planned—for instance, before the Columbia game on Nov. 8, when the scoreboard refused to cooperate—those four hours come in handy, and it’s up to the events crew to troubleshoot and make sure everything is ready by game time. Prior to the Columbia contest, Young eventually got ahold of an electrician to walk her team through the steps to fix the scoreboard, and a crisis was averted.
Besides running the game itself, the events crew is responsible for the surrounding affairs such as pregame tailgates and receptions, and postgame gatherings. Young often works with the Harvard Alumni Association, typically having to navigate a cluttered calendar. Since there are other athletic events occurring simultaneously with football, the job of the events crew is a weekly juggling act.
“It gets challenging when you have the crossovers in seasons,” Young said. “Right now we’re finishing up the fall, but we’re also starting, full swing now, into the winter. We just happen to have some of the biggest events at those times…. Just being prepared to shuffle people around and have the necessary facilities ready and staff ready, it gets difficult.”
The toughest juggling act—for arguably all departments of Harvard Athletics—comes during the third Saturday of November with the Harvard-Yale football weekend. But Young tries to think of The Game as simply another football contest, just with a significantly larger crowd.
“There’re a lot more hands in the pie just trying to make sure things get done,” Young said. “[But] we’ve done this four times so far this season, so from a gameday standpoint and the protocols we go through and what’s going to be happening on the field, it’s really the same that’s been happening all season.”
Preparation each game may start just days in advance, but preparation of the field occurs months before kickoff. The field is kept pristine year-round, a bubble put over it in the winter to preserve the playing conditions.
With use by the men’s and women’s lacrosse teams in the spring, and outside groups—like the FXFL’s Boston Brawlers—occupying it during football’s off days in the fall, the field must be well prepared to deal with the year-round wear-and-tear.
During any given football week, the preparation will start days in advance, according to facilities manager Jason Waldron. The field is vacuumed and the stands are cleaned. Utilities are checked to determine whether anything is broken and needs to be fixed. The facilities group’s efforts are crucial in making the field presentable come game day.
“Once a week we’ll come and groom the field,” Waldron said. “The purpose of that is to disperse the infill…. Also, for aesthetic purposes, it kind of looks like a freshly mowed cut.”
The preparation is not the same every week, however. Waldron and his crew will prepare differently on Thursday and Friday if the Saturday forecast calls for rain—as it did against Cornell on Oct. 11— or, as is possible in chilly Cambridge Novembers, if it calls for snow.
“We’ll have more guys on the field during a rain day, just keeping an eye on the field and making sure it’s draining properly,” Waldron said. “If it’s puddling up in an area, then we know that maybe that specific spot needs to be addressed.”
On the day of the game, the group will hand over the reins to a grounds crew that it has contracted from Cambridge Landscape for over 30 years. There are typically five grounds crew members for a given event, with two or three custodians in the stadium and another couple remaining around the grounds in case of emergency.
The grounds crew will arrive six hours before kickoff, making sure that the pylons are set, the turf is firm, and all the yardage markers have been drawn. Waldron himself will arrive in the early morning for an afternoon game, setting the standard for the group.
“Our goal is that when a crowd comes in, they’re coming into a well-kept, safe facility,” Waldron said. “You need to come in early to make sure that’s the case.”
When the final whistle blows, after the teams leave the field and the fans file out of the stadium, the day is far from over for the Harvard Office of Athletic Communications.
 During the game, communications handles social media, updates live statistics online, distributes stat sheets to the media throughout the day, and makes sure operations run smoothly in the press box. Such duties range from carrying food for the media up to the top of the elevator-less Harvard Stadium to laying out game notes and rosters for each media member.
Gone are big statistics monitors in the press box of years past. One of the major upgrades made this year was to the live stats website, PrestoSports, which was revamped to take on a more user-friendly interface.
“People run out of space,” said Tim Williamson, the Director of Athletic Communications. “That’s one of the areas where we are setting up a lot of equipment. It takes a lot of time to do that, and we don’t need to do that.”
As the game wraps up in the fourth quarter, a staff member from communications leaves the press box for the third floor of the Murr Center to ready the lounge for the postgame press conference.
And communications still isn’t done after bringing in players and coaches for the media to question and managing the press conference. In addition to posting its own release to the GoCrimson website, at least one member of the department remains in the Murr Lounge to field any final questions from reporters.
“If we have a seven o’clock game and it’s on TV, we probably aren’t leaving here until 12:30 or 1,” said Alli Miller, the secondary media contact for football. “We’re always the last one out, so if a media member is still writing their story, we stay until they’re done, and then we lock up and close down.”
Preparation for a game begins long before Saturday for communications. The department is responsible for distributing credentials earlier in the week to media, the opponent, and any NFL scouts who will be in attendance. The group creates game notes with statistics from the past week and a scouting report on the opposing team. The day before the game—usually Friday—a few people head up to the press box to distribute the game notes and test out the live statistics software.
Further into the football season, things get a bit more chaotic in the communications world, and as with all other departments, this culminates during Harvard-Yale weekend. Preparation begins over a week before The Game. The communications office bustles with action, as members of the press start flowing in and out of the Murr Lounge to do pregame interviews, and an abundance of press credentials are printed for the biggest game of the year.
“For a day like that, it is basically all hands on deck,” Williamson said.
With all the various cogs every game day, it would be easy for the department to get bogged down in box scores, press conferences, and live stat software malfunctions. But for Miller, the greater experience of the communications team makes the job worth it.
“Especially here at Harvard, we have the greatest student-athletes that I’ve ever been around in the country,” Miller said. “I really like getting to know them and getting to know their stories and forming bonds with them and sharing their stories with other people. When it comes down to it, that is my job.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s hockey team hosted Dartmouth in its season opener, junior goaltender Steve Michalek allowed the Big Green to push three goals past him on 37 shots, as the Crimson skated to a 3-3 tie on home ice.
When Harvard traveled to Hanover this time around, Michalek made sure that Dartmouth didn’t have such luck again.
Facing 29 shots from the Big Green, the junior did not allow a single goal in the teams’ second matchup of the year, pitching a shutout as the Crimson bounced back from a close loss to archrival Yale over the weekend to emerge victorious in Thompson Arena, 2-0.
“We didn’t play our best,” junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo said. “But it’s huge to come away with a win. It’s not easy to play in back-to-back very low scoring games, but I think it is telling that we were able to buckle down in the defensive zone.”
As was the case in the first matchup of the year, McNally provided the offensive spark that propelled Harvard (4-1-2, 3-1-2 ECAC). Sophomore Alexander Kerfoot received a pass from Criscuolo off a neutral zone turnover and left a drop pass for McNally, who fired it into the back of the net less than eleven minutes into the first period to give the Crimson a 1-0 lead.
McNally’s three goals on the season have all come against the Big Green (2-3-1, 2-3-1 ECAC). Tuesday’s goal, unlike his two that led to a 3-3 tie in the opener, proved to be the game winner.
With his assist, Criscuolo now has scored a point in all seven games this year. Both he and McNally have nine points on the season.
While Big Green goaltender James Kruger stopped 22 of 23 shots on the night, it was not enough against a strong Crimson defense, as Michalek shut down the Dartmouth attack on the night. Tuesday evening’s contest marks the first time that Harvard has pitched a shutout in Hanover since 1953. Michalek leads the ECAC in save percentage through the early portion of the season with a rate of .949.
“I think it was a good team effort, especially defensively,” junior defenseman Patrick McNally said. “We bore down and held onto the one-goal lead through the second and third [periods].”
While Harvard did not convert any of its four power play opportunities on the night, the team did remain perfect on the year for penalty kills, fending off five Dartmouth chances while a man-up. After an interference call on junior Brayden Jaw gave the Big Green a man advantage with less than five minutes to play, Kerfoot and junior defenseman Max Everson blocked a combined three shots on the penalty kill to preserve the 1-0 lead. The defense has not surrendered a goal in the 26 instances that the team has been a man down.
“Special teams are enormous in ECAC because games are usually so tight,” Criscuolo said. “Being able to kill penalties has allowed us to keep leads and not give them momentum when we take a penalty.”
Junior forward Jimmy Vesey buried an empty-netter in the waning seconds of the game from the defensive zone to secure the win for Harvard. The goal marks his sixth of the year and is only one shy of conference leader Sam Anas of Quinnipiac.
The win moves Harvard into a tie for first in the ECAC standings with Quinnipiac and Rensselaer.
“It’s good to get off to a good start,” McNally said. “But it doesn’t mean anything if we don’t keep it going.”

Undergraduate Council Voting Season is upon us! If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the plethora of posters that have suddenly appeared on every possible surface, or you are still trying to digest what happened at Crimson Crossfire, have no fear: we’ve got you covered. Keep reading for an overview of the tickets and their platforms. Remember that the outcome of this election lies with you. So vote! But do it before noon this Thursday, November 20, or it won’t count.
Heine and Turban 
As this year’s sole sophomore ticket, Luke R. Heine ’17 and Stephen A. Turban ’17 are already making a splash (literally: they brought a pool to the Science Center Plaza). During Crimson Crossfire, they handed out crayons and coloring sheets. They also received press for replacing dining hall newsletters with their watermarked campaign messages in an impressive 11 out of 13 dining halls. Their campaign platform is a little vague: shifting the focus of the UC from parliamentary procedures to the students of Harvard. All in all, the pair aims to increase diversity and “level the playing field” of Harvard; one of their primary goals is to push for the UC to resume funding alcohol for student groups.
Kanuparthy and Horvath
Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 and Ema H. Horvath ’16 are quite a team: while Kanuparthy has served as UC historian, secretary, and is currently treasurer, this is Horvath’s first run in the UC—she is primarily an actor. However, the duo argues that if elected, they will bring a fresh pair of eyes to the Council. Their platform consists of four “deliverables”: guaranteed summer storage in Houses, the opportunity to influence how Houses are renewed, better funding for new or smaller student groups, and increased social space in the Smith Campus Center.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal
Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 are seasoned campaigners known for their polished presentation. Their platform centers around the color purple, infographics, and the four F’s: funding, food, freshmen, and fear of missing out (FOMO). Overall, the pair hopes to make the UC more accessible to students, advocating for “A UC That Begins With U.” Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal both draw from previous experience on the UC (for Nasrollahzadeh, it’s serving as Student Relations Chair; for Goyal, it’s serving on the finance and education committees) as proof that they can get things done. Check out their spiffy website for more information.
Yang and Jackson
If you’ve seen a pair of Wonder Women dancing around to Pharrell’s “Happy” recently, you’ve probably seen Happy Yang ’16 and Faith A. Jackson ’16, whose campaign slogan “Be Happy and Have Faith” describes their overarching goals: to support student happiness and mental health on campus, and to restore faith in the effectiveness of the UC. Their website lists their main initiatives: the creation of inclusive social spaces, namely in one in the Smith Campus Center; more student input in the campus sexual assault policy; and a UC that’s more responsive to the student body.
And there you have it! A brief rundown of who’s who and what’s what. Now go vote!
