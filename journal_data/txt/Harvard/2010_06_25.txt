After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The days leading up to Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan’s Senate confirmation hearings have been marked by increased public scrutiny of the former Harvard Law School dean’s position on military recruiting at the school.
Last weekend, the Department of Defense released about 850 pages of documents indicating that Kagan did not prevent military recruiting at the Law School during her tenure as dean, although she barred recruiters from conducting interviews through the school’s career center.
The current controversy among federal lawmakers is whether military recruiters were banned from recruiting at the Law School during the spring of 2005. Kagan temporarily banned the military from using the Law School’s Office of Career Services facilities, arguing that the "Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell" policy—which openly bans those who are openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual from serving in the military—did not align with the school’s non-discrimination policy.
"I believe the military’s discriminatory employment policy is deeply wrong— both unwise and unjust," Kagan wrote in a September 2005 letter to the Law School community, voicing her opposition to the policy. "And this wrong tears at the fabric of our own community by denying an opportunity to some of our students that other of our students have."
But a recently uncovered e-mail indicates that although recruiters were barred from OCS services and facilities, they were not prevented from independently recruiting on campus. The message detailed a number of campus recruitment opportunities, including the United States Army Judge Advocate General's Corps interviews for summer internships and "full-time active duty positions."
In addition, a spring 2005 letter penned by the Harvard Law School Veterans Association following Kagan’s ban on military recruiters’ access to OCS services stated that Kagan asked the association to “facilitate some measure of interested student access to military representatives” to compensate for any inconveniences caused by the policy decision. The HLSVA complied by setting up an e-mail address for interested students to send confidential inquiries.
Although Kagan did not ban military recruiters, her critics claim that she created inadequate access to recruiting services for students interested in joining the military. In the same letter sent in spring 2005, the HLSVA conceded that the e-mail address “falls short” of duplicating the services of OCS, suggesting that Kagan’s restrictions complicated military recruitment for interested students.
Despite her opposition to "Don't Ask, Don't Tell," Kagan maintained an exception to the school's non-discrimination policy that allowed the military to recruit through the OCS as they had done since 2002, before she assumed the deanship.
But in spring 2005, Kagan eliminated that exception in response to a Third Circuit Court decision that ruled as unconstitutional the Solomon Amendment, which grants the military agency to cut funding to a university that "prohibits, or in effect prevents" military recruiting. Kagan reinstated the exception only a few months later under pressure from the Department of Defense, which threatened to cut funding to the University.
Kagan, who clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall and previously served as Solicitor General, was nominated to replace Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama on May 10. Kagan, 50, would be the youngest Justice on the Court, and the first Justice since William H. Rehnquist without prior judicial experience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An independent committee report reviewing the controversial arrest of Professor Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr. to offer "lessons learned" will be released next week, the Cambridge Police Department said today.
As recent as last week, the CPD said that it was unaware of any release date of the report, but CPD spokesman Daniel M. Riviello said this morning that the report will be presented at a press conference in the middle of next week.
The Cambridge Review Committee, a group of 12 academics and law enforcement personnel, was formed last September to generate recommendations regarding police training, department procedures, and the role of race and class in policing—particularly significant given the nationwide accusations of racial bias on the part of the CPD in the July 16 arrest of Gates, who is African-American.
In a March 1 "progress report," the committee said that a final report would be issued in the late spring. Earlier this month, the Cambridge Chronicle reported that it would be submitted to the city last week.
The Cambridge Review Committee’s report will come on the heels of an analysis by the police department that absolved it of any systematic racial bias in its application of the disorderly conduct charge. The analysis found that between 2004 and 2008, 31.2 percent of individuals arrested for disorderly conduct—the charge that prompted Gates’ arrest—were black, which was under the national average of 34.9 percent.
The CPD also said that the racial makeup of alleged perpetrators of disorderly conduct when the arresting officer was white—64 percent white and 30 percent black—closely mirrored the distribution when the arresting officer was black—65 percent white and 30 percent black.
A report from the New England Center for Investigative Reporting—initiated in light of Gates' arrest—produced similar findings, stating that the racial breakdown of arrests for disorderly conduct closely mirrored the racial composition of individuals investigated for disorderly conduct.
The discussion of racial bias in policing gained momentum after Gates was arrested for disorderly conduct at his home last summer, an event that sparked criticism of the Cambridge Police Department and allegations of racial prejudice. Charges were dropped against Gates on July 21.

TD Bank opened a new location today on 1270 Mass. Ave. as part of a recent corporate initiative to expand in the Greater Boston area, celebrating with a display of balloons and pom-poms in the company's colors of green and white.
Located off of Plympton St. in the space that had been occupied by the Adidas store until December, the new TD Bank branch will be open seven days a week and will also offer free online banking and bill pay, according to spokesperson Jimmy A. Hernandez.
TD Bank, one of the 15 largest banks in the United States, serves customers from Maine to Florida and has 31 locations in Middlesex County alone.
The new branch will not focus on competition with the other banks in the Square, but will concentrate on delivering TD Bank's touted "WOW!" customer service, Hernandez said.
Hernandez said that lollipops and biscuits will be given to children and dogs who enter the store. In a corner of the store, a coin-counting green and purple machine called the Penny Arcade provided a platform for kids to deposit their coins and have them counted by a cartoon character named Penny free of charge.
On the wall adjacent to the Penny Arcade, a mural of Harvard Square in 1928 covers the surface from floor to ceiling.
"This ties us  to the community," said Marion Colombo, senior vice president of retail  banking.
The official grand opening of the new TD Bank will take place in the fall, when Harvard students return to campus and can "be included in the festivities," Hernandez said.
