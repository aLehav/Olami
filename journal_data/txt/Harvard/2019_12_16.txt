After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow and a representative from the island of Antigua and Barbuda are discussing educational partnerships after the country’s prime minister sent a letter to Bacow requesting reparations for the school’s ties to slavery.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an email to The Crimson Friday that Bacow and Antigua and Barbuda’s United States Ambassador Sir Ronald M. Sanders recently spoke and agreed to another conversation about future academic collaboration.
“I can confirm that there was a call between President Bacow and Ambassador Sanders, and that they agreed to a follow up discussion on how Harvard and the University of the West Indies might collaborate in ways consistent with our academic mission,” Newton wrote.
Reparations to Antigua and Barbuda were not part of the discussion, according to a report from the Miami Herald. In late October, Antigua and Barbuda's prime minister, Gaston A. Browne, wrote a letter to Bacow demanding reparations for the school’s historical ties to slavery.
“Reparation from Harvard would compensate for its development on the backs of our people,” Browne wrote. “Reparation is not aid; it is not a gift; it is compensation to correct the injustices of the past and restore equity. Harvard should be in the forefront of this effort.”
Bacow announced a new University-wide initiative last month to research the schools’s historical ties to slavery. Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Dean Tomiko Brown-Nagin will serve as the head of the initiative’s faculty committee.
The research initiative comes roughly a month after Bacow apologized for using the 13th Amendment as an analogy to compare the University’s wealthy donors to slaves at an Alumni Affairs and Development staff meeting.
The Oct. 30 letter from Browne details how Isaac Royall Jr., a plantation owner and slave trader who operated in Antigua, donated money to Harvard in 1815 to create the first endowed law professorship. Royall Jr.’s family crest became the seal of Harvard Law School in 1937.
In 2016, Harvard Law School removed its seal following research that revealed its ties to slavery. The seal featured three sheaves of wheat and adorned the school’s doors, chairs, apparel, letterheads, web pages, social media avatars, and the banners that typically served as the backdrop to each graduating class’ commencement ceremony.
The Law School replaced the Royall crests with a crimson seal with “Harvard Law” written across the front in the spring of 2016.
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 announced a working group to develop a new seal in an email to students in late November.
“As many of you know, HLS retired its former shield in 2016 after historical research revealed that Isaac Royall, Jr., on whose family crest the shield was based following a bequest to Harvard College in 1781, earned his wealth through the labor of enslaved people,” Manning wrote. “Working in conjunction with the University and the Harvard Corporation, we will move forward with the proposal of a new shield that fits within Harvard’s suite of shields and that represents the broad aspirations of Harvard Law School.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Twenty four faculty members at the Harvard School of Public Health have signed onto a letter in support of negotiations between Harvard’s striking graduate student union and the University.
The letter — which is addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran — calls on Harvard to return “swiftly” to the bargaining table with Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers.
School of Public Health Professor Nancy Krieger, who signed the letter, wrote in an email that the professors first sent it Tuesday.
“There can be no bargaining in good faith if no bargaining sessions are scheduled,” the letter reads. “We support the right of HGSU-UAW to bargain in good faith for the interests of our graduate students, and we urge Harvard University to bargain in good faith in return.”
Since the letter's release, the University has scheduled a bargaining session with HGSU negotiators for Dec. 18 — though union organizers called the newly scheduled three-hour session “inadequate” in an email update sent to members Wednesday.
HGSU, which boasts roughly 4,000 members, represents graduate and undergraduate teaching staff and graduate research assistants across the University. The union began its strike Dec. 3 — 13 months into negotiations over its first contract — and will continue striking indefinitely.
School of Public Health Professor Marc Lipsitch, who also signed the letter, said he thought faculty who support their students’ efforts should see the grievances raised by the students as legitimate.
“Striking is just a complicated interaction with an academic environment,” Lipsitch said. “So I think a number of us would like to be as supportive as we can while still trying to keep education and research continuing.”
When asked why she signed the letter, Mary T. Bassett, who directs the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, referenced Article 23 of the United Nation’s Declaration of Human Rights, which grants the right to unionize.
“The graduate students, as workers, have exercised these rights and, of course, I support their right to do so,” Bassett wrote in an email . “The letter called for resumption of scheduled meetings and I am pleased that a face to face negotiation session between the union and the University has been scheduled for this coming week.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain pointed to the upcoming bargaining session when asked for comment.
So far, the two parties have agreed on 12 tentative contract provisions. But when negotiators meet at the Wednesday bargaining session, three key provisions will remain on the table: compensation, health benefits, and grievance procedures for sexual harassment and discrimination.
Krieger wrote in an email that it does not take a position on the specific issues that would be considered in negotiations.
“The letter takes no position on the specific issues for which additional bargaining needs to take place, as that was not the purpose of the letter, which was instead focused on the process needed for there to be bargaining in good faith,” Krieger wrote.
“As concerned faculty, we thought it important to urge the resumption of bargaining in good faith, because we care about our graduate students and our University, as we are part of our University, we teach and work with our graduate students, and we have a stake in the two sides coming to good terms as a result of mutual bargaining in good faith,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Week 14 of the NFL season, hundreds of players across professional football participated in the NFL’s My Cause My Cleats campaign. Participating players wore custom cleats to showcase different causes that are meaningful to them, and the cleats were auctioned online after the games to raise money for their chosen causes. One hundred percent of the proceeds go directly to the charities and organizations. The highest current bid for a My Cause My Cleat item? Tom Brady’s cleats, which support the TB12 Foundation and Best Buddies, are currently sitting at $20,100 at the time of publication.
If you had tuned into the Seattle Seahawks’ game against the Los Angeles Rams this past Sunday, you would have seen Tyler Ott ‘14, Seattle’s long-snapper, in white and purple custom cleats. Ott chose to represent The Second Step, an organization based in Newton, MA that is devoted to raising awareness of domestic violence and providing support, housing, and critical services to people affected by domestic violence and their families. The cleats were designed by local artist Julieanne Strom Brill.
Tyler and his wife Ashley Ott ‘11, a former women’s ice hockey player, live in Milton, MA are both Harvard graduates, with Tyler concentrating in economics and Ashley in psychology. Both lived in Dunster house. Ashley played forward for the women’s ice hockey team while Tyler played long snapper and tight end for Harvard before he graduated and moved on to the NFL.
From 2014 to 2016, Tyler had stints with the Patriots, Giants, Rams, and Bengals organizations before getting a phone call from the Seahawks on January 1, 2017 after their snapper was injured during their last regular season game. He was signed before the Seahawks’ first postseason game against the Lions that year and has stayed with the team ever since.
Before the beginning of the 2019 NFL season, the Seahawks offered Ott a three-year extension to his one-year deal for 2019, taking his contract through the 2022 season. The deal, worth about $4 million, marks the first time Ott has received a contract longer than a single year, giving him and Ashley some well-earned and welcomed stability. This has allowed Ashley, a partner at Vantage Point Financial, to open up a Seattle branch office for her company, giving her the flexibility to work on each coast.
The couple originally got involved in The Second Step after attending a book launch for No More Secrets by A Sisterhood of Survivors, the story of six women’s participation in a healing group with The Second Step. Ashley was inspired and joined several committees to learn more about The Second Step, and was then asked to become a board member.
“I’ve been a board member for over a year now and have enjoyed helping The Second Step evolve,” said Ashley. “The work and the passion of those that work for The Second Step should be emulated by other organizations, and I believe [it’s] something that can be a model for other domestic violence no-profits.”
“Like Ashley said, it’s a powerful organization and I think they approach the subject different than most,” Tyler shared. “When these women share their survival stories they show others the ‘greener side of the grass’ and that they too can get out of abusive relationships. They also show the world that anyone, from all backgrounds and upbringings, can be in abusive relationships.”
Ashley reflected on her experience listening to a keynote speaker at The Second Step’s Celebrating Success Gala last year, who shared her story of domestic abuse and recovery.
“She looked like me, had a similar upbringing in a suburb of MA, and ended up in a relationship where she was abused physically and verbally. It just reminded me again, that it could happen to anyone, and it does. Domestic violence is unfortunately extremely prevalent and many victims need the help and support that The Second Step provides. This is why it’s so important to spread the message of the great work they do.”
The couple’s involvement with The Second Step and support for its message and programs is why they chose to use their platform to bring more awareness to the organization and to the growing issue of domestic violence. The NFL’s My Cause My Cleats campaign provided the perfect opportunity to do so, giving Tyler the chance to wear his custom cleats to support the cause.
“The NFL has made headlines in the wrong ways regarding domestic violence in the past few years. It’s a big stage with a lot of viewers and influence,” Tyler said. “Hopefully dedicating my cleats to The Second Step sheds some light on the issue of domestic violence, the resources available for victims, and how we all can help.”
The game against the Rams was broadcast on primetime national television during Sunday Night Football, and despite the Seahawks’ loss, the exposure for a good cause was a win.
