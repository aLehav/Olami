The Russian-born Eva Lanska has worn many artistic hats in her journey to become an award-winning director. The multi-hyphenate has a background in journalism, has written five novels, and even had a brief career as a singer and released her own album. But now, she’s finally doing what she loves most, and has received directing awards at film festivals around the world. The Harvard Crimson sat down with Lanska at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival to discuss her path to directing, advice for young filmmakers, and what it takes to succeed as a woman in a notoriously difficult industry.
The Harvard Crimson: You’ve got a diverse artistic background in writing, music, and film. What led you to land on film?\
Eva Lanska: I’ve always wanted to be a filmmaker. It’s my personality, my second skin. I can’t even imagine life without it. When I was five years old, my mother remembers very well I would stage plays with toy dolls and animals. I had already started to imagine my script.
THC: Do you think that your writing background makes you a better director?
EL: Writing is what really made me, what defined my style. That background is extremely helpful.
THC: Did you have any mentors in the industry as you were shifting to directing?
EL: Not really. I don’t copy anyone. It’s difficult to find yourself and be yourself, but that’s what being an artist means to me. I try to separate my thinking, my ideas, from everything else. I think it’s important for artists to have this filter.
Of course, I do have some directors I appreciate. I love Italian films; Michelangelo Antonioni is one of my favorite directors. Sometimes, before shooting, I’ll go and watch a few scenes from one of his movies that I know by heart.
THC: When you were a kid, did you think that you could become a filmmaker? Or did that seem too difficult or too far away?
EL: Honestly, nothing is too difficult. I was always a hundred percent sure of everything I was doing. When you have a dream, you have to treat it like a one way ticket — don’t buy a ticket to go back.
THC: Do you have advice for younger filmmakers?
EL: Many people, when they start they say — I’m not good enough, they make mistakes. This is a job without concrete, solid guarantees. But you have to follow your instincts anyway.
You also really have to work hard. When I was a little girl, I would train myself — even if I wanted to go out or hang out with my friends, I would choose to work instead. Sometimes, you have to choose between fun and your career. The film business is not an easy one. Everybody knows each other, and to be accepted into that circle, you really have to work hard.
The biggest advice that I have is whenever possible, don’t accept a closed door. If the door is not open, you knock again and again until you’re able to sit down with that person and get an interview or have a conversation.
Another thing that’s very important to me is allowing audiences to make up their own minds. I give the information, show the possibilities, and give audiences a chance to take a seat. But I don’t give concrete final decisions to people. Our job is to help people make up their own minds, to make them think.
THC: What’s the biggest challenge you’ve faced as a director?
EL: You know the low proportion of women directing films. It’s a very serious problem. If I ask you how many female filmmakers you know in Russia, you’re gonna give me one or two names. And the amount of film directors who receive big budgets is close to none.
As women, we need to put our power together. We can’t keep competing with each other; it’s not going to help. And we’re also going to need outside support, maybe even from the government, to support women’s projects. We already trust men; we need to give women that same trust.
THC: What do you think it takes to be successful in this industry as a woman?
EL: First of all, discipline. Second, to be flexible. And honestly, to be professional. Keeping your emotions to yourself. Most importantly, never sacrifice your soul or your body.

What does it mean to “stigmatize” mental illness? Writers and directors often struggle to find a balance between honesty and hope, to avoid either glossing over the reality of mental health disorders or portraying those diagnosed with them as “broken” or a burden to others.
It’s a hard line to walk, and — particularly for more severe illnesses that have a high death rate — there are serious consequences when done wrong.
“Les Intranquilles” is a film that aims to walk that difficult line as it tackles one of the most deadly and complicated mental illnesses: bipolar disorder. It follows married couple Leïla (Leïla Bekhti) and Damien (Damien Bonnard) and their young son Amine (Gabriel Merz Chammah) as the family grapples with Damien’s severe bipolar disorder. Damien is in the midst of an escalating manic episode for much of the movie, and director Joachim Lafosse depicts both the episode itself and its consequences on Damien’s family with brutal, vivid detail. The exhausted Leïla struggles to convince Damien to take his medication and protect Amine from the worst of his father’s mood swings; meanwhile, Amine is caught between them as the parents get into heated arguments about what is best for Damien and their family.
The film remains focused on i​​ts small and tight-knit cast, grounded by a fiery, indomitable performance from Bekhti. Lafosse originally imagined Bekhti as a character “subjugated by her husband’s psychosis,” but Bekhti chose to push the character more towards strength and firmness. As a result, Bekhti portrays Leïla as a woman with a deep love for her family but strong boundaries as well: someone who wants the time and space to take care of herself, and not just endlessly tend to others. That strength elevates Leïla from a beleaguered victim into something far more complicated and compelling, reminding audiences that you can love someone deeply and still say no to them.
Another of the film’s strong suits is its moments of levity. Though few and far between, tender scenes of the couple dancing together or singing along in the car are crucial in giving the film’s characters a depth beyond their experiences with mental illness. Much of this laughter and joy is punctuated by a fantastic score from Antoine Bodson and the acclaimed Olafur Arnalds, who weave moments of heavy drums and high-energy into a film that can otherwise be emotionally bleak. Aided by these moments of lightness and humanity, Lafosse effectively creates an incredibly touching, tender story about what we are willing to sacrifice for our loved ones.
However, “Les Intranquilles” does not position itself as a drama that’s just about a family going through a hard time. Several of the film’s climactic scenes clearly make larger statements about “bipolarity” itself, and repeat, with very pessimistic undertones, that “bipolarity can’t be cured.” Frustratingly, there is no recognition of the fact that “bipolarity” can encompass a large and complex range of experiences with extremely varied degrees of severity. There are at least four different types of bipolar — Damien appears to present Bipolar I, arguably the most extreme of the 4. Many people with Bipolar II do not experience intense manic episodes in the way that Damien does, and Damien’s case is also uniquely severe in the frequency of his episodes.
To lump “bipolarity” into one large, “incurable,” doomed category in the way that “Les Intranquilles” does wrongly paint those with the disorder as unilaterally hopeless cases. This message is both inaccurate — many with the disorder respond very well to treatment and are able to live healthy, stable lives — and seriously dangerous for a disease with a tragically high rate of suicide. There is certainly value in honest portrayals of the way bipolar disorder can affect a person’s family and friends; however, to do so in a way that equates one experience with “bipolarity” itself arguably only furthers the very “stigma” that thoughtful representations of mental illness are meant to break.

Sean Baker tells stories with the painstaking care of a documentarian. His previous award-winning films have followed the child of a struggling single mother living on the edge of Disney World ("The Florida Project") and the ups and downs of two trans women employed as sex workers in LA (“Tangerine”). Baker fully immerses viewers into his subjects’ everyday lives to the point that you feel like you’re a part of them, and he brings that same level of research and immersion to “Red Rocket” — the story of a broke, aging porn star who returns to his small Texas town.
Baker’s protagonist Mikey Saber (Simon Rex) used to have a dream life — or so he loves to tell anyone who will listen. He won an award at “the Oscars of adult entertainment” three times, and had a once-glamorous marriage with fellow porn star Lexi (Bree Elrod). But the industry has used him and spit him out, and when we first meet him in “Red Rocket,” he’s outside his estranged wife’s door begging for a place to stay so he doesn’t sleep on the street. Lexi reluctantly lets him back into her life and begins to harbor hope that they might reignite their marriage. Meanwhile, Mikey is off seducing underage high school donut-shop employee Strawberry (Suzanna Son), hoping to lure her into the porn industry and use her as his ticket back in.
Amid all of Mikey’s ill-advised schemes and many moral failures, Simon Rex manages to humanize the character in a gritty, earnest, vulnerable performance that should be considered a serious contender for Best Actor. Rex has a certain magnetic quality and boyish charm that draws you to Mikey, even if you know he’s a scumbag. He’s also a former porn star himself, and brings an authenticity and nuance to the performance — most noticeable in the details of his physicality and his unusually-high comfort with his body — that likely wouldn’t have been present with a conventional Hollywood leading man.
In capturing the emptied-out Texas town that forms the backdrop for “Red Rocket,” Baker also strives for total authenticity. We see this with the film's attention to detail: from a small group of people walking past a giant, smoggy factory looming in the background, to the factory workers' donut orders or the amount of weed they buy, we are given small but consistent hints at the hopelessness felt by the factory workers. More often than not, a Fox News anchor’s disembodied voice can be heard in the background — just to complete the image.
However, while Baker has brought the experiences and social issues of rural Texans to life, he also fails to engage with them in any meaningful way. There is no commentary on the causes of Trumpism, the impact of those beliefs on the many Black and brown characters that Trump supporters Lexi and her Mom Lil interact with, or the causes for the economic exploitation of the donut-loving factory workers.
But perhaps most insidiously, Mikey’s relationship with Strawberry is irresponsible, unrealistic, and implicitly victim-blaming. No one ever finds out that Mikey has had sex with an underage child and convinced her to film a sex scene (which is a federal crime). Mikey convinces Strawberry to break up with her boyfriend (which escalates into a public confrontation that her entire school hears about) and to drop out of high school, but she never confronts Mikey or expresses concern over his behavior. Advocates for victims of sexual abuse and assault have spent years trying to help the public understand that children cannot give consent, and the vast majority of relationships between older men and underage people are exploitative and dangerous. Against that backdrop, it’s all the more frustrating that the character of Strawberry is written to accommodate everything Mikey wants (for no developed reason), never shows discomfort with his behavior, and every negative consequence she does or will experience as a result of their relationship happens off-screen. Baker may well view their relationship as illegal and exploitative (which it is), but by refusing to pass judgement on it either implicitly or explicitly, he’s both normalizing that kind of behavior and furthering the false idea that young women like Strawberry are “asking for it.”
With his detail-rich portraits of disadvantaged Americans, the New-Jersey born Baker has made a career out of telling stories far removed from his own life. But in “Red Rocket,” he not only fails to leave viewers with any message or encouragement about how to fix the problems he’s portraying, but furthers harmful stereotypes about the vulnerable people who become involved with an industry that’s already extremely stigmatized and misunderstood.

Exactly 30 years ago, Oliver Stone’s original political thriller “JFK” stirred up controversy and public outcry over the dubious circumstances surrounding the assassination of the former president. Though the U.S. government’s Warren Commission charged Lee Harvey Oswald with the murder, many elements about the case shed doubt on the government’s official portrait of Oswald as an individual firebrand who assassinated Kennedy with no outside help. “JFK” not only helped to bring those arguments to light, but made an even bolder accusation — alleging that the plot involved the CIA and even then-Vice President Johnson himself. Due in part to the cultural impact of Stone’s original film, the U.S. government passed the “JFK Act,” pledging to release a wealth of sealed records to the public by 2017. Drawing on those newly-released records as well as James DiEugenio’s 1992 nonfiction book “Destiny Betrayed: JFK, Cuba, and the Garrison Case,” Stone created “JFK Revisited: Through the Looking Glass,” a follow-up documentary that premiered on July 12 at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival.
Where “JFK” was a fictionalized drama with celebrity stars, “JFK Revisited” feels more like an academic lecture, guiding viewers through a slew of artifacts and witness statements with painstaking detail. The first half is primarily focused on refuting the “single bullet theory” agreed on by the Warren Commission — namely, that a single bullet managed to hit both President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connelly and inflict several separate wounds. On this point, Stone more than proves his case, uncovering never-before-seen interviews with witnesses, surgeons who examined Kennedy, and forensic photographers who all alleged that they were forced into silence by CIA officials. Stone also interviewed a host of “Kennedy experts” who have made entire careers out of studying the case, and it’s difficult to argue with the weight of their research. The pace does drag at times (and the refutation of the single-bullet theory, in particular, seems unnecessarily belabored), but as a case for doubting the Warren Commission’s official story, “JFK Revisited” does a compelling job.
However, Stone devotes far less time to the pressing question that has remained unanswered for decades: Who really killed Kennedy? Though Stone’s original dramatization put New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw on trial, Stone does not seem to have found any more potential culprits in the years since “JFK.” He continues to suggest, as “JFK” did, that the CIA (namely former-director Allen Dulles, who Kennedy ousted) and even President Johnson were involved or at least aware of the assassination plot, but he provides more motive than evidence to support those serious claims.
“JFK Revisited” is a part-gripping, part-didactic watch that makes a strong case that the murder of President Kennedy is still very much unsolved. However, despite presenting new evidence, Stone’s latest still does not give audiences much in the way of an answer to the all-important question of what really happened at that fateful motorcade. What it does do, then, is leave a myriad of questions in viewers' minds — and hopefully encourage them to keep asking those questions on their own.

Hungarian Director Ildikó Enyedi is fascinated by the idea of control. Or, specifically, the human desire for control over the ones we love — and the consequences of taking that desire too far. Her in-competition entry “The Story of My Wife” attempts to explore those themes, adapting the 1942 Hungarian novel of the same name following a man’s ill-fated attempts to control his mysterious wife.
In one of “The Story of My Wife”’s first scenes, Captain Jakob Störr (Gijs Naber) takes a bet that he will marry the first woman that walks into a cafe. Luckily (or ultimately unluckily) for him, that woman is the charming and elusive Lizzy, played by an enchanting Léa Seydoux. Störr is dazzled by Lizzy’s aloof, witty banter and marries her almost immediately; the majority of the film then follows his frustrated attempts to verify his intuition that she is cheating on him.
Set in the roaring 20s, the film’s elaborate set pieces, gorgeous costumes, and sense of flapper-girl flair bring its romantic setting to rich life. The charismatic Lizzy is always impeccably dressed, and the film is full of lavish, sparkling parties that are a visual feast for the viewer. Excellent cinematography from Marcell Rév also adds to the film’s sense of elegance; in one scene of Lizzy and Jakob dancing, Rév’s camera creates a dance in and of itself. The camera’s eye traces Lizzy’s neck as she dips, zooms in on her hands against a gleaming sunset, and keeps the pair in frame against a blurry mass of other bodies.
Unfortunately, “The Story of My Wife” has little substance beyond its glittery sheen, and its meandering message on love, relationships, and control is at best unclear and at worst self-contradictory. Lizzy and Jakob have a confusing and largely loveless relationship, not particularly unsurprising for two people who married after just meeting each other. Lizzy remains frosty and impenetrable, and her lack of discernible emotions or personality leave her feeling more like a male fantasy than a person. Enyedi told The Hollywood Reporter that this lack of development is intentional: Enyedi wanted to make deliberate use of the male gaze to tell a story about how Störr’s patriarchal worldview makes him unable to understand his wife. But without much of a personality on Lizzy’s part, there can be no real chemistry for the two, and it’s hard to root for a relationship where neither person seems truly happy. Furthermore, the message itself — on letting go of the need to control the other person — seems very undercut by a surprise twist at the film’s end.
In nearly three hours, “The Story of My Wife” gives the audience only one developed character (who’s not particularly compelling), a strange relationship that hardly seems worth saving, and a confused and undercut message on trust and control. For those fascinated by 1920s fashion or long shots of sea captains staring out in the ocean, it might be worth a watch; but for most audiences, there’s not much beneath the film's sparkling surface.

In 2021, a HIV diagnosis is no longer a death sentence. Several decades ago, the disease was able to ravage predominantly LGBTQ victims at will; unconcerned governments did nothing, and many openly admitted to a blatant lack of concern with the lives of queer people dying from the virus. But science has finally found effective treatment, and the biggest modern fight against HIV is against the stigma around it which prevents people seeking treatment, not the virus itself.
“Women Do Cry”’s depiction of a young, ostensibly straight woman with HIV seems jarringly unconcerned with that history. The film follows the journey of 19-year-old Sonja (Maria Bakalova, who starred in "Borat Subsequent Moviefilm") after she learns that her boyfriend is seeing another girl, has been having sex with other men, and has given her HIV. The many women in Sonja’s family all band together in an attempt to force Sonja to accept treatment, and the film uses Sonja’s experience as a lens to examine larger issues of sexism in her native Bulgaria.
The film shines in its moments of intimacy and solidarity between the women of Sonja’s family, and particularly in the relationship between Sonja and her sister Lora (Ralitsa Stoyanova). “Women Do Cry” opens with a scene of the two sisters in an all-out catfight over closet space, and the sisters’ relationship continues to be characterized by bickering and jealousy but bedrocked by an unbreakable, underlying love for one another. That contrast makes “Women Do Cry”’s portrayal of sisterhood all the more realistic and deeply-felt, as the film thoughtfully captures all of the hair-pulling, jealousy, clothes-stealing, and best friendship that comes with having a sister. Scenes of the other women in Sonja’s family like her Mom and aunts aren’t quite as strong as those between Sonja and Lora, but they do touch on a range of important issues like unequal household responsibilities and gendered domestic violence that are often swept under the rug in the directors’ native country.
Unfortunately, woven in with this cocktail of “girl power” is a shocking level of homophobia and transphobia that significantly undercuts the film's attempts at empowerment. The film’s entire premise centers around a portrayal of HIV as a degrading, disgusting, shameful disease, perpetuating without question the very stigmas that led to both underfunding of HIV research in the first place and hesitancy to seek life-saving treatment in the modern day. But not only does Sonja’s extreme hysteria and unwillingness to accept her HIV diagnosis set a poor precedent for modern people with the virus, her disgust is also rooted in continual, explicit homophobia and transphobia that is not countered by a single other character in the film. She “makes herself up like a transvestite,” as her sister Lora remarks in disgust, so that, in Sonja’s words “everyone will know I have AIDS.” The scene implies that it’s a shameful thing to wear garish makeup because of its associations with sex work and trans people, that it’s acceptable to use the term “transvestite” (it’s not), and that being associated with a trans person is an inherently gross and embarrassing thing. There are numerous other homophobic and transphobic stereotypes and slurs that are said without restraint or consequence. Lora encourages Sonja to assume that any bisexual man has HIV, a stereotype that’s both patently false and still directly feeding into outdated rules for blood donors. Sonja’s grandfather is encouraged and praised for being a good patriarch after he goes on a detailed rant on how he’s going to “murder the filthy f***** who killed my daughter.”
Perhaps more egregiously than any of these individual issues, however, is the show’s portrayal of trans man Yoana (played by Vesela Kazakova, who also co-directs the film). Yoana’s portrayal is essentially a checklist of how not to portray a trans character. Yoana’s girlfriend encourages him not to take gender-affirming hormones because she says “I want you as a woman,” and falsely claims the hormones will “stop your emotions.” Yoana does not stand up to this behavior; he says “I am a boy,” but makes the sacrifice not to transition in order to stay with his girlfriend. His family is in no way affirming of his transition, either; after he talks about not wanting to be pregnant due to gender dysphoria, a family member responds with “being a woman is hard.” Yoana receives a sea of laughs when he responds, “You know what’s worse — being a man,” and the film’s tone-deaf and thoughtless attempt at gender solidarity to the exclusion of trans people once again continues unchecked.
Though “Women Do Cry” has its strengths — genuine, intimate moments between female family members, moments of excellent acting from Bakalova and Stoyanova in particular — it shows a blatant disrespect for the LGBT community at every turn. One would think that someone telling a story about HIV would take care to counter stigmas and re-affirm that queer lives and bodies are worth saving. Instead, “Women Do Cry” seems to expect the audience to sympathize and even agree with Sonja’s sense that it is an incredible tragedy to have the disease precisely because it is so associated with LGBT people.

This week, the Cannes Film Festival secretly added a last-minute film to its lineup: “Revolution of Our Times,” a fiery and gripping account of Hong Kong’s 2019 pro-democracy protests. The “surprise documentary,” which was first screened confidentially to a small group of journalists on July 15, follows seven distinct groups made up of student protesters (like the Valiants, a vigilante group of pro-democracy revolutionaries), journalists, and others who have led the way in protesting for a democratic Hong Kong. The protests lead to the arrests of thousands of protesters and pro-democracy advocates, a brutal and violent police crackdown, the murders and suicides of protesters, and much stricter control by the Chinese Communist Party over the once semi-autonomous region.
The film was directed by Kiwi Chow, known mostly for his other politically-charged work, “Ten Years.” Prior to Cannes, the film’s existence was not known. For over two years, Chow worked in secret to film and edit the documentary amid strict censorship laws imposed by Beijing to limit freedom of speech in Hong Kong. Because of these laws, the rest of the film's credits are either incomplete or use pseudonyms to protect those who worked on the documentary. Instead, “Revolution of Our Times” simply says that it is made “By Hongkongers.”
Indeed, the film holds true on its promise to follow individual Hongkongers who rose up amid political crackdowns from Beijing — civilian leaders whom Chow depicts as fearless. Named after the second half of a popular protest slogan — ”Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times" — the film expertly crafts its story around both both the protesters' mission to protect democracy in Hong Kong and also the severe, and at times insurmountable, obstacles of police and state brutality. Chow's film is told exclusively by the people fighting on or working to support the frontlines as they take on an authoritarian police force. By removing his own voice from the story and allowing it to be told by the folks who most directly experienced it, Chow delivers his audience a compelling case for the protesters’ message of liberation.
Steps to maintain privacy, like blurring the faces of the film's subjects, were necessary for the same reasons that these mostly-young people were protesting in the first place. The demonstrations front-and-center in this documentary were catalyzed by a bill proposed in 2019 which would allow people arrested in Hong Kong to be extradited to China. Many worried that their rights as Hong Kong citizens would be infringed, and indeed, the 2020 National Security Law has realized many of these fears. For protestors, including those shown in the film (who all go by pseudonyms like “Conscience” or “Nobody”), such a law has proven especially dangerous; the film even ends with a note that some of the film's own interview subjects have since been arrested. Such elements — from the secrecy of the film's release to the lengths Chow goes to protect its subjects — add a degree of tangible, real-world urgency to its subject.
Chow and his team largely film the documentary with on-the-ground footage; Chow himself spent days and nights with the protesters as they took over the Polytechnic University in Hong Kong in one of their biggest and most impactful protests, which, like all the others, was met by brutal and relentless force from the Hong Kong police. Throughout the film, Chow’s presence is palpable, though it seems he tried to avoid it. But that isn’t a bad thing — the shaky handheld camera, especially in times of extreme chaos, and the way it follows characters like a person’s eye would, all add to a sense of personhood behind the film. In one particularly crucial moment, for example, a protestor breaks the fourth wall by thanking Chow for telling their story.
These two things — the unrelenting humanity of the documentary, and its importance in documenting the struggle for Hong Kong’s liberation — are what make “Revolution of Our Times” such a compelling and crucial piece of journalism. Not only does Chow work to distill a complicated problem into a moving documentary, but he also does critical work to show the protesters as genuine people, rather than radical talking heads. They are humanized and engaged with authentically, and, most importantly, it is done on their own terms, with their own words. It’s clear that Kiwi Chow and the “Hongkongers”’s documentary is a bombshell, and a necessary watch across the globe.
