After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, Occupy protesters uploaded videos of University of California Davis police pepper-spraying a line of sitting protesters. The videos have since gone viral, and the following week UC Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi announced that the police chief had been placed on administrative leave. The recordings show a police officer holding a can of pepper spray a few feet away from the protesters’ faces and walking up and down the line a couple times, all the while calmly spraying their faces.
The reported incidents of police brutality vis-à-vis the Occupy movement are disillusioning because they consist of violent harm by those who exist to prevent just that. The nonchalant manner in which the police officer pepper-sprayed the peaceful protesters, along with other incidences of brutality, is disheartening. However, such behavior is not surprising from an evolutionary perspective. What we see in scenes of police brutality are social mechanisms that had tremendous utility in the Pleistocene era but are now disruptive to civil society.
The primary factor that creates mutual antagonism between Occupy protesters and police forces is group formation. Group identities are strongly ingrained by both physical demarcations—badges and riot gear or casual clothing—and the type of words spoken by each group. The police form in tactical positions while the protesters hold signs and bind arms; each group is physically separated and clearly distinguishable. This can lead to what psychologists call in-group favoritism and out-group homogeneity; in the former phenomenon individuals of one’s group are considered favorably for little other reason than similarity, and in the latter members outside one’s group are deindividualized and perceived as homogeneous, resulting in a loss of empathy. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, this psychological phenomenon may have strengthened group cohesion and aided survival, but today it can be heavily detrimental.
With group identities firmly established a high-stress environment such as a protest can invoke other evolutionarily adaptive phenomena that can turn a peaceful assembly into a public relations disaster. Survival instincts make the opposing group seem to be a dangerous and potentially lethal force that must be apprehended. This can lead to aggression, clearly visible in the rough treatment of protesters at UC Davis and the at Harvard on November 9 when protesters grabbed a police officer’s gun belt outside of the Yard. Additionally, in the chaos of the protest, groupthink can quickly kick in as critical thinking gives way to rushed, consensus-based decision-making. That the police officers who did not themselves pepper-spray protesters did not question their group’s actions provides strong evidence that groupthink was a powerful impetus behind the events at UC Davis. Training that emphasizes a strong knowledge of group psychology and the self-awareness to sense it within one’s own group would mitigate needlessly violent police behavior.
To prevent police brutality and violent protest, we need to remember that behind a riot mask lies a face, within a mob exist individuals; our in-group should contain both protesters and police. If we cannot destroy the negative consequences of our evolutionary past, we can at least manipulate them to fit our society. Awareness of our human psychology is essential—we can only change our behavior by starting at the cognitive level. Constant metacognition, in which constituents of groups monitor themselves, is necessary for all parties involved.
When we identify psychological reasons for horrifying actions, we try to understand them in a deeper way and recognize that we are animals. We have evolved to behave a certain way in certain situations and often have less control over how we act than we realize.  That does not mean that such actions are permissible, of course; we are responsible for our own behavior and its consequences. As complex and reasoning humans, we can transcend evolutionary impulses such as aggression and in-group and out-group biases.
What this means politically is that the Occupy movement along with its subsequent governmental reaction is limited by human factors. However, similarly limited is our evaluation of Occupiers. Already, the distinction between “Occupiers” and “non-Occupiers” is bound to create an in-group and out-group mentality, leading to prejudiced judgments that become exaggerated by groupthink.  When we don’t listen to others’ opinions or stereotype them to fit our personal narratives, we destroy any potential societal gains that could result from lending the protesters a sympathetic ear and in doing so harm ourselves. The worst brutality is not always physical violence—sometimes it is out-grouping.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvey Mansfield, distinguished Harvard faculty member and William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Government, wants us to know that “men can spit, cuss, tell dirty jokes, read porn, and drink beer.” Mansfield wonders whether teaching women this “manliness” is “like teaching a cat to bark.” In fact, throughout his book “Manliness” and a more recent article in the Weekly Standard entitled “Manliness and Morality,” Harvey Mansfield propagates outdated, demeaning, and utterly unsubstantiated views on women.
Professor Mansfield notes that “manliness” is rooted in aggression and assertiveness. Substantiating this with statistics that reveal that men perpetrate far more crimes than women do, Mansfield goes on to conclude that women inherently lack aggression and assertiveness. He cites this as an explanation for women’s absence in the professional sphere.
Unfortunately, Professor Mansfield also claims scientific substantiation for misogynistic portrayals of femininity and masculinity. In “Manliness,” he writes that “studies say that men think about sex more often than women do, and what they think about is not marital bliss but ‘an active sex life.’” He provides no other scientific evidence for supposedly incontrovertible gender differences with respect to sexual activity, making no effort to divorce socialized gender roles from biological predispositions. Mansfield goes on to conclude that the fact “that men are more promiscuous than women in both attitude and behavior is perhaps the oldest common-sense fact there is... It is good to have it confirmed by science.” Again, he makes no distinction between nature and nurture, misinterpreting our culture’s gender roles as scientific facts. Indeed, Mansfield would have us know that “a wiser, more open-minded science...would not be suspicious of exaggeration and anecdote.” (Happily, Mansfield is a professor of government and not of science).
In “Manliness and Morality,” Mansfield advances other degrading theories about women, concluding that women are more childlike than men and cannot “be independent, or ‘autonomous,’ certainly not as much as modern women want to be.”
However, Mansfield’s writing is not simply misogynistic. Statements throughout “Manliness and Morality” demonstrate Professor Mansfield’s skewed and distressing perspective on rape. For example, he opines that the “home truth” of male aggression is “vindicated” by the actions of Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Arnold Schwarzenegger this summer. Mansfield thus implies that men’s propensity to rape is a natural consequence of their aggressiveness, just as women’s susceptibility to rape is a natural consequence of their vulnerability. Most shockingly of all, he makes the claim that “it certainly seems strange that being capable of rape can make a person better qualified for greatness, but it’s probably true.”
Mansfield’s analysis casts rape as a natural interaction between man and woman, implying that it is just a “home truth” that men want to molest women. This type of rhetoric is used to excuse the sexual violence experienced by hundreds of thousands of women each year in the United States. It is troubling that Mansfield, as a Harvard professor, implicitly affirms the misogynistic rhetoric of gender-based violence.
FAS recently voted to cancel former Harvard Summer School instructor Subramanian Swamy’s courses in light of the Islamophobic views expressed in a recent op-ed. In the same way that Swamy’s undeniably Islamophobic rhetoric alienates Muslim students at Harvard, Mansfield’s incontrovertibly sexist claims alienate female students as well as students of other genders. Though Mansfield’s views are not as blatantly hateful as Swamy’s, both professors perpetuate unsubstantiated and destructive stereotypes. 
Given the implications of Mansfield’s assertions about manliness, we are distressed that he interacts with students at all, let alone teaches at our university. Like Swamy, Mansfield has used his platform as a Harvard professor to publish harmful absurdities on a topic in which he has no expertise.
Professor Mansfield’s views on gender inevitably influence his performance as a Harvard faculty member. For example, any faculty member that has opposed the very existence of the Committee on Degrees in Women’s Studies should not advise freshmen on courses or concentrations. Perhaps Harvard should consider whether a man who has asserted that “men are more imaginative, more poetic, and more sublime” than woman is qualified to serve as an academic advisor to both male and female students.
Harvey Mansfield claims that women’s possession of “a more specialized vocabulary for female tasks, such as cooking” is a natural extension of their biological predisposition to servility and passivity. As students of history, social theory, and science, we posit that women possess a specialized vocabulary for female tasks because they fill roles that have been socially branded female. This and other unfounded assertions about sex and gender call into question Mansfield’s ability to fulfill his obligations as a Harvard faculty member.

On Dec. 6, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted by a large majority to exclude Indian economist Subramanian Swamy’s courses from this year’s Harvard Summer School offerings. The proposal, brought forward by Comparative Religion Professor Diana L. Eck, referenced Swamy’s inflammatory op-ed published last year in the Indian newspaper Daily News and Analysis. In the piece, Swamy calls for the destruction of mosques as retaliation for terrorist attacks in India, as well as the disenfranchisement of Indian Muslims who refuse to acknowledge Hindu ancestry. Swamy's op-ed clearly constitutes hate speech, by even the most lenient definition. As a matter of principle, there is no place for hate speech in the Harvard community. Regardless of whether Swamy’s article actually has the ability to incite violence, the worthless, hateful bile contained therein itself ought to disqualify the man from teaching at our University.  The faculty’s decision to remove Swamy from the teaching roster was wise, just, and reasonable.
For better or for worse, the Harvard name has the ability to lend authority, legitimacy, and gravitas to anyone wielding it.  Indeed, Swamy has been known to invoke his status as a Harvard professor to bolster his image in India. Considering that Swamy uses whatever prominence he has as a platform to malign the world’s Muslims, trumpeting a thickheaded and violent brand of Hindu hyper-nationalism, Harvard must not continue to add legitimacy to his name.  Swamy has shown himself to be unfit to be a member of the Harvard community, and we are thrilled that he will not be teaching this summer.
Although Swamy’s words alone would be reason enough to revoke his permission to teach, there is the further concern that his publications may incite religious violence. We live in a world that is already too plagued by sectarian conflict and needless bloodshed; the possibility that a Harvard faculty member would contribute to such tragedy is unthinkable.  Again, there is no place for such a person on the Harvard faculty.  Swamy has argued that FAS’s decision is “dangerous” and infringes on his right to free speech.  Yet, there is an important line between speech that is unpopular and controversial—and which ought to be protected—and that which is needlessly inflammatory and indefensible.  It’s clear which side of the line Swamy’s words fall on.
The Harvard community has an obligation to maintain a minimum standard of decency among its members.  Those who stand for bigotry, hatred, and violence have no place instructing students or wearing the Harvard name.  We commend the faculty for their principled decision.

To the editor:
I am writing in response to two articles you published recently advocating for a pro-life view of abortion.  Normally, I would not bother to respond. I am firmly pro-choice, but I am far from the most passionate, well-informed, or thoughtful voice on the issue and I believe I can add far more to the debate on economic matters than on the question of abortion. However, the pieces recently published in the Crimson suggest that the thought leaders (or at least editorialists) of the campus pro-life community are thoroughly uniformed about the thought that serious pro-choice thinkers have put into their positions on the matter. I will seek to correct a few of those points in the hope that next semester’s debate will move on to deeper and more considered positions.
“The Philosophical Argument for Life,” takes as its central claim the argument that “Abortion can only be permissible if the fetus is definitively not a person.” This claim utterly ignores the reasoned arguments of Judith Thomson. Thomson created her famous “violinist” example to address just this point. In that example, we awake in a hospital, connected to a famous violinist by various tubes. We are informed that in order to preserve the violinist’s life for the nine months it will take to arrange a transplant for his failing organs, we must remain where we are to aid his vital processes.
Thomson notes that there is certainly no legal obligation to cooperate with the violinist, even though the process is temporary and the person saved is indisputably a person. Rather, we are entitled to demand to be removed from the machine, killing the violinist. We may even require that the attending physicians help us to do so. The analogy with unintended pregnancy is extensive. Even if we grant the fetus full personhood, a pregnant woman is still entitled, due to her bodily autonomy, to compel it to exit her even at the cost of its own life.
Now, you may find the violinist argument thoroughly unpersuasive. However, it clearly undermines the claim that debates over abortion reduce completely to debates over fetal personhood. Strong questions of bodily autonomy are also involved, and they cannot be disregarded.
“Personally Pro Life, But . . .” disparages the “personally pro-life but politically pro-choice” position as logically incoherent based on the claim that we cannot strongly hold a moral proposition without willing it to be law. This is nonsense. For an easy, clear example, just ask any of America’s Baptists. Members of that denomination, constituting a full fifteen percent of Americans, tend to hold both that faith in Jesus Christ is morally important and also the belief of “soul competency,” that it is morally wrong to compel anyone to believe or practice religion in any way not in accordance with the dictates of their own conscience. That’s why Baptists have such a proud tradition of supporting freedom of religion.
More generally, it is perfectly coherent to have a strong, religiously motivated moral conviction but believe that, because it cannot be expressed and defended in secular terms, it ought not be enforced by the law of our secular nation. That’s where “Personally Pro Life” goes off the rails; by not acknowledging the vital question of the relationship between exclusively religious moral views and the laws of a secular state, it disregards the actual positions and understandings of the “moderate pro-choice” politicians and thinkers whose views it disparages.
“Discrimination Against Pro-Lifers” does not disregard a single, key point of pro-choice thought as the other two articles do. (Also, it nominally works to defend a postering campaign which I agree should be protected from vandalism.) However, it includes a number of fairly basic flaws, including at least one falsehood. It claims that abortions are particularly emotionally risky when in fact they tend to be safer than childbirth. It misrepresents the arguments of previous editorialists, claiming that Alexandra Atiya ’06 criticized the posters for “irritat[ing] pro-choice supporters on campus,” when her clear thesis was that the posters have an “antagonistic purpose” and “misrepresent the pro-choice members of this campus as bloodthirsty baby killers.” (Given that “Discrimination” goes on to claim the Democratic Party is “evil,” perhaps Atiya’s claim may be granted some weight.)
Clearly, abortion is an issue that produces strong feelings on both sides. I freely admit that writing this piece was an emotional experience for me, as I’m sure it was for the authors of the other pieces I’ve addressed. But if the pro-life community at Harvard College has something to contribute to the discussion, I’m certain they can do so without ignoring pro-choice arguments to make self-confident statements of total correctness or accusing its opponents of evil. Here’s hoping for a more thoughtful and more interesting discussion next semester.

Two current members of Harvard’s Computer Science Department, Professor Margo I. Seltzer and Visiting Scholar Susan Landau, were named fellows by the Association for Computing Machinery on Wednesday.
Seltzer and Landau were recognized for “contributions to data management and computing systems,” and “public policy leadership in security and privacy,” respectively.
ACM is “an educational and scientific society uniting the world’s computing educators, researchers and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field’s challenges,” according to its website. The leading one percent of ACM members are honored with fellow titles. This year, the group named 41 fellows, according to a press release.
Seltzer said her work focuses on promoting computer performance and reliability. One of her goals, she said, is to improve the storage process for digital objects such as documents or videos.
“Anything you want to keep on the computer has to be stored somewhere,” she said. “People in the field have been trying to figure out how to do it efficiently and reliably.”
In this case, “efficiency” refers to the performance level of a back-up system while “reliability” means the ability to retrieve data in the event of a crash, she explained.
Seltzer said she also works on developing the capability to trace the history of digital data.
“Software we use every day does very little with data provenance,” she says. “My group has been working on ways to make the history of data transparent and for systems to collect provenance.”
Landau’s work approaches digital security and privacy from two different angles. She described her area of research as “the intersection of policy issues and technical issues,” a field which she said is unique for a computer scientist.
Landau said she has an academic interest in computer wiretapping practices, adding that she is wary of the FBI’s desire to include wiretapping mechanisms in all digital switches. While such built-in mechanisms would enable the FBI to gain access to important digital information, they would also make it easier for outside hackers to access it, according to Landau.
“My long term interest is cyber security and having a secure, open network that is also privacy protecting,” she said. “Often security and privacy are seen as at odds but I believe that in many cases, especially in national security issues, security and privacy are the same thing.”

A hot potato game for Android-powered devices, an app that lets you know when a Facebook friend defriends you, and a tool called “Puritas” were just three of the hundreds of final projects on display at the CS50 Fair on Friday.
In its fourth year, the fair, which concludes Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I,” showcased projects developed by Harvard students to their peers and others from the surrounding community.
Music was blasting as observers headed down the stairs into the basement, greeted by enthusiastic teaching fellows wearing costumes to resemble the Angry Birds characters from the popular game.
Head TF Matthew J. Chartier ’12 said the fair gives students an opportunity to show off their projects.
“The fair is a way to demonstrate to the community at large what students are able to achieve with just one semester of computer science under their belt,” he said. “The only real constraint is the student’s imagination.”
Grace G. Gee ’15 developed an online problem set tracker, which matches up students working on the same problem set with the hope that they will be able to help each other. The tool, she said, was inspired by a hectic first semester.
“I couldn’t keep track of my problem sets, and by the time I found people to do them with, they were all already finished,” she said.
Gee used the knowledge she had learned in the CS50 lectures, as well as through the optional seminars hosted by teaching fellows that were specific to different areas in programming.
William Z. Chen ’14, Changlin Li ’14, and Felix J. Wong ’14 created a database of 7,000 colleges through which prospective college applicants can search according to parameters they set.
Chen said the database is currently available online and fully functional at the web address atcollege.info.
The fair is the culmination of a course that has become a sort of brand on campus, with its own set of merchandise that students were wearing at the fair and a culture that celebrates the technical and nerdy.
“When you’re just brought into a new school environment, it’s nice to have a class that has a really strong culture to it and let’s you feel like part of a community,” CS50 student Sarah C. Rosenthal ’15 said.
Some students plan to continue to improve their projects over the winter recess and launch them on the internet for public use.
For her problem set tracker, Gee said she plans to integrate it with Facebook and purchase her own domain name.
“Maybe if it works well here, I’ll expand it to other colleges,” she said.
The course head, David J. Malan ’99, praised the fair.
“The CS50 Fair was such fun this year, particularly since we had all the more students in the class who’d never programmed prior to term’s start,” Malan said. “And to see everyone come together at term’s end with hundreds of their own creations was really quite inspiring.”
And of the hundreds of projects on display, which one was Malan’s favorite?
“I love them all equally,” he said.

Emulsions—mixtures of oil droplets suspended in water—may take much longer to reach equilibrium than previously expected, according to a recent study by Harvard researchers.
In a class of mixtures called Pickering emulsions, solid particles bind to the interface between two liquids that usually do not mix, such as oil and water. The particles keep the two liquids from separating, allowing products like ice cream, mayonnaise, and many lotion products to have a reasonable shelf life.
But in a paper published in Nature Materials on December 4, a team led by Harvard Chemical Engineering and Physics Professor Vinothan N. Manoharan discovered that these particles may take months or even years to settle into place. The process was previously thought to be instantaneous, according to David M. Kaz, an author of the study who received his Ph.D. in Physics at Harvard this fall.
“We’ve introduced a lot of questions that are relevant to anyone preparing Pickering emulsions in a controlled fashion,” Kaz said. “We’ve provided a new insight into what might be happening after they’ve been prepared.”
In the study, the researchers observed a tiny particle, a few microns in diameter, as it approached a layer of oil floating on top of water. By using digital holography, they reconstructed three-dimensional images of the particle’s path, finding that the particle slowed down dramatically after reaching the oil-water boundary.
“Our experiments went up to about 100 seconds, but by extrapolating the data to the point where we think the equilibrium is, we estimated a time scale ... of months to years [for the particle to become stable],” said Manoharan.
According to Kaz, the oil-water interface snags on imperfections on the particle, impeding its movement. The process might be quicker if the particle was moving with more energy, he said. Thus, the amount of energy input should matter when preparing an emulsion.
The results have applications to understanding many common substances. In mayonnaise, for example, Kaz explained that egg yolk proteins play the role of solid particles which stabilize the emulsion. By binding to the surface of tiny oil droplets, they create “armored droplets” that are less likely to coalesce. This prevents the oil and water in mayonnaise from separating.
“When people consider how emulsions are aging, they consider temperature or chemical processes that would make the emulsion change over time,” Kaz said. “Now they can ask: how did we prepare it?”
Kaz added that he thinks the results are not limited to understanding emulsions, as a similar process is used in water purification and mineral recovery.

A recent Facebook poll has generated interest from the Harvard community in what could be the opening of Harvard Square’s only all-kosher restaurant.
In the poll by Rami’s, a kosher Israeli restaurant in Brookline, Harvard Square received the most votes for a potential second location.
Manager Haim Cohen released the Facebook poll on Dec. 2, with options for a second location, including four Massachusetts cities—Boston, Cambridge, Framingham, and Sharon—as well as Maine and Philadelphia.
The poll did not receive much attention and previously had Sharon in the lead until Dec. 4, when Cambridge received nearly 100 votes overnight, according to Cohen. Overall, Cambridge received nearly 200 votes.
After the high response from that poll, Cohen released another asking for a specific location in Cambridge.
A student sent an email linking to the poll over the Harvard Orthodox Student Minyan list, which brought awareness to the potential of a kosher restaurant coming to the Square.
Still, the Facebook poll is only a start to gauge public interest in a new location for Rami’s, Cohen said.
“We’re looking for a place with a lot of foot traffic and visibility,” he said, adding that Harvard Square meets those criteria.
Rami’s menu offers Middle Eastern cuisine, including falafel, hummus, and shwarma. All products are homemade and follow kosher standards.
Current kosher options for Harvard students are limited.
Harvard Hillel serves kosher dinner five days a week during the academic year. Harvard dining halls also offer kosher options.
“If you keep kosher, it’s hard to find options other than what’s in the dining halls,” Harry A. Chiel ’13 said.
Other kosher options include J.P. Lick’s, Lizzie’s and Ben & Jerry’s—all ice cream shops.
“It would be nice to have a restaurant nearby if you want to go somewhere with your friends who don’t necessarily eat kosher,” Rachel E. Zax ’12 said.
Brookline is home to several kosher restaurants.
“People will go out to Brookline and take the bus just to get some pizza. Having a restaurant in Harvard Square would be fantastic,” said Arun A. Viswanath ’13, outgoing president of Harvard Hillel.
Rebecca Goldstein ’13 said she sees the success of a kosher meat restaurant depending on the community.
“Now that there’s a big kosher community in Cambridge, I think they would get a lot of business,” Goldstein said.
Sharon Weiss-Greenberg, Orthodox advisor at Harvard Hillel, said she thinks the presence of kosher restaurant option in the Square could contribute to students’ decisions on where to attend school.
“[This restaurant] could help the Jewish community grow and flourish. People are surprised that there’s so little here that’s kosher,” she said.

Boston police closed in on the Occupy Boston encampment in the wee hours of Saturday morning, ending the more than 70-day-long occupation of Dewey Square.
The Boston police first issued an eviction notice to the occupiers on Thursday night. While some of the protestors removed their belongings, the half-acre encampment attracted more than a thousand people to the square, according to the New York Times.
The occupation ended peacefully, as city officials swept through the camp arresting dozens and destroying what remained of the camping gear with a trash compactor.
Despite ordering the raid, Mayor Thomas M. Menino said he remained sympathetic to the concerns of the occupiers.
“They shined a much needed light, still needed, on growing economic inequality in this country. In the end, they also acted with restraint, I thank them for that,” Menino said at a news conference, according to the Times.
Fenna M. Krienen, a Harvard graduate student in psychology who was present on Thursday night when occupiers were preparing for a raid, bemoaned Boston’s reaction to the Occupy encampment.
“I think that it’s unfortunate that Boston has reacted in a way that so many other cities have reacted, but I was so heartened to see how many people showed up. It seems there were around 700 the first [General Assembly],” she said.
But Sage E. Radachowsky, a research technician in a Harvard biology lab who was present the night of the raid, said that he believed the closing of the encampment represents an opportunity for Occupy to expand its horizons.
“I think this will allow the movement to evolve further,” Radachowsky said.  “I think that there are lots of effective new avenues that Occupy can explore.”
Among the group at the Occupy Boston encampment in Dewey Square on Thursday night were 30 Harvard affiliates, according to Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Neil Peterman.
Peterman, who is involved with both Occupy Boston and Occupy Harvard, said that Occupy Boston would continue even without the encampment in Dewey Square. The movement has spread already to a number of neighborhoods throughout Boston as well as to all of the major universities in the area, according to Peterman.
“The slogan is ‘evict us, we multiply. Occupy will never die,’” he said.
Harvard affiliates participating in the Occupy Harvard movement said they did not expect the clearing out of Occupy Boston to have any impact on the movement’s encampment in Harvard Yard.
“I see no ramifications. We stand in solidarity and we’ll continue to do so,” said Krienen, a graduate student in psychology who was present in Dewey Square on Thursday night. “We’re going to keep going.”

Last summer, eight-year-old Allston resident John Paul Franks told his mother that he wanted to learn more about computers.
“I wanted to write about computers—and take them apart,” Franks said.
And so at his request, Franks began spending an hour each week this semester disassembling and writing about old computers with the help of his mentor Stewart O. Pine ’14 at the Harvard Allston Education Portal.
Franks and Pine were paired through the Ed Portal’s academic mentoring program, which matched 24 Harvard undergraduate mentors with local youth this year to explore their fields of interest.
On Sunday afternoon, Franks was one of a handful of local elementary school students who presented their projects at a science fair-style showcase and open house event at the Ed Portal.
Franks stood quietly behind his display table as parents, mentors, Harvard administrators, and fellow elementary school students mobbed around his handbook, titled “The Major Parts of the Computer,” and several disassembled motherboards.
Other student projects included a creative writing piece about a type of whale called a narwhal, an analysis of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and a science demonstration that modeled lava lamps with chemical flasks, food coloring, and Alka-Seltzer tablets.
Harvard administrators and Allston residents alike point to the Ed Portal’s active engagement and collaboration with the community as a primary reason for its success and popularity amongst local residents. Other University programs in Allston have received more lukewarm responses.
In Dec. 2009, the University halted construction in Allston due to fallout from the previous year’s financial crisis in a decision that left many Allston residents suspicious of the University’s intentions.
But the Ed Portal, which was founded in 2008 at the intersection of Western Ave. and North Harvard St., has helped the University bridge the gap to disgruntled residents by seeking their input.
“The Ed Portal is an example of what we want to do more of in consultation with the community,” said Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey. “The Ed Portal is organically rising up from the community through positive interactions with undergraduates.”
Brighton resident Lisa Lee said the Ed Portal mentorship program was responsive to her daughter Olivia’s personal interests. Although Lisa originally signed Olivia up for math tutoring, her daughter presented a science project in the final showcase.
“I think that was Olivia’s showing a little more interest in science experiments,” Lisa said.
According to University Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, the collaborative spirit of the Ed Portal is “basically what we hope to build up as we bring more of our activities into the community,” adding that the University “tried to replicate this kind of concept in the I-Lab”—a new space at Harvard Business School designed to foster innovation and entrepreneurship.
Ed Portal Faculty Director Robert A. Lue, who delivered remarks at the event, said he hopes the new annex to the Ed Portal—which will open near the start of next semester—will broaden the Ed Portal’s programming to include recreation and wellness.
“We’re about to see the universe in this building really expand,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp announced Friday that the Harvard Management Company will review business practices of HEI Hotels & Resorts, a controversial company which has come under fire from Occupy Harvard and other student advocacy groups for allegedly unjust labor practices.
HEI, which is currently under investigation by the National Labor Relations Board, has been a central focus of the Occupy Harvard campaign. Last month Yale University announced that it would not reinvest in HEI, joining the University of Pennsylvania and Brown University, who both announced that they would not reinvest in HEI earlier this year.
HEI manages a number of private equity real estate funds, meaning that investors committed to a fund would be unable to immediately sell their stake. But investors like HMC would be able to choose not to commit capital to future funds.
While the University’s statement does not commit Harvard to not reinvesting in HEI, it does suggest that Harvard will be rigorously evaluating the ethics and lawfulness of HEI’s practices.
“Harvard University has followed with interest reports concerning labor relations at HEI Hotels & Resorts,” said Lapp in the statement. “The Harvard Management Company, as part of its investment and due-diligence process, will review HEI’s business practices and policies, including labor relations, and its compliance with industry standards, regulations and laws, prior to making any decision to re-invest in HEI-sponsored investment funds.”
Student activists said that they felt the statement was too vague, but that they were generally pleased with Harvard’s announcement.
“The statement is unclear about what the next steps for Harvard are,” said Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a Harvard Occupier and member of the Student Labor Action Movement. “But I am feeling really positive about [the statement]; I think it points to Harvard heading in the right direction.”
However, union representative Wayne M. Langley said the statement is too weak to signify real change.
“The thing about this statement is that it does not commit Harvard to any kind of ethical investing in the future,” said Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, the union that represents Harvard custodians and security guards. “It’s perplexing that Harvard is shying away from committing to a broader practice of ethical investing.”
Narefsky also noted the lack of commitment to broader ethical investing and said that such a commitment can only follow increased transparency of University investments.
“I think the next step is a more concerted push for transparency,” Narefsky said. “There’s no reason why all of Harvard’s investments should not be subjected to this type of scrutiny.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just 16, Saheela O. Ibraheem ’15 waited in line, anxious to participate in a Harvard Square ritual—watching the R-rated Rocky Horror Picture Show late Saturday evening.
Her friend whispered to her in line, “Don’t worry, just give her the card, and she won’t notice.”
Ibraheem slipped her HUID card under the glass window and waited.
“It felt like an eon and a half, waiting anxiously as she inspected my card, seeing the date and meticulously calculating in her head exactly what it meant,” Ibraheem said.
The cashier passed the ID back. “I’m sorry, but I can’t let you in. You must be 17 to buy a ticket.”
While most Harvard freshman are 17 or 18 years old when they arrive on campus, every year Harvard also admits much younger students. Though these young students prove their academic prowess in the admissions process, their age can pose challenges. Some of these are legal hurdles: none of the students in this story will be of legal drinking age while in college. None were able to apply for internships, vote for their preferred political candidates, or even buy cold medicine at the local CVS during their freshman year. Perhaps more importantly, some young students say they face social obstacles when they arrive on campus.
But for the most part, these students learned how to be the youngest person in the room before they ever got to Harvard.
“It was more noticeable in high school, because I went to a small private school so everyone knew,” Ibraheem said. “People would view me differently.”
Now, at Harvard, other students help her fit in.
After getting turned away for the Rocky Horror Picture Show, she found a stranger old enough to help her buy a ticket.
Embarrassed by the experience, Ibraheem said she doesn’t expect to head to an R-rated movie again until May when she turns 17.
“It was embarrassing as a college student to beg someone to buy me a ticket.” she said. “[But] as bad as it sounds, it was an experience, and I’m glad I can tell the story.”
‘NO AGE LIMITS’
Harvard does not consider age as a factor when admitting students to the incoming freshmen class, administrators say.
“We have no age limits. We’re really looking at individuals on the basis of individual achievement and personal characteristics,” said Marlyn E. McGrath ’70, the Harvard College director of admissions. “Certainly, maturity and self-direction and the capacity to thrive and benefit at Harvard is always a factor, but none of those qualities are associated in any way that we know with chronological age.”
McGrath said that Harvard does not keep statistics on the average age of entering freshmen, but she said she believes that the average age is just shy of 18. McGrath said that the College has even admitted students older than 60.
According to “Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636-1936” by Samuel E. Morison, Class of 1908, “The median age of entering freshmen rose from a low of little over fifteen years in 1741 to seventeen years in 1769, and stayed at about that point for the rest of the century.”
By 1869, the average age of a Harvard undergraduate entering the freshman class was 18, until President Charles W. Eliot, Class of 1853, raised that average to 19 in 1883, according to Morison’s book on Harvard’s history.
“The real issue is readiness to use Harvard well in all the normal ways, whatever someone’s age might be,” said William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, dean of admissions and financial aid.
GROWING UP AT HARVARD
Once admitted to the College, young students say that, for the most part, they’re able to fit in.
“Harvard ... treats me like any other freshman,” said Lelaina E. Vogel ’15, who turned 17 this past July and won’t turn 21 until after she graduates.
Some students said that before moving into their Harvard Yard dormitories, they were nervous about being among the youngest people on campus.
Martin A. Camacho ’14 said he felt apprehensive about fitting in socially; he was not sure if he’d be accepted because he was a couple years younger than everyone else. He entered the fifth grade at age five and matriculated to Harvard at 15.
High school had been difficult, he said, but fortunately his social experience here at Harvard has been a positive one.
“I think people are much more respectful,” Camacho said. “High school was very hard to fit in socially for the first couple of years. Everyone would recognize that I was younger than them.”
Ibraheem said she had a similar experience in high school, but when she arrived on campus many students simply didn’t realize that she was younger than they were.
“I feel like when they know I’m younger, it’s usually after they’ve already gotten to know me, so it doesn’t affect our relationship,” she said.
Camacho said he doesn’t really tell people his age because no one really asks. “If I do tell them, it’s because I know they’ll be fine with it,” he said.
For many of these students, being young is a piece of their identity.
“It’s a part of who I am, I suppose. I’ve always grown up quickly,” Vogel said. “I come from an area where I had a life that I had to grow up quickly in order to make it.”
Even if students did treat her differently for her age, Vogel said she wouldn’t know how they would treat her otherwise.
YOUNG GENIUSES
Academically, these young students thrive in their respective activities and classes around campus. Vogel is involved in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club and American Repertory Theater; Ibraheem is a member of the Harvard Shotokan Karate Club and a daring Math 55 student; Camacho is on the Harvard Quiz Bowl team and a course assistant for this semester’s Math 25a course.
Camacho, 16, teaches weekly sections for the course, which consists of students generally two to three years older than him. Still, Camacho finds the circumstances completely normal.
“I find it funny at times just because I know they’re older than me,” Camacho said. “I’m very comfortable with it. I don’t think most even know how old I am.”
Furthermore, Vogel said she believes that her age may actually serve to benefit her academically.
“I’ve been working at the same level of people who are older than me, which means that I have time to achieve higher levels, whereas other people might be limited,” Vogel said. “I have that space of time to mature my experiences and gather knowledge that I feel other people have less of.”
The young students agree that their age differences have actually widened their ranges of experiences, in comparison to other people of the same age.
Said Susie J. Yi ’13, who was 16 as a freshman, “I think I’ve been exposed to a lot more things than people my age [because] people my age are generally just entering college.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard teaching fellow Bradley J. Spencer was arrested earlier this month on charges that he sexually assaulted a woman on the Red Line.
At a hearing Monday, he pleaded not guilty to charges of indecent assault and battery, according to Cara O’Brien, a spokesperson for the Middlesex County District Attorney’s office.
According to the Cambridge Chronicle, Spencer, who is a teaching fellow in the Near Eastern and Languages and Civilizations Department, was charged with the assault of a 32-year-old Cambridge resident. The victim reported that she noticed a man standing unusually close to her on the MBTA. She then felt something push against her crotch and looked down to see a hand close to her crotch.
The victim said that she was too surprised to react to Spencer’s alleged assault but said that she managed to take a picture with her cell phone before getting off the T and notifying the police, according to the Chronicle.
Spencer’s bail was set at $1,000, according to O’Brien, and he paid it and was released after his arraignment Monday. Spencer was returned to jail following a hearing Tuesday morning, on $5,000 bail this time with the condition that, if he is released, he is to stay away from the MBTA and other forms of public transportation. During the hearing, a probation officer informed Judge Sevelin Singleton III that the probation office would be able to outfit Spencer with an electronic tracking bracelet. Singleton ordered Spencer to appear in court again Friday morning, when he will receive such a bracelet.
Spencer’s defense attorney, Steven Linehan, declined to comment.
Spencer, 36, is a NELC graduate student studying Semitic philology. This year, Spencer taught a section for the course Ancient Near East 104: “Babylon.” Spencer will not be teaching next semester according to an emailed statement from University spokesperson Jeff Neal.
“Generally speaking, in cases where a student has been accused of a serious crime, that student is often asked to leave campus during the course of the investigation and legal proceedings, pending their outcome,” Neal wrote.
Students in Spencer’s section characterized him as considerate and able to run section well.
“I was a little surprised because he really is such a nice guy,” said Tyler G. Funk ’12, a student in Spencer’s section. “In his sections he does a great job of running the entire class.”
Paul A. Bowden ’13, another student in his section, said that his teaching method was not anything out of the ordinary.
“He was a little weird—a couple of friends in the section had agreed he was strange,” Bowden said. “But everyone at Harvard is a little weird, so I didn’t find it out of the norm for him to be bizarre.”
Students also described Spencer as religious, noting his tendencies to get sidetracked by religious discussions.
“A couple times half the section was about him going over stuff in the Bible,” Bowden said.
Peter Machinist, the director of undergraduate studies for NELC, declined to comment since the matter is under criminal investigation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s fencing team does not compete at home very often—but when it does, the Crimson makes it count.
Led by co-captain Caroline Vloka and sophomore Alex Kiefer, Harvard (6-1) continued its early success Saturday with a 22-4 home victory over Tufts (0-1) at the Malkin Athletic Center.
One year ago, the Crimson trounced the Jumbos, 20-7, in its only home dual match of the season.
With an added year of experience under their belts, Vloka and Kiefer—NCAA champions in the saber and foil, respectively—helped widen this year’s margin of victory over Tufts, which has never beaten Harvard.
“Just from previous experience—my being a senior—we’ve never really had any problems [with the Jumbos],” Vloka said. “We’ve blown them out of the water every time. We weren’t really worried, not to sound cliched.”
Vloka and Kiefer each went undefeated in their three bouts this weekend, helping Harvard to its 29th straight victory at home since 2002-03.
Saturday’s win marked the latest positive showing for the Crimson this fall. Last month, Vloka took gold in the sabre division at the season-opening Garret Open, where in the foil Kiefer matched her teammate’s accomplishment. The squad then went 5-1 at the Penn State Invitational two weeks later, dropping Temple, North Carolina, NYU, Sacred Heart, and Vassar while losing to defending national champion Penn State.
“I don’t think I’ve ever done this well, so I hope to keep it going,” said Vloka, who remains undefeated on the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first meet of the season, the Crimson flirted with history.
The Harvard track and field team kicked off its indoor season on Saturday by hosting the Harvard Open at Gordon Indoor Track. The squad competed against schools and unattached runners from as far away as Washington state. Though a limited number of the Crimson’s athletes took part, the few that did turned in strong performances—including some that were just short of all-time Harvard records.
“I think the team performed really well today,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We had a limited number of student-athletes competing, but those that did compete performed really well. We had a number of personal bests that were set today. It was really exciting.”
On the women’s side, freshman Ashley Collinsworth began her career for the Crimson in style. The first year participated in the 60-meter and 200-meter dash events. In her preliminary heat in the 60-meter, Collinsworth sprinted to first place with a time of 7.76, outpacing the second-place finisher by 0.25 seconds. The rookie’s time was the sixth-fastest in program history.
Junior Olivia Weeks set a personal-best in the triple jump, leaping 12.23 meters to capture the event title. The junior’s mark was third-best in Crimson history.
“I’ve been a lot stronger this year,” Weeks said. “I’ve been making a lot of technical changes to my jump, so I was hoping that they’d pay off, and I’d be able to execute.”
“I didn’t have a set goal going into [the triple jump],” Weeks added. “But I was pleased.”
Like Collinsworth and Weeks, sophomore thrower Adabelle Ekechukwu also rewrote the record books on Saturday. The Oak Brook, Ill.-native placed second in the weight throw with a distance of 18.26 meters. Ekechukwu’s mark was not only her personal-best but also the second-best distance in program history.
“[Ekechukwu] had a great freshman campaign,” Saretsky said. “She looks poised to build on the success that she had last year.”
Ekechukwu indicated that changes in her practice regimen have allowed her to reach a new level of throwing.
“Last year, I was learning a lot of the basics,” said Ekechukwu, who is also a Crimson arts and photo editor. “This year, we’re working more on the technical elements of our lifting and throwing sessions. I think it’s the progression from basic to technical that has really made the difference.”
Not to be outdone by their female counterparts, the Harvard men brought their ‘A’ game to Gordon Indoor.
Freshman Ben Glauser hurled his way to first place in the shot put with a throw of 17.35 meters, which landed him fourth in Crimson history.
“I was confident going into it,” Glauser said. “I was happy to hit a throw like that in the second round [of the shot put event].”
Though Glauser indicated that he was satisfied with his performance, the rookie has his eyes on an even loftier goal.
“I knew I wasn’t going to hit the all-time record [on Saturday],” Glauser said. “Maybe [I will] in another month or so.”
In the men’s mile, it was all Harvard.
Senior middle distance runner Darcy Wilson led the way, earning first place in a field of 69 with a time of 4:14.69.
“[Wilson] took the race out and led wire to wire,” Saretsky said. “He didn’t have anyone pushing him, which really isn’t his style; he likes to feed off of the energy of others. But he went out and ran a great race today.”
Harvard placed five men in the mile’s top 12 spots. Sophomore middle distance runner Ryan Romain followed Wilson and finished with a time of 4:17.70. Behind Romain were junior Weishen Mead and sophomore Tyler Cusick, who finished in seventh and 10th place, respectively.
“The best is still to come from both our men’s and women’s classes,” Saretsky said. “Today, we saw glimpses of what’s to come. I’m really looking forward to seeing what they put together during the championship part of our season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Best Buy Classic in Minneapolis, Minn., the Harvard women’s basketball team leveled its record at 4-4 with a win against Alcorn State Friday, but the squad quickly fell back below .500 with a loss against Minnesota the following day.
“The first night was a really good win against a really athletic team,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We played [Minnesota] really well. I was pretty pleased that we were playing them evenly with about eight minutes to go even though our shots weren’t falling, and then we just lost our legs.”
MINNESOTA 79, HARVARD 53
After cruising to a 78-55 win on Friday, Harvard found itself in the opposite situation the following day. The Crimson fell to Minnesota by nearly the same score, 79-53, on Saturday.
Following a 50-percent shooting performance from the field against Alcorn State in its first game of the Best Buy Classic, Harvard (4-5) made only 29 percent of its attempts against the Golden Gophers (6-5).
The loss snapped the Crimson’s three-game winning streak.
“We unfortunately had to play back-to-back days and Minnesota didn’t,” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s just an incredible disadvantage. The score was not an indication of the game. Three quarters of the game were well played and fairly competitive.”
Harvard fell behind 9-2 early and held only one lead during the duration of the contest.
While the Crimson kept the game within single digits for most of the first 30 minutes of play, Minnesota extended its lead late.
A Missy Mullins jump shot with 9:30 left cut the Gophers’ lead to seven, 49-42, but Minnesota responded quickly. Three minutes later, the Gophers held a comfortable 19-point advantage.
“They capitalized on our defensive lapses in second half,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “With a team like Minnesota, you can’t take any possessions off on defense. We were playing on our heels during the second half.”
In the losing effort, junior forward Emma Golen led the Crimson with a career-high 13 points, 10 of which came in the first half.
Berry came close to registering a triple-double, finishing with 11 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds.  Those eight assists were enough to push her into fourth place in assists in Harvard history with 439.
Sophomore guard Christine Clark also reached double digits, extending her streak of tallying 10 or more points to 11 straight games going back to last season.
But she missed her second free throw of the night after making 29 of her last attempts at the charity stripe.
HARVARD 78, ALCORN STATE 55
With the game tied at 7-7 in its early stages, an Emma Golen three sparked a Harvard 21-3 run that give it an early 18-point lead.
The Crimson would not look back, as it rolled by Alcorn State, 78-55, Friday.
“We came out really strong against Alcorn State,” Berry said. “It was a feel good game. I think we needed it.”
After starting the year 0-3, Harvard won three of its next four contests to level its record at 4-4.
Alcorn State has been unable to recover from early season woes and now finds itself at 0-6.
“Their record is deceiving because they’ve played some big time programs,” Delaney-Smith said. “I thought we played really well against them.”
Junior forward Victoria Lippert led the team early, finishing with 13 points in the first half before the team entered the locker room with an eight-point lead.
The Crimson extended its lead further in the second half, as Berry tallied 13 second-half points and Clark added 14.
Berry led the squad with a game-high 19 points.
Four players finished in double figures for the Ivy representative.
Clark totaled 16 points, eight of which came at the free-throw line. The sophomore stretched her made-free-throws streak to 28.
In Harvard’s first of two games in the Best Buy Classic, the offense clicked. The team made exactly half of its 52 field-goal attempts and benefited from 44 rebounds compared to Alcorn State’s 28.
“Alcorn State was an athletic and physical team,” Berry said. “Our turnovers were way too high, but our defense was there, and our rebounding has been strong all year. There was a lot more good than bad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite having to deal with the academic stress and worries typical of reading period, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team continued its streak of domination this past Friday, nabbing victories against Ivy League rivals Columbia and Penn.
The Crimson (4-0) defeated the Quakers (1-3), 249-49, and the Lions (2-1), 157-143, at the double-dual tri-meet at New York City’s Uris Pool. Though in past years Columbia has not been one of Harvard’s more competitive rivals, the Lions surprised the Crimson this weekend, swimming faster than ever before. The team set five Uris Pool records, and the final score, 157-143, marks the closest match between the two schools in history.
“It’s a really stressful time of the year, with finals and papers due this week, and so we didn’t have our whole team—we ended up bringing just a few girls,” sophomore Jenna Gregoire said. “We put together the best lineup that we could, and, ultimately, it ended up being really close with Columbia. They gave us a run for our money, which was interesting because Columbia typically isn’t really a big competitor for us. So it was really exciting to go up there and put up some pretty fast times considering where we are in the season and the school year, with finals and everything.”
Although Columbia took an early lead, earning victories in the first two events of the day, Harvard made a strong comeback in the meet’s third event, sweeping the 1000-yard freestyle. Freshmen Courtney Otto (10:04:96) and Kelsey Hojan-Clark (10:09:22) took first and second, respectively, and senior Catherine Zagroba posted a time of 10:11:52 to earn third.
Otto would go on to win two more events that day, including the 500-yard freestyle and the 200-yard butterfly, the latter of which the Crimson also swept. Otto led the 1-2-3 finish with a time of 2:00.32, followed by sophomore Danielle Schulkin (2:02.80) and senior Hilary Roberts (2:03.04).
“Courtney was fantastic,” Gregiore said. “Those three events were really an incredible combination to start with, some of the hardest events on the list, and she swam all three of them exceptionally well. ... The freshmen in general bring so much energy to the team. They’re a great group of girls, and we’re so lucky to have them.”
One-two-three finishes seemed to be a theme of the meet, with the Harvard diving team earning a sweep of its own in the one-meter dive. Sophomore Alex Stanton scored 259.15 to grab the top spot, while senior Leslie Rea (257.95) and sophomore Schuyler Moore (254.20) took second and third, respectively. Moore and Rea also placed in the top three in the three-meter dive competition.
“It was really incredible because we had just had the threemeter event, and though we dove well, we knew we could do better,” Stanton said. “Then, at the break right after that, the score was announced, and we were down against Columbia by a point, so we knew we had to do our part and sweep the event. Winning for me was incredible, but the 1-2-3 finish was even better, we were all so excited about that.”
Aside from Otto’s three victories and Stanton’s win, the Crimson also had first-place finishes in the 50-yard freestyle, with Gregoire’s performance of 23.95, and in the 200-yard backstroke, with senior Meghan Leddy’s time of 2:00.30.
Though the host Lions won 10 of the meet’s 16 events, Harvard still managed to pull out a win, extending its undefeated streak in the Ivy League to four games. This is the eighth consecutive season that the team has opened with at least four successive victories, and the two wins at Friday’s tri-meet have provided the squad with a much-needed push in momentum as it heads towards February’s Ivy League Championships. The Crimson took second in last year’s Ivies and have been working for first place ever since.
“The two wins let us know that we have to keep working hard during break because we really do have a chance at winning Ivies,” Stanton said. “The meet was closer than we wanted it to be, but that hasn’t brought us down—it’s just given everyone the extra motivation that we need to become a better, faster team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team stepped out onto the Uris Pool deck in New York City on Saturday afternoon, it did so with the pressure of having not lost to an Ivy opponent in over two years.
It left with its streak intact, as the Crimson overtook Columbia (2-2, 1-2 Ivy), 206-92, winning 13 of the 16 events and taking a 1-2-3 finish in six races. This victory marks the 12th consecutive dual meet win for Harvard (3-0, 3-0 Ivy) and its 10th straight Ivy League win.
“I think [it] was a great meet,” freshman Mike Gaudiani said. “We had a lot of energy going into it, and it really showed. We had numerous fast swims, and the team just really kicked butt.”
Freshman Chuck Katis highlighted the meet, setting three pool records in the 100-yard breaststroke, 200-yard breaststroke, and 200-yard individual medley.
The Crimson began the meet strongly, with a first-place finish in the three-meter dive by freshman Mike Mosca, who posted a score of 379.28 points.
The 200-yard medley relay team, composed of Katis, sophomores Jack Pretto and Chris Satterthwaite, and senior Niall Janney, came out on top with a time of 1:31.01—nearly two seconds faster than the Lions’ relay team.
“The 200 medley relay went pretty well,” Pretto said. “It’s nice to get up and compete with the relays and swim as fast as you can because there [are] not that many opportunities.”
Harvard followed up the relay’s performance with its first 1-2-3 finish in the 1000-yard freestyle.
Gaudiani led the Crimson with a time of 9:27.94, while freshmen Reed Snyder and John Bailey finished in second and third with times of 9:31.19 and 9:34.32, respectively. Sophomore Spenser Goodman continued the first-place streak in the 200-yard freestyle with a 1:38.56 finish.
“Harvard has incredible depth in our distance program,” Gaudiani said. “And we all swam really fast today across the board, so I think that played a huge part in our success.”
In the 200-yard backstroke, Columbia freshman Omar Arafa claimed victory with a time of 50.20. Pretto, co-captain Rob Newell, and junior Ian Mirisola came in close behind with a 2-3-4 finish with times of 50.56, 50.87, and 52.87, respectively.
Katis then set his first pool record of the day in the 100-yard breaststroke at 55.18. The event was also another 1-2-3 finish for Harvard, as junior Owen Wurzbacher finished in 57.60 and sophomore Jason Ting in 58.19.
Freshman Kyle McIntee added another victory for the Crimson in the 200-yard butterfly with a time of 1:48.72. Janney contributed second-place points with his finish at 1:51.08.
Satterthwaithe placed first in the 50-yard freestyle with a personal best of 20.71. Sophomore Willy Brophy also posted his best time in the event, coming in third at 21.39.
Harvard took its third 1-2-3 finish in the 100-yard freestyle with another first-place finish by Satterthwaite, who clocked in at 44.74. Goodman took second in the event with a personal best of 45.94 and sophomore Danny Crigler came in at 46.34.
Columbia freshman Jeremie Dezwirek took the 200-yard backstroke with a time of 1:49.19. Newell touched just .58 seconds after at 1:49.77.
The Crimson returned to the top with another pool record by Katis in the 200-yard breaststroke. The freshman led Harvard’s fourth 1-2-3 finish, clocking in at 2:00.76. Wurzbacher came in second with a time of 2:05.59, followed by Ting, finishing at 2:07.42.
Gaudiani swept the distance races, earning a victory in the 500-yard freestyle, coming in at 4:35.03. Junior Greg Roop finished closely behind Gaudiani with a time of 4:35.86.
“I was feeding off of a lot of the team’s energy,” Gaudiani said. “We went in there, and we swept the top three places for the 1000 and the 500, so I think that was really a big motivation.”
The Crimson’s final two 1-2-3 finishes occurred in back-to-back races: the 100-yard butterfly and the 200-yard individual medley.
McIntee took first in the butterfly with a personal best of 50.07. Janney landed second place, touching the wall at 50.52, and junior Ryan Cutter earned a third-place finish with a time of 50.99.
Katis swam a personal-best at 1:48.56 in the individual medley, notching both a first-place finish and a new Uris Pool record. Newell came in second, finishing at 1:52.62 and Mirisola contributed third-place points with a time of 1:52.95.
In the final event, Columbia earned some points back after both of Harvard’s 400-yard freestyle relay teams were disqualified. Although the Lions raked in 15 points, it was not enough to overcome its sizeable deficit.
“The coach got up and told us he saw us competing more as a team than ever,” Pretto said. “I think we came together ... we swam more united than ever, trying to incorporate the new freshmen, and everyone was just on the same page.”

One week after landing in the ESPN/USA Today coaches poll and the Associated Press Top 25 poll for the first time in school history, Harvard men's basketball narrowly missed another week-long stay in the national rankings Monday.
The Crimson (9-1) received 73 points in the AP poll and 43 points in the coaches poll to fall to the first in the Others receiving votes category—essentially No. 26.
Harvard lost to No. 9/10 UConn (8-1) on Thursday before walloping Boston University on Saturday.

It has been more than a month since the tents of Occupy Harvard first appeared in the Yard, and after weeks of flashing IDs and secretly pining for the return of statue-loving tourists, students are now voicing their thoughts on the Occupy Harvard movement in a new survey. According to the results, it appears that the student body hasn't taken too kindly to our resident campers.
The survey was conducted by a group of three Statistics 104 students as their research project for the class. They collected responses from 1,035 undergraduates and asked them to rate their impression of Occupy Harvard on a scale of 0-10 (0 being strongly negative, 10 being strongly positive).
They found that the average rating of Occupy Harvard was 2.84 out of 10. Freshmen, who had the highest rate of response among the classes, rated the movement slightly lower, at 2.67, while the upperclassmen average was 2.98.
"It's a pretty divisive issue on campus. Everyone's talking about [Occupy Harvard] in the dining halls and in classes, and there's a lot of talk going around about how people feel about it," said group member Michael C. George '14, who is also a Crimson news editor. He said he hoped the survey would provide a more quantitative look at students' sentiments toward the movement.
"I wasn't expecting it to be as negative as it was," said group member Anna R. Veverica '13 of the overall campus attitude toward Occupy Harvard. She said she was also surprised that students' attitudes toward Occupy Harvard were significantly more negative than their views of the Occupy movement in general, which earned an average rating of 4.76 among freshmen and 5.08 among upperclassmen.
The surveyors found that ideology seemed to play a very significant role in students' responses. Those who identified as conservative, leaning conservative, or moderate gave Occupy Harvard a rating of 1.66 while the average rating of liberals and those leaning liberal was 3.83. George said that conservatives seemed to be very unified against Occupy Harvard, while liberal responses were more varied.
Economics, government, math, and science concentrators were also more likely to have a negative impression of Occupy Harvard, and frequency at which students had to show their IDs to guards was correlated with a more negative rating.
Factors that did not prove to be significant determinants of students' views were whether or not they voted in the 2010 elections, their distance from the Yard, how many classes they had in the Yard, whether they were international, their financial aid status, and whether they had read Occupy Harvard's "Statement of Principles."
The survey group said that although nonresponse bias did affect the results of the survey to some extent, as people with strong opinions on the issue were more likely to respond, they still hypothesize that the ratings gathered from the dataset are indicative of the general attitudes of Harvard students.
In response to the possibility of nonresponse bias, the surveyors sought to increase response rates in Pennypacker and Quincy, in hopes that comparing the general responses to a subset with less nonresponse bias would give insight into the effect of the bias.
They used tabling, personalized e-mails, and gift card incentives to drive up response rate, and found that the results from those residences were very similar to those of the entire dataset. "Our tests show that the mean of our 1,000-plus person sample was very similar to the subsets from Quincy and Pennypacker," George said. "So we think that they should be a pretty accurate representation of feelings on campus."
Still, George emphasized that only around one-sixth of the undergraduate student body participated. "While we can speculate about the Harvard population as a whole, this result only speaks for the students who responded," George wrote in an email.
