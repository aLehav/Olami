After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On April 20, President Donald J. Trump tweeted that in light of the growing COVID-19 pandemic, he would “temporarily suspend immigration into the United States.” As a recently graduated international student, I asked myself whether I should worry more about my health or my visa status.
On June 22, the President suspended H-1B work visas for overseas applicants. My international friends and I anxiously texted each other with a shared sense that we had just dodged a bullet because we were not overseas, but we braced for what more might come. Then, on July 6, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released new guidelines requiring international students to leave the country if their universities planned to hold classes online. Dozens of my foreign friends and family panicked, fearful of having to leave school indefinitely in the middle of a global pandemic.
Thanks to lawsuits from Harvard and MIT as well as several states, ICE reversed its exclusionary policies on July 14. International students are safe for now. But we still fear that assaults on our visa status will come in waves, much like the pandemic itself.
Precarity is nothing new to many immigrant groups in the United States. But for many under the F-1 student visa and H-1B worker visa, the assault on our status came as a shock. After all, international students added $40 billion to the U.S. economy in 2019 and created or supported nearly 460,000 jobs in the 2018-2019 school year. There was little economic and policy rationale to target us.
Many of us may have felt we were secure because the Trump administration unveiled a plan last year to prioritize “merit-based” immigration over family-based “chain migration.” This kind of system would give preference to highly-educated, younger, English-speaking immigrants. Unsurprisingly, the immigrants that would get preference may support these merit-based policies more.
But as more recent policies have made clear, it is a false assumption among many international students at elite universities and high-income immigrants that our visa status is meaningfully “different” from those under Temporary Protected Status, asylum, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or those who are undocumented. The word “different” betrays an assumption that our education and professions make us uniquely meritorious and deserving. “Different” may also veil racism and xenophobia toward immigrants from certain countries. For example, many of us may not have acted at the outset of the “Muslim ban” in 2017, when President Trump signed an executive order barring entry of people from seven Muslim-majority countries.
The language of “difference” in immigration is costly. It has allowed many to remain silent even in the face of inhumane and predatory immigration enforcement against certain racial and working-class groups.
It is time to reframe our immigration narrative. All of us face the threat of xenophobia. All of us feel like pawns in political games. Therefore, all of us need to fight for each other.
As a Nepali, I can see that true immigration justice requires solidarities across different immigration categories. Nepal is a small South Asian country of just 28 million people, but the Nepali community has traveled all immigration pathways. Nepal has more than 13,000 college students in the United States, nearly 9,000 workers under TPS and, since 2008, more than 26,500 permanent residents with Diversity Immigrant Visas, a category that grants residency to people from underrepresented countries. I know Nepalis who have degrees from the country’s top universities; those who are doctors at the frontlines of COVID-19; others who got a Diversity Visa and reunited with loved ones after years of living apart; and students who have worked multiple jobs to afford out-of-state tuition that ultimately subsidize costs for their American peers. No matter what our pathway to this country, all of us have relied on the promise of America.
Students are privileged that states and universities mobilized on their behalf. But more is at stake. The U.S. government has proposed new definitions and procedures for asylum-seekers that would effectively end the status for all but very few. Only one day after the Supreme Court protected DACA under narrow grounds, President Trump signaled that he might attempt to terminate it again. The future of TPS is also uncertain, with an appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit and a stagnant bill that could provide TPS holders with an opportunity for permanent residency. We must mobilize in support of those who don’t have universities and employers behind them.
Let us not use our privileges as international students or high-skilled workers to further entrench the immigration hierarchy. Let us rethink our toleration of a punitive immigration system. This administration is dividing us. It is time we build solidarities instead — across class and borders.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 20 percent of Harvard College students do not intend to enroll this fall, according to data provided in a Thursday email from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay to faculty and staff.
Roughly 5,231 undergraduates intend to enroll this fall, Gay wrote. Though figures vary slightly each year, Common Data Set filings from last year showed Harvard had 6,755 enrolled undergraduates.
340 freshmen deferred their enrollment to next year, representing more than 20 percent of the freshman class. Between 80 and 110 students take a gap year under typical circumstances, according to the College’s website.
In July, Harvard announced all undergraduate classes would be held virtually and invited first-year students to live in the dorms. Several weeks later, the College clarified that due to federal visa restrictions, international freshmen would not be able to come to campus.
Harvard also asked upperclassmen to seek approval to return, estimating that up to 40 percent of all undergraduates would be able to live in the dorms. The FAS now projects that only 25 percent of students will live on campus.
Of the 5,231 undergraduates who intend to enroll this fall, the majority — 3,599 students — will learn remotely, while 1,168 freshmen and 464 upperclassmen will live in residence, according to Gay.
“While our plan prepared us for as many as 40% of our typical undergraduate population learning in residence, we are currently anticipating a residential cohort size of closer to 25% based on the number of students who have accepted our invitation to learn on campus,” Gay wrote.
Gay noted that more than 1,000 students who face challenges learning remotely were invited back to campus. Harvard made spots available to students who lacked a sufficient computer, fast internet, a quiet place to work, or unhindered time to commit to coursework; those who faced challenging home and family circumstances or shelter and food insecurities; and those who require accessible learning resources or technology on campus.
Though FAS was able to project how many students intend to enroll, Gay wrote that it could not yet project how many students the Administrative Board will grant leaves of absence.
“The Administrative Board is reviewing requests for Leaves of Absence on a rolling basis and it would be premature to provide an estimate of expected leaves at this time,” she wrote.
Undergraduates can request a leave of absence until Dec. 4, though they may be charged a fee or portion of tuition after Sept. 9.
The College previously announced it would not change its rules regarding leaves of absence, but, under existing policy, unenrolled students are barred from participating in campus activities and using most Harvard resources.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Rhode Island man was sentenced to 21 months in prison and three years of supervised release Wednesday for sending dozens of violent, threatening emails to a Massachusetts professor reportedly affiliated with Harvard.
North Kingstown, R.I. resident Matthew Haviland, 30, pleaded guilty to one count of stalking and two counts of transmitting a threat in interstate commerce last September.
Haviland was arrested in April 2019 after FBI agents traced 28 emails to him that threatened to rape, kill, dismember, and eat the unnamed professor, according to an affidavit in the case. The emails were all sent on the evening of March 10, 2019 and several appeared to be motivated by the professor’s public support of abortion and criticism of President Donald Trump.
Another email threatened to “kill every Democrat in the world” to prevent abortions.
Five days later, Haviland sent 12 emails to the admissions department of one of the professional schools at the professor’s university, accusing it of racism against white people and threatening to bomb the school. He also admitted to leaving 114 voice messages at an abortion clinic in Rhode Island in which he compared a doctor there to Nazis, according to the affidavit.
Haviland’s attorney, Ian Gold, declined to comment on the sentence Thursday morning.
After Haviland’s arrest, several Boston media outlets reported that the recipient of the macabre emails was a male Harvard faculty member, though the victim is only identified in court documents as a professor who works at a Massachusetts university.
According to the affidavit, the professor told a police detective that they were used to hate mail, but was “very fearful” for themselves and their family as a result of Haviland’s emails.
“[Haviland’s] gruesome missives … induced nightmares, interfered with my life by flooding my mind for months with unwanted images, made my teaching more challenging, frightened … my family as well as my faculty assistant, and caused enormous distress,” the victim wrote in a sentencing memorandum last fall. “Haviland’s vivid threats and the rage they expressed continue to haunt me.”
Though Haviland had no prior criminal record, a forensic psychiatrist determined Haviland posed a “moderate risk of both targeted violence and affective violence were he to be released from detention without supervision,” according to the memorandum.
U.S. District Judge Leo T. Sorokin’s sentence Wednesday matched the government’s recommended sentence as part of the plea agreement.
“The Constitution protects everyone’s right to free speech, but there is a hard line between free speech and the stalking and harassment committed in this case,” U.S. Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a release. “My office will enforce that line.”
Haviland’s case is not the only recent instance of offensive emails sent to University affiliates. In June, the FBI launched an investigation into a separate racist email sent to thousands of affiliates at Harvard, Stanford, and the University of Michigan amid nationwide protests against racial injustice.
