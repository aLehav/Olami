After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Feb. 2, Paul Rudd, Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ Man of the Year, received the famed Pudding Pot in an event he likened to “a Terrence Malick movie.” During the press conference, Rudd commented on his comic origins which—despite co-writing the “Ant Man” movies—did not start with Marvel.
“I grew up not reading Marvel comics,” Rudd said. “I had a few, I read them occasionally, but I was not a big comic book fan.”
Rudd read other stories instead. “The American comics that I read growing up were Archie and, like, Jughead. I read a lot of the laugh digests,” Rudd said. “My parents are both British and I used to get a lot of British comics, well ‘a lot’ too, one called Beano and one called Dandy.
“My cousins would send them to me and I was really into those,” Rudd said. “Superheroes, not so much. So writing is a totally new and fascinating journey.”
During the roast, the “Ant Man” was accused of making a deal with the devil to retain his signature youthful features by the “grim reaper” and was challenged to perform the timeless “RSVP” monologue from the 1995 movie “Clueless” in Robert De Niro’s accent.
The members of the Hasty Pudding ridiculed the actor for the lack of diversity in the roles he has played, listing “likable dad, lovable dad, bar mitzvah DJ” as some of the examples. Rudd expressed his gratitude for receiving the Pudding Pot, promising to place it on his shelf next to his non-existent Oscar and Golden Globe, and his very much existent “Fun Fearless Man” award, conferred by Cosmopolitan magazine.
Rudd truly earned his title of a fearless man, however, by commenting on the 2018 Superbowl game. “I am not a Patriots fan and I hope they lose,” Rudd bluntly declared, despite being mere miles away from the center of Boston. However, he was extremely enthusiastic about another aspect of New England sports—“Filming at Fenway was one of the greatest day I’ve had in my life,” he said on playing the baseball player and WW2 spy Moe Berg.
Rudd also extensively commented on his experiences in Boston and at Harvard: “Seeing the buildings was very moving.” He described the tradition of the university as a comforting presence: “It puts you in your place and it makes you feel a little bit smaller, because this has been going on for a lot longer than you have.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I. Enemies of enemies are not friends.
What outsiders seem not to know about New Jersey’s apparent shift to Republicanism when former Governor Chris Christie was elected nine years ago was the amount of points he gained for not being his predecessor, Jon Corzine. Corzine was the former CEO of Goldman Sachs; Christie was a local lawyer. Corzine apparently tried to sell the Turnpike; Christie was trying to convince people that overweight was not equivalent to overindulgent. Corzine tried to increase the sales tax rate; Christie was into lowering property taxes. The apparent inevitability of a Christie election was palpable even to my seventh-grade self—as my government, biology, and English teachers implored us to convince our parents to vote for the third-party Chris Daggett—anybody but Christie, who was bound to cut our township’s funding by millions of dollars in favor of charter schools.
Christie was one of our high school’s alumni, and our town also had a school named after a Kushner. “How could you trust someone,” my middle school government teacher said, “willing to just turn on his own hometown like that?” Our middle school class went on long tangents about how we wanted control over our own government, doodled anti-Christie-Corzine drawings on our Converses, and complained day and night to our parents as our teachers did to us. When Christie decided to announce his run for presidency at our high school years later, I watched as teachers and students who despised him hold pro-Christie signs while rolling their eyes, and we laughed and laughed at the footage after Christie became Trump’s Gretchen.
II. Buy local.
Political pessimism runs deep in New Jersey blood; cynicism is the antidote. Newark’s “supermayor” Cory Booker attempted to turn back a long tide of poverty, entrepreneurial exodus, and crime through business, development, and most of all, cheeriness: He wanted Newark residents to hope again. He saved neighbors from burning buildings, helped temporarily homeless dogs, and shoveled sidewalks. It seemed obvious, however, as we watched Booker prepare for higher offices, that symbolism, not true investment in Newark, was his motivation behind the mayoral post. Booker widely publicized an opening of one Whole Foods store in Newark to provide a minimal number of jobs for local residents while paying consultants thousands of dollars a day from reform funds to assess school districts.
He announced large education reforms on Oprah, which “played disastrously in the community,” who neither knew before about these reforms nor had input into how these reforms were to happen, but resonated brilliantly nationally. He placed an unofficial minimum of $10 million gifted annually for membership on the Foundation for Newark’s Future to help wealthy donors decide what to do with the city. Local actors who had once supported his campaign, citing his absenteeism,  said that they felt like a stepping stone on his run to higher offices.
III. There is always a cloud before the storm.
Perhaps, as New Jersey native Anthony Bourdain stated on his show "Parts Unknown," the best prophecy of our country is the snapshot of Trump’s Taj Mahal established in 1983, out of place in a hurricane-touched and stinted Atlantic City. Trump had once been the hope of Atlantic City too, promising then to bring booming times back one quick flamboyant casino at a time, crossing the finish line in 2014 with bankruptcy.
IV. Classical dichotomies exist.
I went off to Harvard after high school; my best friend went off to Yale. Last November, the night before the Game, we sat in one of the bedrooms of an ugly two-story house while the wet wood floor beat with the deep-deep-down-inside part of Kanye’s “Fade,” whose remix was scratched and scored by an anonymous skinny white boy. The mirror seemed cracked as if punched through, and some book by Joan Didion laid mean on the dusty dresser. The house smelled faintly like a cat. Outside, someone yelled over and over again that they were gonna make the school pay, and I wanted to ask for what. Rivalry seemed especially meaningless then, and when we made our way out of the rank two-stories, I saw in my best friend the quiet yellow girl that came before her and the even quieter one that came before her.
Our shared town took up negative space between us. She insisted we were sheltered, but in truth, we lived in a liberal nightmare of a place. Our senior year, after Ferguson, a white boy named Tevlin got shot by a black man in an act of admitted public execution for all the lives of color taken by Americans in the Middle East. Later, the president of our high school Gay-Straight Alliance chapter came out as straight and showed off his new girlfriend while his ex-boyfriend sulked in the corner. Then, our town’s equivalent of a soccer mom sued Harvard, but not before another boy’s parents sued Princeton for the same reason almost a decade before. It means something, I told her, to have lived somewhere so upside-down.
V. TL;DR.
Perhaps the best conclusion I can give from these nostalgic parables of local governance is that symbolic gestures are meaningless. Our insistence that they matter works on a level of operation that is simply too easy. And when self-interest is involved, we hurt most the ones that were initially promised help.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As The Crimson reported Tuesday, 17 students declared their candidacy for the Undergraduate Council’s spring midterm elections this year, marking a precipitous drop in the number of students seeking a seat on the Council. Last year, 27 students ran in the spring midterms, and 35 ran the spring before that.
This lack of student interest in running for UC positions may, as we have previously opined, be due to the failure of the Council to serve as a vehicle for change on this campus. In the meantime, students have become engaged in other extracurricular organizations that have stepped in to fill this gap. The many different programming boards on campus, from the First-Year Social Committee to the House Committees and the College Events Board have provided students with the spaces, events, and support that the UC has not.
Similarly, various affinity groups on campus have also created important communities for students on campus. The Undergraduate Council no longer plays a meaningful role in improving student life; instead, it has been reduced to the role of a financier that funds organizations that do. We believe the decline of student interest in joining the Undergraduate Council may be attributed in part to other campus groups taking on a much more active role in improving campus life.
We do not doubt that the UC is working hard to improve student life at Harvard. Although we have qualms about the UC’s effectiveness as a whole, we appreciate the efforts that individual students are taking to improve the body. We particularly appreciate the work that is being done in response to the referendum that students passed supporting the establishment of a physical space for belonging.
We also commend the UC for changing the voting platform for this spring’s elections, which will certainly improve student engagement in voting. Indeed, having a voting platform that is easier to navigate bodes well for democracy at Harvard. Additionally, we eagerly anticipate the establishment of the UC progress bar, which will hold the body accountable as it seeks to implement election promises. Its introduction will serve as an important step forward in publicizing the UC’s initiatives and progress to students.
Nevertheless, we believe student disinterest in the UC persists despite the UC’s efforts because the Council has historically done a poor job of publicizing its actions, achievements, and elections. Although the UC organizes and funds events across campus, and bolsters other initiatives, it struggles to effectively communicate its accomplishments to the student body. Furthermore, although the UC has been transparent by opening their meetings to the student body, it has not effectively publicized these meetings or systematically encouraged students to attend.
That we feel compelled to keep writing editorials lamenting the same issue—that students are disengaged from the UC—is extremely regrettable. Despite our continuous calls for change, the UC has been unable to improve its ability to communicate its agenda to the student body. The continuous decline in student engagement in the UC represents a systematic problem with the Council that cannot be solved by a simple change of leadership.
Despite our frustration with the UC’s ability to engage students in its work, we still encourage students to vote and participate in the midterm elections. We believe that an active and empowered UC, if it existed, could serve as a focal point and platform for students to communicate their needs to the administration. Still, we need students to continue voting and attempting to initiate serious, systematic change to reach that point.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In University President Drew G. Faust’s final semester, Harvard would seem like an interdisciplinary utopia. Driven by the “One Harvard” campaign, said to merge Harvard’s academic units into a larger academic community, students from every school fill course-preview classrooms to the brim.
But the fantasy ends there. After applying to cross-register into another Harvard school, a logistical hell awaits students, rendering cross-registration nearly impossible. Despite Harvard’s ceaseless promotion of “One Harvard,” when it comes to taking classes outside one’s school, it’s as if “One Harvard” never existed.
With few exceptions, whomever you ask, you’ll hear cross-registration horror stories. During shopping week this spring, a friend in the Graduate School of Education attended a total of eight courses at four different schools, with slim chances of getting accepted. A different friend attended a course preview at the Kennedy School, where the professor asked all cross-registrants to kindly leave the room since there was never enough space for non-Kennedy students. I personally petitioned to enroll in nine different courses outside of my school, and felt lucky when I got on the waitlist for just one. Even students who never attempted to cross-register have heard the rumors that it’s easier to register to MIT or Tufts than to a different Harvard unit.
The difficulty with cross-registration lies within dysfunctional Harvard school policies. Schools like the Law School, Kennedy School, and Business School often give their own students priority seats before considering out-of-school candidates. Other schools without formal cross-registration policies but limited class availability usually do the same. As a result, cross-registrants must wait until just moments before the registration deadlines to know if they have been accepted. If a class caps enrollment, they usually aren’t.
To make things worse, each school follows their own registration calendar, often with little to no communication between schools. Though relatively simple to resolve, poor communication has chronically plagued cross-registration; an op-ed written nearly a decade ago describes strikingly similar problems. For example, while students of the School of Public Health campaign for a seat in class in early December, students of the Graduate School of Education begin course shopping in January, long after all seats at the School of Public Health have been claimed.
In my and dozens of others' experience, the sum of all this looks like the following: You obsessively check course offerings at every school as soon as they become available. Once you’ve made a list of potential courses, you launch a massive e-mail campaign to their instructors, making sure to pad your qualifications and highlight how much you need this course. During course previews, you huddle up with other fellow cross-registrants, and you collectively calculate your chances of getting in based on the school’s policies and deadlines. Finally, you make a multi-layer contingency plan for all in-school and out-of-school courses you have applied for, and pray that it all somehow falls into place. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t, and then you’re back to square one, looking for last-minute in-school courses that accept students past the original deadline.
Why, then, does Harvard keep making this empty promise? It’s time to face the fact that, for many, cross-registration remains a selling point, a “you can study anything at Harvard” line in recruitment brochures that actively fails in practice. It’s a broken system, yet it claims that it works because students have the “right” to get rejected from everywhere beyond their own disciplines.
The arguable cornerstone of "One Harvard," cross-registration, has long failed to live up to expectations, and without it, its entire premise has been undermined. Harvard can never dream of seamless, rich, cross-disciplinary collaboration if it constricts students to their individual academic bubbles. In the words of Faust herself, to answer our world’s most pressing questions, “students and faculty must be enabled to draw easily on Harvard’s widely distributed strengths.”
This argument does not ask for schools to prioritize other students over their own. Certainly, when degrees require specific courses, and when certain courses require particularly skilled students, it makes sense to limit cross-registration. But keeping cross-registrants floating in limbo defies the “One Harvard” message. It supplants curiosity and innovation with bitter resignation. Understandably, anyone who has experienced the stress and disappointment of cross-registration will spare themselves the agony next semester and cling to their own school.
It’s too late for students in the 2017-18 academic year and those who pursue yearlong degrees. However, we must urge Faust’s successor to make much-needed changes to the cross-registration system in the following years. If they turn their gaze towards instances of successful cross-registration, they will find some common themes: stratified lotteries. Reserved seats to ensure space for cross-registrants. Open enrollment, multiple sections, and joint offerings to meet demand. Timely, well-communicated deadlines and notification of enrollment. And more importantly, in these classes they will find a diverse group of students collaborating, thinking deeply, and meeting their true potential. Isn’t that what Harvard’s all about?
While individual professors sometimes adopt more relaxed registration practices for their classes, it’s now time for administrative action. Harvard can still deliver on their promise of interdisciplinary education without sacrificing a whole lot. Only this time, cross-registration must work as advertised: for all students, not just those who get lucky.

“Your word is porwigle.”
A pause. “Porwigle?” I asked. “May I have the definition please?”
“A tadpole.”
“May I have the language of origin?”
“English, from Middle English.”
“May I have any alternate pronunciations?”
“There are none, just”—now it’s his turn to pause—“porwigle.” The pronouncer’s enunciation is drawn out, the word round and inscrutable between his lips. Redness (where does it come from?) bathes the stage. The timer ticks down; thirty seconds remain, I think it means to say.
Flashing cameras crouch in front of the stage, their shutters clicking. They sense uncertainty. The hundreds in the auditorium do too, and their hush presses in on me. The work of eleven months is suspended in these final few seconds. I moisten my lips:
“P-O-R-W-I-G—
***
A flurry of whistles. “Hey Frankie,” bellowed the head coach as I sprinted, clumsily, for a pass. “I heard you can spell.” The ball toggled from hand to hand, back again, and dropped to the green.
Four days after the Finals of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, I was running through drills. No, not root-word exercises. Not etymology practice. Football drills. As in, running-and-catching-and-hitting-things drills. As in, a complete 180 from the orthographic bliss of just a few days before.
As in, the last thing I’d want to be doing.
The Scripps National Spelling Bee limits participation to students in the eighth grade or under. But this was the summer before my freshman year of high school. Spelling was just a thing I did—a middle-school eccentricity, no?
“There is a time for all things under the sun, and a season for every activity under the heavens” intones Ecclesiastes 3.1 (my high school was Jesuit), and ninth grade was the season for reinvention. Freshman football seemed like a logical first step: nothing like hot, plasticky turf and sweaty jockstraps to fill the vowel-shaped void left by the bee.
From that day on, I was the spelling-bee kid. And I fucking loved it.
I became a mascot of sorts on the football team: the nice-guy teddy-bear offensive tackle who had been on prime-time ESPN…but to spell. It was as though my parents had bought me a FastPass at Disney World, and without any direct effort on my part I was flying up the social ladder. Well…a social ladder. Mine wasn’t the true one, reserved for the charmed few. But my ladder ran parallel, and I was perched at the top. I was the kid everyone loved—never the one you’d invite to a party, but so what? “Awkwardly aloof” was my modus operandi, and (somehow) it worked. Who’d have known that the linguistic skeletons in my closet could so easily substitute for, say, social skills and emotional intelligence and a healthy sense of self?
So, with little incentive to do otherwise, identity-formation was put on hold. I played the humble servant of Christ—“No, no Mrs. X, it wasn’t my best work, but thank you, thank you”—but all the while, I craved the praise. I thrived on it, taking every chance to trot out the endangered beasts in my now-defunct lexicon. My writing became illegibly pretentious. Consider the following, featured in a short story written for my freshman English class:
They discussed their respective societies: their unique solutions to a schismatic societal Kulturkampf long since abolished in both cultures, the lengths at which each leader had gone to in order to halt dégringolade within their now-cohesive communities, and the inevitable eventuality that Götterdӓmmerung would envelop all peoples in its seemingly innocuous retrogressive embrace.
In translation: “I know so many words, and by God, you will know it too.” Q.E.D.
I would like to say I grew out of this habit. That by high-school graduation the crucifixes studding the walls in each and every classroom had stirred in me epiphany, the stuff of a Hollywood sports biopic or a Christian feel-good miracle-flick. But to be good at spelling is to excel at repetition.
***
“Your word is lozenge.”
I robotically go through the standard questions, all too aware of my friends at the back of the cramped classroom. A few of them have crafted signs for the occasion: billboards reading “STELLAR SPELLER” in striped block letters.
“Lozenge?”
It’s visiting weekend for freshmen parents at Harvard, and my mom is in the audience.
“Lozenge.”
The convergence of this situation is too much.
“Lozenge.” The letters fall out: “L-O-S-E-N-G-E.” Someone rings an absurdly large bell, and benumbed I exit, ousted in the second round and disproportionately devastated.
***
I understand the logic: it was a tried and true formula. And repetition was an old hat. Based on my sample size of one, it was clear that once again becoming the ‘spelling-bee kid’ would be the key to clawing my way up the Harvard College social ladder. Like many freshmen, I felt lost in the noise, yearning for some kind—any kind— of distinction. It’s still so vivid…the recollections of slyly talking up the intramural spelling bee to my friends, dropping subtle hints about my past and feigning embarrassment when they discovered the videos or read the articles. (To be fair, I was more embarrassed at my own need for validation and readiness to manipulate others in order to obtain it). It was all so silly: a spelling bee thrown by, of all entities, the Freshman Dean’s Office; a room of 20 first-years who, beyond the intramural points at stake, couldn’t care less about the whole affair; an audience of parents and friends dragged along, duly supportive but thinking of the cool, autumn day awaiting them at the event’s conclusion. And then there was me, whose entire world hinged upon the thing.
But being the speller was easy: I preferred to be defined by a single-story.
***
—G-L-E. Porwigle.”
Even now, thinking back on those days (2012 feels an age away), I’m awash with a sweet nostalgia. I don’t think I have ever loved anything so much as I loved studying for the bee. The marathon cram-sessions with my coach, the dust-laden pages of my Schnauzer-sized dictionary, the thousands and thousands of words, in all their whimsy, their mysterious and lovely variety.
Even the 20-plus hours spent most weekends in a cubicle at my dad’s office, studying anything from Sanskrit spelling patterns to words for cheese (of which there are shockingly many). I even gained 60 lbs in the process (a simple outcome, really: quitting sports for a year to study + stress-eating whilst enacting said studying = dramatic weight gain), but it was worth even that.
Even now I miss it. The drafty convention centers and the cutthroat competitiveness. The joy of victory and the ever-present imminence of loss. The thrill of academic success in high school and the disbelief of admission to Harvard—these have in no way compared to that raw sense of success I merited at the bee. Spelling sparked an epic love affair with language, a lavish romance beginning with Latin that is still honeymooning today.
Even now—
“The art of losing isn’t hard to master,” American poet Elizabeth Bishop chants, though I don’t believe it. Regardless, through loss after loss—the “seemingly innocuous retrogressive embrace” of  an unwilled “dégringolade”—we persevere. Even the villanelle, so bent on repetition, after 19 lines must end.
Even a tadpole must metamorphose: watch the gentle nubs of translucent arms and legs poke out and the tail absorb into the body, the mouth widen and the head change shape. See the gills fail. See the frog’s first gasping breath at the water’s surface.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruiqi He ’19 won re-election to the Undergraduate Council after a revote Friday in Leverett House, according to Election Commission Chair Jubin Gorji ’21.  The revote was needed given no candidates in Leverett reached the necessary threshold during last week’s midterm election to be declared the outright winner.
UC elections follow the Hare-Clark voting system, a ranked voting method in which each candidate must reach a certain vote quota to be elected. He, the former UC secretary, was the only candidate to declare her candidacy for the open seat in Leverett. But Benjamin I. Sorkin ’20, a former UC representative, garnered enough votes as a write-in option to prevent any candidate from reaching the threshold.
The revote saw unusually high turnout for a non-presidential UC election, with 120 students in Leverett casting ballots compared to just 57 who voted in the original election last week.
Sorkin said in an interview before the runoff that he was “peeved” another round of voting was necessary, given he outpaced He in first, second, and third place votes in the original vote count. Last week, Sorkin said he ran as a write-in after not being informed of the open seat in the House.
This year’s midterm election was the first to use the Council’s new election software.  Gorji said Sunday that the Commission received no complaints about the new system this week, a stark contrast from the numerous voting issues that plagued November’s presidential elections.
Ruiqi He did not respond to request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Science will likely vote on a proposal to amend current guidelines for the College’s Advanced Standing program at their monthly meeting this week.
The proposal, last introduced by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris at the December Faculty meeting, will make it more difficult for students to receive college credit for courses taken prior to matriculating. If passed, the proposal will begin affecting students in the class of 2023.
Previously, students had to apply to the Advanced Standing program using Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credits and had the option of either graduating in three years or pursuing a master’s degree in their fourth year. The new program would make all students eligible for Advanced Standing.
To earn the master's degree, students must apply to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in their junior year and “complete all requirements for both degrees without reduction” in the eight semesters at Harvard, eight credits of which will count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degree.
If passed, students would still be able to use Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate examinations for placement, at the discretion of departments, and for meeting the 2-semester language requirement in place for all undergraduates.
Faculty raised several concerns about the proposal at the last Faculty meeting in December. Some said they were worried students would be unable to complete an undergraduate degree and a master’s in four years. Computer Science professor Michael D. Mitzenmacher ’91 said the new program may affect his department’s ability to recruit students.
The proposal would disproportionately affect concentrators in the Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, divisions that see the most Advanced Standing applicants.
Last December, several students said that they were not aware of the proposal and that the recommendations surprised them. Some professors also warned that the new proposal could drive top students to peer institutions like Stanford, where advanced standing programs are significantly more popular.
At the faculty meeting on Tuesday, Claudine Gay, divisional dean of social science, will also report on the progress of the Inequality in America Initiative, first launched last October.

The Hasty Pudding Theatricals honored Paul Rudd as Man of the Year Friday evening with the troupe’s Pudding Pot and a celebrity roast.
The Pudding selects an actor for Man of the Year who has had a significant and lasting impact in the entertainment world. Rudd is widely known for his performance in films, such as “Ant-Man,” which he also co-wrote. He has also starred in many movies, including “Clueless,” “They Came Together,” and “The 40-Year Old Virgin.”
Cast members of the Pudding Theatricals performed a celebrity roast for Rudd, poking fun at what they called his agelessness as well as his acting career. Each character in the roast skit set Rudd a specific challenge to prove himself worthy of the Pot.
At one point, Eric J. Cheng '20—dressed as the character Sex Panther in a tight, black bodysuit—tested Rudd’s seduction techniques. After Cheng showed Rudd how to strut and “rawr,” Rudd briefly danced in a suggestive manner with Sex Panther.
Pudding cast members also played other characters like Death, William Shakespeare, Thor, the Hulk, Captain America, and the Canadian band Rush, who asked Rudd to perform a one minute air-guitar and air-drum solo of their song “Tom Sawyer.”
Eventually, two Pudding cast members emerged and handed Rudd the Pot, kissing him on both cheeks as they did so. Rudd then thanked the audience and the Pudding for what he said felt like an extraordinary honor. He added he was happy to be on campus and said he really enjoyed visiting Harvard.
In a press conference following the roast, Rudd said he particularly admires the University's long history.
“Whenever you’re standing in a place that has real history, that’s been around for hundreds of years, it has a way of making you feel sane,” Rudd said, describing his ventures through the Yard. “It puts you in your place, and it makes all your problems seem a little bit smaller because this has been going on for a lot longer than I have.”
After the press conference ended, Rudd watched the opening night production of the Pudding’s show, “Intermission Impossible.” Before leaving the press conference, though, Rudd donned a Pudding-made Ant-Man style bra that he sported in several pictures.
“It’s a nice fit,” Rudd said, as Pudding cast enveloped him in a red and silver, sparkly chestpiece.
The Pudding Theatricals recently honored Woman of the Year Mila Kunis with a parade and celebrity roast. Before Kunis’s roast, Pudding President Amira T. Weeks ’18 announced the troupe will allow women to join men as cast members on stage next year, breaking more than 100 years of tradition.

Sarah E. Lewis ’01, a Harvard scholar of race, art and contemporary culture, took over the Instagram account of the New Yorker Photo Department in late January to teach viewers about the relationship between photography and culture.
Lewis, an assistant professor of African and African American studies and of history of art and architecture, teaches the General Education course History of Art and Architecture 176e: “Vision and Justice: The Art of Citizenship.” Lewis said students in her course explore the power of visual culture in defining who is included in both American and international societies.
“I hope they leave far more empowered to believe and understand that they can create the images that can author their own identities and will be far more sensitive to those of others,” Lewis said.
For each day of her four-day long takeover, Lewis posted pictures meant to be compelling and thought-provoking for a digital audience, including portraits of famous figures like Frederick Douglass, John F. Kennedy ’40, and Martin Luther King Jr. Each one has a connection to the current day, she said.
“The New Yorker has a photography editor, Siobhán Bohnacker, who wrote an email to me asking me if I would take over the New Yorker’s Instagram account,” Lewis said, describing how the opportunity surfaced. “It came out of the blue.”
Lewis said she was reluctant to accept at first because she did not know how to make the takeover align with her goals to teach through photos. She said she realized the takeover comprised an opportunity to reach a bigger audience.
“We can all look at an image, say of racial terror like Eric Garner’s killing, and be outraged but not move to action because we all think someone else might be doing something,” Lewis said. “With this takeover, I thought about how could I reframe these images so they do have a potency, so that they do affect you.”
One of the first pictures Lewis posted was of a young boy, Jacob Philadelphia, touching the hair of former President Barack Obama. She said that, in this image, the boy is seeing that the texture of the president’s hair matches his own.
“Here you have this idea that you really can’t become what you can’t imagine, what you can’t see,” said Lewis. “You have to ask yourself what has culture presented to him at the age of five already such that he needs confirmation that his dreams are valid, that he can rise, ultimately, to become the most powerful person in the United States, running the country.”
Lewis said much of her inspiration and passion stem from her grandfather’s experience in the 1920s. He was expelled from high school for asking why the template for success always looked one way and was missing narratives of non-white success, she said.
“Citizenship in the United States is defined in 1790 as whiteness, being male, being able to hold property,” Lewis said. “The current-day definition is far more vast and broad.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Harvard withdrew an application to extend construction hours on the Smith Campus Center as the renovation project nears its second year, the building will still be completed on time, according to the University.
The University filed an application in November to lengthen construction hours. The Cambridge License Commission, however, postponed a vote on the matter in December while the University continued to discuss the impacts of extending construction hours with local businesses.
But Harvard has now decided not to pursue the application. Despite the lack of extra construction hours, the project will still open on time in the fall, according to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
“Harvard chose not to pursue a variance,” O’Rourke wrote in an email. “The project remains on schedule.”
The renovations to the Smith Campus Center have posed several challenges to neighboring businesses around the construction site. One restaurant, En Boca, filed a lawsuit alleging the University misrepresented the scope of its renovations. The restaurant has also blamed Harvard's construction for its closure in June 2017, eight months after opening.
Last October, Tanya Iatridis, senior director of University Planning, said she expects the Center to open in September 2018. When complete, the building will feature new restaurants, a renovated arcade, and a top floor bar. Harvard first began renovations for the campus center in April 2016 after receiving a donation of an undisclosed amount.
Many students said they were excited by the prospect of shared space the renovated campus center will provide.
“There’s really right now no space for students to congregate outside of the houses,” Brandon N. Wachs ’18 said. “Having somewhere that’s central to meet that’s not a library, that’s not a restaurant, but that’s by Harvard would be really nice.”
Isabel R. Steinhaus ’18 said she feels jealous of the students who will be around when the center opens, given construction will not end before the Class of 2018 graduates. “I’m a senior, so I’m actually a little bummed because I thought it was initially going to open in the spring of 2018,” she said.
“I’m really excited about the food, I’m jealous that everyone else is going to get the chance to have some,” Steinhaus added.
The Smith Center is expected to house roughly eight food vendors, but Wachs said he has reservations about the potential affordability of these establishments.
“I think price point is really important, especially when you look at the Square and what’s left and potentially what could be coming in,” Wachs said. “The Square, to a large degree, does price people out depending on their socioeconomic status, which you don’t want at a school.”
“I think for the restaurants they put in there it would be crucial that they take BoardPlus or Crimson Cash,” he added.
The opening of the campus center has already had some effect on local residents. Due to the constant disruptive noise caused by the early morning construction, College administrators purchased white noise machines and sets of noise-cancelling headphones for freshmen living in Apley Court.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Contradicting earlier statements, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana repeatedly declined to say when the College will release a final plan to enforce its social group penalties in an interview Friday.
The sanctions—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
Khurana said in Dec. 2017 that the College planned to finalize a plan for enforcing the penalties by the start of this semester. On Friday, he specified that the Office of Student Life has been “charged with the implementation” of the sanctions and will debut the enforcement mechanism to students.
Asked twice when the Office plans to publish the plan, Khurana did not directly answer. He said the Office has not yet published the enforcement mechanism because it is still finalizing the details.
“Our focus is to really get this right. I think it’s important,” he said. “Obviously we’re not going to get everything right the whole time.”
The Office of Student Life could continue to tweak the recommendations even after staffers send the plan to students, Khurana said.
“It would be great to have a detailed blueprint but [we’re] probably going to have to—once we get the framework—continue to work as we sort of adjust specific issues and questions come up,” he said.
Khurana also repeatedly declined to detail the specifics of the College’s plan for implementing the sanctions. Instead, he pointed to previous reports produced by two separate committees, each charged with reviewing the policy.
Khurana said he will look to recommendations from one of the two committees in particular. That report suggested the College’s Honor Council should help enforce the sanctions and that all-female groups should have a five-year grace period to go gender neutral. It also suggested the College should consider barring members of single-gender groups from leadership roles in both the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson as well as all other recognized student groups.
Khurana declined to answer questions asking whether the Office of Student Life’s enforcement plan will follow these exact recommendations. As he said in Dec. 2017, Khurana said the final plan will seek to advance “the spirit of the policy.”
“Again, I think, in the coming period you will hear all the details around those specific questions,” he said.
Khurana said that—even though the Office of Student Life has yet to release its plan—he thinks students “are pretty clear about what the policy is.” He added he thinks students understand which social groups are still subject to the sanctions and which are not.
“The implementation committee and the faculty committee reports actually, if you look at them, are pretty clear about the organizations, the social organizations,” he said.
In December, Khurana said he was aware students might be confused about the policy and that he hoped to clear up any uncertainty as soon as possible.
“We ask people’s patience while we make sure that we send clear information and clear guidelines,” he said at the time. “We can’t answer all questions right now. I apologize to the students who have those questions.”
The Office of Student Life is now working to define exactly how the policy will apply to “organizations that are moving toward gender inclusion or need some guidance about how they move in that direction,” Khurana said.
The announcement of the sanctions has already prompted a number of social groups to go co-ed. The Spee Club permanently adopted gender neutral recruitment practices before the policy was announced. The Seneca, a formerly all-female club went co-ed in fall 2016. This fall, the traditionally female Sablière Society, Kappa Sigma, Alpha Epsilon Pi, and Kappa Kappa Gamma decided to admit all genders.
Some social groups have taken the opposite route, choosing to defy the College’s penalties. Harvard’s chapters of Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta announced in December they planned to continue with their standard female-only recruitment practices for members of the Class of 2021.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Law Review elected second-year Law student Michael Thomas the 132nd president of the journal last week.
Thomas, who was born in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y. and graduated from Princeton University in 2012 with a degree in sociology. Between studying at Princeton and at Harvard Law School, Thomas worked in the office of Counsel to the Mayor in New York City and served as a summer associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison last year.
Thomas succeeds ImeIme A. Umana, the publication’s first black woman president. In an email, Umana praised her successor and wrote she thinks the Law Review is in good hands under Thomas.
“The Law Review is lucky to have Michael at the helm. He is an incisive and thoughtful editor. More importantly, he is a compassionate peer,” she wrote.
Looking back on her time as president, Umana wrote that she is pleased with everything the Law Review accomplished in 2017.
“Thanks to our fantastic team of committed editors, the Law Review has had an exciting year. We welcomed the first-ever majority-female volume, selected our inaugural Public Interest Fellow, and launched a Blog, all in addition to publishing a wide range of premier legal scholarship,” she wrote.
Thomas did not respond to requests for comment by publication time.
Thomas is the second black president of the Law Review in two years. His election comes after the publication undertook a series of initiatives in recent years meant to diversify its ranks. The  journal, which expanded its affirmative action policy in 2013, elected the most diverse class of editors in its history in 2016 and its first majority female class last year.

The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study surpassed its $70 million capital campaign fundraising goal in May 2017, according to Director of External Relations Julia H. Cavanaugh.
The campaign garnered contributions from donors representing every Harvard school and every Harvard and Radcliffe class from 1933 to the present, Cavanaugh said. She said she attributes Radcliffe’s success in the campaign to Dean Lizabeth Cohen’s vision, the leadership of the campaign co-chairs Susan S. Wallach ’68 and Sidney R. Knafel ’52, and the efforts of alumni volunteers.
“We have received over 22,000 gifts from more than 6,800 donor households, including 1,300 first-time supporters of the Radcliffe Institute,” Cavanaugh said.
Wallach, apart from co-chairing the campaign, was also a major contributor, donating $10 million with her husband, Kenneth L. Wallach ’68.
“I know that a gift to Radcliffe is a gift to the scholars, artists, students, and public intellectuals who value the Institute as a unique space within Harvard—a school dedicated to creating and sharing transformative ideas across disciplines,” Wallach said in a statement.
Though Cavanaugh said Radcliffe’s capital campaign continues to experience success and plans to build on this momentum, she said the campaign has also had to overcome unique challenges.
“Unlike all other schools at Harvard, the Radcliffe Institute does not grant degrees to a graduating class annually, meaning our constituency does not grow organically,” Cavanaugh said. “To ensure the continued success of the Institute, we need to use the momentum of the Campaign to reach new audiences and engage old friends, many of whom may be unfamiliar with the work of today’s Radcliffe Institute.”
Cohen said she plans to use the funds raised to grow the Institute’s programs and launch new initiatives meant to strengthen the Institute and the University more broadly.
“We can help scholars tell a more inclusive history of women in America by acquiring new archival collections for the Schlesinger Library,” Cohen wrote in a statement. “We can help advance research across disciplines by funding more seminars and workshops led by Harvard faculty and Radcliffe fellows. And we can better share new ideas and research with a broad audience by expanding our public programming and improving our Institute facilities.”
Looking ahead, Cohen said she thinks that, regardless of this campaign’s success, the Institute still has unmet needs.
“There remain many opportunities for individuals, groups, or foundations to make gifts that will have a tremendous impact on the work of scholars, scientists, and artists in our fellowship program, on students and faculty at Harvard who benefit from our programs, and on the general public who flock to our lectures, conferences, and exhibitions,” Cohen said.
The capital campaign is officially set to conclude in June 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The number of Harvard students seeking to join sororities this semester dropped by roughly 60 percent from previous years—a decrease that came during the first-ever recruitment season in which some sorority hopefuls were subject to the College’s social group penalties.
The penalties—which took effect with the Class of 2021—bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding student group leadership positions, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships.
Breaking with at least five years of precedent, the Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council—the governing body for Harvard’s sororities—refused to publicly release the number of students who participated in recruitment this semester.
But, according to documents obtained by The Crimson, approximately 100 students registered to attend the first recruitment event. In order to be eligible to rush, students must attend the introductory event and must register in advance, per Council guidelines.
The number marks a significant drop from past years. In the 2017 recruitment season, 286 Harvard students expressed interest in female Greek life and, the year before, 280 students registered for sorority recruitment.
This fall also marked the first-ever recruitment season for the Fleur-de-Lis, formerly Harvard’s chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma and the first sorority on campus to go gender-neutral. The Fleur garnered interest from a total of 187 students and ultimately accepted 44 applicants, according to an emailed statement from Fleur President Tiana M. Menon ’19.
In an emailed statement, Cambridge-Area Panhellenic Council President Alexandra P. Murray ’19 wrote the group did not plan to release data about this year’s recruitment “out of respect to the process.”
Murray did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the decline in recruitment interest Sunday evening.
University President Drew G. Faust first introduced the sanctions in May 2016; and late last semester, the Harvard Corporation voted to officially confirm the policy. But it is not clear whether the penalties will immediately apply to Harvard’s all-female final clubs and sororities: Under a proposed “bridge program,” campus women’s groups could retain their “gender focus” for at least three years.
When the Fleur debuted its new gender-neutral membership policy in Jan. 2018, Menon wrote in a statement that the group plans to remain “female-focused.” The organization’s website asserts its mission is to create a safe and empowering space for “female-identifying individuals” at Harvard.
Menon did not directly answer a question asking whether the group accepted any men into its membership this semester.
“In keeping with our mission, we didn't solicit gender identities in our registration form so I don't have those numbers,” Menon wrote in an emailed statement.
Other campus sororities have opted for a strategy opposite to the Fleur’s, instead openly defying the College’s penalties. Harvard’s chapters of Alpha Phi, Delta Gamma, and Kappa Alpha Theta announced in December they planned to continue with their standard female-only recruitment practices for members of the Class of 2021 despite the social group policy.
Asked whether the policy was meant to reduce student interest in sororities during an interview last week, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana—who has largely become the face of the sanctions on the campus—did not directly answer.
“I think people understand that colleges and universities in the larger societies are in transitionary moments around this and those transitions can be sometimes challenging, as organizations adapt and evolve,” Khurana said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 5, 2018 at 10:11 p.m.
Four Philadelphia Eagles fans, roughly 10 New England Patriots fans, twice as many ambivalent onlookers, and one Minnesota Vikings fan sat in stunned silence as the final seconds of Super Bowl LII  ticked down in the Pforzheimer Junior Common Room Sunday night.
“Are you not aware you won the Super Bowl?” an onlooker asked after the clock had run out.
Seconds later, the four burst into screams and hugs in front of the television as the Eagles clinched the game 41-33.
Houses and clubs across the college hosted viewing parties for the Super Bowl, but not many were as rowdy as Pforzheimer's in the final seconds of the close game. Adams House projected the game in their dining hall, with deafening speakers drowning out the cheers of onlookers, while Quincy hosted a smaller watch party in their Junior Common Room.
A crowd of approximately 50 freshmen gathered to watch the game in the Queen’s Head Pub. A number of attendees, though, appeared to be more interested in the food than in the game, trickling out of the building early in the first half while clutching plates of chicken nuggets.
Many students and Harvard affiliates said that, while they are still fans of their hometown teams, they felt an affinity for the Patriots as Boston’s hometown team Sunday night.
Alysha L. Johnson ’14, a tutor in Quincy House, said she is a Detroit Lions fan at heart, but that  she was still rooting for the Patriots.
“I’ve been here since 2010, I was an undergrad here in 2010 so I’ve become adopted by them,” Johnson said of the Patriots during the game's first half. “I like the dynasty, we’re going to keep it going, Tom Brady is going to get his sixth ring.”
Other students took a different view. Some said they were supporting the Eagles not because they had affinity for team but because they could not bring themselves to support the Patriots.
Enrique Casas Jr. ’19—who emphasized he only really supports the Chicago Bears—said he was not cheering for the Patriots because he felt their fans were obnoxious.
“I’m actually a Chicago Bears fan,” Casas said. “It’s more so just being a fan of a team that sucks here at Harvard that made me by default an Eagles fan but I think, it’s really annoying just having to constantly hear about the five Super Bowl wins.”
The few true Eagles fans made up for their diminutive numbers with spirit. As the game clock approached 30 seconds in its final countdown, Eagles supporters began a roaring cheer of “I believe that we will win.”
Martha T. Gavula ’19, a loyal Eagles fan from Philadelphia, acknowledged her team’s fans have a reputation for being rowdy. But she defended her right to celebrate, especially after the Eagles lost their star quarterback and still made it to the Super Bowl.
“We’re just the underdogs of the underdogs,” Gavula said. “ I think you can call Philadelphia what you want, but this is our year, and I’m not gonna blame people for going crazy.”
The Eagles maintained a lead for most of the game, but when the Patriots pulled ahead at the beginning of the fourth quarter, many student viewers said they felt the tide was turning in the Patriots’ favor. The Eagles came back with a touchdown and fumble recovery to win the game, leaving undergraduates across campus stunned.
As the Junior Common Room emptied, an elated Eagles fan asked his phone, “Siri, who won the super bowl?”
A number of Patriots fans declined to comment after the game.
UPDATED: February 5, 2018
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Patriots pulled ahead at the end of the third quarter and that the Eagles came back to win the game with a touchdown and an interception. In fact, the Patriots pulled ahead at the beginning of the fourth quarter and the Eagles came back to win the game with a touchdown and a fumble recovery.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s basketball maintained its firm grip on first place in the Ivy League Saturday night, cruising to a 80-58 win over Cornell behind a double-double from freshman forward Jadyn Bush.
Saturday’s win was the sixth straight victory for the Crimson (13-6, 5-1 Ivy), and it improved the team’s record at Lavietes Pavilion to 10-0 for the season. Although Harvard never trailed the Big Red (5-14, 1-5) in Saturday’s contest, the win came at a cost for the team.
With just over six minutes remaining in the first half, sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm was whistled for a foul under Harvard’s basket. But the bigger concern was Boehm, who fell to the ground, grimacing in pain.
Boehm, one of the leading scorers and interior defenders for Harvard, left the floor under her own power, but would not return, watching the second half from the bench. In spite of Boehm’s absence, the Crimson continued to outplay Cornell on the court, leading comfortably throughout the half.
“I love how hard we played,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “We did a great job without Jeannie, and it allowed us time for the development of other players.”
Boehm was not the only casualty of Saturday evening’s matchup. There was more cause for concern, as junior guard Sydney Skinner hit the floor hard in the fourth quarter, diving to scoop up a loose ball. Skinner remained seated on the court for a few moments before heading to the locker room for further examination. The Plano, Texas, native, a crucial scoring presence off the bench, would not return to the game.
With the game seemingly in hand, and injuries mounting for Harvard, coach Delaney Smith emptied her bench. Mackenzie Barta, Matilda Salen, Maddie Stuhlreyer, all entered in the fourth quarter. All fourteen players on the roster saw action for the Crimson, with Delaney Smith looking to rest players before next weekend’s difficult road trip to Penn and Princeton.
Injuries aside, Saturday’s win was a comfortable one for Harvard, as the team led by double digits and by more than 20 points for much of the second half. Saturday also served as a career night for Bush.
Bush recorded her first career double-double, scoring a career high 12 points and chipping in with 11 rebounds.
“She’s incredibly athletic, and she’s got a tremendous work ethic,” Delaney-Smith said of Bush.  “Tonight, we needed her to step up big, and she did.”
Bush’s performance was crucial Saturday, with Boehm forced to the bench early with injury. The freshman from Federal Way, Wash., had to play extended minutes, and responded excellently, dominating the glass on both the offensive and defensive ends of the court.
Harvard garnered 13 rebounds in the first quarter alone, five of which were on the offensive end, leading to eight early second chance points. By the end of the game, the Crimson had a 46-23 advantage over the Big Red in rebounding, translating to a 31-8 mark in second chance points.
“Rebounding is something we’ve really made a focus this year,” Bush said. “This weekend we’ve finally shown the work we’ve been putting in this year.”
Bush would likely see more playing time if Boehm was forced to miss any games, and her performance was encouraging, as huge road matchups against the Tigers and Quakers loom large next weekend.
“We’re just going to keep on focusing on what we do well rather than adjust to what they do well,” Delaney-Smith said of the trip. “We know what we have to do against them.”
While the interior play was dominant, Harvard had also controlled much of the perimeter play as well. The hosts shot an impressive 53 percent from the field on Saturday, surpassing that with a 56 percent mark from beyond the arc.
“The big key in this game was playing together, playing as a team, and distributing the ball well,” Bush explained.
Sophomore Katie Benzan had yet another impressive performance against Cornell, leading all scorers with 20 points, and knocking down 5-7 three-pointers. The Wellesley Hills, Mass., native also chipped in with seven assists, one of which led to an exciting buzzer beater.
In the dying seconds of the first quarter, Benzan corralled a loose rebound, and tossed it up to Skinner, who dribbled the length of the court to lay the ball in just as the buzzer sounded, giving the Crimson a commanding 19-9 lead entering the second quarter.
The Big Red entered Saturday’s game on a skid, losing two straight and four of its past five games, all by double digits. Sophomore guard Samantha Widmann, the team’s leading scorer, was contained for most of the game, as the stifling Harvard defense held her to 16 points on just 7-20 shooting.
The Crimson will have to remain solid on defense as the team hits the road for its first Ancient Eight road weekend. Penn and Princeton, which are tied for second in the league, will be a huge challenge for a Harvard team that is 10-0 at Lavietes, but 1-5 in true road games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After four consecutive 9-0 victories, No. 3 Harvard men’s squash took on No. 6 Penn at the Murr Center on Sunday. But the Quakers would not fold as easily as the Crimson’s recent opponents had all done.
After most of the individual matches had wrapped up, it was deadlocked at 4-4 with just the bout between number eight Bradley Smith and Penn’s James B. Watson remaining. Like the overall match, Smith and Watson’s clash was a back-and-forth affair. Eventually, Smith took a 10-4 lead in the final game. Watson scraped and clawed for five straight points to nearly knot the game at 10, but the Quakers' comeback was not to be. Smith put away Watson for an 11-9 decision, and Harvard (9-1, 4-1 Ivy) breathed a collective sigh of relief as it collected its fifth consecutive victory.
This weekend’s matches, against Ivy League foes Penn (9-4, 3-2) and No. 7 Princeton (8-3, 3-2), were slightly closer than previous matchups against non-conference opponents Western Ontario, Rochester, and Drexel.
“I think as a unit we definitely were not as strong today as we have been,” co-captain Madhav Dhingra said. “You’ve got to give [Penn] credit. They came out fighting really hard from point one in each of their matches.”
One factor working against the Crimson’s favor over the weekend was the absence of typical number five player Samuel Scherl. The freshman suffered an ankle injury on Friday, and so several Harvard players were forced to shift up to play in higher slots than they were accustomed to.
“I think we came out really strong yesterday,” Dhingra said. “We had a little hiccup with our No. 5 Sam Scherl. It was a good test for the team going in on the weekend without him just to see how everyone else would kind of step up.”
HARVARD 5, PENN 4
Aside from Smith’s battle, the Crimson and the Quakers were decidedly evenly matched throughout Sunday’s contest.
Dhingra dropped his first decision of the season, and Harvard also suffered defeats in spots one, seven, and nine. However, it was the trio of sophomores Timothy Brownell and Sean Hughes and co-captain David Ryan which saved the day for Harvard.
Brownell, Hughes, and Ryan all went undefeated on the weekend. Facing off against the Quakers, Brownell and Ryan each gathered 3-0 sweeps, and Hughes’ win continued his undefeated mark in his collegiate career.
“Each match is important, whether that’s 5-4 or 9-0,” Dhingra said. “Win or lose we’re just looking for people to really push themselves and improve from where they were a day ago or a week ago or a month ago. So each match is important, but that being said our two, three, and four have been rock solid.”
HARVARD 9, PRINCETON 0
Several Crimson submitted strong performances against the visiting Tigers, and several others fended off their challengers to secure Harvard’s first victory of the weekend.
In spots two through five, seven, and nine, Harvard swept Princeton. In an especially dominant showing, Ryan defeated the Tigers’ Clark Doyle in a trio of 11-2 games.
Sophomore Saadeldin Abouaish played in Saturday's most hotly-contested match. Princeton’s Youssef Ibrahim rallied after losing the first game to capture the second, 12-10. In what would become a back-and-forth battle, Abouaish reclaimed the lead in the third contest, winning 11-6. However, Ibrahim evaded elimination with an 11-6 victory of his own. It would come down to the fifth and deciding game to choose a winner at the No. 1 spot.
In that final game, Abouaish came out on top in an 11-8 decision.
As the regular season winds down—with only three matches remaining—the team looks to both continue its winning momentum and tune up for Nationals in late February.
“Trinity’s one of our biggest rivals, and Yale has been performing well too, so two solid tests before the Nationals,” Dhingra said. “People have improved significantly from where they were a month or two months ago, and everyone has bought in. I’m pretty excited for Nationals, and I think we’ve got a good shot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team entered this weekend riding the momentum of a 5-game win streak. The squad took on South Florida at the Murr Center on Sunday in what turned out to be a highly competitive matchup. After the Crimson went down early, losing the doubles point for the first time this season, it all came down to a three-set match between co-captain Kenny Tao and South Florida junior Grayson Goldin.
After Goldin came back in the second set to even the playing field, Tao managed to edge his opponent out and claim the third set for a final score of 705, 6-7 (7), 6-2. Tao’s win secured the Crimson’s 4-3 victory and moves Harvard to a 6-0 record, its best start to a season since 2005.
The Crimson suffered an early doubles setback, an unusual occurrence for the team. USF defeated Harvard co-captain Jean Thirouin and junior Andy Zhou at third doubles, before Tao and sophomore Logan Weber dropped their match 3-6 at first doubles. Junior Christopher Morrow and senior Grant Solomon’s win at second doubles was not enough to give the Crimson the advantage.
Solomon remains undefeated in doubles this season, moving to 3-0.
Harvard came back on the singles side with an early win from rookie Constantin Zoske, defeating his Bulls’ opponent in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1. Zhou then gave the Crimson the lead with a victory over USF senior Peter Bertran, 6-3, 7-5.
Rookie Robert Wrzesinski also earned a crucial victory for Harvard at fourth singles. The Vilnius, Lithuania native fell 4-6 in the first set, but came back to take the next two sets 6-3,6- 0. With losses from Thirouin and Solomon at second and fifth singles, respectively, the Crimson was tied 3-3 with the Bulls, and it came down to the faceoff between Tao and Goldin.
The Crimson’s win ties the all-time series with USF 2-2. The team will hit the road next week to take on Michigan and Michigan State.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a weekend that pitted the Crimson against two of the nation’s fiercest opponents, the Harvard women’s hockey team garnered mixed results, coming from behind to tie No. 5 Cornell, 2-2, on Friday, before falling to No. 4 Colgate, 4-0, on Saturday.
COLGATE 4, HARVARD 0
Despite staying within touching distance for the majority of the game, the Crimson (9-12-2, 7-9-2 ECAC) were ultimately shut out by the Raiders (25-4-1, 15-3-0), 4-0, on Saturday afternoon.
It took 10 shots on goal for Colgate to break the scoreless tie, as the Raiders finally struck around 12 minutes into the first period. Junior forward Jessie Eldridge broke away near the halfway line and finished past Harvard sophomore keeper Beth Larcom, who had bailed out her teams several times up until that point.
After the opening goal, the Crimson settled down, coming into its own and finding its rhythm against its opponents from upstate New York. Harvard looked menacing at times despite having fewer shots on goal in the game. Freshman forward Becca Gilmore looked especially dangerous on the breakaway.
The Crimson held the Raiders in check for almost 40 minutes before the floodgates opened, as the visitors conceded twice in a span of 30 seconds in the third period. With seven minutes remaining in the game, junior defender Olivia Zafuto put the first away from point blank following a save from Larcom. Just after the ensuing faceoff, Colgate instantly made its way down the ice once again, with senior forward Shelby Perry finishing off Eldridge’s assist to put the game out of reach for Harvard.
“I think we played with a lot of speed and we created a lot of chances,” Gilmore said. “We have to keep working on finishing and capitalizing on the opponent’s mistakes to win those games, especially against really talented teams.”
Larcom finished the contest with 44 saves, setting a new career high and eclipsing the 41 saves made by her freshman counterpart Becky Dutton on the previous night.
With three minutes remaining, Colgate added a fourth goal from Eldridge, her second of the night. This capped off a strong performance for the Raiders, who sit second in the ECAC standings. The Crimson is currently tied for seventh place in the ECAC with Yale, with just two points separating it from ninth-place Rensselaer and the non-playoff spots.
HARVARD 2, CORNELL 2
Harvard (9-11-2, 7-8-2) pulled out a huge 2-2 tie in the first of its two home games of the weekend vs No. 5 Cornell (13-7-3, 10-5-2), in a game with big playoff implications between Ivy League rivals.
The Crimson found itself 2-0 down in the first period against one of the top programs in the nation after the Big Red lit the lamp twice early with goals from freshman defender Kendra Nealy and senior forward Brianna Veerman. Getting anything out of the game looked nearly impossible for Harvard heading into the second period.
The Crimson was not deterred though, and in the later stages of the game proved that it was able to keep up with some of the best. Midway through the second period, Harvard found itself in a three-versus-one, with freshman forward Brooke Jovanovich passing off to fellow freshman forward Keely Moy, who finished coolly to give the Crimson hope heading into the final frame. This was Moy’s third goal in her last two games, an impressive tally for the San Diego native.
With just under a minute remaining against the defending ECAC-runners up, and its net sitting empty, Harvard was pushing hard for the equalizer when the breakthrough finally came.
Gilmore picked up the puck on the left side before finding sophomore Kat Hughes in the right circle, who sent a sizzling shot past junior keeper Marlene Boissonnault to tie the Ancient Eight affair.
Neither team was able to break the other down in overtime and thus both teams had to settle for a 2-2 finish. Although the Big Red outshot Harvard 43-25 overall and performed better on faceoffs, winning 32 to the Crimson’s 21, both teams left the ice knowing that the game could’ve went either way. Harvard came up empty on four power plays, while Cornell was not able to convert any of its three power plays on the night.
Coach Stone’s trust in her younger players paid off in a big way for the Crimson on Friday. One of the goals, and both of the assists came from freshmen, and it was not just on offense that the first years were putting in a shift. In just her third career start, Dutton racked up 41 saves—just one shy of doubling her career high of 21, which came the last time Harvard matched up against the Big Red, a 4-3 loss in January.
“The team really stepped up to claw back and tie that game,” Dutton said. “It was a huge point as we’re trying to make playoffs right now. I can’t be proud enough of the team really. We knew that we could do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Out of all the games on the schedule this season for Harvard women’s squash, this weekend’s slate seemed to be the most compelling. On Saturday, the No. 2 Crimson faced No. 1 Princeton in a grudge match of the unbeatens. Just a day later, the team was set for a rematch of last year’s national championship against No. 7 Penn—led by undefeated star junior Reeham Salah.
But that’s the magic of the team—they make compelling matches on paper seem predetermined. For the third and fourth times, Harvard (10-0, 5-0 Ivy) bended as far as it has all season. The Crimson dropped just one match each day.
For all of the anticlimax, there was supposed to be a matching amount of excitement. The Quakers were supposed to exact revenge on the Cambridge, Mass., squad that had denied the program its second national championship last year. But its top-heavy squad including two-time individual national finalist Salah and seniors Melissa Alves and Marie Stephan had buckled under pressure this season and lost all four of its matchups against top-flight teams.
The real excitement came with the Saturday Ivy League draw: Princeton versus Harvard, led by two of the nation’s best collegiate players and Tournament of Championship participants in Crimson junior Sabrina Sobhy and Tigers senior Olivia Fiechter. The air of suspense quickly evaporated, though, as the star power was rendered null by the depth of Harvard.
HARVARD 8, PENN 1
The danger in this matchup was not that the Crimson couldn’t win the match, but rather that underdog Penn would squirrel a way to victory. The Quakers would have to hang onto dear life and hope that that the top end of its lineup could grind out some wins. It was not without premise. In last year’s national championship, Salah and Alves defeated Sobhy and reigning individual champion Gina Kennedy in the top two slots.
But any intrigue quickly dissipated as Harvard’s first wave swept in straight games, and Kennedy exacted revenge against Alves. Four other games would go the minimum in Harvard’s favor.
Instead the attention was pulled to center court where Sobhy faced off against “The Hammer.” The game followed course with the weekend. Salah won in three games, grounding any hype, which had already fell once it was learned that no rematch of the individual national championship between Salah and the sophomore Kennedy was to take place this weekend.
The courts had already quieted when the tensest matchup of the day occurred between Stephan and Crimson junior Kayley Leonard heated up. Already loaded with history from last year’s national finals when Leonard staved off five straight match points to win in five games, the two tangled—many times literally—in an emotional rematch. The pivotal third game, which eventually put Leonard up 2-1, saw nearly every point dotted with interference claims. Leonard wiggled through to win in four games.
HARVARD 8, PRINCETON 1
Harvard wins by putting the game out of contention early and often. This also means that the strained moments of match day come right as the first serve goes up.
In the first game, Kennedy fell in the first game to freshman Raneem El Torky and things seemed unusually uncertain.
“I was on the first shift and I lost the first game,” Kennedy said. “I knew it was going to be a tough match…The courts are really hot so it’s all about finding your length. The mental work that we’ve been doing has really been helpful to stay calm and in the game.”
This continued into the second game, as Kennedy went down 5-2. But she responded with seven straight points and even up the match. She then won the third by rattling off six straight winners, en route to a four-game victory.
This was as close as top-ranked Princeton got. Harvard kept the Tigers off balance and uncomfortable, no more than Leonard who bageled freshman Grace Doyle in the first game as part of one of five Harvard three-game sweeps.
With victory already established despite still playing the second wave, Sobhy battled Fiechter to five games in an exceptional display of All-American squash, full of long rallies and lead changes.
“I’ve played her probably like 50 times since we were 12 years old and she’s a good friend of mine,” Sobhy said. “So, we’ve been playing together ever since. This was actually the first time she beat me, and she played so well.”
There are two more weeks of team squash, two more weeks to change the status quo, and a Howe Cup at stake. But for now, Harvard, bolstered by depth and top talent alike, has reestablished its number one ranking—if that was ever in doubt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a rainy Sunday, No. 5 Harvard men’s and No. 6 women’s fencing returned to Cambridge, Mass. to host its only home matches of their 2017-18 seasons. Visiting the Crimson was New York University, facing Harvard for the second time this season. Last December, in the last meeting between the two teams, Harvard left with a win for the women’s and a loss for the men’s.
In the Malkin Athletic Center on Sunday, all that could be heard was the roar of the athletes cheering on their teammates, palpable energy that translated into wins for both the women’s and men’s teams.
MEN’S FENCING
Coming off of a strong sweep at St. John’s Invitational on Jan. 20, the team was in high spirits after five wins against Notre Dame, Columbia, Ohio State, St. John’s, and Penn State. There was one notable absence from the men’s roster this match—Olympian Eli Dershwitz. The junior co-captain who led the Harvard record in sabre was busy winning his second international gold medal this year in the sabre category at the Senior World Cup Italy after defeating the top three sabre fencers in the world.
As the first bouts began, the Crimson looked to draw first blood with aggressive attacks within the first seconds of each bout. The men’s foil squad had the smoother afternoon or the three categories, finishing with a 6-3 record to help guide the full team to a tight victory. The sabre squad also pushed hard for a Harvard win with senior Erwin Cai’s 2-1 record, senior co-captain Eric Zhao’s 2-1 record, as well as sophomore Phillipe Guy securing a 5-4 win in this bout on top of a 5-4 win in sabre against the Bobcats. NYU, however, came out on top in the epee category, with a 6-3 win over Harvard, despite freshman Charles Horowitz scoring a 2-1 record and a plus-two touch differential.
“The biggest takeaway is that supporting your team is equal to working your hardest,” Cai said.
With only two bouts remaining in the match, tensions were high for both teams. The final epee bout and sabre bout occurred simultaneously in the gym with both mats surrounded by players shouting encouragement for their teammates.
Finally, Horowitz landed the winning hit, ending the bout with a 5-3 score and giving Harvard the overall win. The final scoreline was a 14-13 win for the Crimson after Cai was unable to come back to win his final bout in the sabre category. The win adds to Harvard’s strong 10-1 season.
“The single most important thing in these types of matches is that difference in skill accounts only for so much,” junior Milo Davidson said. “It’s really about who has more energy and who truly wants it more. The cheering from the team helps that.”
WOMEN’S FENCING
At the St. John’s Invitational on January 20th, the Crimson fought for a 2-3 tournament record. The team earned wins against Ohio State and St. John’s, but was unable to overpower the top three teams in the country, Notre Dame, Columbia, and Penn State.
Harvard came into Sunday’s event 8-4 overall, ranked sixth in the nation and looking to have a confident win at home. The first sabre bout opened with sophomore Marta Lasota. The Silver Spring, Md., native quickly jumped out to a 3-0 lead against junior Jacqueline Tubbs before losing the fast-paced bout 5-3.
The Crimson moved to a 9-4 record for the season led by freshman Saanchi Kukadia, junior Sharon Ra, and junior Shawn Wallace who each tallied a 3-0 record in the epee category to record a 9-0 steamroll over the Bobcats.
However, the women’s sabre squad had a much tougher battle, fighting through to win 5-4 against NYU with junior Gabrielle Tartakovsky winning all three of her bouts along with Lasota completing a 2-1 record. In the foil category, the team had a shakier start, but quickly gained steam to dominate the Bobcats 7-2 with senior co-captain MacKenzie Lawrence and junior Liana Henderson-Semel both shutting out NYU with a 3-0 record each.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard ski team competed this weekend at the University of Vermont Carnival. The Alpine team traveled to Stowe, Vermont while the Cross Country races were held in Craftsbury, Vermont. Improving their point total from last year at the same carnival, the Crimson ski team scored 293 points and finished in 11th place out of the 16 EISA teams.
Skiing in sub-ten degree weather on both days, juniors Nina Armstrong and Hannah Hardenbergh led the Harvard nordic team at the Craftsbury Outdoor Center. In Friday’s women’s 15K, Armstrong placed 16th with a time of 48:34.0, scoring her best career finish in that event. Hardenbergh crossed the finish line of the 15K at 50:12.0, taking home 23rd. In addition, she came in 20th in Saturday’s five-kilometer race.
On the men’s side, senior Connor Green, sophomore William Rhatigan and junior Jacob Meyerson were a dominant trio for the Crimson. In the men’s 20K, Green finished in 40th, Rhatigan placed 51st and Meyerson took 69th. In the 10K,  Rhatigan led his squad in 27th place, Green was 44th and Meyerson finished in 47th.
“Crazy insane weather pattern here that normally would cancel an event for a day or two,“ said Alpine head coach Scott MacPherson. “But Stowe is an unbelievable mountain and they got the cats out first thing to blade all the snow off the hill.”
Battling the frigid temperatures and challenging snow conditions, the Alpine team left with multiple career-best finishes. In the Giant Slalom, sophomore Carter Kendig led in 33rd place. Fellow sophomores Dillon Smith and Robert Dorfman started with bib’s seeded to finish in the high 80’s, however, both had career best finishes and ended up placing 35th and 36th respectively. In the Slalom race, senior Pieter Weemaes was the lone Crimson men's scorer, finishing with a combined time of 2:24.64 to take home 52nd place.
For the women, Freshman Nellie Ide led the way in both the GS and SL races. In the GS, Ide’s top-15 second run helped her finish in 22nd place overall. In the SL race, Ide led the Crimson in 29th place and senior Kelly Steeves came in 40th.
“UVM was classic Stowe—a lot of highs and a lot of lows. We had three guys place in the top 40 in the GS. It was the best guys’ score in recent memory. Nellie got 23rd which was awesome and all three girls who raced the slalom qualified for second runs,” freshman Allegra Colman said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the No. 21 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team faced Princeton and Yale, the Crimson fell to the Tigers by nearly 100 points, snapping Harvard’s 21-meet undefeated streak. The results couldn’t have been more different this time around.
The Crimson entered Saturday’s HYP meet with a similar run of victories, boasting 17 consecutive wins in dual competition. The stakes were the same: beat Princeton and walk away with the Ivy League dual championship, lose to the Tigers or the Bulldogs and give up an undefeated season.
In the end, though, Harvard (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) beat both Ancient Eight rivals with ease, eclipsing Yale (7-2, 5-2) and Princeton (7-4, 5-2), 242-111 and 250-103, respectively at Blodgett Pool. With the win, the Crimson closes out a second undefeated regular season in as many years and repeats as Ivy League Dual Meet champions.
“Although we don't stress too much about our dual meet record, it was pretty exhilarating to win the meet by such a huge margin,” sophomore Raphael Marcoux said.
Harvard took top honors in 14 of 19 events en route to the victory, sweeping the first three spots in four events, and placing at least one athlete on the podium in every contest.
Although the win came from a team-wide effort, the Crimson was led by a handful of standout performances.
Senior Koya Osada delivered one such performance, finishing on the podium in every race he contested and collecting a pair of first-place results. The Chapel Hill, N.C. native won the 200-yard backstroke, leading a pack of Harvard swimmers to the wall. Junior Daniel Tran took second place in the event, with the first-year duo of Eric Whisenant and Miles McAllister in third and fourth, respectively.
Osada also contributed to the Crimson’s winning effort in the 200-yard medley relay. The senior was joined by junior Sebastian Lutz and fellow seniors Steven Tan and Paul O’Hara. Lutz and Osada would team up again in the 400-yard medley relay, taking third place along with senior Ed Kim and freshman Mahlon Reihman. The race was won by the Harvard A lineup of Tan, Marcoux, and sophomores Dean Farris and Daniel Chang.
To add to an already impressive collection of results, Osada also finished third in the 200-yard IM and second in the 100 backstroke, seven-tenths of a second ahead of Tran and nearly a full second behind Farris.
Farris’ victory in the 100 back was just one in a string of commanding performances throughout the meet. The standout sophomore won every event he competed in, racking up three solo wins and a pair of relay victories. Farris’ first gold-medal finish came in the 200-yard freestyle, with junior Brennan Novak taking second and freshman Corban Rawls close behind in third. Immediately after winning the 200 free, Farris returned to the pool to take top marks in the 100 back.
The Atlanta, Ga., native would also touch the wall first in the 100-yard freestyle, obliterating his previous-best time in the event this season by nearly a second and finishing with the second-fastest mark in program history, second only to his own record in the event. Farris’ final win came in the last event of the weekend, as he joined up with Marcoux, Reihman, and Kim to capture first place in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
The Crimson’s dominant relay squad also opened the meet with a win, as Marcoux, Kim, O’Hara, and Tan beat Princeton’s second-place lineup to the wall by more than a second in the 200 freestyle relay.
“It was cool to see the win in the very first relay and to start off so strong,” co-captain Luke Morgan-Scott said. “Steven Tan’s performance in the 200 free relay was an incredible way to start off the meet. It was awesome to watch.”
Tan’s contribution to the 200 free relay was merely the first in a series of impressive swims by the senior. In an effort to rival Farris’, Tan won every event that he contested. The Aurora, Ill., native followed up the opening relay win by touching the wall first in the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 19.85. Kim collected a third-place result in the event with a mark of 20.01.
Tan also swam in the winning 200 and 400-yard medley relay lineups and picked up a second solo victory in the 100-yard butterfly. Marcoux finished one tenth of a second behind in the silver-medal position.
Marcoux also faced an unusual opponent, as his younger brother, Philippe, swims for Yale. The brothers faced off in four events, with Raphael coming away with the win in each of them.
“We've been swimming together for about ten years now, so it felt really strange competing against him on another team,” Marcoux said.
Though a fraternal connection was lacking, Harvard also dominated in the distance events. In the 1650-yard freestyle, junior Logan Houck came tantalizingly close to breaking the Blodgett record of 14:47.1, touching the wall in 14:47.39. The mark was still easily good for the win, and the junior outpaced teammate Brennan Novak in second by nearly 30 seconds. Senior Kent Haeffner and sophomore Zach Snyder ended up in third and fourth, respectively, to seal the sweep.
Novak would have a record-setting swim of his own in the second day of the meet, as he toppled the previous-best mark for the pool in the 500 freestyle. The junior’s time of 4:16.56 was more than a tenth of second faster than the existing record, set by Yale senior Kei Hyogo. Hyogo finished in third on the day, a second behind Houck and four seconds back from Novak.
Hyogo was also bested by a Crimson swimmer in the 400-yard IM, as freshman Michael Zarian took the top spot. The rookie also ended up second in the 200-yard butterfly, with fellow first-year Eric Whisenant in third.
“The freshmen did incredibly this weekend,” Chang said. “They really contributed to the excitement and momentum we held throughout the entire meet.”
The rookies’ podium results in the 200-yard fly highlighted Harvard’s success even in the events it didn’t win. Chang took third in the 100-yard breaststroke, one such event, and finished second in the 200-yard iteration.
Co-captain Bobby Ross also secured a top-three result in the one-meter dive, scoring 306.90 points to end up in second. The Crimson had more success in the three-meter event, with senior David Pfeifer taking top marks and sophomore Austin Fields finishing in third.
With a second consecutive dual meet championship wrapped up, Harvard will turn its attention to attaining outright Ivy League supremacy at the Ancient Eight Championship Meet in March.
“We’re feeling good for Ivies, but it’s a whole different event.” Morgan-Scott said. “We’re definitely excited and definitely more confident than we were, but it’s important not to be complacent, and we still have work to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There ain’t no rest for the weary. That isn’t a problem for the track and field team, however, which if anything is gaining steam as the season progresses.
Less than a month from the Ivy Indoor Heptagonal Championships, the group has bolstered it’s schedule. Competing in two meets this over the weekend break—prior to next week’s four meets—individual performances and rookies shined for the squad.
SCARLET AND WHITE
Remaining within city limits, the group of student-athletes traveled across Beantown to the 2018 Bruce Lehane Scarlet and White Meet held Saturday at the Boston University Track and Tennis Center. Led by junior co-captain Myles Marshall, the men’s team excelled in the mid-distance races. In the women’s division, it was the sprinters that ruled the day.
Marshall got things rolling with a record breaking two-lap sprint. Finishing the 800-meter run in 1:47.74, the co-captain emerged from the event with a silver medal around his neck, a new personal best, and a new collegiate record. The program’s fastest time in the event, the one the co-captain broke, had been previously held by none other than Marshall himself.
Then came the freshman. In the 500-meter, first-year Ryan Thrush claimed the bronze medal in his best time of the year in the event, 1:03.93.
Even when the Patriots didn’t this weekend, junior co-captain Gabby Thomas did her job in one of her staple races, the 200-meter dash. The standout junior claimed gold in 23.26 seconds. However, rookie Olivia Okoli followed close behind. The freshman, in her first collegiate attempt at the event, crossed the finish line in 24.26 seconds—enough for sixth place and to clock the fourth fastest time in Harvard history.
“I was really nervous about the race beforehand, as I’d only run one indoor 200 before, and that was with no prior experience on an indoor track, so I was slightly apprehensive as to how I’d do,” Okoli said. “But it was definitely exciting to run, and I was happy with it afterwards.  It also highlighted definite areas for improvement, which just motivates me to train harder and get better over the distance.”
Sophomore Maya Miklos continued to improve on her already excellent 500-meter time. The mid-distance mogul paced the group, clocking a 1:13.26 finish and breaking her personal record in the event. Additionally, the time is the third fastest in the history of the program.
In her first ever attempt at running the 800-meter for the Crimson, junior Kathryn Gillespie ran the eighth-fastest time in program history. The 2:08.82 finish merited Gillespie a fifth place spot.
In the 4x400-meter relay, the team set another record, as has become the status quo for the group. Represented by sophomores Zoe Hughes, Karina Joiner, Miklos, as well as junior Thomas, the quartet grabbed another gold medal. In addition, the group set the second fastest indoor time in program history and punched their names in the record books with the fourth fastest time in Ancient Eight history.
CRIMSON ELITE
On Friday afternoon, Harvard hosted the Crimson Elite meet. The men’s side of the team claimed a meet victory in lieu of a 66-point performance.
Co-captain Jay Hebert rattled things off in the 60-meter hurdles. Sprinting to a quick 7.96 finish, the senior clocked the Crimson’s second fastest time in the event ever, as well as his own personal best.
The 400-meter dash showcased some of the squad’s freshmen talent. In his collegiate debut in the race, first-year Thrush captured the gold in a 49.32 lap. In the effort, Thrush edged out his classmate, Rodney Agyare-May—who placed second—by just .02 seconds. Another fresh face, rookie John Fish, grabbed a gold of his own on the afternoon in a 4:22.78 mile.
The field was ruled by sophomores. In weight throw, Gunnar Allison reached 15.53 meters, earning a bronze necklace. Classmate, sophomore Ian West cleared 4.80 meters in pole vault to grab a gold.
“Overall, it was a productive weekend,” Allison said. “The weight throw is relatively new for me so I’m working on getting more comfortable and pushing the mark as we head towards championship season. This weekend produced a lot of things for us to learn from and I’m proud of how hard the Harvard throws crew has been working.”
In pole vault, the women’s side nearly swept, claiming both second and third. Co-captain Marlena Sabatino earned the silver in a 3.80-meter jump while junior Nicole Trenchard was one step behind after the 3.70-meter finish.
Freshman Emily Johns rounded out the field performance for the women’s squad with a second place finish in her flight, the result of 12.59-meter throw in shot put.
“As a freshman, I am happy with what I have done so far and am hoping to better myself and contribute to the team even more as the season progresses,” Johns said. “The team is really strong and coming into form as we're nearing the end of the indoor season.”
Thomas earned her first of three golds on the weekend under the roof of this Crimson arena. The junior finished the 60-meter dash in 7.32 seconds, her second fastest time of the season.
“It was a tremendous honor to be given the opportunity to represent Harvard in the mile on our home track,” Fish said. “I was excited to come home with the win, but I’m already shifting my focus to a race only a few weeks away: Indoor Heps. The team has been working incredibly hard, and I’m incredibly excited to see that pay off.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team (10-8-4, 9-5-3 ECAC) squares off against Boston University (14-11-2, 10-7-2 Hockey East) in a rematch of last year's tournament finale.
In 2017, the Crimson captured its first Beanpot title since 1993 and its 11th in program history. On the other side of the ice, the Terriers have a history of dominating the tournament and are in search of their 31st Beanpot crown after failing to secure it the past two seasons.

Sometimes, collard greens and a turkey sandwich that for some reason has peaches on it just don’t cut it for lunch. So, you pull out your Mange app and debate over getting an omelette or a burger. You order the burger, add cheese, and wait a dreaded seventeen minutes because no one in Lev wanted to eat the turkey sandwich either.
At this point, your burger embarks on one of three journeys:
It’s Black
It’s more likely than not you’ll be presented with a coal-like puck of meat thinly veiled with a slice of cheese—arranged almost as if to conceal the shame of the charred burger you have been presented with. Some people are not as fortunate, or mentally prepared, to look at their burger. They unknowingly bite into the edible chimney, then put it down. Tears leak from their eyes. Are these patties cooked on the sun and shipped back to Earth? Perhaps that would explain the seventeen minute wait. These are by far the saddest of dhall burgers to encounter. Pray that you do not receive one.
It’s Still Breathing
Conversely, your burger may have been cooked with a flashlight, and is still alive. These borderline raw concoctions are so undercooked that the warmth of the patty does not even start to melt the cheese, which makes for a textural nightmare. If the bun is stale, just rent a Zipcar and drive into the ocean. This is the lowest point of your life. I do not know what “umami” means, but it is not this.
It’s PERFECT
Sometimes, the person manning the grill is on their A-game. Few dining halls have that one chef that always nails their grill orders. For example, Mather House’s Lynette should be on Chopped. Few people have enhanced my Harvard experience more than Lynette. Lynette is the best. Shoutout to Lynette. I love you. These chefs grill the bun while the patty cooks, throw the cheese on the patty while it reaches that perfect medium rare/medium range, and say a prayer that it may nourish your body before putting it out on the countertop. The cross section which brands these beautiful creations will change your life. It’s a beautiful sight. It’s a beautiful burger. It’s perfect.
In sum, approach the HUDS Grill burger with caution. It could make or break your day. Better yet, just order an omelette.
