After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boiling Crab, a seafood chain originally from Garden Grove, Calif., plans on debuting its first Massachusetts location in Harvard Square early next year.
The restaurant will be located at 96 Winthrop St., which previously housed the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 – an umbrella organization that comprises the Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals, and the Harvard Krokodiloes – from 2014 to 2018. The space at 96 Winthrop St. also housed the Irish pub Tommy Doyle’s from 2005 to 2013.
The Boiling Crab – founded by Dada Ngo and Sinh Nguyen in 2004 – specializes in Louisiana-style Cajun seafood. After the launch of its first restaurant in Garden Grove, it has since expanded across the nation to Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Texas, and Washington D.C., and internationally to China and Australia.
Customers can expect to order blue crab, lobster, shrimp, crawfish, mussels, or oysters at The Boiling Crab. Diners may also customize their meal by selecting from a variety of sauces – including the seafood chain’s famous The Whole Sha-Bang! sauce – and spice levels ranging from “non-spicy” to “XXX.”
The Cambridge License Commission unanimously approved The Boiling Crab’s request for a liquor license in late July.
Andrew Upton, an attorney representing The Boiling Crab in front of the License Commission, described the restaurant as a “communal dining experience.”
“It’s boiled shellfish with various sauces and other kinds of seafood. [It] pairs well with beer, wine, and cocktails,” he said during the meeting.
David Nguyen – the manager of the proposed location and vice president of operations at The Boiling Crab – told the commission that the restaurant will offer an “eat with your hands” type of food.
“Outside of the Texas-Louisiana area, most people have never really experienced a real crab boil,” he said. “Once people got a chance to taste and experience our authentic boil, it started getting very popular and gave us a chance to expand all over California.”
The restaurant’s proposed hours are from 3 p.m to 10 p.m. on weekdays and noon to 10 p.m. on weekends, and it plans to seat up to 218 customers.
The state Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission must confirm the license the Cambridge commission awarded to The Boiling Crab before the store can open.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will not accept federal aid from the American Rescue Plan Act, the federal stimulus package passed in March — the third time the University has refused rescue funds since the start of the pandemic.
“Harvard is not accepting the federal funds,” University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement Thursday. Bloomberg News was the first to report the move on Wednesday.
The stimulus package allocated around $40 billion in relief to thousands of colleges and universities across the country to cover pandemic-related expenses. Harvard was eligible to receive an estimated $25.5 million, according to an analysis by the American Council on Education in March.
The bill — signed into law by President Joe Biden on March 11 — prioritized distributing aid to institutions with endowments of less than $1 million. Even though the University’s endowment is valued at $41.9 billion, Harvard was still eligible to receive funds.
The move to reject the aid is consistent with the University’s choices to reject two other rounds of federal funds last year.
In April 2020, Harvard was set to receive nearly $9 million from the first aid package, but moved not to accept the funds after Republican lawmakers and then-President Donald Trump criticized the University for taking aid while boasting a multi-billion dollar endowment.
In December 2020, Harvard declined a second round of federal pandemic aid, citing concerns that it would have to follow strict guidance prohibiting colleges and universities from distributing the funds to undocumented students.
Newton declined to elaborate Thursday on the University’s decision to reject the third round of aid.
According to the Department of Education’s website, relief funds voluntarily declined by schools will be “redistributed to institutions with greater needs.” Schools had until Wednesday to decide whether to accept the funding.
