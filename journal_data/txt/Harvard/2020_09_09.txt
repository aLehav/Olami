After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was never going to live up to the animated version.
How could it? Disney’s original 1998 film grossed over $300 million at the box office, earned countless accolades, and became a cultural staple for an entire generation. Sequels and adaptations are seldom as good as their originals, and “Mulan” is no exception. It joins the ranks of “Aladdin," “The Lion King," and “Dumbo” (Remember “Dumbo”? Because I don’t.) as yet another Disney adaptation that trades the charm of its animated predecessor for, well, nothing.
China’s under attack. The emperor (Jet Li) orders one man from every family to fight, and Hua Mulan (Liu Yifei) enlists as a man so her disabled veteran father (Tzi Ma) doesn’t have to. There’s a bunch of punching and kicking, some buckets of water make it up a hill, an imaginary phoenix shows up, and — poof! Mulan has saved the Imperial Army, the Emperor, and all of China, thus restoring honor to her father, her family, and, presumably, her cow.
It’s not a frame by frame adaptation of the animated film, by any means. Gone are Mushu, Li Shang, and the Huns. Instead, Mulan faces off against the Rouran invaders, who are led by Böri Khan (Jason Scott Lee) and aided by a spiteful witch named Xianniang (Gong Li). And there are no more musical numbers either; the only remnants of classics like “Reflection” and “A Girl Worth Fighting For” are the subtle cues in the score and occasional snippets of lyrics-turned-dialogue.
That being said, there are still plenty of callbacks: the matchmaker fiasco, the training camp montage, and even the part where Mulan gets unwelcome visitors during a midnight lake bath. But as much as I love seeing Liu Yifei royally bungle a tea pouring or Donnie Yen showing off his incredible martial arts skills, it still feels like something’s missing. The scenes feel empty, like pale imitations of the original.
And the film, in general, also feels empty. The camera lingers on scenes to milk the emotional impact that’s not there to begin with. Characters undergo inexplicable and unearned personal transformations. The plot marches forward with little rhyme or reason, and the writing feels bland, as though the screenwriters were just playing connect-the-dots with the outline of the animated original. The visuals are beautiful, yes; the sweeping shots of the Chinese countryside and lavishly decorated Imperial City are appropriately grandiose for a film with access to Disney’s pocketbooks — but all the production value in the world can’t save a movie without a soul.
Why this is the case isn’t a huge mystery. Take the matchmaker and training camp scenes, for example. These are wacky, unrealistic set pieces, tailored specifically to a medium where you can be wacky — where you can animate a matchmaker almost inhaling a cricket and burning her butt on hot coals, or where (with the help of a rousing 3-minute training anthem) it’s possible for a bunch of scraggly neophytes to become kung-fu masters.
The real mystery is why they kept those scenes in the first place. If Caro’s goal was to make a film that was more serious, more realistic, and more faithful to the original “Ballad of Mulan,” why stick so closely to the Disney-fied version? “Because nostalgia!”, some might say (Disney’s marketing department, I would imagine). But as a Chinese boy who grew up in the early 2000s, I can confidently say that the nostalgia for “Mulan” is not for its storyline: it’s for the spirit, the whimsy, the charm — all of which are painfully absent from this film.
But I knew this, going in. And I was actually pretty okay with it. The original would always be there, buried under piles of VHS tapes in my garage, fond memories of Mushu and musical numbers intact. It would be refreshing, I thought, to see a version that took a different approach, one that was — as Disney had so publicly touted — more respectful of Chinese culture.
Well, it didn’t really do that either.
The film is really more of a caricature of Chinese culture than a celebration of it. Take Mulan: a hero who’s supposed to excel because of her heart, her cleverness, and her character. Caro’s Mulan is made inexplicably good at martial arts, because how on earth could you have a Chinese protagonist who’s not good at kung-fu? And there’s also the concept of “qi,” which is explained about ten times, each making it seem more like the “The Force” than the actual Chinese spiritual belief, and ultimately serving as little more than an excuse for characters to snatch arrows out of the air.
Like that white kid in your East Asian Studies class who spent a summer abroad, it tries desperately to prove its mastery of the nuances of Chinese culture — with unspectacular results. No matter how many times it repeats the word “honor” or throws in a CGI phoenix, the film still doesn’t feel authentic. The makeup, the oversaturated colors, the overwhelmingly golden glitz and glam of the Imperial Palace — it all reeks so heavily of orientalism, like this white travel magazine fantasy of what China is.
And honestly, I was kind of irked. It’s 2020! How have we not figured this out by now? As the movie concluded and the credits began to scroll, I wondered: How is it that —
Directed by Niki Caro
— a movie with an all-Chinese cast —
Screenplay by Rick Jaffa, Amanda Silver, Elizabeth Martin, Lauren Hynek
— about an ancient Chinese heroine —
Costume Design by Bina Daigeler
— doesn’t feel —
Score Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams
— Chinese at all? —
Produced by Chris Bender, Jason Reed, Jake Weiner, Tendo Nagenda
— Oh. I see.
As I’ve said, I’m a huge fan of the original “Mulan.” Did it suffer from orientalism? Yes. Did it have its fair share of white overrepresentation? Yes. Was it a respectful and nuanced portrayal of Chinese culture? Definitely not. But that’s not what I expected it to be; I expected a Disney movie, with all of the caricature and whimsy and humor that that entails. If I wanted to watch a Chinese movie, I’d find something by Zhang Yimou or Wong Kar-wai.
The live-action adaptation tries, and fails, to be that respectful and nuanced portrayal, while also giving up on the signature Disney flair. It’s not “Disney” enough to be American and far too American to be Chinese — leaving us with a film that, to use an oft-repeated mantra, is neither loyal, brave, or true to anything at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You read that right. The Havard Crimson is officially a space for Black people.
Why? Because I said so.
Since when? Now.
Who gave me this kind of authority? Me. I’m Black. I’m on The Harvard Crimson Editorial Board. And, as already mentioned, I said so.
No, I am not advocating for booting every non-Black writer out the building onto Plympton Street. But I am certainly advocating for every Black Harvard undergraduate, who feels even slightly inclined, to come and bust down the (digital) doors to the comp and make this institution yours.
This organization certainly does not have the most pro-Black history. No, this newspaper, like any century-and-a-half-old, predominantly white-run publication, has been actively anti-Black at times. As a result, I could probably name most of the current Black members regardless of which board in the organization they are a part of — not because I am a particularly social dude, but because according to an internal Crimson survey, there are only about 15 of us out of the nearly 200 current student editors and writers who responded.
Naturally in that kind of environment, there have been the — hopefully occasional — moments where we’ve felt like the only Black person in the room. As if we, personally, were responsible for all things Black, racism, diversity and inclusion, and social justice. And that is tough. Or maybe we have felt outright offended, attacked, or unsafe without a support structure — or with one that just won’t get it. And that is even tougher.
So with all of this in mind, why would I call upon every Black student who has considered journalism to join this organization? That’s a question with many answers: Yes, it’s because I believe that collectively we can shape The Crimson to be anti-racist. Yes, it’s because I know about the hard work some members — many Black — have put in to make this space more inclusive and welcoming. Yes, it’s because I love writing for this newspaper and the people in it, imperfections and all. Yes, it’s because I believe that journalism and written work in general is an influential force that shapes our social world.
And yes — perhaps selfishly — it’s because I am tired of being the “only” Black person in the room and I want a (permanent) break from it. I am tired of feeling the burden of being a representative of all things Black both in the Editorial Board’s meetings and in my writing. This task of representation is impossible for any one Black person, but slightly less impossible for a group of us.
I realize that many of my fellow Black peers have decided against joining The Crimson for reasons of their own. But I must urge them — you — all to give it another consideration. Incoming first-year students, there must be so much more uncertainty for you than any first-years in living memory. In and among all that uncertainty, know that The Crimson is a space in which you can find security.
If you are Black and have ever looked at journalism of any type — news, opinion, arts, photography, sports, etc. — and thought “maybe I’d like that.” If you are Black and like the idea of investigating. If you are Black and like to capture the world in a creative way. If you are Black and have opinions or thoughts to share with the world. If you are Black and like writing in general. Even if you are Black and you have read something on this website (perchance something of my own) that has irked you. Then you are a person who should complete the comp to one (or many) of our boards and join The Crimson.
The Crimson needs you. You will love it, learn from it, and valuably contribute to the Harvard community and beyond. And while I can’t speak for the rest of the staff in certain terms, at least this one Black Crimson editor will love you for it too.
Marcus B. Montague-Mfuni ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, lives in Dunster House.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former presidential candidate Andrew M. Yang spoke about universal basic income, the spread of misinformation, and his Asian-American identity at the Institute of Politics’ virtual JFK Jr. Forum Tuesday.
Yang — the first Asian-American man to run for president in the Democratic party primaries — is known for his stance in favor of establishing a universal basic income. Dubbed the “Freedom Dividend” by his campaign, Yang argued that every U.S. citizen over the age of 18 should receive $1,000 per month from the federal government.
In Tuesday's forum, Yang spoke about support for universal basic income in light of the stimulus checks sent out by the federal government as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“[Support for UBI] grew a ton during my campaign and then it grew even more during the pandemic, unfortunately. Because when all of the business is shot, everyone looks around and says, ‘Well, I guess we should send people money, so they can survive,’” Yang said. “So we have this real-time universal basic income implementation.”
Yang, who previously worked as a tech entrepreneur, also said he thinks one of the most pressing modern technological issues Americans face is an inability to “agree on basic facts anymore.”
“If you're the average American of your age, you're not watching cable news for your news. You’re getting the news from your social media, and your social media feed is very much determined by what you clicked on in the past and who's in your network,” Yang said. “Something that should be very, very obvious — for example, wearing a mask is a very positive thing to do — there could be someone in Arkansas, getting a completely different set of information than you are.”
“We're seeing almost different versions of reality,” he added.
At the event, Sarah J. Lin, a student at the Harvard Kennedy School, asked Yang about his prominence in the Asian-American community.
Yang said he was “proud” to be the first Asian-American Democratic presidential candidate and now sees it as his job to “activate Asian-Americans around the country to get out and vote.”
“I think many Asian-Americans who are first-generation or second-generation in this country grew up similarly where politics was not the arena that we thought we were supposed to participate in,” he said. “I think that I could help change that. I think I can try and get our levels of political activation and engagement up, and I am thrilled to do it. I'm thrilled to hopefully be something of a galvanizing force for Asian American communities around the country.”
Another Kennedy School student, Nicholas J. L. Sung, asked Yang about a controversial op-ed he published in the Washington Post earlier this year. In the op-ed, Yang wrote that Asian-Americans need to show their “American-ness” and “do everything” to end the coronavirus crisis.
The op-ed received criticism online, with an article in Vox calling it “the latest to advance a misguided theory of ‘respectability politics.’”
At Tuesday’s forum, Yang said that “being an American includes lots of things, and we should just embrace more of what those things are in terms of public life.”
“I would never suggest that we are anything other than American, because to me, it’s as plain as day that we’re just as American as anyone else,” he added.
Alexander K. Park ’23, the political action chair of the Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Association, attended the forum and wrote that he “appreciated” the opportunity to see Yang at the IOP in an emailed statement.
“For many Asian Americans including myself, Andrew Yang was an inspiration during the 2020 Presidential Campaign, and personally, seeing Mr. Yang on the same debate stage as political heavyweights like Senators Warren, Harris, and Sanders, as well as the eventual Democratic nominee Vice-President Biden personally validated my lifelong dream of being an Asian American in politics,” Park wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Squash player Marwan T. Abdelhamid ’22 decided not to enroll this semester so he could preserve a year of eligibility to compete for Harvard Athletics. His teammate, Maddie P. Chai ’21, on the other hand, is taking online classes.
Faced with similar decisions after the Ivy League cancelled fall sports in July, Chai and Abdelhamid chose different paths. They are two of the hundreds of Harvard student-athletes who had to decide whether they would take time off, hoping to preserve an extra season of eligibility to play their sport, or enroll in classes and potentially forgo a year of college sports.
Abdelhamid, who is from Cairo, Egypt, said that, as an international student, he hopes to spend as much of his college career as possible in the United States and alongside his teammates.
“Playing squash in itself wasn’t one of the big driving forces that drove me to make this decision. It was the team spirit, the team workouts together, the team training,” he said. “I didn't want to miss out on this feeling — this camaraderie — between my teammates and the good memories we’ll remember from the college days together.”
Chai said she has already enjoyed three memorable years on the squash team — during which the team accrued three national championship titles — and has a job offer awaiting her after graduation that she cannot defer.
Though her job offer prompted her decision, Chai said there are also benefits to enrolling online, including using her time off from squash to focus on other interests. She is volunteering for Joe Biden’s presidential campaign, organizing the Harvard Votes Challenge — a group promoting voter turnout among Harvard students — and working at a restaurant.
“All of those things I could have never done during the school year, just because I am so busy with squash,” she said. “I looked at this year as an opportunity to use all this free time I have now that I don’t do squash and do things that I am really passionate about as well.”
For Abdelhamid, delaying graduation was less of a concern.
“Why the rush? Why the hurry?” he said. “I should just wait a year, try to be as productive as possible, and make the most out of this year and go on, hopefully once school is back next year, [to] enroll again.”
By “productive,” Abdelhamid is referring to playing professional squash in addition to seeking internships. He is currently ranked 182nd in the world for squash.
“I want this year to be a big jump for me squash-wise,” he said.
Fencing captain Cindy Gao ’21 also said her relationship with her teammates motivated her to take a gap year.
“Some of my closest relationships were formed throughout my time on the team with my teammates, and having a schedule and practice for like 20-plus hours a week is, at times, very difficult, but also very grounding,” Gao said.
She said she is training at her fencing club at home in Toronto, Canada and hopes to pursue teaching opportunities.
“When I think about Harvard, fencing is definitely a huge part of it for me. And I can imagine Harvard without fencing, but when I imagine it, it sucks,” Gao said.
The Ivy League has only officially canceled fall sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, but Gao said she is not hopeful that there will be a fencing season this winter, citing the University's decision to only bring a limited number of students to campus.
Though Gao is taking a gap year because she does not want to miss out on another season, football captain Jordan G. Hill ’21 said he believes he can enroll this fall — when the football season usually takes place — while still maintaining his eligibility. He said he is hopeful he and his teammates can play their season during the spring, given that several other college conferences are already playing football this fall and those that are not are considering playing their seasons in the spring.
If Harvard football does not resume this spring, however, Hill said he will consider taking the spring semester off so that he can return to Harvard next fall to finish out his collegiate football career.
In the meantime, Hill said he and his teammates are continuing to train on their own so they are ready to compete whenever they are allowed back on the gridiron.
“I have confidence in the guys on the team that they’re doing what they need to be doing, and at the end of the day we're still a very talented team,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House scheduled a meeting for residents Tuesday evening to review the College’s social distancing rules as some students say their peers have held gatherings by the Charles River and in campus courtyards that appear to violate them.
Mather tutor and community health lead Harita Koya wrote that the meeting would “clarify some misunderstandings about alcohol, partying, courtyard gatherings, compact violations, and disciplinary consequences.”
“I hear things have been pretty exciting down by the river the last few nights,” she wrote, inviting them to participate in an “honest” conversation about house norms.
“We will also be looking at a few of the rules in place for this semester and shedding some light on exactly what happens should they be violated,” she added.
Anusha Zaman ’23 — who is living in Mather this semester — said that while she thinks undergraduates have largely adhered to the College’s social distancing and mask-wearing guidelines, she was surprised to see “dozens” of students congregating by the Charles River this weekend.
“This past weekend, there's been a lot of partying happening for example, near [John W.] Weeks Bridge by the river,” Zaman said. “There’s been like dozens and dozens of people. They’re drinking from the same beer cans or White Claw cans. They're playing loud music.”
Zaman also said she has seen students gathering in the Mather courtyard, some not wearing masks.
“What's really striking is the amount of socializing that happens at night outside of the view of proctors and tutors,” she added.
While it is unclear if Harvard undergraduates organized or populated the gatherings, videos and photos of parties on campus circulated widely among students in recent days.
“@ the class of 2024: hey uhhh y'all maybe wanna be responsible so we seniors can still be on campus in spring? -- sincerely, c/o 2021,” read a submission posted to the Facebook page Harvard Confessions Monday evening, which garnered 91 likes from students. Harvard administrators have said that — public health conditions permitting — they hope to invite seniors back to campus for the spring semester.
The Mather meeting comes as Harvard has reported that just three of the 7,488 COVID-19 tests it conducted returned positive results. Just last Friday, administrators praised students’ respect for social distancing rules in an email announcing that students who test negative could gather in groups of up to five.
During the first quarantine phase, students had to self-isolate in their dorm rooms until receiving a negative result on their first test. Afterwards, they could take 30-minute walks outside in the area contiguous to their dorm in groups of up to two students. Upon receiving their third negative test results, students were then permitted to explore the Greater Boston area and gather in groups of no larger than five students.
The College will now allow students who received three negative coronavirus tests to begin socializing in groups of up to 10 while maintaining at least six feet of separation.
Students living on campus signed a Community Compact attesting that they planned to follow social distancing rules. In order to enforce the compact, Harvard formed a Community Council — partially composed of student volunteers — to adjudicate alleged violations. The College circulated an application to staff the committee in late August, but has not announced whether the group has heard any cases of student misbehavior.
Despite the weekend gatherings by the River, several freshmen say that the majority of their peers are adhering to the guidelines. Some have identified especially creative means by which to socialize and make friends, all within the College’s parameters.
Madison Pankey ’24 said she leaned out her window to greet her next-door neighbor upon arriving in her dorm room.
“That was my first real social interaction,” she said. “I started talking to him, and we instantly became friends.”
The two exchanged snacks and did a reading of Dr. Seuss’s “Oh, the Places You’ll Go” between their two windows. Their two downstairs neighbors have since joined in on their window sill chats.
Pankey said she recorded some of their interactions and posted them on the video-sharing app TikTok, where one of her videos sparked inspiration in masses of lonely students, racking up more than 619,000 thousand views and 147,000 likes.
“Honestly, everyone's in the same position. And what you have to remember being here is that everybody is faced with these rules,” she said. “As long as you're open, other people are going to be, too.”
Albert W. Zhang ’24 also said he worked within the College’s guidelines to meet his peers, forging friends through virtual problem-set groups.
“[The guidelines have] actually been pretty reasonable so far,” Zhang said. “I think the vast majority of students are following them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Arts and Humanities Division of Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, in partnership with the Mahindra Humanities Center, detailed the launch of a new humanities fellowship program in the spring of 2021 on its website.
The program — geared toward undergraduates within and outside the division — aims to “foster a sense of community and collective enterprise” through faculty and peer mentorship, internships, and guided development of writing and oral presentation skills.
Lauren D. Spohn ’20, a former representative from the Arts and Humanities Student Board, described the program as providing students with a structured pathway through the humanities that recalls her own experience as an undergraduate.
“The program starts by introducing students in the program to a broad range of humanistic disciplines, to moving into a more focused theory and methods workshop, and then helping students apply what they learned to real-world problems through internships and job opportunities after their sophomore year,” she said.
History of Art and Architecture Professor Yukio M. Lippit ’92 — who co-led the Committee for Undergraduate Curricular Initiatives in the Humanities along with Dean of the Arts and Humanities Division Robin E. Kelsey — said the program aims “to render more legible” possible pathways through the humanities.
“I think we felt that Harvard has unbelievable riches in its arts and humanities offerings,” Lippit said. “The work that the faculty does here, the courses offered, are remarkable in their quality, expansiveness, and rigor. But one could see that it would be a bit daunting for students fresh out of high school, where humanities often tend to be much more limited, to navigate these offerings.”
Spohn, a Rhodes scholar who concentrated in English at the College, agreed with Lippit’s assessment, saying she found it difficult to plan a track through the humanities herself.
“I would say with the humanities, you have to move out horizontally almost through academic exploration to find the areas you want to pursue at a more intense level, whereas with STEM fields it feels almost more vertical,” Spohn said. “So I think the challenge as I was starting my freshman year was trying to think about my path through the humanities, as there was less of a set track.”
Lippit added the program will emphasize building “intellectual camaraderie” among students.
“We wanted to offer students the opportunity to take arts and humanities courses in which the courses are not one-off experiences,” Lippit said. “We hope to extend the wonderful community that sometimes coalesces around a small seminar, extending that into later years and later semesters of one’s career by building this cohort of ambitious and curious students.”
Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Suzannah Clark said that while a virtual spring semester might “pose hurdles” for setting up the new program, she believes it is “imperative that we launch this program without delay.”
“It is even more important to launch it now when everyone is dispersed, while we are trying to create a community, than to wait for everyone to arrive on campus to have a community,” Clark said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The family of the victim of a fatal August crash in Harvard Square is raising funds to cover funeral expenses with help from two local government officials.
Fifty-five-year-old Darryl Willis, who went by “Pikachu,” was killed on Aug. 18 when he was hit by a tractor-trailer in Harvard Square while riding his bike.
His death was at least the second fatal accident in Harvard Square in under a year. In response to the crash, the Cambridge City Council announced a number of safety measures designed for cyclists in the Square, including the establishment of a bike lane made from quick-build materials.
Cambridge City Councilor and former Mayor Marc C. McGovern shared the fundraiser, which he coordinated, on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. McGovern wrote that Willis’ body has not yet been returned to his family because they do not have the funds to claim it from the Cambridge medical examiner.
McGovern said in an interview that Willis’ family had contacted former Vice Mayor Dennis Benzan, who subsequently reached out to McGovern for help.
McGovern also said the A.J. Spears Funeral Home in Cambridge had been working with the Willis family to coordinate plans for the funeral. The funeral home plans to offer a discounted rate to the family, so that they can “break even” on the expenses, according to McGovern.
Seven hours after the fundraiser went live, the family had raised over $6,000 of their $9,000 original goal.
McGovern wrote in the fundraiser description that he was struck by the challenges the Willis family faced.
“I can’t imagine losing a family member so suddenly, and have that grief compounded by not being able to properly say ‘goodbye,’” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Generational African American Students Association and the Harvard Coalition to Free Renty hosted an hour-long webinar Tuesday evening to discuss an ongoing lawsuit and campaign regarding Harvard’s possession of images taken of slaves.
Tamara K. Lanier sued the University last March over the rights to the daguerreotypes, which scholars believe to be some of the oldest images of slaves. Her complaint says they depict her great-great-great-grandfather Renty and his daughter Delia.
The webinar, titled “Lanier v. Harvard: The Power of Black Images & Identity,” featured several panelists, including Lanier, Grammy Award-winning singer George E. Clinton, and attorney Benjamin L. Crump, who represents Lanier in the lawsuit.
During the event, Crump criticized Harvard for using Louis Agassiz as the namesake of the Agassiz Theater. Agassiz, a 19th-century Harvard professor, allegedly commissioned the images at the center of the lawsuit in order to prove his scientific theory of white superiority.
The webinar also discussed the importance of ethical stewardship in caring for the daguerreotypes.
Lanier said during the webinar that Harvard’s response to both the case and her inquiries over the past 10 years is unethical and contrary to what an ethical steward should do: to “not resist, not deny, and not deflect from the issues.”
“I question how they could frame that thought in saying that ‘we are the better caretakers because we can afford to be’ and that ‘we are the ethical stewards because we have the property’ and not want to engage in how they illegally acquired it,” Lanier said.
Lanier added that surrendering the ownership of such priceless items would constitute a “huge transference of wealth.”
“In my mind, I think they’re opening a precedent where now we have to look at the nature of Harvard’s wealth and what other historic images they might have or what other artifacts that they might have that may belong to someone else that they would then in turn have to return it,” Lanier said.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the webinar discussion. In past statements, University President Lawrence S. Bacow has noted that the University makes only “nominal” profits in connection with the images. As of Sept. 1, Harvard will no longer charge a processing fee to account for charges associated with copying the images unless new photographs are necessary.
Bacow has also cited Harvard's work to reckon with its ties to slavery. In November, he launched a group to examine those connections.
GAASA president and panel moderator Samantha C. W. O’Sullivan ’22 characterized Harvard as “hypocritical” during the event. Referencing Bacow’s claim that Harvard has “the law on our side,” O’Sullivan said in an interview that she found the University’s defense to be largely based on flawed logic.
“The law was also on the side of slavery and what happened at the time,” O’Sullivan said. “So I really hope that people will take away from this event a legal understanding, but also a moral understanding and hopefully a moral conviction on the side of Tamara Lanier and on the side of descendants receiving ownership as a form of ultimately reparations.”
Roughly 100 attendees tuned into the Zoom webinar, though more viewers watched the Facebook livestream of the event, according to O’Sullivan. Throughout the webinar, attendees wrote in the comments section that they found Harvard’s actions regarding the case to be hypocritical.
GAASA began sponsoring the Harvard Coalition to Free Renty last spring. Since then, it has worked with Lanier to raise awareness for her campaign among the Harvard student body.
Citing recent national events surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, O’Sullivan said she believes the public’s focus should not be limited to instances of police brutality.
“I think it’s also important that we focus on all the other ways that Black lives have been oppressed and silenced,” O’Sullivan said. “And as students at Harvard, I think it’s really important that we think really critically about Harvard’s role in all of this, in the oppression of Black voices and Black ownership.”
Over the last few weeks, the Harvard Coalition to Free Renty urged Harvard affiliates to demand the images’ release to Lanier’s family. The group suggested affiliates email Bacow reiterating Lanier’s demands, submit videos stating how they personally identify with the case, and sign a petition to be sent to Bacow.
O’Sullivan said she hopes all Harvard students to participate in these initiatives, regardless of their personal identity.
“All of our histories — all the reasons we’re all here — are fundamentally tied to slavery, so it’s not just a Black issue, it’s an ‘everyone’ issue,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several Harvard faculty and students replaced their teaching and research with education on racial justice Tuesday as part of the nationwide Scholar Strike for Racial Justice.
Inspired by professional athletes who refused to play last month to bring attention to the urgency of fighting racism and injustice, Harvard faculty in Anthropology, African and African-American Studies, and Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights joined hundreds of academics nationwide in forgoing their work Tuesday, with plans to continue through Wednesday.
The two-day stoppage was organized through social media by Anthea D. Butler, a religious studies and Africana studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and Kevin M. Gannon, a history professor at Grand View University in Iowa. In lieu of their work, many academics are leading or attending virtual teach-ins on ethnic studies and racial justice.
African and African-American Studies lecturer Linda D. M. Chavers did not teach classes or attend meetings Tuesday and planned to continue participating in the strike Wednesday. Chavers wrote in an email that she joined the strike because her normal life requires a “necessary cognitive dissonance in order to pretend everything is ok.”
“It’s even harder at places like Harvard that prides itself on excellence,” she wrote. “Are we really excellent when so much violence continues to occur and we just go about our day-to-day pleasantries?”
“If there’s any opportunity where I get to be my full authentic Black self without a mask even if just for 24 hours I will take it,” Chavers wrote. “That is why I strike. So that I can fully breathe.”
Marcelo Garzo Montalvo, a visiting assistant professor of Latinx Studies, said he and other lecturers in Ethnicity, Migration, and Rights participated in the Scholar Strike because they believe educating about inequality is fundamental to their discipline.
“The second that I caught wind of the scholar strike happening, it was directly relevant to what we’re doing in class and I felt, what better way to be welcomed into my time at Harvard then to participate in this way,” said Garzo Montalvo, who started their visiting professorship last week.
Garzo Montalvo said he will not be teaching their class on Wednesday, instead preparing asynchronous activities and providing students with links to Scholar Strike virtual teach-ins. In another class, he assigned students to write a response putting their reading in conversation with at least one Scholar Strike event.
Garzo Montalvo said they think the Scholar Strike can forge connections central to the push for a formalized ethnic studies program at Harvard, which has persisted for nearly five decades.
He said many Ethnic Studies scholars have long seen their role as one of a scholar-activist, but having academics who are not often engaged in activism participate is an indication of a “profound and widespread cultural shift.”
“For me as an ethnic studies scholar, we’re doing this work all the time,” they said. “This is just an awesome opportunity to have that be valued and recognized as something that’s important.”
Some graduate students, including the members of the Harvard Medical School Genetics Anti-Racism Working Group, also participated in the Scholar Strike Tuesday. Hasreet K. Gill, a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular and Cellular Biology, said she decided to forgo her work to organize an all-day protest in front of the Medical School’s New Research Building, where a fellow member of the working group has staged a sit-in for several weeks.
She said the protest drew around 30 participants and helped raise awareness for the group, which formed in June in the wake of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of Minneapolis police. The group is pushing for Medical School leadership to take more concrete steps toward antiracism and racial inclusivity and has organized a town hall with administrators for late September, Gill said.
“The general idea that unites all of us right now is wanting to fundamentally change the culture of academic science so that it is welcoming and a place that will support the Black scientists in our community,” she said.

The clock doesn’t stop for anyone at Zoom Central — but what can be done for the unlucky ones no longer accustomed to Harvard Standard Time? Whether you’re an hour or two off schedule or logging onto Canvas at 3 a.m. every week, here are some tips for you to take on this remote semester with maximum efficiency.
Snap for Naps
While we all enjoyed a good, indulgent post-HUDS nap on campus, consider using those less-than-desirable habits to your advantage this semester! Mid-day or even evening naps will help alleviate any feelings of sleepiness if you need to be up for class at ungodly hours. By timing your naps so you clock a few Zs before nightfall, you’ll be ready to go for that midnight Zoom Breakout session without missing a beat.
Caf-Fiend
Whether you opt for a steaming cup of green tea in the morning or down three espresso shots in a row, get your caffeine fix right before class for that welcome boost of energy. Remember to time it (the effects generally last a few hours) with just the right amount (not too little, not too much!). You don’t want to lose the caffeine rush too quickly or be bouncing off the walls at 4 a.m. when your synchronous suffering finally ends.
Blue Light Blues
While blue light glasses are all the rage in this modern era of screen time notifications and Zoom calls, consider using that hurdle to your advantage. Studies show that blue light intake just before bedtime keeps you awake longer than if you had turned off your screens earlier. Consider this a “go ahead” sign to scroll through TikTok and embrace your cottagecore-filled FYP for a while with fewer regrets...just don’t forget to join your lecture when the time comes!
Endorphins, Baby!
Get that heart pumping and those muscles regretting by working up a sweat before nighttime! Exercise releases endorphins that keep you energized for longer, which is just what you need to keep you up for your online classes. Embrace the Chloe Ting craze from the beginning of quarantine or try some cardio yoga to stretch your tight muscles after sitting in front of your computer for so long. Note that endorphins last for just an hour or two, so consider just a quick workout right before class so you can hit the hay once you click that red “Leave this Meeting” button.
While we may be scattered across the world, it is still possible to use the words “remote” and “successful” in the same sentence when describing this new semester. As a final inspirational mantra: May your Wi-Fi not lag and your Zoom not crash!
