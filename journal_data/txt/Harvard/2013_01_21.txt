After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No recent event in American foreign policy has captured the public imagination like the killing of Osama bin Laden, and Kathryn Bigelow's slick, technically brilliant film "Zero Dark Thirty" is surely only the first in what will be many retellings of that story. It's no Hollywood hagiography—the plot is admirably devoid of cliché and the eventual success of the mission is shown in a mature and restrained fashion, in stark contrast to the wild celebrations with which it was greeted in reality. However, one problematic feature of the narrative has sparked massive amounts of controversy—the movie's depiction of torture.
Leaving aside completely its moral reprehensibility, it is now widely accepted by many in the federal government that torture—including so-called "advanced interrogation techniques" such as sensory deprivation and waterboarding—does not provide accurate intelligence. Despite this, "Zero Dark Thirty" shows a crucial piece of intelligence, the identity of bin Laden's courier, being obtained only after a subject is beaten, starved, shackled to the ceiling, imprisoned in a tiny box, waterboarded, and sexually humiliated.
Later detainees are shown being sensorially deprived and struck in the face until they confirm the intelligence. One agrees to give up his information because, he says, "I have no desire to be tortured again." When one character bemoans the cessation of the detainee program because it would have been able to confirm bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, nobody contradicts her. Doubtless though it is that part of the filmmakers' mission here to confront the full horrors of American-sponsored interrogation and rendition, the depiction of torture in "Zero Dark Thirty" does seem to deviate from the now commonly accepted narrative.
Plenty of ink has been spilled on this subject in a wider political sense, but what implications does it have for the artistic unity of the movie itself? Ms. Bigelow and the movie's screenwriter, Mark Boal, have been talking up the journalistic qualities of the film and their efforts to make it as true to life as possible—the oft-abused term "docudrama" has been bandied around.  There's nothing wrong with that, and for the most part they succeed. However, the aforementioned discrepancy threatens to compromise their artistic integrity and the veracity of the events they depict.
One could argue that the torture component of the narrative is excusable because "Zero Dark Thirty" is, at the end of the day, only a film, and thus able to use poetic license. Fair enough, but this would appear to upset the film's claim to journalistic accuracy. In the movie, then, what is actually true-to-life? How do we, as viewers, know? If cinema ever makes the bold claim that it resembles real historical documentation, then it had better be prepared to be critiqued as such.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After single-handedly introducing jazz to Harvard's campus more than four decades ago and fostering innovative student musicianship through his 42 years of service, Thomas G. Everett will retire on Feb. 15 from his post as Director of Harvard Bands.
“He is basically the reason there was jazz here at Harvard for as long as it has been,” said African-American Music professor Ingrid T. Monson. “It’s hard to imagine Harvard jazz without him.”
Everett arrived at Harvard in 1971 to manage the student-run Harvard University Band, which performs at Harvard athletic contests and University events. At the time, the campus musical scene he encountered was dominated by Western classical music, according to Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts.
Jazz, Everett immediately noticed, was strangely absent from campus.
“The department of music at Harvard was renowned for developing composers, musicologists, and theorists, but had not embraced more music of the people, music with social connotations, in the sense of popular American music and jazz,” Everett said. “I just felt that this was significant music—how could an educated person from one of the greatest institutions in the world graduate without some exposure?”
In an effort to fill the gap, Everett founded the Harvard Jazz Bands and began teaching Harvard’s first jazz course for academic credit through the Extension School. The course, called “The Jazz Tradition,” was later moved to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Everett also pioneered the Jazz Masters in Residence program, which brought a famous jazz musician to campus each semester to direct and collaborate with students. In the past, jazz masters in residence have included Maxwell “Max” Roach, Eddie Palmieri, and Benny Golson.
“I think he changed the culture of music at Harvard in some respects,” Megan said. “Bringing these great jazz musicians to Harvard was an enormous influence for our students and a signal that Harvard is interested in jazz. He made a lot of students feel that they ought to be playing jazz [and] made faculty think that it ought to be part of the curriculum.”
To Everett, playing music with a jazz great was an invaluable step in one’s musical education—an experience he likened to studying science with Isaac Newton. After playing alongside these musicians, he said, students feel that “they aren’t this imaginary sound, they’re a real person.”
Andrew S. Kennard ’13, student manager of the Harvard Monday Jazz Band, said Everett’s immense knowledge and appreciation of specific composers and pieces enhances the quality of sound he can elicit from his students.
“When you know something about the music, it gives you a more mature position from which to play the music,” Kennard said. “It’s so easy to just play the notes, but Tom really helps you to understand what’s going on behind the notes.”
Over the years, Everett has commissioned a number of works from famous artists especially for performances by Harvard’s jazz bands, choosing both well-known pieces and more obscure works that would otherwise remain unknown to students. The practice, Kennard said, encourages student musicians to learn from a diverse range of talents and has made him “more courageous as a music listener.”
“It’s always, ‘How can we make the music sound better, how can we play the music respectfully and still have our own take on it?’” Kennard said. “One thing that I appreciate about Tom is his lack of ego in this job even after 40 years.”
Megan echoed Kennard’s sentiment, adding that Everett’s manner of directing is symbolic of the way that a good jazz band works, with a regimented percussion section that still allows other sections to experiment and improvise.
“My sense is that he’s very precise with his students about what he wants, and at the same time he recognizes that in playing jazz, there needs to be room to breathe,” Megan said.
But students will not remember Everett only for his musicality. In addition to his tireless attention to sound quality during band rehearsals, Kennard says that the director is especially revered amongst his students for his jokes.
“They have that really wonderful ability to make you cringe as you’re laughing,” he said.
As Director of Harvard Bands, Everett oversees the University Band, Harvard Wind Ensemble, and Harvard Jazz Bands. He also founded the Harvard Summer Pops Band in 1972. Following his retirement, he plans to travel with his wife Betsy and write articles that shed light on underappreciated jazz musicians.
According to a press release from the Office for the Arts, Everett’s career will be celebrated with a jazz band concert dedicated to him that will feature two former students and musicians, Joshua Redman ’91 and Donald K. Braden ’85.
“We will miss him dearly, but I definitely want to be among the chorus of people thanking him for what he has done and making sure everyone knows how important his contribution has been,” Monson said. “We hope that, as the program moves forward, we will find someone with that same spirit.”
The Office of the Arts is still in the process of finding Everett’s replacement. Assistant Director of Bands Mark E. Olson will serve as acting director during the interim.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following their first loss of the season, the No. 3 Harvard men’s squash team (10-1, 2-1 Ivy) was able to rebound at the Pioneer Round Robin Tournament in Amherst and take down the No. 13 University of Western Ontario (11-3) and No. 23 Amherst College (5-7) on Saturday.
HARVARD 9, AMHERST 0
In its second match of the day, Harvard defeated Amherst, 9-0. Coach Mike Way gave reigning national champion junior Ali Farag a rest against Amherst, sliding line two player junior Brandon McLaughlin and line three player junior Gary Power up a slot.
McLaughlin defeated Amherst’s No. 1, Noah Browne, in straight sets, and only gave up 12 points. Power similarly won without dropping a set, defeating David Kerr 11-7, 11-8, 11-7. Harvard took the first seven lines without dropping a set, the closest set being an 11-9 third set victory by freshman Matt Roberts. Roberts played in the No. 9 position in the earlier match against Western Ontario but played line four against Amherst as five of the top nine Crimson players sat the afternoon match.
“The JV has had less experience so there is usually a little more nervous energy,” Way said. “The seasoned varsity athletes have grown up in the juniors and they have played tons and tons of matches so the JV tends to get a little more anxious.”
At the bottom of the lineup, freshman Jake Matthews won a five-set match over Amherst’s Rodrigo Quan in the eighth spot and freshman Peter Janulis came back after losing the first set, 11-7, to Kelvin Chen, and won the next three sets. Matthews won the first set, 11-7, before dropping the second, 10-12. He recovered to win the third, and dropped the fourth before taking the final set 11-5.
“I try to block out outside thoughts and focus on the only two teams and take it from there,” Matthews said. “[I] see how the game develops and work from there.”
Way said that the team has developed well over the course of the season and has bought in to the philosophies of the coaching staff and the direction that they are looking for the team to take in a year where the team has national championship aspirations.
“I just think that we have a happy squad,” Way said. “To have a happy athlete means that he likes the coaching and the program and it makes sense. Then they begin to understand what we are about as coaches, how we are trying to direct them, and what we are trying to do with their game. They understand we believe in them but some young athletes at places like Harvard are opinionated and sometimes you need maturity so that they see the bigger picture in their own individual development and the direction that the coaches want to take the team.”
HARVARD 8, WESTERN ONTARIO 1
On the heels of a disappointing show at Princeton that saw the Crimson fall to the Tigers, 5-4, redemption was a theme for many players.
“Some of the players had to redeem themselves,” Way said. “There wasn’t much to be said. The guys that didn’t perform at Princeton knew exactly who they were and this week was a terrific practice week for us.”
During the day opener, Harvard players blanked their Mustang opponents in five of the nine matches. Playing at his usual No. 1 position, Farag played a close first game against Albert Shoihet, 11-9, but responded by taking the next two, 11-5 and 11-6, respectively.
Additional straight-set victories came from No. 2 McLaughlin, No. 3 Power, No. 5 junior Nigel Koh, and No. 7 senior Zeke Scherl.
Sophomore Tyler Olson, playing at the No. 4 spot, was the only Crimson player to fall during the day. Olson was edged by Western Ontario’s Yeshale Chetty in four sets, 3-1. Each game was decided by just a two point margin.
No. 8 senior Jason Michas and No. 9 freshman Matt Roberts both fought through five games to defeat their respective foes. Roberts won the first game, 12-10, before dropping the next two, 9-11, and finally staging a comeback in which he beat Kale Wilson, 11-5 and 11-6, in the final two games.
Michas beat Adam Engel in a thriller during which the third and fourth sets saw each player lose 11-3. In the final game, the two players grappled for a win and Michas prevailed, 19-17.
“The standout has been Jason Michas, who won 19-17 in his final set,” Way said. “With a bad back and a sore knee... the win was actually critical because at that juncture we had a bunch of matches tied up. At that moment the chips were down and he led from the front as a captain.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing its fourth consecutive ranked opponent and playing on national television for the second time in three games, the Harvard men’s hockey team failed to generate anything offensively and fell to No. 12 Yale, 4-0.
Friday night's shutout at Ingalls Rink marked the third straight win for the Bulldogs (10-4-1, 6-3-1 ECAC), while the Crimson (5-9-1, 3-7-0 ECAC) lost for the sixth time in its last seven contests.
“By and large Yale was quicker, faster, had much more poise and executed offensively a lot better than we did,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said.
Yale maintained consistent pressure throughout the night on Crimson junior goaltender Raphael Girard—outshooting Harvard 39-21—while the Bulldog defense shut down the Crimson power play, denying five Harvard man-up chances.
That statistic marked a continuation of a season’s worth of struggles for the Crimson power play, which was second best in the nation a year ago but has been successful just 10.9 percent of the time this season—dead last in the ECAC by a wide margin.
On Friday, the teams combined for three penalties in the game’s first five minutes, but it was in five-on-five play that Yale was able to get on the board midway through the opening period.
Junior Kenny Agostino—who had two goals in the Bulldogs’ 5-1 win over Harvard on Nov. 3—fired a shot from the middle slot that deflected off of Girard’s pad to the left of the crease. Yale captain Andrew Miller collected the rebound and sent the puck into an open net for the game’s first score.
“We just weren’t ready out of the gate, right off the bat to get it going,” freshman forward Brian Hart said.
Later in the frame, the Bulldogs were able to augment their pressure on Girard. After the junior made saves on shots by Jesse Root and Trent Ruffolo, the third time proved to be the charm for Yale when senior Antoine Langiere pushed the puck out of a crowd and to the far post for his 11th goal of the year.
At the 6:53 mark of the second period, the Bulldogs extended their lead to 3-0 when Ruffolo put home a goal from the low slot following a Girard save of a Ryan Obuchowski attempt.
“We established a physical play from the beginning and wore their defense down,” Ruffolo said. “It forced them to create turnovers, and that’s what led to our scoring chances.”
As the frame went on, freshman Jimmy Vesey could not finish on a good look off a pass from Hart and two Yale shots deflected off the pipe. In the final two minutes of the period, the Bulldogs denied a Crimson five-on-three opportunity by clearing the puck thrice.
“They could have [scored] two [goals] there, and then [it would have been] a different game,” Yale coach Keith Allain said.
The Bulldogs were able to get on the board once again just fifty seconds into the final frame when Ruffolo put home a one-timer off a pass from Root for his second score of the contest.
“Yale’s a fast team,” Hart said. “They play with a lot of speed in their transition game. They were all over us.”
Ruffolo’s goal led Donato to pull the struggling Girard in favor of freshman Peter Traber. The rookie kept Yale off the board for the rest of the night, making 13 saves in the process, but the Crimson was unable to convert on a number of opportunities to get back in the game and the Bulldogs finished off the 4-0 win.
“We had some chances, but there’s no question that we got outplayed for the majority of the evening,” Donato said. “They deserved to win.”
Jeff Malcolm finished with 21 saves for Yale, while Vesey led Harvard with five shots in a losing effort.
“We’re just going to keep working,” Hart said. “We have a lot of skill and talent on this team. We just have to put it all together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off strong wins in dual meets against Brown and Penn the day before, the Harvard women’s swimming team easily handled non-conference foe Vermont in a Sunday showdown at Blodgett Pool. It was Senior Night, and the members of the Class of 2013 hit the pool for the last dual meet of their Crimson careers.
“We were all pretty tired,” freshman Kendall Crawford said. “We had a big meet on Saturday and have been training really, really hard, especially since we got back from Puerto Rico. But since it was also the senior meet, there was a lot of excitement… We wanted to make that day special for the seniors.”
After winning 15 of the 16 events on the day, Harvard came away with a dominant 232-68 victory over the Catamounts. The Crimson swept the podium in nine of the day’s events.
“I don’t think anyone was really intimidated by Vermont,” co-captain Brittany Powell said. “[They’re] a Division II team, so they’re not as competitive as our own league. Instead of focusing on the competition, we focused on ourselves and our own performances.”
In their last dual meet at Blodgett Pool, a quartet of seniors kicked off Harvard’s routing of Vermont with a first place finish in the first event of the day. Seniors Caroline Weaver, Mackenzie Luick, Ellie Johnson, and Carol Lin placed first in the women’s 200 medley relay with a time of 1:48.14. The Crimson swept the podium in the event, with a group of four sophomores coming in second and the freshmen team swimming to a strong third-place showing.
In the next event, freshmen Oriana Wang and Connie Hsu went 1-2 in the 1000 freestyle. With a time of 10:24.77, Wang narrowly edged out her classmate, who finished less than a second behind with a time of 10:26.39. Fellow first-year Daniela Suarez-Rebling finished in fourth in 10:32.38.
Junior co-captain Sara Li followed suit and put up another win for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Li later posted a close second-place finish in the 200 breaststroke. The junior finished 0.2 seconds behind sophomore Faith Martin in the event, who won with a time of 2:23.06. Martin also picked up a victory in the 100 backstroke with a time of 57.59.
Freshman Kendall Crawford had a pair of strong showings, winning both of her individual events of the meet. Crawford started out with a win in the 50 freestyle with a time of 24.07, then had a short one-event break before hitting the pool again for the 100 freestyle.
“I love watching the diving,” Crawford said. “Getting sandwiched between the diving [event] gave me a little break to just collect my thoughts, cool down, and get ready for the next race.”
Powell capped her Crimson career with strong showings in both of her diving events. The senior took third in the three meter, behind sophomore Amanda Largent and fellow senior Teagan Lehrmann. Then, in her final dual meet dive at Blodgett, Powell won the one meter. Freshman Emily Bonfig and Lehrmann took second and third, respectively.
“It was very emotional for the seven of us seniors,” Powell said. “We had done all of the ceremonial things, so I felt a little shaky on the three meter. By the time we were on one meter, my nerves were gone, and I probably had one of the best one meter performances of my career.”
Harvard currently stands undefeated in this season’s dual meets, having won their first six events of the season. The Crimson have a two week break before resuming action in their final dual meets of the year against Ivy foes Yale and Princeton.
“Being on the team for four years, I don’t think there’s ever been a team more focused on this last meet [against Yale and Princeton],” Powell said. “We are just so ready. I’m feeling great about the team’s mentality right now.”
Having completed most of its regular season schedule, Harvard is beginning to look down the line towards championship season, where the team will look to defend its Ivy League title and improve upon its second place finish at the ECAC Championship.
“We’ve been on a warpath all year for ‘operation repeat,’ to win Ivy’s again, and also to win ECAC’s,” Crawford said. “We want to win two championships in one weekend, and that’s been the goal all season. The way we’ve been training all year, we definitely have a great, great shot.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Halfway through sophomore Denis Nguyen’s singles match against Boston College’s Johnathan Raude, the Eagles’ No. 1 singles player hit a ball just long that won the game for Nguyen.
“Whoa, out?” said Raude, approaching the net. “There’s no way that was out.”
Unfazed, Nguyen responded, “Way out….If it was in, I would’ve run it down.”
This calm confidence carried the Harvard men’s tennis team through the weekend as the Crimson kicked off its spring season by hosting Marist and local foe Boston College in the Harvard Winter Invite.
The No. 28 Crimson started off the season in strong fashion with resounding victories throughout the weekend. The Eagles and Red Foxes didn’t have an answer for Harvard as the home squad won eight of its nine doubles matches and 18 of its 20 singles matches.
Several times throughout the weekend, the visitors’ frustration was evident in their body language, yells, and exclamations after missed opportunities.
“I think they came here trying to prove something,” Nguyen said. “We were high-ranking last year, so I guess they were trying their best to beat us which was good because it brought out the best competition in us. I just think our players were a little bit more confident going in to it.”
Play for the Crimson was strong across the board, with five of Harvard’s eight players winning all of their singles and doubles matches over the tournament.
“I think everyone on our team did really well in both singles and doubles,” Chaudhuri said, “It’s hard to pinpoint individuals but overall everyone played great.”
Denis Nguyen continued his impressive play from the fall season and helped solidify his first singles position with three wins over the weekend, including a 6-4, 6-0 win over teammate Shaun Chaudhuri to win the title on Sunday.
“The top guys played really well,” freshman Conor Haughey said. “Especially Denis and Shaun, who played each other in the finals. They played really well.”
Chaudhuri had a similarly notable weekend, beating out Boston College’s Johnathan Raude, 6-1, 6-1 and Phillip Nelson, 6-2, 6-1 before losing to teammate Nguyen. Chaudhuri used exact ball placement and shot selection to overwhelm his Eagles opponents. Playing doubles with freshman Nicky Hu, the tandem beat Boston College’s Nelson and Michael McGinnis, 8-2, on Friday and Marist’s Trym Nagelstad and Will Reznek, 8-4, on Saturday.
Sophomore Alex Steinroeder and freshman Nicholas Mahlangu won the doubles title of the invite, with an 8-5 win over teammates Nguyen and junior co-captain Casey MacMaster on Saturday. They had beaten the Eagles’ Johnathan Raude and Matt Wagner, 8-2, earlier in the day to set up the match-up against their teammates.
“Everyone from top to bottom showed up in practice ready to compete,” Chaudhuri said. “They performed really well in both singles and doubles.”
Hu and MacMaster, playing fourth and fifth singles, respectively, won every match that they played this weekend against opponents from Boston College and the Red Foxes. MacMaster did not drop a single set.
For the rookies on the squad, this weekend enabled them to participate in competitive game-play and gain match-experience before Ivies begin later in the season. Overall, the Crimson freshmen won 13 of their 15 matches in the Invite.
“A lot of freshman got to see some matches,” Nguyen said, “and we were able to get some more match play under our belt. It was about getting our feet wet for next weekend, when we travel to Oklahoma [for the ITA Kick-off Weekend].”
Freshman Kelvin Lam defeated Marist’s Naggelstad, 5-6, 6-3, 6-5, in one of the closer matches of the tournament. He went on to defeat the Eagles’ Billy Grokenberger, 6-3, 6-0, on Saturday.
Lam and fellow freshman Conor Haughey teamed up to defeat Boston College’s Grokenberger and Nelson, 8-7, on Saturday in doubles.  In singles, Haughey defeated the Red Foxes’ Billy Bishop, 6-3, 6-4, and Motta, 6-3, 6-2, but fell to Marist’s Matteo Giudici, 6-1 6-4.
Harvard, Chaudhuri explained, has high expectations for the upcoming season after its Ivy success in its 2012 campaign and high-rankings thus far in 2013.
“We had a really great season last year, but it’s hard to know what’s in store in the future,” Chaudhuri said. “We’re playing some really good teams this season, but I don’t see why we can’t do just as well as last year, if not better. We have a young team that’s learning more every day, so I don’t know what’s in store for the season but I know it’s going to be an exciting one.“

For the fifth straight year, the Harvard women’s tennis team (1-0) won its season opener. The team defeated the Cleveland State Vikings (0-1), 7-0, sweeping every match played. The Crimson came into the match with a preseason ranking of 74, a couple spots behind Ivy League rivals Columbia (no. 73) and Princeton (no. 71).
Harvard won every singles match except for one in straight sets, with freshman Hai-Le Kong surrendering a quick first set, 6-3, before taking the next set, 6-1, and the tiebreaker, 10-2. In other singles matches, freshmen Amanda Lin and Crystal Yen dropped only one game between them in dispatching Cleveland State players Ellen Folkers and Mengdi Liu.
“I think the team competed very well for their first match of the season,” coach Traci Green said. “I’m really impressed with their effort and proud of the freshmen with the way they hung in there during some shaky games.
The Crimson started quickly as co-captain Kristin Norton and freshman Amy He jumped out to a quick 8-1 doubles victory. Norton and He broke twice to open the match and quickly went up 5-0 before their opponents saw a game point. After saving two break points at 5-1, Norton and He lost two points in the next three games. Co-captain Hideko Tachibana and freshman Amanda Lin won their match, 8-3, to clinch the doubles point for Harvard.
“The freshmen have been gaining a lot of experience in doubles over the last few months,” Green said. “Junior tennis is a lot different than the college game and they’ve improved a lot over the last couple months. The main area of improvement has been the mental side. They are a lot more composed out there and that has given them a lot of confidence.”
Playing lines one and two for the Crimson, Tachibana and Norton struggled out of the gate. Tachibana was broken in the first game of her match; Norton lost serve in her second. After breaking back, Tachibana was broken again before running off a streak of 9 straight games. Using low slices and high topspin to keep her opponent off balance, Tachibana’s game elicited audible sounds of frustration from opponent Alex Power in a 6-2, 6-1 victory.
Norton broke back in the fifth game of the set and again in the seventh to take a lead at 4-3. Punctuating the second break with a fist pump and a loud “Come on”, Norton served out the set to take the first 6-4. In the second set, down another break early, Norton ran off five consecutive games to end the match with a 6-3 second set victory.
“Norton is definitely the vocal leader on this team,” Green said. “It’s only been one match but [I can tell] this team has a lot of heart and they’ve been very dedicated to improvement. We are a bit rusty but I liked the way that we were competing out there and I liked the way that we showed effort and determination.”
After playing the Harvard Fall Invitation in November, the team had more than two months off before starting the spring season. In the fall, the team competes as individuals—entering players in draws but not moving forward through the tournaments as a team. In the spring, the format changes and every member of the team competes together
“I think that today they had a lot of energy, a lot of focus, and they played as a team,” assistant coach Debbie Goldfine said. “With tennis players, that can be different. The team was focused on their own matches but they also had an eye out for others and even the people that were not on the court were very focused on what was happening and were very engaged. They worked a lot on match play and point play [over the break] and I think that made a difference today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a bittersweet afternoon for the Harvard wrestling team when it welcomed Rutgers to the Malkin Athletic Center Sunday.
Co-captain Walter Peppelman stood out as he became just the seventh Crimson wrestler to reach 100 collegiate wins in a dramatic overtime victory, but Peppelman’s individual triumph could not carry Harvard (2-4, 0-3 EIWA). The Scarlet Knights (12-2, 5-0 EIWA) swept seven of the ten weight classes and beat the Crimson, 26-9.
Coming off a 24-15 loss to Cornell on Saturday in which Harvard remained in contention for most of the afternoon, the Crimson struggled to contain the Red Knights’ after they dominated three of the first four weight classes.
“I thought that [the performance against Cornell] could be a big springboard, quite honestly,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Coming into Sunday’s match with Rutgers, I knew they were tough, and we actually didn’t match up well with them.”
The Crimson started off the day with a strong performance by Peppelman—who is ranked eighth at 157 pounds—who fought back from a first-period deficit against No. 17 Scott Winston to send the match into a sudden victory period.
The two were evenly matched at the start of the one-minute overtime, but Peppelman seized control after 50 seconds and took the victory, 4-2, ensuring himself a spot in the Harvard record books.
“Walter’s been a great leader and a tremendous teammate and competitor,” said co-captain Steven Keith. “I don’t think a lot of people realize how great it is. One hundred matches is a lot in college wrestling, and he deserves every win that he got.”
Keith—ranked 10th in the 141-pound weight class—did not fare as well as his co-captain. In his third pin of the season, Rutgers’ Trevor Melde picked up the win by fall at the 2:56 mark.
“I ended up taking a couple nice shots in the first period but got into a scramble,” Keith said. “The kid from Rutgers is real tough. He’s been around for a while, so he was able to catch me on my back and pin me. He’s good, but I know if I see him again, I have a good shot to change what happened.”
Despite picking up the first win of the afternoon from Peppelman, Harvard was unable to generate momentum. Rutgers picked up consecutive wins in the 165, 174, and 184-pound weight classes as freshman Devon Gobbo, junior Cameron Croy, and sophomore Josh Popple fell to their Scarlet Knight opponents.
The Crimson snapped Rutgers’ winning streak in the 197-pound weight class after sophomore James Fox dominated Scarlet Knight Hayden Hrymack with takedowns early in the match. Harvard couldn’t hold on to pick up two in a row when heavyweight freshman Nicholas Gajdzik tied up the score at one in the third period to send the match into tiebreakers but was ultimately defeated by Rutgers’ Billy Smith.
“Saturday night we won the close bouts, and Sunday we lost the close bouts,” Weiss said. “There were three close bouts that we lost on Sunday that if they go the other way it’s a different game. That’s the sport of wrestling. You’ve got to win the close bouts.”
After the close heavyweight match, the Scarlet Knights continued to pick up wins, sweeping the next three weight classes before Rutgers’ Ken Theobold dropped the last match to Harvard freshman Todd Preston in the 149-pound weight class.
Competing in back-to-back matchups on Saturday and Sunday, Weiss said that fatigue was not a factor against Rutgers.
“That’s the nature of our sport,” Weiss said. “Obviously that’s not easy, but it’s no excuse.”
In addition to Peppelman, Scarlet Knight Dan Rinaldi also picked up his 100th collegiate victory in an 18-5 downing of Popple in the 184-pound weight class. Despite his team suffering two consecutive losses this weekend and dropping four of its last five—with the sole win coming against Stanford two weeks ago—Keith said he was optimistic about the remainder of the season.
“We wrestled pretty well as a team,” Keith said. “Obviously we lost, but I saw some good things from a bunch of different guys. Some of the mistakes that were made are easy to fix, so I think we’ll be fine for the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard skiing team improved on an 11th place finish at the Vermont Carnival on Jan. 12 at the St. Lawrence Carnival at Whiteface and Mount von Hovenberg in Lake Placid, N.Y., racing to finish ninth out of a field of 16 on Saturday.
The Crimson accrued 314.5 points, sitting behind host St. Lawrence University’s 445.0 points and ahead of St. Michael’s College and its 219.5 points. The top three teams at the Carnival were the University of Vermont, with 1013 points, Dartmouth College, with 788 points, and the University of New Hampshire, with 748.5 points.
“The college races start two weeks later than they did this year and so some of the other programs like UVM get in a lot more skiing than we do early in the season,” Harvard coach Tim Mitchell said. “They had a bit more of an advantage than normal coming into these first collegiate races. We’re right on track right now.”
Harvard saw its highest finishes in the women’s Giant Slalom, where the team was seventh out of 14, and men’s cross-country, where they registered a fourth place finish in the 20k FS event.
Junior Rebecca Nadler was fourth in the Giant Slalom with a combined time of 2:03.93 over her two runs, just .0052 behind the overall winner, Kate Ryley of Vermont. Nadler finished her second run only .001 slower than Ryley.
“That was a pretty good finish, a step in the right direction from last week,” Mitchell said. “All of the women that finished in front of her are currently on or recently were on their respective national teams. Being behind one current Canadian national team athlete, one former Canadian national team athlete and one former Norwegian national team athlete is not too bad.”
Nadler was followed by teammates senior Catherine Sheils, who posted a 31st place finish, sophomore Liz Strong, who was 43rd, and freshman Samantha Udolf, who rounded out the group in 49th.
“We’ve all been trying to translate the things we are working on in practice onto the race hill,” Udolf said. “As a result of those efforts, the girls put down solid runs at Whiteface.”
The Crimson squad also competed in the Slalom event, where Nadler notched a 10th place finish.
“I definitely felt better about my results this week than last week,” Nadler said. “I think I can still do better but it was definitely a much stronger week for me.”
The Nordic team had top-15 finishes in both of the men’s events. Sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci raced to 14th place out of 87 entrants in the 3k Prologue FS with a time of 8:13.2 During the 20k FS, senior Anthony Ryerson, who was 35th in the 3k event, finished the course in 50:17, placing him 15th out of the 84 competitors. Ryerson was closely trailed by Maifeld-Caurcci who netted 18th place and a time of 50:32.
Freshman Annie Harvieux was the Crimson’s top finisher in both women’s cross-country events. Harvieux began with a time of 45:15.5 in the 15k FS event to place her 29th out of 85 skiiers. On the second day of the Carnival, she placed 42nd in the field with a time of 10:07.1 in the 3k Prologue FS. Harvieux was followed by junior Jen Rolfes and senior Alena Tofte. Rolfes was just one second behind her teammate and finished in 45th, just edging 48th-place Tofte by .004 seconds.
The men of the Alpine team also saw race time. While freshman Matthew Mansson did not finish the Giant Slalom event, he did compete in the Slalom event, finishing in 40th place with a time of 1:30.61.
“It was really tough for the guys right now,” Mitchell said. “The course conditions were actually very good and you’d think that would make it easy for them to move up. Unfortunately because the snow conditions were very good and the course set was not overly difficult, a lot of people put down very solid, clean, fast runs. When you’re back in the high 80s or low 90s, you have to beat a third of the field to even qualify for the second run.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A 20-point lead was not enough for Memphis. An increasingly rowdy crowd of 16,204 couldn’t do the trick either. But a fourth foul on freshman point guard Siyani Chambers? That was all it took to finish off the Crimson, as the Tigers dealt their visitors a 60-50 defeat.
With just under six minutes left at the FedEx Forum, the Harvard men’s basketball team was on a roll. After trailing, 36-16, earlier in the half, the Crimson rallied to knot the game at 48. During that stretch, Chambers registered five assists and knocked down two jumpers of his own, contributing directly to nearly half of his squad’s points during the run and facilitating numerous other baskets by beating pressure and finding open teammates.
After getting Harvard back into a game it seemed to have lost in the first half, Chambers was not allowed to finish the job. On Memphis’ first possession after sophomore Steve Moundou-Missi tied the game at 48, Chambers was called for a foul for being too physical with the ball-handler, his fourth of the contest. Worried that his point guard would foul out of the game, Crimson coach Tommy Amaker was forced to take Chambers out of the game.
“I was disappointed when he got that fourth,” Amaker said. “He’s got to be a little better, more disciplined, not to pick up that fourth, but as fate would have it, it happened, so we tried to get him out.”
If the freshman’s value to the team hadn’t been clear during the comeback, it became evident over the next three minutes. In his first three possessions as the team’s primary ball-handler, sophomore Wesley Saunders missed a tough shot and committed two turnovers. The Tigers took advantage of those mistakes with two fast-break buckets to open up a four-point lead.
With just over two minutes left, Amaker put Chambers back in the game. The magic was gone though, and the rookie didn’t have enough time to lead his team on another comeback, as Memphis pulled away for what would be a 10-point victory.
“I was trying to save him, but we were not very good when we don’t have him on the floor,” Amaker said. “We knew if we didn’t have him on the floor it was going to be hard for us to run offense and handle the ball against their pressure.”
BIG MEN ON CAMPUS
The challenges Harvard faced Saturday were clear before the game even started. During the team introductions, the Crimson couldn’t ignore the size deficit they were going to face when they stepped on the court. Five Tigers loomed taller than 6’8,” and Memphis featured three players weighing in at 240 pounds or heavier. On the other side, no Harvard starter is listed at taller than 6’6,” and sophomore Jonah Travis was the heaviest in the starting five, listed at 225.
The size difference played out visibly on the glass, where the Tigers brought down 14 offensive rebounds and tallied 17 second-chance points. Many of those points came on put-back dunks that electrified the team and its fans.
“They were just tremendous at climbing the backboard and having second-chance opportunities,” Amaker said. “We could never consistently keep them off the backboard. The kid [D.J.] Stephens is an incredible athlete and his tip-dunk plays I thought were momentum plays, energy plays, for his team.”
Meanwhile, the Crimson only grabbed two offensive boards and had four second-chance points in the contest.
Memphis also used its size to alter Harvard’s shots down low, blocking eight shots and forcing the Crimson into tougher shots the rest of the time. The Crimson had trouble adjusting to the Tigers’ size, which lead to its early shooting woes. Harvard was more successful in the second half, but, in the end, they couldn’t generate enough good offensive looks against Memphis’ defense.
BACK TO THE IVIES
After getting a taste of big-time college ball, the Crimson will now head back to Ivy play for the duration of the season. The experience of playing a talent-laden team in front of a big-time crowd will prove invaluable, even if Harvard can’t boast the road upset on its resume come March.
“I think [this game] will help us a lot,” co-captain Christian Webster said. “We’re not going to see a team like Memphis in our league. Just playing this caliber team and going back to play the Dartmouth’s and Penn’s…we’ll fare a lot better.”
Memphis coach Josh Pastner also said that the Crimson will see success in the Ancient Eight.
“Harvard’s good,” Pastner said. “They are very, very well coached. They’ve got good players. They are going to win the Ivy League. I think they will win it by a landslide. Not to put pressure on them but there is no question about it: They are good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
His opponent’s legs scissoring around his neck, senior Walter Peppelman found a last reservoir of strength, pushing upward to lift his Rutgers opponent into the air before turning the tables and pinning him to the mat. Peppelman’s victory in sudden-victory overtime was his 100th as a Harvard wrestler, making him only the seventh wrestler in Crimson history to accomplish such a feat.
“It was a hard-fought overtime victory so I was pleased with that,” Peppelman said. “It’s great to be part of a program that’s so special and to reach this milestone. It was a really nice accomplishment.”
Peppelman said that at the beginning of the year, he listed two goals for himself—win every match and win the national championship. He described the victory as a “pit stop” along the way but his focus is on winning the national title, which is decided in March.
Junior Erik Gobbo said that Peppelman is an inspirational leader who leads the team with the standards he sets. Gobbo said that Peppelman will identify teammates who are having a bad day and go out of his way to pick them up.
“He’s a great leader and an inspirational wrestler,” Gobbo said. “It’s just incredible. He’s one of the hardest workers in a room. He’s a great person to be a role model and he leads by example.”
Gobbo sees Peppelman—who has been a captain for the last three years—as an exemplification of the two traits that the team aims to emulate.
“When I was a freshman, we did something where we picked two words to describe the team,” Gobbo said. “The words were discipline and integrity and those are two things that he has stressed for our team and he is a great example of those and a great leader for our squad.”
One year in, Peppelman’s career at Harvard reached a low note. The Harrisburg, Pennsylvania native came to Harvard as a prized recruit and impressed on his first year of the team. However, before he could begin his second season, he suffered a partially-torn elbow ligament that would take him until the end of the season to rehab.
Instead of staying on campus, Peppelman withdrew from school for a year to maintain athletic eligibility due to the eight-semester limit Harvard enforces. When he had time off, the wrestler served as an assistant coach at his old high school—coaching younger brother Marshall, now wrestling at Cornell, and the rest of the team to a state title.
After the season ended, Peppelman was able to work in the office of his local state senator and travel to Russia to train. When he returned to campus, he competed in a different weight class and was named co-captain of the team as a sophomore.
Peppelman’s career falls ranks third in Harvard history and his 33 single-season wins last year is eighth all-time. Last year, he earned All-American status and finished eighth at the NCAA championships, honors identical to those earned in his sophomore year. Peppelman finished second at the EWA championships as a junior and recorded a win over the No. 3 wrestler in the nation en route to the final. Now a senior, Peppleman is ranked eighth in the nation and can reflect on his Crimson career.
“I’ve been in the program for five years and my big goal was to leave the team better than I found it,” Peppelman said. “One of the best ways that I’ve tried to do that is to give everyone on the team the power to lead and the power to influence on the team. It’s been showing up recently with people doing well and saying the right things both on and off the mat. Hopefully at the end of the season I’ll leave the team with twenty leaders ready to move forward.”

In 2013, you will probably have a lot of questions about love. These should be five of them:
1. If Ivy Leaguers are refuting The End of Courtship, are they endorsing The End of Empircal Reasoning?
 2. Which came first: The End of Courtship, or The End of Men?
 3. Was The End of Men before The End of Sex?
 4. Would you rather The End of Sex With Men before Courtship, or The End of Courtship with Men before Sex? 
 5. Is it a coincidence that, as we are battered with The Ends of Everything Sexy, we can turn manically and trustingly to The Beginning of Second Season of "Girls"?   
Well, the last one's a no, according to The New York Times in a recent article entitled "The End of Courtship." The article—which is hilarious, by the way—asserts that "hanging out" is the new dating, and that female urban straight 20-somethings who work in media or PR (it doesn't really talk about anyone else) are dissatisfied with their male non-suitors. "For evidence, look no further than 'Girls,' HBO's cultural weathervane for urban 20-somethings," writes Alex Williams, "where none of the main characters paired off in a manner that might count as courtship even a decade ago."
 
Luckily for y'all, newly released statistics say that the answer to the first question on the list is also negative. Even if you are watching 'Girls'—and you should be—you're probably still dating, which is, um, kind of weird, because we at Flyby know more students who are engaged or married than properly dating.
According to the ever-amusing college dating site DateMySchool, however, even in 2013, 54% of Ivy Leaguers say their ideal first date is still a dinner date. (Also according to DateMySchool, if the straight men going on these possibly imaginary dinner dates take physical attractiveness as a primary criterion in their selection of a date-mate, a majority of them would like those first date dinner dates to be with girls from BC.) And 74% of those Ivy League guys would want to cover the bill, even though 68% of Ivy broads are down to split it.
 
If these ideals and conditionals are confusing you, don't worry, they're confusing us too. But we checked, and according to the 2012 Senior Survey, 63.8% of graduating Harvard seniors had dated one or more persons.
So we just have to ask: WHERE ARE YOU PEOPLE? Maybe you're all just in secret relationships that are non-relationships, and since, according to DateMySchool, 96% of you would still prefer to end a relationship in person, rather than through text or setting a Facebook relationship status to "single," the world—and the person you were in a non-relationship that was actually a relationship with—will never know.
There's also a chance that the survey's "Ivy Leaguers" don't translate to "Harvard students" at all. Perhaps the statistics indicate that it's one of our seven siblings who's going steady.
Our bets are on Yale. Sure, two years ago dating for Elis may have been a "Sisyphean feat," but now that they have the good fortune to say no to bad sex, maybe they're also saying yes to dinner. After all, if H-Y memories prove faithful, New Haven has at least two good sit-down pizza places and may have also invented the hamburger, right?
