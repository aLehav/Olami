After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While Cathy Yan’s charmingly self-aware “Birds of Prey” is mired in sloppy plotting and poor characterization, it is also embellished with a flourish of indulgent violence, mischievous humor, and flamboyantly tinted frames that almost seem lifted directly from its comic book origins.
"Birds of Prey" is billed as a supervillain team-up movie, but ultimately turns into a Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) solo outing. Robbie reprises her role from David Ayer’s divisive “Suicide Squad,” complete with her overstated facial expressions, a high-pitched squeaky voice, and an inflated, theatrical physicality. Robbie is under no false pretenses; this is a character that lives and breathes like she’s headlining a cartoon in an unadulterated, unmistakable comic book film.
What’s so refreshing about “Birds of Prey” is that it isn’t afraid to act like a campy comic book: It boasts cartoonish characters and a cartoonish jewel-heist plot. At its center is a gloriously unrestrained performance from Ewan McGregor as the boisterous antagonist Roman Sionis (Black Mask): He's tempestuous, juvenile, and debaucherous to a fault. In other words, he’s the rare mustache twirling villain that truly works.
Aesthetically, “Birds of Prey” is a closer successor to David Sandberg’s “Shazam!” than to “Suicide Squad.” As of late, the DC Extended Universe appears to have realized that putting aside tens of millions of dollars for special effects may be futile if the film is filtered in such drab color palettes that it’s literally too dark to see them. In that regard, Yan takes a large step forward — “Birds of Prey” bursts with vivacious art direction.
“Birds of Prey” also takes full advantage of its R rating as Yan captures action beautifully with relatively long, unbroken takes and gorgeous wides percolating with effulgent color. It’s refreshing to see a DC movie rely on cohesive action set pieces that aren't stuffed full of fast, jerky cuts. Much of Yan’s action hits similar beats to those in the “John Wick” franchise, largely due to their use of the same stunt coordinators.
What prevents “Birds of Prey” from fully taking flight, however, is its storytelling. It is disappointing that a film with such a neurotic approach is held back by contrived superhero team-up tropes — and no, pointing at those tropes and having characters laugh at them doesn’t make them any less stupid.
Three-time Academy Award nominee Jay Cassidy edits “Birds of Prey” to instill a frenzied rhythm, aided by slow-mo, speed-ups, and transposing graphics on screen in the same movie trailer style vein as “Suicide Squad.” But what was mind numbingly relentless in Ayer’s film finds a niche comedic purpose in Yan’s. Yan’s film thrives off of this crackling tempo, but Christina Hodson’s screenplay sometimes sacrifices that tempo for character development. While that tradeoff seems like a good idea on paper, no character arcs are fully developed. Rather, such tradeoffs create an impasse in the film’s pacing, especially in the second act's extended flashback sequence. Successful action franchises like “John Wick” and “Mission: Impossible” avoided these problems by focusing almost exclusively on set pieces. Understandably, given "Birds of Prey"'s role as a (still rare) female-led superhero film, Yan tries to maximize her film’s message of female empowerment. But that message is sometimes lost in thin characters who can’t stop winking at the camera.
Helming a studio blockbuster for the first time is intimidating for any director: Josh Trank’s “Fantastic Four” bombed critically and financially, and the once acclaimed young director hasn’t released a film since. Simon Kinberg, who wrote four X-Men films and was even nominated for an Academy Award (Best Picture) after producing Ridley Scott’s “The Martian,” seemingly forgot all theatrical conventions in his directorial debut “Dark Phoenix.” Kinberg’s debut isn’t only incomprehensibly plotted, but also torturously repetitive, as the whole film is stitched together as shot counter-shot. Yan is not only the first Asian woman to direct a superhero film, but “Birds of Prey” is also her first studio film. Given the recent misfires of Trank and Kinberg, it’s remarkable that Yan not only manages to deal with the sheer production scale with ease, but also preserve her creative flair.
“Birds of Prey” finds novelty as an R-rated cartoon, but that trope wears thin fast, leaving the last half hour of big budget spectacle feeling more tiresome than fun. The DC Extended Universe has had a well documented case of missteps, notably the divisive “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Suicide Squad.” “Birds of Prey” is far beyond those films: While the film is not without its faults, it’s colorful, well-shot, and at the very least, a well-made action film.

There is a scene early in Autumn de Wilde’s directorial debut “Emma.” when Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) makes her friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) pose for a portrait that she intends to give to the local vicar Mr. Elton (Josh O’Connor). While Mr. Elton beams on obsequiously, Emma takes great pains in positioning Harriet’s limbs in a rather ridiculous, over-the-top arrangement. By contrast, her father and a family friend appear flabbergasted at this spectacle. Equal parts hilarious because of the mens’ reactions and endearing because of Emma’s naïve vision, the scene encapsulates the film’s cheeky spirit. Although it never strays far from Jane Austen’s beloved novel, “Emma.” still manages to feel inventive and fresh in a sea of other adaptations.
Much like the book, “Emma.” focuses on the famously clever, beautiful, wealthy daughter of a landowner. Because of her brains and beauty, Emma is the reigning social queen of her fictional village, Highbury. The film begins with the marriage of Emma’s former governess to a neighbor, leaving Emma alone with her hypochondriac father. Riddled with ennui, Emma quickly befriends Harriet Smith, hoping to unite her friend with the new vicar, Mr. Elton — much to the disapproval of her neighbor and brother-in-law Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn). Despite her best intentions, Emma’s vivid imagination and schemes erupt in all kinds of complications.
Novelist and screenwriter Emma Catton’s witty script successfully captures the most important moments of the novel. Her version is decidedly more romantic, as the relationship between Emma and Mr. Knightley is foreshadowed earlier than other adaptations, and ramped up with frequent intimate meetings.
The film draws much of its humor from the script’s dry satire and visual irony. Catton not only manages to translate Austen’s razor sharp humor to the screen, but she also succeeds in making her mark with some clever additions of her own. She makes great use of the bumbling but pompous footmen Charles and Bartholemew, for example, to poke fun at the stuffiness of eighteenth-century decorum. She also keeps the script light and surprising: The most entertaining addition comes at the film’s conclusion when, at the most climactic instance, Emma suffers a nosebleed.
Although she’s known for her music videos and photography, de Wilde’s previous projects have served her well: “Emma.” is visually exquisite and sumptuous. The entire work is marked by militant timing and symmetry, with actors moving across spaces as if they were in a choreographed dance. Entrances are coordinated perfectly with servants simultaneously entering rooms from opposite sides of the room, and the actors’ brusk movements are punctuated by the staccatos of the film’s bold score.
Helmed by cinematographer Christopher Blauvelt and production designer Kave Quinn, “Emma.” is a Wes Anderson-like vision, complete with title cards to denote passing time. Highbury, with its sprawling estates, is a lavish world where pastels and delicacy reign supreme: The walls are brightly coloured Easter eggs and the food is decadent and sculptura.
Costume designer Alexandra Byrne, in particular, should be congratulated for her detailed work. Though the all characters are impeccably dressed in accordance with their personalities, Emma parades around in a series of delicate, gossamer Regency-era gowns, whose laces and ruffles make her appear like something out of a Northern Renaissance painting.
This craftsmanship extends to the film’s cinematography. Characters are positioned in just the right way, so that the light plays off their faces to create a painted quality. During the ball scene, for example, Emma and Mr. Knightley carry out a conversation in near darkness with only a soft, natural light coming from the fires. The scene is highlighted by warm light which bathes them in a subtle glow and voyeuristically draws the viewer into their increasingly intimate conversation and relationship.
Though “Emma.” feeds off its incredibly talented ensemble cast — which features Miranda Hart’s unsurprisingly hilarious portrayal of Miss Bates and Nighy’s ridiculous, deadpan Mr. Woodhouse — Anya Taylor-Joy stands out with her incredible command of Emma’s emotions. Her face reads like a canvas, rendering Emma’s desires vividly and astutely. Her version of the character is decidedly more haughty and childish than others, but still manages to be endearing and quippy. In Taylor-Joy’s hands, Emma is just the right amount of insufferable.
Flynn initially appears less comfortable as Mr. Knightley, but over the course of the film, he settles into the role. This shift stems primarily from changes to the character itself, which feels re-invented. From the start, Mr. Knightley is presented as a sexual figure, a feat in part achieved by an unforgettable early appearance: a fully naked shot of him from the back. This decision ultimately works, rendering the growing relationship between him and Emma much more ripe with possibility.
Perhaps what makes “Emma.” so entertaining is its unabashed confidence. It could have taken more risks with script or characterization, but with its robust style and top quality acting, it doesn’t need anything else. It is a film that doesn’t second guess itself, and for that reason the period added to the original title feels critical: “Emma.” speaks for itself and doesn’t need any gimmicks to dress it up.

As recently as 1971, Harvard students under 21 were still fighting for the right to vote. That probably seems absurd now. Which raises the question: In another half-century, will it be equally absurd that 16- and 17-year-olds can’t vote now?
Last week, Cambridge City Council voted in favor of allowing citizens aged 16 and older to vote in Cambridge elections for city council, school committee, and local ballot measures. The home rule petition has been forwarded to the Massachusetts State Legislature and requires its approval before 16- and 17-year-olds can, contra Mass. state law, vote in Cambridge elections.
This marks the third time that the Cambridge City Council has proposed lowering the voting age, with the previous two in 2002 and 2006 ultimately failing in the state legislature. The difficulty faced by the proposal matches a pervasive national skepticism about lowering the voting age. In a recent poll, a majority of registered voters opposed lowering the voting age, and when Mass. Representative Ayanna Pressley proposed doing so as part of a voting rights bill, the amendment failed 126 to 305, with opponents expressing doubts that 16-year-olds had sufficient maturity. It follows that only Takoma Park, Md. has granted 16- and 17-year-olds the municipal right.
While the disenfranchisement of young people is certainly not analogous to this discrimination of people of color, a lack of maturity seems to be a weak argument that makes apparent a profound historical myopia. Racist limitations on suffrage have historically taken their most insidious forms as poll taxes and literacy tests, which were meant to bar black voters by taking advantage of their reduced economic means and limited access to education. It would take the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the 24th Amendment, ratified in 1964, to legally abolish these forms of discrimination. As a society, we rightly came to acknowledge that notions of voter quality or qualification are more often than not masks, easy ways to disenfranchise people whose voice is perceived by those in power as a threat.
Our society functions on the principle that individuals should have the right to collectively select their representatives in local, state, and federal governments, holding them accountable through regular and frequent elections. Expansion of those rights, therefore, merit serious discussions and reflections.
As such, we support granting 16- and 17-year-olds the vote, especially on the local issues that directly affect them, not on grounds of their capacities but on the grounds that it is their right to do so.
Still, we believe that granting young people the right to vote is a great opportunity to increase their civic awareness and engagement more broadly. Alongside this new civil liberty, Cambridge schools should spend more time teaching civics to help students make informed decisions at the ballot box. We commend the work that the Harvard Civics Program has done in that area.
Moreover, beyond first-principle arguments, we believe that lowering the voting age in local elections also provides practical benefits for local politics. Currently, many people are introduced to politics when they come of age in college, and, as a result, most of their attention is likely focused on national issues and their accompanying brouhaha, often at the cost of important local politics. The average local election draws one in every five voters, and 99 percent of respondents in an average media market never look at local news sites. If young people were introduced to politics at the local election before leaving home, they might well come to appreciate and form long-term and meaningful engagements with local politics, which many would argue carry more significance and impact than national elections anyway.
Lastly, as we champion the enfranchisement of young voters, we would be remiss if we fail to recognize the many people — noncitizen residents, undocumented residents, incarcerated citizens, or ex-felons —  who do not have the right to vote. Equally, they deserve a say on matters that affect them, and the deprivation of their rights is a stain on our democracy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The iconic bell tower of Lowell House looms over the campus, reminding students every day of the greatness of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877. In addition to this tower atop the imposing upperclassman house, hundreds of students flood into Lowell Lecture Hall for class and rehearsals. Evidently, the Lowell legacy is eternalized on this campus, regardless of whether students really know who the man himself was. However, Lowell’s actions in the early twentieth century raise questions as to whether he is deserving of the high praise the University bestows upon him to this day.
In 1922, President Lowell recommended to the Board of Overseers a quota system to be placed upon Jewish applicants. In the wake of the mass immigration of the 1920s, Lowell evidently was threatened by the premise of a challenge to the historically Christian, Anglo-Saxon tradition of Harvard.  Additionally, he denied housing accommodations to multiple African American students, claiming that “from the beginning, we have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together.”
Recently, it was discovered that President Lowell led a cutthroat crusade against gay students in 1920. In what is now referred to as the “Secret Court of 1920,” Lowell and Acting Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough found 14 men “guilty” of partaking in homosexual acts on campus, including seven College students who were subsequently expelled and asked to leave Cambridge. The main substantial evidence came from the students’ attendance at the lavish parties held by Ernest Roberts in Perkins Hall 28. Following the guilty verdict, two students committed suicide and the rest were left blacklisted from other universities. This year is the one-hundredth anniversary of their expulsions.
One could imagine the level of discomfort for a BGLTQ student, Jewish student, or student of color living in the house of the man who wanted them banished from campus. During the recent renovation, the Faculty Deans of Lowell House, David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser have encouraged removing a bust of Abbott Lawrence Lowell from the courtyard, and the portraits of Lowell and his wife were removed from the dining hall. The dining hall is a space to foster community among Lowell residents, and the new deans decided that President Lowell did not belong there. While the portrait of Lowell has left, one can find a portrait of his sister, Amy — a notable lesbian, Pulitzer-prize winning poet, hanging there. This seems to be an apt replacement of the openly homophobic president. Furthermore, Lowell House is creating a committee to research Lowell and ponder how to grapple with his complicated legacy today.
So, should Lowell House be renamed in order to cease honoring Abbott Lawrence Lowell? I believe this is not necessary, since the House represents the entire Lowell dynasty, not just the president from the early twentieth century. As one prepares to leave the House, the bust in the courtyard of James Russell Lowell, an important abolitionist poet from the 1800s, can clearly be seen on its pedestal. Furthermore, the portrait of John Lowell, the Massachusetts lawyer who helped draft the 1780 Massachusetts constitution, leading to the abolition of slavery in the state, hangs proudly in the House. To erase their name from the building would be erasing their legacy as well.
However, an interesting conflict remains: The University has not taken the same steps to change Lowell’s legacy as Laibson and Zipser have done as deans. In fact, in the Faculty Room in University Hall, President Lowell is one of few individuals to be memorialized twice — in a painting and a bust. Interestingly enough, the bust was sculpted by John Wilson, the artist responsible for the “Silent Sam” statue that led to immense controversy at the University of North Carolina.
Henceforth, I call upon the Harvard administration to follow in the steps of the Lowell House deans and halt the excessive memorialization of Abbott Lawrence Lowell. Ceasing to memorialize a figure is not the same as erasure; taking this step simply says that this figure is not worthy of our adoration. As a queer student, it frustrates me to know that the Faculty Room has a proud bust of the man who would have abhorred my presence in the Yard. Removing the bust — if not the painting as well — is a necessary start to atoning for a shameful part of this institution’s history. Until then, the Lowell bell tower will continue to chime as time passes while the individuals Lowell destroyed are forgotten.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The timeless tension in politics, that liberals think conservatives are evil, and conservatives think liberals are stupid, manifests itself once again in the current debate over divestment and the merits of protest. Between the clamors for climate justice and the complete condemnation of divestment’s goals and methods, I believe it is important to articulate a moderate position that attempts to clarify some of the underlying logic of both sides and work to bridge this disagreement.
To have a contained discussion of divestment protest, here are three assumptions that I take for granted: firstly, that global warming is a serious issue that warrants immediate, thoughtful action; secondly, that divestment is one of many means for the University to address this issue; finally, that there are better means for the University to address this issue.
I omit any discussion of my thoughts on the final assumption, the major source of contention on campus, precisely because it is so over discussed. It is my view that this emphasis on divestment misses a key point about divestment protest, and one of its greatest merits — that it is not just an argument about the merits of divestment, but a clarion call for climate action in general. I am against divestment, but for divestment protest.
The disruption caused by divestment protest is an essential part of this greater argument for action. The disruptive nature of the divestment protest invites comparison to other disruptive protests and debates over their moral equivalency. Why isn’t the divestment protest like the Vietnam protest or the divest South Africa movement? The moral argument implied by disruptive protest is not only the scapegoating of an authority figure, as some might argue, but more importantly, a general indictment of the complicity of the greater community for perpetuating the status quo. The sin of the greater Harvard student community is not the commissioning of funds for investment, but the sin of inaction.
President Bacow’s call for the protesters to utilize the proper and less disruptive channels of influence misses the effectiveness and significance of this moral argument respectively. On the first point, while institutions can effect change in gradual, systematic ways, they also have every ability to thwart change in a gradual, systematic manner. President Bacow can organize any number of proper committee meetings, faculty votes, and community-based discussions that result in the continuation of the status quo.
This capacity for delayed change, however, is not the fault of institutions as a whole, but the very strength of their design. Harvard cannot, and should not, immediately implement the next good idea that comes along, no matter how many undergraduates support it. This is because institutions are not independent, or even democratic, actors that can choose to “do the right thing,” but complex multi-headed systems with defined lines of accountability and express limitations on what they can do. Intractable, “evil” institutions make effecting change more difficult, but reversing it even harder, and thus help to create the ideological consistency necessary for lasting, structural change.
However, it is precisely because of their general tendency towards inaction and the maintenance of the status quo’s rate of progression that on important issues which require immediate action, like global warming, decisive pushing is necessary to reorient institutions towards the correct path. Divestment protest has shifted the discourse in Harvard to center around concerns of global warming; so much so that the president of the Harvard Republican Club has publicly advocated his own solutions to the environmental crisis. The effect of discourse shifting and conscience raising is not an abstract intellectual accomplishment. While President Bacow is right to say that there are other, better ways of saving the planet, his claim indicates that the protesters have successfully asserted the importance of their call for action.
A strong call to action is necessary to effect even the most moderate, reasonable change because as conservatives know, the institutional reluctance to “do the right thing” applies to its calculus of economic cents, common sense, and moral obligation. Despite the obvious appeal and almost universal support among economists for ideas like carbon dividends, Congress has still yet to implement them, in part because none of the respectable economists who endorse carbon dividends will disrupt a presidential address to demonstrate their support for them. The “dumb” liberals, nay the “dumbest” liberals, have often played an instrumental, if underappreciated role in creating the moderate, positive social change that most people desire.
The conservatism that I advocate for — the conservatism that supports divestment protest, but not divestment — is rooted in a deep skepticism of the most intractable institutions as well as the best of intentions. The universe will bend itself towards justice, but it shouldn't bend with the exact curvature and rate that the divestment protestors want it to.

Fourteen Harvard professors penned a letter to Oxford faculty Saturday calling on the faculty at the prestigious English university to support student calls to divest from fossil fuels.
The letter comes after students at St. John’s College — Oxford’s most richly endowed college — occupied the school’s quadrangle in late January, refusing to leave until the college divested its endowment from oil-company shares.
In response, St. John's College Principal Bursar Andrew Parker — who manages assets for the college — declined to divest the school’s endowment from fossil fuels “at short notice” and wrote that the protesting students were unwilling to make “personal sacrifices,” instead only “request[ing] others to do things that carry no personal cost.”
To illustrate his point, Parker also offered to turn off the college’s gas central heating immediately, according to The Times of London.
The demonstration caught the attention of Harvard Faculty for Divestment, a group of faculty members calling on Harvard to divest from fossil fuel investments. The 14 faculty then wrote the letter asking that Oxford’s faculty publicly recognize that Parker’s response was “wrong.”
“The Oxford community, and Oxford faculty in particular, should work to ensure that their debate on the merits of divestment cedes no ground to those who would mire us in endless rhetorical distraction,” the letter reads. “Faculty members can do so in part by adding their legitimacy to the voices of students.”
The University of Oxford did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment.
Medical School professor James M. “Jim” Recht wrote in an email to The Crimson that Parker’s comments suggested that the students were “hypocritical” for demanding “fundamental system change.”
“Sarcasm and self-righteousness aside, the bursar's comments reflected ignorance in regard to the scope and urgency of the climate crisis,” Recht wrote. “The required transition away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy requires urgent and unprecedented collective action.”
In the letter, the faculty members noted that during the debates on divestment at recent Harvard faculty meetings, even the most “diehard opponents” of divestment have avoided the critique of hypocrisy.
“[Climate change] is a horrible predicament to have to face,” the faculty wrote. “But the right way to face it is not to shout ‘hypocrisy!’ while burying our heads in the sand; it is to own up to our own unavoidable complicity, and to act as one in drawing it to a close as quickly as we can.”
Harvard Faculty for Divestment successfully pushed for a resolution that overwhelmingly passed in last week’s faculty meeting calling on the Harvard Corporation to divest the University’s endowment.
In the letter, the Harvard faculty also criticized a Feb. 2 Wall Street Journal editorial that supported Parker’s comments about the protest, noting that they were “a worthy lesson applicable far beyond the colleges of Oxford.”
“When most people think of Oxford, what comes to mind are images of bright minds debating quantum physics or the existence of God,” the editorial reads. “But even the brainiest sometimes need a lesson in common sense.”
The Harvard faculty wrote that it was “heinous” for the Journal to publish the editorial.
“It is a shame that the Wall Street Journal exhibits such short-term thinking,” their letter reads.
The Wall Street Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Harvard and its graduate student union reached three new tentative contract provisions — including agreements on holidays, employee assistance, and parking and transportation benefits — in their most recent mediated bargaining session last week.
Since union members returned to work on Jan. 1 after a four-week strike, the University and Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers have engaged in four bargaining sessions, all aided by a federal mediator. Despite the new agreements, the two parties have not yet reached a first contract and remain in contention over key issues such as compensation and discrimination and harassment proceedings.
In an update emailed to union members on Feb. 7, HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan announced the union had secured days off on federal holidays and over winter recess. Student workers will also be able to take religious holidays, one personal day per semester for teaching fellows, and 10 vacation days and three personal days for research assistants on a full-year salary.
McCartan also wrote in the update that the two sides reached an agreement guaranteeing access to the University’s Employee Assistance Program to all salaried student workers. The program — which is available to Harvard employees and their families — offers free, confidential help with both personal and work-related problems, including legal and financial assistance, mental healthcare, and grief counseling.
Medical Sciences Ph.D. candidate Louis R. Hollingsworth IV said he thinks the EAP agreement is “fantastic.” He added he believes mental health care and grief counseling are much-needed resources because graduate school can be a stressful, “punishing” experience.
“A lot of people are under immense financial stress because of carrying over debt from undergraduate or elsewhere,” Hollingsworth said. “Having a pretty modest stipend in graduate school coupled to the sort of hours that we’re working leaves little time to reflect and to really deal with the rest of the stresses that we have.”
The two sides also agreed to grant union members access to certain biking and parking benefits in addition to the discounted public transit passes previously offered, according to McCartan.
While the union and the University have made progress in negotiating a first contract, McCartan wrote in the update that the union faces particularly “serious challenges” in negotiations over workload protections.
“We’ve spent months working with faculty and administrators on Harvard’s bargaining team to try to set reasonable workload protections for teaching fellows,” McCartan wrote. “Today, they walked back on all of that. Now they say that all salaried workers, regardless of appointments, should be required to work up to 20 hours a week—even if they’re only teaching one section, and only being paid for one section!”
Sociology Ph.D. candidate Zachary R. Wehrwein wrote in an email to The Crimson that he feels the recent agreements are merely “commonplace for the rest of the American workforce,” adding that he believes it is “truly pathetic” that Harvard has only just agreed to them.
“Self-satisfied Harvard has never institutionally evolved,” Wehrwein wrote. “When your graduate program has for years assumed that everyone is essentially a reasonably well-off white male, then protections against harassment or discrimination or programs like emergency assistance or mandating a minimal vacation are unnecessary.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University looks forward to reaching a final contract with the union in upcoming bargaining sessions.
“Working with the federal mediator and HGSU-UAW, the University remains committed to finding agreement on ways to address concerns raised in these negotiations,” Swain wrote.

In light of a recent New York Times investigation into the increased likelihood of medication errors at major pharmacies, Harvard University Health Services remains committed to providing “superior, safe, and consistently accurate services,” according to an email from HUHS spokesperson Michael Perry.
The Times investigation, published last month, cited pharmacists’ concerns that “understaffed and chaotic workplaces” at large pharmaceutical chains like CVS — which has a store location in Harvard Square — make medication errors more likely.
CVS spokesperson Michael J. DeAngelis declined to comment for this article, referring The Crimson to the company’s official statement in response to the Times article.
“We fundamentally disagree with the recent assertion in The New York Times that patient safety is at risk in America’s pharmacies,” the statement reads, adding that CVS has launched multiple initiatives to improve “safety and employee satisfaction.”
“We work hard, every day, to earn the trust of our patients and customers as we help them on their path to better health. Despite our excellent safety record, we are committed to continually improving,” the statement adds.
Susan S. Nieh, who has worked at HUHS as a pharmacist since June 2019, said the HUHS pharmacy aims to avoid medication errors through their strategic staffing schedule. She explained that at least two pharmacists are working at any given time and pharmacists rotate throughout the day.
“Shifts kind of vary. I would say I mostly work the closing shift, which is only about four hours, so 3:30 [p.m.] to 7:30 [p.m.], but sometimes I get eight-hour shifts,” Nieh said.
HUHS’s staffing schedule and smaller patient population — compared to large pharmacies like CVS — contribute to fewer medication errors, according to Nieh.
“Our population demographics of the patients that we serve are only restricted to Harvard employees, students, occasionally elderly people who are on their plan at Harvard,” Nieh said.
“We only take prescriptions that are written by affiliated Harvard University Health Services doctors, so I think that really cuts down on the stress of the pharmacists that are working because we aren’t serving just anyone who walks through the door and has a prescription,” she added.
However, Nieh admitted that mistakes do occasionally occur but are usually “something small that slipped through the cracks,” such as a pharmacist giving a patient the wrong package for birth control.
“Usually the patient catches it themselves, and what we do is we will document it,” Nieh said.
Perry wrote in an email that the pharmacy follows “multiple quality assurance programs” that ensure the safety of the patients it serves. He also highlighted the stability and experience of HUHS pharmacy workers.
“We have very little turnover among our pharmacists and technicians, with an average tenure of 15 years for our pharmacists, and many of our pharmacists possessing even more experience outside of their time at HUHS,” he wrote.
The HUHS pharmacy is staffed by technicians nationally certified by the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board. It also works in accordance with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy and follows the performance standards set by the Joint Commission.
Nieh said that while HUHS does a “pretty good job” of preventing prescription mistakes, there is certainly more that they could do.
“There’s always room for improvement,” Nieh said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution Monday calling on the Parliament of India to repeal the Citizenship Amendment Act and end the National Register of Citizens.
The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed by the Parliament of India in Dec. 2019, provides a pathway to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian undocumented immigrants, while denying eligibility for Muslim immigrants. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) — which was established in a 2003 amendment — will institute nationwide checks for documentation of legal citizenship, once fully implemented.
In Aug. 2019, Prime Minister Narendra D. Modi’s far-right Bharatiya Janata Party government began to use the NRC to force nearly 2 million people in the Indian state of Assam to prove their citizenship or face detention and deportation.
The Citizenship Amendment Act and the NRC sparked demonstrations from students across India, protests which the Indian government attempted to shut down by setting curfews, shutting down internet access, and deploying authorities to enforce order.
The actions of India's government quickly sparked protests across the globe.
In December, Harvard affiliates signed a letter supporting protests against the CAA and condemning the suppression of student protests at Indian universities. Harvard affiliates also staged a 24-hour protest against the CAA in January.
The City Council’s resolution — which passed unanimously Monday evening — identifies the Modi regime’s “racist” and “repressive” policies as being “inconsistent with Cambridge’s values as a city that welcomes South Asian communities of all castes and religions.”
The resolution calls on the Parliament of India to “uphold the Indian constitution” by repealing the CAA and ending the NRC.
The Indian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.
Moreover, the policy order urges Cambridge’s congressional delegation “to support legislation censuring the Republic of India for adopting these policies.”
More than 10 Cambridge residents spoke about their support of the resolution during the public comment section of the council meeting.
Kashif Ul-Huda, a Cambridge resident and Muslim immigrant from India, spoke to the significance of promoting love and acceptance in response to the CAA and NRC.
“The discriminatory laws being put in place will make millions of people — not just Muslims — illegal in their own lands, for lack of proper documentation, or even minor errors in their documents,” Ul-Huda said.
He encouraged city councilors to adopt the resolution in order to communicate that Cambridge “preaches love and acceptance, and rejects hate.”
Multiple residents said that Cambridge has a unique obligation to condemn the actions of Indian’s government.
“This city is the home of illustrious institutions like Harvard and MIT, the upcoming internationally renowned Harvard India Conference, incredible community leaders, and a legacy of innovation,” Cambridge resident Payal Kumar said.
“We have a responsibility to use our platforms and privileges to speak to these struggles, especially when our resources here in Cambridge are so intimately tied to them,” they added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Harvard College athletes told members of the search advisory committee for the next Athletics Director they hope the committee’s pick will be responsive to athletes’ concerns and set high standards for the program in a meeting at the end of last month.
In October of 2019, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise announced he would step down from his post at the end of the academic year after heading the department for nearly two decades. In November, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay launched a search advisory committee comprised of six administrators across the University to select Scalise’s successor.
On Jan. 29, more than two dozen student-athletes — including captains and members of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee across an array of sports teams — sat down with the search advisory committee’s chair and former Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and committee members Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Gwill E. York ’79, the former Vice Chair of the Harvard Board of Overseers, according to SAAC Co-President Matt R. Thomas ’21, who attended the meeting.
Thomas said the group of athletes who attended said they hope the next Athletics Director will monitor the “pulse of the student body.”
“I think one thing we've really liked in Bob was his openness and communication and availability to students,” Thomas said.
He added that he hopes Scalise’s successor will be receptive to student concerns, pinpointing athletes’ concerns regarding scheduling conflicts and food inaccessibility.
SAAC member Sam B. Scherl ’21, who also attended the meeting, said he spoke about the importance of pride in Harvard athletics at the meeting.
“Harvard should have the same level of pride it would in its athletic teams and the athletic director should have that same level pride in athletic teams as they would with the speech and debate team and the orchestra,” he said. “As Harvard, I think we really should strive to be the best in whatever we do. That's part of the Harvard brand and that should extend to athletics.”
Other athletes said they shared Scherl’s belief that the forthcoming Athletics Director should emphasize excellence in non-academic pursuits.
Mimi F. Tarrant ’21 said her top priority in the forthcoming Athletics Director is an appointee who sets high standards for athletic achievement. During the 2019 season, Tarrant captained Harvard’s field hockey team, which is ranked among the top 20 collegiate programs in the country.
“I want an AD that inspires not just the students but the coaches and the administration to not let Harvard slip into a school where the standards are closer to a D3 than a D1,” she said.
SAAC Co-President Madison J. H. Earle ’20, who is also a president of Women of Harvard Athletics, said she hopes the next Athletics Director will come to Cambridge from a nationally acclaimed college athletics program, such as a school in the Big Ten or American Athletic Conference.
Earle added that she wants the next Athletics Director to align Harvard with “modern athletics,” citing conversations surrounding whether collegiate athletes should receive compensation — a contentious subject in college sports that Scalise has previously denounced.
Gay wrote in an emailed statement that meetings between the search advisory committee and Harvard affiliates — including student-athletes — have been effective.
“These meetings have offered important insights into the qualities and experiences the next leader will need to be successful, as well as top priorities once appointed,” she wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of undergraduates formed the Harvard Jewish Coalition for Peace, an "anti-Zionist" group that aims to show solidarity with the Palestinian people and combat anti-Semitism.
The coalition bills itself as an “anti-Zionist Jewish organization” focused on countering anti-Semitism through supporting marginalized groups and creating spaces and events for Jewish students outside of Harvard Hillel, according to a public statement on the organization’s Facebook page.
“Harvard Jewish Coalition for Peace is a new organization founded in the idea that Jewish liberation is inextricably bound up with the liberation of all people,” the statement reads.
The coalition was founded after debates over human rights for Palestinians during “Israeli Apartheid Week” — organized by the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee — in spring 2019.
“We build on a long history of Jewish anti-Zionism which teaches us that Jewish safety or liberation will never come at the expense of other people’s lives and land, and are committed to following the leadership of Palestinians in supporting the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement on and off Harvard’s campus,” the organization’s statement reads.
BDS is an international movement that works to “end international support for Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and pressure Israel to comply with international law,” according to its website.
An announcement for the coalition’s inaugural event — titled “The Jewish Case for BDS” — over the Hillel email list quickly drew criticisms on Saturday.
Caleb J. Esrig ’20 replied over the email list that he found it “immensely disappointing” to see the message sent during Shabbat, a time during which some Jewish people refrain from using technology.
Esrig — a former Crimson editorial editor — also said in a Monday interview that he disagrees with the BDS movement.
“At the end of the day, BDS is not about human rights or social justice,” Esrig said. “It is not about ending the occupation. It's not about Israeli human rights abuses. It is about ending the Jewish state.”
Sarah Bolnick ’23 wrote in an email that she was similarly “distressed” by the new organization’s messaging and platform.
“Even if they claim that they’re committed to fighting anti-Semitism, this new organization is, even if unwittingly, alligning themselves with groups that have historically sought the oppression of Jews,” Bolnick, a Crimson editorial board member, wrote. “To oppose Israel’s policies or government is one thing. To reject its legitimacy is quite another.”
Hillel President Rebecca S. Araten ’22 wrote in email that Hillel is committed to an “active and constructive relationship” with Israel, rather than one of “alienation and vilification.”
“Israel is a vital crucible of modern Jewish culture and the home of nearly half of the world’s Jewish population,” she wrote. “We oppose BDS and all efforts that seek to delegitimize the State of Israel.”
The coalition’s public statement also stated that it does not claim to represent the majority of Jewish students at Harvard, but hopes to offer a space for those who agree with its mission and have felt “alienated” by Harvard Hillel.
Araten, a former Crimson editor, wrote that Hillel seeks to accomodate a broad spectrum of political and ethical thought on Israel-Palestine relations.
“As a community, Harvard Hillel is dedicated to inclusive, multi-vocal conversation about Israel,” she said. “Students active in our community represent a diversity of voices and political opinions, which we amplify in programming that seeks to explore the different facets of Israel.”
Correction: February 11, 2020
A previous version of the caption for this article stated that the Jewish Coalition for Peace meets in the PBHA building. In fact, it will hold its first meeting in the PBH building.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — Coming off a dramatic comeback win against Colgate on Saturday, Harvard entered the Beanpot consolation looking to add a quality non-conference win to its resume. In an earlier meeting on Dec. 31, the Crimson went on the road to Boston College and soundly defeated the Eagles, pushing the margin to a 7-1 victory over the then top-10 team. In Tuesday’s contest, however, BC capitalized on the opportunity for revenge. After falling to a 3-0 deficit, Harvard only mustered one goal in response as the Eagles soared to a 3-1 victory.
“When teams beat us pretty bad, we kind of get that motivation to...just work harder than them,” said BC first-year forward Hannah Bilka. “Once we get in our groove, I don’t think anyone can beat us.”
Harvard (13-11-1, 12-5-1 ECAC) started off strong, with junior Becca Gilmore firing a high-quality shot on goal just 15 seconds into the game, establishing an offensive presence that lasted through the first period. Despite controlling much of the time of possession and holding a shots-on-goal advantage for essentially the entire opening period, the Crimson did not manage to convert as BC (15-12-3, 13-9-2 WHEA) outlasted the Harvard pressure. Several offensive zone rushes culminated in scrums in front of the Eagle net, but BC’s sophomore goalie Kelly Pickreign pounced on loose pucks before any Harvard attacker could capitalize. On the afternoon, Pickreign, who had only played in 11 games prior to Tuesday, saved 36 of 37 shots on goal.
However, the tone on the ice shifted as Harvard sophomore forward Dominique Petrie headed to the penalty box for hooking with 10:48 remaining in the first. On the ensuing power play, BC would take only one shot—just its second of the game at that point—but would make that shot count. After sophomore forward Kelly Browne delivered a centering pass, freshman defender Alexie Guay hesitated and deked the Harvard defender, setting up an open shot in the slot that beamed over Harvard senior goalie Beth Larcom’s glove and into the top corner.
“I thought that power play was huge,” said Eagles head coach Katie Crowley. “We’ve had great scoring opportunities on our power play. We just haven’t been able to put one in… I thought that really kick-started us offensively and got us rolling a little bit. Obviously, one of the keys to our game was scoring first. That was huge for our bench and huge for our team to just celebrate scoring first and being able to play with the lead for a little bit.”
The second period would see the Eagles offense continuing to find its groove despite the shots-on-goal deficit. Just 3:41 into the middle frame, BC assistant captain and forward Delaney Belinskas received a pass from sophomore defender Cayla Barnes and opted to rifle the puck along the ice rather than take another look at the back door. The decision proved to be the right one as the puck glided along the ice and through Larcom’s five-hole. After doubling their lead in the initial minutes of the second, the Eagles would add their third tally of the game. On a point blast from first-year defender Hadley Hartmetz, Bilka turned her hands over to redirect the shot just past Larcom’s toe and inside the post. The second period opened with a close 1-0 match but finished with a comfortable BC lead.
“Make an extra play, get the puck stripped, don’t protect the puck, you know, just pretty soft plays,” described Harvard head coach Katey Stone of the Crimson’s second period performance. “At the end of the day, we made too many soft plays tonight.”
The Crimson managed a brief offensive resurgence in the final stanza, as a flurry of two-on-one’s and breakaways resulted in the team’s only score of the night. Tic-tac-toe passing culminated with sophomore forward Anne Bloomer sliding the puck across the net to fellow sophomore forward Kristin Della-Rovere, who flicked the puck into an open net. Despite gaining back some momentum after the goal, Harvard failed to convert any further attempts. The Crimson consistently broke away down the ice, maneuvering the puck in front of the net. Nonetheless, each shot sailed wide, flew straight at Pickreign, or was fended off by the goaltender’s quick reaction.
With 2:05 left in the game, Larcom headed to the bench as Harvard attempted a desperate comeback. Despite a flurry of shots, including a backdoor attempt by sophomore defender Maryna Macdonald and a close scuffle at the net with 22 seconds remaining, the score remained 3-1. The Eagles’ strong defense made it difficult for the Crimson to pull off clean looks. Often, when a Harvard skater closed in on Pickreign, a BC defender would swoop in to thwart the attempt. Ultimately, as the buzzer signaled the third period’s close, Harvard fell 3-1 despite winning 41 of 64 faceoffs and leading 37-25 in shots on goal.
“Just about every shot we took the goaltender saw like a beach ball. We didn’t have any traffic in front,” Stone commented. “We didn’t take shots for rebounds. We did not make her [Pickreign’s] night as difficult as it could’ve been.”
Heading into the game, the Crimson looked to extend the momentum it had built over the weekend during a dramatic comeback against Colgate. Nonetheless, Harvard did not replicate the same spirited effort and will have to regroup in away conference games against Rensselaer and Union this weekend.
“I think we were trying to be too fancy at the beginning of the game,” explained Stone when asked about the contrast between tonight’s game and the Crimson’s victory against Colgate. “It’s a little bit of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde at times, but BC had the better of us tonight.”
That said, Tuesday’s loss does not take away from the critical and improbable nature of Harvard’s win on Saturday. With under three minutes remaining in the contest, the Crimson found itself trailing by a goal until junior forward Keely Moy provided the late-game heroics. With 2:48 left in the game, Moy collected a rebound off the end boards and deposited the puck into the open net. Just 1:21 later, Moy completed the comeback with a highlight-worthy game-winner to complement her game-tying goal. Skating towards the blue line, Moy doubled back into the zone along the boards before cutting to the slot and finding a soft spot in the defense. With Colgate defenders crashing in, she ripped the puck along the ice for the score, propelling Harvard to a 4-3 final.
Moy would not be the only impact player for the Crimson. Junior goalie Becky Dutton—who had just tallied 35 saves in the Beanpot semifinals—turned away 38 of the 41 shots on goal that came her way. In a small sample size of just four starts, Dutton has posted a 0.949 save percentage and a 1.62 goals against average. Likewise, in her first game back from injury, sophomore forward and lead point scorer Dominique Petrie contributed two assists to Harvard’s victory over Colgate.
“[Having Petrie back] helps us a lot. She’s a dominant player and she’s probably one of the best forecheckers we’ve ever had,” Stone said.
Taken together, Saturday and Tuesday’s games represent opposite trends for the Crimson, though both rematches contrasted their earlier season meeting In Harvard’s first match against Colgate on Jan. 17, the Raiders gained a two-goal lead in the third and protected it until adding an empty-netter for a 5-2 win. On Saturday, Harvard would avenge the loss with a third-period flurry of its own. On Tuesday, the Crimson would be the target of another team’s payback as the Eagles converted their 7-1 defeat into a 3-1 triumph.
Unlike BC, however, Colgate plays in the ECAC as well and seemed to be approaching Harvard in the standings. A win for the Raiders would have drawn the squad to within two points of the Crimson, challenging Harvard’s fourth-place conference position and allowing three teams (Yale, Quinnipiac, and Colgate) within three points. The top four positions take on added importance as these four teams earn home-ice advantage for the ECAC quarterfinals. With four games left to play in the regular season, Harvard certainly controls its destiny as it strives to hold the fourth spot and even gain the third (the Crimson sit only one spot behind Clarkson, with whom it will have a head-to-head matchup at Bright-Landry in the final weekend of the season). On the other hand, the Bulldogs, Bobcats, and even the Raiders can overtake Harvard, giving the team a clear mission for its final stretch.
“We’ve got to be better. We only have 29 regular season games to play and every single one of them is huge. Whether it’s on a Tuesday night or Friday night or Saturday afternoon, we’ve got to show up.” Stone said. “Now, we have an opportunity with four league games left to get a home-ice playoff series that’s in our hands and see what we’re made of.”
