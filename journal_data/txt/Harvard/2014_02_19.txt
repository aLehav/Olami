“Red-Eye to Havre de Grace,” playing Feb. 13 to 16 at the Emerson/Paramount Center Mainstage by theater collective Lucidity Suitcase Intercontinental, is a spellbinding, visually stunning depiction of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allan Poe. A tense exploration of grief, loneliness, and the pitfalls of genius, the musical quickly draws in the audience and doesn’t let go.
 
The production begins as Poe (Ean Sheehy) boards a train to Philadelphia in order to give a presentation to the Pennsylvania Literary Society. Although lonely, awkward, and depressed, he seems to be of sound mind, yet as the production continues, the audience sees the threads holding him together start to fray primarily due to the ghost of his long-dead wife, Virginia (Sophie Bortolussi).
 
Much of the musical’s magnetism is due to Sheehy’s excellent portrayal of Poe. Sheehy takes a man too often reduced to a caricature of the “tortured artist” and renders him as a three-dimensional, relatable character. Throughout the work, Poe composes intimate letters to his mother-in-law (who was also his aunt); Sheehy dictates the letters with intense, palpable emotion; he skilfully reaches past his character’s tendency to go off on philosophical and metaphysical tangents and brings to the forefront the anxieties and instabilities that led him to his strange and untimely death.
 
Despite the strength of Sheehy’s performance, Bortolussi (who also choreographed the whole musical) steals the show with her portrayal of Virginia. Her performance is mesmerizing, complex, and wonderfully expressive, all without saying a single word. She haunts Poe throughout the story, seeming alternately tender and cruel, loving and vengeful.
 
In one memorable scene, Bortolussi emerges like a corpse from the ground at Poe’s feet, seeking to draw him down with her into the earth; in another, she hovers above him as he enters a train compartment and then slips down to stay with him while he sleeps. The incredible physicality of Bortolussi’s performance – jumping, falling, climbing, and being thrown–heightens the emotional impact of the drama playing out on stage. She is impressively ominous at times, with halting, angular, almost zombie-like movements. As Poe becomes weaker, Virginia gains in strength. Her ghost becomes more audacious and real until Poe, and surely the audience, can think of nothing else.
Having one of the actors in a three-person musical be absolutely silent is only a part of the avant-garde unconventionality that characterizes the show. The set design, created by director Thaddeus Phillips, is decidedly minimalist; a single chair, two beat-up pianos, a patch of grass, and a few doors (variously used as desks, ceilings, trapdoors, and even a chicken coop) are the only props. Phillips’ creativity and ingenuity shine in his blocking of the actors and how they interact with the scenery. As the curtain rises, the scenery is arranged in order to give the perspective of someone looking down on Poe. His desk is flipped on its side, and Sheehy is draped over it so he appears to be below the audience: this creates the sensation of being a fly on the wall. This barrier between the actors and the audience is then slowly eroded throughout the production.
Jeremy Wilhelm plays Ranger Steve, the production’s only singing character, and he manages the score admirably with a clear, strong tenor. The writers used Poe’s work as much as possible, and many of the songs are simply Poe’s poetry set to music. In one of the show’s most striking scenes, Steve performs a Spanish translation of “El Dorado” to simple guitar accompaniment as Poe confronts Virginia’s ghost. They set off together on a passionate pas de deux, and Virginia’s presence grows until it dominates the stage (quite literally, as she wears two-foot stilts throughout the dance).
 
The passion and the wildness of the relationship between Poe and Virginia grow in tandem with Poe’s madness until he can bear it no more. In the climactic final scene, Virginia’s ghost keeps watch as a dying Poe recites these lines from his last work, “Eureka”: “I have spoken of memories that haunt us during our youth. They sometimes pursue us even in our manhood–assume gradually less and less indefinite shapes.” In this moment, the lines are given new significance. This is the great achievement of “Red Eye to Havre de Grace”: it is written about a poet, but in the end it reveals a man.

What do Harvard students and professional athletes have in common? 
In their late 20s and early 30s, nobody is riding a cloud of adoration, pride, and importance as much as a superstar athlete. The cheers of 10,000 fans and the hopes of a city resting on his left arm are simply intoxicating. He is successful and he is loved. Then just as quickly, it is gone. The city has moved on to a new hero. His identity evaporates and the word “star” is preceded by “former.” He finds himself an antiquated nobody at the old age of 35. “Athletes die twice,” sports writer John Feinstein once said. 
What Harvard students and professional athletes have in common is the burden of the early peak. Learning at one of the most prestigious universities in the world has a certain thrill. But Harvard students do not have nearly as glamorous a high point nor are they doomed to a mid-30s retirement like athletes. Indeed, we have the opportunity to make sure that Harvard is not the pinnacle of our lives. But this is precisely what makes an early peak like Harvard so dangerous for our psyche. 
Todd May, professor of philosophy at Clemson University, wrote a piece in the New York Times about the burden of an early peak in life, using Edward Snowden and professional football players as his examples. He says, “For many people—not just activists like Snowden or professional athletes—life crests early. But it doesn’t end there. It goes on, burdened by a summit that can never be reached again, which one can gaze upon only by turning back.” While some may reach higher summits, “for many, however, those earlier moments will be a quiet haunting, a reminder of what has been and cannot be again.”
While there certainly is a fear that Harvard will not live up to our lofty expectations, the opposite fear is subtler but equally powerful—the fear that Harvard will live up to expectations too well. Harvard is the place where we feel we have reached the pinnacle of success for our age group. This is the place that cultivated Yo-Yo Ma ’76, Henry A. Kissinger ’50, and Bill Gates. The possibilities are breathlessly infinite. 
And yet this is the greatest anxiety: this fear that one day we will have to look back at Mt. Harvard from the rolling valleys of post-graduation. Harvard’s superstar status in the academic world is wonderful for us now, but it also means that we have even harder to press ourselves if we do not want this to be the climax of our lives. There is a pressing feeling that if that becomes the case, then somehow we are intellectual frauds, who did not deserve to be here in the first place. 
Our lives become a constant struggle to stay at this elevation, pursuing exclusive internships, lab publications, and Phi Beta Kappa so that we can indeed reach even greater levels of importance than the one we are granted here at Harvard. Afraid of the drop, the most ambitious of us spend our time ensuring that we can one day look down at Harvard from a loftier place.
There is a difference, however, between success and contentment. The problem with an early peak is that it often forces you to choose between these two. Continue feeding your ambition and the amount of success you achieve will never be enough. If you adopt the determination not to let Harvard be your personal high point, you may find higher peaks, but ambition will prevent you from ever accepting each one as your best. If you hate the idea of peaking at 22, then you will hate peaking at 32 and 45 as well. You will struggle to maintain a constant upward trajectory, one that cannot exist. 
I admire most the people who can enjoy the view from a place like Harvard and then accept the inevitable drop in prestige afterward, the people who eschew the corporate ladder for a position as an English teacher at the local high school, if that is indeed what makes them happy. For the ambitious, it is hard to do. Even when I point out to my mother that teachers from my high school hold degrees and Ph.D.’s from places like Stanford and the University of Chicago, she brushes them off, saying, “They probably could not get a job anywhere else.”
The fear of someone saying this about me some day holds tremendous power. I hope that one day I will be able to accept that Harvard may be the crown of my life’s material success but that greater happiness and well-being may be yet to come. But for now, I have not outgrown my insecurities. I am more controlled than I would like to be by the praises of friends and teachers ringing in my bones from another age. 
Ambition is not necessarily a bad thing. But when our ambitions become more about the height of the peaks rather the journey upward, will we have the strength not to attempt another ascent?

We all know Harvard. At least, we think we do.
 
Even someone who never sets foot in the Yard knows the place. It’s where presidents come from, where the smartest students study, where leading academics toil away in labs. These are the dominant narratives here. No matter if we’re praising Harvard or pillorying it, they are the stories we have at our immediate disposal. The thing about dominant narratives, however, is that by nature they make little room for nuance—for nuance complicates things.
 
I want to talk about Black History Month.
 
In 1926, Carter G. Woodson—a Harvard graduate—founded Negro History Week, the precursor to Black History Month. An educator, Woodson envisioned Negro History Week as a means to reeducate whites, as well as blacks, on what it means to be a black American. In the Journal of Negro History, Woodson writes that racism is “the logical result of tradition, the inevitable outcome of thorough instruction to the effect that the Negro has never contributed anything to the progress of mankind.”
 
For Woodson, not only were blacks marginal in the telling of our American story, but they were also mischaracterized. If blacks were to be treated as equals, Woodson maintained, the incomplete narrative of slavery and family dysfunction had to be nuanced. With a certain idealism that befit a man who was both the son of slaves and a graduate of Harvard, Woodson believed that telling of the accomplishments of individual blacks during Negro History Week would change America’s dominant narrative about blacks as a group. Yet, a century and a black president later, the dominant cultural tropes—thug, welfare queen, baby mama—subsist despite the veritable parade of remarkable individuals contradicting them. A simple accounting of extraordinary individuals has, perhaps, proven insufficient.
 
The dominant narrative about Harvard—the one about professors and presidents and bright students—suffers from a similar problem to the one Woodson tried to rectify. It has no color to it. It is not a white narrative, per se, nor a narrative that intentionally excludes women or people of color. But what is the norm, what is average, what is expected, tends to be white and male. Study after study reveals the preferences our culture gives to white men. To tell a colorblind story, then, is often to tell a white story.
 
When I tell the story of my time at Harvard as an undergraduate, I tell the story of the freshman step team, of my roommates, and of Kuumba performances. I tell the story of staying up late on weeknights watching re-runs of “A Different World” and unconsciously melding the show’s (historically black) Hillman College with my own (personally black) Harvard College. I tell the story of David L. Evans and S. Allen Counter, mentors to hundreds of students over the past three decades.
 
One story I have never told is the story of the morning of my commencement when processing to the Yard I was shouted at, above all the fanfare, by an old white alumnus watching from the crowd: “They let you graduate? Must be grade inflation!”
 
You’ve probably never heard my Harvard story.
 
We all want recognition, the social theorists tell us. When I was a sophomore at Harvard, I led a project to document other black Harvard stories. A few scholars and students had documented this history before, but these accounts were incomplete. My team spent our days in the Harvard Archives and on The Harvard Crimson website, poring over yearbooks and reading newspaper clips. We interviewed alumni, bus drivers, dining hall workers, and professors. Our project aggregated into a 60,000 word manuscript that has been sitting on my computer, untouched, since 2008.
 
This year, I happened upon the manuscript. Reading it, I relearned so many stories that disappear in the everyday of campus life: that Widener Library was designed by a black architect, that the first two black graduates of Radcliffe—Alberta V. Scott and Gertrude Baker—used their degrees to teach at black schools in the South, and that in February of 1952, a group of white students burned a cross in front of a dorm housing the only black students of the class of 1955. Taken as a whole, these stories offer a collective accounting of the integral role blacks have played in campus life. In a recent interview in Ebony Magazine, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., reminds us that blacks “are as American as any other element in American history.” These stories remind us that the same is true of blacks at Harvard.
 
James Baldwin once wrote that “it is the writer, not the statesman, who is our strongest arm.” As a student of sociology, I understand that narratives matter—they motivate social action and they help us make sense of our world. It is hard to make the case, empirically, that Black History Month has changed, or ever could change, the behavior of a bigot or the dominant way we tell stories about blacks. And yet we continue the tradition every year. Part of our commitment is simply inertia. But a good part of it has to do with that annual moment of recognition, however nuanced and however fleeting, when our voice is finally heard.

For about a decade, I’ve been an avid reader of the latest work on human population genetics. Following a rush of oddball (and sometimes downright irresponsible) amateurs and a few informed commentators, I’ve woven in a background in ancient history and comparative linguistics to compensate for my elementary-at-best knowledge of molecular genetics. Last year, I bucked the norms of my Arabic composition class on literature and politics, writing on the origins of the Semitic language family and the demographic nature of the Islamic conquests from a genetic perspective. Until quite recently, this was an exercise on the margins: in most cases, genetic researchers kept their speculation to the unfathomably distant past, and traditional historians steered clear altogether.
 It isn’t hard to understand why social scientists of various shades have resisted the tide: comfortable in their particular methodologies and backed by decades of scholarly inertia, many cannot stand the idea of men in lab coats breaking from their traditional bailiwick and seizing the reins of academic history. It is one thing to sympathize; yet another to justify. Human population genetic science has sampled broadly enough, refined its models enough, and proven coherent enough to contribute critically to our understanding of history all the while seizing the reins of prehistory—confirming some narratives, denying others, and introducing entirely new paradigms to boot.
 I am of course not speaking of the history of great men, Enlightenment ideas, or early modern revolutions. Biologists are perfectly content to leave these things to their traditional practitioners (though let us not forget that we are only sure about Thomas Jefferson’s slave descendants through DNA research) in the interpretive arts and sciences. The task at hand is big history—what historiographers and Francophones speak of as the longue durée—the pliable stuff of great interdisciplinary works à la Diamond.
  If Jared Diamond’s “Guns, Germs, and Steel” is the canonical work of interdisciplinary world history writ ecological, Australian archaeologist Peter Bellwood’s “First Migrants,” published in 2013, is the genre’s breakout in the biological. Following his subtitle, “Ancient Migration in Global Perspective,” Bellwood’s thesis is clear: most of human history is best understood as population history—measurable in potsherds, lexemes, and genes alike.
  It is in weaving these strands together that Bellwood hits his stride, even if this columnist disagrees with his shoddy location of proto-Afroasiatic in the Levant and his identification of the Kurgan cultures of the Eurasian steppe with the Turkic and Yeniseian language families.  Unlike other recent “big historians” attempting to engage with genetic research (see Peter Watson’s “The Great Divide”), Bellwood is squarely on the cutting edge—a matter that makes the difference between idle molecular speculation and effective genetic history.
 This is to say, Bellwood is on board with a radical new insight that has swept the world of human population genetics in the last three or four years: “pots, not peoples,” is dead. Massive turnovers in language and material culture in prehistory and ancient history—turning Europe agricultural and Africa Bantu—have been overwhelmingly biological and total in their sweep. The contemporary population genetic (read: racial-phenotypic) landscape of the Old World continents is shockingly new—to put it simply, when Khufu and Khafre were laid to rest in their famous pyramids 4,500 years ago, most of Africa didn’t look “African.” Just a few thousand years older, brown-skinned, blue-eyed hunter-gatherers roamed Spain, speaking a language nobody today could conceivably recognize.
 Bellwood, like the few historians who have engaged maturely with genetics, stops short on the margins of written history—an excusable matter considering the geographical and interdisciplinary scope of his work. But the success of “First Migrants” tenders a challenge to historians of later eras: no matter the home discipline of the author, genetics is now one of the bases he must cover—and in more than unsophisticated passing. Recent whole-genome findings have richly leavened our understanding of the last half millennium of New World population history. No contemporary “big historian” of colonial Latin America, the slave South, or French Canada should be forgiven for omitting the insights of population genetics, whether confirmatory or challenging. 
 Most importantly, the genetic revolution in history ought to serve as a great cathartic, purging the academy and popular imagination of seductive hobgoblins, served up as arguable history. Shlomo Sand’s “The Invention of the Jewish People,” a 2009 work of ideological postmodernism that embraces tired circumstantial arguments for the origins of European Jews among the Turko-Mongolian Khazars of the steppe, is a case in point. Sand, an intellectual historian of French cinema, is clearly out of his depth when discussing the origins of a people—a measurable enterprise thanks to the tools of population genetics. He thus relies on straw men and well-worded sophistry to obfuscate the genetically undeniable: that by and large, Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of Judean men from the Middle East and their Western European convert wives.
 This is not, I should caution, a rebuke of the Kuhnian skepticism that got historians of science so skeptical of their own subject in the first place. Population genetic historians work in a world of constructs—and no degree of molecular precision will ever amount to pure truth. When used properly, it’s certainly a step up, however, from interpretive methods alone.

In a letter to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ‘86, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland wrote that “111 schools,” Harvard included, “may be contravening the requirements of the Higher Education Act” through misleading financial aid application instructions. According to the Higher Education Act passed in 1992, colleges can only require the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for students wishing to apply for federal aid. However, until recently, Harvard's financial aid application instructions, boxed together both the FAFSA as well as the CSS PROFILE application—a College Board managed form that cannot be used for the purposes of determining federal aid—with the phrase “all applicants” affixed to both.
 
Harvard's old formulation, which Congressman Cummings says insufficiently clarifies "what each form is used to assess" and exists "without any explanation of use or purpose,” is specifically cited in the letter.
 
The old instructions appear to be a well-intentioned attempt to encourage students to apply for Harvard’s generous financial aid. Students must complete the CSS PROFILE to receive Harvard aid, and applicants who fill out only the FAFSA might never know about the financial assistance that Harvard could give them. The difference between the two applications is yet another example of the extreme complexity of the financial aid process. Harvard should make it as easy as possible for students to apply for financial aid, but that goal should not interfere with delivering complete and accurate information to applicants. The simple wording change makes it clear that only the FAFSA is required for federal aid, but filling out the CSS PROFILE is in almost every financial aid applicant’s interest.
 
The complications of the financial aid applications are among the many hurdles that disproportionally affect those undecided about whether or not they will apply to specific colleges. The cost of the CSS PROFILE, especially for families that narrowly exceed the income limit for the fee waiver program, is troubling because it presents a barrier to those applying for Harvard aid.
 
The FAFSA, as its name indicates, is a free application. In 1992 when the Higher Education Act was amended, the FAFSA was redesigned to consolidate the several forms that had previously existed for application for federal aid. Some of these now-obsolete forms had fee requirements, and the streamlining of the FAFSA was done in significant part because these fee requirements deterred potential college applicants.
 
Harvard's financial aid application must recognize the history of the FAFSA and the reasoning behind its creation. It is certainly much simpler for a Harvard administrator to simplify our financial aid application and make it free than it is for a 17-year-old from a low-income household to decide whether or not she should apply. Regardless of how open and considerate the college currently is about financial aid, there is clearly room for improvement.
 Harvard has nothing to lose, and a few simple fixes that build on the wording change that has already been made could change a young student's life.

Last Wednesday, members of Harvard Law School’s Immigration Project announced a legal opinion supporting the Trust Act—a piece of legislation that prevents U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement from ordering local and state law enforcement to apply federal immigration policy.
The opinion drafted by the Harvard Immigration Project was signed by 33 legal scholars, including 13 Harvard Law School professors and at least one expert from each of Massachusetts’s other law schools, according to the Massachusetts Trust Act Coalition’s press release.
The Trust Act currently sits in committee at the Massachusetts State House.
“It's perfectly legal for police to focus on fighting crime instead of taking on the financial and other responsibilities of federal immigration policies,”  Law School professor Deborah E. Anker said in the release. “Doing otherwise would undermine community policing and prevent local law enforcement authorities from setting their own priorities."
The current practice can prevent those in immigrant families from reporting crimes and taking advantage of police resources out of fear of being deported, according to Eva L. Bitran, a third year at the Law School and the president of the Harvard Immigration Project.
“[It] really erodes immigrant communities’ trust in community policing,” she said.
After the announcement, Law School students and other advocates went to the State House and delivered the opinion to the chairmen of the Joint Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security and the Judiciary Committee, where the Act is currently under consideration.
“That’s the big push—to get it voted out of committee,” said Lillian S. Axelrod, a second year at the Law School who helped kickstart the project this summer while she worked at the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic, which Anker directs.
“This type of advocacy tool has been used in the past….I think the legislature takes what the legal scholars in the state say rather seriously,” said Philip L. Torrey, who serves as the supervising attorney for the Harvard Immigration Project in addition to serving as a lecturer on law at the Harvard Immigration Clinic.
The Act must be voted out of committee by the end of March to be considered and voted on by the state legislature.
“We feel really good about its chances of coming out of committee,” Bitran said. “We have some strong allies in the state Senate and the House.”
Previously, the Harvard Immigration Project primarily focused on legal services, such as assisting immigrants in obtaining green cards and being released from immigration detention on bond.
As co-president, Bitran added a policy advocacy committee, which she currently chairs, to the Project.
“We really wanted to get involved in Massachusetts community projects,” Bitran said. “We are better able to leverage our privilege and make our voices heard in our own community.”
The group hopes to keep activism a part of its mission.
“Hopefully we will continue to do more community policy advocacy work,” Torrey said. “It does have a pretty strong influence.”

Samuel Moyn, who currently serves as the James Bryce Professor of European Legal History at Columbia University, will join the Harvard Law School faculty in July as a professor of law.
“I’ve spent my life in history departments, and I’m looking forward to very different stimulation in moving to this intellectual community,” Moyn said.
 
After graduating from the Law School in 2001, Moyn joined the Columbia faculty as an assistant professor and was named professor of history in 2007.
“Sam Moyn’s deep learning is rivaled only by his originality,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release. “His work on the history of human rights gives experts as well as students so much food for thought. 
Last spring, Moyn taught a course at the Law School entitled “Human Rights: History and Theory.”
With an academic background in history—Minow referred to Moyn as “an expert in European intellectual history” in the Law School’s press release—Moyn hopes to interact with Harvard’s History Department. 
“I hope to have very close relations to the History Department as well,” Moyn said, citing his professional relationships with members of Harvard’s History Department.
Moyn’s book, “The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History,” was published in 2010, and his collection of essays, “Human Rights and the Uses of History,” will be released this spring.
Moyn also serves as the editor of Humanity, a peer-reviewed journal that publishes research on humanitarian and human rights issues in the contemporary world.
Moyn completed his undergraduate studies at Washington University in St. Louis in 1994 and earned a Ph.D. in European History from the University of California, Berkeley in 2000 before attending the Law School.
At Columbia, Moyn received numerous awards for his teaching. In 2007, Columbia College students awarded him the Mark Van Doren award for outstanding undergraduate teaching. In the same year, Moyn received the Distinguished Columbia Faculty Award for “unusual merit across a range of professional activities.”
Moyn also received the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2008, which seeks to “provide fellows with blocks of time in which they can work with as much creative freedom as possible,” according to the Foundation.
“We are delighted to welcome him back to his alma mater and I look forward to being his colleague,” Minow said.

Over half of Harvard undergraduates awoke last Friday on Valentine's Day morning to find a personalized list of students with which a Harvard Computer Society algorithm determined they are most compatible.
A total of 3,672 students, 2,074 women and 1,598 men, participated this year year's Datamatch, which 20 years after its founding still uses the same algorithm.
“The pairing is actually pretty complicated,” HCS President William S. Xiao ’16 said.
 
HCS meets the night before Datamatch results come out to sort all of the questions from the survey into ten personality trait-based categories. Every answer is then plotted based on the traits it tests for. 
Questions are then weighted based on the intuition of HCS members, distribution of answers, and the correlation between the answers of survey participants who indicated that they were in a relationship with another participant.
“A lot of people ask if it’s random, and it’s not random,” said Xiao, who added that there is “some secret sauce in it that I can’t reveal.”
Questions for the survey are generated less scientifically. “With the questions we just think about anything that will be funny, and we think about the implications of the questions later,” Xiao said.
 
Questions commonly contain Harvard cultural references, some of which Xiao said are generated from The Crimson’s Ten Stories That Shaped 2013. There are also generic questions, like “what would you like to see in a Valentine,” which also have comical answers.
Datamatch appealed most to freshmen this year, with 1,007 taking the survey. By contrast, 903 sophomores, 741 juniors, and 750 seniors participated.
One freshman, Maggie H. Schell ’17, who completed Datamatch with friends, said, “It was funny. We did it as a joke to see who we would get.”
 
Schell had not yet contacted or been contacted by any of her matches. 
Xiao revealed that other colleges have reached out to HCS to duplicate Datamatch.
 
“There have been people who have asked us to run it at other schools, which we are happy to do,” he said, “as long as they come up with the questions.”
 
Xiao also said that he would like to expand to other countries, specifically China, increase the number of serious questions, and fund Datamatch dates, much like the UC recently did.
 
HCS, a student-run organization, is responsible for running all of the Harvard mailing lists and hosts websites for student groups at Harvard.
 
Xiao said that HCS does not collect data on how many people actually reach out to their matches, but would appreciate hearing from people who have contacted their matches.

Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid recently made changes to its aid instructions a week after being listed among 110 colleges that may have been misleading financial aid applicants, according to the Democratic staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.
The Committee’s investigation indicated that Harvard’s financial aid instructions informed applicants to fill out the FAFSA and CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE “without any explanation of use or purpose.”
In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86,  Maryland Congressman Elijah E. Cummings—the ranking Democrat on the committee—wrote that students may be paying to send the PROFILE form to colleges when they only wish to apply for federal financial aid. In such circumstances, students would only need to fill out the free FAFSA and not the PROFILE. Leading students to believe otherwise, Cummings added, could be in violation of the Higher Education Act.
Recent changes to the instructions on Harvard’s financial aid site, though, now indicate the specific purpose for the CSS and FAFSA forms.
Bolded headers in the PDF instructions on the site now explain that the FAFSA “determines eligibility for federal aid” and the PROFILE  “determines eligibility for Harvard aid.”
Several other universities, such as Yale and the University of Pennsylvania, have also decided to change their financial aid instructions in the wake of Cumming’s investigation and letter to Duncan.
In an email, Cummings wrote that he was glad to see schools taking action.
“I have been very pleased with the quick responses of many schools that are correcting their instructions on their own without waiting for formal action by the [Education] Department,” Cummings wrote.
He added that he thinks that, since he released his letter, Harvard has made its aid instructions more precise.
“It appears that Harvard has made changes to its website to more clearly communicate the uses of the financial aid forms its requests of applicants,” Cummings wrote.
As more institutions make efforts to ensure their financial aid instructions are clear, Cummings said that he plans to be in contact with schools to follow up on the changes they are making.
“We will be monitoring the actions of all institutions identified in my letter, and we intend to follow-up directly with many of these schools and the Department of Education to determine next steps,” Cummings wrote.
When asked about the changes made to Harvard's financial aid instructions, Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal emphasized that the University is striving to make sure all aid information is accurate and clear.
“We continuously review the information we provide to applicants and students—both online and in many daily interactions with financial aid officers—and will continue working to ensure that our students have the clear guidance they need to access the federal and Harvard-funded aid to which they are entitled,” Neal wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Defense Intelligence Agency director Michael T. Flynn reflected on the role of the DIA in U.S. security at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday evening.
Flynn, who has served as the director since 2012, said that urbanization and population growth have altered the scale and scope of the nation’s security challenges in recent decades.
 
“There are going to be large numbers of people in locations where there is not the strength of institutions that we take for granted in this country,” said Flynn, estimating that close to 10 billion people will populate the world within the next few decades.
 
David E. Sanger ’82, a senior writer for the New York Times and former Crimson editor, moderated the forum, asking Flynn questions about former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.
 
Flynn expounded upon the leaks from the past year, emphasizing the institution’s focus on identifying and tagging individuals behind intelligence breaches.
 
“I thought it was really fascinating because a lot of people think cyberattacks are these kind of computer-manifested problems,” said Avika Dua ’17. “It’s more about understanding actual humans’ intentions and capabilities, rather than the computer.”
 
Flynn also commented on the post-Arab Spring era in the Middle East and its effect on the already tense discourse with the U.S. He doubted a forthcoming U.S. resolution, noting that civil and regional conflict is something that will continue into the future.
 
“The real challenge these days, and that is of concern for the international community, is the foreign element inside the extremist groups in Syria,” Flynn said.
 
Beyond the discussion of current events, Flynn said he hoped the forum would educate the younger generation about the institution’s evolving role in the context of modern-day security challenges.
 
“I hope [the audience] gain[ed] an appreciation for the demands our nation is facing in this 21st-century world,” he said. 
Carolyn R. Ye ’17 agreed, noting that Flynn’s analysis of Snowden’s leaks and the DIA’s response toward the leaks has clarified her understanding of U.S. intelligence groups.
 
“There’s this whole mystique about the intelligence agencies,” Ye said.  “[The forum] cleared up a lot of misconceptions about the DIA.”
 
Flynn ended the evening by acknowledging the difficulties of the past, yet looking forward.
 
“When you look at where we are today in the scale and the scope of some of the security challenges we face,” Flynn said. “That is the here and now. We need to think about the future, your future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the addition of two new creative writing instructors this academic year, the English Department is looking to continue the program’s expansion, hopefully with the help of Harvard’s ongoing capital campaign, the department’s interim chair said last week.
 
The desire to expand the program comes as creative writing courses—from screenwriting to creative non-fiction—have seen a dramatic increase in popularity over the past few years.
 
Interim English Department Chair Nicholas J. Watson said that in recent years, the department has received twice the number of applications than they have seats to fill for any given semester. 
“The number of lecturers teaching has somewhat increased, but we haven’t reached a number close to capacity,” Watson said. “Over the last five to 10 years we have had about a 30 percent increase in applicants."
 
He attributed the excess in applications to small class sizes and a relatively small teaching staff for the size of the demand. While each course has a maximum enrollment of 14 students, the program only currently employs nine instructors, the majority of whom are non-tenure track lecturers within the English Department.
 
In addition to the two recent hires, as well as the return of African and African American Studies professor and creative writing instructor Jamaica Kincaid, Watson said that the department has requested permission from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to hire another creative non-fiction instructor this year.
 
“From our point of view, I am hoping that the capital campaign might result in some extra resources for our program,” he said. “We certainly indicated having a larger number of people. We put these requests into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. I think that the general understanding is that this is something that needs to be grown.”
 
English professor Jorie Graham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet who teaches creative writing, made a similar argument before administrators and faculty members at FAS’s monthly meeting in October. 
The English Department is not the only body that wishes to see the program grow. Undergraduates have long expressed frustration over the difficulty in getting into creative writing courses and lobbied for additional offerings. And, according to Watson, the University backs an expansion of the program.
“The University is very interested in having people trained to think of themselves as writing for a general audience, a general public of some sort,” he said. “I think creative non-fiction is an extremely good route to learning how to do that and I think that is certainly what the Faculty of Arts and Sciences is interested in in relation to it.”
 
Though much of the program’s growth is being driven by creative non-fiction, which Watson said draws non-concentrators, program instructor Sam Marks attributes the increased popularity of all of the courses to student’s desire to create.
 
“I think students today are as interested in creating things as much as they are analyzing them,” said Marks, one of the most recent department hires.
Another of those new instructors, Mark J. Poirier echoed the sentiment. He said he believes that many students have not had the time to be creative before arriving at Harvard and that the program offers a chance to do so.
 
“Part of the issue with creative writing is that that to get into Harvard, you have to take all of these AP classes and all of that, and you don’t have much time in high school to be creative,” he said. “I think that is why Harvard students are so attracted to these creative writing classes.”
 
Launched in October, the Campaign for Arts and Sciences—FAS’s portion of the capital campaign—will seek to raise $600 million for “Faculty and Our Scholarly Enterprise.” The University has not said how that money will be distributed.

Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, is in preliminary discussions with China-based Evergrande Real Estate Group, a major donor to the University, about a potential hospital project in China, a spokesperson for Brigham and Women’s said Tuesday night.
 
However the spokesperson, Erin McDonough, emphasized that no deal has been struck and that the hospital’s board is simply considering a proposal made by Evergrande. On Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported a statement apparently made by Evergrande which said the project was moving forward, but The Crimson was unable to verify the statement and could not reach Evergrande before press time.
 
“Brigham and Women's Hospital has a long-standing commitment to global health,” McDonough wrote in an email. “This component of our mission…has resulted in Evergrande's request to explore the possibility of collaborating to develop a similar hospital model in China. We are honored by Evergrande's request and are discussing it with our board.”
 
In November, Evergrande made a large gift to the University to fund three new research centers, including one focusing on immunology. The donation was accepted at an event in Cambridge in early December attended by University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Evergrande officials, and Elizabeth G. Nabel, president of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
 
Still, the donation does not appear to be tied to any University activity in China. Despite its status as a Harvard-affiliated hospital, Brigham and Women’s has its own board of trustees and usually acts independently of the University, a point emphasized by Gina Vild, a spokesperson for Harvard Medical School.
 
“Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals are independently governed,” Vild wrote in an emailed statement on Tuesday night. “As a result, we would not be involved in any discussions between Brigham and Women's Hospital and Evergrande.”

After the financial crisis stalled long-held design plans, real estate developer Carpenter & Company is set to break ground on a $65 million development project at 114 Mt. Auburn St. that will result in a multi-story office building to be fully leased to Harvard.
The groundbreaking, planned for Wednesday morning at 9:30 a.m., will kick off both the construction of the new building at the Mt. Auburn site, formerly the home of Chili’s, as well as the redevelopment of the adjacent historic Conductor’s Building. According to the Boston Business Journal, the main building in the 70,000-square-foot space will be 100-percent leased to Harvard on a long-term lease. The 5,000-square-foot Conductor’s Building, which was built in 1912, is a designated historical space that will be simultaneously renovated.
According to a University spokesperson, although Harvard is “in the planning process” of determining how the new building will be used, it anticipates that the building will fulfill “primarily normal office uses.”
The new building will feature seven floors of office space and the possibility for retail on the ground floor, according to David P. Manfredi, the architect responsible for the project's construction phase. Manfredi said that natural lighting will be a key feature of the potential retail space.
“There is a lot of transparency on the ground floor,” he said.
Manfredi added that the building will be made of cast stone, brick, and copper, and will be constructed over the nearby MBTA electric transformer, which will continue to operate out of sight.
“[The new building will fit] very much into the vernacular of Harvard Square,” Manfredi said. “What it really tries to do is take a historic material palette and reinterpret that in a new way.”
Carpenter & Company, which is led by its president Richard L. Friedman, also played a role in developing the Charles Street Jail into the Liberty Hotel and led the development of the Charles Square shopping area, according to its website.
 
Although the architects’ designs have been ready for years, construction was significantly set back by the recession, Manfredi said. Despite the setbacks, he said he looks forward to working with the developers, including Friedman, who he has known for several years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Feb. 19, 2014, at 11:30 p.m.
Hedge fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 has donated $150 million to Harvard and has directed at least $125 million of the gift to support financial aid at the College. The gift, announced by the University on Wednesday afternoon, is the largest single donation in the history of Harvard College.
The gift will fund 200 new scholarships named for Griffin and create a fund to match other donations in support of 600 additional scholarships. $10 million of the gift will fund a new professorship at Harvard Business School, and the remaining $15 million has not yet been directed.
"It sets a marvelous standard of generosity and also a standard for financial aid giving,” University President Drew G. Faust said. "[The gift] is structured in part as a challenge...in order to try to involve other people in contributing to financial aid, and I hope that it also sends a message to alums about how...important it is to make sure that Harvard is available to students from every kind of economic background."
With the gift, the Harvard College Office of Financial Aid will be renamed in Griffin’s honor, and the center’s executive director, Sarah C. Donahue, will now be referred to as the Griffin Director of Financial Aid, according to the release.
“My goal with this gift is to help ensure that Harvard’s need-blind admission policy continues, and that our nation’s best and brightest have continued access to this outstanding institution,” Griffin said in the press release.
Griffin began his investing ventures in his Cabot House dorm room as an undergraduate and established the Chicago-based Citadel hedge fund a year after graduating with a degree in economics in 1989.
In 1999, the year of his tenth reunion, Griffin endowed a scholarship in honor of his grandfather. He remained affiliated with Harvard, later serving on the Financial Aid Task Force. As of September 2013, Griffin had an estimated net worth of $4.4 billion, according to Forbes.
Last year, the College’s financial aid budget was $182 million, the largest ever and reflects a nearly 90 percent increase on spending on undergraduate financial aid since 2007. 
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 called the new infusion a dream come true.
“This is one of those things that you dream might happen and you hope [for], but you never expect it would take place,” he said, “but here we are.”
Last fall, the University launched a capital campaign that is seeking a higher-education record $6.5 billion. Financial aid is one of the University’s six priorities for the campaign, and Fitzsimmons said on Wednesday that he hopes to raise $600 million for aid purposes.
The timing of Griffin’s gift marks the ten-year anniversary of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, a program which began in 2004 by eliminating parental contributions to tuition for families making less than $40,000 annually, a benchmark that was eventually raised  to $65,000.
Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is a close friend of Griffin’s and was instrumental in securing the gift, according to Faust and Fitzsimmons.
“Mike Smith was critical in terms of making the case for financial aid, and I know he has a very, very good relationship with Ken,” Fitzsimmons said. “Oftentimes when people are making gifts of any kind they are also thinking of the relationships with the people who are part of that organization.”
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal said that Smith was traveling on Wednesday and could not be reached. But in a Wednesday’s press release, Smith praised Griffin.
“Ken’s astounding philanthropic leadership has set financial aid—one of the most important priorities of the College’s capital campaign—on a lasting foundation,”  Smith said in the release.
Griffin’s gift is among a recent surge of nine-figure donations. Johns Hopkins, Yale, and Cornell all received the largest gifts in their histories last year, a $350 million gift, $250 million gift, and a $133 million gift, respectively. Griffin’s $150 million donation to Harvard, which easily surpasses any individual gift in the College’s history, would not even rank in the top 25 private gifts to higher education, according to a Chronicle of Higher Education almanac.
The largest philanthropic gift to the University prior to that of Griffin came from Hansjörg Wyss, who received his M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1965 and has given two $125 million gifts in recent years. Before Wyss, the largest donation came from David Rockefeller ’36, the grandson of the famous oil magnate, who donated $100 million to the University in 2008 to support international programs and the expansion of arts education. That amount matched a $100 million gift from Eli and Edythe Broad in 2005 donated for genetic research.

The Undergraduate Council's Education Committee is rallying behind an internal initiative to ease the burden on students paying for course materials by decreasing costs and eventually increasing the amount of free course material available on course websites.
The initiative was born out of UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard’s ’15 campaign last November, according to UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy, and, if passed, would have three parts.
The first of those parts would require instructors to list the expense of course materials on their syllabi. The committee will also design a system to indicate which courses have made efforts to decrease the cost of course materials so that students can factor this information into their decisions about classes. Finally, the initiative has the long-term goal of encouraging professors to upload free course materials online.
The initiative is intended to create a “more equal Harvard, where students can pursue the opportunities they would like,” Kanuparthy said.
 
According to Sally C. Donahue, director of financial aid, the Financial Aid Office currently estimates that on average, students spend $1340 per year on their textbooks and course material. This number, obtained from an annual FAO course materials survey, reflects the full-price of books at the Coop.
“The cost of course materials isn’t one of the immediate costs of Harvard that you think about,” Kanuparthy said. “But in the context of a student’s day-to-day life, it can play a big role.”
The initiative must first be proposed by a member of faculty and brought before the Faculty Council twice for it to be instituted in the FAS Handbook. Only when the initiative is later presented to the full Faculty, may a vote be taken.
 
Additionally, the committee hopes to partner with the Financial Aid Office, which releases a survey each year to determine the cost of books and other course materials. According to Donahue, the FAO will share their survey data with the Undergraduate Education Committee on Thursday to aid with their initiative.
Many students said that they agree the cost of course materials can present challenges to students. Bryan N. Poellot '17 said that last semester, he and his friend bought and resold math textbooks for less than their initial value in order to pay for their own textbooks, including one which cost $130.
“For a lot of courses, you can go on Amazon and find your book cheap,” Poellot said. “But then there are some courses that don’t have this option and they don't have other ways to access materials, because they have course packs.”
In addition to pushing for the implementation of their course materials initiative, the committee hopes to follow though with other projects proposed last semester. These include the implementation of a mid-semester grade report, a new pass/fail deadline, and a mid-semester faculty evaluation.

The University of Tokyo joined edX on Tuesday, becoming the 32nd institution to partner with the online education platform, which was created by Harvard and MIT in May 2012.
 
The University of Tokyo was founded in 1877 as the first national university in Japan and now has a total of about 28,000 students according to its website. It is considered to be one of the best institutions of higher learning  in Asia.
 
The first two courses to be offered on UTokyoX will be “Visualizing Postwar Tokyo: Parts 1 and 2.” The courses will both be taught by Shunya Yoshimi, a vice president of the University of Tokyo and a professor of sociology, cultural studies, and media studies.
 
“I am extremely pleased to be able to present the courses to the people around the world that will deepen their understanding of Japan,” Yoshimi said in a press release. “With the implementation of flipped classroom that actively uses these courses, I believe that we will contribute to the bolstering of education at UTokyo that will foster global-minded human resources."
 
The two courses, slated to launch later this year, cover the history, development, and geopolitics of postwar Tokyo from the perspective of cultural media including film, photography, and television.
 
“We are committed to offering courses from institutions as diverse as the nearly two million students on our platform,” Anant Agarwal, the president of edX, said in the press release. “As one of the leading research universities in the world, The University of Tokyo will help us achieve that goal."
 
Registration for the UTokyoX courses is currently open.
 
The University of Tokyo joins the University of Kyoto as the only Japanese institutions on the platform. The consortium, consisting of 32 institutions of higher learning, has expanded globally in the last year. To date, the consortium counts 18 partnerships outside of the U.S..

After notching its first wins of the season in Minnesota a week ago, the Harvard men’s tennis team (4-3) ran its dual match streak to four before falling in the finals of the ECAC Division I Tennis Championship to Columbia (8-1). The top-seeded Crimson dropped just one match en route to the championship round but was swept by the second-seeded Lions.
“That was the best tennis we have ever seen [Columbia] play, so it was a bit surprising,” junior co-captain Alex Steinroeder said. “Overall, it was a good weekend. We would have liked to beat Columbia, but there are some takeaways, and we know we will be better when we play them in Ivies.”
COLUMBIA 4, HARVARD 0
In the championship, the Crimson saw its doubles dominance come to an end. After winning all four doubles sets to that point, Harvard dropped the bottom two doubles lines. Sophomore Nicky Hu and freshman Brian Yeung fell, 6-3. Not soon after, freshman Sebastian Beltrame and junior Christo Schultz, who had not yet played together in the tournament, lost the clincher, 6-4.
“[Columbia has] played well this year, and we knew we’d be in for a battle,” junior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “They definitely had a lot of experience on their team and it showed throughout the weekend.”
In singles play, Harvard was not able to take a set from Columbia. The No. 40 Lions displayed their depth, winning lines three, five, and six in quick succession. Yeung, who had not lost a tournament match to that point, notched only two games in a 6-1, 6-1 defeat. At the sixth line, Hu fell as well, 6-3, 6-2. Down 3-0,
Harvard quickly went up a set on courts one and four, with Beltrame and Nguyen taking 6-4 openers. On court two, Chaudhuri rebounded after dropping a 6-3 opener to take the second set, 6-1. But after giving up the first set, 6-1, freshman Andrew Ball was unable to extend the match, losing a close second set, 6-4.
After the loss, Chaudhuri noted that the Crimson was up in the three matches that were stopped after Ball was defeated. According to the junior, the final tally was not reflective of how close the dual match was.
“We were pretty close on courts two and three, so doubles could have gone either way,” Chaudhuri said. “In singles, we had a couple advantages in the remaining matches. I think that the match was closer than the 4-0 score [indicates].”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 0
In the semifinals, the Crimson made short work of the Big Red (5-4). Harvard took the doubles point with wins in the top two positions. Hu and Yeung got an early break and served out a quick match, 6-3, while Nguyen and MacMaster closed out their opponents by the same score to clinch the doubles point.
In singles, Nguyen dropped only four games in a sound defeat over Cornell’s No. 1 seed, Stefan Vinti. Next, a pair of freshmen—Beltrame and Ball—came through to clinch the match. Both rookies ran away with their first sets, 6-2, before needing second-set tiebreakers to put away their opponents. It was the second consecutive match  in which Beltrame and Ball had come through with the clinching victories for Harvard.
“I think all three of the freshmen have really helped the team out a lot,” Chaudhuri said. “I think we have a great season ahead of us and have a really good opportunity to play well. They are going to be a big part of that.”
HARVARD 4, PENN 1
Entering the tournament as the top seed, Harvard kicked off its campaign with a matchup against the Quakers (1-3). The Crimson swiftly took care of its opponents in double play, dropping only three games in two matches to earn the point. Yeung and Beltrame staked Harvard out to an early lead with a 6-2 victory at the second line, while MacMaster and Nguyen dropped only one game en route to taking the clincher.
In singles, three freshmen came through in straight sets to give the Crimson the win. After Steinroeder fell in two sets, 6-1, 6-4, Yeung, Beltrame, and Ball took consecutive victories to catapult Harvard to the next round. Yeung gave up just three games at number two, while Beltrame broke opponent Jeremy Court early and often, recording a 6-1, 6-3 win.

Though the score wasn’t close on paper, it was the closest game of the day that sealed the Harvard men’s squash team’s 31st national championship. The victory also broke Trinity’s 14-season CSA title streak. In a tense five-set duel in the second flight that pitted Trinity’s Karan Malik against co-captain Brandon McLaughlin, the Crimson senior stormed back from a 2-1 set deficit to claim the Potter Cup for his teammates.
“Brandon had a really tight match,” said freshman Dylan Murray, who won his game in the No. 3 spot in straight sets. “[H]e had to battle back. He had to fight off two match balls in order to win his match, and [as] a senior captain on the team it was huge for him to…be able to clinch the national championship for the first time in his four years.”
McLaughlin began his day out of the No. 2 position with a tight 13-11 first-set win before running into some trouble against Malik. After dropping the next two sets, 11-8, 11-8, the co-captain kept his focus and took the fourth set, 11-2, to extend the game. McLaughlin and the junior Bantam matched each other shot-for-shot, with the Crimson senior eventually taking an 11-10 lead to force a match ball, this time in his favor.
“He was in command at times in the match, and then he would go back into a [bad] habit,” Harvard coach Mike Way said. “What was exciting as a coach was to see that happen but then to see [McLaughlin] catch himself…admonishing himself at certain points, collecting himself, and really getting back to the plan that was going to work.”
With spectators pressing against all sides of the court, the Crimson co-captain received the ball off the left wall and hit a soft backhanded shot into the front right corner, out of Malik’s reach. With the set, game, match, and championship ensured for Harvard, McLaughlin dropped his racket and shook his clenched fists in triumph, yelling with the crowd.
“He definitely deserved it,” Murray said. “He worked so hard during the season along with the rest of the team…. I think it’s a great culmination of his four years at Harvard. It’s a great way for him to finish things out.”
The contest was McLaughlin’s final team match for the Crimson (18-0, 7-0 Ivy), and finishing on top made the win even sweeter, according to Way.
“What a fitting finish, to be the fifth match and the clincher,” Way said. “I don’t think this is a moment he’s going to ever forget.”
McLaughlin also guaranteed that the No. 1 Crimson would avenge its 6-3 defeat at the hands of the Bantams in last year’s Potter Cup final.
“My number one feeling was that I was delighted for [McLaughlin],” Way said. “It’s a relief, though it sounds like a funny word…. [Up 4-0], I felt comfortable [that] we were going to win the team event, but in that moment, that was really…the clincher for Brandon McLaughlin.”
Playing from the No. 2 position for most of the season, McLaughlin posted a 10-2 record in his senior campaign. Over the three-day CSA Team Championships, McLaughlin recorded three wins out of the second slot.
“[McLaughlin] is an instinctive player, and what I mean by that is he doesn’t need a lot of instructions tactically,” Way said. “He’s learned to become a better player, [with] a more professional style of play, and he’s learned to do that over the past three seasons.”
In the quarterfinals against Ivy opponent Penn, McLaughlin and fellow captain Gary Power led the way with straight set victories. McLaughlin earned a 11-3, 11-3, 11-4 decision. The next afternoon, the Winthrop House resident handled his Franklin and Marshall opponent in straight sets, 11-8, 11-8, 11-3.
“We look up to Gary and Brandon, both of our captains, a ton,” Murray said. “They help us with not only our squash [play] but everything on and off court, whether it’s academics or anything else in life.”
The five-set win was also a major milestone for McLaughlin. It was his first win in three tries from the No. 2 position against a Trinity opponent in the chase for the Potter Cup.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though it may have been an impossible task to beat men’s squash captain Brandon McLaughlin’s national title winning effort for this edition of the Crimson sports board’s Athlete of the Week, the runners-up did not disappoint with their respective weekend showings.
 
Jasmine Evans, Women’s Basketball
The Harvard women’s basketball team easily defeated the two Ivy League opponents that trotted into the Lavietes Pavillion this weekend, and Evans had a hand in both wins.
Coming off the bench against Cornell Saturday evening, the 5’9” guard led the Crimson with 21 points in 27 minutes and shot 7-of-11 from the field in the 84-69 win. She didn’t stop there, recording five rebounds—three of which were on the offensive end—two assists and three steals.
Though the Menlo Park, CA native only saw 17 minutes of action off the bench the previous day in a 99-64 rout of Columbia, Evans still led the team in assists with five and was tied for second in boards with five. While she is averaging 8.5 points per game on 39.6 percent shooting for the season, Evans has shot 57.1 percent from the field and scored 11.5 points per game in her past four tilts.
Steve Moundou-Missi, Men’s Basketball
 
It took two overtime periods to do it, but the men’s basketball team shook a pesky Lions squad, 88-84, on Friday night in New York. Not to be outdone by point guard Siyani Chambers’ 22 points, Moundou-Missi poured in 22 of his own in 38 minutes of play to go along with eight rebounds and two steals.
An 80 percent free throw shooter on the season, the 6’7” big man was on point against Columbia as well, sinking 8-of-10 from the charity stripe.
Though Moundou-Missi may not have been needed for the whole game in the Crimson’s 67-44 rout of the Big Red the next day, he was a perfect 4-of-4 from the field in the 23 minutes he was out on the court. Again, the sophomore from Yaounde, Cameroon recorded a pair of steals and was 2-of-3 from the line. With the two solid performances, Moundou-Missi now sports a 54.5 field goal percentage along and 5.4 rebounds per contest against Ivy League opponents.

For those of you who may not yet have taken the time to step back from the world of frenzied psetting, essay-writing, and blocking drama, it’s Olympic season! The Winter Games in Sochi are well underway, and the United States is (as usual) way up there in medal count. 
If you’ve been too caught up in the Harvard bubble this past week, never fear: here's a run-down of a few of the most notable U.S. triumphs in Sochi. Hopefully these will be a source of inspiration—if these athletes can succeed against all odds, then you should be able to get that 10-page paper in by midnight tonight, right?

1.    Sage Kotsenberg wins the first gold medal of the Olympics.
 
Right before Park City, Utah native Sage Kotsenberg made the snowboarding slopestyle run of his life, he tweeted, "Whoa how random is this I made finals at the Olympics!!!!" A little while later, the very first gold medal awarded in the Sochi Games was around his neck. On his final jump, the underdog nailed a trick he’d never even tried before, and it paid off. Almost as impressive as that faceplant you did slipping on a patch of ice outside the Science Center, huh?
2.    The U.S. men sweep the podium in slopestyle skiing.
 
Before Sochi 2014, the United States had only swept the podium—earned gold, silver, and bronze in a single event—twice in Winter Games history. This year, three U.S. men, Joss Christensen, Gus Kenworthy, and Nick Goepper, added a third to that in slopestyle skiing. This sweep is even more remarkable since this was the first time ever that ski slopestyle was an Olympic event; it was approved back in 2011 for Sochi 2014.
 
3.    Noelle Pikus-Pace comes out of retirement to clench silver in Women’s Skeleton.
 
Never heard of skeleton? Well, it’s basically the Olympic version of sledding; you’re face-down on a tiny sled, zipping down a slide made of ice at speeds of nearly eighty miles an hour. 31-year-old Noelle Pikus-Pace has been the face of U.S. women’s skeleton for years now, but there have been a lot of bumps on her road to an Olympic medal. She was injured prior to the 2006 Games in Torino. She then retired after failing to medal at the 2010 Vancouver Games until summer 2012, when she announced her plans to return and train as a Sochi hopeful. It was all worth it; she snagged the silver medal in Sochi a few days ago, just behind Great Britain’s Lizzy Yarnold.
 
4.    Meryl Davis and Charlie White earn the U.S.’s first Ice Dancing gold.
 
Meryl Davis and Charlie White, America’s ice-dancing sweethearts, have been skating together for seventeen years, since they were only ten years old. They earned silver at the Vancouver Games, but have since climbed to the top, winning two world championships by 2014. On Monday, they at last won the Olympic gold. The best part? Their moms have sat together at every single one of their competitions, and provide unwavering support and encouragement from the sidelines.

I was sitting at one of those coveted nook-desks in Lamont Library, merrily typing away at summer internship applications and finishing up some reading before lecture, when suddenly I felt a large, gaping hole emerging in my heart. And then I read Susan Patton’s Valentine’s Day editorial in The Wall Street Journal, and everything became clear to me.Ms. Patton is the author of "Marry Smart: Advice for Finding the ‘One’" and the mother of a son at Princeton University. Last spring, she wrote a letter to the editor of The Daily Princetonian claiming that young women had better make use of the nation’s top schools’ most important resources: eligible sperm-carriers.
In case we saucy co-eds had forgotten her wise words because we were too busy burning our bras or something, Ms. Patton issued a short reminder the day before Valentine’s Day in The Wall Street Journal that we had better spend the weekend hunting down and ensnaring innocent males, else we’ll be stuck alone forever, or worse with some guy from a state school. And, according to Ms. Patton, "when the conversation turns to Jean Cocteau or Henrik Ibsen, the Bayeux Tapestry or Noam Chomsky, you won't find that glazed look that comes over his face at all appealing." Totally."What are you waiting for?" Ms. Patton asks in her latest article. "You're not getting any younger, but the competition for the men you'd be interested in marrying most definitely is." And then I realized: I was living an empty and unsatisfying life because I spent too much time on trivial pursuits like completing a degree in English and finding a career when actually, I should be husband-hunting. I mean, I’m eighteen. I'm practically an old maid by 16th-century standards.Message received, I quickly closed my internship apps and scanned the library for potential suitors. I glanced up lustily from my psychology textbook at random passers-by. And then I tried demurely fluttering my handkerchief, because anything racier than that clearly isn't going to land me a man. I mean, as Ms. Patton told me, "he won’t buy the cow if the milk is free." After a long and grueling five minutes of this routine, I felt exhausted.
You see, I think Ms. Patton is right, but she doesn’t go far enough. By the time we women arrive at college, all of the attractive men are either decidedly uninterested, taken, or are our philosophy professors.  Clearly we need to start the husband-hunting process even earlier, so we can trap them before they obtain an understanding of their preferences, younger girlfriends, or tenure.I would like to propose that Harvard outsource its application process to Match.com. Girls, no need to bother with those pesky SAT scores and personal essays, because as Ms. Patton reminds us, men are more often interested in "less-challenging women" anyway. Instead, simply submit a picture of yourself and a list of your biggest turn-ons and turn-offs. The admissions office will do the rest, and come pre-frosh weekend, you’ll already have a pre-husband. Crisis averted.But writing this article has already taken up too much time for someone with a "biological clock ticking loud enough to ward off any potential suitors," so I better leave it to some smart man to figure things out for me.Now back to the hunt.
