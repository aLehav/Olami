After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The Valley of Love” has an interesting premise that shows great potential at least during the first half of the movie. However, the film’s abrupt ending negates these efforts and cancels out the momentum built up throughout the movie, ultimately condemning it to mediocrity.
The film’s plot begins attractively, and until the end it is difficult to predict how the story will end. As the audience follows the two main characters through a road trip in Death Valley to find their reincarnated son, circumstances seem normal, and there is no sign of their son. The two begin to understand each other again, and they talk about their son together for the first time in many years. Both Isabelle Huppert and Gérard Depardieu give brilliant performances as former husband and wife. Depardieu especially creates an interesting and relatable character: a disheveled, washed-up film star who is content with his retired life. He has grown fat, but does not really try to lose weight; he likes talking about the past, but is not too obsessed with it; although he often complains about Isabelle, deep inside he is still in love with her, and in some crucial scenes he shows touching tenderness both for her and their son. Huppert’s acting, on the other hand, is a bit overwrought in some of the more emotional scenes, but otherwise her representation is vivid and persuasive. While the film's subplot of a recovering relationship is somewhat clichéd, the main actors’ performances make it much more believable and touching than it would be otherwise.
Another strength of the movie is its interesting and in-depth depiction of America as an exotic land. While most of the film’s dialogue is in French, the story happens entirely in the Death Valley area, and director Guillaume Nicloux spends a decent portion of time on the seemingly unimportant scenes of the typical resort hotel, conversations with residents in the hotel, and the sights of Death Valley. There are also many details in the film that are typically American, such as the red “Death Valley” cap Depardieu’s character buys at a local store. All of these put together convey a subtle but mesmerizing atmosphere similar to that of “American Beauty” or “Blue Velvet,” and, in the case of “Valley of Love.”
However, “Valley of Love” has two obvious and fatal problems. The first is the split style of the film. While first half of the story seems to be nothing more than a warm road trip narrative about healing a marriage after the death of a child, the film suddenly turns surreal in its second half. This turn itself, while surprising, is not necessarily a bad choice; unfortunately, Nicloux returns to the road trip as soon as he creates a true sense of mysticism. It becomes increasingly evident that he can neither balance the two different narratives nor firmly choose one over the other. The second half of the movie ends up as a confusing mixture of family story and mythic travel.
A bigger problem, though, is the film’s ending. Not only does it fail to explain any questions raised at the beginning, but it also cancels out all the momentum that has led toward it. As the credit rolls out abruptly, the audience is left without guidance and potentially in disappointment and confusion.
For the greater part of its runtime, “Valley of Love” is a well-crafted piece with subtle acting and an interesting story. However, at some point during the production the director seems to have used up his skill set and the quality of the film declines steadily for its last thirty minutes.

Adapting a well-known novel is often a tough job, because the director has to face the choice between staying loyal to the original work and taking creative license. In the case of “The Little Prince,” director Mark Osborne completely restructures the household French fantasy by simplifying its themes and adding a completely original story. The result, however, is ambivalent at best.
The fundamental change that Osborne makes in adapting Saint-Exupéry’s novel is centering the story not around the Little Prince and the pilot who meets him in the ’40s, but a girl (voiced by Clara Poincaré in French, Mackenzie Foy in English) who lives in the 21st century and will attend a prominent middle school after her summer break. While studiously preparing for school under the discipline of her mother (Florence Foresti in French, Rachel McAdams in English), she meets her neighbor, the Aviator (André Dussollier in French, Jeff Bridges in English). Already an old man, he tells her about the story of the Little Prince (Andrea Santamaria, Riley Osborne) and so changes her ideas about her life.
The whole new narrative fundamentally changes the focus of the story. Saint-Exupéry primarily wrote autobiographical novels about wars and the lives of pilots, and, although “The Little Prince” is aimed at children, it contains many of his deepest thoughts on life. For instance, the Little Prince’s love for his rose, the core of the book, has to do with jealousy, attachment, loss, and trust, and it is as nuanced and sophisticated as any great love story. The film adaptation, however, completely ignores the novel’s sophistication. The relationship between the little prince and his rose is glossed over in literally less than a minute, and all the content in the book takes up around 30 minutes of the film. The rest of the movie focuses on the girl’s relationship with her mother, a decision clearly made for its targeted North American family audience. The complex themes are pared down to a simple child versus grown-up binary, where all grown-ups are emotionless working machines and children are naïve angels. The delicate melancholy throughout the original work vanishes and gives way to a sweetened comedy.
Although the themes are largely simplified, this added story still makes the narrative rather messy. Many important lines in the novel are stuffed in with little context, and the film frequently hurries through its plot without enough rest. Characters’ emotional transitions are swift and disjointed. Most importantly, though, the director shifts back and forth between the story of the girl and the story of the Little Prince, and he does not integrate these two threads particularly well.
That said, the film’s beautiful visual effects partly compensate for the problems with its story: The animation is nothing short of stunning. In a shot where clouds are presented as pieces of yellow cardboard surrounding the Little Prince, the animation is so gorgeous that even the pickiest audience might temporarily forgive the messy and over-simplified screenplay.
In “The Little Prince,” Mark Osborne essentially takes out all that makes Saint-Exupéry;s novel a classic and turns it into just another Hollywood family animation. While this may result in greater commercial success, it will likely let down fans of Saint-Exupery’s book.

This is the last part of our three-part series on the May 2015 Boston Calling music festival. The previous two parts can be read here and here.
While Saturday’s lineup was oriented toward pop, with artists like MØ, Tove Lo, and Marina and the Diamonds, Sunday put the spotlight on folk and country. Folk band The Ballroom Thieves opened the afternoon’s performances, and country acts The Lone Bellow and Jason Isbell carried the theme into the evening. Saturday’s pop stylings did see an outlet on Sunday in newcomer Halsey, who gave the day’s second performance and made her kinship with Tove Lo evident onstage, calling the artist her “girl” and saying she kept a picture of the previous day’s flashing incident saved on her phone. If Halsey, at 20 years old, is Tove Lo’s younger successor, she is a worthy musician for the job. Her dark-toned pop is reminiscent of that of artists like Grimes and Bat for Lashes; though perhaps not as unique as either of them, she sings her catchy tracks well and with energy. At the cusp of her career, Halsey is looking toward a bright future—perhaps, à la Marina and the Diamonds, she will return to a future Boston Calling to perform later in the day.
In contrast to Halsey, ILOVEMAKONNEN didn’t seem to be the sort of artist to joke around onstage—the quiet, almost sweet persona he projects in interviews was evident during his set, and he seemed earnestly floored by the audience response to his performance. As various think pieces have noted, ILOVEMAKONNEN has adopted a quiet, relatively feminine image that makes him more or less unique in the hip-hop world and has prompted speculation regarding his sexuality, to which he has appropriately refused to respond conclusively, stating such questions to be irrelevant. Though he may not have the onstage intensity of many other rap performers, ILOVEMAKONNEN, who surged to popularity after Drake remixed his track “Club Going Up on a Tuesday,” demonstrated to Sunday’s audience that a rapper with a softened image can easily put on a compelling show.
Soon after, according to Boston Calling’s initial schedule, electronic artist Chet Faker would have performed; due to an injury, however, the planners invited back New York indie pop act Lucius, who had performed at Boston Calling in September 2013. The group—centered around Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig, a duo of lead singers and best friends— displayed versatility with strong performances that ranged from rock to folk to straight-up indie-pop. The pair was remarkably in sync, and their friendship onstage was charming, particularly when Jess brought a cake onstage for Holly’s upcoming birthday.
TV on the Radio then brought in a surge of momentum to put on one of the best sets of the festival. They proved themselves to be the sort of group one falls in love with live: Though their studio versions are excellent, their tracks seem designed to be performed. Their frequently thick instrumentation—layers of guitars and synthesizers—was capable of filling the open space of City Hall Plaza in a way no other group quite accomplished. And as he sang, lead vocalist Tunde Adebimpe danced about in a wonderfully bizarre fashion, twisting and tangling his arms.
Though in a rather different fashion, Tenacious D, the next group to perform, was equally suited to live performance. Jack Black and Kyle Glass make entertaining music, but the highlights of their set were the moments when they talked or otherwise moved beyond just performing their tracks. Jack Black in particular was absolutely hilarious in every action he took—particularly when he, completely inexplicably, changed from a shirt depicting an enormous panther face into one covered with Targaryen sigils (from George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series) and subsequently into a shirt with a white tiger face. Comedy and extemporaneousness go hand in hand, and so Tenacious D live is the form in which Tenacious D is meant to be heard.
The last artist of the festival, the Pixies, was appropriately placed—they began making music in the ’80s, and so their history exceeds that of any other artist who performed over the weekend. For this reason, some of their songs—“Here Comes Your Man” and “Where Is My Mind”—incited the entire audience to sing along. And this was such an enormous deal of fun that the group can be forgiven for taking somewhat of a cop-out and repeating those songs during their encore. Though the Pixies’ major albums all came out over a decade ago, they sounded mature rather than dated; notably, too, bassist Paz Lenchantin, who only joined the band a couple of years ago, put on a spectacular performance and seemed entirely at home onstage with Black Francis and the other members.
Just before this final performance, Boston Calling’s organizers finally announced the lineup for September’s instance of the festival, which is to be headlined by The Avett Brothers, alt-j, and Alabama Shakes. As indicated by the whoops and cheers that accompanied the announcement of each artist, September should expect quite the audience.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, the Class of 2015 will pass from the ranks of Harvard undergraduates into the ranks of Harvard alumni. This end of senior year is undoubtedly a sentimental period for many, a time of reflection, nostalgia, and anticipation as college ends.
Along with the major milestone of college graduation comes one additional opportunity: Senior Gift. An annual tradition described by the Harvard Alumni Association somewhat euphemistically as “an opportunity to educate Harvard students about the importance and impact of alumni giving,” the Senior Gift permits seniors to make a small, restricted-use donation to Harvard. Though the marketing surrounding this year’s Senior Gift was controversial and unhelpful, the notion of a graduation gift remains a productive way for students to give back to an institution from which they have benefited.
All the same, this year's Senior Gift campaign fell short of its potential. It seemed to veer dangerously into peer pressure and shaming to collect the token donations the University sees as so formative. By encouraging those who donated to change their public Facebook profile pictures and approaching individuals in dining halls when surrounded by friends to ask if they have given, organizers too often appeared more interested in reaching a participation target than respecting their classmates’ individual abilities and inclinations to give.
Still, the concept of a Senior Gift is valuable. After four years at Harvard, everyone has benefited in one way or another from the school—living in a great House community, playing for an excellent sports team, gaining terrific academic experience, or simply picking up a prestigious diploma. Yes, there is no debt to repay, and Harvard has no right to donations. But after four years, nearly all undergraduates likely look fondly on some aspect of their college experience, and may want to ensure that others get the same chances they had.
The Senior Gift is not intended as a financially significant way for graduating students to fill Harvard’s coffers. It is a truth universally acknowledged that Harvard has quite a lot of money, and five dollar gifts by seniors are unlikely to move that needle. But the issue should not be conceptualized through the lens of the endowment; after all, Harvard makes clear that the Senior Gift does not go toward it. Instead, it is a way—part symbolic, part impressively tangible—to quite literally pay it forward. If five students gave a 20-dollar restricted financial aid gift, that would be enough to pay for a textbook for an entering freshman. Multiplied by the size of the graduating class, that makes a difference.
Today, fundraising makes Harvard’s revolutionary financial aid initiative possible. It supports cutting-edge life-saving research in medicine, environmental science, and public policy. It ensures the lights are on and the water comes out of the faucet. And, yes, it also pays for the one-ply toilet paper, spotty WiFi, and tomato-basil ravioli soup. Harvard’s fundraising is not an end in itself—it’s an attempt to enable the teaching and research from which we have all benefited. Harvard wants to help seniors to chip in towards that mission. We should applaud that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Look to your left. Look to your right. By Thanksgiving, one of your neighbors won’t be here.”
The teacher at the front of the auditorium addresses the crowd of 15- and 16-year olds planning to enroll in Advanced Placement United States History. Amidst a sea of nervousness, I cross my arms and straighten my back, confident that I will do well in this course.
Six years later, on a chilly evening in March, I trudge into a basement lecture hall. As I slide into my seat, the director of undergraduate studies in my concentration congratulates the assembled seniors. “There were 66 people in the sophomore tutorial. 51 of you have successfully turned in your theses. That’s not something everyone can do!”
One by one, images of my classmates who will not graduate with me this May flash before my eyes: those who left school to take care of their families; those who could no longer afford tuition (contrary to legend, Harvard financial aid sometimes doesn’t work out!); those who had been forced out when the university failed to provide them with the physical or mental health services that they needed. Most of them will come back. Some will not.
The director of studies beams. I am supposed to be proud, but instead I am sad, angry.
As I listen, my mind fades out of the lecture hall and into dorm rooms, laundry rooms, basement corridors, the banks of the Charles—those places marked by late-night crises, tears, hugs.
“I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know how to make him stop.”
“I need to go. I need to make sure that she doesn’t die. I’m the only one who can be strong.”
“I can’t do it anymore. I give up.”
By and large, these painful stories are hidden from public view. There is something shameful here about admitting to defeat, admitting that we have not overcome all of the obstacles we have faced. Harvard is the “best” school in the country (read: we are the most likely to reject our applicants); we celebrate success. We praise each year’s Rhodes Scholars and Phi Beta Kappa inductees, and the Crimson even runs glowing profiles of students who drop out to start companies, compete in the Olympics, or dance professional ballet.
Those who can’t be placed into narratives of achievement disappear from Harvard’s collective consciousness. We laud those who are succeeding and ignore our classmates’ struggles.
The director of studies tells us that consulting firms love to hire thesis-writers. In other words, the intellectual or social value of our theses pales in comparison to their symbolic value and their utility in helping us gain more success.
Again, my mind fades out of the lecture hall and into my own bed. Overwhelmed by depression, I can barely bring myself to shower, let alone conduct research or write. Thinking back on these times, I know that I was saved by lifelines of privilege—automatic faculty sympathy thanks to my white skin, a supportive family just a few miles away, financial stability. These lifelines have allowed me to mess up, to behave “irresponsibly,” to go through various troubles and pains, and still be deemed successful.
As commencement approaches, Harvard will encourage my classmates and me to think of our college years as times of happiness, success, and achievement. We drink champagne in Annenberg and reminisce about good memories; we are instructed to think of our bright futures ahead.
And what of our friends whose futures look less bright? Why think of them when we have fellowships and job offers and grad school acceptances ahead of us? We worked hard. We pursued our passions. We have succeeded. We are the chosen, the elect.
Some call this meritocracy. I call it schadenfreude.
And as the successful ones celebrate our accomplishments, we will forget about, or justify, the ways in which Harvard fails so many of its students. We leave behind our classmates at school.
But even more, we leave behind those we left before we came here: high school classmates, old friends, neighbors, workers at local stores, folks who live in the “bad part of town.” We learn to see others’ struggles as proof of our own worthiness.
Wrapped up in our own achievements, we forget that our new employers make their money by buying out companies, destroying jobs and businesses or by manipulating markets and causing mass home foreclosures. We lose sight of the connection between our profits and others’ poverty. We forget the ones we left behind, and we push others further behind still.
But sometimes, something called empathy or friendship or love brings us back. Something compels us to see our classmates who are struggling to keep up with the work not as “lazy” but as facing a unique set of difficulties, to see workers on campus and in local fast food joints as just as worthy of a life of dignity and respect and security as we are.
As Emma Lazaurus once said, “None of us are free until all of us are free.”
Something compels us to organize for change, to fight for a world where no one is left behind.
Some call this socialism. I call it basic human decency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In recent weeks, various Asian-American organizations have mobilized to take a stand on the role of race in Harvard’s admissions process. Among them, Harvard’s Asian American Brotherhood rejected the hypothetical use of racial quotas, should they exist in Harvard admissions. A few days ago, 64 Asian-American groups across the nation filed an administrative complaint seeking to dismantle race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard University and charging the school with an “unlawful use of race.”
Both of these events coincide with the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard by Project on Fair Representation which has employed Asian Americans as racial mascots for the anti-affirmative action debate. POFR’s lawyer Edward Blum, a veteran opponent of affirmative action, launched Harvard Not Fair and its two sister websites, UW Not Fair and UNC Not Fair, with stock images of Asian-Americans and bolded lines inquiring: “Were you denied admissions to Harvard/UW/UNC? It might be because you’re the wrong race.”
In response to these recent events, as two Asian American students at Harvard, we would like to add nuance to an oversimplified debate and question the assumption that consideration of race in admissions constitutes anti-Asian bias.
Affirmative action does not constitute racial quotas. Asian American commentator Jenn Fang explains how commonly cited admissions statistics used by affirmative action’s opponents, such as those by Thomas Epenshade, exaggerate evidence of anti-Asian bias. She suggests that Asian-Americans face a disadvantage when compared to white students, not other students of color, when applying to institutions of higher education. And, within the Asian American population, Espenshade’s data shows higher probability of acceptance for lower-class Asian Americans, which hints that underrepresented Asian ethnicities who also tend to come from lower-income families still benefit from affirmative action.
Current affirmative action policies consist of “race sensitive holistic admissions policies.” These policies only begin to level the playing field in a society where racial barriers continue to limit educational opportunities for students of color. Acknowledgment of race as a facet of identity and structure of inequality contributes to cross-racial understanding, empathetic learning, and reduction of stereotyping and isolation faced by minority students. Holistic admissions policies, which consider race as just one aspect of an applicant’s personal story, thus operate to admit a diverse study body across a range of social indices.
We stand in solidarity with black and Latinx students who so frequently bear the brunt of criticism for policies such as affirmative action. We as Asian-Americans cannot buy into the rhetoric of college admissions as a zero-sum game among minority students. The United States is quickly becoming a country with a majority-minority population, but white students still comprise over 60 percent of the college student population.
We implore the Asian-American community at Harvard and beyond to take note of these nuances and think critically before pointing the finger at a policy that seeks to bring some measure of justice to higher education.
At the same time, we share concerns about how well affirmative action functions in providing opportunities to disadvantaged populations. Based on the evidence, we do not believe allegations that Harvard has instituted a racial quota against Asian Americans. However, we do agree that Harvard and other institutions of higher education must make their admissions processes more transparent.
In contrast, questions about how legacy preferences preserve inequality in Harvard’s admissions process demand answers. According to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67, the acceptance rate for legacies has hovered around 30 percent, a number that is nearly six times the general acceptance rate.
We also wonder whether the admissions process takes the extreme disparities within our communities into consideration with regard to socioeconomic status and refugee condition. An enormous range of experiences can easily become smeared under the umbrella term “Asian American.” To ensure affirmative action does its job, Harvard must release disaggregated data on its admitted pool and ensure its admissions officers recognize the range of experiences of students of color.
Beyond admission of a diverse student body, Harvard must also ensure it provides a welcoming environment for students from marginalized backgrounds by supporting its still under-resourced ethnic studies programs, addressing the lack of culturally competent support services, and giving students of color a space on campus (preferably above ground) where they can meet and build community with one another.
For all the charges of racism that one could level at Harvard, an oversimplified call to eliminate the use of race in admissions should not be one of them.
Asian Americans are not your wedge. We support equal opportunity in higher education. We support affirmative action as a mechanism to accomplish that goal. And in the ongoing battle over Harvard’s admissions policies, we hope that communities of color can come together to make their voices heard on this campus.

On May 15, The Crimson reported that several Harvard Management Company executives saw significant jumps in their compensation between 2012 and 2013. Stephen Blyth, then head of public markets and now HMC’s President and CEO, saw his pay roughly double from $5.3 million to $11.5 million, while head of alternative assets Andrew G. Wiltshire saw his compensation increase from $7.9 million to $8.5 million. Natural resources portfolio manager Alvaro Aguirre-Simunovic enjoyed a $3 million increase in compensation, from $6.6 million to $9.6 million. In the past, such jumps in HMC compensation have sparked controversy – as recently as last August, members of the Class of 1969 wrote a letter to the University complaining about the total compensation of HMC’s managers. Seen in context, however, Harvard’s compensation of those who manage its endowment is both necessary and worth the price tag.
Just considering the size of Harvard’s endowment gives some idea of the need for and importance of good management. Harvard recently renamed its School of Public Health because of a $350 million gift, but a puny one percent increase in the size of Harvard’s $36.4 billion endowment would accrue about $364 million to the University. Given that the return on Harvard’s endowment for the fiscal year that ended in June of 2014 was 15.4 percent, and 11.3 percent the year before that, the HMC executives are regularly earning the University many times the value of the School of Public Health gift. While the relationship between the return on the endowment and the endowment’s contribution to the University’s operating budget is indirect, more money to generate funds for critical expenses is always welcome.
Moreover, any fair analysis of HMC executive compensation must take into account the unique way in which Harvard chooses to manage its endowment. Most universities use outside asset-management companies; HMC uses what it calls a “hybrid model,” in which it manages the endowment “both on an internal trading platform, as well as through investment arrangements with third party managers.” Harvard estimates that it saves “more than $1.5 billion in management costs compared to what an equivalent external management strategy would have cost over the past decade.”
In addition to this cost saving and the general significance of the endowment, the increased compensation for Mr. Wiltshire and Mr. Aguirre-Simunovic represents the key role that investments in timber plantations have played in Harvard’s endowment, especially since 2008. As head of alternative assets and natural resources portfolio manager, respectively, Mr. Wiltshire and Mr. Aguirre-Simunovic manage these innovative and profitable investments, and their compensation reflects their success. Harvard, it seems, has been “yelling timber” long before Kesha made it cool.
In short, Harvard derives significant benefits from its endowment, and it needs the best managers possible to take advantage of its hybrid model. While the compensation of those managers is high in absolute terms, relative to the immense potential of the endowment and the world of finance, it is far from exorbitant. As an investment in Harvard’s future ability to fulfill its mission, the compensation of HMC’s executives has a high return.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five years ago this spring, I thought about killing myself for the first time. It wasn’t dramatic—it just dawned on me that if I fell asleep and never woke up, I wouldn’t have to face another day. It was a comforting thought. I was a senior at the time, staring down the barrel of my thesis and life after graduation, and seriously clinically depressed. Five years later, I am finally getting my life back, and it seems the appropriate moment to say what I wish someone had said to me when I was still at Harvard.
What I needed to hear was this: Don’t be embarrassed. Talk to your friends, family, professors, tutors, resident dean. Tell them that you’ve lost interest in your life, and feel neither happiness nor sadness—you just feel numb. Tell them your brain feels fuzzy and you can’t concentrate. You might be managing to muddle through, with the same determination that got you into Harvard in the first place, but it’s alright to admit that you don’t have it all together. Most people don’t.
If you think you might be depressed, here is the other thing I needed to hear: Go get help. You have a serious medical condition, not a failure of willpower or character. You are in pain, both physical and psychic. So go get professional help.
Also, think about taking time off to take care of yourself. I once heard Harvard described as a treadmill—if you slow down you’ll fall off, and it’s hard to get back on. It might seem unthinkable to take a semester off (it was for me), but the irony is you end up falling off anyway. Get professional help. You deserve it, and it’s the only way you’re going to get better. When depression doesn’t kill you, it can make you stronger—but it may kill you.
I’m not saying it will be easy—it’s not—but you will get better eventually, and sooner if you are kind to yourself. I wasn’t, and I lost several years as a result. I counted down the days until graduation so I could slink off and hide, and I literally fled the country. I lost touch with all of my friends, and with myself. I eventually had to take a semester off from life to deal with it. Nobody should have to go through that. If this sounds like you, go get help. If this sounds like someone you know, encourage that person to seek treatment.
Every so often there is an upwelling of support for students with mental health issues, and calls for reform, including a petition a few years ago from some of my classmates for a mental health fund and student activism that produced changes to University Health Services policies. This usually happens after someone comes forward to share their story, or when the community must confront another student suicide. So I am sharing my story, if only to remind students struggling with mental health issues that they are not alone, and should not be embarrassed.
If you are an alumnus with a similar experience, I would love to hear from you—let’s revive the conversation, and find ways to be more supportive as a community. I expect those who have shared my experience would say that Harvard’s resources could be better, even with the recent improvements. And if this resonated with you, please go get help. Everyone should make it to their five year reunion.

Staring out into the rows of students at a Harvard Kennedy School lecture, a professor asked, “Are there any questions?” Among the group of pre-professionals and twenty-somethings pursuing their degrees, a three-year-old raised his hand. That toddler was the youngest child of Anna Escobedo Cabral, a 1990 graduate of the HKS Master in Public Administration program. 
“I would try to put it down, but he would insist,” Cabral said. “He was only three, but he would always ask really great questions.”
This situation was not an uncommon occurrence for Cabral, who attended the Kennedy School while caring for four young children. “Because I was living on a limited income, a very tight income, they would come to school with me sometimes,” Cabral said.
Cabral has come a long way since her days of bringing her children to class. Her devotion to public service led to her nomination by President George W. Bush as the 42nd Treasurer of the United States in 2004, filling the vacancy left after Rosario Marin’s resignation to serve as the highest-ranking Latina in the Bush Administration.
Along with her impressive rise in politics, she has used her various positions to give back to others, all the while becoming a role model for youth in the Latino community. Ultimately for Cabral, public service was her way of answering a question she posed to herself: “How do I give back for these great gifts that I’ve gotten?”
A HELPING HAND
Growing up in California, Cabral, the eldest of five children, came from a family of modest financial means. Neither of Cabral’s parents finished high school, and Cabral said that her parents’ goal for her and her siblings was to graduate high school.
Intent on finding a full-time job in order to support her family, at the age of 16, Cabral decided that she wanted to graduate early from high school, without plans to further her education.
But Philip Lamm, a math teacher and guidance counselor at Cabral’s high school, argued that she was too good of a student not to pursue higher education. Cabral’s parents were originally hesitant, but Lamm was persistent in his efforts.
“He literally hand-wrote my application,” said Cabral, adding that he also assisted her in securing the necessary scholarship money. In 1976, Cabral enrolled at UC Santa Cruz.
But upon arriving on campus, Cabral said she experienced feelings of frustration and guilt. Many of her peers with similar abilities and intellect did not have a Mr. Lamm, she said, and therefore were not on campus with her.
“Everybody has a dream for a better life, it’s just that [Mr. Lamm] cared enough to go the extra mile,” she said.
STUDENT, POLITICIAN, MOTHER
Upon receiving her bachelor’s degree in Political Science from UC Davis in 1987 after transferring and taking time off, Cabral, now married with four young children, moved to Lexington, Mass. and enrolled at the Kennedy School.
Despite the challenges posed by balancing responsibilities to both family and academics, Cabral, who was no stranger to obstacles, remained determined to take full advantage of the experience.
“Somehow when you appreciate an opportunity you tend to get everything you can out of it,” said Luben Montoya, a friend of Cabral’s from the Kennedy School, reflecting on the outlook of many of his peers with similar backgrounds as Cabral.
Embracing an interest in international trade and finance, Cabral fully dedicated herself to her studies.
“I just followed my heart,” Cabral said. “I took every economics course I could.”
This ambition did not cease after she left Harvard. In 2004, shortly before Cabral was offered her position as Treasurer, she committed to a part-time J.D. program at George Mason University Law School.
Though working full-time as Treasurer, Cabral continued with the program, eventually graduating in 2008. Once again, she found herself in a balancing act, but this time she juggled her career and education.
“I was traveling probably 75 percent of the time as Treasurer. I studied a lot on airplanes,” Cabral said. “You have to do what you have to do.”
COMMITTED TO COMMUNITY
When Cabral was sworn in as Treasurer on January 19, 2005, she became the highest-ranking Latina serving in the Bush Administration. For Cabral, this was an honor, yet she notes that this did not necessarily influence the initiatives that she embraced.
“It created avenues that I would be able to follow, but in the end it is my own personal interest and ambition and passion that drive which direction I’m headed,” Cabral said.
For David L. Moguel, a friend of Cabral’s from the Kennedy School and a professor of secondary education at California State University Northridge, Cabral’s success as a Latina makes her a role model for his students.
“I show them the dollar bill and I show them Anna’s name on it as the Treasurer,” Moguel said. “It’s wonderful for a lot of kids in the L.A. area schools to see a Hispanic name on something so important as our currency.”
Still, Cabral sees her story as one extending beyond the Latino community, a testament to the greater role of a public servant.
“I think she recognizes that everybody has a responsibility to help others, and that’s something you can do to help others, be a positive role model and lend a helping hand,” said Cabral’s husband, Victor G. Cabral, who also received a degree from HKS in 1990.“I think she’s tried to use her position as Treasurer to do that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Few people can stand their ground against Antonin Scalia before a crowd of thousands.
In 1992, Artur G. Davis ’90 did just that to win the title of Best Oralist at Harvard Law’s Ames Moot Court Competition, considered one of the most prestigious extracurricular activities at the Law School.
Davis, a former U.S. Congressman who is currently running for mayor of Montgomery, did not always exhibit this eloquence and confidence. He arrived to Harvard in the fall of 1986 a shy and reserved student raised by a single mom in Montgomery, Ala.
Thomas A. Schwartz, a professor in the History Department at the time, said that despite his humble origins, Davis was someone who could “come to Harvard and just excel.” Davis worked as a research assistant for Schwartz for a year.
The diversity of thought and the rigor Davis found in his academic work at Harvard challenged him to consider the viewpoints of others in ways that have influenced his subsequent political career.
Davis translated his academic talents into a thoughtful approach that sets him apart from the polarized nature of party politics. Davis’s career—he has run as both a Democrat and a Republican—exemplifies this willingness to cross party lines.
“Harvard sensitized me to the fact that there is a thoughtful argument to be found on the side of most issues if you take the time to look for it,” Davis said. “I’ve always tried to have that approach in politics.”
A SHY START
Arriving at Harvard a shy teen, Davis was immediately struck by the academic opportunities that were available to him. He delved into his coursework with a passion to develop a burgeoning interest in politics; these academic pursuits took priority over college’s more social aspects.
“I was a pretty shy kid when I was at Harvard,” Davis said. “I was someone who was still very much trying to find my way in the world.”
Davis came from a public high school in Alabama without an advanced curriculum. and he knew enrolling in the University would present a new challenge.
“It was important to me that I belonged there,” Davis said “It was important to me to get a handle on my grades, it was important to me to make sure that I was mastering my coursework as best I could.”
Davis found his place in the study of government and history, so much so that 25 years later he retains a mental course catalogue of his favorite classes and professors.
“At that point in time, Harvard literally had an all-star cast,” Davis said.
While Davis did not allow politically-focused extracurriculars to distract from his studies, Joshua M. Levisohn ’90, Davis’s freshman roommate, said the future Congressman showed a keen interest in politics from his first days at the College.
“Artur was the government geek. Some people have memorized stats of baseball players or football players—that was what he was like with government,” Levisohn said. “We came in the fall of 1986, and it was the midterm; he knew who was running in all...[the] Congressional races.”
Every morning, Davis walked to the Out of Town News stand in Harvard Square to buy the latest issue of the Washington Post, a newspaper that covered Southern politics. This daily dose of Southern news fueled his ambition to someday run for office himself.
“I would intensely follow Doug Wilder’s campaign for governor of Virginia because I thought it might have something to do with the future life that I wanted to have,” Davis said.
‘A RARE REPUBLICAN’
Davis’s time at Harvard Law School solidified the confidence he would need to pursue those political aspirations. His time both at the College and HLS challenged him to question blind commitments to political ideology.
“I’m not sure that I ever would have had the nerve to go into politics without Harvard Law School,” he said.
Not only did Davis gain the confidence to pursue a career in politics itself, but he also defies the trend of politicians tied to the party line.
“I think he’s clearly someone who forged his own character,” Schwartz said. “He’s willing to buck conventions in so many ways.”
Seeing a sense of independence and thoughtfulness in his research assistant, Schwartz predicted that Davis would pursue a career in academia. Instead, Davis applied these traits to his political career.
“I’ve never been a deeply ideological kind of politician,” Davis said. “[That approach] has always struck me as the less rigorous way of looking at the world.”
Unwilling to be bound by extremism on either side of the aisle, Davis finds himself as a “rare Republican” in the political center. So much so, that he considers himself “un-nominatable” in a Republican primary.
In 2002, Davis defeated long-time incumbent Earl F. Hilliard in a heated Democratic congressional race, achieving the first political success of Davis’s career. After an eight-year Congressional tenure, Davis made an unsuccessful bid for governor of Alabama in 2010. He has since switched his party affiliation to Republican and hopes to win the Montgomery mayoral election in 2015.
Freshman roommates Cedric D. Ho ’90 and Levisohn both spoke of their initial surprise when they learned of Davis’s success as a politician. Looking back, Ho said he realized that even the Davis he knew as an undergraduate had the makings of a future Congressman.
“He had this really strong sense of self-confidence,” Ho said. “Clearly he had it inside him all along; that’s the most important thing, he had this inner strength.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While attending the United States Air Force Academy, Martha E. McSally performed stretches and exercises to elongate her 5 foot 3 inch height. She dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot, but one barrier, which others in her position might have considered insurmountable, stood in her way. Her petite frame came up just short of the 5 foot 4 inch legal requirement for fighter pilot clearance. 
Despite her efforts—hanging upside down and measuring herself only in the morning—McSally managed to increase her height by only half an inch.
This story is just one of many McSally’s friends and classmates tell of her time at the Academy and at Harvard Kennedy School. Without fail, friends describe her psychological and physical mettle, strength, and determination.
Despite failing to meet the height requirement and suffering a hand injury that required four surgeries to heal, she ultimately convinced the Air Force she was physically qualified to become a fighter pilot, and became the first American woman to fly in combat and to command an aviation fighter squadron.
McSally would go on to make good use of the master’s in Public Policy from the Kennedy School that she received in 1990, winning a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2014 and becoming the first female Republican Representative from Arizona.
Given McSally’s impressive list of achievements, one might expect a “stern, rough-around-the-edges, extremely stereotypical type-A person,” said John B. Ullmen, another 1990 HKS graduate who attended the Air Force Academy with McSally.
However, Ullmen, along with other friends and classmates, remembers McSally as a personable, kind, and thoughtful young woman. Friends say McSally stood strongly for her convictions but did not seek the limelight, a trait that has guided her career in the armed forces and in public service.
‘TOUGH AS NAILS’
McSally demonstrated her perseverance not only in her efforts to keep her dreams of flying fighter jets alive, but also in athletic successes that made an impression on those who knew her at Harvard.
Initially, McSally’s decision to attend HKS was a way to keep her “options open.”
“When you’re making decisions as a 22-year-old, they’re not often strategic,” McSally said. “It was very much…‘I’m going to buy myself some time so I can keep my dream alive to become a pilot.’”
Once at Harvard, McSally continued to embrace challenges.
While at the Air Force Academy, McSally had seen an Ironman event on television and was immediately drawn to the intensity and difficulty of the triathlon.
Although McSally was a seasoned swimmer and runner, having walked on to the swimming and cross country team at the Academy, she had no experience with cycling.
McSally joined the Harvard University Cycling Association. Unlike some other members of the group, she rarely missed a practice, even in the worst Cambridge weather conditions.
Renee M. Covi ’90 was an undergraduate and the third fastest female cyclist at the college level when she knew McSally. “There were plenty of times where it was...Martha, myself, and very, very few others,” said Covi. “She was really tough, really dedicated.”
For McSally, the training she received at Harvard was a “game changer.” She would go on to win the military division of the Hawaii Ironman.
McSally’s friends said that her athletic achievements exemplify her remarkable determination and dedication.
“If you saw her she was just this little petite thing,” said Covi, who recounted a story of McSally challenging other cadets to one-armed push-up competitions at the Air Force Academy. “She was just tough as nails.”
‘A MODEST WARRIOR’
While her classmates and friends look back and recall McSally’s displays of strength and toughness, they also remember the less showy elements of McSally’s character.
“I think she kept a low-profile,” said Brian C. Ruhm, who also attended HKS and the Air Force Academy with McSally.
For Ruhm, one of the most impressive parts of McSally’s HKS experience was her commitment to public service. McSally spent many weekends counseling and sharing her faith with inmates at a state penitentiary.
“I don’t think she told anyone about that. I think I was one of the few people who knew,” said Ruhm, who was impressed by how “she didn’t go to any lengths to draw any attention to it.”
McSally expressed surprise that her classmate remembered her service. “There’s no reason to be publicly putting what you’re doing on a billboard,” she said. “You just need to be serving others; I think we’re all called to do that.”
McSally was also a member of the Kennedy School Christian Fellowship. Jeffrey K. Barneson, the current president of Harvard Chaplains, attended meetings with McSally.
While the future Congresswoman held views that were more conservative than her peers, she “stood up for what she believed in, would fight for the ideas, but wouldn’t necessarily draw attention to herself,” said Barneson.
Since graduating from the Kennedy School, McSally has retained this inclination to voice her convictions. In 2001, she successfully sued the Department of Defense over its policy requiring servicewomen to wear body-covering abayas when traveling off base in Saudi Arabia. Despite the potential threat to her career, McSally said that she felt compelled to act on behalf of her female peers in the armed forces, given the platform she had as a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force.
McSally credits much of her “foundation of being taught about what moral courage is, and what leadership really means” to her education at the Air Force Academy, as well as to the discussions she had at HKS.
According to Ullmen, McSally’s conviction should not be ignored.
“It’s not a megaphone type-A, be loud and imposing type of presence,” he said. “In every room, she’s going to have something to say and something to contribute, and it’s going to be worth… listening to.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the fall of 1989, Paul S. Wylie ’90-’91 was enrolled in a foreign policy class at the Harvard Kennedy School. On Wednesday, he received his take-home midterm on Eastern Europe. On Thursday, the Berlin Wall came down. And the next week he was figure skating in a competition in West Germany. Such was the life of an Olympic-level skater enrolled at Harvard.
CRIMSON DREAMS
Wylie began his skating career at the early age of three in Dallas, Texas, following in the footsteps of his two older sisters. During his sophomore year of high school, he visited Harvard, performing in An Evening With Champions, a charity skating event hosted by Eliot House.
“I was dazzled by what I saw and really already began to long to come to Harvard,” Wylie said.
While he considered attending the University, some counseled him to postpone school and focus on his skating.
“In fact, Brian Boitano at one point said, ‘You know you just have to give up this school thing, this is ridiculous. You just have to focus and go back to school later,’” said Wylie, quoting another Olympic skater.
Wylie took two years off to train but did not lose sight of his dream to attend Harvard, eventually finding his way to the University with the hope of balancing his athletic career with his academic ambitions.
A JUGGLING ACT
“Sometimes I did it well, and sometimes I did it very poorly,” said Wylie. Being an active student could take a toll on his skating career; in 1991, he stayed in the States for an exam and ended up having to skate jet-lagged at the World Figure Skating Championships in Munich.
“I wound up really having a disastrous, almost a career-ending performance,” Wylie said.
But Wylie looks back positively on his experience at Harvard. “For me, the combination of the two activities was quite powerful,” Wylie said. “[Academics] almost enabled me to put at arm’s length some of the pressures and stresses of my skating.”
Wylie’s freshman proctor, Keith W. Light, said he recognized the athlete’s commitment to academics.
“Immediately it was clear that he was not a star athlete who happened to go to Harvard, but he was a Harvard student who happened to be a star athlete,” said Light. “For years...I would use Paul as an example of someone who did Harvard well.”
A SILVER LINING
A year after graduating, Wylie won a silver medal in the mens’ singles event at the 1992 Olympics in what was considered a major upset.
“It was really exciting and wonderful to have the experience of returning with a surprising silver medal, because I wasn’t supposed to do that well,” said Wylie.
Eliot House lit up the cupola in honor of his return from the win, a rare event at the time. “It was a really neat feeling to sense that celebration there,” Wylie added.
“My reaction was not only utter joy for him,” said Wylie’s Eliot House roommate Rob L. Soni ’90. “I had known how hard he worked...but I also distinctly remember thinking that he kind of got robbed, that he should have won the gold.”
Soni liked to attend Wylie’s events, wait for a quiet moment, and shout “EASY, KILLER!” According to Light, Wylie never flinched.
‘FIGURING’ IT OUT
Following his Olympic win, Wylie completely devoted himself to skating, touring with Stars on Ice, a theatrical production featuring professional figure skaters.
“For six years I went in for it, and I spent all the energy I could on competition and tours,” Wylie said. “At some point I really wanted off. I wanted to go to school, and pursue the next thing.”
Wylie returned to Harvard to focus entirely on academics at the Harvard Business School and took a corporate job at Disney following his graduation in 2000.
Today, Wylie has finally achieved a careful balance between his interests on and off the ice. Wylie currently lives in North Carolina with his wife and three children, coaches skaters, and works as a health and wellness trainer.
Wylie has maintained a relationship with Harvard through An Evening With Champions, a non-profit student-run committee that hosts an annual figure skating exhibition to raise money for cancer research, participating both as a performer and a host. He has fond memories of the show directly following his Olympic win. That night, he said, he celebrated not only with friends from Harvard, but also other professional figure skaters that performed in the show.
“It was as if two of my worlds with all of my best friends collided,” Wylie said. “It was just a really fun memory.”
According to Wylie, he also serves as an advocate for up and coming young skaters who are considering Harvard. He tries to write letters for skaters he thinks belong at the school, citing the discipline and ability to “get the work done when the chips are down” that skaters possess.
While the lifestyle of an Olympic-level athlete at an Ivy League University can be difficult at times, Wylie said he is confident in the ability of this generation to follow in his footsteps.
“They come ready,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though watching the sunrise through the window of Lamont Library was not something a Harvard student could enjoy until the fall semester of 2005, Jeremy A. Kahn ’90-’91 envisioned something like the Lamont all-nighter over two decades ago. Having a 24-hour library was one of the main goals of the Harvard Society of Nerds and Geeks, a group Kahn formed during the ’89-’90 school year.
The idea for the group, which Kahn said he envisioned as a combination of social club and advocacy group for campus intellectuals, came to him in the summer of 1989. In October, Kahn held the first meeting of the group, which would come to be known as SONG.
According to an article published in The Crimson on Oct. 17, 1989, Kahn was “pleasantly surprised” when 19 people showed up to the meeting—only 10 were needed for the University to approve the charter—and SONG was formed.
"This is for real,” said Kahn at the time, according to The Crimson. “We must encourage the outside world to take more notice of nerds and geeks and to recognize our value." 
Those interviewed for the 1989 article, however, were not fanatical with enthusiasm. Allon G. Percus '92 told The Crimson at the time that he went only because he “didn't have a problem set to do tonight, and I couldn't think of anything better to do.” Another attendee, Gloria K. Park ’91, showed up because she thought it was a joke put on by the Lampoon, according to the same article.
Among the initial ideas tossed around at the meetings were a computer program to match study partners, weekly protests outside of Widener or the Science Center, a “procrastination hotline” to help students during exam period, a 24-hour library, and extended schedules for shuttles to the bio labs for pre-med students.
SONG always had a light-hearted side. Among the proposals were party breaks—as opposed to the more conventional study breaks—and various other BYOB, or “Bring Your Own Book,” events.
Under the guidance of SONG’s graduate student adviser and co-founder Leonid M. Fridman ’85, however, the group would broaden its efforts to fighting what Fridman and others perceived as an anti-intellectual environment at Harvard and in the U.S. in general.
“I wanted to encourage [Kahn] to form a social network, so to speak, but I had an ideological axe to grind, so I thought that [SONG] would be a good combination of the two,” said Fridman, who was a resident tutor in Mather House at the time. “I had some thoughts about anti-intellectualism, and I thought that that would be a good marriage, to have some ideology behind a social club.”
Using the media to change attitudes around intellectualism would become central to SONG’s existence. According to an editorial piece in The Crimson published in January 1990, fewer than four months after its founding SONG had received coverage from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and even CBS Morning News.
Fridman and SONG certainly didn’t shy away from the attention. In a Crimson op-ed Fridman wrote that SONG “plead[s] guilty” to allegations of publicity-seeking, attributing the explosion in interest for SONG to a broader nation-wide concern about anti-intellectualism. Indeed, the day after that piece in The Crimson, the New York Times published an op-ed by Fridman that he called his “nerd manifesto.”
Originally penned as a description of the group written to satisfy the Harvard bureaucracy—in addition to the 10 signatures, a description of purpose was needed for the charter—Fridman said that he liked what he wrote and eventually faxed it to the New York Times, which published it.
“Usually the New York Times doesn’t publish too many unsolicited op-ed pieces, so there was a lot of media coverage because it clearly resonated culturally with many people about issues of education and values,” said Fridman.
Despite its defense of the purely nerdy, SONG’s membership was far from limited to those who spent every waking moment ensconced in a dense book. Gregory P. Gicewicz ’89-’90 was both a member of SONG and captain of the football team. In a piece Harvard magazine published in 1990, he spoke about the pressure to be “anti-academic.”
“Instead of our role models being athletes, maybe they should be straight-A students,” Gicewicz said at the time.
SONG’s alumni advisor, Paul M. Widerman ’83, an alternate for the U.S. 1984 Olympic wrestling team, was also a hybrid of nerd and jock culture. 
“Clearly people have some conception of what nerds or geeks are supposed to look like. I don't look like that, but somewhere in my own mind I think of myself as one," Widerman told The Crimson in December of 1989.
Despite the immense amount of media coverage SONG received, the group dissolved soon after Kahn graduated. The group lasted for approximately one year, hardly even a blink in the context of Harvard’s centuries-long history. Indeed, through the haze of 25 years, it is hard for the former members of SONG to remember much beyond the publicity. Gicewicz and Fridman were unable to come up with the names of anyone else in the society, and Kahn only recalled one other member, Michael L. Hutchings ’93, a fellow mathematician who is now a professor at UC Berkeley.
Gicewicz believes, however, that SONG represented the beginning of a greater cultural embrace of academically passionate nerds and geeks. Citing famous nerds such as Elon R. Musk and Bill H. Gates (formerly ’77), Gicewicz and Kahn believe that nerd culture and intellectual passion have become much more revered over the past few decades.
“The ideal, in a way, is changing from this kind of Rhodes Scholar ‘Renaissance man’ or the all-around athlete scholar,” said Kahn. “There is a sort of movement toward really doing what you believe in, doing what you want to do and really kind of an admiration for single-mindedness.”
While SONG has long since disappeared, its legacy lives on among current undergraduates. Aaron A. Slipper ’18, an avid mathematician, estimates that he is in Lamont Library from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. on a typical weeknight. When Slipper learned about SONG, he was thrilled.
“We should revitalize [SONG] and petition for a 24/7 library...so that on the weekend when a good portion of people are out partying, the virgins can continue to use the glorious facilities of Lamont to be nerds and geeks,” said Slipper.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the winter of 1990, a sophomore hung a Confederate flag in the window of his Leverett Tower dorm room. The student removed the flag from the window and rehung it out of the public view after a House tutor suggested that some members of the community could find it offensive.
In a Letter to the Editors of The Crimson submitted after the removal of the flag, Jon P. Jiles ’92 wrote that he hung the flag to represent the Southern values of his home; today, he added that he never intended to offend his fellow students. In 1990, however, the incident and a series of similar displays of the Confederate flag polarized the student body, questioning where to draw the line between freedom of expression and harassment.
While students who were on campus agreed that Harvard administrators did not formally constrain the way students conveyed their beliefs, they added that the general climate of the student body exerted social pressure, determining what could and could not be said.
“At the time when I was [at the College], there seemed to be a lot of talk about freedom of expression,” Jiles said. “But if the expression wasn’t the politically correct expression, then it wasn’t as accepted.”
DEMANDING A VOICE
“I was born in the South. I was born a rebel,” Bridget L. Thomas ’91 said in an interview with The Crimson in 1991. Thomas, whose maiden name is Kerrigan, also hung a Confederate flag in her dorm room.
Unlike Jiles, and a third student who hung a Confederate flag, Thomas refused to remove the flag in the face of criticism. She said at the time that she believed the flag was a symbol of Southern “honor and grace and dignity.”
Students like Thomas, Jiles, and John M. Eggert ’90, the third student, sought to express their beliefs despite their unpopular nature at the College.
In response to Jiles’s decision to hang the flag, then Leverett House Master John E. Dowling ’57 said in an interview with The Crimson from 1990 that he believed offensive displays visible in the public eye should be removed.
“I remember thinking, ‘That makes no sense whatsoever,’” Jiles said.
For the students seeking to express minority viewpoints, these opposing interpretations of their actions stemmed from a misunderstanding on the part of the majority.
“[The Confederate flag] may not be a popular symbol up here because a lot of people misunderstand it,” Thomas said at the time.
According to David A. Plotz ’92, the liberal majority on campus had made political correctness the social justice issue of the time. Beginning college in the wake of the vibrant social movements of the late 1980s, Plotz and his colleagues entered into an activism “vacuum.”
“That was in the first era of discussion about what would now be microaggressions and trigger warnings. We didn’t have those terms. We had politically correct,” Plotz said. “It was about what was okay to say and what was not okay to say.”
At the time, Thomas pointed to the deliberate effort by a “politically correct” majority to invalidate the views of a conservative minority.
Thomas described Jiles’s capitulation and the removal of his Confederate flag as “a victory for small-minded liberalism and...a defeat for free speech.”
A FACULTY ‘RESPONSE’
In the face of controversy within the student body over the definition of free speech versus harassment, former University President Derek C. Bok assembled a faculty committee to develop a series of “Free Speech Guidelines.”
The committee was chaired by Government professor Joseph S. Nye, and included professor of science Henry Ehrenreich and Government professor Michael J. Sandel.
In the guidelines, adopted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in the spring semester of 1990, the committee emphasized the importance of free speech in an academic setting.
“As a community, we take certain risks by assigning such a high priority to free speech. We assume that the long term benefits to our community will outweigh the short term unpleasant effects of sometimes noxious views,” the introduction to the guidelines says. “Because we are a community united by a commitment to rational processes, we do not permit censorship of noxious ideas.”
According to Nye, these guidelines sought to prohibit the obstruction of free speech rather than to discourage speech that community members may consider offensive.
“The outcome [of the committee] was that preventing other people’s speech was clearly a violation and should be disciplined,” said Nye, “but there would not be a limit on content of speech—in other words, no hate speech type of limits.”
In a 1991 op-ed in the Boston Globe, Bok echoed the faculty committee’s commitment to free expression.
“One reason why the power of censorship is so dangerous is that it is extremely difficult to decide when a particular communication is offensive enough to warrant prohibition or to weigh the degree of offensiveness against the potential value of communication,” he wrote. “I suspect that no community will become humane and caring by restricting what its members can say.”
A DOMINANT MAJORITY
“My sense was that if you were a conservative at Harvard,” Paul S. Pottinger ’90 said, “you probably felt chilled to the bone.”
Despite the new faculty committee guidelines protecting students’ rights to express controversial viewpoints, the majority voice on campus—dominated by liberally-minded students—continued to persecute minority opinions.
“Most of the student body was very liberal, socially and politically,” Jim H. Colopy ’90 said. “People who were conservative would be less inclined to speak up because they would have felt uncomfortable and unwelcome.”
Jiles added that, contrary to formal University policy, those dominating the conversation seemed willing to curtail free speech for the sake of eliminating the possibility for offense or harassment—so much so that some students felt no choice but to keep their thoughts to themselves.
“There were a lot of students who had opinions but just did not voice them,” Jiles said.
Eggert’s experience displaying and later removing his Confederate flag exemplifies this disconnect between the faculty-approved “Free Speech Guidelines” and the reality of student life on campus at this time.
“Nobody made me take it down…They weren’t limiting my free speech at all,” Eggert said in an interview last week. “They made it clear to me from the moment I walked into the dean’s office that it was my right.”
Despite the faculty’s acceptance of Eggert’s choices, he said that he felt compelled to monitor the way he expressed himself publicly, to avoid provoking backlash from the overwhelming voice of the majority opinion.
“In terms of gender, sexual orientation, religion, you learned to watch your words a lot more than we had in the past,” Eggert said. “You didn’t want to offend people, even if it was accidental.”
Pottinger agreed that conservatives on campus engaged in this self-censoring to avoid having the campus “jump all over [them].” Pottinger and other liberal students, however, did say that the University should not formally regulate student expression.
“Should they be forced to take down the flag? We thought that was a terrible idea,” Pottinger said. “We thought they should absolutely take down the flag, that they should admit that they’re wrong—but that they should do it at their own free will.”
Twenty-five years after these controversies over freedom of speech and political correctness embroiled the College, Jiles said he has come to understand the value of checking potentially offensive views.
“There is a lot of room out there on campus and in society for a little more respect for people’s opinions and positions,” Jiles said. “Just because you can stick a flag up on the wall doesn’t mean you should do it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I was literally a pariah,” Sean P. McLaughlin ’91 said, summarizing his college years.
An outspoken Catholic conservative and a member of Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps, he remembered being forced to train off campus at MIT due to Harvard’s Vietnam War-era ban on ROTC. “I think that more than anything else defines my time at Harvard: feeling like an outsider in the University,” he added.
Conservatives on campus in the early ’90s felt they lacked an outlet for their voices and their opinions, which gave rise to the formation of organizations such as the far-right aligned magazine Peninsula, or the Association Against Learning in the Absence of Religion and Morality, AALARM. On the flip side of the political spectrum was the burgeoning gay rights movement, building momentum but still facing opposition on campus. 
Members from each side cited the feeling of being a minority in an at times oppressive community, despite bearing wildly different opinions. As the extreme viewpoints became more and more outspoken, Harvard was thrust into a period of fierce political debate.
AN 'EMBATTLED’ VIEWPOINT
Scott L. Merriner ’90 describes the Harvard of his time as a hard place to be conservative. “It was not very welcoming from freshman year to senior year,” he said. While not often faced with outright hostility, Merriner said the conservatives of the ’90s encountered an absence of venues for discussion of their views, be it in the classroom or the dining hall.
“For conservatives on campus, it was a little bit less than hostile. Something like ‘embattled,’” said Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53. “You were always on the defense; you had to have your arguments ready and have to face the surprise of most other students who are liberals who usually don’t hear conservative arguments and view conservatives as morally and intellectually defective.”
McLaughlin echoed these sentiments and said he felt that his own convictions were poorly represented at Harvard.
“I was always very strongly pro-life. Anti-abortion. I felt that there was just no voice for that on campus,” he said. Even in traditionally conservative circles, such as the Catholic Students Association, McLaughlin said he struggled to find like-minded students.
“I was bummed that here I am at the highest seat of learning and that’s been compromised,” said McLaughlin, discussing an event at Mass on campus where a student led a prayer in support of a pro-choice march. “It was just sort of another example of some of the key players that you would think would be in the debate having been muzzled and chained.”
McLaughlin’s viewpoints were frequently pitted against those of Thomas B. Watson ’91. An openly gay leader in the Catholic community, he and McLaughlin said they rarely saw eye to eye.
McLaughlin looks back lightheartedly on the perceived rivalry. “We became sort of the poster children for two different positions,” he said. “It’s almost more comical than anything else.”
A CAMPUS FOR ‘EVERYONE’
Watson prefaced any discussion of social issues with a portrait of the Harvard climate in the ’90s. “It seems almost inconceivable today, but on campus during that time in 1990, there were very few gay people that were out.” For those who were out, things were not always friendly. “There’s no question that there was intimidation and fear,” he added.
With non-random housing, the Houses developed their own characteristic personalities, which helped minority communities find each other and form cohesive units. Dunster and Adams were considered the hubs for gay life at Harvard, according to Watson.
Despite havens in certain Houses, many BGLTQ students felt that inclusiveness at the University as a whole had room for improvement.
“Having a facial campus policy of non-discrimination without teeth and without an actual culture that was welcoming and safe meant that that was a hollow promise for people,” said Kelly M. Dermody ’89-’90, a former leader of the Gay and Lesbian Students Association. “There needed to be many more expressed statements of fairness that manifested in systems.”
Dermody and others created a list of demands for the Harvard administration, including having a designated BGLT-sensitive tutor in each house and training freshman proctors to know how to engage effectively with newly-arrived BGLT students, often coming out for the first time while in college.
“We also did things that were really fun,” Watson said. “Our dances on campus were the best dances by far.”
But still, their progress was often met with resistance. Some Harvard students had strong reactions to the rising gay rights movement. “The political nature of the gay groups I think really did—I don’t want to say caused—but was part of what gave rise to the far-right-wing groups that sprung up on campus,” said Watson.
PENINSULA EMERGES
In early 1990, the Salient was the premier conservative voice in print on campus, but some felt that its stance was too weak on important issues. McLaughlin recalled the culmination of his frustration, walking out of a Salient meeting where his pro-life article had been gutted and then shot down. “And a lot of us left that meeting and said, ‘My gosh, are there no outlets for our school of thought here?’” 
McLaughlin began gathering like-minded, socially-conservative individuals to start a new periodical named Peninsula, after the sentiment that they were surrounded on all sides but one. They released themed issues, such as those on abortion or gay rights, with articles penned in a characteristically sarcastic style. Peninsula set out not only to provide a voice for their brand of conservatism, but to spark a debate on campus they felt was not present, and deeply necessary.
McLaughlin looked back on his time with Peninsula as a success.
“I think that by carving out the far right we created space for people to argue,” he said.
“Peninsula played a valuable role in bringing those particular sets of issues and those questions and those debates kind of out of the corner and more into the central space in dorm rooms and around the dining halls and even to a degree in the printed pages of The Crimson and the Salient,” agreed Merriner, an editor of Peninsula.
CONFLICT ON CAMPUS
Peninsula contained polarizing opinions that provoked extreme responses on campus, according to a 1991 feature about McLaughlin in The Crimson. Merriner said he remembers receiving a few threatening voicemails due to his work on the magazine, and jokingly attributes his and his girlfriend’s breakup to Peninsula’s first publication.
Merriner said the group was small and sometimes struggled to find the money with which to publish. Members distributed the publication at night, spreading it throughout the Houses and dorms on campus. An incident occurred in Quincy House in the fall of 1990 where an unidentified resident collected and destroyed copies of the magazine after they had been delivered, according to an article in The Crimson.
Despite what was at times vitriolic criticism, McLaughlin remains positive about the magazine’s overall impact on the campus.
“I know a lot of good conversations came out of it. I know we took a lot of hits. We took all kinds of abuse from the extreme sides of the argument,” he said. “In the end I would hope that people appreciated the timing and the difference of view.”
Peninsula targeted the gay community with an issue that chided homosexuality for being misguided and promoted support groups to help gay students change their sexual orientation. The focused nature of its issues evoked a strong response from the groups that found themselves under Peninsula’s critical lens.
“I do not, and did not, believe it was appropriate to discuss whether gay people are equal or not. I thought we were,” Watson said. “In the process they hurt an awful lot of people.”
Even before Peninsula’s time, these issues played out on campus. In one particular incident, Dermody recalled a gay student allegedly being harassed during a dance in Mather House in February of 1989. In response, Dermody and other BGLT activists engaged in a “kiss-in” at Mather Sunday brunch.
“We wanted to get across to the Harvard community that we are allowed to be visible. We are allowed to be here. We exist,” Dermody said.
Following the Mather incident, many residents of the House, in solidarity with the BGLT students, hung pink triangles outside of their windows, a symbol used by the Nazis to mark gay citizens that had been reclaimed as a symbol of pride by the gay community. 
In a plan organized by AALARM, more conservative-minded House members displayed blue squares in their windows or on their persons in defiance of the BGLT activism.
Watson recalled the blue squares in Mather windows. “That was extremely intimidating and terrible for so many students,” he said.
According to Dermody, the extremity of the conservative response alerted uninvolved segments of the student body to the issue of gay rights on campus.
“We got so attacked by the conservative groups that I think it alerted people who didn’t think once about the existence of gay people to sympathize immediately,” said Dermody.
TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER
Despite the clashes between liberals and conservatives, the editors of Peninsula look back fondly on their contributions to political discourse on campus.
“I thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of debate and argumentation and thought that accompanied my time there,” McLaughlin said. “I think that’s what college is about. You’ve got to push everything. No other time in your life you feel that vibrancy.”
Merriner recalled the camaraderie he found as a member of Peninsula.
“I found the undergraduates that got involved with Peninsula were some of brightest, most engaging, most generous people I ever met at Harvard,” he said. “They were great young people. They weren’t out to pick fights. They genuinely believed that those perspectives needed to be voiced and that everyone would be better off with further dialogue.”
Watson looked back somewhat differently on his involvement in political debate at Harvard.
“The most positive thing I can say is that Harvard was in many ways a lab that launched many different activists,” he said. “We could see that history was changing and that we were right and that we knew it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In black and white photographs from 25 years ago, long-haired undergraduates in winter coats stand brandishing posters open-mouthed, perhaps in the middle of a chant.
“Join us if you’re with us,” reads one poster. “White politics won’t end apartheid,” reads another. “Human rights means hands off in South Africa,” reads a third.
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, these students made headlines by urging University administrators to pull Harvard’s investments from firms that did business with the apartheid government in South Africa, though Harvard never fully divested, despite continued protests.
Around the same time, however, Harvard’s involvement with another lucrative industry, tobacco, did not trigger such widespread attention, in part because the University announced its decision to divest its stocks from tobacco companies in May 1990.
When asked about these movements, former University President Derek C. Bok, whose tenure spanned 1971-1991, wrote in an email that the presence of campus protests was “obviously accurate in the case of the issue of investments in South Africa.”
For the University’s top administrator at the time, student opposition to Harvard’s investment in the tobacco industry were less visible.
“In the case of tobacco, however, there were no student controversies or any other protests leading up to our decision to divest, nor did protest activity of any kind play any role in the decision of the Corporation,” Bok added in his email. “I was never asked to meet with anyone or any group at any time prior to the decision.”
Throughout the 1990s, movements centered around apartheid, tobacco, student diversity, and ROTC created an atmosphere of protest on campus, according to Randal S. Jeffrey ’91, the Chair of the Undergraduate Council’s ad hoc committee on divestment from apartheid and a member of the Southern Africa Solidarity Committee.
“A lot of the folks were involved in some of the different protests’ issues,” Jeffery said. “I definitely think they complemented each other.”
While administrators harbored mixed feelings for the anti-apartheid and anti-tobacco movements, on the whole they acknowledged students’ interest in the issues and right to protest respectfully.
“I would say that the mood on campus was generally positive to both of these campaigns, but it was not intense [like political action of the 1960s],” said Everett I. Mendelsohn, who was a History of Science professor at the time. “By 1990 there was a level of understanding: ‘Yes, something like this should come up.’ It didn’t rise to a great crescendo.”
SOUTH AFRICAN SOLIDARITY
Jeffrey recalled waking up early in the morning with his peers to take a stand against the University’s investment in South African companies 25 years ago.
In an age before social media, they used flyers to publicize their cause. “The flyers were definitely effective,” Jeffrey said. “We would get up at 7:00 a.m. and get them up before the other folks were able to use up space on the boards.”
Conversations around complete divestment from companies that did business in South Africa and what some students called larger moral problems—some of which started in the 1970s—sprang up in articles in The Crimson and protests on campus throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
On Oct. 2, 1990, Jeffery, as chair of the UC’s ad hoc Committee on Divestment, wrote an editorial in The Crimson outlining his views on what he called the University’s problem with selective divestment in South Africa-related companies and businesses.
Bok argued against complete divestment from the South African companies, citing what he called “‘non-rational’ judgments” on the part of the student protesters and “brutal repression” in other countries that had gone unrecognized, according to The Crimson and the 1989-1990 President’s report, respectively.
The 1990 mid-year report on Shareholder Responsibility, moreover, indicated that the University’s investments in South Africa had increased $30 million to a total of more than $168 million, The Crimson reported.
“[The administration] certainly acknowledged the position we were advancing,” Jeffrey said in an interview last week. “It was important both to make our voices known on campus as well as send the message...apartheid was something that we strongly disagreed with.”
By April 1990, anti-apartheid activists and Bok had reached a standoff. Meeting with four members of the UC’s ad hoc committee on divestment, Bok said he “had not been swayed, or impressed, by the undergraduates’ presentation,” The Crimson reported.
Mendelsohn said the disconnect between Bok and the protesters led students to promote the cause on their own.
“It struck me that the University administration at the time was misreading what was happening in South Africa,” Mendelsohn said. “My sense is that the major activity and thrust in the divestment was student-led.”
Mendelsohn also said he recalls several faculty meetings, during which some professors who he thought would not be vocal on the issue raised their voices against the stance of the University.
“The divestment from South Africa was a move that many faculty supported,” Mendelsohn said. 
Despite student and faculty support for divestment, administrators followed a different path, arguing that divestment from South African companies would be detrimental for the University’s finances.
“If Harvard were consistent in pursuing social justice through divestment—if it merely agreed to divest from all companies doing business in countries suffering from severe political oppression—the number of black-listed firms could easily be long enough to push our losses to high levels indeed,” Bok wrote in the 1989-1990 President’s report.
TACKLING TOBACCO
In an October 1988 Crimson editorial entitled “Blue Smoke and Mirrors,” John J. Murphy ’89 wrote that the University “wield its influence as a stockholder to influence the tobacco companie” on the grounds that the industry promoted a harmful activity.
Twenty-five years later, however, Murphy said that, on his own, he would not remember discussions around tobacco.
“If you had asked me for a list of protests I knew about or had seen, I wouldn’t have even come up with a tobacco-related controversy,” Murphy said in an interview.
In other University schools, however, students played a more active role in protesting Harvard’s investment in tobacco.
Philip P. Huang, who graduated from the School of Public Health in 1990, for example, made a radio advertisement, targeting Bok’s decision to invest the University’s finances in tobacco companies. 
Huang said Bok sent him a letter in response, which stated that Harvard no longer had any holdings in tobacco but failed to clarify whether the University had divested. In turn, Huang said he gave Bok’s letter to the media, including reporters at The New York Times and The Boston Globe, in an effort to pressure the University.
“The media asked them, ‘Have you divested,’ and it really pressured them to take a stand about divestment,” Huang said.
Bok in the 1989-1990 President’s report wrote about tobacco’s relationship to human health as the chief and singular reason influencing the decision to divest from the tobacco companies.
“Harvard has sold its stock in tobacco companies because of their demonstrated health effects, especially in the light of mounting cigarette sales to persons too young to evaluate the risks and to inhabitants of foreign countries where warning labels are not required,” Bok wrote.
Mendelsohn recalled that the discussions around tobacco took a different tone and elicited different reaction than the anti-apartheid protests on campus.
“The tobacco issue was there,” Mendelsohn said. “I thought that students had a perfectly good case to make. In a sense it had a different moral suasion than the anti-apartheid issue.”
In a letter dated May 18, 1990, Bok wrote that Harvard had decided on divestiture from the tobacco companies, The New York Times reported. Divestiture began in September 1989 and had been completed in March 1990, according to the Times.
DIVESTMENT TODAY
Fast forward 25 years: Dots of blue light punctuate an unseasonably warm April night. Taken together, the tiny lights spell the words “Divest From Fossil Fuels” and are held up in front of Massachusetts Hall by current students, alumni, and other advocates for the University’s divestment from fossil fuels.
The 1990s protests, in part, paved the way for current calls for divestment, according to some students, alumni, and professors.
Members of Divest Harvard, the student organization currently urging University President Drew G. Faust to divest the University’s endowment from fossil fuels, said they see their protests as part of a larger historical continuum of students pitted against the University around divestment issues, according to group leaders.
“When you look at activism on college campuses, one of things that stands out is the South African divestment movement,” said Divest Harvard co-founder Chloe S. Maxmin ’15.
Canyon S. Woodward ’15, another member of the group, agreed with Maxmin, saying that Divest Harvard has looked to past protests for inspiration.
“I think our movement is definitely informed by past ones, especially the tobacco divestment,” Woodward said.
Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 also drew parallels between the 1990s protests and today’s Divest Harvard movement, articulating that the underlying issues depend on different concerns.
“No sensible person smokes tobacco, and no decent person approves of Apartheid, but everyone relies on fossil fuels,” Mansfield wrote in an email.
Murphy said he thinks institutions like Harvard, through their choices and subsequent actions, have and can continue to give voice to certain issues.
“I do think universities play a role as sort of a moral compass in society,” Murphy said. “There can be power in them making a statement in where…to head for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kennedy School of Government Academic Dean Archon Fung will serve as Acting Dean of HKS starting on July 1, replacing on an interim basis David T. Ellwood ’75.
University President Drew G. Faust announced the move in an email to Kennedy School affiliates on Tuesday. Fung’s interim deanship will mark the end of Ellwood’s 11-year term. Ellwood, who announced his resignation last fall, is currently the longest-serving dean still in office and the only one not appointed by Faust.
Fung, who is one of several HKS faculty part of the committee advising Faust in the search for Ellwood’s long-term successor, has been a professor at the Kennedy School since 1999, conducting research related to direct participation and teaching courses on professional ethics and social change. Fung emphasized that as interim dean his role will be to continue and maintain rather than revise Ellwood’s vision for the school.
“It’s not really appropriate for an acting dean to embark on large new projects that will take a long time — that’s the prerogative of a dean,” Fung said. “And so what I’ll be seeking to do is strengthen the school on those dimensions that are really the mainsprings of the school that everybody thinks are important for the school to do what it does best.”
In addition to preserving the momentum of ongoing projects like the school’s campus expansion, which is already underway, Fung highlighted three priorities for his time as interim dean: maintaining the spirit of public service that is central to the Kennedy School’s mission, supporting the school’s academics and practitioners in cultivating a climate of energy and innovation, and maintaining the professional diversity of HKS faculty and staff.
Fung will lead the school during a critical phase of its capital campaign, which had raised $383 million toward its $500 capital campaign goal as of this February. In an interview then, Ellwood said he expected fundraising to “inevitably slow down” after he steps down, highlighting that philanthropy at the Kennedy School is based on confidence, trust, and long-term relationships, frequently with non-alumni, that could be interrupted by the transition.
“Dean Ellwood is exactly right—one of the main pieces of alumni relations and fundraising and development is long-term relationships with friends of the school who are often friends of the leadership of the school,” acknowledged Fung, who predicted his role in fundraising would be more focused on the “maintenance” of existing relationships. “But those people are also friends of the school as an institution.”
Fung added that the close integration of the Kennedy School administrative team and his role in the search process will ensure a smooth transition this summer.
“One great thing about the Kennedy School administration is that the leadership team is very, very coherent and so the people who report to Dean Ellwood meet very regularly with one another and with Dean Ellwood,” Fung said. “So the transition to me will be less abrupt than that because I’ve been involved in those conversations and will continue to be preparing the road and paving the road for the next dean.”

Almost a year after its creation, Harvard’s central sexual harassment investigation office has hired a second full-time investigator, although it still remains understaffed.
Amidst growing debate over its approach to handling sexual assault on campus and two federal probes into its compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, University leaders unveiled last July a new policy and set of procedures to overhaul Harvard’s investigation process. Among the most notable changes was the creation of the University-wide Office of Sexual and Gender Based Dispute Resolution, which would lead investigations of alleged policy violations across individual schools under centralized investigation procedures.
The office, although initially praised by student activists, quickly came under criticism as it remained understaffed. From the start of the academic year through April, the office had filled only one of its three full-time investigator positions and was relying on contractual work to manage its caseload.
On May 18, Ilissa Povich began work as the office’s second investigator, according to University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides. Povich, who is a graduate of Duke University and Harvard Law School, has for the past 10 months worked with lead investigator William D. McCants as a contractor for ODR.
The office has also made “significant headway” on hiring the third investigator, according to an emailed statement from University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga on behalf of Karvonides.
Additionally, the University’s Title IX Office is now soliciting applications for a “Title IX associate.” According to a job posting, the associate’s duties will include assisting the lead investigator as well as developing and implementing Title IX training at the University.
The lack of full-time staff at ODR, which investigated more cases of alleged sexual harassment this academic year than the University saw across all schools in 2013-2014, has prompted criticism from students. In a show of satirical criticism, undergraduates from Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student activist group, hosted a bake sale in December to raise money for the understaffed office.
Harvard affiliates have not only criticized ODR on the grounds of perceived staffing delays. In October, a group of 28 Law School professors condemned the University’s new Title IX policy and procedures in an open letter in the Boston Globe, arguing that the investigative process was “overwhelmingly stacked against the accused.” By late December, the Law School had adopted its own set of Title IX procedures that circumvent ODR and break away from the centralized investigatory model.

Fifty-two percent of eligible Harvard students completed the University’s sexual conduct climate survey, according to survey information from the website of Harvard’s task force on the prevention of sexual assault.
The survey, which launched on April 12 and closed on May 3, is a Harvard-specific version of an Association of American Universities poll being conducted at 28 schools across the country to gather data on sexual conduct. A week and a half after the release of the survey, 37 percent of students had completed it.
The release of the survey was accompanied by a large publicity push: Many of Harvard’s top administrators, including University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, sent students emails asking them to take the survey, and posters around campus advertised it. That effort was not without some hiccups, as some students conflated the climate survey with Divest Harvard’s “Heat Week” demonstrations and may have not responded because of its terminology.
Still, David I. Laibson ’88, an Economics professor and a member of Harvard’s sexual assault task force who helped create the national survey, previously suggested that the survey might yield a response rate of 20 to 35 percent. Students who participated in the survey received a $5 Amazon gift card.
“This is a huge success in my mind,” University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides said of the survey’s response rate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Class of 2015 has not had the easiest four years.
During their stay in Cambridge, the current crop of Harvard College seniors has witnessed a massive cheating scandal, the bombings at the Boston Marathon, and a bomb threat that put Harvard Yard on momentarily lockdown during finals. But at Tuesday’s annual Baccalaureate service, University President Drew G. Faust told a crowded and noticeably sweaty Memorial Church audience to “rise above fear and anger by connecting with others, with compassion and with understanding.”
“Your education gives you the capacity to harness fear using imagination—to treat sources of fear as a problem to be solved with creativity, thought and daring,” Faust said.
Faust’s speech followed several prayers and hymns in multiple languages, as well as readings from some of Harvard’s chaplains.
Joking that her task during the service was to “transmit the sober wisdom of age to the semi-sober impatience of youth,” Faust said most media today is dominated by fear and anger. She commended the Class of 2015 for its activist efforts to confront fear and advocate for change in what she described as “the most activist year in recent Harvard memory.”
This year, students have continued campaigns to push Harvard to divest from fossil fuels, blockading Massachusetts Hall for an entire week. Students also marched the streets of Cambridge in the fall as part of the “Black Lives Matter” campaign in the wake of the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York, as well as launching a new arts and advocacy magazine.
“Fear will be with us, but what do we make of it?” Faust asked. “One learns to manage fear, the way we learn any task, and I believe the education you have received over the past four years can not only contribute to addressing your own fears, but has given you tools to lessen the larger sense of fear that grips society as a whole.”
During lighter moments, Faust scored applause from seniors by incorporating references to widely used phone applications, such as Venmo, Uber, Snapchat, and even Tinder.
“Stay connected. Swipe right. Fear no fate. Carry other hearts in your heart. Do the thing you think you cannot do,” she said.
Faust also received a thunderous response when she commended the Class of 2015 for being the first to elect a joke Undergraduate Council presidential ticket.
Faust’s previous Baccalaureate speeches have advised seniors on “breaking good,” a reference to the television series “Breaking Bad,” and to “run toward.”
On Wednesday, actress Natalie Portman ’03 will address the seniors at the College’s Class Day. Former Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 will headline Harvard’s 364th Commencement on Thursday.
