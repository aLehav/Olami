After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Robert Rodriguez’s raunchy and  blood-soaked "Machete" franchise has grown up a lot from its birth as a  one-off trailer made for Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s gore-fest  "Grindhouse." "Machete Kills" is a two-hour jaunt through a violent  funhouse that, while just as insane and twisted as it markets itself to  be, often ends up as much a mess as the vigilante Machete’s trail of  destruction. "Machete Kills" is an entertaining movie when it manages to  be self-aware and engages with the audience; however, the movie is more  often sloppy and taxing than funny or compelling.
As anyone would expect from the title,  "Machete Kills" promises egregious amounts of violence, and it fully  delivers on those vows. Machete and the other characters in the film  tear and shoot their way through foes in ways that are equally  horrifying and ridiculous. The moments are always cruel and unusual, but  the ideas are recycled enough to make each successive action scene less  interesting than the last—Machete (Danny Trejo) uses a helicopter to  eviscerate someone several times throughout the film.
In moments of extreme violence and dialogue,  the camera work focuses on what’s important—Rodriguez does not shy away  from explicit close-ups of the goriest scenes. However, during the  interceding scenes, Rodriguez still insists on inexplicably focusing on  the characters’ feet far more than their bodies, which makes  understanding what’s going on rather confusing. Even amid these  alternately mediocre and chaotic shots, there are some inspired  cinematographic choices. In the middle of the movie, a security monitor  in the background gives the audience two simultaneous shots of a  relatively unimportant death, creating a surprising subtle moment in a  film that otherwise relies on garish spectacle to hold the audience’s  interest.
The characters’ development throughout the  film is similarly uneven. Along with the bloodbath, "Machete Kills" has  all the mild sexism that one would expect from a movie franchise about a  machete-wielding action hero: most women in the film seem to exist for  the sole reason of getting shot and upsetting Machete, which, while not  surprising, is regrettable. The dialogue in "Kills" relies on clichés  and catchphrases, even awkwardly dropping the movie’s title in the  middle of a pivotal scene. The things the characters say are predictable  line by line—save for a few rare deviations. The dialogue in the movie  is never in danger of feeling revolutionary, but when characters break  from their unimaginative molds, it gives the movie some unexpected  energy and drive. The main villains, rather than acting sinister, often  indulge in silly antics that undermine the gravity of their scenes—one  of the main villains, a gigantic "Star Wars" fan, gives Machete a tour  of his facility in a carbon copy of Luke Skywalker’s landspeeder from "A  New Hope."
The movie props up its C-list celebrities as a  selling point, and all of them succeed at bringing humor to the film.  Charlie Sheen, billed as Carlos Estévez, steals the film as the  foul-mouthed U.S. President, executing his often-questionable lines with  a vitalizing kick. The addition of Lady Gaga to the cast initially  seems tacked on, but her (admittedly limited) lines are well executed  and add to the experience of the film. While many of the secondary  characters of "Machete Kills" are smash hits, Machete comes across as  tired more than interesting. Trejo’s lines are often grunted more than  they are spoken, which is particularly problematic when his lines are  already borderline nonsensical. Furthermore, he often comes across as  not fully engaged in what is occurring around him in the film. When it  comes to many of the one-note characters, it’s unclear often whether  Rodriguez wants them to be flat and uninteresting or they just don’t hit  the mark. Whatever the intention, the guest stars end up as the driving  force of the humor in the film, carrying the film rather than its lead  or the plot.
The Achilles’ heel of a movie like "Machete  Kills" is the imbalance of the comedic nature of the film with the  serious themes that it broaches, apparent in the numerous racist jokes  made at Machete’s expense. The fact that "Machete Kills" fails to  balance these tones at all makes the movie a violent rollercoaster,  complete with emotional whiplash. Whenever the movie tries to do  something serious or emotionally significant, it is impossible to be  sure whether to take the motivations and inner feelings of a character  seriously or not, especially when it comes to the title character.  Because of this, anything that isn’t violence and sassy banter (a  category that is unfortunately broad) is annoying and exhausting to sit  through. The movie also uses prolonged gags to try keep the humor from  dragging, but they often end up producing the opposite effect—they’re  often far too repetitive or inexplicable to keep interest. One villain’s  car incessantly recites a spanish-to-english dictionary in each of its  appearances, which becomes unbearable after the fourth or fifth time.
The reality is that "Machete Kills" starts out  as the grisly and ludicrous sequel for which everyone was hoping, but  it peters out and dies before it manages to bring anything good to the  table.

We’ve got bills to pay.
That, in the most basic sense, describes the current debt ceiling crisis: Congress has already authorized certain payments—to fund the military, to dole out Social Security payments, and more—but the United States does not have the liquidity to afford following through on them. This crisis needs a hard and fast solution to stop the United States from, as World Bank and International Monetary Fund leaders warned, causing “massive disruption the world over.” After Congress solves this short-term problem, however, its members must work hard with the President to come to a long-term solution.
The United States has charted an unsustainable course toward fiscal difficulty. In the future, the country will almost surely prove unable to pay off the interest on its vast debt while simultaneously delivering the entitlement benefits it is obligated to pay citizens under the Social Security and Medicare programs. To navigate these treacherous seas, Congress and the President must work hard to develop a mutually agreeable, lasting fix—one that should and likely will involve both entitlement cutbacks and tax hikes.
This grand bargain, unfortunately, will not come in time to save the United States from defaulting on its debt. The Treasury estimates that it will be unable to continue paying all the government’s bills soon after—if not on—Thursday barring congressional intervention.
Such a default would have far-reaching, categorically negative consequences: First, the United States government will remain shut down, denying federal employees pay and all civilians the services they deserve. Second, the United States would risk a downgrade in its credit rating, raising its borrowing costs substantially. Finally, investors would likely sell off huge amounts of stocks and Treasury bonds, sending a shock throughout the national economy that would likely dwarf the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers. What’s more, the international community regards the United States as one of the world’s most stable investments. As a result, a fiscal meltdown here would decrease business confidence in markets across the globe, dealing countless citizens of countless countries a shattering blow.
These considerations underscore the need for a deal in time to avert an impending fiasco. Republican leadership in Congress have been struggling to muster the votes in their own party for a bill that allows the government to reopen and the United States to handle its debts the winter. This fledgling legislation, however (which all but fell apart Tuesday evening) included politically charged points like denying government health insurance payments to lawmakers and their employees.
But the time for political maneuvering and brinkmanship has passed. The current intransigence of a sizeable part of the Republican caucus is jeopardizing the economic health of our entire nation, and it must end. Congress must push through a measure more that funds the government, extends the debt limit, and requires the development of detailed financial blueprint mapping out decades to come. This type of agreement—close to what is shaping up in the Senate but with any and all politics aside—would postpone our current woes. More importantly, it would also force Congress to secure the United States’ economic future.
A short-term solution to the nation’s current crisis, though necessary, will ultimately amount to no more than a Band-Aid on a bullet hole. It may and must stem the flow of blood for now, but Congress must dive into full-scale surgery to ensure the United States’ good health.

On July 12, 2013, we had front row seats as history was being made. Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani youth advocate who had been shot in the head by the Taliban for daring to speak up for education, stepped onto a podium at the United Nations and declared, “One child, one teacher, one pen, and one book can change the world.” She also announced the beginning of a movement when she said, “they tried to silence me, but they failed. And out of that silence came thousands of voices.”
As leaders of the Youth Advocacy Group for the United Nations Global Education First Initiative, we had helped to organize this U.N. Youth Assembly. We watched with pride as this incredible young woman gave voice to a fact and a dream that we both know too well.  We are a living testimony to the power of education.
Born during devastating civil wars both in Sierra Leone and in Burundi, we experienced first hand the painful feelings of shattering hopes and constantly longed for an opportunity to get an education.  As President Nelson Mandela famously put it, “Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” We often look back at the number of our friends who continue to roam the streets of our countries—a lost generation—one that lost out on education because of war. We have both been lucky. With the education that we have received, we are making our modest contributions to changing the world. And we know that education is the biggest bang for the buck.
From the deep ends of poverty in a refugee camp, one of us, Salathiel, has founded and is currently leading a non-profit organization, YouthGlobe, registered in Burundi and Massachusetts with operations in Korea, that works to inspire young Burundians to work together and creates platforms for the Burundian youth to contribute toward sustainable development in their communities.
Having survived the life of a refugee and grown up in a war torn country, the other co-author, Chernor, has emerged as one of the most influential youth voices in global advocacy and decision-making for education. After founding and leading a non-profit organization in Sierra Leone, he now sits on the U.N. High Level Steering Committee and chairs the Youth Advocacy Group, where he actively represents and promotes youth voices in setting and implementing U.N. high-level policies and programs.
We could have never contributed to our communities’ development, let alone global advocacy for education for all, had we not first been granted access to education ourselves. This is why we are very passionate about being part of and leading this growing movement of young people across the world, challenging current policy and decision makers to provide educational opportunities to youth in vulnerable conditions around the world, especially girls. That is why Malala’s story and her words resonated so powerfully with us.
Luckily, it’s a story that is resonating with millions more around the world. Since the U.N. GEFI Youth Advocacy Group was set up last year, we have been mobilizing young people around the world to stand up for education. Over 500 young people from about 90 countries and 100 organizations were in New York to hear Malala speak and adopt the first Youth Resolution in the history of the UN. Millions of young people from over 80 countries contributed to drafting the resolution. There were over 34 simultaneous events in the world with local youth groups speaking up for education.
As we approach 2015, there are still 57 million children out of school. Each one of them is a broken promise. And led by the incredible Malala, we are privileged to be part of the movement saying that cannot be right. Last week witnessed the International Day of the Girl Child. In that spirit, let us all join hands with Malala and make her dream articulated so poignantly become a reality for all. Indeed, “one child, one book, one pen, can change the world.”
Chernor Bah is the Chairman of the U.N. GEFI Youth Advocacy Group and Youth Representative to the U.N. High Level Steering Committee. Salathiel Ntakirutimana ’16 lives in Currier House. He is the founder and CEO of YouthGlobe and a member of the U.N. GEFI Youth Advocacy Group.

In the summer of 2010, LeBron James announced to the world that he would be joining fellow National Basketball Association stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to play with the Miami Heat. Overnight, James went from being Cleveland’s favorite son, beloved by the media and fans alike, to being one of the most despised players in the league. No one could fathom that he would leave the Cavaliers, let alone announce his decision live on national television, but if we place the events that transpired that summer in a broader, historical context, we see that “The Decision,” as it is has popularly come to be known, was not an act of betrayal.
LeBron James had every right to join the Miami Heat. He honored his contract with the Cavaliers and carried an otherwise mediocre team to the NBA Finals. When the time came to sign a new contract, he did what any other person in his position would have done and used the free agent market to choose a team he felt he would be most successful with. His decision was an expression of freedom and self-determination, qualities that hold high places in our society. Instead of condemning LeBron James, he should be recognized for asserting control over his own destiny and for bringing greater balance to the player-owner relationship in the NBA.
Never before has the sports world seen a professional athlete assert control over his own destiny as visibly as LeBron did. Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert certainly did not see it coming, nor was he prepared to deal with someone other than the “owners” taking ownership in the league. In a strongly worded letter posted on the Cavaliers website shortly after James’ announcement, Gilbert said, “You simply don't deserve this kind of cowardly betrayal… This shocking act of disloyalty from our homegrown ‘chosen one’ sends the exact opposite lesson of what we would want our children to learn. And ‘who’ we would want them to grow-up to become.”
Does asserting control over one’s own destiny really set a bad example for our children? For most of the NBA’s history, players were not allowed to sign with any team following the end of their contracts. Unrestricted free agency has only existed in the NBA since 1996. Before then, NBA owners held exclusive rights to players. If LeBron wanted to play for a different team back in the early 1990s, he would have needed to demand a trade and Dan Gilbert could have just as easily refused to do so. All the power was in the hands of the owners.
Gilbert’s overreaction to LeBron’s decision reminds us that not too long ago, NBA players were expected to be subordinate to the owners. Today, James stands on the shoulders of those professional athletes, such as MLB All-Star Curt Flood, who fought for free agency and greater player autonomy in the past, laying the platform for athletes like James to assert control over their own destinies.
Although black people continue to be underrepresented in positions of power such as the government, non-profit, and corporate sectors due to the lingering effects of institutional racism in this country, professional basketball has emerged as a lucrative profession in which blacks are well represented. However, the owners, coaches, agents, and members of the media continue to be overwhelmingly devoid of color. The league did not have its first black majority owner until Black Entertainment Television founder Robert L. Johnson purchased the Charlotte Bobcats in 2003. Michael Jordan has since purchased that team and remains the only black majority owner in the NBA.
Given this racial dynamic, the fact that LeBron James is black is significant. If LeBron James were not black, it is unlikely that he would have received the same type of backlash for leaving Cleveland. As Jonathen Weiler of the Huffington Post writes, “Superstar black athletes face acute pressure to be perfectly humble…unfailingly cooperative with the media… they must express, at all times, their deep gratitude for the opportunity they’ve been given, even as their owners have license to act as if their own wealth is a divine right.” After The Decision, many members of the media viewed The Decision as an entirely selfish act. There was little discussion about LeBron’s own best interest, because emphasizing the best interest of the black athlete has never been the norm. The league continues to be one that privileges the owner at the expense of the player.
In a society that values individualism and self-fulfillment, LeBron had the courage to assert control over his own career regardless of what anyone else—owners, coaches, agents, media—would have otherwise preferred. In an NBA that has historically restricted the freedoms of players, his decision to take his talents to South Beach represents a bold assertion over one’s own destiny, and that is something that should always be respected.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In April, the Korean pop-star sensation Psy, known for “Gangam Style,” visited Harvard to talk in Memorial Church. He was introduced by a couple of professors. For a while, they talked about globalizing Korean pop culture. The hall, in the meantime, fluctuated between a state of academic-induced sleep and nervous excitement, while the pop-star waited outside.
Just as the restlessness was reaching a peak, the professor called him in. The hall stood. Then it surprisingly fell into a perplexing yet eerie silence. Psy was short and plump but looked just as he did in the videos. Except he had a bewildered look on his face while walking down the long aisle. He was used to applause, I guess.
During the event, I couldn’t stop thinking about that quiet. For a long time, I couldn’t explain it.
But then over the summer, I went to Mongolia. I heard his next song “Gentlemen” blasted at every store front. I saw whole restaurants built after a “Gangam” theme. And now, after months of reflection on the truly global phenomenon, I think I know the reason behind the silence on that spring night in Memorial Church: the audience expected the music to follow him. None of us knew Psy, except for the minutes (in my case, hours) we had seen him on a screen, accompanied by music, words we didn’t know, and images we couldn’t figure out. For some reason, I think we all expected to hear the church blast its organ bass, and he would dance through the aisle, in the ridiculous motion of riding a horse, while we stood to his sides like the stabled horses from the video. But he wasn’t dancing and there was no music. Instead of horses, we all ended up looking like asses.
Psy’s virtual song and video had an impact on our real, physical expectations. It shows that no matter what people think of its substance, “Gangam Style” is powerful. And I think that power actually points to hope for the future—not of music, but of our global culture.
Recently, Billie Joe Armstrong—lead singer of Green Day—called Psy “the herpes of music.” Coming from a guy with a brilliantly subtle taste for satire—for example, his song “American Idiot”—this description is pretty good. Psy is viral. He spreads wherever the internet can take him.
But there is one part of the metaphor I don’t get: I like Psy, and I don’t like herpes. Let me rephrase that. I like Psy, and I don’t think I’d like herpes.
I see what Armstrong is getting at though. Music, after all, is a cultural affair. True maestros put together notes in a harmony of sound. Psy puts together a bunch of dancers, a couple of explosions, and a candid toilet scene in a well-edited sequence.
But unlike Armstrong, the internet values what Psy produced. This can be easily seen through a convenient tool—view counts. The more something is seen online, the more valuable it is. So the question becomes why I and everyone who shared his video—now almost at two billion views—value it so highly.
The answer is easy: The internet likes ridiculousness. And boobs.
On day four of the government shutdown, 550 liked and 212 retweeted an article entitled “Government shutdown: John Boehner to allies: I want a fiscal deal” on Politico. The same day, 79 thousand liked and three thousand retweeted the article “Tea Party Leaders Announce Support For Deal In Exchange For Malia Obama” from the Onion. The second article even got over seven hundred Google Plus(es) or circle-shares or…whatever.
Ridiculousness is why “nut shots” and vines go viral. It’s why Macklemore’s most popular song online is “Thrift Shop” rather than “Same Love” or “Otherside.” It’s why saying you are “feeling fluffy” on Facebook is far less awkward than posting a deeply-aware comment about your recent break up. As strange as it is, the internet values the ridiculous. And boobs.
Psy described it perfectly in his off-the-cuff speech at Harvard. A Berklee graduate, he had the guts to admit it wasn’t the music that allowed him to leap across cultural barriers: “I think it’s fun. The word ‘fun.’ All the people around the world, we like fun,” he said. He tried to cheer up people during the recession in Korea with his music. The result was he made a fun, ridiculous video that was appreciated the world over. It also probably didn’t hurt that he had larger boobs than the average male pop star.
I’ve never really appreciated good music. But I like fun. And on some level, it is comforting to know that much of the world does too. I don’t know what the fox says or what Psy ever says. But as the internet blends cultural divides, at least I know that someone from a country I know very little about also probably enjoys being ridiculous, once in a while.
It’s funny that it took a man in a tux, dancing on a bus, on a boat, on a sidewalk, on a tennis court, on a merry-go-round, on a...walking into Memorial Church, for a few brief, silent moments, for me to realize it. But on the path to unity, the first step is a side-shuffle, with an outwards-thrusted hip and crossed arms, in the Gangnam style. Our new lines of communication can let us have fun together, despite our differences.
Cue music.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than half of over three hundred fee-based, open access science journals accepted a bogus research paper for publication in a study conducted by John N. Bohannon, a visiting scholar at the Harvard Program in Ethics and Health.
After using a computer algorithm to generate 304 versions of a generic scientific paper, each with grave errors, Bohannon submitted 10 a week over the past year to various free-to-view journals. 157 out of the 304 bogus papers were accepted by an open access journal.
Bohannon’s report, which was published in the October 4 issue of the journal Science, described the fake research papers as “a scientific version of Mad Libs.”
Critics of the study were quick to point out that Science, a subscription-based academic journal, might have a bias against its open access competitors.
“He should have taken a random sample of open access journals and subscription journals, a broad spectrum from both business models,” said Lars Bjørnshauge, founder of the Directory of Open Access Journals, a database of quality-controlled open access journals.
Bohannon, however, rejected the notion that his study unfairly targeted open access journals.
“A whole lot of hay has been made about whether Science is out to get open access journals, or has hired out a hit on perceived open access competitors,” Bohannon said. “It’s just so wrong-headed, I don’t even know where to begin.”
In the study, Bohannon targeted 167 journals listed in the Directory, which he called a “‘who’s who’ of credible open access journals.”
Bohannon said he aims to protect open access journals rather than attack them.
“It is by and large a really good thing for science that [the open access business model] exists and that it’s thriving,” Bohannon said. “[It’s] fantastic that you will no longer need to be a member of a rich university to read the scientific research that you paid for with your own tax dollars. I’m completely behind it. Every reasonable science advocate should be behind it.”
Bjørnshauge also argued that Bohannon’s findings exaggerated the influence of sham journals.
“There’s a lot of hype about bogus publishers, but they don’t really have any business,” Bjørnshauge said. “A marginal number of open access journals have problems with peer review. Organizations like the DOAJ, the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association, and others are trying to deal with that.”
According to Bjørnshauge, “all parties are interested in pointing out those publishers and putting them out of business.”
In the weeks since the initial deluge of criticism, Bohannon said his report has brought renewed attention to standards of academic integrity in research publications.
“I’ve been contacted by Indian journalists and they say that they’ve been investigating these guys for years,” Bohannon said. “They’re so happy to have hard evidence in hand now so they can really go after them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Israeli soldier Avner M. Gvaryahu alleged the poor treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli Defense Forces and called for an end to the current occupation of West Bank during a speech at Harvard Hillel Tuesday evening.
Gvaryahu, who served for three years in the West Bank, spoke on behalf of Breaking the Silence, an organization that aims to generate public debate on the costs of military occupation by publicizing the testimonies of soldiers. During his hour-long talk, Gvaryahu drew from the accounts of soldiers compiled by Breaking the Silence in a recently published book, entitled “Our Harsh Logic: Israeli Soldiers’ Testimonies From the Occupied Territories.”
“We want to stop martial law--military presence over millions of people,” said Gvaryahu.
Gvaryahu shared testimonies that described soldiers’ experiences breaking and entering homes in the middle of the night, looting, and engaging in other harmful behavior.
“The first time I met a Palestinian face to face was when I was barging into a house in the middle of the night,” said Gvaryahu.
These military actions were not isolated events, according to Gvaryahu, but rather the experience of most soldiers. Gvaryahu said that these actions were a result of leadership which not only failed to prevent such actions but, at times, promoted them.
“While I served for three years in the West Bank, I slowly realized that there was a huge gap between what my family and friends thought I was asked to do…and what I was asked to do,” said Gvaryahu.
Gvaryahu said that it is this gap in understanding that motivates him and Breaking the Silence to share personal stories in an effort to end the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.
Nicole S. Simon, a doctoral student at the Graduate School of Education who helped organize the event, said that it was her trip to Israel in 2008 that led her to become a supporter of Breaking the Silence and its mission.
“I saw people who looked like me and looked like the community I grew up in behaving in a way that was totally antithetical to the values that our community professed,” Simon said.
“If you care about Israel, you can’t let this go on,” said Joshua B. Lipson ’14, a Crimson editorial writer and president of the J Street U, which co-sponsored the event along with the Progressive Jewish Alliance, Friends of Breaking the Silence, and the New Israel Fund.
Rabbi Jonah C. Steinberg, the executive director of Harvard Hillel, emphasized the need for further discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying, “I hope that people come away from this event proud of [an Israel] in which this discourse is possible.”
“It’s never easy to break a silence,” said Gvaryahu. “We need to keep this discussion on the table."

The majority of students who sought treatment for mental health care at Harvard University Health Services last year felt satisfied with their experience and said they would be willing to recommend their clinician to a friend, according to the results of a patient satisfaction survey released at a UHS-sponsored “Community Conversation” Tuesday night.
The UHS-administered patient satisfaction survey included responses from the approximately 1,000 students who used Mental Health Services in the past year. 74.5 percent of students said their treatment was helpful, 73.8 percent said they would personally recommend their clinician to a friend, and 73 percent reported they would seek treatment again if they found themselves under the same circumstances.
While only 37 percent of students reported receiving an appointment within the first week of making contact with MHS, Chief of Student Mental Health Services Katherine A. Lapierre said improvements have already been made to MHS in response to the mental health portion of the data.
“Today, 75 percent of students get their first appointment within a week. If you’re suffering, you shouldn’t have to wait that long,” Lapierre said.
Some of the changes implemented in the past year, according to Lapierre, include the hiring of an additional psychiatrist, the hiring of an additional therapist, and a reevaluation of the way clinicians manage their caseloads.
In addition to policy changes and increased staffing, Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira announced that students with Harvard-sponsored BlueCross insurance are now eligible for 40 visits to outside clinicians per year. Last year, the number of outpatient visits was capped at 24, and two years ago, the cap stood at 12 visits per year. There is no cap on the number of visits for clinicians at UHS.
Following a presentation of the statistics, students offered their own ideas to improve UHS mental services. These suggestions included direct email communication from UHS and increased visibility of mental health services through posters.
Students thought the event offered an important forum through which to engage with administrators about mental health.
“I thought it was a fantastic beginning to what I hope is an ongoing, sustained discussion,” said Richa Gawande, a mental health advocate and graduate student at the School of Public Health.
The full results of the annual survey will made available on UHS’s website within the coming days, according to Barreira. In addition, UHS plans to co-host a panel on identifying depression in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A study released Tuesday alleges that the management of two Harvard-owned timber plantations in Argentina has led to the deterioration of the Ibera Wetlands, the world’s second largest wetlands, and a decline in the quality of life in surrounding communities.
Since the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s $32.7 billion endowment, acquired the two timber companies in 2007, the plantations have expanded in size, encroaching upon previously protected wildlife and threatening local farms, public health, and road quality, the report claims.
The principal author of the study, Samuel F. Wohns ’14, said that the trees planted in the wetlands soak up a significant amount of water, depleting the supply for farmers and households. As a result, crop yields have fallen and community members have been forced to drill new wells on a continual basis, he said. These changes have been burdensome to local people, many of whom have limited financial means.
“We want the University to immediately halt the expansion of the plantations in Argentina...and to review its current practices and respond to community concerns,” Wohns said.
Wohns said that agrochemical runoff has also polluted the water supply, damaging crops and endangering public health.
The report also contends that the pesticides responsible for the agrochemical runoff were sprayed by workers who reported not having adequate safety gear.
Despite accusations of irresponsible practices, both companies have been audited by sustainable management authorities.
“[Empresas Verdes Argentinas Sociedad Anonima] and Las Misiones successfully obtained the internationally recognized Forest Stewardship Council certification in 2010,” University spokesperson Kevin Galvin wrote in an email. “Las Misiones S.A. underwent an exhaustive audit last month that included interviews with workers, members of the local community and environmentalists, and based on that process we expect that Las Misiones also will receive FSC certification.”
However, audits done by the Forest Stewardship Council suggest that environmentally friendly practices on the Harvard-owned plantations have not been fully implemented and that Harvard has undone some of the sustainable practices put in place by a previous owner.
“These projects are within areas approved for commercial activities and have been managed diligently to ensure that they are in compliance with, or exceeding, all applicable rules and regulations in order to minimize impact to the wetlands,” Galvin wrote.
Members of communities surrounding the wetlands penned a letter to University President Drew G. Faust summarizing their grievances. Wohns will deliver the letter to Faust’s office on Friday afternoon, along with other members of Responsible Investment at Harvard.
The report was published by the Oakland Institute, a California think tank, and the Responsible Investment at Harvard Coalition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Part I of a three-part series on the search for a new Dean of the College. Part II ran on Oct. 17 and Part III ran on Oct. 18.
Within the next year, the man or woman whom Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith names as the 19th Dean of Harvard College will take charge of 6,700 undergraduates and a host of employees and administrators. But despite the breadth of this charge, the new Dean will find that many of the aspects of University life most relevant to the student body do not fall directly under his or her control.
Admissions and financial aid, along with all undergraduate athletics, are overseen by other deans in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, while dining services and University health services—including mental health services—report to administrators who are even higher up in the University’s administrative hierarchy.
As a mid-level administrator within the University, the Dean of the College works as an intermediary between top University brass and subordinate College deans, rarely acting unilaterally. Most important decisions about the College require approval from the FAS Dean, while many smaller decisions are made by the College Dean’s administrative staff—restricting the range of decisions that the College Dean can make directly.
Yet administrators say the Dean of the College is not powerless. Working within the constraints of a limited position, they say, the Dean can impact the lives of undergraduates by laying out a vision for administrative priorities, convening task forces to make recommendations about particular issues, and advocating for the College in front of University superiors.
AN INDIRECT DECISION-MAKER
In University Hall, the home of both College and FAS administrators, office layout mirrors administrative hierarchy—the Office of the Dean of FAS is on the second floor, above the first floor office of the Dean of the College.
Because the College operates within the Faculty of the Arts and Sciences, the College’s chief executive reports directly to the FAS Dean, who in turn reports to the University President. Accordingly, when high-level, College-wide decisions have to be made, they often either require the FAS Dean’s approval or are put to a faculty vote.
“The Dean of the College would never make a decision without consulting Mike Smith, if it’s important,” said Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde, who works under the Dean of the College.
Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister, who has said he will fill the role for no more than a year, said he consults with Smith about nearly all dimensions of his work, including the offices and departments that pertain solely to undergraduates.
And the College Dean doesn’t just consult with his or her superior—in fact, administrators said, decisions are typically made in consultation with a cabinet comprised of subordinate College deans. The cabinet, which includes administrators such as Lassonde and Administrative Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison, assesses a given problem and offers recommendations, often based on consensus.
“Unlike the corporate world, this is a lot more fluid,” said Ellison, moments after a quick knock on his University Hall office door from Pfister. “We are a bunch of academics at heart, and most academics like to talk and consult before we make decisions.”
But in a system that prides itself on consultation, the College Dean often does not take a direct role in final decision-making.
“We make decisions everyday that aren’t College-wide decisions—that are just within our own unit—and he doesn’t need to get involved,” Ellison said, citing intra-unit hiring as an example of something he would try to avoid “bothering” Pfister with.
Yet between the high-level decisions made by Smith and the smaller intra-unit decisions made by College administrators, the Dean of the College retains influence among the decision-makers.
“It wouldn’t feel very collegial to me if the Dean of the College looks at a proposal and says ‘No, this can’t make the list,’ and I still try to get it to Dean Smith,” said another Cabinet member, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “I would not give up on it all together, but I would take it off for that year.”
BUDGET BINDS
The allocation of funds for the College reflects the Dean’s place within the University decision making and the web of consultation that it entails.The Dean of the College plays an active but limited role in budgetary decisions that are often finalized by administrators in FAS.
“Overall, budget discussions would take place with [the FAS Dean] because the College budget is nestled within the budget of FAS,” Pfister said, noting that while the Dean of the College has some influence in the apportionment of the funds within the College, final approval on larger allocations comes from finance officers within FAS.
Dingman similarly said that when the Freshman Dean’s Office solicits funding from the Dean of the College for a new project, some of the requests get “moved upstairs,” where FAS ultimately makes the decision.
In preparing the overall budget that will ultimately be approved by the FAS Dean, the College Dean’s primary role is to examine the budgets compiled by the College’s various deans and offices.
“Everybody always needs more than what is available, so there’s a period of reconciliation of the requests with the likely amount of budget that we have in use,” Pfister said. “It’s an iterative process; it’s back and forth.”
In addition, the Dean of the College has access to “discretionary funds,” though Pfister said that these monies are not extensive or flexible. “So far as I see it, much of it has already been committed in various directions,” he said.
Other requests, normally those requiring small amounts of funding, may also be personally approved by the Dean of the College, but Dingman said these types of budgetary decisions are rare. He named funding for freshman landscaping projects as an example of a budgetary decision about which the College Dean has complete discretion.
“We didn’t have the money to buy plants, and we went to [former Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds] and said ‘If you think this is worthy, can you support it?’” Dingman said. “She thought it was a great idea and was able to find the money to help us.”
SETTING THE AGENDA
Although the College Dean’s executive power may be limited, administrators said the Dean holds enough sway to effect change.
“Just because you don’t have a lot of budgetary authority doesn’t mean you can’t influence decisions,” said former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis, who served as dean between 1995 and 2003. Lewis added that he believes a major part of the College Dean’s role is to provide subordinate administrators with a sense of direction.
Several other administrators agreed that the Dean of the College can use his or her influence to set an agenda for other deans who directly interact with students.
“I think the dean needs to lay out a vision for the College and help people to understand what the key priorities are in a year,” Dingman said. “Those can then help all of us organize our own efforts.”
And even though it might ultimately be up to other administrators to implement the Dean’s vision, they do have deference for it. Outside of the College Dean’s cabinet of advisors, Dingman said, the Dean’s opinions are heavily acknowledged and respected in University Hall. In particular, he added, the College Dean acts as a “champion” for the College within FAS.
In many cases, the Dean’s advocacy on behalf of the College takes the shape of “working groups” or “task forces” that charge groups of faculty and administrators with investigating particular issues, according to longtime Adams House resident dean Sharon Howell.
“The power of the dean is to say ‘I’d like you, you, and you to come in and talk about this, and think about what to do about it, and make recommendations to me, and I will make a decision about what we’re going to do going forward,’” said Howell, citing Hammonds’s Working Group on Student Stress as an example.
Administrators said that throughout her five-year tenure, Hammonds was known to be passionate about inclusion and wanted to ensure that all students felt like part of the community. In fall 2010, she convened a working group to study the experiences and needs of members of the bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, and queer community at Harvard. That working group recommended the establishment of a BGLTQ campus space and the hiring of a full-time staff person to lead it—recommendations that translated into the now year-and-a-half-old Office of BGLTQ Student Life and the director position held by Vanidy “Van” Bailey.
Administrators said that in this way, the College’s priorities can be shaped by the characteristics of the individuals holding the deanship at the time.
As Howell put it, the College Dean’s power “doesn’t necessarily always involve expenditures, but it does involve shifting culture, shifting policy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard men’s soccer team was victorious in an Ivy League contest, Ross Friedman was a freshman.
The senior defender’s streak came to an abrupt halt at Berman Field this weekend when the Crimson earned a 2-1 victory in double overtime against Cornell.
“I’m super proud of the guys,” said Friedman following Saturday’s win. “It feels unbelievable. We were just absolutely ecstatic, and hopefully we can bring that momentum to the rest of Ivy League play.”
In the victory over the Big Red, Friedman had his best performance of the season. Midway through the opening period, he put Harvard on the board with his first goal of the year. After receiving a feed from senior forward A.J. Agha at the edge of the box, Friedman settled the ball with his chest and drove a low shot past the keeper to give the Crimson an early lead.
“I brought it down and struck it as quick as possible because the defender was coming,” Friedman said. “Something we’ve been focusing on is keeping shots on target, so I was really ecstatic that I could get it on target. It was a great moment, and I think we had a lot of momentum after that play.”
Though Friedman scored early in the game, his work had only just begun.
After the Big Red came back with a goal of its own as the clock wound down, it would take another big play from the senior to secure the victory for Harvard.
Less than two minutes into the second overtime period, Friedman stepped up to take a free kick deep in Cornell territory. He sent the ball flying into the box, and fellow senior Kevin Harrington directed it past the Big Red keeper with his head, giving the Crimson a 2-1 victory.
“We were gone from there,” Friedman said. “We were celebrating. It was an unbelievable feeling.”
Saturday’s win was a drastic turnaround from last weekend’s 2-1 defeat against Yale in which Harvard surrendered two late goals in the final minutes of regulation.
Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer pointed to the leadership of Friedman, as well as seniors Harrington and Kyle Henderson, as one of the main reasons behind the ability of the team to bounce back.
“It’s such a confident group that players like Kevin and Ross and Kyle are talking to the group saying we just have to make adjustments and get going and keep moving, and they were just very positive,” Lehrer said. “That’s just great leadership from the group. That’s why they persevered in this last game.”
Friedman seized the attention of the league with his performance against Cornell, earning him Ivy League Player of the Week honors. He is the first Harvard player to earn this title since Tim Linden on November 15, 2010. Linden earned the honor after a similar double-overtime victory on the road against Penn.
The win over Penn had been the last time that Harvard won a conference game before the Crimson pulled off the upset against the Big Red on Saturday.
Through the first ten games of the season, Friedman has notched one goal and five assists. He sits atop the Ancient Eight in assists, and he is ninth in the league in points with seven.
“Ross has been great,” Lehrer said. “He can play multiple positions for us, which is really a unique skill set. He’s been great in the locker room, [and] he constantly works to improve. Players love him. The staff loves him. He’s huge in the leadership of the group.”
In his career beyond Harvard, Friedman has been no stranger to winning. This past summer, Friedman represented the United States at the Maccabiah Games in Israel. He made his presence felt by scoring a penalty kick in the shootout of the championship game, helping Team USA earn the gold medal.
“That was an unbelievable experience, probably one of the soccer experiences that I will remember from the sport looking back on soccer when I’m done,” Friedman said. “Those guys are like brothers to me.”
Since returning from Israel in time for his senior season, Friedman has been an integral part of the Crimson’s recent success.
“You don’t really find players like [Ross] really often,” Lehrer said. “He’s got a great work ethic on and off the field, improving his teammates, improving himself, improving meetings, everything. He’s very, very valuable to the team.”
Friedman’s success can be largely attributed to the support he has received from one fan in particular.  Although he resides in Ohio, 800 miles away from campus, Tod Friedman has attended nearly every one of his son’s games for the past four years.
“He meets us out in California, he meets us out in New Mexico, he’ll meet us anywhere, and he’ll do whatever it takes to be at our games,” said Friedman. “He loves it, and I love having him with me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a slow start, the Harvard women’s soccer team is tearing through its remaining opponents.
The Crimson began its season with three losses in a row. The first came to the University of California at San Fransisco and the second to the University of San Fransisco. The Harvard women’s soccer team fell for a third consecutive time back on the East Coast against the University of New Hampshire with an ending score of 2-1.
“The results that we had didn’t really deter our motivation at all,” junior Marie Margolius said. “We felt like we were playing good soccer, and that was enough for us to not get discouraged.”
Margolius described the Crimson’s approach to the pre-season as a learning experience.
“We really just focused on getting to know each other,” she said. “We have a lot of new girls this year, so a lot of what we did was just learning how to play with each other and learning other people’s habits and strengths.”
Junior midfielder Laura Aguilar commented on the fact that Ivy-League pre-seasons tend to start later than many of the other preseasons of schools outside of the conference.
“With the Ivy League rules, we have to start a little bit later than most of the teams that we play, so Cal, USF, UNH all had a few games under their belts before we played them,” Aguilar said.
The Harvard women knew what they had to do to squash what had become an unfavorable pattern.
“I think it was just us, working out the kinks, trying to figure out how to play well together,” Aguilar said. “That just takes time and comes with experience.”
The Crimson jumped at the chance to prove themselves at home against Providence College on September 13th. Fighting through a double-overtime to a tie of 1-1, Harvard broke its stream of losses.
“We were very hungry to win and be successful,” Aguilar said. “We’d been playing very well, and the scores of the first few games didn’t necessarily reflect how well we were playing.”
The squad was determined to show how good they were on the scoreboard.
“Once we were able to get our nerves out of the way and figure out how to play with each other we were able to get that competitive edge and get that fight,” Aguilar said.
Two days after, the Crimson hosted LIU Brooklyn and prevailed with a single goal. The final score read, 1-0.
“Honestly we just kept doing what we had been doing before,” Margolius said. “We have a really good team, a lot of talent, and a lot of heart, and I think our focus has always been just playing good soccer. Our attitudes have been the same the whole time.”
Improving once again, the team shutout the University of Rhode Island, 2-0, at home. Just two days later, the Crimson triumphed over UMass Lowell with a score of 5-0.
“UMass Lowell was a whole team effort,” Aguilar said. “A bunch of different people scored, a bunch of different people assisted, and we were just able to put the pieces together and have fun.”
The team recorded its first Ivy League victory on September 27 when it hosted Penn.
“We came out very excited to play Penn and ready for the challenge,” Aguilar said. “We were just ready to go, so to get a win was very exciting.”
Since then, the Harvard team has remained strong, beating Central Connecticut State 2-0, Yale 3-1, and playing Boston University to a tie of 1-1.
Margolius attributes these successes to strong team performances in practices.
“We’re just training good habits in practice, and I think it really carries over into the game,” she said.
Most recently, the Crimson beat Cornell 7-2. And while the conference wins are important to the team, non-conference games carry weight as well.
“We treat every Ivy League game as a championship game,” Aguilar said.
This week, the team gets ready to play the Bears at Ohiri Field.
“Each Ivy League game is a new and different game, so we have to put our whims behind us and move on to the next challenge,” Aguilar said.  “Improving our speed of play and possession of the ball—those are the things we’re focusing on.”
Margolius stated that the Crimson is not focusing as much on finding ways to combat Brown’s specific tactics.
“There’s no commentary between us about what they are doing,” Margolius said. “We’re just focusing on ourselves.”
The Harvard women’s soccer team will battle it out against Brown on Saturday at 4pm at Soldier’s Field.

So you’ve reached a classic dilemma. It’s time to update your Facebook profile picture, and you don’t know which to choose. We all like to pretend that we change our profile pictures with no deep thought, but really, be honest with yourself. Every picture you’ve ever chosen is trying to send a subtle message about who you’d like the world to think you truly are. Harvard students, you’re probably guilty of at least one of the following—take a look.
The “look what I did last summer!” picA classic choice for Harvard upperclassmen, this photo is characterized by a breathtakingly beautiful background, the presence of an influential professor or business professional, and you—dressed in a suit, lab coat, or outdoor hiking gear. You know you’re dying to talk about how you cured cancer or discovered the tomb of an ancient Egyptian prince, but you’re afraid to bring it up unless someone asks—hopefully, posting it as your profile picture will draw attention to it and make people ask about it, right? Right?
The group picYou’ve posted a profile picture with so many people in it that even you have trouble picking out your own face. Did you post it because you think people will see your true personality and love of your activities shining through? Or did you just want to show everyone back home, including your mom, that you really have made friends here and wanting to Skype home all the time is not, in fact, out of the crushing loneliness you feel when you’re staying in on a Saturday because you “just didn’t feel like going out?”
The artsy picYou’ve seen them before, you know what they look like. You’re outside with a book and a glass of refreshing unsweetened iced tea (which everyone knows actually tastes like grass), reading in the sun-dappled grass as you say goodbye to the last remaining days of summer. You don’t look at the camera, pretending it was an accident and that a friend took it for you, but you’ve actually meticulously constructed the entire thing. Right down to the choice of book that says, “I go to Harvard but I know how to let my hair down with a little light reading”—like "A Brief History of Time." You took multiple shots to get it just right but post it with a caption letting us all know that it was a happy accident and you actually are this artsy in real life.
The “oh this picture is so embarrassing but my friend made me put it up” picYou put in a caption saying something like “this is for you, roomie… thanks.” when in all reality you know you look damn good in this picture despite your funny expression and insistence that you don’t. Don’t try to fool us.
The classic “I can’t believe I go to Harvard!” picTypically seen among incoming freshmen, though upperclassmen can be just as guilty, this is the stereotypical pic of you standing in the Yard next to one of the beautiful brick buildings casually wearing your Harvard swag. The camera is angled perfectly so as to catch the rays of light streaming through the trees, because you want everyone to know how much you appreciate the simple beauty of your college. Classic humble brag.
The party/date event picYou pick it because it’s a nice photo of you smiling with some friends or a cute date—or so you’d like us to think. But actually, you’ve picked it because it’s clear from the background that you’re attending a formal event for the Fox, and you want us all to know you were on the list.
The “I have school spirit!” picYou post a picture of yourself at a sporting event, all decked out and cheering on the Crimson with your buddies. You want us to know you support your school and that you have fun going to sporting events. Give it up, man. We all know that’s the only game you’ve ever been to besides Harvard-Yale, and it wasn’t even fun because only 20 people showed up and they all left after halftime. We appreciate your effort, but anyone who knows anything about Harvard can see through that façade.
The laughing/funny face picWe get it. You want to show everyone that you’re having fun at college and that Harvard isn’t the endlessly work-filled, soul-crushing place it’s made out to be. Too bad you didn’t take any photos of yourself during the other 99.9% of your time here, which is spent crying over your CS50 pset that just won’t work because you misplaced one stupid semicolon.
Another week, another installment of the latest and greatest in college admissions news. Spoiler alert: nude selfies + college apps = bad.
U BELONG WITH ME. Are you a low-income student with high academic potential who wants to go to college? The Atlantic has decreed that you’re more likely to if you take the ACT (because it offers four free score reports). Or if you live in Syracuse.
A.P.T. KIDS GET INTO COLLEGE. Jokes, this guy thinks all you need to get into college is to be “APT”—Already Professional & Tenacious. His foolproof method: “work hard; play hard; eschew frivolities.” That would probaby go nicely on a decorative pillow.
COMMON APP FAQ. Confused about the new Common Application? College admissions commentator Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz has got you covered. Did you know you get 47 characters per line in the activities section? We didn't.
RANKINGS AGAIN? REALLY? Exciting news for U.S. News & World Report—kids actually pay attention to its rankings, according to a new study that shows that a college’s improvements on the U.S. News rankings increase student applications to that school.
WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY? That’s what Tufts wants to know about its applicants, according to this smart article. Why do college apps expect 17 year olds to have answers for deep life questions? Oh, and by the way, that advice about just “being yourself” apparently is a lie.
INTERNET SAFETY. Hey all, the Swampscott Reporter has big news: Don’t go all Miley Cyrus on your Instagram if you want to get accepted to college. And though it may be “less-than-obvious,” do not expect an acceptance from a college if you’ve posted on Facebook that it’s your “safety school.”
WRITE RIGHT. For those of you who feel like you botched the SAT essay section this weekend, never fear: Slate says the SAT essay teaches bad writing anyway.
THE BRITISH ARE COMING. The New York Times reports that nowadays, British interest in U.S. colleges may rival fanaticism over the new iPhone. If you are reading this and happen to be British, we on the Admissions Blog News Team would like to welcome you and your divine accents.
