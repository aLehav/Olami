After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York City, the perennial muse of the American dream, has inspired yet another paean, the musical “In the Heights,” now playing at the Boston Opera House through January 24th. “In the Heights” is reminiscent of other musicals about New York, resembling a cross between “Rent” and “West Side Story.” It takes a cross-sectional look at the intersecting lives of Latino immigrants and their children living in Washington Heights, aspiring to that most nebulous and elusive of entities: the American dream.
The adult characters of “In the Heights” came to New York with the desire to make life better for their children. Undaunted exuberance and strength in the face of disaster are the name of the game as the play reaffirms American confidence and belief in success and social mobility in the face of crushing poverty, despite the nation’s current bleak economic situation.
Even though the American dream is now generations old, “In the Heights” is emphatically contemporary. The musical genre is ostensibly hip-hop, but utilizes a variety of genres. The central character, Usnavi (Kyle Beltran), generally raps his longer monologues and soliloquies, and the cast dances to hip-hop, salsa, and whatever else suits the musical mood. At times there are touches of Paul Simon in the music, and in the dancing, moments of ballet.
There is also a fair amount of urban angst, represented by the dancing of Graffiti Pete (Jose-Luis Lopez), who does not appear often enough considering his talent. The stage itself seems almost too small to contain the enthusiasm of the characters and the excellent choreography by Andy Blankenbuehler. The movements of the ensemble cast, even the most minor characters, are carefully orchestrated.
It is this precision and attention given to every detail that makes each moment purposeful and meaningful in the production. These details give “In the Heights” a sense of being a living city, complete with the innumerable intersecting lives and storylines of the actual New York.
Every story in the neighborhood of “In the Heights” is connected, but the plot focuses particularly on the lives of Usnavi and Nina (Arielle Jacobs). These two characters represent the hopes of the next generation. Success is defined as winning the lottery or graduating from Stanford, two things which are actually not as wildly different as they appear.
Usnavi, who owns a corner store that sells lottery tickets, hands out his own form of hope to the inhabitants of the Heights every day. Beltran himself is tall and skinny, and can contort his dancer’s body into a perfect gangly imitation of a typical class clown. When he dances, his lanky frame whips gracefully through the throngs of dancers with intense energy and verve.
Nina, the sweet and modest neighborhood prodigy, won a scholarship to Stanford. Yet Nina is torn between the many stresses of her school environment, exacerbated by the hope that her parents and the rest of the neighborhood have in her. The contrast between Beltran’s joie de vivre and Jacobs’ defeated posture when she sings by herself in the spotlight is particularly striking.
Though the individuals of the show are captivating by themselves, it is their place among the rest of the community that gives “In the Heights” its depth.  The show’s competing voices blend beautifully into a wonderful and exciting production.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a surprising upset, Republican State Senator Scott P. Brown was elected yesterday to fill the United States Senate seat formerly held by liberal Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, making Brown the first Republican Senator from Massachusetts in 30 years.
Brown defeated Democrat and Mass. Attorney General Martha M. Coakley, receiving 52 percent of the vote in the special election to replace Kennedy, who passed away last August.
While Coakley was an early front-runner in the polls, Brown tapped into residents’ discontent with the economy and frustration with the Democrats’ leadership in Washington.
“[Coakley’s] more of the same old politics in Washington,” said Mass. voter Lindsay D. Bauer. “I think [Brown] will help start to lead the nation in the direction that it should be going.”
Brown’s victory strips the Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate and reins in their ability to pass legislation overhauling the country’s health care system—a long-time goal of the late Senator Kennedy. Brown made his opposition to health care reform and his ability to hinder the bill one of the hallmarks of his campaign.
The passage of the health care bill is a top priority for President Barack Obama, who traveled to Boston last Sunday to campaign on behalf of Coakley.
“There is a lot at stake in this election for Obama" said Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo, a government department lecturer and Dunster House resident dean. "A big part of his first-year legacy is riding on health-care."
The close race between Brown and Coakley led to a high turnout in the polls. Overall, Massachusetts had a 54 percent turnout rate, with 54 percent of eligible Cambridge voters casting their ballot in the special election.
“The reason why we have such a high turnout is because a fair amount of Democrats realized that just by not paying attention we could let a Senator that doesn’t represent Massachusetts well slide into the Senate seat,” said Cambridge voter Fabio Idrobo.
Members of the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club had been making phone calls over the past week to try to get out the vote, according to Dems President Jason Q. Berkenfeld ’11 and HRC President Mark A. Isaacson ’11.
Berkenfeld said that Coakley’s loss is a message to Democrats that “if we want change…we need to keep working.”
“Brown's victory is a warning shot to all Democrats running in 2010,” Isaacson said, “because if an underdog Republican candidate can win a decisive victory in the bluest of blue states, no Democrat is safe.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were five things Adams House Master Judith S. Palfrey '67 said she was told to remember before carrying the 2010 Olympic Flame across a 300-yard stretch in Calgary, Canada on Tuesday morning. The first three were simple: smile, smile, and smile.
"After that, we were told to be sure to really take in the moment and enjoy it," Palfrey said Tuesday in a phone interview. "Carrying the torch is something that you're doing for other people, and it's something that few others will ever have the opportunity to do."
Palfrey stood in a local elementary school awaiting further instructions with the men and women chosen to carry the torch on Day 82 of the relay, which will last for 106 days as the Olympic Flame makes its way across Canada to Vancouver for the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in February. According to Palfrey, the torch is engraved with a maple leaf that must be turned towards the runner's heart during the relay.
Palfrey, a Harvard Medical School professor, was named one of 20 torchbearers chosen by the Coca-Cola Company for her work to improve the quality of healthcare for children as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The money raised during her run will go toward relief efforts in Haiti conducted by AAP affiliates, she said. Over the past few days, Palfrey said, her colleagues have been sending supplies and medical personnel to Haiti through the Dominican Republic.
At 10:10 a.m. on Tuesday, Palfrey took the Olympic Torch from Canadian athlete Chris Avelar and jogged 300 yards before hip-bumping and passing the flame to Speed Skating Canada's Hall of Fame inductee Debra Fisher four minutes later. Palfrey joins over 100 torchbearers transporting the torch through several cities in Alberta on Tuesday's leg of the relay.
"There really is something indescribable about seeing the flame in person," said Palfrey, who arrived in Calgary, the site of the 1988 Winter Games, Monday afternoon. "While I was carrying it, I kept looking up at it because it was amazing to be able to hold it in my hand."
Clad in white suiting, Palfrey, the fifty-sixth runner of the day, was cheered on by her husband, John G. "Sean" Palfrey '67, their daughter, Katy Palfrey, and friends as she jogged through the streets of Calgary. As she rounded the corner, she was surprised to see a crowd of schoolchildren greeting her enthusiastically.
"Someone must have told them my name, because as I turned the corner they kept shouting out, 'Judy! Judy!'" Palfrey said. "That was beautiful."
Palfrey returned to Cambridge Wednesday evening to continue Haitian relief efforts through AAP sister organizations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Erich W. Segal ’58, classics scholar and popular writer of works like “Love Story,” died Sunday from a heart attack at his home in London. Segal, who had been battling Parkinson’s disease for over 20 years, was 72.
Respected in the realms of both academia and popular culture, Segal was a man who worked both inside and outside of the proverbial ivory tower. Having produced several acclaimed scholarly works on Greek and Roman literature over the course of his academic career, Segal also wrote bestselling novels and screenplays for popular films, including the script for the 1968 animated Beatles feature “Yellow Submarine.”
Upon graduating as the class of 1958’s Latin salutatorian and class poet, Segal remained at Harvard to earn both a Master’s degree and a Ph.D. in comparative literature. He later taught classics at several other Ivy League institutions, and, after teaching classics at Yale from the 1960s through the 1980s, became an honorary fellow at Oxford University’s Wolfson College.
But despite the critical acclaim garnered by his scholarly work, such as “The Death of Comedy,” Segal is perhaps best known for his contributions to popular culture—specifically the 1970 romantic drama “Love Story.”
In 1961, Segal wrote a musical called “Sing Muse!”—a spoof of the Iliad that explores, according to a review in The Crimson from May 1961, how “Paris made it with Helen (or vice versa).” The show was originally performed in Leverett House dining hall and was ultimately picked up by an off-Broadway producer.
“I was up here getting a Ph.D. And I wrote something for Leverett House ’cause they wanted it for spring weekend, see?” Segal had told The Crimson in 1972. “But the professionals bought it and put it on. And then by God, I was a professional!”
But Segal reached the height of fame as a professional writer with “Love Story.” Originally conceived as a screenplay, “Love Story” first appeared in novel form and enjoyed a lengthy presence on The New York Times bestseller list, selling millions of copies. The 1970 film version, starring Ryan O’Neal and Ali MacGraw, grossed almost $200 million and has been said to have rescued then-struggling Paramount Pictures from financial collapse.
Written while Segal was on leave from Yale in the late 1960s, the story follows the budding relationship between preppy Harvard student Oliver Barrett IV and working-class Radcliffe student Jennifer Cavilleri, who dies not long after their marriage.
A resident of Dunster House at the time, Segal admitted to using at least two students he had met in the house as models for the story’s protagonist: former Vice President Al Gore ’69 and actor Tommy Lee Jones ’69, roommates who lived near Segal.
Jones—the athlete with the heart of gold—provided a bulk of the inspiration for Oliver’s personality, while Gore’s relationship with his father, Senator Albert Gore, parlayed into Oliver’s difficulties with his own domineering father, according to statements Segal made in the 1990s, when Americans began to wonder whether Oliver Barrett IV was an alter-ego of Gore.
While Segal authored numerous other scholarly and fictional titles, among other accomplishments, the line that concludes “Love Story”—”Love means never having to say you’re sorry”—has decidedly written his name onto the annals of popular culture.
Segal is survived by his wife, Karen James, and his two daughters.

It’s official! Flat Patties will be pulling out of The Garage and moving to its own place at 33 Brattle Street (by Crema Café).
The burger joint was granted its new license after a final hearing Tuesday night and will soon begin its move into the space previously occupied by Calliope, a children’s clothing store, which closed last summer.
The transition will take two to three months to complete. Because Flat Patties filed its paperwork for the new location only last month, no businesses have yet signed on to take its place in The Garage.
Flat Patties owner Tom Brush said that he’s excited about the new location and the flexibility it offers. In the new space, he added, customers will be able to enjoy a warmer decor and outdoor seating. There will also be a few menu tweaks, although Flat Patties food will still be prepared from scratch—with its burgers still freshly ground every day.
We too are looking forward to the new taste and feel. Too bad we'll have to wait until after Spring Break.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient Eight (and some other schools too).
Dudes masturbate more than girls?  Who would have thought? Apparently, this universally acknowledged  truth (at least, we assumed, among most humans over the age of 12) is news at Princeton.
Recently, The Daily  Princetonian released the results of its sex survey, which explored various aspects of sexual health at Princeton. The survey itself, which yielded an interesting set of statistics and this article about emergency contraceptive use on campus, seems pretty legit. But then there's this article, entitled "Pleasuring Princeton,” which discusses the prevalence of masturbation on campus.
Here’s the gist of  this wonderful exercise in statistical exploration: “Male undergraduates  are much more likely to masturbate than their female peers, according  to a recent survey on undergraduate sexual activity conducted by The  Daily Princetonian.” Groundbreaking, no? Also, the article quoted  a UCLA psychology professor who explains that these “gender discrepancies”  might stem in part from male genitals being “a lot more easy to find”  than their female counterparts.
In other news, Christie’s auction house in New York has pulled from its upcoming auction  a human skull that previously had been used as a ballot box for Yale’s  famously secretive Skull and Bones society. Apparently, there was a title claim issue. Either that or  someone finally woke up and realized that no one would pay $10,000-$20,000  for a nasty piece of human remains.
On a more serious note, at  Notre Dame, The Observer printed a cartoon on Jan. 13 that many considered offensive to the LGBT community. The comic strip has since been discontinued, and Observer Assistant Managing Editor Kara King, who said she takes responsibility for allowing it to run, resigned  Jan. 17 in a letter to the Notre Dame community.
Earlier this month, someone  in China hacked into the Google account of a Stanford student  named Tenzin  Seldon, a known  Tibetan activist. Whether or not Google decides to stay in China, the fact that these hackings have targeted people like Seldon—a student at  an American university—has generated some unease in Washington, where the Obama administration has reiterated its concerns about international computer security and the possibility of further  attacks on larger corporations.
