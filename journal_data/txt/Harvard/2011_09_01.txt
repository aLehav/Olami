After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Thousands of citizens gather at a rally to invoke religious beliefs, sing the national anthem, and decry a government they mistrust. No, this is not the Tea Party circa the 2010 midterm elections season. It is New Delhi in summer 2011, and the drink of choice is not tea, but chai.
Indeed, in the past year, these two very different democracies have given birth to eerily similar movements. In the United States, the Tea Party’s mission, according to leader Mark Meckler, is to “attract, educate, organize, and mobilize” citizens to restore “fiscal responsibility and constitutionally limited government.” It is to minimize the size and scope of government.
In India, this summer has seen the rise of a grassroots anti-corruption movement, striving for the implementation of a Jan Lokpal, or “citizens’ ombudsman” committee, to investigate government corruption and excessive bureaucracy. Both factions rely on grassroots populism and radical rhetoric. Extreme Tea Partyists have compared President Obama to Hitler, while Indian leader Anna Hazare has demanded the death penalty, as the maximum punishment, for corrupt politicians. Tea Party ideologists hearken back to the so-called “glory days” of the American Revolution, comparing themselves to colonists and idolizing the Constitution. Likewise, Indian anti-corruption supporters frame their cause as an echo of their nation’s 20th century fight for independence from British rule, utilizing hunger strikes as a form of peaceful protest and donning white hats called the “Gandhi topi” in allusion to India’s foremost revolutionary.
These movements are alike not only in philosophy, but in terms of the people who champion them. Mainstream politicians spearhead neither political faction. India’s answer to Tea Party leaders like Rick Perry (who organized an evangelist prayer rally to “halt America’s national decline” last month) and Michelle Bachmann (a self-described Constitutional purist) are Baba Ramdev, a spiritual figurehead, and Anna Hazare, a 74-year-old military veteran and social activist. More importantly, the devotees of both so-called grassroots movements are citizens who perceive and portray themselves as ordinary and disenfranchised, be they rural, blue collar Americans or urban, middle class Indians.
There is no doubt that these movements have much in common, but less clear are the long-term consequences of radical reformism in each country. Indian Express columnist Dilip Bobb opines that in the South Asian anti-corruption movement, “there is a hidden danger: a challenge to the established instruments and norms of parliamentary democracy.” However, in India, parliamentary democracy does not function all that efficiently to begin with. In the 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, which scores countries from zero to 10, zero being the most corrupt and 10 the least, India scored a 3.3 , tying with the smaller, slower growing economies of Jamaica and Liberia. Bribing your way into a legislative seat remains the common form of election in rural India. Last year, the nation generated nearly $700 billion in tax revenue, but the federal government only plans to invest $100 billion annually in building much-needed infrastructure over the next five years. Anna Hazare’s supporters will concur that corruption is, indeed, the norm in Indian government. As such, the Lokpal bill and its advocates run little danger of trying to fix a system that isn’t broken. Should the movement’s devotees continue to focus on the singular, specific goal of decreasing corruption and see through the effective implementation of their proposed federal watchdog committee, the results could be beneficial for India, whose government needs to catch up with its economically empowered and intellectually sincere population.
For America, on the other hand, the Tea Party’s revolutionary rhetoric is proving far more detrimental, as evidenced by a worsening economy under the stalemate of a Democratic president versus unyielding Tea Party influence in the House. Despite the Tea Party’s wolf cries of dysfunctional government, American government is relatively less corrupt than that of India or most developing countries. Moreover, the United States is a developed nation. Its most pressing conflict is not government corruption, but the more complicated challenge of facing economic instability, even as it retains its position as the world’s largest economy. As proven by this summer’s Congressional debt ceiling agreement that sent the global stock market into turbulence, the U.S. government and economy are interdependent. Therefore, at this time of economic instability, American politicians would do well to find solutions within the system, not rebuild it.
Despite their varying consequences, the movements signal parallel, populist shifts in the political climates of the two nations. Indians and Americans are kicking and screaming their way into government policymaking, and framing their cause as a battle to force the government to better serve its citizens. These grassroots advocates perceive the current system of governance as an enemy, and although this sentiment is divisive, it may open the door for important government reform in both countries. For better or worse, the unstoppable force of democracy is at work. Power to the people—until they become no good, corrupt, inhuman politicians, anyway.

Texas Governor Rick Perry has a problem.
You see, since becoming the newly-minted national frontrunner for the Republican nomination for president in 2012, he now finds himself standing in a red jumpsuit before four bad-tempered bulls: his rivals in the Republican field, the Republican establishment, the national mainstream media, and the Obama White House. Compounding his woes is the fact that he faces these foes with a hefty albatross around his neck: He is a white man.
In 2008, one of then-candidate Obama’s greatest electoral assets was the history-making nature of his campaign to become the first rich, Ivy League-educated, Protestant, male president who also happened to black. This cycle too promises to be historic, as we have Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann vying to become the first truly fringe president, Georgia pizza tycoon Herman Cain vying to become the first president to have his own gospel album (it’s true!), and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich vying to run the worst winning campaign since William McKinley campaigned from his front porch.
But the history-making only reaches veritably transcendental proportions when the candidate is a member of an oppressed minority. Election 2008 also-rans Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and ex-Alaska Governor Sarah Palin can both attest to the fact that running against a member of a historically disenfranchised group is an exceedingly difficult task.
So what is Governor Perry to do? He could attempt to emulate the politics of working-class white victimization that the Grand Old Party has perfected to an art form since the Nixon Administration. But as rural America continues to shrivel into an increasingly cantankerous, backwater husk with declining electoral relevance, this class of identity politics may prove inadequate in 2012. Luckily for the governor, he does have one other potential victim card in his hand.
As a native Texan, I can speak to the intolerance on which my state prides itself; hence the political potency of the perennial rumors of our governor’s closeted homosexuality. Festering since at least 2004, when Perry was forced to confront it head-on in The Austin-American Statesman, the ambiguity surrounding the governor’s sexual orientation has routinely provided fodder for colorful political sallying. Even our state Democrats can’t resist some good old gay-baiting.
In the 2010 cycle, for example, Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison was shamefully caught juicing her gubernatorial campaign website with the search engine optimization keywords “rick perry gay.” Democratic political action committee Back to Basics, likewise, ran a delightful statewide newspaper ad campaign asserting that “When he's not in San Francisco … Perry's … flipping through the pages of his Food and Wine magazine … in his fancy … rental mansion,” a message Noreen Malone described on New York Magazine’s Daily Intel blog as “clearly meant to remind voters that Perry's red-blooded American maleness wasn't an established fact.”
Some have predicted that the obstinacy of these rumors will impede Perry’s presidential ambitions in the same way that persistent allegations of President Obama’s Muslim faith and lack of birthright citizenship impeded his. I would suggest, however, that, sadly enough, these rumors might actually be a political godsend for the governor, and the very best political move he could make right now—in what may be a fairly damning indictment of our system—would actually be to embrace them wholeheartedly and come out of the closet as the second openly gay governor in American history (the first, of course, was the disgraced Jim McGreevey of New Jersey).
The political meed of coming out is considerable. The political calculus of a Perry candidacy was that he was perhaps the only politician in America capable of satisfying both the Tea Party and establishment wings of the Republican Party. However, since his announcement, even the Republican establishment has signed on to the fact that Perry is George W. Bush without the intelligence and moderation, and that the American people may not be so keen on hiring the former president’s stunt double so soon after so-emphatically rejecting his legacy by electing Barack Obama in the first place. Polls have confirmed this, for while he does not quite achieve Palin-Bachmann-Gingrich levels of radioactivity on the electoral dosimeter, Perry consistently underperforms frontrunner Mitt Romney in head-to-head polls with President Obama and has yet to beat the incumbent in a single poll. To say the least, Governor Perry has an electability problem.
And that is the beauty of the coming-out strategy.
President Obama faces potentially crippling levels of discontent from his truculent base, and the prospect of an openly gay Republican opponent could drive a decisive wedge between the president and the left. Gay donors and voters rightly disgusted by the president’s prevaricating on the issue of gay marriage may choose to overlook Perry’s virulently anti-gay record and platform to embrace one of their own. The disillusioned latte-sipping yuppies of Cambridge and Manhattan may also decide that the optics of opting for the gay candidate is more conducive to maintaining their self-righteous guise of social progressiveness than the symbolism of retaining the comparatively gay-friendly incumbent.
Of course, there is an obvious ethical issue in a straight man coming out merely for a political advantage, but this is politics we’re discussing, and Rick Perry in particular. Given that he is party to the execution of an innocent man (remember the name Cameron Todd Willingham—you will be hearing it a lot soon), I’m not quite convinced that morality really factors into Governor Perry’s decision-making in any way whatsoever. Furthermore, it’s not as if admitting he is gay would not redound to the nation’s benefit: Were Perry to come out of the closet this Wednesday during the Republican presidential debate, Michele Bachmann’s head could quite possibly explode on live television.

Most Americans, especially the Obama administration, hoped that summer 2010 would be the summer of recovery. It turned out to be the summer of discovery as Americans discovered that the increasingly larger numbers on the national debt clock would actually have to decrease. The result: the November 2010 elections, during which the Tea Party saved the Republican Party and walloped the Democrats. This summer could be characterized as the summer of dysfunction. Washington gridlocked, and there were more fireworks than the Fourth of July. The result: a debt downgrade by a firm infamous for being too generous with its financial rankings. However, like anyone who has suffered through a traffic jam understands, gridlock only requires one bad driver. In summer 2011, the Obama White House failed majestically to acknowledge or address the greatest obstacle to America’s future success.
To be fair, both Democrats and Republicans have contributed to the national debt. The annual deficits under the Bush administration may have been merely a tenth of the size of the deficits under the Obama administration, but Obama is correct in mentioning that he inherited a large national debt and came into office during a period of economic turmoil. He’s done much to attempt to solve the latter but seems alarmingly willing to ignore the former. The national debt this past year was approximately $14 trillion, already a stunningly large sum, but miniscule compared to the future. Largely led by growth in the already expensive entitlement programs, the unfunded obligations of the United States government currently amount to a staggering $61.6 trillion, or $528,000 per household. By 2049, Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security will consume all tax revenue, assuming that tax revenues remain at their historical average.
While President Obama is not fully responsible for these absolutely unsustainable obligations, he is the President of the United States. Presidents are expected to lead not only their party but also the nation—without exception. Inheriting a national problem is not reason to ignore it. Lincoln inherited a nation on the brink of Civil War; he fought for the Union. Reagan inherited a seemingly perpetual Cold War; he defeated an evil empire. Obama inherited a debt crisis. He should have tackled the root of the problem: out of control growth in entitlement spending.
The new Republican majority in the House provided Obama with a genuine chance to tackle the entitlement crisis without fear of political retaliation. Paul Ryan even did the heavy lifting and proposed a plan to reform entitlements and pay off the national debt. Obama responded with a heavily political speech and his own “plan” so vague that, when the Congressional Budget Office was asked to score it, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf responded, “We don’t estimate speeches.” During the entire debt ceiling debate that engulfed the summer, the President of the United States could not come up with a single legitimate plan. The only existing alternative to the Republican plan—the status quo—is entirely unacceptable. Retirement security programs are on their deathbeds, the entire nation is in the sick room, and the President is on holiday from obligations. Raising taxes on “billionaires and millionaires” (plus all those making $250,000 or more) would pay for a mere few days of government spending—clearly not a credible solution.
Compromise requires that two sides come to the table with conflicting proposals and meet in the middle. When one side lacks a plan, it’s near impossible to come to terms. The results of this summer’s debt debate should have been real, bipartisan entitlement reform, but a bipartisan compromise would require that both sides have a plan. For the dysfunction to begin and the recovery to begin, America needs a President who will recognize and address the debt crisis in good faith. The nation needs an upgrade in leadership.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In July, Professor Marc D. Hauser, former co-director of the Mind, Brain, and Behavior program at Harvard, announced his resignation from the University. Hauser was previously found “solely responsible” for eight instances of scientific misconduct following a University internal investigation, which prompted a yearlong leave of absence. Despite the findings, Hauser was allowed to retain his tenured professorship and leadership of the Cognitive Evolution Lab. In April, the Psychology Department barred him from teaching in the next academic year, though not from research. An ongoing federal investigation by the Office of Research Integrity may still be underway to determine if Hauser misused federal grants to commit scientific misconduct.
In April, we argued that Harvard should have taken a more aggressive stance in response to the findings of the investigative committee and fired Hauser. Hauser's prohibition from further research and teaching would have been a logical consequence of his actions. It would have forcefully upheld the imperative for honesty and accuracy in the sciences. Tenure, a privilege given to distinguished professors, is no shield for academic misconduct.
As such, despite measure of closure that Hauser’s resignation brings to this situation, it remains that the University should have taken stronger and earlier disciplinary action against him. Harvard is a preeminent research institution, and scientific results sourced here are widely trusted and respected. This benefits every academic on campus, from undergraduates to professors. Even though grant money, Ph.D. candidates, and postdoctoral fellows may keep flowing to Harvard programs, the intangible damage to the University’s scientific community is unacceptable. By firing Hauser, Harvard would have sent a firm message that academic dishonesty is not tolerated. In contrast, Hauser's resignation is an evasion of full culpability and deemphasizes the gravity of his actions. Allowing Hauser to save face and graciously depart his position offers little recourse for the multitude of scientific malfeasances that were committed.
Therefore, moving forward, the University should regularize the process of faculty discipline in cases of academic dishonesty. This will make the process of removing tenure faster and less personal. Furthermore, the consequences of these proceedings should adequately reflect the nature of the misconduct committed. Harvard undergraduates are held to high standards regarding academic discipline—professors with positions of influence should be equally, if not more, accountable for their deeds. By refusing to take bold action and instead allowing for a willing resignation, the University has downplayed the severity of his academic dishonesty.
In addition to standardizing the faculty discipline process, the University should also commit to making its internal investigations more transparent, if findings are negative. We applaud the Vice Provost for Research’s decision to form a Committee on Confidentiality in Research Misconduct Proceedings. This committee was announced almost a year ago, and we eagerly await its recommendations. We hope they include that the University should make public the findings of internal committee investigations, assuming a guilty verdict is reached—before The Boston Globe does.
Harvard's lack of decisive action throughout this situation permitted Hauser to evade full responsibility and delayed the public acknowledgement of his research's inaccuracy. Harvard’s passivity could have allowed tainted findings on his cotton-top tamarind monkey experiments to continue to mislead the scientific community. The University sustained the verdict on Hauser's misconducts in the same fashion that he committed them: behind closed doors. This issue of a lack of transparency is not unique to our institution. However, no matter what the school, transparency is an integral part of maintaining an open and well-informed academic environment. All universities must commit to maintaining transparency regarding faculty academic integrity, particularly in instances where the results can affect the course of scientific literature and research.

Bob Slate, Stationer will re-open one store in Harvard Square this fall under new ownership.
The local art and office supply chain shut down its three Cambridge locations last spring after the owners of the family business decided not to renew the stores’ leases.
The new owner, Laura E. Donohue ’85, will set up shop at 30 Brattle Street, a previous location of the store from more than two decades ago.
Bob Slate had been a fixture of Harvard Square for 78 years. The stores were owned by Justin and Mallory Slate, sons of founder Bob Slate. The Slates closed all three locations at 1288 Mass. Ave, 63 Church St., and in Porter Square in March.
Panera Bread purchased the Mass. Ave location and plans to open a store there this fall.
The Slates, who reconfigured their business as a stationery store after Staples moved into the Square in 1986, had been searching for a “new owner to re-invent the company and take it forward into the 21st century.”
Donohue, a patron of the store since her days as a Harvard undergraduate, hopes she can bring a forward-thinking vision that still pays homage to the store’s past.
“There will be some updating of the product line,” Donohue said. “There will be a lot of the regular products that customers liked, yet there is always a need for innovation and freshness, so those things will be folded in gently. The intent is to keep the content of the store the same, yet bring in new things that shift as time goes by.”
Donohue also plans to hire former employees from Bob Slate’s three locations, though she acknowledged that with less retail space, she cannot employ everyone. “Bob Slate employees were a key part of the customer experience,” she said. “They were knowledgeable and long-time employees. Customers knew them by name, and they knew customers by name. I’m hoping some will continue that legacy.”
Building on this history while incorporating new elements like a social media presence and an online store is a challenge she is ready to undertake, Donohue said.
The Slate brothers worked closely with Donohue as she has taken over the store’s management.
“What they’re looking for is to continue their legacy, but with new and fresh ideas,” Donohue said. “I’m very sensitive to the fact that this is their father’s name, and they didn’t sell it to just anyone. We are working together to bring the best of the past and the future together.”

Allegedly on President Obama’s shortlist to join the seven-member board of the Federal Reserve, Harvard Economics Professor Jeremy C. Stein would bring a wide breadth of experience in banking regulation and finance to a board of governors that only has two PhDs. But perhaps more importantly, Stein has staked out a series of positions that fall to the left of the Obama administration’s economic policy, which may make it difficult for Stein to gain confirmation before the Senate.
Stein, a Democrat, has been an active voice—and D.C. leader—in the discussions of restructuring the financial systems and crafting macroeconomic monetary and fiscal policy in response to the turbulent economy of the past three years.
If formally nominated, Stein will be returning to a familiar city. A former senior aide to University Professor Lawrence H. Summers when he served as director of the National Economic Council during the Obama’s administration, Stein worked for half a year on reforming the nation’s capital markets and regulatory system.
Stein’s colleague in the Economics Department Claudia Goldin was hesitant to offer premature congratulations, but she said he would be a strong asset, if he were nominated and approved.
“He would be excellent—I mean he is very intelligent, very judicious,” Goldin said. “It would be good for the country.”
Stein was an active critic of an early version of the Troubled Asset Relief Program—the $700 billion program that purchased mortgage-backed securities that played a key role in the 2008 financial crisis and exposed banks to potentially major losses.
The bill made the government a large, non-voting shareholder of preferred stock in the nine largest American banks. While the Congressional Budget Office estimated in late 2010 that the program would cost taxpayers approximately $25 billion, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has defended the program by arguing that the investments in banks have largely paid for themselves.
At the time, Stein balked at the plan, arguing that the assets purchased by the government could have been over=priced. Stein also levelled criticism against the program in his academic work, in which he lambasted features of the plan that preserved dividends for shareholders in banks bailed out by the government.
“These dividends, if they are paid at current levels, will redirect more than $25 billion of the $125 billion to shareholders in the next year alone,” Stein wrote in an op-ed in The New York Times that he co-wrote  with Harvard Business School Professor David S. Schaferstein. “The government should close the door by putting an immediate stop to the dividend payouts of any banks receiving direct federal support. The purpose is not just to be fair or to avoid unsavory appearances, but to improve the health of the banks and the economy,” the two professors wrote.
In general, Stein has argued in favor of imposing stricter regulations on banks. In a July 2010 working paper, Stein argued in favor of a “macroprudential” approach to banking regulation—protecting the overall financial system instead of bailing out individual firms as was done during the 2008 financial crisis. In that paper, Stein also contended that financial regulation should not just apply to deposit-taking banks but also to other actors in financial markets, a view that calls for tighter regulation of institutions.
Stein’s positions in favor of increased regulation may draw the ire of Senate Republicans who have made a point of campaigning against White House nominees whom they view as too willing to interfere in free market systems.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Stein’s name rose to the fore as the White House narrowed down its search a few months ago. The White House is also reported to be considering a conservative nominee to pair with the more liberal Stein. Richard H. Clarida, a professor at Columbia University and an executive vice president of Pacific Investment Management Company, the world’s largest bond fund, is another name that has been mentioned for one of the two open spots in the Washington D.C. board, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The seven-member board joins a rotating cast of four regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in comprising the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed’s governing body.

During the transfer of Harvard @college email accounts to new Google hosted accounts, a handful of students received emails from individuals who share their surname, raising privacy concerns for some who chose to switch email systems.
Thousands of students have successfully accessed their new Google hosted @college email accounts, and fewer than ten students have experienced the glitch, according to Sarah O’Connell, a spokesperson for Harvard University Information Technology.
The transition replaced an outdated, difficult-to-use email client with a Google-powered interface that closely mirrors the popular Gmail email service.
In the week following the August 15th switch to a gmail interface, 3,900 students accessed their new Gmail-hosted @college account, O’Connell said.
But some students found that their emails were ending up in a stranger’s inbox.
For years, Harvard undergraduates used @fas email addresses, but starting in fall of 2009 the College began a transition to @college accounts. New students were given @college accounts while older students were given the option to switch or keep their @fas address.
In August, the College moved students’ email accounts onto Gmail servers and assigned @college addresses to those who chose to use the new service. Emails to their old accounts were forwarded to their new addresses.
If a student’s @fas username had been taken by a younger student on @college, he or she was provided with a separate username—but the service that forwarded emails to the students’ new accounts sometimes overlooked this detail.
For example, the email belonging to Kane Hsieh ’12, a Crimson photo editor, had been khsieh@fas.harvard.edu while Karina Hsieh ’13 was khsieh@college.harvard.edu. So Kane Hsieh appended his class year to his email address to become khsieh12@college.harvard.edu.
But during the transition period, emails sent to @fas accounts were forwarded to the same username on an @college account—Karina Hsieh’s email account.
Bethina Liu ’13, who is also a Crimson photo editor, found herself in a similar situation. She described the process of fixing the forwarding glitch as “drawn-out” and “involved.”
“They really should’ve thought this through before—it’s a big transition,” she said. “This was a pretty big breach of privacy.”
Because her newfound email partner had not responded to repeated emails from HUIT—and phone calls from Liu—she is still left to be receiving emails from the other Liu.
When Kathy K. Wang ’14 signed into her new email account, she found messages in her inbox that were not intended for her and realized that emails for the other Kathy Wang in the Class of 2014 were being forwarded to the wrong address.
“Fortunately nothing bad happened,” Wang said. “It would have been [a problem] if I were in school, but since it’s the summer I don’t really use my @college account very much, so I wasn’t getting that many interruptions.”
While most of the initial kinks have been fixed, there still appear to be problems with the system. In Harvard directories, both individuals named Kathy Wang have the same email listed.

Peter Chen ’13 had shopped the perennially popular Sociology 109: “Leadership and Organizations” last fall, so he expected the course to be somewhat crowded when he visited it again Wednesday on the first day of shopping period.
But when he arrived at the start of the class, student shoppers were already overflowing out the door, blocking Chen’s entrance into the lecture hall.
“I tried to push in a little bit and funnel into the room,” said Chen, who was forced to stand outside the lecture hall for about 10 minutes before wiggling his way into a newly empty chair.
Another Sociology 109 shopper, Stephanie L. Grayson ’14, said she showed up a full 20 minutes early to ensure a seat in the class, which she suspected would be crowded because it was taught by popular sociology lecturer David L. Ager. The course—which will be lotteried down to 80 students by the end of shopping period—drew about 180 shoppers, according to Ager.
This year, as the College moves to better anticipate student enrollment before the semester begins, undergraduates continued their sometimes unpredictable practice of shopping for classes.
This is the second semester since the implementation of the Pre-Term Planning Tool—which requires students to indicate the classes they plan to take in the upcoming term.
While College administrators say the tool predicts final enrollment numbers and not shopping patterns, many professors said that the tool also helped them to estimate how many students would show up during shopping period.
But those estimates are never perfect.
Arleen Aguasvivas ’15 had to sit on the floor at the crowded first lecture of Ethical Reasoning 30: “The Just World,” a new General Education course that she said she did not expect to be so popular.  She estimated that the course drew about 100 shoppers.
On the other hand, Christopher F. Allison ’12 was not surprised when he was forced to sit in the aisle in the packed first lecture of English 157: “The Classic Phase of the Novel,” which drew about 150 shoppers in its second year after being modified to fulfill the Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding Gen Ed requirement.
“Any sort of class that counts for a Gen Ed and is rated above a ‘4’ in the Q Guide is going to be really, really crowded,” Allison said.
Another Gen Ed course—Culture and Belief 22: “Concepts of the Hero in Classical Greek Civilization”­—drew about 100 students, a turnout that was “a bit larger” than the number predicted by Pre-Term Planning, according to Professor of Classical Greek Literature Gregory Nagy.
Notably absent among Wednesday’s big classes was the perennially well-attended Government 1540: “The American Presidency,” which is not being offered this fall for the first time since it was introduced in 1993. The class’s professor, Roger B. Porter, is on sabbatical.

This year Harvard freshmen started what administrators hope will be a new tradition: they signed a pledge promising to uphold values tied to the College’s mission.
The “Class of 2015 Pledge” committed students to transforming Harvard into a “place where all can thrive and where the exercise of kindness holds a place on par with intellectual attainment.”
That decision drew fire from former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis.
“It’s very unscholarly,” Lewis said. “It’s very unlike Harvard.”
Though students were told that signing the pledge was voluntary, most proctors are displaying a signed copy of the pledge somewhere in their entryway. Critics say, if a person opts out of the pledge, their decision to do so would be broadcast for all to see in the form of a blank, unsigned line amidst a sea of signatures.
“The most important thing was to get our values out. Things like respect, integrity, kindness,” Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said. “We want to have an environment in which people can flourish academically.”
Dingman said that the introduction of the pledge was motivated not by a specific incident, but by growing concerns that some Harvard students are not “thoughtful or considerate in their actions with their peers.”
Administrators also said that this effort is not connected to discussions of academic integrity, and that the 2015 pledge is not an early attempt at an informal honor code.
Many freshmen said that although the content of the pledge may have seemed intuitive, they appreciated the attempt to vocalize the College’s values.
“I think it was great that they actually put it in writing,” Pennypacker resident Denise I. Acosta ’15 said. “It kind of made everyone more comfortable.”
Students signed the pledge before the third annual convocation ceremony in Tercentenary Theatre.
Lewis first articulated his criticism of the pledge in a blog post that attracted the attention of The American Council of Trustees and Alumni—a national non-profit.
Linking this most recent development to controversial freshmen orientation programs at the University of Delaware and Hamilton College, ACTA program associate Max Brindle said that “pledges like these harm intellectual communities more than they benefit them.”
Despite Lewis’s concerns, many freshmen said that they had not heard of any of their classmates declining to sign the pledge.
“There might have been a little bit of pressure because most people were signing it and it’s going to be in public view,” said Ari Albanese ’15. “But I don’t think anyone was really against it.”
The pledge came out of a committee of students and administrators, including Dingman, Freshman Yard deans Jonas V. Clark and Catherine R. Shapiro, and Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College announced Thursday that it will offer a record $166 million in financial aid for the 2012-2013 academic year and that it will increase the family income level under which tuition is waived.
Now, families with normal assets and income up to $65,000 will not be required to pay any tuition. Previously only families with normal assets and income up to $60,000 were not required to pay tuition.
The Office of Admissions and Financial Aid also unveiled a new “net price calculator” that allows need-based scholarship applicants to estimate expected family and student contributions.
“Access and affordability, enabled by generous financial aid, are fundamental to Harvard’s identity and excellence,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “We admit students without regard to their financial need, and we make sure that they are given the means to attend and take advantage of the Harvard College experience. This is a bedrock commitment.”
The financial aid calculator­—now accessible on the home page of Harvard’s financial aid website—allows users to input data such as parent income, student assets, and parent assets. The calculator then provides an estimate of the scholarship that the student would receive.
“We wanted to make sure it was an accurate estimate as we can provide,” said Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue. “The calculator provides them with the good information that Harvard really is affordable.”
Though the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 mandates that postsecondary institutions post a “net price calculator” on their websites by this October, Fitzsimmons said that his office has been considering something similar for a decade. The new calculator, he said, is the product of much research and consideration by Donahue and the office’s staff.
Since the University unveiled the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, which greatly expanded and simplified Harvard’s financial aid offerings, the total scholarship budget has increased dramatically. Since 2007 it has increased by more than 70 percent from approximately $97 million to next year’s record $166 million.
“I think it will be hugely encouraging,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said, referring to how he anticipates the decision will affect prospective applicants. “I think that it has never been more important for Harvard to move forward with this kind of commitment.”
Fitzsimmons said that providing a full scholarship to students from families that make less than $65,000 is important to Harvard’s effort to attract top students.
“It really is about excellence. You want to get the financial aid assistance to the people who need it most,” Fitzsimmons said. “This is a very deliberate process—we’re trying to help real families.”
Current students whose financial circumstances have changed will also benefit from the increase in available aid, according to Donahue. Students regularly inform the Office of changes to their financial situation, Donahue said.
Fitzsimmons said that during his own time as a student at the College he visited his financial aid office several times and the experience stuck with him.
“The intangible commitment that we’re with you,” Fitzsimmons said. “It makes all the difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Hong Kong Restaurant—one of the Square’s most popular late night stops—is petitioning to extend its closing time to 3 a.m.
Paul Lee, the restaurant’s manager, has also applied to amend the Harvard Square restaurant’s Sunday opening hour from 12 p.m. to 11 a.m., according to the City of Cambridge License Commission agenda.
Undergraduates on several mailing lists this week had expressed concerns that the City of Cambridge had told the Kong to close at an earlier hour after a vaguely written agenda item on the city website said that the Kong’s closing time was under review. In fact, Cambridge is considering extending its closing time.
“[T]he city of Cambridge wants to close “the Kong” early, meaning no more late-night food. You are all entitled to your own opinions on the matter, but there is a petition at the restaurant that you can sign if you do not want this to happen!” alleged one Pforzheimer undergraduate student to the House’s email list.
“[T]his is the worst news i’ve [sic] heard all day, and I just read an article about climate change, orphans, and sad kittens,” one student wrote to the Quincy-Open list upon hearing that the Kong had been told to close earlier.
Students on the Quincy email list also speculated that late night drunken crowds may have also contributed to the rumor that the City was pressuring the Kong to close at an earlier time.
Lee, who has declined to comment on the situation, has placed a petition for customers to sign at the greeting counter to his restaurant. A note on the clipboard states that the petition is to extend dining room food to 3 a.m. seven days a week.
He will be accepting signatures through Monday.
Currently, the restaurant is open from 11:30 a.m. every day until 2 a.m. Sunday through Wednesday. On Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays it is open until 2:30 a.m., according to the restaurant’s website.
Lee’s father, Sen Lee, opened the restaurant in 1954 and was honored by Cambridge City Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 in 1997 as exemplifying the ideals of the American Dream.
Lee is expected to appear in front of the License Commission board on Tuesday at 6 p.m.
