After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Are Rihanna albums a little pointless? If recent history has anything to say, we’re going to be bombarded with singles from her latest record, “Unapologetic,” for the next twelve months anyway. Did you know that this is Rihanna’s fourth straight year releasing an album in mid-November? If you didn’t, it’s because you encounter her music like most people: through singles and their remixes as they become popular. Because Rihanna’s songs exist independently of each other in practice, it is weirdly unnatural to find them compiled on a single disc, free of interruptions.
But even if “Unapologetic” is pointless, its individual songs mostly aren’t. While some of the album suffers from a combination of lazy, uninspiring production and a dearth of decent pop melodies, Rihanna’s experimentation with a variety of musical styles makes “Unapologetic” her most enjoyable batch of songs since 2007’s “Good Girl Gone Bad,” even if its unsettling lyrical content can detract from the music at times.
Let’s start with the bad, because “Unapologetic” definitely does. Excepting lead single and second track “Diamonds,” the album’s first five tracks are over-synthed, plodding, and most damningly, just not catchy. Put it this way: you’re not going to be furtively humming the monotonous, three-note choruses of “Numb” or “Pour It Up” in class like you did with last year’s “We Found Love” or “Where Have You Been.” Those hits had similarly trashy, synthed-up production, but they at least possessed absurdly memorable hooks.
However, the hooks start to pop up soon enough. “Jump” and “What Now” are sure to be future hits, featuring infectious choruses that make superb use of those wobbly, growling bass blasts that your teenage sister confidently terms “dubstep.” (Hi America! Please stop calling every electronic song “dubstep.” Thanks!) “What Now” works especially well because it builds tension through soft, piano-based verses and bridges; every time the massive chorus hits, you’re itching for it. On the polar opposite end of the musical spectrum, “No Love Allowed,” a refreshingly minimalist reggae jam, is carried by Rihanna’s excellent, Marley-esque vocals. It’s nice to hear Rihanna perform the occasional ballad or reggae song, because, as past ballads “Take A Bow” and “Fool In Love” prove, she certainly has more vocal chops and interpretive ability than your average dance music star.
Then there’s Chris Brown. There will be plenty written about lyrical choices, Brown, and domestic violence in relation to “Unapologetic,” but in short: yes, Rihanna sometimes uses violent metaphors, yes, she duets with Brown, and yes, these choices can make “Unapologetic” a difficult listen. When Rihanna sings lines such as “Felt like love struck me in the night  / I prayed that love don't strike twice” and “Boy, I just wanna be in your possession,” it’s hard to focus on the music and easy to make the glaring, real-life connections to what transpired between her and Brown in the past few years. This jarring lyricism peaks during Brown and Rihanna’s duet, “Nobody’s Business,” which features an wonderfully glitzy, MJ-emulating beat co-written and co-produced by The-Dream. First off, Chris Brown should never, ever have been allowed to sing the words “Girl, let me love you and show you how special you are.” However, wait until the duo asks each other “I wonder, can we become love’s persona?” to really start squirming in your seat. If the song had featured almost anyone other than Chris Brown, “Nobody’s Business” might have been the best song on “Unapologetic,” but the song is a rare example of how context and lyrics can overshadow the music. These kinds of lyrics don’t completely derail “Unapologetic,” but they do distract and detract from the music itself.
Lyrical discomfort aside, “Unapologetic” represents a musical progression for Rihanna. Although it contains a few lingering remnants of the mindless production that’s hampered her in the past, the album is mostly enjoyable and engaging, whether Rihanna is singing reggae, disco, or that wobbly-growly bass genre. Sure, it’s going to be impossible to escape a good number of these songs for the next year, but given how solid they are, there probably won’t be too many people complaining.

5.  Li Shang (from “Mulan”)
For one, if you think Jeremy Lin challenges the conventional stereotype of the Asian man, take a look at Shang; his animated muscles could break Lin in half.  Second, Shang is voiced by the sexy B.D. Wong—for those of you who are bad at telling Asians apart, he played Dr. George Huang on “Law  & Order: SVU” for over 10 years.
4.  Simba (from “The Lion King”)
Yeah, he’s a lion, but he’s still a freaking prince. I’m a sucker for royalty (like, Prince of Wales royalty, not White Castle or Burger King royalty). Simba also rocks that mane like no other. In addition,  his unexpectedly dark quip also makes me weak in the knees: “I laugh in the face of danger!” I love bad boys—I mean, lions.  Stop judging.
3.  Flynn Rider (from “Tangled”)
Flynn is one of the most recent and hottest Disney princes. He pulls off a goatee, and his torso boasts unrealistic proportions that would make Ken jealous. What makes Flynn number three, though, is his signature look: “the smolder.” Since seeing that, I have believed in the power of animated films.
2.  The Beast (from “Beauty and the Beast”)
Ahh, the Beast. “Beauty and the Beast” was the first Broadway show I ever saw; you never forget your first. He makes my city-girl, English-concentrator heart beat so fast (out of fear?). But he also teaches little girls the very important lesson that you can completely transform a man—body and soul, fur and fangs—with your love. I mean, that’s how love works, right? If your man is still a beast, clearly you need to work harder and make more sandwiches.
1.  Nicholas T Rinehart (from “Arts Board”)
Is our outgoing—not outgoing in that sense—columns exec technically a Disney prince? No. But am I his Disney princess? No; I’m not really his demographic. But is he my Disney prince? Absolutely. Once you get past his curmudgeonly demeanor, his secretly sweet nature and piercing gray eyes are to die for. Would I die for him? No; I’ll leave that to Pocahontas. Would he die for me? Probs not; I mentioned I’m not his demographic, right? But his side-splitting quips and reluctant smile make him prince enough for me.
—Hayley C. Cuccinello is the outgoing Covers Executive. She also has served as Sentimental Executive and Food Executive. She loves mice, vivid lipstick, and the Arts board.

TOP 5 BEST FICTIONAL PLACES FOR PACING
You’re a college student writing a paper, you’re besieged by arguments about social theory, you have to walk back and forth messing up your hair. Where do you wish you were?
5. A Mine inside the “Big Rock Candy Mountain”
Burly socialists who have been relieved of all labor in Utopia wait around to help people like you write a response paper on The Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.
4. The Bathroom in “Norwegian Wood”
 
The bird’s flown the coop. You’re alone in her place. As you run water for the bath, you wonder, Did I have her or did she have me? You write a short short about it for Hempel. Frustrated, or maybe in expectation of insurance money, you commit arson.
3. Latin Quarter Garret in “Lost Illusions”
Your great love, a showgirl and courtesan, is on the verge of death from tuberculosis. Your protectress demands you attend theater with her to be watched by the binoculars of Society. Your family starves in the rural ghetto. Your brilliance is being wasted on petty journalism. You live in a one-room studio penthouse. You have just enough room to gesticulate all afternoon while writing a book of poetry and exclamation points.
2. Vienna Alleyway in “The Third Man”
 
Austrians burn currency in the street for warmth. Bus boys exchange notes and glare at you. The world is black-and-white. Everyone wears trench coats. You wander the streets, looking for a villainous Orson Welles and an idea for your next pulpy Western paperback.

It’s late at night in the Midwest of 1915, you’ve secreted away the librarian’s daughter for a walk, you're thinking about your lonely mother, the city, literary fame. You look up at the stars and feel full of your own insignificance. You will write your novel, someday. In the meantime, you admire the authenticity of your overalls.

Everyone likes lists. They’re easy, unassuming, non-threatening. They sidestep the need for all that pesky “literary” stuff like narrative arcs, fluidity of prose, graceful transitions, what have you. No one objects to an abrupt shift in idea or theme when it’s part of a list.
0. People should focus less on the best and the worst. A close look at the middle of the pack is refreshing sometimes. Imagine, “Vanilla is a pretty okay flavor for ice cream, but these others are also alright.”
1. Lists don’t have to be linear. What is this, 1950? It’s practically the end of the world; we shouldn’t be afraid to have some innovative list formats. Exponential, logarithmic for those lists that span multiple orders of magnitude. Maybe set some function f(x) where x is the real rank of that fifth cheesiest Michael Bolton song. (hint: in this example it’s 5)
1.  After you’ve hooked the reader with the first two items on the list, feel free to take a break. They’ll read the next couple items out of sheer inertia.
2.   Lists are pretty neat.
3.  I wonder what that kid from Home Alone has been up to.
5.  Does this list make my thighs look big?
8.  Oh, shit. Time to write again.
13.  Really, the substance of a list has very little to do with how much people will enjoy it. People have already decided they don’t want to read a real article, they just want bite-sized noms of opinion. Feel free to tell them what to think as long as you include a joke or two along the way.
21.  This is the greatest list. You’re really enjoying it.
34.  Have you heard the one about nostalgia? Yeah, I remember that one. I miss it.
55.  When it comes time for the list to end, make sure you end on a strong note that people will remember. Listen to the gentle stirrings of your heart and lay down the subtle sounds for your reader. Make them feel as if you have left some part of yourself on the page as a sort of modern zen koan, and maybe you might dampen their discursive thought for a moment so that they might be able to find a piece of themselves as well.
89.  Chocolate is also a pretty cool flavor of ice cream.

The 2010s are shaping up to be the era of regurgitation. Musicians and filmmakers like to gobble up massive amounts of past and present work, chew it around, and burp up something sort of new; consequently, pop music tastes like ’80s disco and ’90s electronica, Hollywood’s cornucopia of adaptations and threequels stays comfortably familiar, and so on. A lot of these appropriations suck already, but the question always remains just how far today’s culturemeisters will go. Consider the possibilities—or, maybe, hopefully, the impossibilities, but what the heck.
1.     Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music crew vs. “The Clique” novels
It seems like a win-win. West’s new crew could connect with a younger market (catty 14-year-olds) for its single “Clique,” while Lisi Harrison’s young-adult novels would get a huge popularity jump from Yeezy’s star power.
Yes, these novels have already enjoyed a direct-to-DVD adaptation that starred a girl from my high school. But what’s to say they don’t deserve another cinematic treatment, one in which West’s gang parties with the series’ young, er, heroines? On second thought—with lines like “She trying get me that poontang / I might let my crew bang” in the G.O.O.D. single, maybe a collaborative adaptation of a series for teen girls is a terrible, awful idea.
2.     Christopher Nolan vs. the Legion of Super-Pets
The new Batman trilogy’s helmer is undoubtedly brilliant, but is he versatile? His films, apart from his gritty, psychologically complex trilogy, are gritty, psychologically complex crime films, and over half include Michael Caine. It would be impressive if Nolan could nail a completely different genre—say, the deceptively simplistic family film.
The Legion of Super-Pets comprises actual characters from ’50s and ’60s DC Comics. Maybe Nolan could have fun with Krypto the Superdog—an “Air Bud of Steel”-type thing—but it seems less likely that he could work successfully with Beppo the Super-Monkey or Comet the Super-Horse, even had the parts been voiced by Heath Ledger.
3.     Jack Black vs. Sir Thomas More, Plato, etc.
Black starred in 2010’s inexplicable “Gulliver’s Travels,” a wonderful production with a cast member credited as “Butt-crack man.” With the next “Kung-Fu Panda” slated for 2016, why shouldn’t he belly flop into other classic fantastical-society texts, like Plato’s “The Republic” or More’s “Utopia”? Of course, “Gulliver’s” was an outlandishly bad film, dramatically and comically unfulfilling as well as totally divorced from Jonathan Swift’s satirical source text, but that’s nothing to stop a 20th Century Fox-ified “Utopia.”
4.     Sam Mendes vs. “The Sandlot”
At the end of the 1993 family classic, we learn what happens to the baseball gang—Timmy and Tommy become architects, Squints buys the local drugstore, etc. But the film took place in 1962, so its characters were adults the ’90s, which means that at least some of their lives probably became pretty damn depressing.
Enter Mendes: the director’s Bond installment “Skyfall” is a smash, but he made his name depicting tortured suburban existences in films like “American Beauty” and “Revolutionary Road.” Who better to jump decades forward with the “Sandlot” gang in what would probably be a fairly moving film, albeit one that stamps out every spark of childlike wonderment left in your soul?
5.     U2 vs. Taylor Swift
How could she? Nay, how dare T-Swift release her new album, “Red,” last month without proceeds going to combat HIV/AIDS in Africa? I’m going to let you finish, Taylor, but Bono has the better artistic enterprise (eh, sort of) involving the word “red”: Product Red, which partners with other companies to sell special versions of stuff like iPods and Armani clothes and then donates profits to fight disease. Taylor, looking to experiment with new genres, could settle her debt by collabing with Bono’s band—except that that would nail shut the coffin of one of the world’s greatest rock groups.
—Austin Siegemund-Broka is the outgoing Campus Arts Executive and incoming Arts Chair. He comes from a time when “puns used to be the highest form of humor.”

Lana del Rey confuses me. Where did she come from? How did she get so popular so quickly? Why does she remind me of Daisy Buchanan if Daisy had spent at least six months in Stepford? Why do her lyrics make me so uncomfortable? What are all the things she wants to do? Why did she ever pen the line “my pussy tastes like Pepsi-Cola”? Why did I listen to a loop of that lyric for twenty minutes alone in my room two Saturdays ago? Why do I put on Born to Die whenever I need guidance in my life? Why do I feel compelled to share this advice with others? Why won’t my friends talk to me anymore?
 Put your Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice. Nobody likes a warm beer, especially if it’s PBR. The subtle aromas and nuanced bouquet of America’s premier beer are ruined completely if the cans lose their chill. Plus, it has been rumored that if you stand in front of a mirror and whisper “Pabst Blue Ribbon on iiiiiice” three times, LDR herself will appear and make over-the-shoulder doe eyes at you until you die.
Do a lot of cocaine. Drugs are really cool. Lana del Rey does a lot of them. She’s also really into guys who do them. LDR especially likes when you do so much cocaine that it literally turns your heart into cocaine.
Don’t play your video games. She even put her favorite perfume on.
Kiss her on her open mouth in the pouring rain. On Born to Die, LDR makes no less than three references to kissing her on her open mouth. She is remarkably specific about this, so it’s clear this is important to her—and by extension to all girls, as Lana is the epitome of femininity. Do not kiss her on her closed mouth. Do not kiss her on the neck. Do not kiss her anywhere other than in the pouring rain. Do not leave without kissing her, on her open mouth, in the pouring rain.
Keep your genitals clean. As previously mentioned, Lana del Rey’s pussy allegedly tastes like Pepsi-Cola. This is probably a bad thing, and could be potentially lethal if she does not visit a gynecologist in the near future. Perhaps she is just playing a character in order to demonstrate the importance of genital hygiene. Perhaps she is crying out for help. Perhaps I am crying out for help. Help.

The Great Gatsby (1974) - Like boats beating ceaslessly into the past, this 1974 adaptation beats mercilessly at your sanity. If you skipped reading the book in high school and watched the movie instead, I’m sorry. While the 1974 version has all the flashy detail of the novel, it has none of the heart.
The Da Vinci Code (2006) - It takes a lot of courage to uncover age-old secrets — and a lot of effort to turn a page-turner with a leading cast of Tom Hanks and Audrey Tatou, a  mult-million dollar budget, and a surplus of studio magic into a floundering film with what seems an artificial plot and melodramatic acting.
Twilight (2008) - With all the sophistication of a rusted pickup in Forks, only most fanatical of Twi-hards can find redeeming features in this bizarre, dark, and awkward adaptation, at whose screenings the only people being drained of vital life forces were viewers who forked over $12.50 for 122 minutes of pain.
The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy (2005) - A lovable and self-deprecating book says so long and thanks for all the wit and charm in an overworked film version that puts a serious dent in the appeal of the original. Depressing.
Ella Enchanted (2004) - 10-year olds everywhere resented this film, which deviated so much from its original roots as a popular  young adult novel that it was magically transformed into an almost entirely unrelated Hollywood cash cow.
One Day  (2011) - Anne Hathaway just can’t get a break. Despite the film having all the building blocks of a successful romantic drama — a likable leading duo of Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, capable director Lone Scherfig, and a best-selling novel as material — One Day manages to turn an esteemed book into a predictable and bland movie.
—Staff writer Ola Topczewska, the incoming Campus Arts Exec, likes her movies the way she likes her coffee: complex, strong, and envigorating.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, we learned that the three referenda on this year’s Undergraduate Council ballot passed by large majorities. The proposals, advocating University divestment from the fossil fuel industry, the establishment of a social choice endowment fund, and a reworking of the College's sexual assault policies, garnered 72 percent, 80.5 percent, and 85 percent of the vote, respectively. One might expect that, after receiving resounding student approval, these policies would receive carful review from the administration. After all, it wouldn’t take much for University administrators to constructively engage with the ideas in each of these proposals, and overwhelming student support offers ample reason to do so—especially when it comes to issues, like the sexual assault policy revision, which primarily affect undergraduates. Yet, the University has, by all appearances, deigned to treat the student referenda as inconsequential. It is disturbing that the administration has chosen to display such a cold disregard for the voice of the student body.
Prior even to the passage of the referenda, Dean Hammonds said, “there’s a lot of work that needs to be done before [the sexual assault policy referendum] becomes the basis for changes.” It is apparent that Dean Hammonds does not consider undergraduate referenda sufficient reason to reexamine policies that almost exclusively affect undergraduate life. Similarly, shortly after the passage of the referenda, Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin mirrored this sentiment. He said in an email statement to the Crimson that “Harvard is not considering divesting from companies related to fossil fuels”—writing off, it seems, a reexamination of investment practices, despite a resounding call from the student body to the contrary. Of course, we do not expect that undergraduate plebiscites unilaterally dictate Harvard’s investment decisions. Nevertheless, it is disappointing to receive indication that the undergraduate student body’s opinion holds very little weight in the minds of University administrators.  A proper response to these referenda will take into account the concerns of the University’s many constituent groups. But the first step is not stonewalling the student body.
Carrying the imprimatur of the democratic process, and the mandate of heavy majorities, these three referenda should prompt the administration to open up their closed doors, and to respect the student body’s role as a stakeholder and partner in governing the campus and University. Students like Kate Sim ’14 and Pearl Bhatnagar ’14, who proposed the referendum on sexual assault policy, should be welcomed into the meetings where the feasibility of changes to that policy are discussed. Representatives from Divest Harvard should have the chance to engage in a thoughtful face-to-face debate with the president of the University on the subject of fossil fuel divestment.
We are confident in the ability of Harvard student activists to effect change, regardless of how receptive the administration initially appears. It is imperative that activists don’t prematurely give up the fight, as history shows us that the administration usually comes around in due time, once pressure multiplies.
But with the referenda process, the ball is in the administration’s court. It should not take weeks of sleeping outside in tents to bring student activists to the negotiating table with President Faust. The administration has been given a unique chance to inaugurate a new era of responsiveness to and partnership with students, and we expect them to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around the holiday season, I usually donate to charitable organizations as “gifts” for my friends and family. In light of recent (and ongoing) debates about international humanitarian aid, I found myself researching the literature and discussions of the effectiveness of humanitarian aid in developing countries. The arguments I am interested in exploring are those that claim that international humanitarian aid is unable to fix long-term problems in developing countries, that it is at best a “band-aid” approach and at worst a destructive and corrupting force.
Governments of the Western industrialized world have provided over $4.6 trillion in aid to developing countries over the last half-century. This is problematic because studies have shown that there is a correlation between increase in foreign aid and decrease in economic growth. Aid promotes foreign imports, which may threaten local businesses and limit national and international trade. Considering that 70 percent of public funds in Africa come from aid, one can imagine the detrimental effects it has had on the economies of the continent.
Aside from economic consequences, humanitarian aid may often end up in the hands of the corrupt and can have unforeseen ramifications that completely alter a country’s trajectory. Whether it be through the tax dollars paid to the government that finances systematic aid or a personal donation to an ineffective charity, sometimes our donated money falls into the hands of oppressive regimes. Accountability is difficult to enforce, and money frequently ends up in the wrong hands. Monetary aid is most always given in government-to-government transfers, prompting abuse of funds by regimes in power to further the personal interests of politicians. By way of example, Mobutu Sese Seko, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 1965 to 1997, has been accused of robbing billions of dollars from his country. Mobutu isn’t the only one. The African Union estimates that corruption costs the continent $150 billion a year.
Additionally, conditional aid can allow countries to dictate the policies of another. Aid with strings attached often gives donor countries the power to create labor-market restrictions that damage a developing country’s human capital. Aid can also be used to further political ideologies. Aid should not be used as a way of getting countries to “behave,” as some may argue.
Dambisa Moyo, Zambian-born economist and author of “Dead Aid,” makes the point that direct foreign investment, not aid, is the key to economic success. She notes that Malawi, Burundi, and Burkina Faso all had higher per capita incomes than China just 30 years ago. Now China has exponentially higher human capital due to foreign investment, while the economies of the other three countries remain stagnant. They have become “black holes” of foreign aid that fuel rampant corruption.
Even aid for natural disaster relief is problematic, although arguably of the most immediate importance. Moyo notes that nine months after the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, the charitable organization World Vision “had spent less than a quarter of the $100 million it had raised” due to institutional inefficiencies and a lack of trustworthy organizations to donate to. 
 
Regardless, whether one believes in the effectiveness of aid or not, aid will not be effective if there is no implementation infrastructure and human capital training to match the donated gift. I saw this myself when I was teaching in Eenhana, Namibia two years ago. I saw brand new Dell computers unassembled and collecting dust. The computers had been donated to the school without any research into the community, let alone instructions on how to set them up and use them. Imagine the misuse of funds that could occur on a larger scale.
Even before the 2010 earthquake struck, Haiti relied on nongovernmental organizations for support. But after the earthquake, there were 12,000 NGOs operating in Haiti, and yet only around 10 percent of the funds allocated for Haiti's recovery had been spent by January 2011. The reconstruction of Haiti could have provided an opportunity for job creation within the country, yet only 20 out of the 1,500 aid contracts given out in the year after the earthquake went to Haitian-owned companies.
 
On a large scale, it is important that developed countries adopt policies that promote trade with and investment in the resources and human capital of developing countries. On an individual scale, if you are inclined to donate to an international charity this holiday season, I recommend doing a bit of research to find an organization that trains and educates the local population and fosters economic growth and on-the-ground sustainability.

Last Spring, I put on the hijab. For one week, I woke up every morning, and despite the fact that the sun had only just remembered to shine and most Harvard students were shedding their clothes, I pinned a scarf to my head and dressed myself so that nothing but my face and hands were bare. I was in a typical costume for a Muslim woman in the West, if there is in fact such a thing, except for one detail. Instead of the regular bonnet that is worn to keep hair neat and hidden under the veil, I tied a do-rag around my head because CVS keeps do-rags in stock and not bonnets for Muslims.
In some ways I was trying to put myself in the shoes of a Muslim woman in the West who chose to wear the hijab. Of course, there were many limitations to this project, and wearing the headscarf by my own choice for the short span of a week only presented a small set of data relative to the general experience of a person in that position. But in any case, this was not a complete description of what I was trying to accomplish. I had been intrigued by something so simple as a piece of cloth.
The hijab has been used as a symbol of nationalism in countries other than this one and as a symbol of oppression in countries including this one. Encompassed in this scarf, tied this way, are powerful ideas of faith, piety and identity: ideas I wanted to engage through simply playing with a piece of cloth. As a child puts a toy in her mouth in order to know it better, I put the scarf on my head to come as viscerally close as I could to understanding this symbol.
Under those terms, this was a successful experiment. When it came to external experiences with the hijab, as in dealing with other people’s reactions to it or the functionality of wearing it, I had a wide array of reactions and a few surprising discoveries. The general public, the Harvard student body, and acquaintances seemed to treat me with a greater degree of respect. I felt as if I was wearing my Sunday best all the time and enjoyed the experience of better service in stores and more doors held open for me. Amongst my close friends, the reactions were split. Some practically forgot that I was wearing the headscarf at all. Kind as they are to excuse me when I live in my sweatpants, they extended the same courtesy of nonchalance to my new headdress. Others were very supportive, and told me that they thought it looked attractive. For a few people, it proved to be a very uncomfortable and disconcerting experience. My suspicion is that although they are ordinarily quite used to interacting with people who are obviously different from them, they approach those people at arm’s length and do not see them as people that they can expect to relate to or understand. When I wore the headscarf as somebody that they did relate closely to and expected to understand, traversing the distance between foreign stranger and well-known friend was an unexpectedly side chasm to bridge.
But it was also very interesting to notice the internal changes that occurred within me as a result of wearing the hijab. More than one person pointed out to me that my mannerisms had become more subdued and more noticeably demure and feminine. For instance, I spoke in a softer tone, always sat with my legs crossed and kept my hands clasped in front of me when I spoke. Particularly on the first day of wearing the hijab, I felt as if I was wearing a protective blanket. On one hand it gave me a sense of security, and on the other hand the shielding effect of the hijab was only an illusion because the act of wearing it made such a strong statement that I was in fact exposing a more vulnerable part of myself. My vulnerability was also more profound because I had little control over the strong statement that I was broadcasting, since it would have been interpreted differently by each observer.
Wearing the hijab taught me a lot about the ways through which we construct and express our identity. I also gained a deeper understanding of how we perceive each other and how minute changes can be experienced as earth-shaking in our subjective contexts. I wondered at the outset if this weeklong experiment would change my opinions on the veil or give me some insight into Islam or American culture, but instead I learned far more about myself and about the people who share my life with me. In the movie Dead Poets Society, the teacher John Keating jumps onto the teacher’s desk and asks his students “Why do I stand up here? Anybody?” Some are horrified at his behavior, some chuckle and some call him crazy. “No!” he shouts, “I stand upon my desk to remind myself that we must constantly look at things in a different way.” In a similar way, I realize that I had covered myself in order to step outside my own experience, only to understand it better.

Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday, and many among us were fortunate to spend it with friends, family, good food, and warm fires. As the legend goes, the harvest of 1621 in nearby Plymouth was bountiful, in no small part due to Squanto, a young Wampanoag man who taught the Pilgrims to fish and grow corn. In celebration, the Wampanoag and the Pilgrims had a Thanksgiving feast together to strengthen their friendship and enjoy their harvest.
The holiday celebrates a few key American principles: that great rewards can be achieved through hard work, that celebration can be a wonderful bond between friends and family, and that two dissimilar groups of people can achieve more together than they can separately. For many of these reasons, President Abraham Lincoln officially established Thanksgiving as a national holiday to renew the bonds of friendship between the Union and the Confederacy during the Civil War.
But just as the holiday marks some of our greatest strengths, it also serves as a reminder of some of our greatest shortcomings. While the original Thanksgiving feast was a testament to the bond between Native Americans and colonists, the next few centuries were continuously marred by war, forced relocation, and disenfranchisement. Today, 14.9 percent of Native Americans have neither a high school diploma nor a GED by age 24. Over 58 percent of Native American women face physical or sexual violence in their lifetime, compared with the national average of 35.6 percent. Finally, Native American preventable deaths due to alcoholism are 627 percent higher, due to suicide 72 percent higher, and due to accidents 204 percent higher than the national average. I say this not to admonish our country, but rather as a patriotic American. It’s just as much our duty to remember our wrongs, learn from them, and attempt to right them as it is to build on our strengths. Some of the brightest hopes for the future lie in a several Native American leaders who seek to better their communities and the country through science and education.
I have had the great pleasure of speaking with Commander John B. Herrington, the first enrolled member of a Native American tribe to fly in space. Commander Herrington was selected with the 16th class of astronauts in 1996 and served as a Mission Specialist on STS-113. He additionally has clocked in over 4,500 hours of flight time and served as commander of the NEEMO 6 underwater mission. He retired from the Astronaut Corps in 2005 and is currently completing a Ph.D. at the University of Idaho, studying how to motivate kids in math and science education through experiential learning. Despite an incredible résumé, Commander Herrington was kind and humble, and his story was instantly relatable.
Commander Herrington described entering college as the first in his family, studying biology and chemistry but spending much of his time in the outdoors and rock climbing. He was suspended for low grades and returned home to work on a surveying crew. As a skilled rock climber, he was put to work ascending and descending cliffs, where he held a prism that reflected an infrared beam of light emanating from a survey instrument near the base of the cliff.
His job involved subjects that had bored him in school, like physics and trigonometry, and gave them a direct application that made them understandable and useful to learn. With great encouragement from his supervisor, he returned to school with a renewed appreciation for learning and got top marks the second time around. Herrington even ended up becoming a math tutor for a retired naval aviator, who encouraged him to apply to Officer Candidate School to become a naval officer. He returned to school to get a master’s in aeronautical engineering and was accepted to the Astronaut Corps. From humble beginnings suspended from on the side of a cliff, Commander Herrington performed three space walks suspended over 200 miles above Earth.
Commander Herrington achieves incredible heights and was originally motivated to do so not in the classroom, but outdoors learning through experience. His goal is to provide young students of today with the same opportunities he had, to motivate them to careers in math and science through experience. His doctoral research will investigate the effectiveness of using experiential education to motivate Native American students to take courses in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. He believes that Native American cultural values of intrinsic learning, storytelling, and learning through collaboration rather than competition are keys to effective learning.
There are countless other Native leaders in science and education, and I could write a column for each. While native communities have made great progress towards equal opportunity, there is still much work left to be done, and it is everyone’s responsibility to work toward a future in which all have an equal opportunity for success. Much of that gap can be closed with a strong focus on science and education. Four hundred years ago, Squanto educated the Pilgrims in agriculture so that they could live and eventually turn this region into the most thriving center of education and innovation in the world. Today, Commander Herrington is one of many incredible Native American leaders who are using science and education to transform the native community and the United States, and that is something we can all be thankful for.

UPDATED: Nov. 27, 2012, at 11:56 p.m.
While a number of colleges have expressed enthusiasm at the overwhelming Harvard student support for the divestment of the University’s endowment from the fossil fuel industry, many student leaders also voiced concern at the Harvard administration’s silence on the issue.
More than 70 percent of the roughly 3,600 Harvard undergraduates who cast ballots in the Undergraduate Council presidential election voted in favor of a referendum calling for divestment of Harvard’s $30.7 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry, adding Harvard’s name to a slew of similar campaigns at other colleges.
“We are so excited that Harvard and so many other schools have joined the movement. In particular, we were thrilled to hear that 72% of the Harvard student body supported the referendum,” Sachie Hopkins-Hayakawa, an organizer of the fossil fuel divestment campaign at Swarthmore College, wrote in an email.
But despite such immense student support, the Harvard administration said last week that it is “not considering” divestment, and student attempts to meet University President Drew G. Faust to discuss the issue have been unsuccessful thus far.
“It’s two-and-a-half weeks that we’ve been waiting for a response—and we sent reminder emails,” said Alli J. Welton '15, a board member of Divest Harvard, the student organization that championed the referendum.
Student leaders at other schools said their administrators have been much more receptive to student divestment campaigns.
“Honestly it’s terrible that the [Harvard] administration is refusing to [discuss the issue] considering that there are students that are really concerned about it,” said Catherine E. Martin, an organizer of the fossil fuel divestment movement at Syracuse University. She added that the Syracuse administration has been “very willing” to work with students—the chancellor formed a committee of five trustees to evaluate the college’s investments after students inquired about investment in fossil fuels.
Amherst College’s administration has also been “very willing” to engage in dialogue, said Deidre Nelms, who is spearheading fossil fuel divestment efforts there as president of the Green Amherst Project.
Amherst administrators will likely vote in January whether or not to divest from the coal industry, and a robust campaign at Harvard could influence the outcome.
“They’d be more likely to divest if other colleges were actively pursuing it as well,” said Nelms. “Keep protesting, and try to make the issue as high profile as possible, because people pay attention to what people do at Harvard.”
Martin echoed Nelms’ words of advice and is optimistic that the Harvard administration will not be able to ignore divestment if student involvement in Divest Harvard accelerates. “If people are even vaguely interested they need to go out and support [the campaign] because change isn’t easy,” she said. “If you want to get involved don’t think somebody else is going to take care of it for you—make sure your voice is heard.”
The nationwide environmental initiative was catalyzed in large part by environmental author and activist Bill E. McKibben '82’s ‘Do the Math’ tour, in which the former Crimson president traveled to dozens of university campuses to encourage investment in sustainable energy rather than fossil fuels.
This article has been updated to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: Nov. 27
An earlier version of this article stated that more than 70 percent of undergraduates voted in favor of a referendum calling for Harvard to divest from the fossil fuel industry. To clarify, that number refers to the 72 percent of the roughly 3,600 students who voted in the Undergraduate Council presidential election who supported the referendum.

“Funny Ha Ha,” the critically acclaimed film by Andrew J. Bujalski ’98, starts and ends on a low note.
The film, which screened at the Harvard Film Archive on Thursday in honor of its 10th anniversary, opens with the protagonist—a twenty-four-year old woman named Marnie—drunkenly wandering into a tattoo parlor only to be denied service by a benevolent tattoo artist. The film ends with a picnic between Marnie and her recently-married best friend Alex, for whom she has harbored unrequited amorous feelings.
Bujalski, who graduated with a degree from the College in Visual and Environmental Studies, said during a discussion after the film screening that his studies at Harvard had a significant impact on his filmmaking style. In particular, he said, the emphasis on documentary film in Harvard’s VES department shaped the way that he thinks about creating movies.
“I think of narrative filmmaking as some sort of strange form of documentary and myself as a documentarian who’s too lazy to follow people around,” Bujalski said before a packed room at the Harvard Film Archive.
The film, which first came out in 2002, bears traces of Bujalski’s time at Harvard. Parts of the movie were filmed across the river in Allston and, according to the director, about a third of the cast graduated from the University.
Bujalski said he prefers to create movies that leave the audience grappling with loose ends.
“I never want to situate the audience,” Bujalski said. “I always want you guys to find your own way into it.”
Since graduating from Harvard, Bujalski has directed four films professionally. Funny Ha Ha was Bujalki’s debut project.
Critics have placed Funny Ha Ha into the mumblecore subgenre of independent films, a category characterized by non-professional acting and colloquial dialog.
But, during the discussion, Bujalski said he hesitates to accept the mumblecore label for his film.
“I have this strange dissociation from the word mumblecore,” Bujalski said. “I read that word in the New York Times...and I don’t really see my work as fitting that label.”
Thursday’s screening drew a group of viewers from beyond the Harvard bubble that ranged from Cambridge residents to members of the film industry.
Saul Levine, an experimental filmmaker at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, said that he enjoyed watching the film despite his usual aversion to the mumblecore genre.
“It’s not so characteristic of mumblecore which often is sentimental,” Levine said. “It delivers on the irony and anger that I think many of the other films [in the genre] want but don’t quite get together.”
Bujalski said he has found it fascinating to observe how people react to his work, which he called “unconventional.”
“I never people getting frustrated and w imagined alking out,” said Bujualski. “I never thought it was possible until it happened.”

In 1620, a nobleman and a nun in Florence, Italy, were accused of having an affair and charged with adultery. When asked to explain their relationship, the two responded consistently. They claimed that the nobleman had sneaked into the nun’s apartment to hear her sing, not because of a sexual relationship.
New York University professor and musicologist Suzanne G. Cusick shared this story in a Monday afternoon lecture, in which she explored both the history of the Florence scandal and the interplay of music and sexuality—what Cusick described as an “erotic economy of song.” The lecture was the second event in “The Barwick Student Colloquium Series,” a new speaker series organized by the Harvard music department to showcase the work of music scholars. The series selects speakers based on graduate student and faculty nominations.
In her talk, Cusick said her work, which she read aloud, approaches the field of sound studies from two new directions: historical and gender perspectives.
“There is almost nothing that brings the discourse of sound studies into conversations about gender studies,” Cusick said in an interview with The Crimson. “This project does both of those things. It’s possible to bring both feminist and queer theory discourse to bear on these documents.”
Cusick’s study of the scandal relates back to her previous work on gender and sexuality and the role of music in torture, two research topics for which she is known. Cusick was an “immensely popular” choice, according to music department chair Alexander Rehding.
“We’re trying to bring in fantastic scholars whose work is interesting and speaks to a broad number of scholars, graduates, and faculty,” Rehding said. “I think it’s her mixture of very interesting topics that are not often tackled within musicology that is so attractive to our community.”
Music professor Suzannah E. Clark said she appreciated the potential for the new series to introduce students to scholars like Cusick.
“[We want] to give these kinds of opportunities to grad students to meet illustrious scholars, such as Suzanne Cusick, and to hear the voice behind the scholarship,” Clark said. “It’s interesting that she’s talking today about listening to the documents, and what we do as scholars in colloquialism is listen to people reading their work.”
“That gives a kind of inflection into their work that adds a dimension that you don’t get yourself,” she added.

Former president of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed speaks without equivocation in the film “The Island President,” screened at Harvard Law School early Monday evening. Climate change is “the most important fight is the fight for our survival,” he says in the film.
The screening of the documentary was the focal point of an event sponsored by the Program on Negotiation, the Environmental Law Program at the Law School and the Harvard Law Documentary Studio. The film depicts the first year of Nasheed’s term in office and traces his handling of administrative issues of pressing importance to his island nation, most notably climate change.
In particular, the documentary follows Nasheed’s ascent onto the international stage as he recruits support for carbon emission reductions. His policy goals aimed to prevent a dramatic rise in the sea level and, therefore, ensure the survival of the Maldives, a low-lying country made of more than 1,300 islands.
The film spotlighted Nasheed’s struggle to garner international support for the inclusion of specific environmental precautions in the Copenhagen Accord, a climate change agreement drafted during the 2009 United Nations Climate Conference. Nasheed appealed to other developing nations and compromised with the project’s primary opponents—China and India—to incorporate successfully clauses that limited the global temperature increase to less than two degrees and atmospheric carbon concentration to 350 parts per million by 2012. But since 2009, carbon emissions have increased dramatically, and Nasheed was forced to resign from the presidency earlier this year to avoid a violent military overthrow from allies of the previous president.
Viewers also were invited to partake in a post-screening discussion of the documentary, led by senior advisor of the International Center on Nonviolent Conflict, Hardy Merriman. Audience members delved into the political climate of Nasheed’s administration, including details leading up to the coup d’etat that eventually led Nasheed to step down from office. They also discussed the economic feasibility of transforming the Maldives into a carbon-neutral nation.
Susan Hackley, managing director of the Program on Negotiation at HLS, said that she thought the documentary was successful in emphasizing the need for immediate environmental awareness. “What Nasheed does so wonderfully is make things visible through his talking,” Hackley said. “With climate change, one of the things to do is make things visible and affect people.”

A new device invented at Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will absorb unprecedented levels of infrared light, expanding possibilities for thermal detection and energy harvesting.
The instrument, designed by ten collaborators from SEAS and the  University of California, San Diego, consists of just 180 nanometers of vanadium dioxide layered on a sheet of sapphire. When tuned to the right temperature, it can absorb an almost "perfect" 99.75 percent of infrared light—a feat that has earned it the name Tunable Perfect Absorber, said SEAS graduate student Mikhail A. Kats, lead author of the paper that announced the invention.
Although previous devices have achieved infrared absorption also, the Absorber has a unique mechanism for tuning to different temperatures. Researchers can now control the temperature of the device and its resulting properties. For example, the Absorber acts as an insulator at low temperatures, while at high temperatures it behaves more like a metal and absorbs less light.
About halfway between these temperature extremes, the device absorbs a maximum amount of infrared light.
“We were fortunate in the magnitude effect that we achieved,” said Kats. He added that the 99 percent absorption rate significantly exceeded his expectations of 20 percent absorption.
“We expected to see a small change and we ended up seeing a huge change,” he said. “To some extent it was serendipitous that we tested this structure on the right substrate that enhanced these effects.”
Harvard’s Office of Technology Development is currently filing for patent applications and pursuing commercial licensing for the invention, which has been two-and-a-half years in the making.
“We haven’t yet made something that is in the final stage of being used commercially,” Kats said. “However, I think that it has very significant implications for anywhere where infrared light is to be detected.”
The Absorber’s applications could vary widely, Kats added—from improving infrared cameras and thermal imaging devices to detecting radiation and controlling laser output. Each use will capitalize on the device’s improved sensitivity for infrared detection and imaging.
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Office of Naval Research, and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research were among the agencies that supported researchers involved in the project.
The invention was featured in the journal of Applied Physics Letters Monday.

When the clock ran down in the fourth quarter and students poured out of the stands and onto the field after Harvard defeated Yale in The Game on Nov. 17, senior defensive tackle Adam Riegel rejoiced at midfield with the rest of his jubilant teammates.
Although the team celebrated the victory together, Riegel’s path to that moment was one that few teammates on the over-100 man roster shared. While the vast majority of the football team was recruited to play at Harvard, Riegel—and roughly 11 other players, according to his estimate—walked on to the team over the past four years.
Once the walk-ons have successfully made it onto the roster, they are treated like any other member of the team. During the fall season, every player endures two-a-days composed of early morning lifts and long afternoon practices, and training stretches on throughout the winter and spring.
But walk-ons such as Riegel cannot expect to receive much playing time, and they often end up spending the vast majority of seasons on the sideline. Riegel has been an exception and has seen a decent amount of action, as he appeared in the final six games of last season and every game this year. But before his junior year, Riegel only appeared at the very end of two blowouts, an allotment more typical for a football walk-on.
Even though the walk-ons may not contribute as much as the team’s highly recruited players on the field, players such as Riegel nevertheless hold an important position on the team.
“The walk-ons are guys that probably are respected as much or more than any of the other guys simply because they weren’t recruited, they have not been the marquee players, and yet they come to work every day with pride,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I think you appreciate those guys as much or more than our highly recruited guys who are great All-Ivy caliber players.”
For Riegel, his four years on the team have been part of a long journey, one he believes was still worth all the time and effort.
“I wanted to see how far I could push myself and how good I could be football-wise, and that’s exactly what [the program] has given me the opportunity to do,” Riegel said. “Competing with the best competition in 1-AA and really challenging myself and being part of a winning program…. I have nothing but great things to say of my experience.”
ROAD TO HARVARD FOOTBALL
Riegel played high school football less than an hour from Cambridge at Walpole High School in Walpole, Mass. Playing on both the offensive and defensive lines, Riegel served as captain his senior year and guided the team to an undefeated 13-0 record to finish second in the state.
The lineman was in contact with several Division III schools, mainly in the NESCAC, during the recruiting process throughout his junior and senior years in high school.
But once Riegel was admitted to Harvard in the normal spring admissions process, he knew he wanted to come to Cambridge and join the Crimson football team.
“When I came in to talk to the coaches about walking on in my senior spring [of high school], I went in and met with Coach Murphy, and he was very honest,” Riegel said. “[Murphy told me that] very few walk-ons come here and play, and it’s a very long road. And that really made sense to me.”
Since the roster was under capacity during Riegel’s first year, he did not have to go through the normal tryout process of drills and sprints that is typical for prospective walk-ons. As he had already provided the coaches with his recruiting tape, Riegel was offered a spot at the preseason camp.
According to Riegel, a total of five players walked on to the team his freshman season. Three of those players stuck with the program all four years: Riegel, and senior offensive linemen Jim Deng and Chase Sippel.
A MEMBER OF THE CRIMSON
Playing time for most Harvard football players is hard to come by during their first few seasons on the team, but it is even harder for walk-ons to see action, let alone for more than just a few plays.
“Obviously pride-wise, I thought I was capable of playing here, but I also grasped the notion that there were guys who were recruited ahead of me,” Riegel said. “I knew I had that much more work to do. So I really always took that mentality of, I needed to do that much work to get to where those guys were, and if I wanted to play, be above them.”
Indeed, since Riegel started near the bottom of the depth chart, he knew he needed to grasp the details of the playbook, work hard in the weight room, and contribute positively during practice to see significant time on the field.
When Riegel received the opportunity to play in the fifth game of the 2011-12 season against Bucknell, the then-junior took advantage. He made perhaps his play of the year against the Bison, deflecting a pass from Bucknell quarterback Brandon Wesley that resulted in an interception in the Crimson’s emphatic 42-3 win.
Following that victory, Riegel played in each of the team’s remaining five games.
“I’d been ready, and I was able to perform up to expectations and really help the team out,” Riegel said. “I think that’s my biggest role, is always being ready and helping the guys around me when I am in. Some of the younger guys have worlds of talent but might not always understand the intricacies, [so I make] sure they’re doing everything right so they can go make plays.”
But even in their senior years, most walk-ons still do not see significant time on the field. Although he did appear in every game, Riegel was credited with only six tackles on the season.
LOOKING BACK AND LOOKING FORWARD
In his four years at Harvard, the defensive tackle—who, following graduation, plans to pursue a job in finance—has been part of a football program that captured one Ivy League Championship and emerged victorious from the Harvard-Yale matchup all four times.
Even though Riegel never played as large of a role on the field as some of his recruited teammates, he has contributed to the team in a unique way and remains an integral part of the program.
“You just can’t say enough good things about [Riegel], how highly respected he is by our football team,” Murphy said. “He’d probably be the first guy we’d hire if we were hiring somebody…. He’s as humble as they come, and he’s just so important to the fabric and dynamic of our team in almost an unexplainable way.”
If Riegel had gravitated toward some of the smaller, Division III schools that recruited him in high school, there is no doubt that his college football experience would have been filled with much more time on the gridiron.
But Riegel harbors no regrets about his decision to come to Harvard and play football for a large program under the direction of Murphy.
“I think [this experience has] just been really formative for me,” Riegel said. “It’s really taught me a lot about myself. I think coming to Harvard as opposed to going to some of my other options was really choosing to be a small fish in a big pond, as opposed to a big fish in a small pond, and I think that’s really helped me develop a lot of my skills to make me the person that I am today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A victory against Cornell had eluded the Crimson women’s hockey team for almost four years, a drought dating back to the end of 2008. The Big Red has held undisputed top-dog position in the ECAC conference since then, with three championships in the last three years.
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey and the other Harvard seniors had never beaten Cornell.
The Crimson has always seemed one step behind the Big Red; they came in second to the Big Red in consecutive seasons, dropping close games each year.
From the outset, it seemed like the 2012 season was destined to continue down the same path, as Cornell came into the year as the pick to repeat as conference champs and is currently nationally ranked at No. 2, right behind University of Minnesota.
But the trend would not continue this year, as Dempsey led her team to its first victory over Cornell in her career.
The 3-1 win came on a day when Big Red’s national ranking meant nothing, as it was outplayed and outgunned by a stronger Harvard squad.
“This was the one year, more than any year past, where I truly, truly believed that we had the talent and teamwork to do this,” Dempsey said. “If there was any doubt prior to the Cornell game that we were a good team, they’re all gone now because of the way we played. We know now what we’re capable of if we show up and play really hard and really well.”
Dempsey was directly responsible for a lot of the momentum that finally put the losing streak to an end. After only two minutes of playing time, the co-captain was able to get in front of goal after a scramble and nudge the puck past Cornell goaltender Lauren Slebodnick to put Harvard ahead early.
At the beginning of the third period, Dempsey strung a pass to teammate Kalley Armstrong on a breakaway to put the game at 2-1. Lots of forechecking and backchecking on both sides of the puck helped keep the Big Red from gaining momentum and staging a comeback.
“She’s the most consistent player on our team,” said teammate and fellow co-captain Laura Bellamy. “And she always brings it in. She brought it for the most important game of our season so far and definitely helped lead us to victory on Saturday. There’s really not much else we could ask from her at this point.”
The 2012 Patty Kazmaier Award nominee and ECAC first team selection was similarly impressive earlier in the weekend, when she tallied two assists to help put Harvard up, 4-1, over conference foes Colgate. With the two wins over the weekend, the Crimson advanced to 6-0 in conference play.
“[Dempsey] is the catalyst of our offense,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She works so hard, she’s relentless, and she sets the tone for how things happen offensively.”
Dempsey played for the Team USA under-22 squad this summer in a best-of-three against Team Canada, which the USA swept.
The co-captain is able to bring that experience and leadership from a higher level of competitive play to the college team.
Dempsey currently sits with seven goals and eight assists in only seven games played and holds a team-high 15 points. Her +12 plus/minus on the ice is not only the best on team, but good enough for third-best in the league.
Impressive stat numbers are nothing new to Dempsey, who shined similarly last year as a junior. In 30 games played, the co-captain scored 27 goals with 21 assists and averaged a team-best 1.6 points per game. Her .9 goals-per-game average was sixth best in the country.
“I think [Dempsey] has improved steadily every year, and she keeps adding to her game,” Stone said. “She made a couple of huge defensive plays on Saturday night against Cornell, she backchecked hard, [and] played well offensively…. Things like that, the different pieces of her game, continue to improve and she continues to become a better player.”
Dempsey says it’s easy to work hard for her teammates and school when the motivation comes naturally.
“The one place I really want to be is on the ice, either at the rink or training for it,” she said. “I honestly love it so much, and that’s why I’m so motivated to keep training for it. It’s definitely going to have to be a part of my life, in one way or another, for as long as I can.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off a 19-point loss at St. Joseph’s on Nov. 20, the Harvard men’s basketball team will look to bounce back on Tuesday night at Lavietes Pavilion against Vermont.
When the Crimson visited the Catamounts (3-1, 1-0 America East) a season ago, Harvard entered with an undefeated record. The Crimson topped Vermont, 55-48, and went on to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946.
But this year, the situation is different. The Crimson (2-2) comes into the game with a .500 record and a much less experienced lineup. Harvard, which starts no seniors and a rookie point guard, will face a Vermont squad that starts four juniors.
The Catamounts are led by junior Brian Voelkel, a forward who leads the team in assists and rebounding. Although undersized, the 6’6” forward is a tenacious rebounder.
The America East’s leading rebounder a season ago, Voelkel has continued to pace the Catamounts with 8.3 of the team’s 37 boards per game.
Vermont, however, features a very balanced offense with no player averaging more than 10 points per game. Their leading scorer is junior guard Candon Rusin who averages 9.8 points per game.
“[Vermont] has always had a team that’s tough and physical,” Amaker said. “Voelkel is difficult matchup for us…. They run an offense with a lot of players that would post up. They will invert a lot, having the guards post up, and the forwards on the outside. We have to play good post defense.”
The Crimson averages only 35.6 rebounds per game, 164th in Division I. In fact, its leading rebounder is sophomore Wesley Saunders, a perimeter player.
In their last game, the Catamounts defeated Yale, 65-52, dominating on the glass. Their only loss on the season is to perennial Big East power UConn. The defending America East champs are riding a two-game winning streak into Cambridge.
Harvard on the other hand, dealing with the loss of captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry, has experienced growing pains while integrating new players into their system.
One such player is freshman Siyani Chambers, who has averaged 9.8 points and 4.8 assists per game in four starts.
“We’ve been really, really impressed with the progress of…Chambers,” said junior co-captain Laurent Rivard. “He had really good games against UMass and Manhattan.”
Sophomore Wesley Saunders has led the Crimson in scoring averaging 14.3 points per game. Saunders put up 18 in the loss to St. Joseph’s.
Rivard, the lone returning starter from last year’s NCAA tournament team, has averaged 11.8 points per game, mainly stemming from his lights out shooting. Rivard has a 46.2 three-point field goal percentage.
But last Tuesday, Rivard and the Crimson struggled from beyond the arc. Harvard did not connect on a three-pointer in the first half and fell into a deep hole early and could not find its way out of it en route to the loss.
“[There’s] not a lot of margin of error for us this year, and certainly on the road against a very good team,” Amaker said about the loss.
One area the coach said the team could improve against Vermont was turnovers. The Crimson coughed up the ball 18 times in the game. Chambers had five turnovers alone. Yet Amaker was not worried about the freshman’s progress.
“In the two games we have lost so far, the turnovers have been really harmful and something that has just wiped us out,” Amaker said. “With the amount of minutes [Chambers] is playing, he is not going to be able to have only zero or one turnovers most games.”
In the wins against MIT and Manhattan, Chambers was able to hold his turnovers down, committing only two in each.
If the rookie and the rest of the team can turn in a similarly strong performance on Tuesday, it will put the young Crimson in position to take down an experienced Vermont team and bode well for Harvard’s progress.
“We just need to come out aggressive and have no mental lapses,” sophomore Jonah Travis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women's hockey co-captain Jillian Dempsey may have earned the spot as The Crimson's Athlete of the Week this time around, but two Crimson standouts from this past weekend have also secured bragging rights.
CHRISTINE CLARK, WOMEN’S BASKETBALL
Clark has consistently been an offensive threat in each of the Harvard's contests this season and is currently averaging 19 points per game. The junior guard from Tuscan, Ariz. dominated the court this weekend against Michigan and Eastern Michigan, scoring 23 and 16 points, respectively. Clark leads the offense, registering 114 points in the last six games. The guard also has totaled 17 assists and 12 steals.
EMERANCE MASCHMEYER, WOMEN’S ICE HOCKEY
After snagging the title of Athlete of the Week on Nov. 6, Maschmeyer makes her first appearance on the Runners Up list after an impressive performance that helped secure the Harvard women's hockey team's win against Cornell, 3-1, this past Saturday. The freshman goalie registered 21 saves against the Big Red, adding to her career total of 49 saves over the span of her three starts this season. Maschmeyer has only allowed two goals against and has a staggering save percentage of .961.

That subject-less email you received today from registration@worldapp.com may have looked a lot like spam. But luckily for those who clicked on the link for the "2012-2013 Harvard College House Life Survey" that it contained, it was actually from the Office of Student Life.
Beth Musser, assistant to the resident dean of Cabot House, sent Cabot residents an email explaining the message. She wrote, "The people launching the House Life Survey are having technical  difficulties ('including this weirdo not real launch of the survey') and  they will be sending you an email that doesn't look like sketchy SPAM  later on this afternoon."
Indeed, within 20 minutes of being sent out, the survey was made inactive, and the following message was posted: "Sorry! Thank you for being willing to participate in this survey. This survey is now inactive. We appreciate your consideration."
Nicely done, OSL.

Okay, we know it's a little after Thanksgiving. But this video of how some Harvard students spent the holiday while on campus is nothing short of cute. And who couldn't use a little more cute in their lives?

It seems like someone in New Jersey is still disappointed they didn't get into Harvard. Fortunately, all those tigers who are licking their academic wounds from last semester can take comfort in a new website that purports to convert Princeton students' GPAs into slightly higher Harvard equivalents. Flyby can only assume that the site was generously created by a Princetonian hoping to fuel his classmates' fantasies about how much better their lives would have been had they gone to Harvard instead.
Although the site was uploaded anonymously, a FAQ explains that the converter works by "aligning GPA's between the two universities by percentile so the median GPA at Princeton will return the median GPA at Harvard, the 90th percentile GPA at Princeton will return the 90th percentile GPA at Harvard, etc." Fiddling around with different values in the converter revealed that the maximum GPA increase was 0.16 points (not exactly a PBK-worthy boost).
While Flyby finds it admirable that some enterprising soul took it upon himself to support others' daydreams of Crimson glory, we can't help but think his or her time may have been better spent filling out a transfer application.
