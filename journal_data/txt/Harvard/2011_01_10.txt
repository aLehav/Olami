After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Updated at 4:45 p.m. 1/10/2011.
Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords asked newly-appointed Institute of Politics director C. M. Trey Grayson '94 for help in toning down heated political rhetoric hours before she was severely wounded in a shooting rampage in Tucson that killed six people and left a dozen others injured.
Giffords sent Grayson an e-mail on Friday to congratulate him on his appointment as director of the IOP, adding she wanted to discuss with him ways to calm political acrimony in her area.
"After you get settled, I would love to talk about what we can do to promote centrism and moderation. I am one of only 12 Dems left in a GOP district (the only woman) and think that we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down," Giffords wrote.
Although the alleged shooter’s motive remains unclear, Satuday’s shooting has led many to wonder whether vitriolic political rhetoric and exaggerated partisanship in American politics could have indirectly prompted the alleged shooter to target the congresswoman.
In an interview Monday, Grayson said he does not currently see a connection between Giffords’ e-mail, political partisanship, and the shooting.
He said he has frequently spoken to Giffords about their will to promote bipartisanship and moderation in politics.
"But even if there is no connection, I see this tragedy as an opportunity to improve the tone of our rhetoric," he said. "We need to be careful about how we pursue [politics]. There are consequences."
Both Grayson and Giffords ran against candidates affiliated with the populist Tea Party movement during their November campaigns. While Giffords, a Democrat, managed to hang on to her seat in the House of Representatives, Grayson lost his Republican Senate primary to Tea Party darling Rand Paul, who went on to win in the general election.
The Tea Party has been widely credited with Republican gains during the mid-term elections but have also been viewed as a source of increased polarization in American politics. Some commentators have speculated in the aftermath of the shooting that such polarization—and its concomitant aggressive rhetoric on both sides of the aisle—could have played a role in Saturday’s shooting.
“I can’t believe how poignant this is in light of what just happened,” Grayson said, referring to the congresswoman’s e-mail.
Giffords and Grayson have known each other since they met as part of the Aspen Institute’s Rodel Fellowship for young leaders in 2005 and have stayed in touch ever since. In her congratulatory e-mail to Grayson, Giffords wrote she would visit him at Harvard later this year.
"When I got the email, I was so ecstatic that she was interested in coming up," Grayson said. "I was trying to think of a way to get her involved with the IOP."
Giffords also wrote she thought Grayson’s new position was "a perfect fit" for him, adding she had never forgotten the moments she spent at the Kennedy School where she took part in a state and local leader’s program as a member of the Arizona Senate.
Saturday’s shooting took place during a political gathering outside a grocery store in Tucson, Arizona. Giffords was shot in the head but survived while others—including a nine-year-old girl and a federal judge—were killed.
The main suspect, 22-year-old Jared Loughner, has been charged with five federal counts and is expected to appear in court Monday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a three-point shooting clinic yesterday afternoon at Lavietes Pavilion, as the Harvard women’s basketball team used its deadly range to take down a helpless NJIT squad.
The Crimson (7-6) matched its season-high 14 three-pointers—last achieved against Maine in the first game of the campaign—and shot 51.9 percent from beyond the arc to frustrate the Highlanders (3-10).
The final score, 76-64, suggests that the game was much closer than it actually was. At one point Harvard led by as many as 25 points, allowing coach Kathy Delaney-Smith to give almost the entire roster minutes on the court.
“We were not the underdogs,” Delaney-Smith said, “but we needed to have a better defensive effort at times. The start of the game and most of the first half I was pretty pleased with, but I thought we needed to get out to some of the threes a little more.”
NJIT also reached double digits in three-pointers made, hitting 10-of-29—six of which came in the second half. But it was all Harvard in the first period, led by point guard Brogan Berry.
The junior scored the first basket of the game, grabbing an offensive rebound and quickly putting the ball back up into the hoop. Berry spearheaded a confident Crimson squad, posting 16 points and adding five rebounds and six assists.
The visitors never got close after that basket. After a fruitless Highlander possession, Harvard sophomore Miriam Rutzen found senior Emma Markley inside for the easy layup.
NJIT once again failed to score, and co-captain Christine Matera punished the Highlanders with a shot from downtown.  NJIT coach Margaret McKeon had seen enough and called for a timeout.
The visitors still had no luck with their shots, and soon the ball was once again in the hands of Berry, who passed to Rutzen at the top of the arc for an open three, extending the lead to 10-0.
The Highlanders kept having troubles from close range, unable to make shots off the backboard. After two wasted NJIT possessions, freshman guard Christine Clark drained another three in the face of a defender.
Trailing by 13 with 14:52 left in the half, the Highlanders called for another respite.
“We had a really good game today,” Berry said. “After a tough loss to BC and putting a great effort there, we wanted to carry that effort and teamwork over. We really executed early in the game and got up early. Everybody came in to play, and it was a great team effort.”
Right out of the timeout, guard Jessica Gerald hit a trey for NJIT's first points of the contest. The senior guard was the game’s scoring leader, finishing with 25 points on 9-for-19 shooting.
But the Crimson kept lighting up the scoreboard, especially after sophomore Victoria Lippert came into the game. Lippert opened up her scoring with a shot from downtown, and on the following possession, she found sophomore guard Jasmine Evans for another three-pointer.
Harvard made 10 shots from beyond the arc in the first half, three of which came from Berry.
“We get up a lot of [three-point] shots in practice, so it’s nice when they start falling for us,” Lippert said. “We have a lot of deadly shooters—Brogan was hitting nicely, and Christine is deadly—and we like when those [shots] fall.”
NJIT had a small run of its own towards the end of the half, led by Gerald and guard Rayven Johnson, but the Crimson finished the half with a shot characteristic of the period. With five seconds remaining, Rutzen created enough space around her to shoot the trey and made it, setting the score at 43-26.
The large lead ballooned to 25 points in the second half, thanks to a quick start by Harvard.
Markley started the period with two baskets—one thanks to a nifty inside dish by Matera—and Berry controlled the tempo of the game, finding Clark for an open three and making a layup on a fast break off a miss by the Highlanders. Her basket made the score 56-31 with 16:14 left to play.
Given the luxury of a large lead, Delaney-Smith slowly incorporated her bench into the game. The coach gave her starters a well-deserved rest and allowed her substitutes to get some playing time.
"I played 15 players, and normally that’s tough to do,” Delaney-Smith said. “You don’t get a rhythm and a synergy. I was very happy with a lot of players I put in. Others didn’t appear to be quite ready, but again, they worked hard and they didn’t give up, so I’m pleased with today’s game."
Kimberly Dweck came alive in the second half for NJIT, finishing with 15 points. The visitors slowly chipped at the deficit but the final score would be the closest the Highlanders ever got.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Friday night’s contest with the Brown Bears, Harvard senior forward Michael Biega had only recorded two goals through his team’s first 12 games. Against the Ivy League foe, the senior had a career day, scoring three times to record his second career hat trick—the other coming in 2007, Biega’s freshman year.
But in a game in which goals tended to come in rapid bunches, Biega’s teammates were unable to muster any other offense against the Bears (5-6-4, 3-4-1 ECAC, 2-2-0 Ivy) and the Crimson (3-11-0, 2-9-0, 0-5-0) fell, 4-3.
Harvard lost despite controlling the game early, taking five shots before Brown was able to register one, which came 5:25 into the game.
“They’re a pretty physical team,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “So we wanted to come out with the same mentality and initiate contact with them.”
But the Crimson was unable to convert those shots into scores, and it was the Bears who earned the game’s first goal 7:21 into the second period. After a slashing penalty on junior Alex Killorn gave the Bears a power play, Brown sophomore Chris Zaires gathered the rebound off a shot by Mark Hourihan and tucked it into the right post before Harvard senior goaltender Ryan Carroll could get over for the game’s first goal.
Just 35 seconds later, Bears junior Bobby Farnham picked up the puck in the slot and sent a one-timer past Carroll to put Brown up 2-0.
“[Carroll] hadn’t played in a little bit, [so] it was good to get him in there,” sophomore forward Marshall Everson said. “He made every save he should have, and he gave us a chance to win.”
Biega then tied the game with two quick scores of his own. The forward took a cross-ice pass from Killorn on the left side and fired a one-timer over Brown freshman goaltender Marco De Filippo’s shoulder to make the score 2-1.
Just over a minute later, on a four-on-four, Biega took a pass from Killorn in the right slot during a two-on-one rush and put the puck past De Filippo to tie up the game. Sophomore—and brother—Danny Biega also assisted Michael’s first two goals.
“[Michael] had a great game,” Huxley said. “He’s one of our most skilled forwards and I think that showed on Friday.”
With just over two minutes remaining in the second period, the Crimson took advantage of a Brown penalty to take the lead on a power play. After junior Eric Kroshus had a shot from the left side of the zone blocked, Biega picked up the puck from the right circle, and, after waiting for De Filippo to commit, fired it past the Bears goalie to give Harvard the 3-2 lead.
“Mike had a big night Friday,” Everson said. “He just found soft areas in the defense, [and] guys were able to get him the puck. When he gets decent chances there’s no doubt about it; he’ll finish every time.”
But it was Brown that would control the final period. The Bears took advantage of a delayed penalty called on Crimson sophomore Brendan Rempel, who hit Brown freshman Garnet Hathaway at center ice. Seven minutes into the frame, with the Bears on a six-on-five advantage after pulling De Filippo, Hathaway made Harvard pay by scoring the game-tying goal.
As occurred multiple times throughout the evening, another score came soon after. Just 19 seconds later, Bears senior Harry Zolnierczyk beat Carroll to net the eventual game-winner.
“That goes back to our mistakes; we can’t commit penalties,” sophomore forward David Valek said. “I think at the beginning of the year we were one of the least penalized teams. I don’t know what’s going on right now.”
Harvard had a man advantage for the final minute-plus, but was unable to tally the tying score and fell for the ninth time in 10 games.
The teams were even in shots on the evening, with both squads taking 35. Biega and senior forward Pier-Olivier Michaud led the Crimson with four attempts each, while Zolnierczyk had six to pace Brown.
“We’re getting off track,” Valek said. “We just need to stick to the game plan, not really shift one way or another, and just keep playing the way we did that got us the lead.”
“I thought we were the better team most of that game,” Everson added. “Just to lose it, to not be able to close it out, is a tough feeling.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s not very often an Ivy League team is ranked No. 1 in a major college sport, and the Harvard men’s hockey team learned Saturday night why its rivals from Yale had earned such a distinction.
The Bulldogs (14-1-0, 8-0-0 ECAC, 4-0-0 Ivy) topped the Crimson (3-11-0, 2-9-0, 0-5-0) by a score of 4-2, with four different Yale players tallying goals in front of the sold-out crowd of 3,076 at Bright Hockey Center. Yale took advantage of seven Harvard penalties by scoring twice on power plays to earn the win, despite Crimson senior goaltender Ryan Carroll’s 35 saves.
“You don’t always get the chance to play the number one team in the country,” sophomore forward David Valek said. “Obviously we were really excited for the game. Going in we knew we could play with them; it was just about sticking to our gameplan, playing hard, and being tough mentally and physically.”
Neither team scored in the opening frame. Senior forward Michael Biega had Harvard’s best chance on a power play, but his shot from the right deflected off Yale senior goalie Ryan Rondeau’s leg and went wide. The Bulldogs had a good look later in the period, but Carroll denied forward Broc Little’s attempt from point-blank range.
“[Carroll] hasn’t had a lot of opportunities to play but when he does he plays well,” co-captain Chris Huxley said. “He made a lot of big saves look easy.”
Yale got the scoring started early in the second period by netting two goals in a span of 48 seconds. Two minutes and 57 seconds into the frame, freshman Kenny Agostino put back the rebound of a long shot from teammate Josh Baich to give the Bulldogs the 1-0 advantage.
Fifteen seconds later, Harvard sophomore Danny Biega was called for tripping, and Yale made its hosts pay when senior Chris Cahill sent a slap shot over Carroll’s left shoulder after a rush up the left side.
“They have a different lineup [than most teams] with more skilled guys,” Huxley said. “We had to know who was on the ice; we had to watch out for their key players and respect everyone.”
Later in the period at 9:17, Biega atoned for his penalty by halving the Bulldog lead. The defenseman took successive passes from teammates Luke Greiner and Conor Morrison, moving in from high on the right side of the zone and putting the puck past Rondeau with a low shot from the face-off circle’s edge.
“Danny’s obviously one of our best defensemen, but he’s got great offensive skills,” Valek said. “He’s a guy we rely on a lot to make big plays.”
After outshooting the Crimson 15-8 in the second period, the Yale offense kept up the high-powered pace in the third. Four minutes and 53 seconds into the frame, senior Brendan Mason took the puck from behind the goal line and came around the net from the left side, putting it past Carroll to extend the Bulldog lead to 3-1.
Soon after, Harvard senior forward Matt McCollem was called for a five-minute boarding penalty, and Yale cashed in on the advantage 40 seconds into the ensuing power play when junior Chad Ziegler took a pass from Little and fired a one-timer past Carroll.
“We were right there with them when we played five-on-five, but when we started taking penalties, that’s when we ran into trouble,” sophomore forward Marshall Everson said.
“I think they’re around thirty percent on the power play,” Valek added. “We took too many penalties. You can’t really win when you dig yourself that big of a hole, and we put ourselves in a tough position.”
Biega tallied his second goal with 37 seconds remaining, after a Bulldog penalty and Carroll’s pulling gave the Crimson a two-man advantage. The sophomore took a pass from junior forward Alex Killorn and fired a shot past Rondeau from the right circle to make the score 4-2, which is what it would be when the final buzzer sounded.
Despite the loss, Harvard enjoyed the opportunity to challenge an elite team on its home ice.
“It was awesome, it was really awesome,” Everson said. “It was nice to have a big crowd, to play the number one team, and have the chance to beat them...it’s nice to be in the spotlight a little bit.”
On the whole, Yale outshot Harvard, 39-31. Little led the Bulldogs with six shots, and Killorn paced the Crimson with five attempts.
The defeat marked the struggling Crimson’s 10th in 11 games, while Yale extended its winning streak to nine games, the longest active streak in the nation.
“We didn’t manage the puck too well,” Valek said. “We turned it over a couple of times and that cost us...[but] I think if we eliminate those mistake, we can play with pretty much anyone and I think we proved that. We stuck with them pretty much the whole game except for a few errors we made.”

Harvard is pretty sleepy during J-term—the undergraduate population shrinks by more than 80 percent, many of the students who remain on campus are holed up in their rooms writing theses, and even those who aren’t hard at work are banned from holding parties or hosting guests. But just down the river, MIT is an exciting place to be during the first month of the year.
For forty years, MIT has held Independent Activities Period during January. This monthlong phase features over 100 for-credit courses as well as over 600 not-for-credit activities—ranging from art workshops, to cooking classes, to hands-on engineering projects, to career guidance sessions, to lectures on dozens of topics.
While Harvard's break between semesters, squeezed like the rest of the FAS budget by economic pressure, is not nearly as enriched, Harvard students might still be able to enjoy some of the fun. MIT’s January activities are formally open only to "members of the MIT community," according to the IAP website, but an email from an MIT alum, forwarded over the Pforzheimer House open list, informed us that "discreet and helpful" members of "the world at large" (which includes Harvard!) would likely be welcomed at most events.
The solution to the Harvard J-term blues just might be masquerading as an MIT student for the month. Try to avoid the limited enrollment offerings, but if you’re on campus for J-term, check out the astoundingly large assortment of activities at our nerdy neighbor school. A night of contra dancing or underwater hockey (that’s right—puck, sticks, and scuba masks), a day spent reading the entirety of Beowulf aloud while walking, or an Integration Bee (like a spelling bee for math geeks) might be just the thing to spice up those cold weeks of long treks to Annenberg.
