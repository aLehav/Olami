After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Translation is as much about mediating different cultures as it is about language. But I like Ode 3.13 because it mostly lacks any culturally specific content—aside from the sacrifice of the young goat, that is. For the most part, a poem praising a beautiful, fresh spring can be appreciated by a 21st century reader as it was by Horace’s fellow Romans. And the compact image of the goat’s blood in the water is Horace at his best (picture the hot, red blood swirling in the ice-cold, perfectly clear waters of the fountain). All this makes the poem a good test case for the aesthetics of translation: how much of the form and content of the original Latin poem, its intricacies of imagery, wordplay, and rhythm, can be captured in English?
In this translation I’ve abandoned the original meter—Latin meter relies on syllable length, rather than stress, so it’s a bit beside the point to try to recreate it in English—but I’ve kept the poem’s tight organization of four four-line stanzas. The poem essentially hinges on the symbiotic relationship between the poet and the fountain he praises: without the poet, the fountain cannot attain fame, but without the fountain, the poet lacks a subject to sing about. You can follow this dynamic relationship in the last stanza with the pronouns alone, as the poem oscillates between the “I” of the speaker and the “you” of the fountain. Finally, in the last line of the poem, the speaker endows the waters of the fountain with their own capacity for speech and poetic voice. The poet has come to the fountain and lent his own voice, but only to allow the fountain to speak for itself. Not bad advice for a translator, either.
HORACE'S ODE 3.13
O fons Bandusiae, splendidior vitro
dulci digne mero non sine floribus,
cras donaberis haedo,
cui frons turgida cornibus
primis et Venerem et proelia destinat,
frustra: nam gelidos inficiet tibi
rubro sanguine rivos
lascivi suboles gregis.
te flagrantis atrox hora Caniculae
nescit tangere, tu frigus amabile
fessis vomere tauris
praebes et pecori vago.
fies nobilium tu quoque fontium,
me dicente cavis impositam ilicem
saxis, unde loquaces
lymphae desiliunt tuae.
TRANSLATION:
Fountain of Bandusia, more shining than glass,
worthy of wine not without flowers,
tomorrow you’ll be given
a young goat whose brow aching
with new horns is ready for love and for war
in vain. For he will dye your icy
streams with red blood,
this offspring of the playful flock.
You the harsh season of the burning Dog Star
cannot touch, you who offer beloved cold
to bulls tired from the plow
and to the wandering herd.
You will become one of the noble fountains
as I sing of the ilex tree hanging over
the hollow rocks from where
your waters leap with voices.

REFLECTION:
Poems are the way I seek something lasting in transience. My original idea for the thesis was to write a compilation of poems that revolved around my hometown of Newark, New Jersey, so that the poems could stand as representations of underrepresented beauty. As the process unfolded, the poems began to be about many things. I still think, though, that some of the most important of these poems find their setting in Newark. The poems of this thesis, ”In Transit,” are interested in dislocation and geography. Many of the poems are about literal moments of transportation: time spent on trains, buses, and airplanes. What all of these poems are concerned with is how to glean some permanence in the midst of change. The image I go back to often is that of a tree growing in the city; it is for me at once a symbol of resilient, uncommon, and often unnoticed strength, but also of something that is always in the process of encountering resistance to stability. Thus, the city tree recurs throughout these poems, which—if they hold anything else in common—is an obsession with memory and the movement of time.
 
The Red Line
 
 
 
 
At that verge when evening is not yet night
and the day is restless as to its end,
the train moves in the flow of the city.
Tired hands strain against the bars,
feeling the stress of weight bearing upon tracks.
An urban slumber suspended into a punctuated line.
Anonymous voices greet the passengers
as doors close and open and everything
pushes towards a pause while the sun melts
in echoes over rooftops and fire escapes and windows
overlooking the route, leaving the rest to a silence
of darkening shadow.  Each new image flashing
through the scratched windows into transit,
motioning forward an architectural silhouette,
leaving the small spaces of textured brick and
pavement carved into mathematical grids.
The train moves on towards Grand and Division,
marking what it may, leaving its tracks behind.
 
In Transit
 
 
 
 
My bags are heavy against the weight of the train
it grates against steel and I
long for continuous days which flow
into one another.  Instead
my life is a work of fragments.
Strings connected by inevitable distances.
I am lost in the fury of transit,
writing my poems in a
dark room on paper I cannot see.
Memory bites the new tongue
and I dream of home on a used pillow.
 
 
St. Lucy’s
 
 
 
 
To be granted grace in midwinter
by the softness of sunlight
breaking the smooth network
of tentative leaves in the small space
made intimate by benches and shrubs,
by its young trees whose hope rests
in tightly closed buds
as water breaks from the pipes
which crawl the brick building
is to almost forget the empty playground.
 
The playground
of concrete and gravel and parking spaces
becomes almost forgotten
in the sacrament of water’s flow,
a breaking of the ice
upon the pale orange wall,
seeping into pebbled earth,
streaming into crimson
eroded bricks which lie in pattern,
blessing the children’s laughter
which is no longer there,
teaching the will to stay
and the will to break.

Rebecca J. Levitan, Visual Arts
THC: What is the artistic thing that you do?
RJL: I’m a VES major, and so what I spend most of my artistic life doing is making artwork. This year I’ve been working on a series of paintings for my thesis that are produced through layers of silkscreens that I make from photocopies.
THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
RJL: My first painting class at Harvard—“Painting Day and Night.”  It was the first time I had worked in oil paint and it was a double realization for me: first that I loved painting as a medium, and second that I had to stop putting off being as committed as I wanted to be to art.  I kept being afraid of taking art because I thought it would take over everything else if I did it as much I as I wanted to.  I was right, but what I didn’t realize was that was actually a good thing.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
RJL: I’m sure I’ll look back on it and cringe. But I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing … The more I go back to my old work, the more I see ideas that I have since abandoned that might be worth taking up again or a way of working that was less polished but maybe more adventurous

Isabel Q. Carey, Theater
THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
IQC: Receiving my first speaking role freshman year and knowing that I’d earned it. That was heartening.
THC: Who are your greatest influences, at Harvard and in the larger artistic world?
IQC: At Harvard, I owe Calla Videt for showing me how interdisciplinary theater could be. I don’t follow theater as closely outside of Harvard as I should, but I deeply respect the ability of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival to survive year after year as a site for destination theater.
THC: In 30 years where do you see your skill with your medium having taken you?
IQC: Performer, diplomat, or just a crazy woman on the bus with the best vocal technique you’ve ever heard. Oh, oh, add “con artist” as well.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
IQC: Why did I agree to do so many dangerous things without getting paid? That mixed with jealousy of all the amazing roles they wasted on me as an upstart college kid.

Sam E. Chalsen, Writing
THC: What is the defining moment of your arts career at Harvard?
SEC: Last week we were shooting for “Ivory Tower” in a bathroom in Loker Commons. About 10 minutes after we started shooting, the Loker Bathroom Police kicked us out, resulting in a mad scramble to finish shooting while my other producer distracted them. This was a defining moment for me because it combined both my talent for producing film shoots in a radically shorter period of time than necessary and my love of writing scenes that take place in bathrooms.
THC: Who are your greatest influences, at Harvard and in the larger artistic world?
SEC: I learned how to write screenplays from reading Aaron Sorkin’s West Wing scripts over and over again, [which explains] why everything I wrote in high school involved characters talking really fast while walking around in hallways. At Harvard, Tony Hernandez ’10 gave me the best piece of advice I’ve ever been given for film or life: “It’s hard enough to get everyone together on set at the same time, so if it starts to rain, take out a pen and write ‘RAIN’ in the script.”
THC: In 30 years where do you see your skill with your medium having taken you?
SEC: I assume that I will be a multiple-Emmy-winning showrunner for a hugely popular premium cable drama and that I’ll have a 32,000 square foot bungalow in Santa Monica and a hot wife who works part-time at a locally-owned frozen yogurt shop. If that doesn’t happen, probably consulting.

THC: Who are your greatest influences, at Harvard and in the larger artistic world?
JCW: I am influenced by anybody who is passionately consumed by their art form in any genre of music, art, or other. I have a lot of respect for my peers who are directing groups on campus such as those working in theater, opera, and other orchestras. The University Choir director, Ed Jones, has also hugely influenced me in my rehearsal and conducting style.
THC: How do you think you’ll look back on your college work?
JCW: I loved getting to work with all the student extra-curricular organizations at Harvard, namely the Gilbert and Sullivan Players, the University Choir, the Harvard Krokodiloes, and the Bach Society Orchestra. They have given me many opportunities that I am extremely thankful for, and I have had many learning experiences with them that have shaped my own musical development.
THC: What is the funniest/strangest arts event you’ve been involved in?
JCW: Sophomore year I was given the opportunity to play a [specially] prepared piano in a new composition for the University Choir with orchestra. Specifically, I got to put metal chains directly on the piano strings and bang the hell out of the keys.

Karl Marx was talking about French politics when he quipped that when history repeats itself the first time is tragedy and the second farce, so it was appropriate that this past Saturday’s French presidential election confirmed the theory. The Socialist candidate, François Hollande, came out ahead, earning a berth in the runoff with incumbent Gaullist Nicolas Sarkozy, which he is widely expected to win as well. But more startling were the third and fourth place challengers. Marine Le Pen, the neo-fascist candidate whose father Jean-Marie won a spot in the 2002 presidential runoff, earned 18 percent of the vote, only ten points behind Hollande, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, a leftist backed by the French Communist Party who calls for a maximum income of $500,000, took in 11 percent.
Given the circumstances, one’s mind naturally turns to the last time Europe flirted seriously with far-left and far-right movements. And that, unsurprisingly to those of us who take an economically determinist view of political cycles, coincided with the last time that Europe had to deal with a financial meltdown and ensuing recession in the 1920s and 30s. Radical movements proliferated, with fascists gaining power in Germany and Italy and leftist and fascist governments ruling Spain in succession. Even the U.S. saw an uptick in interest in radicalism, with the quasi-fascist priest Charles Coughlin gaining widespread support.
Obviously, there is little risk of any of this repeating itself in the wake of the current crisis, not least because the continent’s current economic straits are markedly less dire than they were eighty years ago. But the parallels are real and illustrate a few ways in which politics hasn’t actually changed much in the intervening almost century.
For one thing, the weekend’s elections, and in particular Le Pen’s disturbingly strong showing, serve as a reminder that recessions typically result in a resurgence of xenophobic, racist, and otherwise reactionary social sentiments. The causal theory is simple enough. When times are bad, people search for scapegoats, and immigrants and ethnic minorities provide ready targets. But as Harvard economist Benjamin M. Friedman ’66 argued in his book “The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth,” the theory has a lot of empirical evidence backing it as well, with the pattern occurring across countries at all stages of development. Generally left-minded people have an unfortunate tendency of occasionally downplaying the importance of economic growth. But if one cares about social tolerance, few things are more critical.
This, of course, raises the question of what regime best promotes steady, broadly shared growth, and thus mitigates societal prejudice and secures various other social goods. The 1930s provided a trial by fire of different models of how to lead nations out of economic holes, and, as Sheri Berman argued in her outstanding study “The Primacy of Politics,” social democracy came out the victor. Classical liberals (what we would now call libertarians) and orthodox Marxists made plays at relevance, but they proved unable to deliver the goods. The liberals’ opposition to market interference left citizens to fend for themselves, as did the orthodox Marxists’ insistence that capitalism must be allowed to run its course until the revolution inevitably arrives. Two theories emerged that allowed for a more active state and thus a better cared-for populace: social democracy and fascism. And after the latter was defeated in battle (and by its own irrationality and barbarism) social democracy was left standing as the lone theory that allowed for both democratic governance and the redress of economic hardship.
So it’s fitting that Hollande, the representative of the French social democratic tradition in this year’s presidential race, would emerge the winner when the continent again found itself in crisis. His proposals—a 75 percent income tax bracket, CEO salary caps, and tougher bank regulation, among other things—sound radical to American ears, but are more responsive to the need to combat inequality and prevent future financial meltdowns than any policy initiatives on this side of the Atlantic. Indeed, in many cases they’re hardheaded and technocratic, given that the best evidence suggests that tax rates that high could be optimal.
Not a lot about politics is fair, but one thing that is, is that in well-functioning democracies like France (or really any country with a less rigid system than the United States’), policies that succeed in producing widely shared prosperity are rewarded at the ballot box. The failure to do so doomed classical liberals and Marxists in the 1930s, and it has doomed Sarkozy today. And social democracy’s consistently strong record in that regard is giving it yet another inning.

Last week, I attended a documentary screening on campus titled “Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North.” The documentary described how the DeWolf family’s wealth was founded on the slave trade.  Panelists following the screening discussed research that has recently uncovered many deep connections between Harvard and slave labor.  For example, Harvard Law school was established on land bequeathed from Harvard patron Isaac Royall Jr., whose family’s wealth was derived from slave plantations owned in Antigua and Surinam.  Slaves also followed the children of the wealthy onto the campus and served them in the dormitories, and worked in the houses of Harvard’s presidents and faculty. Even today, many of the portraits that hang in Harvard  Law School depict slave-owners.
Although slavery has been illegal for almost 150 years, the economic systems built on slave labor still exist today.   In fact, one of the panelists at the event on Harvard and Slavery asserted that there are more slaves in the world today that any other time in history. The difference now is that the overt practice of slavery has been driven underground. If we view slavery in a vacuum as an antiquated practice, we miss the strong connections it has to the exploitation of labor today. Slavery is an economic system in which a class of society benefits and profits from the labor of another, while the enslaved derives no benefits. Slavery is no longer legal in the United States, but vestiges of the system that created it persist in the form of racism, sexism, and the labor struggle of today. White male privilege guarantees that a certain percentage of the population, by virtue of its color and gender, has the mark of the servant. This privilege cuts down competition and concentrates power in fewer hands. Racism and sexism are societal constructs that keep oppressed people, of all races and genders, who are exploited for their labor from uniting with each other and becoming more powerful. This struggle isn’t over yet.
Despite its massive wealth, Harvard has continued to exploit its workers throughout its history. The University has systematically tried to ensure that its workers work as hard as possible for as little compensation as possible. In the 1930s, Harvard laid off 20 janitors and replaced them all with men after the minimum wage board had ruled that the women’s pay should be increased two cents per hour. Harvard did not even guarantee its workers a living wage until the Living Wage Campaign of 2001 forced the president to negotiate with protestors. In 2009, Harvard dealt with the financial crisis by instituting mass layoffs, especially among clerical workers, which left many libraries understaffed.
This semester, the University introduced a reorganization model of shared services to the libraries, by which they propose to streamline processes and reduce staff by an unspecified percentage. Library employees who are designated as "shared services" are nolonger paid out of their local school's budget.   The shared servicemodel creates service contracts, in which certain tasks that employeeshave been performing for years in circulation, technical services, andpreservation are listed, quantified and sold back to the libraries froma central administration called "Shared Services," the employees donot yet know which tasks will be assigned to them. Although a plan for library “restructuring” was announced in January, library workers still do not know how this will impact salaries and benefits for the employees who survive the staff reductions, or even how many employees the library will employ. Harvard, on the other hand, has plenty of money to handsomely compensate the employees who do the work it values most: making more money.
Unfortunately, viewing workers as commodities to be exploited can have other negative consequences for the university community. At a forum two weeks ago, workers and faculty members discussed concerns that, in addition to causing severe economic distress to loyal long term employees, the shared services model requires a standardization of procedures that will negatively impact the quality of services the libraries are able to provide. Harvard has a reputation as the greatest educational institution in the world because of the notable figures who have passed through its doors and left their mark on society. The Harvard Libraries, in their traditional form, served as an information resource that gave them access to a variety of materials that helped form a foundation for them as critical thinkers. At Harvard, the administration, the faculty, the students, and the workers are strongly dependent on each other, though these webs of interdependence are not always obvious. Continued exploitation of workers for financial gain is not only a step backward in the moral evolution of society, but it increases the likelihood that in the future Harvard’s reputation will be founded more on massive wealth than on excellence in education.

The World Cup is the king of soccer competitions.  Every four years, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association Executive Committee elects one lucky nation (or sometimes two) by secret ballot to host the competition.  Hundreds of millions of people watch the action of the contest, which consists of thirty-two teams playing through both group and knockout stages to be crowned world champions.
In 2010, FIFA convened to elect the host country for the 2022 competition (the huge amount of infrastructure requires many years for the host to prepare).  After the votes were cast, FIFA granted the honor to Qatar, which beat out the United States, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.  Qatar, a small Arab state located on the Persian Gulf with a population of only 1.5 million, should never have been awarded the 2022 World Cup bid.
The most obvious red flag with this decision is that there have been accusations of foul play in the Executive Committee’s decision. Specifically, concerns have been raised that a number of officials were bribed over one million dollars to vote for Qatar. If substantiated, these reports could result in an unprecedented re-vote for the bid, presumably with the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Australia vying for the honor.  The fate of the 2022 World Cup is now potentially completely up in the air.  This time, however, FIFA should handle the decision  with far greater care.
First of all, the World Cup is a summer competition.  Qatar is, frankly, a desert, with summer temperatures easily reaching 104 degrees Fahrenheit.  The average 90-minute soccer game is physically very taxing—it is not uncommon for players to run about seven miles over the duration of a game, including quite a bit of sprinting.  Not only would such heat be uncomfortable for the players, but it would also be downright dangerous.  The professional soccer world has seen its fair share of health incidents recently, notably the death of Italian Serie B midfielder Piermario Morosini, who collapsed and ultimately died during a league match in April.
To Qatar’s credit, it has released grand plans for new stadiums.  But while the proposed venues are certainly advanced and eye-catching, the four other countries that Qatar beat all have better resources to host an event on this scale.  The U.S. in particular, as it already has enough stadiums, would be well prepared to host the event. Qatar, contrarily, may find itself facing the problem of simply accomodating all of the soccer fans over the course of the tournament, which lasts an entire month.
The culture of the country could also prove to be very problematic.  Qatar is a conservative Muslim country, and the sale of alcohol is limited to five-star hotels.  The World Cup Finals, on the other hand, is normally a raucous and party-oriented event.  Alcohol consumption is an integral part and, despite the danger invariably associated with drunk fans at stadiums supporting different teams, it is unlikely that fans traveling thousands of miles to have fun and cheer on their home country will forsake the consumption of alcohol under any circumstances.  While alcohol is only one example, the culture in Qatar and the Arabian Gulf is certainly far more foreign to many soccer-lovers worldwide than other host countries, the most recent being South Africa and Germany, where the predominant Western culture was already well-known to many who came.
FIFA would thus do well to reconsider the 2022 World Cup location when the executive committee convenes to cast its new vote.  Qatar, despite making a strong presentation for itself with its state-of-the-art stadiums, nevertheless lacks important qualities necessary to host a global event on such a grand scale.

In a disappointing display of irony, organizers of Eleganza, an annual student-run fashion show, have ostensibly digitally altered models’ bodies. Pointing to physical evidence, students have accused Eleganza of making women appear thinner and men more muscular in the show’s promotional photos.
Eleganza executive producers have contended that the photos were altered in keeping with industry standards, but some raised concerns that evidence in the photos suggested that the shape of models’ bodies in the images had been modified. Indeed, it is disturbing that any organization on Harvard’s campus, particularly one that purports to promote diversity, may have edited the bodies of their fellow students. Eleganza would do well to remember that its mission—to honor diversity and “celebrate different cultures, backgrounds, and forms of expression”—is wholly incompatible with the morally dubious practice of digitally altering human bodies for advertisements.
The digital manipulation of male and female bodies is a damaging practice. It is no secret that unhealthy and unrealistic depictions of bodies in the media play a large role in exacerbating the development of eating disorders, not to mention the persistently poor body image suffered by a significant proportion of teens and young adults. The producers of Eleganza are Harvard students—not executives at fashion magazines or advertising agencies—and are no doubt well acquainted with the prevalence of body image issues among young people; they should not be in the business of perpetuating them.
In this same vein, it is disheartening that members of Eleganza have defended digital body manipulation by citing the show’s conformity with fashion industry standards. The fashion industry is rife with unhealthy and unrealistic depictions of human bodies. Bodies represented in the media are at times outside the realm of human possibility: Even the bodies of prominent celebrities who exert unfathomable amounts of energy exercising and dieting are routinely altered in professional photographs. Neither Eleganza nor any other student organization should consider the fashion industry’s prejudicial policies as an appropriate benchmark.
As a philanthropic event that aims to celebrate diversity and that donates all of its profits to the Center for Teen Empowerment—an organization that inspires teens to confront “difficult social problems”—Eleganza only does itself a disservice by conforming to the fashion industry’s most problematic practices. We urge Eleganza’s producers to avoid digitally altering models’ bodies not only for the benefit of the show’s participants and viewers, but also to bring the organization’s policies in line with its underlying philosophy.

In a new national poll of America’s youngest voting demographic conducted by Harvard’s Institute of Politics in late March and early April, 43 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said that they believe the President will win re-election.
“The way the primary played out, there is a belief right now that Obama has a better shot,” Institute of Politics Director C.M. “Trey” Grayson ’94 said. “Compared to the last poll, his approval ratings have improved. Overall there is just a more optimistic outlook for Obama.”
Republical presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, however, is struggling to reach this demographic. In this new poll, only 26 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds said that they planned to support him in the 2012 election.
“I was struck that Mitt Romney’s numbers didn’t move that much,” Grayson said. “However, he obviously has a better chance over the next few months to reposition himself. It was a nasty primary, and they really went head to head, but now he can focus more on the campaign for President. His number is not lower, he just lost a few months to sway voters.”
Obama’s current 17 percent lead among 18- to 29-year-olds accompanies a six percent increase in support from an IOP poll conducted in late November, in which 37 percent of those polled at the time said that they would most likely support Obama and 26 percent said that they would vote for Romney.
The new national poll also indicated that while the health of the economy remains a primary concern for 18- to 29-year-old voters, the percentage of young Americans who believe economic conditions are improving has increased from 12 percent to 20 percent since the last poll was conducted in late November.
Despite this increase in optimism and support for Obama, young voters still report feelings of distrust towards the government and political process. 59 percent of young voters agree that elected officials are motivated by selfishness, a four percent increase from the results of the previous poll. The percentage of those polled who self-report as politically active also decreased from 25 percent in November to 21 percent.
“Now you have a generation that grew up in the throes of a great recession and have seen the consequences of that,” said Director of Polling at the Institute of Politics John Della Volpe. “Surviving college and pay off loans trumps everything else.”

Nearly seven and a half million college students nationwide may see interest rates on their student loans double if Congress does not take action to maintain current rates, President Barack Obama said during a conference call with student journalists on Tuesday.
Obama said he believes keeping college affordable is a national economic concern.
“I’ve always believed that we should be doing everything we can to help put higher education within reach for every single American student,” he said. “In America, higher education can’t be a luxury.”
The interest rate for federally subsidized Stafford loans currently sits at 3.4 percent, thanks to a provision passed by Congress in 2007. However, if Congress does not extend the current low rate, it will spike to 6.8 percent on July 1.
Students who take out Stafford loans do not pay interest on their loan while in college and then pay below-market rates after graduation. Although Harvard financial aid packages do not include loans, a small number of students at the College do take out Stafford loans to complement any monies that they receive, Director of Financial Aid Sally C. Donahue said.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Joshua S. Goodman ’00 predicted that the 6.8 percent interest rate would increase the average student’s debt after graduation to $26,000. However, Goodman also said that the source of the funds for these subdsidized loans must be taken into account. Maintaining lower interest rates could take funds away from programs that assist lower-income students and, with the exception of institutions that have generous financial aid programs, there are relatively few other options available to help these students pay for college.
“Harvard is unusual in that it has this remarkable set of resources so that for very low income students a Harvard education is relatively inexpensive,” Goodman said.
Kennedy School Professor Christopher N. Avery ’88 said that despite increased interest rates, families will opt to bear additional financial burdens because it is worthwhile for most people to attend college.
“If you don’t go to college especially in these job markets prospects are really bleak, much bleaker without a college degree than with one,” he said.
However, Obama said in difficult economic times, small increases in debt can feel like a great burden for many American families.
“The central issue here is that if these were normal economic times, you would expect people to pay market rates on these loans,” Goodman said. “But these are not normal times,” he said.
Goodman suggested that a potential alternative would be to have income level determine the interest rate that students would have to pay.
“So if you had a job we should expect you to pay a higher interest rate on this loan, if you didn’t we would forgive you and give you the lower one,” he said.
Alternatively, he said, Congress could gradually raise interest rates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Karl Marx wrote that history is driven by the sequence of modes of production, but modes of food production may not have been what he had in mind.
Even so, renowned chef, food writer, and host of PBS’s “Primal Grill” Steven Raichlen argued that barbecue played a key role in human evolutionary and cultural history during a lecture Tuesday night in the Geological Lecture Hall of the Peabody Museum.
Raichlen, whose career as a food writer has focused almost exclusively on open-flame cooking, guided audience through global grilling culture, starting with its prehistoric invention, in his lecture, titled “Man Food Fire: The Evolution of Barbecue.”
Raichlen has gained particular acclaim for his blending of the study of cooking with broader scientific and literary narrative.
In Tuesday’s presentation, Raichlen began with a detailed comparison of prehistoric skulls.
Human’s early ancestors, such as Australopithecus and Homo robustus, had huge jaws designed for the laborious task of chewing raw meat and plant matter, Raichlen said.
It was not until sometime in the era of Homo erectus—some two million years ago—that fire was first harnessed, Raichlen explained. It was almost certainly an accidental discovery, probably from lightning or lava
“In any case, someone tasted and uttered the first grunt of gastronomic pleasure,” Raichlen added.
Raichlen proceeded to describe the numerous evolutionary benefits conferred by our prehistoric ancestors’ consumption of cooked foods.
The human jaws and teeth shrank, with easier matter to chew. Our brains grew, Raichlen argued, because they had more fuel—cooked food was easier to metabolize.
Human culture got a head start, according to Raichlen, as the division of labor developed: one group stood around tending the fire, while another ventured forth to hunt.
“Barbecue begat civilization,” Raichlen said.
The talk ended with a series of pictures of grilled foods from around the world, including spit-roast lamb from Azerbaijan, grilled eggs from Cambodia, and French mussels cooked directly on a bed of pine needles—“the best two-ingredient meal on the planet,” said Raichlen.
Directly after the talk, a barbecue and beer tasting was provided on the third floor of the Peabody Museum. The food was provided by Jason Bond of Cambridge’s Bondir Restaurant and included lamb belly in buccaneer sauce and charred spring onion. Cambridge Brewing Company provided the beer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Kennedy School student Bo Guagua, son of deposed Chinese Communist Party leader Bo Xilai, addressed the media for the first time in weeks in an exclusive statement to The Crimson. The statement, published in full by The Crimson online on Tuesday, shied away from his father’s political downfall and the recent murder accusation against his mother and instead offered Bo Guagua’s perspective on the rampant speculation in the international media regarding his private life and personal endeavors.
He addressed claims made in the press about his grades, his social life, and even the make of car that he drives.
“Recently, there has been increasing attention from the press on my private life,” he wrote. “As a result of these speculations, I feel responsible to the public to provide an account of the facts.”
Officials removed Bo’s father from his position as Party secretary of China’s Chongqing municipality in March and then ousted him from the Politburo—China’s most influential political body—the following month. Though Chinese officials did not disclose a reason for Bo Xilai’s removal, allegations of corruption and overextension of power have swirled against him for months.
In his statement on Tuesday, Bo addressed accusations that he lives a lavish lifestyle beyond the means of a government salary. He wrote that his private school education had been funded entirely by scholarships and assistance from his mother. He also denied media reports that he drove a Ferrari.
Much of his statement countered media reports of his supposedly poor academic performance and accusations that he was not qualified for admission to the Kennedy School.
“My examination records have been solid throughout my schooling years,” Bo defended himself, claiming a straight-A record on his AS and A-level exams in secondary school in the United Kingdom.
He also said that he ended his undergraduate career at Oxford University with the highest mark of distinction in philosophy awarded to degree recipients.
Bo, who also spoke to The Crimson in a phone conversation, wrote in an email that he remains enrolled at the Kennedy School and intends to complete the requirements to receive his degree. He declined to specify his current location or respond to queries about whether he intends to return to China after graduating.
Bo remained quiet on questions surrounding his parents and the political situation in China.
“I am deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation,” he wrote in his statement.
The statement made no mention of Neil Heywood, the British businessman whose murder last fall has been much discussed in connection with Bo since his mother was charged with the crime earlier this month.
Heywood, who had long lived in China before his death, has been said to have helped Bo gain admission to Harrow School—a prestigious English secondary school—and later to Oxford.
According to a Daily Mail report, Chinese authorities said that the family’s relationship with Heywood soured following “a conflict over economic interests.”
While he was a student in England, Bo’s behavior came under scrutiny as reporters examined rumors of his father’s corruption. Many questioned how the family could afford to underwrite their son’s private education and allegedly glamorous social life.
In his statement on Tuesday, Bo expressed graditude to the Harvard community for its support as he has avoided the intense gaze of the media in recent weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a year and a half after the University announced its intent to make the Administrative Board’s decision-making process more transparent, a database providing summaries of past cases for the College’s top disciplinary body is yet to be seen.
The first part of the database, containing information on cases of academic integrity, is slated for release at the end of this school year, Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said.
The data is targeted to help students—particularly those facing the Ad Board—gain a better understanding of the Board’s process, often characterized by students as secretive. The database would provide students with information on the process and outcome of past cases—going back three years for issues of academic integrity and 10 years for peer disputes, including sexual assault.
Ellison announced the project in September 2010, anticipating at the time that the information would be available before the end of the semester. In February 2011, Megan R. Mitrovich, who as then a management fellow in Ellison’s office in charge of working on the database, predicted that the statistics would be released by the end of the academic year.
But fear of inadvertently revealing individuals’ identities connected with specific cases has slowed down the process of creating a database, Ellison said.
The difficulty lies, he added, in finding “the right mix between privacy and disclosure,” so that student have enough information about what goes on in the Ad board behind closed-doors without comprising students’ confidentiality.
Ellison said that the database of academic infractions, tentatively set for release before this summer, will most likely include the division under which the incident took place, the type of academic infraction in question, and the ultimate conclusion of the Board. It remains unclear whether the course will also be specified.
Once this database of academic cases is released, Ellison said the Board plans to finish a similar set of information regarding peer disputes, including sexual assault cases, for the past 10 years. In the process of compiling the database, Ellison and Mitrovich decided to expand the range from the original five-year time frame to ensure the privacy of students involved.
Laura Schlosberg, resident dean of Mather House, is currently distilling the information to protect students’ identities.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sorting through the details of a foreclosure case, Joseph P. Kennedy III sat in a small room of the Rental Housing Resource Center near City Hall in Downtown Boston. Kennedy, fellow Harvard Law School student Nicholas J. Hartigan, and a third-party mediator were working through a standard pre-trial mediation on behalf of a client being sued for eviction.
“You know, you really look an awful lot like that guy,” the mediator mused as the conversation came to a lull, Hartigan recalls. He put his head down and tried to suppress a laugh. Kennedy looked at the table, letting the statement fall unanswered.
The comment was entirely innocent, Hartigan says, but Kennedy did resemble the man in the photograph. It was his grandfather, Robert F. Kennedy ’48, the former U.S. Attorney General.
Kennedy and Hartigan were members of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, one of the Law School’s student-run nonprofit legal services organizations. Not yet accredited attorneys but much more than casual volunteers, they dedicated much of their law school years to representing low-income, often immigrant, clients in the Boston area.
For Kennedy, the heir to a political dynasty stretching back generations, his work at the Bureau was more than just a box to check in the field of public service or a duty to his family’s reputation, friends say.
“There’s no obligation for a kid at Harvard Law School to spend a bunch of time in Dorchester,” Hartigan says. “It’s just stuff he made a conscious effort to do, really for the sole purpose that it’s what he wanted to do.”
Less than three years after graduating from the Law School, the 31-year-old Kennedy announced he would enter the race for the seat being vacated by longtime Congressman Barney Frank ’61-’62 in Massachusetts Fourth Congressional District.
In January, he left the Middlesex Country prosecutor’s office and quickly assumed his place at the front of the field. Early polling has shown Kennedy with as much as a two-to-one lead over his chief Republican rival Sean Bielat.
As polls and fundraising scorecards have shown, Kennedy will have every advantage his family’s name and connections can bring him.
But according to those who knew him at the Law School, Kennedy’s career there—which may fit nicely into his family’s tradition of public service—was uniquely his own.
A BUSY MAN
Kennedy was one of about 25 students accepted to join the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau at the end of his first year, and it soon became his defining experience at the Law School.
The Bureau—affectionately called “HLAB”—is the oldest and most reputable student-run clinic at the Law School which aims to give legal representation to marginalized groups that could otherwise not afford it.
Students like Kennedy enter the Bureau with little to no legal experience and are almost immediately put to work representing clients of their own. Basically, Hartigan explains, the first weeks at the Bureau are a crash course. Ultimately students testify in court, raise cases, meet with clients, and even represent their clients in trial.
“It was one of the first opportunities I actually had to practice the law,” Kennedy says. “To see how the law actually affects people on an individual level, many of whom were the people who the law was designed to protect.”
At the Bureau, Kennedy quickly assumed a leadership position, being elected to the clinic’s board as the outreach director. When Hartigan and fellow Bureau member David E. Haller ’03 decided to start a special foreclosure task force in 2008, they looked to Kennedy to help facilitate the launch of the unprecedented initiative which would add even more work to the already over-burdened Bureau staff.
“The first person that I went to when we were trying to do this was Joe. I knew that Joe was the type of person who would work his butt off,” Hartigan says. “It was the kind of thing where if we had him on our side we had a lot better shot.”
With Kennedy’s help, Hartigan and Haller aimed to visit every foreclosed property in Boston, bringing on more clients than the Bureau had dealt with before.
The initiative, No One Leaves, found most of its cases in Dorchester and South Boston where owners of triple-decker homes often rent out upstairs apartments. As the financial and housing crises swept across the country, more and more of these homeowners slipped into foreclosure, and renters were left in the cold—at which point Hartigan, Kennedy, and other staffers would arrive.
Even without the extra work of task forces like No One Leaves, HLAB is intense. If accepted, students must commit to two years of service. Officially, members will work about 20 hours a week, says Boston lawyer Elizabeth Nessen, Kennedy’s former advisor at the Bureau. But according to former bureau members, 20 hours is the bare minimum, and most students would often push 30- or 40-hour weeks.
“I spent every day with Joe...from the minute the sun rose to after it set. The bureau is a really insane time commitment,” says one of Kennedy’s Law School classmates, who requested to remain anonymous as her job prohibits her from speaking with the media.
As one of the few fluent Spanish speakers at HLAB, Kennedy was always on call. Hartigan and others would often summon him from class to translate, and Kennedy, dropping everything, would get in his pick-up truck and drive wherever he was needed.
The overflow of work at the Bureau made keeping up with classes and other activities a battle.
“I think the word balance is just a level of control that we probably didn’t have,” Hartigan explains with a laugh. “It’s a lot of triage.”
But HLAB was not the only claim on Kennedy’s time. He also served as the technical editor for The Harvard Human Rights Journal, responsible for checking references and citations for each article before it was printed. In the spring of 2007, Kennedy co-cooridanated the journal’s 20th anniversary conference.
Off-campus, Kennedy helped found an after-school education and outreach program in Jamaica Plain with his future fiancée and fellow HLS student Lauren A. Birchfield. And during the lead up to the 2008 presidential election, he traveled the country as a translator for his uncle Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, who was campaigning on behalf of then-Senator Barack Obama.
In the classroom, Kennedy was a solid student, former classmates said, though worn a little thin by his extra-curricular activities. During his three years at the Law School, he twice took courses taught by Law School professor and current U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren, and worked closely with Professor Lucie E. White on human rights and poverty issues.
A FAMILY LEGACY
Kennedy’s enrollment in Harvard Law School in 2006 was in more than one way a return home. When his parents, Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II and Sheila Brewster Rauch, divorced in 1991, Kennedy came to live exclusively in Cambridge; until that point he had split his time between Cambridge and Kennedy property in Hyannis, Mass.
With his twin brother Matthew R. Kennedy, Kennedy attended Buckingham, Browne, and Nichols, a private preparatory school in Cambridge, and then Stanford. After graduating, Kennedy spent two years in the Dominican Republic as a Peace Corps volunteer—a watershed experience he has often pointed to as a candidate.
Kennedy returned home from abroad in 2006, honored, he says, to have been admitted to Harvard Law School, a campus steeped in ancestral legacy.
Yet, for all his striking resemblances to iconic family members—the shock of red hair, slightly untamed, the sharp facial features, freckled with an Irish complexion, the wide convincing gait—Kennedy’s time at Harvard was shaped by his own interests more so than a familial legacy.
A number of Kennedy’s closest friends from law school said it took them months to realize just who the laid-back Kennedy really was.
“As far as I knew, he was just a guy who played college lacrosse, and we were having a lot of fun working together,” Hartigan says.
“He’s about as normal as it gets,” says Kennedy’s classmate who requested anonymity. “He’s a very dressed-down type when he’s in his element.”
Kennedy was just as unassuming with his clients, Bureau colleagues say, never going out of his way to mention his last name or allude to his family.
“That was just his way,” Nessen says.
“What’s funny about it is, Joe could very well be trumpeting who he is and where he comes from—and he’s got every right—but he just never, never talks about it,” Kennedy’s classmate says. “It’s not because he’s secretive, but it’s because he’s built his whole life on standing on his own two feet.”
“UNCHARACTERISTIC OF HIM”
For a Kennedy, politics is the perpetual elephant in the room, but the young Congressional candidate says he had no intention of running for public office when he arrived at Harvard Law School.
Those who worked with him at the Legal Aid Bureau or the Human Rights Journal agree that Kennedy did not have overt political ambitions, even if the work he was doing provided a recognizable political foundation.
“He has this commitment to public service, but he wasn’t the person in my group that I thought was going to run for office,” Nessen says. “It’s actually uncharacteristic of him.”
But by the time he graduated from the Law School, Kennedy’s stance had changed. Though he had always been committed to public service, public office seemed an increasingly likely option for the young graduate.
“I wasn’t thinking about running for public office when I got here,” Kennedy says. “I think the experience of learning what the law can do to set the structures for society and then what you can do to change that...definitely led to my decision to eventually run.”
Even if they would not have expected it, friends say they are not surprised Kennedy is running. His focus on public service and social justice at the Law School, they say, laid the groundwork for either of two careers: law or poltics.
“It certainly wasn’t something we talked about, but it’s not at all different from the type of community work we did when I knew him,” Hartigan says. “Everything I’ve done with him has been dealing with people and doing things to be active in the community, and I think in the better sense of what they do, that is what politicians do.”
“From a pure, personality perspective, this is somebody who in pretty much every respect is built for [pubic office] in ways more than he even knows,” his classmate says.

Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, a Harvard Divinity School professor, has been appointed Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, the University announced Wednesday. Walton is an ordained Baptist minister who received tenure as a professor at the Divinity School this semester.
“I’m excited, honored, extremely humbled. This is arguably one of the most prestigious ecclesiastical and academic positions on the planet,” Walton said. “It is a perfect blend of scholarly excellence and congregational vitality.”
University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement that Walton, who has accepted the position once held by the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes, would “bring new life to spirituality and religion at Harvard.”
“He is among the country’s foremost scholars of African American religion, a powerful preacher, a thoughtful pastoral presence, and a wonderful human being,” she said. “His scholarly and ecclesiastical callings are mutually enriching in the best traditions of campus ministry.”
Walton’s strength as both a practicing minister and a scholar of religion was an important factor in his appointment, according to Faust. In addition to his preaching role at the Church, Walton will continue his academic and teaching endeavors at Harvard Divinity School in his capacity as the Plummer professor of Christian morals.
“I think he has had a sense of having two separate commitments in his life—a deep commitment to scholarship and teaching and the other [to] his life as a preacher,” Faust said. “This opportunity just brings it together for him in a way that I think he finds really appealing.”
Walton, a prominent scholar of African-American religion, graduated from Morehouse College and later received a Ph.D. from Princeton Theological Seminary. His first book, “Watch This!: The Ethics and Aesthetics of Black Televangelism,” focuses on the relationship between media and religion.
Walton arrived at Harvard in 2010 as an associate professor at the Divinity School and a resident scholar in Lowell House.
Lowell Housemasters Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin added that Walton, who can often be found mingling with students in the Lowell Dining Hall, is committed to engaging with Harvard undergraduates in addition to carrying out his formal duties.
“This is a wonderful appointment. He’s such a brilliant preacher and scholar. He’s so deeply engaged with students, and he’s been a wonderful leader in this community. We will miss having him and his wife and children [in Lowell],” Austin said.
“People felt he was a wonderful member of the House,” added Eck, who was a member of the committee tasked with finding a new minister. “I don’t think some students had any idea that he was a practicing minister—so for them his appointment was a pleasant surprise.”
Walton said he hopes to maintain Memorial Church as a welcoming environment for the Harvard community.
“I understand that everyone may not belong to Memorial Church,” he said. “We are a very diverse community, but I want to everyone to know that Memorial Church belongs to everyone.”
The appointment follows a yearlong search after the death of Gomes, who was known at Harvard as the University’s spiritual leader and across the country as a skilled orator and best-selling author.
“There will never be another Peter Gomes, so there’s no need for me to even try,” Walton said. “I just pray that this community will embrace me and I’m confident that they will embrace me for who I am, my country twang and all.”

The Harvard Library took another step toward making research materials and library resources more accessible when it announced yesterday that it will make more than 12 million bibliographic records for a wide range of materials—including books, images, videos, and manuscripts—available to the public.
The announcement represents an official University effort to increase the availability of library resources at a time when open access to academic materials has become a hot topic in the publishing community at large.
It also comes on the heels of the circulation of a memo written by the Faculty Advisory Council on the Library last week stating that Harvard cannot maintain its extant level of journal subscription if publishers continue to raise prices at current rates.
“It’s just not possible for the budget of the library to continue paying the kinds of increases which have been experienced in the past without damaging collections in other areas,” said James Engell, an English professor and member of the Faculty Advisory Council. "We therefore must explore emerging paths and models to ensure that all faculty and researchers have available to them the materials that they need."
The Harvard Library currently spends almost $3.75 million on journals a year, according to the memo—a value that comprised more than 20 percent of the periodicals budget in 2010 and almost 10 percent of the Library’s total collections budget.
According to Engell, the prices of online journals have increased dramatically over the last six to seven years, but the Faculty Advisory Council wanted to wait to issue a public letter until it had thoroughly discussed the issue internally.
“We’re concerned that our colleagues across the university perhaps aren’t aware of the gravity of the situation,” Engell said. “We want to inform them about that.”
Many faculty members contribute articles to or are involved in peer review for these journals, and the Faculty Advisory Council memo encourages them to make their work publicly available through the Digitial Access to Scholarship at Harvard repository, to contribute to open access journals, and to advocate for more reasonable and sustainable access.
Although faculty are not required to contribute, over half the faculty have already done so, according to University Librarian Robert C. Darnton ’60.
He added that even students have joined the effort, with student open access fellows “knocking on doors” and helping faculty deposit articles.
“If I had to select one word to describe what I’m trying to do with the library it would be openness,” Darnton said. “It’s also a national asset, a national treasure.... Well now we can share this national asset, as I see it, through the electronic revolution.”
Some librarians think the discussion should have recieved public attention earlier.
“It is a topic that has been in discussion for ten years or more and that is well documented in the scientific literature,” said Sebastian Hierl, Librarian for Western Europe. “My point of view is that we should have had this discussion several years ago.”
The trend of high prices used to mainly affect scientific journals, which tend to be more lucrative for publishers. Four large publishing companies—Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, and Nature—are now the primary science publishers, but price hikes have spread to social science and humanities publications as well.
For example, Hierl cited the Italian publisher Fabrizio Serra, which has increased costs 100 percent each year for the last ten years. Some publishers will charge up to ten times more than their smaller competitors for comparable journals, and by combining key journals into bundles with less well-known journals, publishing companies also force institutions like Harvard to buy more than they need.
Faculty members usually contribute their work free of charge to publishers. But while professors receive no monetary compensation, they must publish in reputable journals to receive tenure appointments.
While publishers will say they promote scholarship through “peer review and editorial support,” in addition to widespread distribution, Hierl said he still thinks they should not be gaining undue profit from academic work.
“Why pay a publisher to sell you what you yourself have produced?” he said.
Hierl said he is concerned the model of rising prices could expand to book publishing and other publication forms, as well.
Harvard has also been actively involved in implementing the new Digital Public Library of America, of which former law professor John G. Palfrey '94 is chair.
The DPLA, a national effort to digitize every book in the world, will open in April 2013. Leaders of the project are still working on ways to digitize as many book as possible without infringing copyright.
“Harvard’s part of that; we’ve taken the lead,” Darnton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The winds of change howling through the world of sports safety have become impossible to ignore. Traditional football has nearly been toppled by the gusts, and the winds’ next victim, hockey, lies just around the corner. Adding to the drafts is none other than our little Ivy League.
The breezes began back in 2009, when the NFL was called out by Congress for not adequately protecting its players from the dangers of concussions and other head injuries.
Before the hearing, the most popular American sport considered it manly and honorable to go back into battle after suffering a concussion, and players were only held out of the game if they lost consciousness. That kind of irresponsibility would no longer be tolerated—or so we thought.
When NFL players entered the stadiums to kick off the 2010-11 season, they left progress at the door. In week one, Eagles head coach Andy Reid sent Stewart Bradley back into a game against the Green Bay Packers after the linebacker took a hit to the head, attempted to get back up, and then stumbled and fell right back to the turf.
Things only got worse from there. Finally, things hit a tipping point in week six, as an embarrassing number of vicious hits, including two by Pittsburgh bad boy James Harrison, led to the uproar necessary for the league to institute real change. Heavy fines were instituted, and common sense employed.  The gusts could not be ignored. Change was in the air.
In college ball, it was none other than the Ivy League that stepped up first and began to seriously address the issue. Before the 2011 season, the Ancient Eight became the NCAA’s progressive conference by instituting a number of rule changes to limit hits in practice.
But there is still plenty of work to be done.
The recent suicide of Ray Easterling – one of several former NFL players suing the league– as well as an increasing wealth of scientific evidence on the effects of football hits on kids in high school and Pee Wee Leagues are signs that we need to further investigate how to make the sport safer and help those who have been damaged for our entertainment.
Though the Ivy League doesn’t carry much weight as a minor FCS Division I conference that doesn’t compete in postseason play, its alumni wield great power in other fields. The Big East or Pac-12 might not follow the lead of a Harvard or Penn on the football field, but Harvard graduates have the capability to lead in their areas of expertise.
Former Crimson football players Chris Nowinski ’00 and Vin Ferrara ’95 provide strong examples of what can be done. Nowinski has established himself as a leading activist, while Ferrara has set out to design a better football helmet. Harvard graduates in government, science, and education should follow Nowinski and Ferrara’s lead.
In contrast to the impact of its new policies in football, the reaction to the upcoming Ivy League rule changes in hockey, lacrosse, and soccer may be more immediate and more widely felt. Harvard and other Ancient Eight schools are Division 1 competitors in most of these sports and members of the sports’ top tiers in some cases.
But while the dangers of concussions in football have been covered on front pages since 2009, concussions in hockey, lacrosse, and soccer have not seen the same amount of coverage. That means that when the league’s concussion committee presents its findings and recommendations, it could spark a much-needed discussion about safety in the three sports.
The sport most in need of a shift in philosophy is hockey, and it’s not even close—a fact the NHL playoffs have made disgustingly clear. Nearly every series has seen its share of illegal and dangerous hits to the head, including concussive blows to a number of key players.
Earlier this year, a Philadelphia Flyer hid his concussion for fear of looking like a wimp and a freeloader while vying for a job. More unfortunate than that though, is the admiration he received for being a “tough guy.” I’m confident that in five years, actions and reactions such as these will be looked upon as savage, but we can’t let time fight our battles.
Amid the embarrassments, good signs can be found. When a Toronto Maple Leaf similarly hid concussion symptoms, he was lambasted by the team’s GM, Brian Burke, and Penguins superstar Sidney Crosby was seemingly given all the time he needed to return from concussion symptoms. These may be signs of an oncoming windstorm of change.
Blown stronger by the upcoming actions of the Ivy League, the winds may soon whistle past NFL stadiums and up against the machismo of the NHL, not relenting until much-needed progress arrives. But there is still a long way to go, and the Ivy League’s upcoming statements will only be the beginning of a long and arduous process of change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an ugly loss to Holy Cross in the 2011 season opener, things looked bleak for the Harvard football team. But nine games and nine wins later, Harvard sat unscathed atop the world of Ivy football. And like Beethoven with his symphonies, the Crimson saved its best win for its last, its ninth: in Harvard’s Ode to Joy, the squad trounced the Bulldogs 45-7 to finish the Ivy League season a perfect 7-0.
In the process, seemingly every week, some new program record was matched or broken. In the end, the Crimson had scored 374 points in 10 games, a modern-era Harvard record.
For Crimson coach Tim Murphy, despite beating every Ivy opponent by at least 10 points, the characterization of the 2011 season as a Crimson cakewalk is off base.
“Guys like you, guys who write for The Crimson and The Boston Globe, say we breezed through our schedule,” said Murphy after Saturday’s Spring Game. “Well, I guarantee you the Brown game didn’t feel like a breeze. The Princeton game didn’t feel like a breeze. The Cornell game didn’t feel like a breeze.”
Murphy, in a sense, is right. Those games were close until they weren’t (the Crimson topped Brown, Princeton, and Cornell by 17, 17, and 10, respectively). But more importantly, Harvard finished three games ahead in the conference standings in a seven-game season. If that’s not domination, I don’t know what is.
But with this past Saturday’s Spring Game, and with the 2012 squad beginning to take shape, you have to ask the question: Can they take the Ivies again? Will there be an encore performance in the fall?
In my mind, the answer is yes.
The offense might still be too strong for any Ivy opponent to handle. With the biggest question—the wide receiver corps—seemingly answered with the emergence of players like sophomores Ricky Zorn and Matt Brown, the Crimson attack is poised to be deadly once more in 2012.
Junior quarterback Colton Chapple, who as a backup had arguably the best two-game stretch of any quarterback in Harvard history, is back under center. The running back tandem of junior Treavor Scales and freshman Zach Boden, who combined for 1300 yards last season, will return with an additional year of experience. But most deadly may be the Crimson’s two tight ends, junior Kyle Juszczyk and sophomore Cam Brate, players that no one seemed to have an answer for all season long.
On the other side of the ball, the D-Line looks to be a force once more, led by junior Nnamdi Obukwelu, who Murphy believes could be “one of the top two or three players in the entire league.” The Crimson has talent in the secondary as well.
But the path to a repeat won’t be easy.
For one, the rest of the Ivy League has only gotten stronger since 2011. First in line to the Ivy throne appears to be Penn, the 2010 and 2009 champion. A young Quakers team couldn’t handle the Crimson last season in a 37-20 loss, but Penn returns the dangerous quarterback-running back combination of seniors Billy Ragone and Brandon Colavita. Perhaps more concerning to the Crimson will be Cornell and its quarterback, reigning Ivy League Offensive Player of the Year Jeff Mathews.
And of course, there’s Yale, which punched below the belt and lured away a healthy chunk of Harvard coaches, taking with them secrets of the Crimson program.
On top of that, many of the Crimson’s stars are hitting the road. The team loses defensive tackle Josue Ortiz ’11, the reigning Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year, the Czar of the Line of the Scrimmage. Under Ortiz’s brutal regime, the Crimson allowed a league-low 89.7 rushing yards per game.
And it’s not just Ortiz that’s moving out. That 2012 roster will be missing shutdown corner Matt Hanson, stalwart left tackle Kevin Murphy, captain Alex Gedeon, and quarterback Collier Winters, a man who directed three straight victories over Yale.
But in the end, despite these issues, Harvard has all the tools to pull off a repeat. It’ll be a bumpier, more winding, and more unpredictable road to the top than last year, that’s for sure, but the Crimson has the horsepower to do it.
“I know we’ll be the favorites, which no one is really ever excited about,” Murphy said. “All of those [Ivy League] teams are going to be much better teams, starting with Yale. So it’ll be a challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The chance to compete in the World Rowing Under 23 Championships in Trakai, Lithuania, may be awaiting two members of Harvard’s heavyweight crew. Freshman Max Meyer-Bosse, part of the Crimson’s freshman eight, has been invited to the Men’s U23 National Team Sculling Camp in Norwalk, Conn., while junior Parker Washburn, five-seat in the varsity eight, has been selected to participate in  the Men’s U23 National Team Sweep Camp in Seattle, Wash. Both camps will be used in selecting the national teams.
Members from fellow Ivy squad Brown earned the greatest number of invitations to the sculling camp, with three. Two Princeton members also received a spot at the camp. The rest of the participating schools are sending one participant each, for a total of 18 spots in the camp. Coach Yan Vengerovskiy will select the quadruple sculls to compete at the World Championships.
Twenty-three athletes have been invited to the sweep camp. The University of Wisconsin and University of Washington are sending the most members wtih four each. From the Ivy League, the Tigers follow close behind with three participants. Luke McGee and Paul Cooke are the coaches who will be responsible for selecting the men’s eight and men’s four to compete in Lithuania.
The final rosters will be announced by July 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The alarm clock rings at 2:00 a.m. on Friday morning.
Twenty-three-year old Ted Minnis rolls out of bed, gets dressed, and kisses his three-year-old son Josh goodbye before stepping out into the crisp morning air in Menlo Park, Calif.
It’s now 2:10 in the morning. Minnis is off to work at Durham Meat Company, where he lifts hundreds of pounds of meat into a truck and makes deliveries to locations all over the Bay Area.
At 11:00 a.m., Minnis drives down in the meat truck to Lynbrook High School in San Jose. He arrives in the parking lot just as his team is starting to warm up and blows his air horn to let them know the coach has arrived. He runs to the pool, gathers his team, and gives them a few quick last-minute words of encouragement.
It’s now 12:10 p.m. Minnis has a quick post-game meeting with his players and then rushes out again to finish his deliveries.
At 2:00 p.m., Minnis returns to coach his second game of the day. Afterwards, he finishes up his final deliveries and then returns home to play with his son before going to sleep.
Nearly two decades later, Minnis finds himself in a very different place in his second year as the Harvard water polo coach. But it’s a place he always imagined he would end up.
“I think I realized early on that I wasn’t going to be a pro athlete,” Minnis says. “But I loved sports, and I wanted to be involved in something to do with sports with my life. Everyone said that I was good at coaching.”
Now standing at 6’5”, the Menlo Park native was always taller than most of his peers growing up. His athletic career began on the basketball court, where he was known for his low-post game. But in eighth grade, one of Minnis’ friends introduced him to a different sport: water polo.
“It’s funny because, I’m almost 6’5”, but for a basketball player, I’m not tall,” Minnis says. “I couldn’t handle, I couldn’t dribble; my basketball career was short-lived. I was trying to decide if I was going to play football, because I’m a big man, or water polo; all my friends were going to play water polo, and I had a swimming background.”
His decision to return to the pool turned out to be a defining point in his life.
Minnis jumped right into the sport, joining the Menlo-Atherton high school team, where he played in goal.
But Minnis did not graduate from Menlo-Atherton, leaving the school after the birth of his son, Josh. In order to provide for his family, Minnis found a job making deliveries for a local meat company.
“I had a son, so I had to make money,” Minnis says.
But Minnis did not stay away from the pool for long, though, returning to coach the men’s water polo team at his alma mater at age 21. It was a position he held for the next 11 years of his life.
“I worked, coached, and then came home to sleep,” Minnis said. “Then I got up, played with my son. We did that for a while.”
Juggling a job at the meat company, duties as a father, and a coaching position was no easy feat.
Working at the meat company was grueling, physically demanding work.
Minnis regularly woke up at 2 a.m. to get in early shifts so that he could get off work early enough to start coaching in the afternoon and see his son.
Five years after his son Josh was born, Minnis filed for divorce from his wife, and when Josh turned 10, he gained full custody of his son.
“I was off and on with my mom and dad until I was 10 years old,” Josh Minnis said. “After 10, I started staying with my dad during the week and visiting my mom on weekends. He didn’t raise me by himself, my mom also helped, [but] my dad has always been there for me. He made sacrifices like not going to college because he had to make sure there was food on the table.”
While Minnis found himself a single father at an early age, he stresses that he had help along the way.
“I was very lucky because all my family is in the Bay Area; I was lucky to have that support,” Minnis says. “[My ex-wife] would see him every other weekend. It wasn’t like she was a deadbeat mom. Yeah things were cramped, we probably got on each others nerves, but [Josh is] a very good kid, and he always made it easy on me.”
Although his situation was difficult at times, Minnis seems to have kept a positive outlook on his life.
“For me, I just did what came naturally as a dad,” Minnis said. “People were always amazed that I had full custody of him and he lived with me. My friends always tell me ‘your life should be a movie.’ And I always respond, ‘I don’t know, I’m just doing me.’”
One day, opportunity came knocking at Minnis’ door. The Castilleja School, an independent girls school in Palo Alto, offered him a full-time coaching gig.
“I decided that I couldn’t throw a hundred pounds of meat on my shoulder for the rest of my life,” Minnis said. “I wanted to get paid for what I could do and not what I could lift, [so] I actually went back to school and [received] an opportunity [to work] at the Castilleja School.”
Minnis arrived at the Castilleja School in the late ’90s.  There, Minnis coached everything from middle school softball to high school basketball for 11 years. He served as the middle school director athletic director and before he left Castilleja, he served as the interim high school athletic director while athletic director Jez McIntosh was on a sabbatical at Stanford helping out with the Stanford women’s basketball team.
“Ted rebuilt the water polo program at Castilleja,” McIntosh said. “We had a strong program in the 80s, but it kind of deteriorated. [Ted] was brought in in ‘98 and reestablished a competitive program here. He was a true ambassador for the sport; he probably approached every girl on campus to try water polo.”
While working at Castilleja, Minnis also coached for the Stanford University women’s water polo club team with current Stanford women’s water polo head coach John Tanner while attending classes at San Jose State University.
Taking classes at San Jose State was a sign of recommitment to education for Minnis, who had struggled with dyslexia at a young age.
“School was difficult for me,” Minnis says.  “Once I realized [getting my college degree] was what I wanted to do, and what I wanted to be, things started to open up for me.”
Indeed, more doors would open for the Bay Area native.
In 2005, Minnis received his college degree from San Jose State University and got asked to teach full-time at the Castilleja School.
"[It] was amazing for me because I was getting paid to coach water polo and teach,” Minnis said. “Even before I got my degree, doors opened up. Doors opened up because of water polo, they saw what I could do with the kids.”
In July 2010, Ted Minnis was hired as the men’s and women’s water polo coach at Harvard.
What began as an assistant coaching job with the boy’s basketball team at the Phillips Brooks School in Menlo Park finally came to a dream fulfilled and realized.
“I always wanted to coach in college, but I couldn’t coach because I didn’t have a college degree,” Minnis said. “I thought I would spend the rest of my career at Castilleja. [Harvard] is the only place that would get me away from there.”
Word of Minnis’ employment reached Harvard senior attacker Lizzie Abbott particularly quickly. Abbott had played for Minnis at the Stanford club team from a young age and had been in contact with Minnis during his hiring process.
“He was my first coach for my club team. We took third at Junior Olympics when I was sixteen,” Abbott says. “When he got the job in June, it was really exciting. He just knows so much about me as a player and as a person. Not a lot of people can say that [about their college coach].”
For Minnis, working at Harvard as the men’s and women’s water polo coach is a culmination of years and years of hard work and focused dedication to his dream of coaching at the collegiate level.
During his time coaching and working as the middle school athletic director at the Castilleja School, Minnis gained an appreciation of the idea of the scholar-athlete, an idea that he has brought with him to Harvard.
“Castilleja is a school that is a very academic school,” Minnis said. “For me, I knew what it meant to coach an Ivy League athlete. [Although] I understand that we are scholar-athletes and that the academic part is always going to come first for [my team], I still think that we can be very competitive in the pool and be one of the top programs in the country.”
Minnis also gained valuable insights into the inner workings of an athletic administration.
“Being a college coach, there is so much of the administrative stuff that you have to do,” Minnis said. “Working as an administrator, working with budgets, helped prepare me to get [the water polo coach job at Harvard].”
From his time with the Stanford women’s water polo club team, Minnis learned how to conduct practices efficiently and effectively under the guidance of a highly successful mentor in Stanford women’s water polo coach John Tanner.
“When it come to coaching water polo, that’s where I cut my teeth and learned how to do what I do,” Minnis said. “[Tanner] really taught me organization and how to look at the game, how to go from the beginning and break it down into small pieces and bring it up to that total end. He taught me how to be a teacher.”
While picking up lessons in organization and leadership, Minnis also incorporated much of the Stanford water polo mantra into his own coaching doctrine.
Even now, the Harvard men’s and women’s water polo run many of the same offensive and defensive systems that the No. 1 Cardinal women’s water polo team employs.
“The system we run is [Tanner’s] system,” Minnis said. “We might attack it differently, but the general basics are what I’ve done at Stanford for the last 12 years.”
Minnis stresses that defense is where every aspect of his game plans start.
“Everything starts on the defensive end,” Minnis said. “We’re going to get a stop on defense, we’re going to transition, we’re going to score a goal, and then we’re going to come back and get another stop. I like the up-tempo game; we like to stretch the pool and make them defend us two-meter to two-meter.”
For Minnis, collaboration with other coaches and other experts has been key. He has gone so far as to integrate some parts of his game plan from other sports.
“He’s always learning and surrounded himself with college level coaches always picking up new drills,” McIntosh said. “Him being open to other people’s feedback and always trying to learn more has helped his development over the years.”
For example, Minnis has incorporated plays from basketball, a sport that he has stayed close to over the years.
“One of our timeout plays is something that I have seen Tara Vanderveer from Stanford run,” Minnis said. “It’s worked. It’s a thing that she ran for Candace Wiggins.”
Yet another example of this collection was his removal of the tradition where freshman players would carry the team equipment on the road at away games.
“I always had freshman carry equipment on the road and stuff like that,” Minnis said. “I talked to other coaches and they said, ‘We don’t do that’. If we are going to consider ourselves a family, you wouldn’t have your little brother or sister always doing all the chores. You’re going to have to do some of the chores too.”
Minnis still remembers his first coaching job at Phillips Brooks with coach Stan Drake.
“One of the biggest things that I took away [from coaching with Drake] is to always have a smile on your face when you’re playing the sport and have fun with it,” Minnis said. “It’s not a job; we’re not out here solving world problems. We play the game we love, and we’re lucky to be playing it. My kids have bought into that, and they compete.”
His positive outlook on coaching has carried over from his early days juggling jobs at the meat company and at Menlo-Atherton High School.
“Working at the meat company—that has all kind of built who I am,” Minnis said. “I’m a leader, and I know I’m a leader, but I think I can lead by example and lead with a smile on my face and make [my team] enjoy what they’re doing. I think that’s the line.”
Minnis wants the Harvard student body and community to be equally excited for Harvard water polo and is working hard to make sure his teams are successful.
“My dad’s just a workhorse,” Josh Minnis said. “One of the main things that he focuses on when he is coaching is building up the sport from the ground up.”
When he is not spending time watching and re-watching game film and thinking about how he can make his team better, Minnis has been working on starting a club team at Harvard to get local youth interested in water polo and aquatics.
“I’d always love to see more minorities in general to be interested in aquatics,” Minnis said. “Especially water polo. It’s been such a big part of getting me to where I am.”
During his long journey to Harvard, Minnis has displayed commitment and focus to developing his players and his sport from scratch, just as he has developed his own philosophy and style as a coach over the years through hard work and persistence.
As a single, African-American father from a humble background who gave up so much for his son and his dream of being a college coach, Ted Minnis has finally found a home and a dream fulfilled at Harvard.

Having tragically missed Visitas as an actual prefrosh, I felt as if I was lacking a fundamental aspect of the Harvard Experience. This past weekend, I finally got my chance (again). Taking advantage of my journalistic skills and one semester of seventh grade drama class, I went undercover to experience the life of a prefrosh.
To get a head start on making prefrosh friends, I infiltrated the Harvard Class of 2016 Facebook group. When one student asked if anyone else was staying in the Quad, I said I would be in Weld (also in the Quad—right?).
On the actual weekend, I sported a 2016 backpack and a red folder (which I did not steal from an unsuspecting prefrosh). My disguise failed to startle any prefrosh, but a few current students were quite confused. I overheard one junior behind me say, "But I could have sworn she was in my section. I guess all white people look the same."
Outside Annenberg, a few students told me to come to an event in Canaday that would feature Finale.
I asked if that was a finals club.
Speaking with prefrosh was slightly (or extremely) awkward. I felt horrible misleading potential students, as they were so friendly and inclusive. But this did not stop me.
One student said something about the president of Harvard. I asked who the president was and, when she said, "Drew Faust," I asked if he was any good.
Another student said his bags were in Adams House. "Who is Adam?"
I was at least partially successful in making prefrosh think I was not a freshman, and I was completely successful in making them think I had no idea what was going on.
My last plan was to head to Boylston for a meet-and-greet sponsored by a Republican student organization on campus. However, due to a complete lack of attendance on the part of other prefrosh, my plans to mingle were foiled.
And so, after a weekend of scintillating ice-breakers, such as "What's your name?" "Where are you from?" and "Why are there so many ice-cream socials?" I was left to conclude that prefrosh are friendly, accepting of the ignorant, and overwhelmingly liberal.
