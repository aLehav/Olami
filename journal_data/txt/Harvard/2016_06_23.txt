After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston will be the site of the third U.S.-China Climate Leaders Summit, set to take place in 2017.
United States Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh made the announcement in Beijing earlier this month at the second-ever summit, which brought together American and Chinese leaders to discuss how the two world powers can combat climate change. The announcement follows an international climate change agreement signed in Paris last year, as well as the first U.S.-China Climate Leaders Summit, which took place in Los Angeles last September.
“We know we must be making investments now to create a more sustainable future for the world we share. I look forward to continuing these substantive, challenging conversations in Boston,” Walsh said during the announcement.
In Beijing, Kerry, a former U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, referred to Boston as a “leader on climate action” and noted the urgency of addressing climate change for coastal cities like Boston.
Last December, Boston released a “climate change vulnerability assessment,” which warned that by 2030, Cambridge may experience triple the number of days with temperatures above 90 degrees each year compared to 2015, and also identified several areas within Cambridge’s key infrastructure that were vulnerable to the increasing heat.
In 2014, Walsh also released a climate action plan that reiterated previous calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent by 2020.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
O’Neil A.S. Outar, senior associate dean and director of development for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, will leave his post early next month amid Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign.
Outar’s departure comes less than two years after he joined FAS in September 2014; before, he worked at the helm of the alumni and fundraising arm at the University of Alberta and fundraised for MIT. It is the second leadership change within FAS’s development office less than three years into the public phase of Harvard’s capital campaign.
“While Harvard does not comment on personnel matters, we thank Senior Associate Dean Outar for his service to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and will announce details of the search process for his replacement in the near future,” FAS spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement. Outar did not respond to requests for comment.
According to Harvard Magazine, Robert B. Cashion ’81, senior associate vice president for alumni affairs and development, will lead FAS’ development office on an interim basis. Cashion, who could not be reached for comment, previously served as acting Vice President for Alumni Affairs and Development and FAS development director.
Harvard surpassed its $6.5 billion capital campaign target earlier this year, setting a higher education fundraising record with two and a half years still left in the campaign.
That progress was fueled by several large gifts, including a historic $400 million pledge to the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson last June.
In recent months, FAS has turned its fundraising attention to the College’s House renewal project, which, as of late March, has raised $230 million towards a $450 million goal.
