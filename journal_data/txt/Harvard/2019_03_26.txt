After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The year 1987 saw the achievement of myriad musical milestones: Aretha Franklin became the first woman to be inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the now-lauded musicals “Into the Woods” and “Les Misérables” first opened in Broadway theaters. Massive hits such as Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” and Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” were first released, and some stars of today’s music scene — such as Kendrick Lamar and Frank Ocean — were born. And classical music was part of this flourishing scene as well: While the minimalist school arguably reached some of its greatest triumphs, contemporary-classical composers also wrote incredibly poignant, powerful music. Here are some highlights.
Reich’s “Electric Counterpoint”
One of minimalist composer Steve Reich’s most enduringly popular works, “Electric Counterpoint,” was first recorded in 1987. Orchestrated for an ensemble of guitars — or, alternatively, for solo electric guitar and tape — the three-movement piece makes significant use of digital audio and equipment, in line with the advent of electronic music at the time. Indeed, Pat Metheny, the performer in the piece’s inaugural recording, overdubs his tracks several times to capture Reich’s minimalist yet contrapuntal intent.
Glass’s “Violin Concerto No. 1”
Philip Glass, another composer known best for his contributions to the minimalist school, composed Violin Concerto No. 1 in honor of his late father, who preferred the concerti of Romantic composers like Mendelssohn and Brahms. As such, Glass wrote the piece in a decisively more traditional, lyrical manner. Indeed, the Violin Concerto marked a turn in Glass’s work toward more traditionally and timbrally accessible music.
Tower’s “Fanfare for the Uncommon Woman No. 1”
Inspired by Aaron Copland’s “Fanfare for the Common Man” written 45 years earlier, Joan Tower’s piece is dedicated to the conductor Marin Alsop. The work, written for brass and percussion, honors “uncommon women,” especially those like Tower and Alsop who have flourished in traditionally male-dominated fields. Tower went on to compose five more parts to the fanfare, finishing 10 years later in 1997.
Cage’s “As Slow As Possible”
“As Slow As Possible,” stylized “Organ2/ASLSP,” is an experimental work by composer John Cage for organ — there is no direct marking as to how slow the work should be played. As such, the length of the work can vary immensely in length. While typical performances of the piece at the piano last from between 20 to 70 minutes, many performances (especially at the organ) last far longer. “As Slow As Possible” is currently being played at the St. Burchardi Church in Halberstadt, Germany; the performance began in 2001 and is slated to finish in 2640.
Though 1987 was also met with some ends in classical music — among them the deaths of composers Dmitri Kabalevsky and Morton Feldman, cellist Jacqueline du Pré, and violinist Jascha Heifetz — it simultaneously bore witness to many significant developments and milestones, serving as the precursor to the flourishing environment of today’s contemporary-classical universe.

Teresa’s mind is the waiting room of the Venezuelan consulate on a Tuesday afternoon. Each of the four walls is coated in faded eggshell-white-turned-yellow paint, little corners and nooks peeling like dandruff off the great scalp of Bolivarian bureaucracy. The chairs line every flat surface, neatly crammed together. On the side tables, there are three or four copies of Spanish tabloids, pages papery like Latin skin exposed too long to unaccustomed cold and colors faded so they blend more into the walls with every passing day. There is a pressing emptiness about the consulate of Teresa’s mind, a slowness of pace that rivals that of even the most sun-soaked days on the beaches of the island of Margarita. On Tuesday afternoons, there are only ever two or three people in the waiting room at the same time. They are almost always elderly, wilting bodies wrapped in crepe paper button-downs or bird of paradise dresses whose colors fail to soar to the height of those shades from back home. As time passes, marked only by the moving arms of the occupants’ wristwatches, the young attendant manning the desk appears every few minutes, smacking wads of chewing gum or meticulously refilling her lined lips before disappearing again into the consulate’s maze of back offices. She never calls any names. Minutes melt into hours melt into days and the drone of the consulate’s television is never-ending. Not a word leaves the occupant’s parched lips as they sit, shrinking into their starched shirts in a slowly dominating fight between their timeworn memories and the stifling, sluggish heat of mundane red tape restrictions to this one’s citizenship or that one’s papers or whoever’s infinitesimal attempt at belonging.
Of course, to Maria Teresa, named after her grandmother, there is no windingly painful bureaucracy present. In fact, the words “bureaucracy” or “consulate” barely take up space in her mind—she has never felt the spinal compression that results from waiting for governmental redemption that does not come. Maria Teresa sits on the floor in front of her abuelita and registers only the derivation of emptiness, something she has come to associate with aging and reaching that stage in life where home seems more a distant sketch than a full color painting you live within. The television runs in the background, a similarity between their two worlds, but Maria Teresa pays it no attention. The steady murmur of Venezuelan news reporters is an all-too-familiar soundtrack to her visits to abuelita that are so rarely are allowed to give way to the singsong tones of mermaids and princesses and young girl explorers. Today her grandmother had promised to watch a movie with her but there were still two hours until their agreed upon time. To kill the time, Maria Teresa bounces two Polly Pockets around on the oatmeal colored carpet of her grandmother’s room.
The television in Teresa’s consulate brain crackles behind her eyes as though transmitted by one of those wire frame picture boxes of times long past. The occupants let it score their yearning, registering only a few common phrases.
“…two more hospitals in Caracas today reported losing complete power, taking the death toll of patients up to 15 in the last two days alone. Five of those were newborn children, as…”
“…still no words from Leopoldo Lopez, as he remains on house arrest. His wife…”
“…Nicolas Maduro gave a speech denouncing the call for nationwide protests, accusing the United States government of conspiring to overthrow his rightfully elected government. It is obvious, to the Venezuelan people, that it is a farce. Diosdado…”
Defeat follows disappointment follows dying supplies of righteous anger from the lungs of a population whose sore throat screams are mouse squeaks whimpers on the world stage. The news feed is such a common soundtrack that the first occurrence of a dissonant note does not register until it crescendos suddenly.
“…just in, president of the National Assembly Juan Guaidó has announced he is invoking article 233 of the Constitution, which dictates that in the event that there is no president elected, the president of the National Assembly must assume the interim presidency. Guaido has cited May 20’s fraudulent elections and their empowerment of a dictatorial government headed by a usurper as the right cause for invoking article 233 and stepping in as interim president until free and fair elections can be held. Guaidó was surrounded by protesters in Caracas while…”
A circuit shorts in the consulate and high flames of red, yellow, and blue engulf all surfaces. The occupants’ bodies contort, snakelike and melding into the rush and roar and redemption of the fire until all is a dancing mass of living burning reds, soaring yellows, sinuous blues, wildfire bodies jubilating to the clave beat of change.
Maria Teresa hears her abuelita before she feels her. There is first a sharp intake of breath and then the crashing wave of what she imagines asphyxiation sounds like.
“Abuelita!”
Before she can turn, Teresa has taken Maria Teresa in her arms. She holds her, tears escaping cataracted eyes so quickly Maria Teresa is caught in the whirlpool rush of her mother’s washing machine. Her grandmother’s arms squeeze her, constriction more akin to her mother’s still youthful arms than to the veiny trembling of Teresa’s life force. Her grandmother’s warbled cries shift, giving way to a word that Maria Teresa’s English-first brain cannot immediately discern. The word morphs like clay being shaped by the divine hands of Teresa’s histories, and fattens until it consumes Teresa’s little ears.
“Finalmente.”
Finalmente.

“Guestbook: Ghost Stories” proudly claims on its back cover that this collage of images, listings, quasi-Instagram pictures, and one-page short stories “explores the visitations that haunt us in the midst of life, and reinvents the very way we narrate experience.” This statement is true: Even flipping through the pages produces a kind of eeriness in the reader — one tinged with an uncertainty entirely unrelated to the ghost stories themselves. Instead, the reader is led through a maze of disjointed collections of images and prose that should evoke a sense of hauntedness but instead fall flat. The familiarity of the imagery — seeing as it seeks to capture the mundane moments that make up our daily lives — lacks enough clarification to inspire the strangeness that author Leanne Shapton is going for, leaving the reader to flip through the pages in confusion.
There are good moments, however. Shapton, one of the authors of “Women in Clothes” along with Sheila Heti and Heidi Julavits, presents a story called “Billy Byron” in the early pages of the book. “Billy Byron” follows the tennis prodigy from birth through his depression and rise to fame. The story ends with his implied suicide in a way that is both poignant and jarring. Shapton marries photographs from throughout his life with captions that keep the eye moving continuously. This rapid progression creates an anticipation that propels the story towards its end. “Billy Byron,” and other chapters — if they can indeed be called such — remind 21st century readers the importance of an image and how much people, even in an Instagram-saturated world, are hungry for images that transcend their time and touch them in ways that require prolonged scrutiny, instead of cursory double-taps.
“Peele House” is likely the most haunting of all the chapters and is an excellent example of the theme Shapton fails to capture throughout many of the others. Peele House, built in New York in 1931, appears in multiple photographs as the house passed from owner to owner, perhaps because more than one woman suffered a miscarriage there while many others reported strange noises and leaking water with no apparent source. The black and white photos, as well as their captions, are ethereal and remind the reader of what is so unsettling about old, creaky houses: a sense of being watched.
Other highlights of this collection include a curation of “Instagram photos,”  called such because of the varying number of likes below each one, and a perfect description of shyness:“I’d always thought she was chilly, but when we were sat next to each other at dinner and got to talking about books and people we both knew, I realized her shyness was the blurry, foggy kind — reserved, but not cold." “Georgehythe Place,” a short photo-illustration of a family living in the chapter’s namesake mansion, has its fair share of eerie deaths and mysteriously unidentifiable “water stains,” while a beautiful array of vintage dresses accompanies a short description of how the woman who bought it felt when she wore it or first looked at it. These chapters all act as curations of the images that have an inexplicable power to touch the viewer. Collected together and told as part of a larger narrative, they are truly striking in both their ability to capture a lost past and maintain the curiosity of a contemporary reader.
The confusing bits, however, are just that: confusing. Unfortunately, they occur often enough to bury the otherwise compelling parts of “Guestbook” among the many baffling pages. “Who is this Who is Coming?” is a 10-page spread of nearly identical pictures of a veil: There is no explanation to accompany the black and white images. The reader, supposedly, must fill in the blanks, to the point that it feels like Shapton did not do her due diligence in crafting each collection carefully enough. “Public Figure Beauty Lover Digital Talent Traveler Spinario Parma | Abu Dhabi” is a short “poem,” though what it really is is anyone’s guess, composed entirely of compliments about a woman’s dress. The premise is intriguing, to be sure, but the problem that resurfaces constantly throughout reading “Guestbook” is that many of Shapton’s chapters are intriguing without actually doing the narrative work required to evoke the sense of haunting that the collection promises.
Certainly Shapton’s method of telling a story is not conventional, and there are a few moments when this attempt at breaking literary boundaries does work. But the experience is much akin to panning for gold: searching, desperately, for a small glimmer amid the dirt and silt. Unfortunately, many of the stories within this book could be interesting and could elicit some emotional connection, yet the elements needed to create this feeling are either too small to be registered, or non-existent. The photographs and illustrations themselves are striking, many of them capturing the mundanity of everyday life, but these images do not stand on their own: They need more from their author, and Shapton ultimately does not deliver.

As Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote, “If thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze into thee.” At one point or another, everyone has stared at their reflection in a mirror and wondered, if only for the briefest of moments, if there was something looking back. This fear, and the deeper question of one’s own hidden nature, fuels “Us,” Jordan Peele’s latest psychological horror film. After his widely acclaimed debut, “Get Out,” it was unclear whether Peele would be able to live up to the legacy of his first film. In comparison to its predecessor, “Us” falls a bit short in depth and intrigue, but is still an extremely technical and captivating film that confirms Jordan Peele’s status as one of Hollywood’s most promising and capable storytellers.
To get away from their busy lives, the Wilson family takes a vacation to Santa Cruz, California. Unbeknownst to the other family members, the family’s matriarch, Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), is haunted by a traumatic event that happened on the Santa Cruz beach when she was a little girl. One night, the demons from her past return, and the Wilsons suddenly find themselves terrorized by their scissor-wielding doppelgängers.
There are many things that the film gets right, be it the likable characters, the moments of levity interspersed among the dark ones, or the captivating imagery and themes that continuously reappear. However, for a horror film to ultimately succeed, it must be scary. “Us” is scary. 20th century directors artistically generated fear through music, atmosphere, lighting, and disturbing images and events. In recent years, the horror genre has tended to stray away from these tactics, popularizing cheap “jump scares,” loud noises or sudden movements to get viewers’ hearts racing. Peele opts for the former and builds a terrifying experience through his intuitive understanding of how the best horror films work.
Harvard professor Steven Schlozman aptly explained in his TED Talk “What horror films teach us about ourselves and being human” that horror films are most effective when they utilize two concepts: violations of patterns and the feeling of dread. Pattern violation occurs when viewers see familiar concepts in unfamiliar circumstances. These violations generate strong feelings of uncertainty and fear in viewers. For instance, when people see a clown at a circus, they recognize the clown and that it belongs. When people see a clown in a storm drain, they perceive the clown but realize that it should not be in this context. This pattern violation generates fear, and Peele handles these violations masterfully in “Us.” When the doppelgänger family first appears, they are instantly recognizable and familiar, and one can instantly understand that they should not be standing at the end of a driveway, hand-in-hand, shrouded in complete darkness. Such uncanny, disturbing images and pattern violations recur through the entirety of the film and make for an endlessly frightening, thrilling viewing experience.
Furthermore, the pervasive feeling of dread is crucial in setting the film’s ambience. After their initial introduction, there are no doubts as to the goal of the doppelgänger family. If they manage to get ahold of the Wilson family, they will kill them. This impending and unresolved threat adds tension and suspense to every scene, as the doppelgängers can be hiding anywhere and can appear at any time.
Peele expertly crafts the imagery and themes that recur throughout the film. He relies heavily on shadows and reflections to represent his characters’ dual natures. It is fascinating to see where these reflections pop up, and their unpredictable apparitions further elevate the sense of dread, as Peele insinuates that the Wilson family and their doppelgängers are never truly apart. His use of sound is also impressively nuanced. Rather than opting for loud, grating music, Peele interjects scenes of heavy silence, where each sound can be nerve-wracking.
The true gems of the film, however, are the actors themselves. Each actor plays both a “real” character and that character’s terrifying doppelgänger. All of the actors, including a precociously talented 10-year-old Evan Alex, make each character feel genuine and believable. Nyong’o gives the film’s standout performance as both Adelaide Wilson and her doppelgänger, Red. Her portrayal of Red is awe-inspiring, and she is completely believable in both roles. Nyong’o’s performance is as remarkable and Oscar-worthy as any given by an actor this decade.
That being said, “Us” is not perfect. Some plot points feel extraneous and confusing, and the film would’ve been improved by their exclusion. To that same effect, Peele tries to provide some clues into and explanations for the strangeness of the characters’ circumstances, but the intricacies of these explanations may be lost during an initial viewing. The film’s allegory also becomes muddled and confused as a result. However, one might find these problems rectified upon a second viewing. Starting over at the beginning with all the pieces of the puzzle makes it easier to spot the subtle clues that Peele weaves throughout the film and reveals how he has skillfully crafted the narrative. Watch the film once for the thrills and scares. Watch it twice for the deeper meaning.
Despite the film’s minor shortcomings, “Us” is another impressive addition to the horror genre. Peele’s mastery of horror techniques, his innovative approach to traditional ones, and the film’s strong cast make “Us” a film that shouldn’t be missed. With Peele’s legacy cemented, it will be interesting to see what he makes in the future. Whatever he makes next will have the world’s attention.

It’s hard to review a teen romance drama.
Sure, they have changed over time. Outfits become less denim-heavy and technology more touchscreen-centric, journal entries become vlogs and online chat rooms in "A Cinderella Story" (2004) become FaceTime calls in “Sierra Burgess is a Loser” (2018). Sometimes, the changes aren’t insignificant — “Love, Simon” (2018) and “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” (2018), for example, brought refreshing representation to a genre that’s almost exclusively populated by straight, white characters.
In the end, however, the tropes are almost always the same: the repressed romantic tension-filled first encounter, the goofy but supportive sidekick/best friend, the falling-in-love montage sequence, the dramatic moments of heightened tension and their tear-jerking resolutions. Not all teen romances follow this formula, but “Five Feet Apart,” for the most part, does.
A chalkboard with a sappy, motivational quote scrawled out in cursive; photos of constellations and watercolors of the ocean thumbtacked to the wall; friends dropping by to eat junk food and chat about boys — in the opening scene, Stella Grant (Haley Lu Richardson) seems like just another teenage protagonist. But as soon as her friends walk out the door, she puts on her oxygen tube, and the viewer is introduced — in vlog form, of course — to the life of a teenage cystic fibrosis patient. Stella takes us through her daily routine meticulously: scheduling her treatments, FaceTiming her best friend Poe (Moises Arias), and crossing things off her to-do list (which itself is depicted more often than her actually completing the items). This routine is disrupted by one suave, too-cool-for-the-hospital, obligatorily dreamy Augustus Waters — er, Will Newman (Cole Sprouse).
Stella, who is Will’s Hazel Grace, does much of the expositional work for the viewer. “You’re the kind of guy who ignores the rules because it makes him feel in control,” she says, within 30 seconds of meeting Will. His quip oozes with melodrama: “It’s just life. It’ll be over before you know it.” The two, who are already standing six feet apart to not catch each other’s CF bacteria, are further separated by Barb (Kimberly Hebert Gregory), the endearing, caring nurse who seems to be the only one who’s keeping the teenagers alive — but it’s too late. Stella and Will, within the first hour, have gone from being fundamentally antagonistic to inexplicably in love. What follows is a sort of hour-long push and pull: Stella and Will push that six foot limit, in a triumphant declaration that is probably medically unsound, to five feet, as Barb tries desperately to pull them apart, and Poe flits about pushing and pulling on everyone’s heartstrings with his quirky but unwaveringly kind antics.
Poe is the real star of the film. Arias makes the most of the hackneyed best friend role to which he has been relegated; his quirks are endearing, his jokes land, and his quips draw chuckles. In response to Will asking why he hasn’t made a move on Stella, he retorts, “It’s because she’s not a he.” One of his scenes in the second half ends up being one of the most poignant and touching in the whole film — to elaborate on it would be to spoil the film.
Other actors surprise with impactful performances. Gregory gives a powerful performance as Barb, illuminating the strength, willpower, and care that so many nurses embody. Stella does a fair bit of illuminating herself; she shares with the world the often unsung experiences of cystic fibrosis patients, who make up around 30,000 cases per year in the United States. At times, the film is a touch too melodramatic. In one scene that is supposed to be romantic but that is almost as cringy as the rom-com staple of a flirtatious billiard game, Will and Stella are in adjacent hospital beds, screaming and refusing to leave each others’ sides while hospital workers struggle to separate them.
For the most part, “Five Feet Apart” checks off all the boxes: Expect to chuckle liberally, cringe occasionally, and cry inevitably, although not quite when one would expect. For those who appreciate a good tear-jerking teen romance, expect a reaction similar to “The Fault in Our Stars” back in 2014 — it probably won’t be winning any Oscars any time soon, but who cares?

Accessible programming is a dangerous game. Landmark works in the classical canon come loaded with decades of interpretations, which not only heighten the listener’s expectations, but wear on the ear. Each tension and resolution slowly transforms a musical experience into familiar transaction — undemanding, but perhaps less rewarding too.
The Handel and Haydn Society confronted this risk head-on on March 10 with a high-octane performance of a well-worn program, featuring Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 and Mozart’s “Magic Flute” overture, a risk which paid off. Despite the concert being a clear crowd-pleaser, the charismatic orchestra seemed to triumph in spite of the program, not because of it, which raises the question: What soaring heights could this orchestra reach given a fresher musical challenge?
In a sense, this was a concert with two beginnings. In a surprise addition to the program, listeners were first treated to a Collaborative Youth Concert, the culmination of a months-long education project, bringing together Handel and Haydn Society musicians and various high school choruses for a collaborative performance of Handel’s “Zadok the Priest.” Though programmatically disjointed from the rest of the concert, the performance showcased a remarkable level of choral skill and musical intelligence from the young musicians, under the lively direction of Emily Isaacson.
The orchestra first took on a unified sound, however, with the entrance of maestro Matthew Halls — the chemistry between conductor and ensemble truly brought the stage to life. From the jubilant opening chords of “The Magic Flute” overture, the orchestra seemed to speak for the first time.
Halls undeniably has a special ability to unite the ensemble. Key to Sunday’s performance was a palpable electricity between the conductor and the orchestra. As a group, the Handel and Haydn Society is far from the rigidity of conventional modern orchestras, instead using the concept of historic performance as an access point to a communal and dynamic performance practice. The result is a homogenous sound and a real feeling of investment from each individual player. In this performance, the ensemble’s sound felt so complete as a singular body that at times there was tension with soloist Eric Hoeprich ’76 in Weber Clarinet concerto, where famous virtuosic passages in the solo line were perhaps not as mellifluous and flush with the ensemble as possible. Hearing Hoeprich sensitively interpret the work on a period instrument, however — in this case, a timbrally fascinating replica of the original instrument for which Weber composed the work — was a rare and distinct pleasure.
The main course of the concert was, of course, Beethoven. Almost a victim of its cultural prevalence, from cult classic recordings to that notorious Walter Murphy disco instrumental most of us would rather forget, those tempestuous opening four notes are jarringly immortalized in classical music memory. It was therefore particularly apt that Halls, with borderline irreverence, thundered the opening motif into being before the audience had even ceased to clap. Discarded alongside the opening notes were notions of a tired and overwrought Beethoven performance. Given the legacy of the work, the Handel and Haydn Society’s claim in the program of an “ink-not-quite-dry” performance is barely conceivable, yet through sheer force of personality the Handel and Haydn Society came dangerously close to its goal. Indeed, the Handel and Haydn Society’s real triumphs lie in moments of spontaneous vigour, and Halls utilized this power to borderline excess, blasting through the symphony with an ecstatic buoyancy that overcame expectations and transported the listener.
This was not to say the performance was without its nuance — Halls’s historical performance sensibilities combined with the distinct sonorities of a period orchestra unveiled subtle colorings often hidden in modern orchestral renditions. The fourth movement in particular highlighted a sonically diverse wind section, the bassoon especially being a rare textural delight. However, the true victor of the concert was the piccolo, an almost outlandishly conspicuous, penny-whistle-like presence in the heroic finale to the symphony.
Sunday’s performance was undeniably a pleasure to experience, and on many levels deeply satisfying for the listener — this was reflected in the enthusiastic audience response that day. But the Handel and Haydn Society’s success in interpreting the familiar hints at a far greater, untapped potential. Throughout its 2018–2019 season, the Handel and Haydn Society has played it safe, sticking to landmark works of the classical repertoire, and in all its power to convincingly tell a story, the orchestra this year is leaving a plethora of experiences and narratives unexplored. Sunday night’s concert made a strong case for the continued relevance of period orchestras, but what would be more compelling is the development of a real musical footprint. The idea of reinventing classic repertoire is not a new one. To truly take the listener on a journey, the orchestra must showcase not only the classics we know, but bring us the classics we will come to discover.

As much as “Transit” is about displacement and flux, it is equally concerned with the pursuit of stability and a sense of home. In his latest film, German director Christian Petzold of “Barbara” and “Phoenix” fame triumphantly brings to life the poignant story of a German man fleeing fascism during World War II. By setting this neo-noir love story in contemporary France, he lends the film an intense feeling of urgency that demands its story be told.
“Transit” is based on Anna Segher’s 1944 novel of the same name. It traces the life of Georg (Franz Rogowski), a frustrated young radio technician who attempts to help one of his friends, Heinz (Ronald Kukulies), escape Paris to Marseille. At this time, many refugees crowd Marseille in the hopes of acquiring transit documents from various consulates in order to travel internationally. Though Heinz dies during their attempted escape, Georg forges into Marseille alone to bring the news of Heinz’s death to his wife and young son, Melissa (Maryam Zaree) and Driss (Lilien Batman). Around this time, Georg comes across the letters, travel documents, and the last unpublished work of Franz Weidel, a communist writer who has recently committed suicide. Once in Marseille, Georg adopts the identity of the dead writer in order to gain safe passage to Mexico. When Georg falls in love with a mysterious woman called Marie (Paula Beer), the plot becomes all the more complicated as she turns out to be Weidel’s estranged wife. Marie does not know that her husband has died, nor does she realize that her husband’s movements, which she traces carefully every day, are in fact those of another man entirely.
Part of what makes the film so compelling is its central characters. Though he is in the process of fleeing the country, Georg rapidly establishes relationships with kind neighbors and fellow fugitives, who challenge his decision to leave. His fatherly relationship with Driss is particularly touching, adding a softness to Georg’s rather haunted character. His relationship with Marie develops incredibly quickly, almost to the point where it might seem unbelievable, but the chemistry between Rogowski and Beer is clear from the outset. Theirs is a relationship that is not easy to understand, because Marie is consumed by a torrid of feelings for the different men in her life, but Beer beautifully portrays this indecision and volatility in a way that makes her character’s complexities more understandable.
With his precise ability to capture the briefest moments and smallest details, Georg is clearly a born storyteller. Rogowski plays him exquisitely, emphasizing Georg’s gravitational pull and charisma. Throughout, Rogowski maintains an intense expression that is at once full of trauma and wistfulness that naturally appeals to the character’s around him. His expression and air are so compelling that even the audience cannot help but be invested in his fate.
Rogowki also imbues Georg with an empathy that makes all the other characters want to tell him their stories. This is why Georg finds himself constantly running into the same refugees and forced to hear their stories, all dark and harrowing — one German Jewish woman has been stuck in the city for months and must bring the dogs of American tourists back to the US in exchange for safe passage and documents to start a life across the Atlantic. As the characters tell their stories, their narrations interrupt each other’s, as Petzold employs an editing technique that blends together the characters’ stories to create one massive tableau of despair.
With its limited music and narration, the film establishes its moody and rather old Hollywood-like atmosphere early on. The film’s minimal soundtrack, with its occasional somber piano riffs and guitar strums, allows the viewer to focus on small cinematic details like the pregnant silences within the dialogue and lengthened moments of suspense. A constant narration running throughout the film creates a sense of fatality, as the narrator knows what will eventually happen to the protagonist. The irony is deep: Part of why Georg is so attracted to Weidel’s last novel is because he enjoys the sense of control he has over the characters by knowing their fates.
By transporting the story to present day France, Petzold makes the film multidimensional. That brilliant choice not only distinguishes it from other period films, but also allows the viewer to focus on the characters and their relationships. Though costumes and extensive sets usually set the atmosphere of war films, this pared-down set and costuming help convey the intricacies of the plot. Contemporary Marseille, with its growing number of immigrants, is the perfect setting for representing a city with countless numbers of WWII refugees seeking visas to escape from an increasingly real and terrifying vision of a fascist Europe.
Altogether, the film has a clear, beautiful vision. At once melancholy and touching, “Transit” is not content with being a tear-jerker or just another WWII drama. Petzold distinguishes it with its almost psychological diagnostic of complicated human relationships and displacement. It’s an immaculate and nuanced study of hope and desire that will foster conversation about immigration and the ever present shadow of fascism that colors the world to this day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Memorial Church opened its doors on March 9 to welcome performers from around the world in its inaugural “Help the Children” Benefit Concert, held to raise money and awareness for immigration rights at the U.S.-Mexico border.
With performances from a range of Boston area musicians — Boston Camerata, Blue Heron Acapella, the Choral Fellows of Harvard, Dünya, Fabián Gallón, Eduardo Betancourt, and Black Nativity — audience members tapped their feet and quietly hummed to themselves around the sanctuary. As the concert came to its close, the event’s organizers asked for donations to aid refugees and immigrants, especially children and fractured families along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Joel I. Cohen, Music Director Emeritus of Boston Camerata and Artistic Director and founder of Camerata Mediterranea, was the concert’s host and organizer. He spoke about music’s ability to impact global issues.
“Little children respond to musical sounds with a smile or a tapping foot. It’s so basic within humanity. It has the gift of federating people,” Cohen said. “They hear something they may not have heard otherwise — the Arabic mode, a weird instrument — and say, ‘I can relate to that.’”
No ordinary fundraising event, the benefit kicked off with a Sephardic-Moroccan piece, “Criado, Hasta Cuando.” The pieces that followed were of medieval, renaissance, and contemporary origins, and genres spanned from opera to modern nativity music. Instruments included the tiple (the Colombian national instrument) and Venezuelan harp. A song performed by soprano Anne Azéma, flautist Jesse Lepkoff, and nay player Boujemaa Razgui echoed off the church’s walls.
The Cambridge Legal Defense Fund and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) received all the proceeds from the concert, which was organized as a surprise for the two organizations. Geeta Pradhan, President of the Cambridge Community Foundation and leader of the Cambridge Legal Defense Fund, said she was was deeply touched by the sentiment and effort of the Memorial Church and Camerata Mediterranea to put together the concert.
“You help one family and you help generations,” Pradhan said.
Edward E. Jones, Gund University Organist and Choir Master, said he sees advocacy and music as “going hand in hand.”
“I feel that choral music especially is one of the great equalizers because you don’t need money for it. Everyone can sing,” Jones said.
“I’m an immigrant. I’m a citizen now, but I came over here. America is the great land of opportunity. That’s the way this country was founded.” Jones said. “I think people forget that today. Right now, in the terms of just responsibility to your fellow human being, we all have a moral obligation to be thinking about these things and doing something about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the tradition of sitting on the Met steps to cotillion balls to brunch at Sarabeth’s, “Gossip Girl” shaped the 2000s understanding of what it meant to be an elite teenager growing up in New York City. Described as “every parent’s worst nightmare” by the Parents Television Council when it first aired, the series touched on several controversial topics and glamorized bad behavior from every character. However, as a piece of fiction, “Gossip Girl” is a television masterpiece that gave us some of the most quoted one-liners from TV, from the series’ opening sequence — “And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. XOXO, GossipGirl” — to Blair Waldorf’s iconic “three words, eight letters. Say it and I'm yours.” Although most millennials fall on a spectrum from “I transferred to Columbia so I could be like Blair and Serena” to “I never understood the hype,” it would be difficult to find someone whose childhood was not influenced by this show in some way. Warning: Major spoilers ahead.
5. “Last Tango, Then Paris” (Season 3, Episode 22)
The third season ended on the biggest cliffhanger of the entire series, which is only part of what makes this episode so dramatic. Blair is finally ready to meet Chuck on the top of the Empire State Building, but she cannot make it in time because Dorota goes into labor and they rush to the hospital. Chuck then sleeps with Jenny because they are both lonely, only to realize that Blair intended to meet him all along. As Chuck begins to propose to Blair, Dan punches him, having learned what happened with Jenny, and Blair is distraught at the news. She jets to Paris with Serena for the summer (as one does). The last scene shows Chuck mugged and left for dead in Prague, as he refused to give up the ring that was supposed to be Blair’s.
4. “You’ve Got Yale!” (Season 2, Episode 16)
Watch this episode when you’re preparing for college decisions madness. Dan, Serena, and Blair all want to get into Yale, but only Dan and Serena are accepted. Serena lies about getting in because Blair was waitlisted and she’s tormented because she figured out she actually doesn’t want to go to Yale. Ah, first world problems. From lying and backstabbing to hazing a teacher, this episode has it all. Don’t get in Blair Waldorf’s way when she wants something.
3. “The Treasure of Serena Madre” (Season 3, Episode 11)
The Thanksgiving episodes are iconic. This “treasure” of an episode is abound with lies, lies, and more lies. Blair believes her mother is pregnant and hilarity ensues as she tries to out her. Meanwhile, Serena is forced to endure dinner with the man she is sleeping with (who happens to be the brother of one of her best friends) and his wife. One of the best scenes of the entire series occurs at the Thanksgiving table while “Watcha Say” by Jason Derulo plays, as everything comes out at once and each character storms away from the table in succession. The ensemble of characters should probably “keep it in the family,” but most of them aren’t even related.
2. “Blair Waldorf Must Pie” (Season 1, Episode 9)
Another Thanksgiving episode? These annual holiday episodes are too iconic to leave out, and season one’s drama-filled rendition will always take the cake. If you hated Blair before, you felt for her after this episode which reveals her struggles with an eating disorder. Intermixed with flashbacks from the Thanksgiving before, this episode also revealed how Dan and Serena first met, contrasting Dan’s past pining after his dream girl with their present relationship. The bathtub water-fight flashback is also adorable, while subtly foreshadowing Nate cheating on Blair with Serena. The episode ends with a brief respite from the drama as each separate family forgives and bonds with each other, marking one of the only times in the series where all is well.
1. “Hi, Society” (Season 1, Episode 10)
From the glamour of cotillion to finding out that grandma doesn’t always know best, this episode marked the epitome of Upper East Side glamour and scandal. It gave us the inside look into debutante balls and elite society that many of us would never have been able to experience. It also highlighted the toxicity of that world, as we see little Jenny lie to and berate her poor mother, corrupted by the need to fit in. Meanwhile, Dan stands up to CeCe. He and Serena leave the ball together blissfully happy, while Rufus learns why Lily left him all those years ago and we see the blossoming of their newfound love. Also, Nate and Blair finally sleep together to the score of Timbaland’s rendition of “Apologize” — an iconic early 2000s bop — while Chuck watches, and we get a sense that beneath his cold exterior lies an actual human heart. From the soundtrack to the sparkles, this episode was a whirlwind thrill from start to end.

15 milliseconds — that’s the time it takes for a hummingbird to do a single flap of its wings. It’s also the time that characters in “The Hummingbird Project” hope to transmit stock trade information across the country through a fiber optic cable. The link between the hummingbird and the stock exchange is much like the feel of the film: whimsical and amusing, yet shrouded in haziness without a clear direction.
The lack of clarity starts with the messy plot. Vincent (Jesse Eisenberg) and Anton Zaleski (Alexander Skarsgård), a fast talker-and-brains duo of high-frequency traders on Wall Street, are cousins who plan to make big bank on the stock exchange by building a fiber-optic cable that stretches underground from Kansas to New Jersey. What are they up against? Here’s where the mess begins: The Zaleskis face Eva Torres (Salma Hayek) — their menacing former boss who wields threats and resources above their heads — reluctant Amish landlords, the Appalachian mountains to dig through, the difficulty of finding an algorithm that’s fast enough to make all of the cables actually worth putting through, and a hard-hitting medical diagnosis for Vinny. Despite the film’s clumsy attempt at complexity, “The Hummingbird Project” ultimately shines because of the jumble of story threads that threaten to undermine it — that’s where the film gets its somewhat eccentric edge.
Director Kim Nguyen crafts interesting subplots promisingly, but disappointingly, he falls short of developing them. In a two hour runtime, however, there wasn’t room for much development. Nguyen showcases plenty of the gory details of Vinny’s illness, yet the illness doesn’t seem to ever pose a real threat until everything else also falls apart. Eisenberg brings the same spite and eagerness to Vincent as he did for Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network,” but his character isn’t quite as fleshed out. Instead, the film is full of could-have-beens: In one scene, Vinny floats down a frozen river in a raft somewhere in the middle of Pennsylvania, opening up about the struggles of growing up as the child of Russian immigrants — only to never again give the audience a glimpse into his childhood and his personal life.
Hayek pulls off a badass Cruella de Vil-like performance as Eva, strutting her heels and commanding immense power. Skarsgård is barely recognizable with his receding hairline as quirky, geeky, but still endearing Anton. The film’s funniest scenes are ones that spotlight Anton’s nerdiness. It’s only fitting that he spends most of the film in front of multiple monitors in his hotel room, trying to find a way to cut the speed of transaction down by one millisecond for the network he and Vinny are building.
Nguyen tries to meaningfully explore the well-worn question: What’s the point of winning on Wall Street? It’s not that Nguyen should’ve answered this question directly, but the lack of answers provided in the film is unsettling. Nguyen never clarifies Vinny and Anton’s intentions, aside from maybe a shallow interest in money. But that’s not really it. Anton supposedly wants to live in a reclusive country home working on his “codes,” and at times it seems like he’s motivated purely by a desire to not disappoint Vinny. Even with his social awkwardness and genius, he seems more emotionally complex than he lets on. Vinny, perhaps a little more blatantly, is driven by a wish to beat the ticking clock of life given his medical diagnosis, but ironically sacrifices his health by devoting himself to this insane project. Nguyen’s commentary on Wall Street and its lifestyle is not quite subtle here, but also does not amount to a meaningful commentary either.
“The Hummingbird Project” is a thought-provoking film, one that tackles a different Wall Street story. Instead of the tale of debauchery of “The Wolf of Wall Street,” the informative narrative of “The Big Short,” or the overly dramatic plots that define so many other films about banking, “The Hummingbird Project” is refreshing because it is about a venture that is as much of a physical endeavor as it is an intellectual one. But Nguyen also tries to prove that a highly-technical and complicated Wall Street story can be just as much about a construction project, a terminal illness, a geeky-cult industry, and a family alliance, until it is no longer clear what the film is really about. The film contains figments of these curious side stories. Its flaw is the sheer unmanageable number of these figments, and the looseness in which Nguyen ties them together.

Forget America’s iconic snacks. Forget the supermarket mountains of Lays, Coca-Cola, and Oreos. Forget the brainwashing snack commercials I watched every afternoon on Nickelodeon as a kid. For as long as I can remember, my sister and I have both agreed that Asian snacks reign supreme in taste and quality, especially compared to their American counterparts. My sister and I would go on what became our sentimental snack safaris, waltzing down the aisles of Nijiya Market, a supermarket in the heart of San Francisco’s Japantown, mesmerized by rainbows of flavored treats and charming Hello Kitty and Pikachu packaging. We always picked up the largest basket at the front of the store, knowing we would bring it back overflowing with spicy curry instant noodles, thin nori strips, and strawberry Pocky.
The one obstacle between our basket and the cashier was our mom. Before we could line up at the register, she would prod our basket and pick out snacks she had not seen before.
“Girls, this is ‘Made in China.’ Can you try to find another snack?”
On command, we sulked back to the aisle and scoured for alternatives. Our mom would approve of any snack Made in America whereas anything made in Japan, Indonesia, or any other Asian country would prompt another round of awkward questioning. I now wonder as a third-generation Chinese American if my friends had similar experiences when purchasing Asian snacks. I also wonder if scrutinizing food labels for its country of origin is just another facet of American culture my parents had adopted.
My mom is not alone. A 2015 Consumer Reports survey reported that eight in 10 Americans prefer American made goods over foreign products. What’s more, they are willing to dish out more money, 10 percent to be exact, for these American goods. The trustworthiness of American products even extends to foreign countries. In a 2017 Nielsen report, an overwhelming majority of Chinese and Taiwanese consumers preferred foreign-based commodities to local goods.
When it comes to country of origin labels, China faces the harshest scrutiny. In a 2010 CBS News article titled “Made in China = Piece of Junk,” author Geoffrey James sharply criticizes his defective purchases from China. Shortly after, he praises the longevity of his child’s toys from Ohio. James shares a belief held by many Americans: that “the entire United States is flooded with low-quality, poorly-manufactured crap made in China.” In the same spirit, Peter Navarro, a Huffington Post columnist, has curated a list titled “Six Great Reasons to ‘Don’t Buy Made in China’ This Holiday Season.”
The media tends to fixate on manufacturing scares in China. In 2008, many were mortified when inspectors discovered melamine, a chemical used in plastic, in the popular white rabbit candy. The Chinese government, equally alarmed by this scare, deployed thousands of inspectors to the factory sites. Despite this rapid and thorough response, this incident continually gets referenced as China’s manufacturing downfall by critics like James and Navarro. Most media outlets, including The New York Times, have also continued the trend of exposing the many risks of Chinese manufacturing rather than its economic benefits and cleaner than perceived standards.
Countries have even found ways to obscure China’s country label. Fearful of isolating customers like my mom, Japanese manufacturers changed labels from “Made in China” to “Made in the PRC” (Public’s Republic of China). While many of these reports and responses raise an alarming truth, the emphasis on China as the chief offender draws attention away from other countries with similarly lackluster standards.
The origin of food labeling dates back to the mid-twentieth century. According to the Tariff Act of 1930, manufacturers must list their products’ country of origin to pass customs. Specifically, retailers had to include the phrase “Made in” on every food package they sold. More recently, under The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, the government required that retailers generate country of origin labels (COOLs) for beef, lamb, pork, and fish and eventually nuts and perishable produce. As COOLs gained universal traction, consumers took notice.
While obsessing over COOLs can be valid, they of course do not reveal a product’s full story. A product’s origin does not ensure a higher standard of food safety. Additionally, processed products with ingredients from multiple countries cannot be summed up in one COOL. Labeling presents one source of knowledge, but it cannot provide all the information a consumer needs to make an informed choice.
Harmful stereotypes about certain countries that extend beyond the food industry can also influence how people categorize food and snacks. Throughout history, people have perceived the Chinese government as corrupt with scanty regulation. As a result, people view Chinese products as insufficiently supervised and inferior. With the rise of the Chinese economy, other countries may galvanize a sense of nationalism or xenophobia by avoiding Chinese products. With its negative image perpetuated in media by critics, China has unjustly amassed an image of a complacency and poor quality manufacturing.
Leaders in China nonetheless want to improve manufacturing in all sectors, including food. With the launch of “Made in China 2025,” Chinese companies have implemented production cycles rooted in quality rather than quantity. With some exceptions, “Made in China” products are no longer synonymous with low-quality goods, as evidenced by the rise of tech companies Huawei and Xiaomi and other luxury brands. Unfortunately, this ascent has been overshadowed by people’s initial perceptions of China.
In the Asian supermarkets, my mom taught me to deeply care about and question food safety, counterfeit goods, and nutrition. For that, I am grateful. But I have come to acknowledge that COOLs do not provide a full picture of a product’s inputs. We should enter Asian supermarkets cognizant about food safety, but it’s unfair to avoid eating white rabbit candy just because it says “Made in China” — you would be missing out.
— Contributing writer Jess L. Eng’s column, "Takeaways From Chinese America," wrestles with the possibilities and boundaries of food culture from a third-generation Chinese American perspective.

Love, passion, and betrayal come together in the incredibly sluggish and hackneyed story better suited for a soap opera in director James Kent’s “The Aftermath,” about a woman, her husband, and a widower struggling to live together in a post-World War II Germany. Keira Knightley stars as the troubled and lonely wife Rachael Morgan, whose husband, British colonel Lewis Morgan (Jason Clarke), is too engrossed sympathizing with the destitute Germans to spend time with his wife. Enter Stefan Lubert (Alexander Skarsgård), a widower and the former owner of the house into which Rachael and Lewis move. When Lewis travels for work and leaves Rachael alone with Lubert for a couple of days, sparks fly and emotions run wild as the two seemingly find happiness in each other’s arms. It’s a short-lived affair, though, and the supposedly happy ending is instead confusing and dissatisfying. The love story is not as intense or thrilling as it should be, but is weighed down by superficial characters and a tedious plot that fails to take advantage of its historical backdrop. Ultimately the film becomes an overly dramatic and shallow tale of a romance gone wrong.
The lackluster character development is the true failing of “The Aftermath.” Rachael, the center of the movie, was the most disappointing of all. Despite Knightley’s attempts at conveying Rachael’s volatile emotions, Rachael doesn’t effectively invoke sympathy in the viewer. Rachael’s character was not only predictable and shallow, but also stale and uninspiring, which her affair with Lubert exemplifies. The audience can tell right when the tall and handsome Lubert glances at Rachael from his window that they are bound to have an affair. But from the smoldering stares to the long, silent pauses, just about every interaction they have feels scripted. What little chemistry the actors have is lost in the awfully stilted script, and nothing points to this fact better than their first kiss, when Lubert forcefully kisses Rachael as they argue about a painting he put up.
The awkward development of the affair was not the only badly scripted aspect of the story. Most of what the main characters do and say seems obvious. Lubert is the good German, who of course was never part of the Nazi Party and who falls in love with Rachael. Lewis is the kind, morally righteous, sympathetic British soldier, whose benevolence is underscored by the cruelty of his fellow officers; at one point, a commanding officer shoots a teenager who breaks away from the line, and Lewis rushes to save the dying German. Rachael, of course, is the unhappy woman who initially dislikes Germans but grows to empathize with them. The actors, particularly Clarke and Knightley, try their best to express the right emotion at the right time, but rather than driving the plot forward with their interactions and relationship, their overblown affectations make them the victims of the plot, performing each action and sentiment to keep the story moving.
The most interesting aspect of the film is the time period in which the story takes place. It is set in the ruins of Hamburg, Germany after the war, with a focus on German resentment towards the British and cruelty during the British occupation. The strained relationship between the Germans and the British, humiliation, and gratitude were some themes that emerge in some of the more serious parts of the movie. However, Kent ends up dabbling in every aspect of postwar Germany possible and subsequently shoves these potentially-enriching subjects to the side as soon as they serve the purpose of either showing how morally upright one character is or serving as plot devices to advance the love triangle. Kent tries to do too much and accomplishes little as a result.
What starts off as a potentially insightful film about love in a postwar world turns into a glorified soap opera that sings a familiar tune. There is nothing new to “The Aftermath”; even the specificity of the time period couldn’t make up for the film’s routine love story and Knightley and Skarsgård's lack of chemistry. Kent complicates the supposedly happy ending in what is perhaps the most obvious manifestation of the film’s flaws, leaving nothing but a bad yet forgettable aftertaste.

As April showers approach, Netflix will gift its subscribers with a plethora of newly available films. Here are some films to look out for on Netflix this April, and some films to catch before they leave the platform.
Top Three Picks:
"The Hateful Eight": Extended Version (April 25)
The trailer for Quentin Tarantino's ninth (and possibly penultimate) film "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" dropped this week, and serves as a timely reminder to cherish the storied director's previous films. While "The Hateful Eight" may not be the best constructed piece in Tarantino's iconic filmography, it still features the snappy dialogue, twists, and trademark cathartic violence that have cemented the director's legacy. The film is Tarantino's unapologetically graphic take on a Western. For the majority of its runtime, the plot unfolds in one location — Minnie's Haberdashery — as bounty hunters John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) use it as a stop when transporting criminal Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) on their way to claiming a bounty for her capture. However, they realize that they are not alone in their mercenary ambitions. The film explores the mad twists as the titular "Hateful Eight" fight for control over Daisy. The theatrical cut is currently available on Netflix, but the extended version is sure to bring a new array of unapologetically graphic scenes which will please both faithful Tarantino devotees and newcomers alike.
"All The President's Men" (April 1)
Alan J. Pakula's 1976 film is a gripping tale of widespread deception, abuse of power, and the men who strove to uncover it. "All the President's Men" is as politically pertinent today as it was when Pakula made it more than 40 years ago in 1976. The film details the story of how two journalists, Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) and Bob Woodward (Robert Redford), uncovered the network of powerful politicians embroiled in the Watergate Scandal. Pakula is dogmatic in his portrayal of journalism as a vessel for truth, a notion that is strengthened by the strong performances of his two leads, Redford and Hoffman. The pacing may feel slow at times, but for every new track uncovered, every new clue unearthed, "All the President's Men" steals your attention. Once you’ve embarked, it's hard to let go.
"The Imitation Game" (April 29)
Director Morten Tyldum's 2014 biopic of English mathematician Alan Turing may sometimes seem as if it plays into conventional, "inspirational" movie tropes. While "The Imitation Game" isn't as cinematically groundbreaking as its subject matter, it is nevertheless a well-crafted, well-acted, and brilliantly scored piece of cinema. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Turing is powerful in its subtlety and complexity; he moves the audience emotionally when his character faces difficulties, is convincingly assertive when work needs to be done, and otherwise brings a quirky, interesting personality to life. Alexandre Desplat, who also scored "The Shape of Water" and "The Grand Budapest Hotel," accompanies the drama with soaring orchestral themes that help sell the emotional bedrock of the film.
Catch it before it goes!
"Casino Royale" (Leaving Netflix on April 1)
"Casino Royale" is not only an easy high point in the Daniel Craig era, but is also arguably one of the best James Bond films ever made. The iconic British spy is the centerpiece of the second longest running movie franchise (57 years, second only to "Godzilla" at 65 years), with 25 films and 6 different actors playing the lead role. While "Casino Royale" is one of the latest films in this series of adventures, it serves as a prequel, sketching out the foundations of Bond's cynical and brutish personality (of Daniel Craig's James Bond). Director Martin Campbell fleshed out the film with a host of strong, multidimensional characters that is headlined by HM Treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), and featured riveting riveting twists and a climactic card game that drips with eerie tension.
"L.A. Confidential" (Leaving Netflix on April 1)
Curtis Hanson's crime film features rapidfire storytelling of a rivalry between policemen Bud White (Russell Crowe), the living embodiment on brawn and brutish force, and Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), a laid-back intellectual who finds himself rising swiftly through the ranks of the police. The conflict between these two policemen and the central politics within the police station drives most of the film, but is also accompanied with thrilling crime set-pieces. With unexpected twists, charismatic leads who sell two starkly opposite characters, and a somewhat fantastical view of crime in Los Angeles in the 1950s, "L.A. Confidential" is enough of a journey in itself.

Craving for a fix of angsty, superficially deep Tumblr-Twitter-Instagram-esque poetry? Check out Amanda Lovelace’s work. “the mermaid’s voice returns in this one” is the third poetry collection in Lovelace’s “Women Are Some Kind of Magic” series, following “the princess saves herself in this one” and “the witch doesn’t burn in this one,” all of which attempt to spin classic fairytale imagery and tropes into modern messages of female empowerment. Lovelace’s project of portraying women as resilient and powerful is a noble one and her personal experiences with various internal and external struggles that inspired her writing should not be criticized themselves. But “the mermaid’s voice returns in this one” is a lackluster body of poetic work. In truth, “the mermaid’s voice returns in this one” sets lofty ambitions for tackling complex subject matters, but ultimately fails to achieve them with brief, choppy poems that disguise their lack of substance behind quirky line breaks and language so prettily vague that it parades as true depth.
Lovelace breaks up her collection into four distinct parts — I. the sky, II. the shipwreck, III. the song, and IV. the surviving — that sketch out a loose trajectory for her narrator’s tale of healing and learning self-love after exiting a destructive, abusive relationship. The collection opens with a foreword by novelist and poet Lang Leav, and features a few works from guest poets such as Nikita Gill and K.Y. Robinson that fit with the overarching motifs of oceans and princesses.
Lovelace’s style is exceedingly popular among amateur poets across social media platforms: free verse, short lines, no capitalization, simplistic word choice. As this way of writing blatantly seeks to provocatively subvert both poetic tradition and the rules of grammar, it paints Lovelace’s work as trying too hard to seem original. This makes it even more obvious when her poems fall short of ingenuity, such as when she writes plainly, “i don’t write / what i write / to hurt you.” Further, if normal capitalization were restored and the line breaks were taken away from a poem like “at / this point, / staying / with you / is nothing / more / than / muscle / memory,” readers would realize that Lovelace’s collection is essentially broken-up prose, generic statements that could have been snatched from any novel or blog post. The aesthetic format merely creates a cloak of false meaningfulness around words that would be too simplistic and literal to stand on their own.
Upon further analysis of the actual content of Lovelace’s poetry, there isn’t much to be found. She frequently throws out barrages of images and snippets of scenes — “a smile. / irresistible lashes. / a dark room. / legs tangled. / peace” — through this she raises tensions without fully resolving them, signaling a lack of clear direction in her writing and making her poetry frustratingly unsatisfying. Considering how brief Lovelace’s poems are, with many weighing in at under 30 words, relying on fleeting images to carry the writing without giving sufficient context or explanation is lazy. Still, although her poetic techniques are lacking, Lovelace has the chops to be a writer of fortune-cookie fortunes — she skillfully presents vagueness such that it can be misconstrued as a universally relatable truth of life.
Moreover, on the rare occasions where Lovelace actually makes an argument for her opinions and beliefs rather than tossing out images for her readers to dissect, she merely rehashes popular public sentiment concerning a given social issue without adding anything new to the literature about the topic. For example, in her poem “hooks encrusted in sand,” Lovelace takes a stance against gun violence at schools, painting an imagined utopia where “children / learn peacefully, / unafraid of / angry hands / around guns.” She portrays an oversimplified solution that doesn’t attempt to tackle the full complexity of the debate surrounding gun use, and essentially says, “But think of the children!”— hardly a point that hasn’t been made before across news sites and even phrased more poetically. It seems that Lovelace rides the high of people’s existing emotions regarding topical subjects in order to build a façade of social import while avoiding actually voicing a unique opinion in her writing.
Lovelace’s poems are pleasant enough in sound and easy to comprehend, but after reading the collection, none of the words or images stick in the mind. Like cotton candy, the collection is quick and easy to swallow, especially for those who are intimidated by more traditional poetry, but provides no true sustenance for thought and quickly dissipates. Even if vague, “fake deep” poetry sounds appealing to you, skip on “the mermaid’s voice returns in this one.” Tumblr’s #poetry tag is teeming with similar fare, and get this: It’s free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many, Grimm’s “Hansel and Gretel” is a cautionary tale of greed and a reminder of the danger that comes from trusting strangers and even those closest to us. The story is often remembered for the tantalizing gingerbread house at its center. What functions as a perilous trap in this fairy tale is a source of comfort and a powerful healing tool in Helen Oyeyemi’s new novel “Gingerbread,” a work inspired by the classical children’s tale. The novel carefully traces the lives of three generations of women in the Lee family — 17-year-old daughter Perdita, mother Harriet, and grandmother Margot. Altogether “Gingerbread” is a poignant story of ambition, displacement, and finding one’s way. “Gingerbread” is a story anchored by the strong bonds between its mothers and daughters.
To understand “Gingerbread,” it is important to embrace its ambiguous location. Part of what makes the novel so original is that its setting is unrecognizable. The Lee family comes from the small country Druhástrana, a faraway land that is — according to most people — made up. Both Margot and Harriet grew up here, before escaping to England in Harriet’s teenage years. Perdita feels a forceful desire to connect with her motherland after growing up in present day London. Perdita’s decision to travel to Druhástrana is the catalyst for the major events of the story.
Though a caring and loving mother, Harriet has always maintained her silence about her past and has kept the reasons for returning to their homeland a secret from Perdita. When Perdita realizes that the key to unlocking her own family history is Gretel, a mysterious, old friend of her mother’s, she takes desperate measures to find her, almost at the expense of her own life. This prompts Harriet to relate the events of her and Margot’s life, a narration that spans the majority of the novel.
When the story is placed in contemporary London, there is an acute sense of time and place as Margot is found agonizing over accidentally “superliking” someone on Tinder. But the moment the narration steps foot into Druhástrana, the reader loses all sense of time. With its threshing forks and incestuous marriages between its four farming families, the Druhástrana farmland of Harriet’s youth feels like a village out of the 18th century: “Whether you crossed it on foot or by tractor, wheat was all you saw ahead of you and all you saw behind.” It is a land that was once occupied by giants, but now has expanded to include a modern city.
When Harriet moves to this city to begin a job at a gingerbread making factory, the change in setting is incredibly jarring. With its factorial, cars, and gated-communities, the city feels modern and industrial, which undercuts the pictures painted of the isolated, serf-filled countryside: “Druhástranian gates reward close inspection. Their designs are usually so intricate that they serve as sparkling microcosms of what you’d see if you went in.” Though Oyeyemi’s clear and detailed descriptions carefully envision both worlds, readers who prioritize logic will find the lack of categorization rather frustrating.
Replete with its fictitious land, talking dolls, and enchanted gingerbread, Oyeyemi’s work easily falls into the genre of magical realism. But its class commentary and questions about female agency mean that it is also political. By following Harriet’s move from farm girl to factory worker, the story illustrates the number of difficulties that come from manual labor. At the factory, Harriet and other farm girls become ambassadors for the gingerbread company and are often put on to display the company’s happy workers. It becomes clear that those who make visits to the factory are older businessmen who fetishize these young farm girls, but the practice is allowed to continue due to its success. Oyeyemi’s takedown of dehumanizing factory life is as satisfying as the situation is disturbing, but it shows that she is more than capable of tackling ethical issues in a book that appears to differ greatly from reality.
Of course, it is the narrator’s unique humor which makes the novel digestible. Though it is easy to lose the way in the myriad of settings and narratives within “Gingerbread,” the wry voice of our narrator always returns to secure the plot. Early on, the narrator is quick to note that Hungary is the only country that recognizes Druhástrana’s existence — a hilarious fact that illustrates the novel’s rather absurd sense of humor. The character’s names, like Perdita which means “lost” in Latin, further demonstrate the irony that is deeply and successfully at play throughout the story.
Although gingerbread appears to be an obvious motif, its importance is explored in nuanced ways throughout the novel. It comes from a recipe that all the Lee women pass down and one that always finds success amongst those who taste it. The gingerbreads function as a complicated symbol that morphs across the pages of the book, but for the most part it becomes a vehicle by which these women have their adventures: “It was a square meal and a good night’s sleep and a long, blood-splattered howl at the moon rolled into one.”
While its mixed time period and genre can leave its readers feeling unmoored, “Gingerbread” does an excellent job of worldbuilding and providing sharp social commentary. Its touching portrayal of understanding the meaning of “home” and its surprising answer makes it one of the most significant bildungsroman of this year.

Tan’s French tuck, Jonathan’s repeated “henny,” Antoni’s love for corgis, Bobby’s shock upon seeing a messy living room, and Karamo’s tendency to make people cry: Any avid viewer of “Queer Eye” has seen it all before, but not quite like this. The third season of “Queer Eye” opens with an emotional first episode, featuring Jody, a prison guard who hasn’t quite figured out how to accept her own beauty. From here, the emotional stakes only rise higher. Though it’s easy to sit back and wonder just how much of a difference the Fab Five can make in each person’s life — surely the causes of each person featured have much more to do with deeper issues than simply being messy or not knowing how to cook — this season proves that regardless of what causes each person’s struggles, these five men know how to dig deep and ask the right questions, all while entertaining a larger audience.
Some episodes pack more of an emotional punch than others. The story of sisters Shorty and Little, who struggle to keep things together after 35 years of hard work and early mornings at their barbecue restaurant, raises important questions about the disproportionate amount of emotional labor black women have to put into their jobs or careers. Watching Jess, a young woman in her 20s, tell the story of how her adoptive parents kicked her out from her home upon finding out that she was lesbian is also emotionally compelling. Listening to Rob, a man on the cusp of marriage, yet unable to see the good within himself, come to terms with the roots of his self-deprecation will bring tears to the eyes of many.
Each of the eight episodes reveals that “Queer Eye” is about more than simply buying a more flattering wardrobe and learning to make a signature dish. Halfway through any episode comes the realization that the underlying reason for any of the participants’ haphazard appearance or lax approach to cleaning their houses is not, in fact, because they are lazy, but because there are deeper issues at play.
The simple fact is that Jess, Rob, and Joey — a single father who buys clothes only when absolutely necessary, having convinced himself that needing anything more is a sign of vanity, not self-care — and the various other guests on the show all slowly reveal the sources of an inner trauma in ways that are both profoundly moving and poignant. That guests dealing with serious life problems can only find help via a reality TV show designed for the entertainment of thousands of Netflix viewers is a sad commentary on the state of mental health in the United States.
This question is one the viewer will often grapple with: Are the changes the Fab Five instill in each of eight episodes enough to help those who appear in the series, or are the changes merely cosmetic? This season of “Queer Eye” shows that the series has evolved far beyond the first season’s insistence on developing confidence and self-love and instead has amplified these values, recontextualizing them in a more serious way amid the inner struggles and trauma with which both viewers and participants grapple. The Fab Five unearth how one’s outward appearance and surroundings are directly affected by the deeper parts of one’s psyche. This is good television: It feels good to watch, but it also allows the viewer to connect to it on a deeper emotional level.
One of the subtler ways to track the positive impact the Fab Five have on the subject of each episode is by looking at their faces. As each person’s confidence rises, so too falls away a thick beard, tangled hair, or a stray hand covering a smile. By the end, the audience sees more of the person’s face. Though their traumatic pasts cannot be fixed, the five men collectively help their subjects see the good within them — corny, yes, but so begins change in the right direction.
“Queer Eye” is not all heavy emotional material. This season introduces Bruley, the dog who steals food when he shouldn’t, as well as small helpful life tidbits at the end of each episode. (Don’t fast forward to the next episode without watching Antoni and Tan fight over the right pronunciation of the word “tomato.”) Tune in to episode seven to find out which member of the Fab Five has a panther as his spirit animal. Spoiler: Antoni firmly identifies as “an adolescent corgi, a tri-color.” The blend of these light-hearted moments perfectly offsets the more emotional ones, at which points the audience realizes that while the Fab Five have done all they could to help, there is, of course more work to be done on behalf of each participant.
Perhaps that’s really what the series is all about, and why “Queer Eye” is so successful at what it does. It’s not about fixing the deeper causes, but rather about unearthing them for each individual to see, for themselves, who they are and where they need to go.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Travis Karter is not your typical up-and-coming rapper. His goals, musical and otherwise, are loftier and wider in scope than one might expect from a college-aged artist. On his latest album, “WHITE PANTHER," Karter (born Kristofer Madu), a student at Johns Hopkins University, takes inspiration from his academic interests, personal history, and philanthropic pursuits. His music clearly serves a purpose beyond art itself. It can be difficult to separate art from artist, especially when the artist himself seems to want those lines blurred, but in this case, the artist himself stands out as far more interesting and complex than the album he created.
The first voice we hear on the album’s opener, “TIRED,” is that of a robotic-sounding woman informing the listener that “100 percent of the proceeds from this album go toward providing clean water for children around the world.” To those who do not know the artist’s backstory, this intro sequence may sound like a gimmick. But Karter does significant work on behalf of Water Is the Answer, a nonprofit organization he created in 2015 in order to improve access to clean water for communities in Nigeria. It is not by accident that Karter puts this information at the very beginning of his album; his international philanthropy defines him as an artist as much as any stylistic feature of his music.
Karter is at his most successful when he casts aside the trends that have defined much of the SoundCloud rap music created in recent years by his peers. Whereas popular rap songs have trended toward shorter lengths in the recent past, Karter isn’t afraid to let his songs play out for as long as is necessary; on “COLD,” he delivers some of the strongest (and longest) verses on the album as he addresses a spiteful former love interest. Karter raps, “I swear to God, nothing makes you strong like a fucking heartbreak,” and the triumphant nature of this particular break-up song makes it hard to doubt him.
The album’s highlight comes in the form of its seventh track, “BLACK PANTHER,” a nod to the globally popular movie of the same name. It’s easy to imagine that Karter can identify, on some level, with the superhero; the elements of heroism in the young artist’s pursuits are undeniable. The song is a heavy-hitting trap anthem with a thunderous beat and raucous, reverb-heavy vocals. Yet even here Karter makes sure to remind listeners that he has aims higher than simply making good music. Later in the song, he raps, “Came in this world to do somethin’, all these boys ain’t do nothin’,” expressing in no uncertain terms his compulsion to make a difference, whether in music or otherwise.
When Karter’s songs fall short, it is often because they slip into cliché. “ROCKSTAR” is an homage to the lifestyle of the rich and famous that feels out of touch with not only the rest of the album, but also Karter’s carefully curated image as an artist. “FLASHIN’” is his effort at a socially conscious track, offering commentary on racial profiling and police brutality. The song’s chorus is frustratingly repetitive and incorporates pitched-up vocals that undermine the weight of the lyrical content. The track concludes with a skit staging an encounter between a bigoted police officer and a black man, followed by an extended sample of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. This sample feels out of place in the context of the song and the album as a whole: poignant, but not quite in line with the overall tone and themes at work.
Karter’s energy and ambition shine through on most of the album’s tracks, and when this energy wavers, it is more a product of age and inexperience than a lack of talent or skill. On “WHITE PANTHER OUTRO,” the chorus asks over and over again, “What do you want to do with your life?” Karter leaves listeners with the very question that motivates his music, his philanthropy, and all of his other endeavors. His rap career is just one part of his search for purpose. He seems to almost see it as more of an ongoing question than a final answer. In any case, the album’s conclusion is especially fitting. It leaves us with the image of a young man with tremendous potential, both in music and elsewhere, asking himself on how he ought to use it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zoe: Don’t forget where you come from. A string of seemingly innocent words, this sentence has haunted me for most of my life. The phrase that I carried with me through the hallways of my joint elementary and middle school on the affluent side of Houston. I received the best education I could and became one of a handful of the school’s Latinx students until I left for high school.
Ten years later, my Harvard enrollment signified endless educational opportunity in exchange for being a minority at a predominantly white institution. Doors opened for my first-generation, low-income Latina hands. Doors that had always been closed to those before me. With that opportunity came the transformation of “don’t forget where you come from” to “don’t sell out.”
Ruben: The conversation is almost mechanical: If you are among the half of the surveyed graduating class that enter the fields of finance (18 percent), consulting (18 percent), or technology (14 percent), you’re a sell out. This is especially true if you belong to a demographic systemically hurt by these industries, especially low-income communities of color.
If you’re a person of color working in these fields, you contribute to gentrification, the displacement of poor people, and systems built off the backs of people from backgrounds similar to yours. You contribute to the oppression of the community you come from. There’s no way of parsing this reality any other way.
But, simultaneously, a job in these fields brings a substantial salary. In addition to ensuring rent and food security, you’re able to provide for family members who are struggling. “Selling out” is not always just about you and your personal gain — it’s about helping a sick relative or ensuring family members are able to make rent.
Z: Soon enough I wasn’t just me. I was my community. My decisions held weight, because I was one of few Latinx students in an elite space. To work in the private sector was equated with spitting on the hands that had lifted me here, shirking my responsibility as the future of my community. Forgetting where I had come from in favor of a high-paying salary meant being a sellout, a traitor. The only way to avoid those labels was by working in the public sector, considered the only way any Latinx person could fight oppression.
R: More than 50 percent of surveyed graduating seniors entering the workforce report starting salaries greater than $70,000, with 11 percent reporting salaries upwards of $110,000. This means that many low-income students will make more money in their first year of work than their families do in a year. For students who come from annual household incomes below $20,000, entering tech, finance, or consulting could double or triple their family’s income. Can we, in good conscience, criticize their career choice?
Z: What did it mean to be a sellout? I could see the privilege that had brought me to this point. How my single-mother made money stretch, so I could spend high school studying instead of working. I recognized how my primary education had groomed me for an elite university, even then. These privileges, among others, were the pillars to my spot at the Ivy League. I knew most in my community didn’t get that shot.
At home, getting a well-paying job is what it meant to be successful. It was the purpose of my education. At school, getting a well-paying private sector job is what it meant to “forget” where I come from. It was the antithesis of being a Latinx student at an elite university.
R: The question of selling out or not, especially among students of color, isn’t clean cut. You do contribute to the oppression of others within career fields that, in their very design, siphon other people of color out, and hurt a wide swath of already marginalized people. But unlike a white classmate who comes from a background of mind-boggling wealth and family connections, entering morally-questionable fields is often a necessity. It allows an individual to directly contribute to the livelihoods — the very survival — of the people they love, the people who’ve nursed them and made their very journey to Harvard possible.
Z: As a student of color, I am intimately aware of the oppressive societal systems that exist everywhere. I understand the past of my community, I know its precarious future. As one of the few who made it out, I am meant to fight for the rest, to push for their success. Yet too often that narrative is one that is tied to certain sectors, certain jobs, and certain positions. The public sector is not, and can not, be the only place where Latinxs fight for our community. The constant villainization of the private sector and the Latinx students who choose to be employed by it neglects that those predominantly white spaces must also diversify. We are meant to open doors for others, not shut them.
R: “Selling out” does not look the same for everyone. Folks who enter exploitative industries must acknowledge the way their choices and jobs hurt other people of color. We must critique these phenomena. But as we do, we should also avoid demonizing folks who have good reason to enter these fields, especially when their reasons feel existential. Doing so shifts our focus from los vendidos, to the system that threatens to crush us all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shopping week continues to be one of the most hotly contested issues on campus. Ever at the forefront of this controversy, the Faculty Council — the Faculty of Arts and Science’s highest governing body — will vote Wednesday on whether to endorse a proposal set to significantly impact the status of shopping week and student life more broadly for years to come.
This proposal, which was presented by the chairs of a faculty committee investigating course registration — Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh and Philosophy professor Bernhard Nickel — suggests two primary measures: first, to postpone a final decision on the status of shopping week until spring 2022; and second, to form a new committee to more deeply investigate trends in enrollment, as a function of a broad range of University issues.
As the Council prepares to vote on this proposal, we believe it should recognize that shopping week is an issue that first and foremost affects undergraduate students and graduate student workers. Given the pressing and deeply relevant issues that currently face both groups, we believe that postponing any decision on shopping week is imperative.
Until graduate students have fully established their institutional standing as a newly formed union, they will not be able to adequately express their collective opinion on shopping week. With its ambitious list of 80 bargaining goals, the union expects that reaching a holistic agreement with the University will be an uphill battle. The first months of the bargaining process have been marked by disagreement and deadlock, resulting in only four agreements as of January.
The Council should be hyperconscious of this process when it votes on Wednesday, as frankly, graduate students are perhaps the most affected by shopping week. Every semester, shopping week forces graduate students to face significant job uncertainty, unsure of what or even if they will have the opportunity to teach and receive a much-needed stipend. The proposal smartly identifies graduate student unionization as an important factor for the new committee to consider as they investigate enrollment trends. But unionization is not merely a factor to be investigated by the committee. The perspective of that union — as the collective voice of the very group most affected by shopping week – must be taken into account. Until the unionization process is complete, these graduate student workers will not have the ability to adequately or completely represent opinions and interests that are vital in ensuring that the proposed system works for everyone.
Moreover, as we have skeptically noted, the administration has inundated the undergraduate body with requests for feedback on student life in the form of seemingly innumerable surveys. Not only do these surveys speak to a high demand being placed on undergraduates at the moment, but it suggests that there are a number of arguably more important issues at the forefront of undergraduates’ minds right now, not least among them sexual misconduct and safety and inclusion in campus spaces.
Given that a productive investigation into enrollment trends will necessarily include undergraduate contributions, the Council should be aware of these demands and preoccupations that have been both circumstantially and administratively placed on undergraduate shoulders.
Extending the timeline for a shopping week decision would likely result in the opportunity to gather more accurate and representative data about undergraduate interests and enrollment, as well as to potentially utilize the results of ongoing investigations into student life and campus climate.
We have so often been critical of the University and its various governing bodies for seeming to drag their feet on issues of enormous importance to student life. On this issue, however, we hope the Faculty Council votes to slow down, acknowledging the fact that undergraduate students and graduate student workers are not in position at this moment to adequately contribute to what could very well be a historic pedagogical decision.

I want to be convinced of the sanctions. I have ever since I came into Harvard, mixed on the issue. Like the sanctions’ opponents, I had concerns that they were mixing together all types of single-gender organizations and infringing on students’ rights. But I supported what I presumed to be the sanctions’ main goals: lessening the power of these clubs and rectifying the social scene on campus.
So I have imagined this topic as a debate, like one that students might have in a classroom or an Institute of Politics forum — except that Harvard is one of the parties that must persuade. But for a long time, this has been far from reality, since Harvard is not obligated to convince its students to support the sanctions. And fair enough — as University President Lawrence S. Bacow said, anyone who chooses to attend Harvard chooses to live under its rules. But regardless of what Harvard has to do, I still think it should try to defend itself. That’s what the school would ask of its students.
I hope the pending sanctions lawsuit will force Harvard to actually make arguments and be persuasive. Because so far, the rhetoric of the administration surrounding the sanctions rollout has been insufficient and even insulting.
Most bafflingly, the administration seems perfectly willing to contradict itself and make easily disprovable allegations. Its first motivation for the sanctions was to address sexual assault. Though surely nobody would profess to be against preventing sexual assault, many were, rightfully, against using sanctions to do so. Even though the administration moved away from this rationale, instead of acknowledging the shift, it ended up sidestepping as if sexual assault prevention had never been the main rationale at all — an easily challenged stance that, in hindsight, already hinted at the disingenuousness to come.
The administration also ignores developments that raise questions about whether the sanctions are working. Its newer rationales for the sanctions are that they will tackle gender discrimination, as the first step in tackling all forms of discrimination. There are fair points here: The final clubs are notoriously exclusive, and former University President Drew G. Faust has been especially passionate about improving women’s feeling of belonging at college.
So there should have been some serious reflection as the final clubs responded, for the most part, along two tracks. While the male clubs dug in their heels and vowed to resist, the female clubs opened up. As of December, there is only one all-female social organization at Harvard; for the previous four months, there had been zero.
Is this discrepancy a problem? If the goal of the sanctions is to eradicate gender discrimination, probably not. But if the goal is to help women feel more included in Harvard’s social scene, then maybe it is. The point is, there’s a debate here that the administration isn’t grappling with. Bacow acknowledged that organization members are “responding in their own way” — but his statement euphemistically glosses over the issue that there seem to be two distinct ways, separated by gender.
The extent to which the administration relies on canned answers that could have been given two years ago, instead of responding to new developments, is captured perfectly in this correction. In December, The Crimson clarified that in an interview that month with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, Khurana did not “not answer” questions regarding the sanctions; he merely “repeatedly pointed to previous statements instead of directly answering questions.”
One of Khurana’s answers also embodies my third complaint: that the administration patronizes its students. To the question of how exactly the sanctions would be enforced — a basic question that still did not have an answer — Khurana replied: “I trust our students,” and “I would ask each student to think about… being the best version of themselves.”
As heartwarming as it is, this laughably vague statement contradicts the very nature of the sanctions. If the administration trusted its students, it would not need sanctions. Harvard cannot have it both ways.
To justify the sanctions, the administration must justify their premise — that Harvard believes its students do not deserve that trust. Khurana’s kind of non-answer suggests that the administration doesn’t just not care about its hypocrisy; it also has the gall to assume that we students won’t care or notice.
With these obfuscations and stalls, the sanctions rollout has disappointed and irked me. But I can’t imagine that this is the best Harvard can do; I think this rollout has been the product of the administration’s assuming it can unilaterally dictate a policy without addressing pushback. But I do still want to be persuaded. I hope the lawsuit will force Harvard to go on the defensive and do that real work of persuading.

After years of discussions about how to combat Cambridge’s enduring challenges with a lack of affordable housing, City Councillors plan to push for legislation enacting a “100%-Affordable Housing Zoning Overlay” plan in the coming weeks.
The proposed zoning reform will offer incentives to developers in return for building residential units that are considered “100%-Affordable,” according to the City Council website. These reforms are intended to bolster the ability of affordable housing developers to compete against market-rate developers. The proposal will also amend current zoning regulations to streamline approval processes, reducing costs and increasing construction efficiency for new affordable housing.
The plan intends to use public funds to help developers "more quickly, more cost effectively, and in areas where there are fewer affordable housing options for residents,” according to the website. The proposal stemmed from concerns about displacement and increasing rents.
Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern wrote in an emailed statement that high property and living costs in Cambridge made the affordable housing overlay “necessary.”
“We need to provide this relief so that more affordable housing can be built to address our affordable housing crisis,” he wrote.
At last Wednesday’s Housing Committee meeting, officers dedicated more than two hours to public comment regarding the proposed overlay, with both dedicated supporters and critics airing their views before the council.
Critics of the plan said the overlay could impose residential projects into unsuited neighborhoods, worsen traffic congestion, and work against the middle class. Supporters, however, argued that the overlay could help ensure access and equity.
City Councillor E. Denise Simmons, chair of the Housing Committee, said during the meeting that public input would be important in shaping the legislation.
“As I’ve said in previous hearings, it is critical that we all reach a shared understanding of what this proposed overlay is, what it aims to achieve, and how it would work,” Simmons said.
Recently released results from Cambridge’s 2018 Resident Opinion Survey indicate that 35 percent of respondents believe affordable housing is “the single most important issue facing the City of Cambridge today.”
According to McGovern, the overlay proposal will next proceed to a third Housing Committee meeting on March 28 and a roundtable discussion on April 9. Then, the proposal will head to the Ordinance Committee for a series of hearings, before arriving before the City Council.

Lowell House will not display portraits of former University President Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877, and his wife Anna Parker Lowell when it reopens in the fall, incoming Faculty Deans David I. Laibson ’88 and Nina Zipser announced in a Friday email to House residents.
Lowell’s tenure as University President — which stretched from 1909 to 1933 — was marked both by the major changes he instituted at Harvard and by his racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, and xenophobia. Laibson and Zipser said students should not have to see images of the two Lowells — after whose family the House is named — in such a prominent space.
During his tenure, Lowell created the house system and worked to integrate students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. He also sought to cap the number of Jewish students at Harvard and excluded African-American students from living in Harvard Yard. Alongside former Dean of the College Chester N. Greenough, Class of 1898, he led a purge of gay students — the “Secret Court” of 1920 — connected to at least one suicide.
The portraits of Lowell and his wife hung in the Lowell dining hall before renovations began.
Laibson and Zipser wrote that they did not want to erase part of Harvard’s history and that they plan to host discussions on the Lowell family’s legacy. They also wrote they will invite students to view another portrait of Lowell in University Hall.
“Such an erasure is not possible and, in our view, is not desirable,” Laibson and Zipser wrote. “We should not ignore or hide our history. We need to keep talking about Abbott Lawrence Lowell with each new cohort of Lowell residents (discussing both the good and the bad that he contributed) whether or not he is hanging over us while we’re eating Cheerios.”
Laibson and Zipser also announced they would add several paintings by University portraitist and Lowell Senior Common Room member Stephen E. Coit ’71 to the renovated dining hall, including a portrait of outgoing Faculty Deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin. A portrait of former Radcliffe College administrator and Lowell Senior Common Room member Florence C. Ladd will also be added.
Laibson and Zipser added that they would reinstall portraits of some other members of the Lowell family in the renovated dining hall.
Lowell resident Richard Yarrow ’19 said he supports the decision to not display the portrait in a prominent place, but said he believes the house should not erase all signs of his tenure.
“The portrait of A. Lawrence Lowell doesn’t need to be peering down at students in the middle of lunchtime or breakfast,” he said. “I’m a Jewish student. A. Lawrence Lowell was a notorious anti-Semite. He kept out my grandfather. There are lots of reasons why we shouldn’t be honoring him. That said, he’s also a part of our history. And I think there are significant problems with forgetting aspects of our history that are less comfortable for us to think about.”
Yarrow added that he thinks displaying portraits or busts of Lowell in less central house locations, along with plaques explaining his legacy, would remind students of Harvard’s history of exclusion and the need for the University to serve underrepresented groups.
History department fellow Benjamin J. Sacks, who has written about Lowell’s tenure at Harvard, said the University should do more to publically grapple with his racist views.
“Lowell sought to promote a very particular type of person and to exclude a lot of other constituencies,” he said. “The University needs to be public in acknowledging Lowell’s very problematic legacy and perhaps take a more proactive and public examination of his past.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Sacks’s remarks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
College students will not be allowed to bring guests to this year’s Yardfest — a spring music festival held annually in Harvard Yard — according to an email sent to undergraduates Monday by the Dean of Students Office.
The email also announced other changes to Yardfest that administrators said stemmed in part from the recommendations issued by a committee appointed by former University President Drew G. Faust following the arrest of a black Harvard undergraduate the night of last year's Yardfest. The incident drew allegations of police brutality and led some students to call on the University to improve its policies for the event.
“Although they reflect the recommendations of the Review Committee following the 2018 Yardfest, the changes we are announcing today are also established best-practices for large-scale events on college campuses,” the email reads.
Monday’s announcement informed students that the concert will take place on Sunday, April 7 at 3:30 p.m — a shift from the previous two years, when it occurred on a Friday evening. The shift back to a Sunday afternoon comes after more than 17 students were transported by ambulance as a result of their intoxication last year, overwhelming the emergency rooms at several local hospitals.
The committee reported noted that first responder resources are "predictably pressured" on Friday and Saturday nights, prompting it to recommend that the College schedule Yardfest at another time.
Administrators wrote in the email that dinner and water will be available in the Yard, and urged students to have enough to eat and drink over the course of the event. Per the committee’s recommendations, administrators also wrote that the College will not allow students to re-enter the concert venue.
College spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman wrote in an email that the DSO decided to eliminate guest tickets in order to make the event safer.
“The policy regarding guest tickets is being implemented in an effort to maintain a manageable capacity for this event and help ensure a safe and fun environment for all students,” Goldman wrote.
The review committee’s other recommendations include adopting a no-bags policy, increasing the number of Harvard University Police Department officers at the event, and monitoring safety through a centralized Emergency Operations Center. HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano did not respond to a request for comment Monday evening about security measures for the event.
Goldman wrote the College will review the effectiveness of its new Yardfest policies after the concert.
“Following Yardfest we will be evaluating all aspects of the event to help in our planning for future years,” he wrote.
Yardfest traditionally features a prominent musical headliner invited by the College Events Board, which organizes the event; rappers Lil’ Yachty and Wale headlined last year’s show. The 2019 guest artist will be announced on Wednesday evening at the Battle for Yardfest concert, scheduled for 7 p.m. in Sanders Theatre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
In his second international trip, University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended academic freedom and outlined his vision for Harvard’s future in China, Hong Kong, and Japan in several high-profile meetings with Harvard alumni, university leaders, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Bacow’s week-long excursion to Asia culminated Wednesday in a highly publicized speech at Peking University, where he addressed the role of universities and their pursuit of “truth, excellence, and opportunity” in the world and praised the long-standing ties between Peking and Harvard.
“Our institutions have a responsibility to contribute positively to our own societies and to the national good, as well as to the world at large,” Bacow said. “But as universities we fulfill this charge precisely by embodying and defending academic values that transcend the boundaries of any one country.”
The speech, however, was not without controversy. Bacow offered support for the May Fourth movement, an early 20th century youth campaign against the Chinese government, and concluded his remarks with a poem from Abdurehim Ötkür, a member of the country’s Uighur population. International rights groups claim that the Uighers, a Muslim minority group living in Western China, have faced detention and surveillance at the hands of the Chinese government — allegations that the government denies.
Peking University and Chinese state media did not mention those comments in articles about the event. University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment about their exclusion from official reports.
The Peking University speech came at a tense point for United States-China relations. The two nations have imposed billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other in recent months and have struggled to bring an end to the trade war, which has impacted financial markets, triggered political tensions, and created problems for companies around the world.
Bacow alluded to these tensions in his speech, calling on scholars around the world to band together and maintain good relations with one another.
“As I speak to you now, our governments are engaged in important and at times difficult discussions over a range of issues — and those discussions have implications that reverberate around the world,” Bacow said. “I believe that sustaining the bonds that join scholars across borders is of the utmost importance for all of us gathered here today — and for anyone who cares about the unique role that higher education plays in the lives of countless people.”
Bacow also met with Xi on Wednesday, and the two discussed educational exchanges between the United States and China, according to Chinese press coverage of the event.
"We will expand the opening up of education, strengthen exchanges and experiences sharing with countries around the world, and jointly promote the development of education," Xi said in an article published by the Xinhua News Agency, the official state-run press agency.
A spokesperson for the Chinese government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Eric P. Cheung, a Harvard Business School graduate who attended an alumni event in Hong Kong, wrote in an email that the speech at the Hong Kong event was “excellent.”
“It reminded our [C]hinese students that transformational thoughts and actions often take root on university [campuses] where intellectual freedom is paramount,” Cheung wrote.
In an interview prior to his departure, Bacow stressed the importance of international trips and bolstering Harvard’s presence in the world.
“While we are a distinctly American institution, we have a global footprint,” Bacow said. “So, it's important, I think, as president that I engage with people throughout the world and I will continue to do that.”
Karen L. Thornber, the director of the Harvard Asia Center, lauded Bacow’s decision to travel to Asia, calling it an “incredibly important” step to strengthening foreign relations.
“It sends a strong message that Harvard is committed to forging strong ties or continuing strong ties with Asia, but also acknowledging the importance of Asia on the world stage and the importance of remaining very strongly engaged with everything that's happening in Asia,” Thornber said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
​​​​​​
University President Lawrence S. Bacow reaffirmed in a letter to a group of Government graduate students that Harvard would not commence an external review of sexual misconduct allegations against Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez until its internal review concludes.
Bacow’s email came in response to a letter from the Government Department Graduate Student Association’s External Review Working Group, which has repeatedly called for an independent investigation of the allegations against Dominguez — levied by at least 20 women and spanning nearly 40 years. In their letter, students demanded a “public” commitment to an external review and a “feasible timeline” for the initiation of such a review.
In his email, Bacow acknowledged that University administrators “have expressed a willingness” to conduct an external review, but reiterated that he believes “how best to orient such an examination” cannot be decided until the University’s Title IX investigation into Dominguez — which has been ongoing for roughly a year — wraps up.
“While I appreciate your concern about the passage of time, our adjudicatory processes seek to be as thorough and fair as possible—and that commitment, which I’m sure you share, invariably means that sometimes it can time [sic] for the work to be completed,” Bacow wrote.
Multiple students said Monday that they found Bacow’s response to their concerns insufficient.
Government Ph.D. candidate Andrew M. Leber said the letter did not clearly indicate a “real plan” for addressing the concerns of graduate students.
“When you have to put this many qualifiers on the statement, it doesn't really convey much sense that the University is taking this seriously or really intends to produce much in the way of tangible results that go beyond the suggestion that we need another institution, or need to hire another lawyer, or need to take another survey,” he said.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on criticisms of the letter.
Allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced against Dominguez over a year ago, when the Chronicle of Higher Education published two articles revealing allegations of misconduct by Dominguez dating back nearly four decades.
University affiliates began calling for an external review of the allegations in March 2018, when 15 of Dominguez’s accusers demanded University administrators create an “independent commission” to conduct such a review. They argued the commission was vital to examining the institutional deficiencies that allowed Dominguez to maintain his position as a faculty member even after administrators first learned of harassment allegations in the early 1980s.
Multiple students also said they are grateful that Bacow responded to their outreach. External Review Working Group member and Government Ph.D. candidate Olivia A. Woldemikael wrote in an email that, though she believes the letter “wasn't an invitation for dialogue,” she is nonetheless “grateful” for Bacow’s response.
“We have been repeating our request for an external review since shortly after the reports of Dominguez’s sexual harassment were published in March 2018,” Woldemikael wrote. “Up until this point, it felt like shouting into a void.”
In his letter, Bacow pointed to the University’s recent efforts to establish “a comprehensive infrastructure” designed to create a harassment-free campus, including an ongoing Title IX policy review committee created in 2015 and the formation of an action collaborative this year with other universities dedicated to studying sexual harassment.
A Government department committee tasked with scrutinizing departmental culture has also called for an external review.
Committee member Sarah S. Fellman ’18-’19 said that, in pointing out existing resources, Bacow’s email “dodges the main question.”
“I think the President mentioned a lot of laudable efforts that the University is working on, but those are efforts it should be working on anyway,” Fellman said. “We certainly absolutely should be improving Title IX policy and surveying folks, but that's not what we asked for, and that's not what we need in this circumstance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was the top of the eighth inning in a tied game, the third of a tied series, when junior outfielder Jake Suddleson stepped into the batter’s box. With the bases juiced, Suddleson was poised to drive in a run or two and finally break the stalemate. He drove in four.
“It was a 4-4 game and we were scrapping away,” said senior pitcher Ian Miller. “We needed that one hit to get us over the edge. Jake really came through for us and hit an opposite field grand slam. His energy going around the bases was infectious — it really picked us up. It was great.”
“Jake Suddleson’s grand slam was one of the more exciting baseball moments I’ve ever had in my life,” added senior first baseman Patrick McColl. “The whole dugout was going crazy.”
The grand slam marked Suddleson’s fifth home run of the season, and was emblematic of the Crimson’s (10-5, 2-1 Ivy) offensive attack in this weekend’s three high-scoring contests against the Quakers (11-6, 1-2). Suddleson hit two home runs and two doubles in the series, McColl hit two homers and three doubles, and senior infielder and team captain Chase Aldridge contributed a homer and a double as well.
“Going up to the plate, our whole team has a lot of confidence right now,” commented McColl, whose home run in the fourth inning of Sunday’s game tied the contest at four runs apiece. “We’re aggressive swinging the bat — we don’t walk a whole lot but we get a ton of hits. I think it’s very contagious. We knew that it was going to be an offensive day in a hitter-friendly park.”
McColl himself continued a hot start to the season. He extended a multi-hit streak to six straight games, and holds the highest batting average in the country at .515. He is also tied with Suddleson with 22 RBI’s on the season, leading the team, and was named Ivy League player of the week. Nonetheless, he was nonchalant about his recent success at the plate.
“You just do everything you can,” the Los Altos, Calif., native said. “Baseball’s a game where sometimes you get lucky, and sometimes you get unlucky. I’ve been feeling good at the plate, being aggressive, and getting good pitches to hit. It’s been working so far — hopefully I’ll be able to keep it up.”
On Saturday, the Crimson played a windy, high-scoring doubleheader against the Quakers, taking the first game 12-9 but dropping the second game 16-12.
“We did a really good job coming out with energy in the first game,” Miller said. “Everyone was super excited to play.”
“It was nice to get into the Ivy League season — this ups the ante a little bit and makes the games more intense,” McColl said. “Saturday was a crazy day — the wind was blowing super hard, which pushed up the scores and home runs in the two games. For the first game we were able to come out on top in a slugfest, but in the second game we came out a little flatter and Penn was able to take it.”
The focus of the weekend, though, was the Sunday matchup that decided the series.
“Sunday was a super fun baseball day,” McColl said. “It was a really intense game.”
Miller was able to control the Quaker offense from the bump. He pitched 7.1 innings and collected his second win of the young season.
“I was just trying to throw strikes and keep the ball down,” the Brooklyn, N.Y., native had to say. “I tried to use their aggression to my advantage. The ball was traveling like crazy this weekend, and they’d been doing a really good job elevating the ball into the wind. I was trying to keep the ball on the ground as much as possible.”
Miller also credited the Crimson infield with solid defensive play to back him up.
“My infield did a fantastic job turning two and making the plays behind me,” he offered, “so I was able to lean on them.”
All in all, the weekend provided the Harvard squad with an encouraging start to Ivy League play.
“Penn is a great team, so we knew that it was going to be a challenge,” Miller said. “But we also knew that if we came out and made a statement this weekend, we were going to be in a great position going forward. We feel really good about the rest of the Ivy League season having won on the road against a really good team.”
“We’re pretty confident going into this next series,” McColl added. “We’re going to try to win as many as we can, but we just focus on one game at a time.”
Harvard takes on Holy Cross in a non-conference contest on Tuesday before facing Princeton over the weekend. Both matchups will be at home on O’Donnell Field.

On Sunday night, the No. 13/14 Harvard men’s hockey team learned that it would face off against No. 4 Massachusetts in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The group gathered in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center’s Boynton Lounge to await its draw, eager to embark on the journey to the promised land.
Just two weeks earlier, another Crimson team came together in that very room, eyes similarly glued to the television screens. But they weren’t watching ESPNU’s Division-I selection show in anticipation of matchups to come; rather, they were reliving a past game — one they all shared three decades ago, memories of which scarcely required the visual reminders on the screens around them.
That night, a dozen members of Harvard’s 1989 National Championship team returned to their old stomping grounds for a nostalgic commemoration of the 30th anniversary of school’s first-ever NCAA crown.
“It was really great to see so many guys be able to make it,” said Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91, a member of the 1989 squad in his own right. “It is a testament to how close the group is. I was looking forward to the night and to seeing everybody…but I enjoyed it even more than I was hoping or expecting to.”
April Fools’ day, 1989, was no joke: it marked a momentous win for both the Crimson program and the school at large. Then-junior Ed Krayer ’89-90 played the hero, picking up a rebound generated by a point shot off a faceoff and putting it home in overtime. The goal defeated Minnesota, 4-3, and silenced the effective home crowd for the Golden Gophers at the St. Paul Civic Center — remembered for its transparent boards.
The Crimson was superb throughout the 1988-1989 campaign, going 15 games without a loss to open the schedule en route to a 31-3 overall record. The squad was as deep as a Harvard team has ever been, boasting numerous Olympians and NHL draftees. Chief among them was captain and eventual Hobey Baker Award winner Lane MacDonald ’88-89. Dynamic forwards Peter Ciavaglia ’91, C.J. Young ’90, sixth-year senior Allen Bourbeau ’88, and Donato helped round out the group’s attack, while role players like enforcer Kevan Melrose ’90 also contributed vitally to the championship puzzle.
“As a group, there’s nothing better than achieving a goal together, and having a chance to share it,” MacDonald said. “You sacrifice so much, you go through so much together, and then when you get there, you just get to share it with 25 of your best friends.”
Behind the bench: the program’s most decorated coach, Bill Cleary ’56. Cleary epitomized Harvard athletic excellence for six decades, first as a player, then a bench boss, then the Director of Athletics.
“At that point for Harvard, it was the first NCAA Championship,” MacDonald noted. “For Bill Cleary, for him to achieve that goal was fantastic. For the university to achieve that goal, and the message that it sent about being a student-athlete and the fact that you can do it at the next level, was great.”
In a way, the watch party provided an opportunity for the 1989 champions simply to marvel at the spectacular humans and hockey players on that roster.
“We didn’t need to win the game to be friends forever, but I think having that common bond over something as special as this, it gives us something to connect [around] for the rest of our lives,” said Chuck Hughes, a freshman net-minder during the 1989 season and current co-chair of the Friends of Harvard Ice Hockey. “Harvard hockey players are close to their classmates, but this is a four-year window of friends for life that we have.”
The get-together also served as a celebration of a truly dominant stretch in the hockey program’s history — in no small part due to the caliber of players that comprised those squads. In the seven seasons leading up to and including the fateful championship year, the Crimson reached the NCAA Tournament all but once. By late March, 1989, Harvard had advanced to the semifinal round in three of its last four campaigns, with the 1983 and 1986 teams earning a heartbreaking second place. In short, by 1989, the program craved a fleeting first-place finish and place atop college hockey for all of time.
The group’s senior leadership remembered the painful runner-up finish in 1986 all too well. The Crimson took a 4-3 lead into the final frame only to squander it to two Michigan St. tallies in the opening minutes of the period. With just three minutes remaining in the tilt and the game knotted at five apiece, Spartan standout forward Mike Donnelly stole the trophy away from Harvard with his game-winning goal.
“We played in the National Championship game in ’86,” Krayer began. “We thought we had that game won. We were beating Michigan St. after two periods. We thought we were there. But we lost it. So, there were six of us who were there in the room in ’89 to make sure that that wasn’t going to happen again.”
The loss was a true testament to hockey’s tendency to be decided by the narrowest of margins, the slightest of mistakes, and the shortest of momentum swings. And for the Crimson, it stung. Because of it, most members of the 1986 team never tasted a national title.
Yet, hockey has a funny way of restoring justice. Upon re-watching Harvard’s only college hockey crown to date, the 1989 alumni realized that the “hockey gods” may have returned the favor from 1986’s heartbreak after all. In the first period, Krayer put a hit on an opposing Minnesota player that sent him crashing dangerously into the corner-boards — reason for a penalty back then and almost certainly worthy of ejection in today’s game. Luckily, the Gophers player avoided injury, and the play went uncalled, keeping Krayer in the game to score the overtime clincher.
And that goal changed everything. It’s the reason over half the 1989 team gravitated back toward the Bright earlier this month, and it’s a major reason why the group remains so close, even after three decades of careers and families.
“Coach Cleary had a great line in the locker room before we went out on the ice for overtime,” Krayer recalled. “He said, ‘Guys, if we win this one, we walk together forever.’ And we did. And we do…. We went through a once-in-a-lifetime experience together, so the bonds are tight, the friendships are close. It’s really pretty special.”
As this year’s Harvard team prepares for an NCAA Tournament run of its own, the lasting impact of the 1989 National Championship is palpable.
It doesn’t hurt that the Most Outstanding Player of that year’s tournament currently mans the Crimson bench. Now in his 15th season in the role, Ted Donato has firmly reestablished the winning culture to which he grew accustomed in his playing days, but that eluded the program for the better part of the 1990s. Year in and year out, the team’s goal — its lofty expectation — is to win a Division-I title.
“You come to college to win a National Championship,” said current co-captain Michael Floodstrand, shortly after the selection show on Sunday. “The number-one thing is just being able to play as long as you can with the guys you’ve been working and sweating with all year. That’s the thing that motivates me and motivates the guys that have been there.”
This culture, and Donato’s overall approach to coaching young men, draw direct inspiration from the way Cleary cultivated one of the most successful eras in Harvard hockey history.
“The simplest connection would be that my goal is to have our guys have the kind of experience that coach Cleary provided for us,” Donato said. “Coach Cleary had a unique way of filling us all with a lot of confidence…a way of really empowering the players into thinking that there was nothing that we couldn’t accomplish.”
Reaching college hockey’s pinnacle was undeniably a highlight of Donato’s Harvard experience, as it was for Hughes, Krayer, MacDonald, and others. An extra emotional layer thus exists beneath the surface of Donato’s coaching: knowing the ongoing brotherhood and sense of accomplishment resulting from his own national title, the bench boss strives to give his players the same experience.
When Harvard takes the ice on Friday afternoon, looking to ignite a deep NCAA run with a win over the Minutemen, Donato and his 1989 teammates will be pulling especially hard for their alma mater. Thirty years after their triumphant evening in St. Paul, Minn., the profound pride and glory live on.

What’s the better way to suffer: writing papers or doing psets? The debate is older than Harvard itself. Let’s settle this once and for all with some ~spicy~ points from our writers.
Papers: Rachel L. Reynolds and Stuti R. Telidevara
Objectively, papers win over psets every time. First of all, they’re at least a little more fun because you get to actually be creative. Can you put a fun, punny title on a pset? Didn’t think so. Not to mention, as long as you have the evidence to back you up, you can basically write whatever you want. There’s no set answer, so you can fake your way through a paper much more easily than a pset. Plus, you can justify basically any procrastination as part of the “writing process.” On the other hand, when you’re doing a pset, you’re either working or feeling awful about yourself for not working. And why be at the mercy of a study group to save you, when you can just grind it out yourself while listening to that perfect writing playlist you made in order to procrastinate even more? We all know there’s a clear winner here.
Problem Sets: Peyton A. Jones and Hannah J. Humes
Everyone loves to complain about psets, but they’re truly the only tolerable form of classwork. First things first: There’s actually a right answer. While a particular TF’s strictness can make or break your essay grade in a non-pset class, the right answer on a pset is all you need. Of course, getting to that correct solution is easier said than done. Luckily, the time-honored tradition of collaboration on tough problems makes the process doable (while abiding by the Honor Code of course). Late nights in the library working through difficult questions and/or cycling through the five stages of grief bond pset classmates together for life and help even the most notoriously grindy of courses (“Chemistry 27: Organic Chemistry of Life,” we’re looking at you) seem manageable. But if you and your study buddies’ collective brainpower just can’t hack a particularly impossible problem, fret not — office hours for pset classes are actually helpful. Gone are the days of vague feedback in essay-writing classes. And if all of the above points still leave you stranded, you’ve got one last shot: the magic of YouTube. Don’t understand how your friends and TFs are explaining a problem? Google your way into understanding. If you’re not #TeamPset by now, you might just have bad taste.
