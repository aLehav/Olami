After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To find the last time Harvard men’s volleyball started a season with three consecutive losses, you would have to go back to 2010, in what was coach Brian Baise’s second year at the helm. That season, the team ended up finishing with a final record of 5-16, its worst ever as a member of the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association.
Fast forward six years and the Crimson found itself trying to avoid a similarly inauspicious start to the season as it entered a Sunday night matchup against the King University Tornado. After suffering losses to No. 8 Lewis and No. 7 Hawaii, Baise’s squad hoped to grab its first win before leaving the Outrigger Resorts Invitational in Honolulu.
“This is the first time we’ve been a part of this Invitational, and we would have been really disappointed to leave without winning at least one game,” Harvard captain Branden Clemens said.
Behind a strong performance by Clemens and fellow senior outside hitter Alec Schlossman, however, Harvard (1-2) defeated King (0-3) in straight sets, 25-12, 23-17, 25-17.
The Crimson took control right from the start, jumping out to a 17-7 lead in the first set. Despite three service errors that halted momentum, Harvard rode its power game to ultimately take the set, 25-12. Clemens and Schlossman paced the team with four kills apiece.
“In the past couple of years, we’ve struggled with coming out flat against teams that we knew we could beat,” Schlossman said. “But that didn’t happen tonight. It was good to come out from the get-go and establish ourselves.”
The second set followed a similar pattern. The Tornado never led as Crimson middle blocker Trevor Dow, who stands at 6’10”, staked his team to an early 6-2 lead with a pair of kills. Dow, a freshman making his first collegiate start, finished with six kills in a strong debut performance.
“We’re all proud of how Trevor played,” Clemens said. “To come in like that in his first game was really impressive. We’re excited to see how he’s going to contribute the rest of the season.”
Dow will be competing for a spot in the starting lineup with fellow freshman middle blocker Spencer Scott, who saw action in Harvard’s first two contests.
Behind the play of Clemens, Schlossman, and Dow, the Crimson looked to comfortably put away King once again in the third set. This time, however, the Tornado matched Harvard point for point, kill for kill. At one point, the teams combined for seven straight kills in what was an exciting, back and forth sequence.
While Clemens continued to dominate at the net for the Crimson, recording four more kills to finish with 11, King sophomore outside hitter Jeff Sprayberry tallied four of his own to keep the Tornado close. Sprayberry finished with six kills total, tied for the team lead with senior middle blocker Matthew Lychock.
At 18-17, with Harvard holding the slim lead, Sprayberry served to try to tie the game once again for King. However, Dow earned his final kill to restore a two-point lead for the Crimson, which did not drop another point. Sophomore setter Marko Kostich took control, ripping off four aces in five points, including three in a row to end the game.
“We knew they weren’t going to go down without a fight, but luckily, Marko caught fire from the service line,” Schlossman said. “That was something that helped us the whole game. We put a lot of pressure on them from the service line, and that made it easier for our defense as well.”
Kostich’s flurry to finish the match punctuated a dominant victory for Harvard, which ended up with a 10-2 edge in service aces and a 43-23 advantage in kills. Led by seven digs apiece from Kostich, junior libero Samuel Murphy, and junior outside hitter Casey White, the Crimson also had 31 digs to 23 for the Tornado.
Overall, it was a complete and convincing win for Harvard, which leaves Hawaii with experience against several of the top-ranked teams in the country.
“I’m very happy with how the weekend played out,” Clemens said. “If you told me beforehand we would take Lewis to give sets and beat King, I would have taken it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With his well-placed rail that forced a tin by his opponent on a volley drop attempt to end the match, freshman Alexi Gosset polished off a decisive Harvard victory over No. 11 Princeton on Sunday at the Murr Center.
Fresh off a 6-3 win over No. 2 Penn on Saturday, the No. 8 men’s squash team carried momentum over into Sunday to get its record above .500 for the first time this season.
The Crimson (2-1, 2-1 Ivy) did not waste its chance against the Tigers (2-6, 0-2), as it swept its fellow Ivy League competitor in convincing fashion, 9-0, for the second time in three seasons.
“It was a very clinical performance from the guys just because they held it together on their own,” junior co-captain Bryan Koh said. “[Some] performed really well, not dropping any games, but even the guys who dropped some games did really well to catch themselves and come back strong.”
Five members of the Harvard squad—sophomores David Ryan, Bradley Smith, and Madhav Dhingra, junior Dylan Murray, and Gosset—were able to cruise to 3-0 victories against their Princeton counterparts. For Smith, the win represented his first victory at the No. 2 slot this season.
After his 10-0 record in match play mainly at the No. 5 position a year ago, Ryan was able to brush off his first ever loss in a regular season match, which came on Saturday against Penn, to secure his second win at the top slot in his career.
The only match to reach a fifth game against the Tigers was at No. 8 between Haravrd sophomore Seif Eleinen and Princeton freshman William Oon. Following an 11-9 loss in the first game, Eleinen fought back in the next two to take a 2-1 lead over his opponent, but a 11-5 defeat in the fourth forced a decisive fifth game.
“Seif's match at position eight was really hotly contested,” sophomore Mandela Patrick said. “They both traded the first four games, but Seif kept his cool and composure to win the fifth in commanding fashion.”
After tinning a forehand drop from backcourt to reduce his lead in the fifth, 5-4, Eleinen never let up and rolled to a strong finish. Stretching his opponent across all corners of the court with resilient frontcourt play and tight rails, the Alexandria, Egypt native pulled out the victory, 11-6, helping to preserve the Crimson’s sweep.
“I think that’s something that we are all learning to build into our game,” Koh said. “Just to hang in there longer, open up, and play the extra shot. It’s important to come through in these five gamers, [and] it’ll only do well for his confidence.”
Koh overcame some adversity in his own match against Cambridge, Mass., product Cody Cortes at position three. Conceding a 1-0 deficit to the Tiger freshman, the junior won the next three games without much trouble.  Patrick and junior Devin McLaughlin were also victorious in four, both dropping a game, 11-3, in their respective matches after pulling out to an early lead.
At the seventh position, Harvard’s Gosset was able to best Princeton sophomore Abhimanyu Shah, 11-4, 11-5, 11-4. Shah was the lone winner in the team’s match against No. 7 Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., on Saturday. After losing his first career match for the Crimson in its 5-4 loss to the Big Green in December, the rookie has responded well with two convincing victories in his most recent contests.
In fact, the whole squad has responded to the uninspiring performance in the season opener.  Admittedly a major wake-up call for Harvard, the Dartmouth loss seems to have focused the entire team in recent weeks, resulting in the strong play that was witnessed on Sunday.
“I think mentally we are in much better shape than we were in December,” Koh said. “Right now I think the team is in a good place. We are all working as a unit and everyone is mentally and physically strong. So going forward we are just going to keep it up, stick to our program, and believe in ourselves.”
