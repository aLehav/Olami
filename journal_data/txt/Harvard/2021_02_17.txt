After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, in an open letter to his science adviser and nominee for a new cabinet-level science policy position, President Joe Biden asked Eric Lander, a systems biology professor at Harvard Medical School and director of Harvard and MIT’s Broad Institute, to urgently consider the growing interplay between science and society.
This letter arrives as we are at a juncture in scientific history. Especially visibly during this pandemic, science and technology are far more intimately connected to our national security, information dissemination, and economy than ever before. In his letter, Biden poses several critical questions: How will our public health system learn from the pandemic? How will America ensure our global leadership in technology, address climate change, and guarantee that the rewards of science and tech are shared across the country?
Most importantly, however, Biden highlights the need to secure the “long-term health of science and technology in our nation.” If we need to transition entire campus infrastructures online, roll out vaccines at breakneck speed, and combat distrust of public health guidelines, if we want to address the questions posed above, then the underlying scientific and technological frameworks need to be secure.
Biden calling attention to science in this way is a welcome shift from the science denial we’ve been witnessing for the past four years. As John Holdren, former President Barack Obama’s science adviser and Harvard Kennedy School professor of Environmental Policy, affirms, steps are being taken to put us in the right direction.
“I think the Executive Orders issued by President Biden on climate change, jobs, equity, immigration, scientific integrity, and [the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology] are further evidence of his determination to get the restoration of the role of science, technology, and facts in the Executive Branch off to a flying start,” Holdren wrote in an email to The Crimson.
But the question of scientific longevity is not as straightforward as you may think. Science research, constrained by intellectual and resource limitations, has strayed from the truth-seeking discipline it often claims to be.
"[T]here's a lot of inertia and a lot of difficulty funding the truly deep questions and identifying new areas of ignorance," according to Michael Levin, a biology professor and Vannevar Bush endowed chair at Tufts University, and associate faculty at Harvard's Wyss Institute.
“There's a lot of pressure to design projects in a way that's not going to upset existing paradigms and concepts, and that will be able to go through [the review process] without sounding too unfamiliar or different from the mainstream,” Levin said in an interview with The Crimson. “And I think that's a problem. I think we need to be rewarding creativity and divergent thinking.”
So what does rewarding creativity actually look like?
This column will examine factors that obscure truth-seeking in scientific research, such as funding mechanisms, irreproducibility, peer review, and barriers to science communication. We must confront how our current academic structures and institutions promote thinking inside the box instead of encouraging scientific daring.
But though science has become constricted by funding pressures, I find so many reasons to be hopeful that science’s public significance is being elevated. The last time a president wrote such a letter to his science advisor, America was emerging from a similar and very different crisis: World War II. In 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt Class of 1904 wrote to his science adviser, MIT Vice President Vannevar Bush, for advice on how to expand on the science learned during the war, the government’s role in managing private and public research, and the future of scientific talent. Bush’s response, a report titled “Science: The Endless Frontier,” allowed the United States to emerge as a global leader in scientific innovation.
Still, as Bush insightfully pointed out nearly 80 years ago, it is important to remember that “much of new knowledge is certain to arouse opposition because of its tendency to challenge current beliefs or practice.” In his view, good science requires “solidarity and security, as well as a substantial degree of personal intellectual freedom.”
The best possible future is one where the long-term health of science is preserved, one where we continue exploring, examining critically, and improving lives. That kind of science requires fresh ideas rather than stagnant, repetitive solutions — ideas that require the intellectual freedom Bush advocated. Researchers must be able to try and fail and learn from it, to hypothesize and experiment correctly, honestly, and inventively.
“The only way to new knowledge is to bust your butt in the laboratory and or in some setting and ask nature questions and be honest about what the answers that you get are,” Levin said. Science, he says, is “a magical machine for generating new knowledge, and that is the only one we have.”
And since this magical machine is a work in progress reliant on public support, we must foster an emphasis on truth-seeking and out-of-the-box thinking. At its core, science is correct, honest, and inventive work. That’s why it’s so crucial that we think big and challenge paradigms along this endless frontier.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s a folder in my Google Drive for unpublished, unpitched articles intended for The Crimson. Mostly political commentaries, each piece usually calls for more ideological inclusion or debunks another stereotype about Harvard conservatives. In the end, though, I never hit send; I enumerate excuses. It needs more edits. Fewer words. I’m too busy.
But I’ve been fooling myself. It’s fear, not a lack of refinement, that characterizes this unpublished folder.
One of these pieces in particular forced me to confront the reality of my fear. It was a fiery dissent to The Crimson’s staff editorial, “Politics is Personal — Expect It” from December of 2020. For me, one of the more shocking claims made by The Editorial Board was that conservatives asking for ideological representation do not “by virtue of their ideologies, deserve the same protections or support … minorities need.” Their desire for as much would be “misleading and manipulative.”
I was immediately compelled to respond to the erroneous, implicit assumption that conservatives are striving for minority status at Harvard — quite the bold claim made by an overwhelmingly liberal Editorial Board. As a Crimson Editorial staff writer, I find conservative stereotypes like these to be rampant among the Editorial Board and part of the reason why my attendance at meetings is so sparse.
While I cannot speak for all conservatives, I have never hoped to be ideologically represented as, or at the expense of, a minority group — and know that many of my conservative friends would say the same. The suggestion is offensive, presumptuous, and an unproductive deflection. It justifies further isolating non-liberals from what is seen as mainstream discourse on campus.
Most of all, I was struck by the idea that conservative representation and minority representation are somehow mutually exclusive. For one, there are conservative students who also identify as members of historically marginalized groups. Are we suggesting that the two identities are incongruous?
To conflate minority representation with the exclusion of conservative voices is to further deny already marginalized identities of their agency to make political choices. More than that, there can and should be space for both minority representation and a more balanced ideological environment at Harvard.
Diversity is a good thing to be sure. But is it the only good thing? What about ideological diversity? Students should advocate for a variety of convictions. Minority representation is important but that does not mean that ideological diversity has to be unimportant. In the end, both can broaden personal and intellectual horizons.
After finishing the draft of my dissenting op-ed, I was admittedly excited. Hopefully, I could debunk some misconceptions, make a small change. But a knot grew in my stomach, as it always does, as I read and reread. To touch on the subject of minority representation is a social gamble at Harvard, a seemingly endless list of “dos and don’ts” with little forgiveness when one stumbles, and little room to ask earnest, learning questions. I want to better understand inclusion issues or potentially offer other avenues towards equity, but it’s hard to openly think critically about the dominant narrative for fear of being labeled as insensitive.
I was particularly worried about the level of higher scrutiny that comes with being a non-liberal at Harvard. Especially recently, after a chaotic post-election season, some Republicans have deservedly come under fire. But that also has made it even harder for conservatives, who are often inaccurately lumped in with President Trump and his destabilizing behavior, to feel free to speak out. I have experienced this firsthand, being told that “we don’t need people like conservatives” or “I don’t care about how conservatives feel” in Harvard-sponsored political conversations.
Attitudes like these – attitudes of ideological conformity and exclusion — left me with a deep sense of dread as I did one final skim of my piece.
My unpublished dissent also touched on the staff editorials assertion that conservatives must come to terms with their views being “perfectly reasonable grounds for the judgment of their peers” and that there is “a reciprocal freedom to react, dissent, and protest those opinions” — a point that is true but laughably ironic at Harvard.
There’s nothing “reciprocal” about campus discourse. Losing friends and being labeled as hateful are just some of the reasons conservatives, myself included, keep our heads down. On top of the astronomical social cost, there are also few platforms for conservatives to “react, dissent, and protest.”
So, in the end, I tucked the piece away. More edits? More time?
It was fear. Fear of being misrepresented, mislabelled. Fear of being shunned. And it’s the same fear that almost made me turn down this column.
I’ve always wanted to write a Crimson column during my senior spring. But when the time came to apply this January, I clammed up. A column means deadlines and visibility. I could no longer make excuses or hide in my secret folder.
Before throwing out the possibility, a sense of guilt gave me pause. If someone doesn’t speak out, will anything change? Shouldn’t I be able to share my views? Harvard is an academic institution, after all, and the exchange of ideas should not be an anxiety-inducing ordeal; it should be foundational to intellectual growth.
Most of all, I was guilty about continually caving to a system of social pressure, shame, and ideological conformity. I was ashamed to care so much about what others thought about me to the point that I would hide my own convictions.
I spent a lot of time talking to my friends, asking them about the risks of writing a column. Each responded with an answer and a question. You will be scrutinized. But is it worth it?
I’ve decided it is. I’ve decided that Harvard certainly has room for new voices. Voices that do not steal space, but hopefully offer something new and enriching.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A key point of contention between my parents and me recently is if I am really queer or just confused. You know, because being gay is a trend nowadays. “Love, Simon” made it cool or whatever.
To that, I say, there is nothing really fun about being queer in this world, unless you count having your rights debated as a political issue, being either demonized or fetishized depending on whether your existence threatens or turns on straight people, getting hate crimed, being at a higher risk for mental health issues, knowing there are some things that your family’s supposedly unconditional love won’t cover, or being illegal in 72 countries simply because of who you are. The fun parts about being queer — Pride Month and ball culture and banger music and memes about falling in love with our best friends — are things we had to dig down and claw into existence in our own little spaces; they exist precisely because being queer in a largely homophobic and transphobic world is so unfun.
Sure, there are some people who see being queer as a trend, who want in on whatever clout being bisexual gives you (if there is any such clout, please direct me towards it, because I would like to have that instead of just internalized and external biphobia). There are people who mess around with labels and ultimately declare themselves cisgender or straight. So what? People change. Identities change, or our perceptions of them change, or the labels that make us feel best about ourselves change. The Q in BGLTQ does sometimes stand for questioning. There’s no harm done if someone questions their gender or sexuality for a couple of months before realizing that they are in fact cishet. It’s probably better for people to question and explore their gender and sexual identities than to take the social norm of cis- and heteronormativity as indisputable truth, anyways.
But there is harm in assuming because some people come out as queer and later identify themselves as cis or straight, that no one is queer, only confused. That everyone who comes out is dazed by the Pride parade glitter and doing it as a fad.
Coming out is hard. It’s terrifying. So much so that a younger me decided I would just never tell my parents about my sexuality until I realized that eventually, I might end up marrying a woman — and then that would be even harder to explain to my parents at the wedding. We all know the horror stories: getting kicked out of your home, conversion therapy, or getting sent to “pray the gay away.” How we can lose the love of our loved ones because of who we are or who we love. I know many people who continue to put off telling their parents because they don’t know what might happen, or they’re afraid they do. I know many people, myself among them, for whom coming out to their parents has permanently altered their relationship.
Even when coming out goes okay (hooray for basic human decency!) — like in the TikTok compilations of supportive family members’ reactions to coming out that I like to watch when I feel alone — it’s emotional. People cry. There’s catharsis there, whether in finally getting to be out and proud of yourself or in the relief of finding out that you will not be another coming-out-gone-wrong story.
No matter how coming out goes, it’s a big deal and not something to be taken lightly. It takes so much bravery to come out. To say to the world or maybe just the people you care about that this is who I am and how I love when large swathes of the world will hate you for that alone. If someone gathers the courage and strength to come out to you, they do not deserve to be met with skepticism. It could not have been easy for them to come to terms with their own identity, to war within themself over who to tell and how, and to finally say those words to you.
It costs you nothing to respect someone exploring their identity. It costs them a lot to share that exploration with you. So be kind. No one comes out for fun. We do it because we are in the process of understanding ourselves. And if we share that self-expression with you, you’d better appreciate it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, a dozen students who transfer to Harvard College from other universities must quickly adapt to Harvard traditions, academics, and campus social life.
The coronavirus pandemic and a remote academic year has made it even harder for them to find their footing at Harvard, several of this year’s transfer students said.
“I feel like if there weren’t Covid, I would probably have made more friends in person and known more people,” said Anna C. Clark ’23, who transferred to Harvard this academic year from Northwestern University and is currently living on campus. “I think it’s definitely harder with Covid.”
Harvard College accepts roughly 12 students out of 1,500 transfer applicants to join the College as a sophomore or junior each fall, according to the Harvard admissions website, marking an acceptance rate of less than 1 percent.
Students who transferred to the College this academic year said they faced acute social isolation. While the College invited freshmen to live in Harvard’s dorms for the fall semester, the College did not grant the same opportunity to transfer students, who were left to enter Harvard’s gates virtually on Zoom, although they could petition to live on campus due to challenging home environments like all other students.
Brittany J. Rosendaul ’22, who transferred to Harvard this year from the University of Toledo, said she felt “caught between two worlds” as a transfer student living at home in Toledo, Ohio.
“It’s very difficult to transfer into a new school and be stuck so far away,” Rosendaul said. “It would be a lot easier being on campus, even just for being around the other transfer students, just because we’re all kind of in the same boat.”
“Meeting people in general is really difficult right now,” she added.
Transfer students Jacob K. Ostfeld ’23 and Claudia V. Cabral ’22 wrote a letter to top College administrators in November requesting that it extend on-campus living to all new transfer students. Though transfer students were eligible to petition for campus housing, Ostfeld explained that he believes the College should have prioritized transfer students in its plans for residential life on campus this year.
All but one transfer student signed the letter in solidarity, per Ostfeld. The College never granted the request.
Ostfeld, who transferred after his freshman year at Brandeis University, said he was frustrated by the lack of support the College provided him and other transfer students. Ostfeld said the only support he received was a Harvard-led orientation that lasted a total of two hours on Zoom.
“Although I really like Harvard, and I like how this past academic semester has gone and is going, it really sucks,” Ostfeld said. “It would be nice to have a single acknowledgement from the administration that we exist.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on students’ criticisms.
To support their transition, Harvard holds an orientation program for transfer students and connects them with an adviser and students who previously transferred, per the College website.
Jordan L. Kruguer ’21, a peer advisor for transfer students, said this year’s remote format has weakened connections among transfer students.
“The transfer community is extremely tightly knit,” Kruguer said. “We would always have transfer brunch every Sunday in Quincy, and we haven’t had things like that.”
Still, several students said their adviser, Currier House Resident Dean Amanda S. Lobell ’99, made their transition to Harvard less stressful.
Lobell, who is a former transfer student herself, wrote in an emailed statement that she hopes to make students “feel at home” at Harvard.
“This year was challenging for everyone as normal processes were interrupted by the pandemic,” Lobell wrote. “Everyone at the College is excited to welcome all our students, including this year’s transfers, to campus as soon as we’re safely able.”
By the time it becomes safe for transfer students to experience life on Harvard’s campus, Rosendaul said her college career will almost be over.
“I’m only going to have two semesters on campus, and so I’m three-quarters of the way through undergrad,” Rosendaul said. “I go to school at Harvard, but have never stepped foot on the campus.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard History professor Fredrik Logevall presented his research on the political development of former President John F. Kennedy ’40 while he was a student at Harvard College at a virtual Harvard Kennedy School forum Tuesday.
Tuesday's conversation, which was moderated by Pulitzer-prize winning historian and biographer Jon E. Meacham, centered around Logevall's recent book “JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century, 1917-1956," which recounts the early life of Kennedy, who was a former Crimson editor.
The Institute of Politics, which hosted the event, was founded as a memorial to Kennedy, who is also the namesake of the school.
Logevall spoke about Kennedy’s increasing interest in politics as a student at the College. Though other scholars have depicted Kennedy as a “slacker” during his time as an undergraduate, Logevall said he was surprised to learn that Kennedy was an earnest student of international affairs and history.
Logevall also said Kennedy disagreed with his father Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., who graduated from the College in 1912, over whether the United States should intervene in World War II.
“[John Kennedy] concludes, as a student here, a junior and a senior, that isolationism is probably untenable for the United States that we have to probably at some point intervene, we certainly need to prepare for intervention,” he said.
This view differed not only from his father, but also from many of his classmates at Harvard.
“One of the surprising things in my research was that the student body here was staunchly isolationist, something like 90 to 95 percent,” Logevall said. “When the Harvard Crimson would do surveys, a huge majority said we want nothing to do with this European war.”
Logevall said Kennedy’s “internationalist sensibility” stemmed from his bedridden childhood and influences from his mother and Harvard professors.
“I present a flawed figure, a gifted and flawed figure, but I do think he had greatness within him,” Logevall added.
Logevall gave advice to President Joseph Biden based on Kennedy’s life.
"Follow your instinct, which I think is to argue for the things that bring Americans together more than what sets them apart,” he said. “And I also believe, though it can seem quaint and naive, in our current age, that Kennedy's emphasis on bargaining in good faith with members of the opposing party, ultimately, I think our democracy is going to need that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A petition calling on Harvard Law School to bar former Trump administration officials and politicians who were “complicit” in the former administration’s “immoral” actions from joining the school’s ranks garnered more than 200 signatures from HLS affiliates as of Tuesday.
Addressed to Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 and other administrators, the petition described the Capitol Hill riots on Jan. 6 as “a shocking and horrifying attack,” and argued that the University’s values are “incompatible” with the Trump administration’s “abhorrent acts.”
“Harvard Law School must refuse to serve as a tool to launder the reputations of those who crafted and enabled the Trump administration’s anti-democratic, anti-immigrant, racist, and morally reprehensible abuses,” the letter read. “We call on Harvard to commit that it will not hire or affiliate with any senior official in the Trump administration or Congressional leader who was complicit in the administration’s immoral actions.”
Emma R. Leibowitz, a first year Law student and member of the Harvard chapter of the People’s Parity Project, said she and several other colleagues felt compelled to create the petition following the Capitol insurrection.
“It was such a stark and striking culmination of the anti-democratic, racist, xenophobic policies and rhetoric that the administration and its major supporters in Congress espoused,” Leibowitz said.
The petition requested a response from administrators by Feb. 10, but none came, per Leibowitz.
Harvard Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on the petition.
In a faculty meeting earlier this month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow defended the importance of free speech at Harvard, but also said that those who appoint individuals to positions at the University should bear the responsibility of defending their appointees’ worthiness in those roles.
Amanda A. Harris, a first year Law student, said she learned about the petition on social media and signed it because of Harvard Law School's influence.
“Our institution occupies a place of great power and influence in the legal space and in American democracy and history in general,” she said. “It felt important to me to voice my opinion that we should not lend that institutional validation to anti-democratic actors who I believe are involved in the Trump administration.”
Sibo Wang, another first year student at the Law School, said he signed on because he believes the University should play a role in standing up to government actors who abuse their power.
“I signed the petition because I believe that Harvard Law School can be a leader in ensuring that there is accountability for not only the institution itself, also for everyone who is affiliated with the institution,” Wang said.
The Law School, Leibowitz said, bears the responsibility to ensure that members of the Trump administration are held accountable after they have left the White House.
“To me, Harvard Law has a huge role to play in telling those people that they can’t so easily come back into polite society after they have used their legal training to really promulgate a terrible set of policies that have really harmed people,” Leibowitz said.
Kurt D. Walters, a third year student and petition signatory, said former President Donald Trump’s aquittal in his second impeachment trial substantiates a failure of government to hold political actors accountable for their misdeeds.
“A large number of people are desperate to just bury this all under the rug, sweep this under the rug, and try to pretend like the events of the past four years did not happen,” Walters said.
Walters also said he believes the Law School cannot successfully uphold its values without taking action toward people who contributed to the Trump administration's “anti-democratic nature.” He cited the Law School's mission to "educate leaders who contribute to the advancement of justice and the well-being of society."
“Those of us who helped create this letter, and those of us who signed this letter feel that it would be impossible for Harvard to live up to its values while inviting in the architects and enablers of the abuses of the past four years into the Harvard community,” Walters said.
The petition garnered more than 200 signatures as of Tuesday night, and includes the support of La Alianza, a Latinx affinity group at the Law School.
“It’s a topic that has the ability to spread organically because it’s really important,” Leibowitz said.
Wang said that rather than supporting a political party, the petition aligned with values respected across the aisle.
“To be very, very clear, none of this is about partisanship,” Wang said. “It is about the values that we claim we espouse and uphold, regardless of party or ideology, and we need to be consistent and stick to that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union ratified a new contract with the University Friday, maintaining healthcare benefits, securing bonuses, and codifying avenues to collaborate with the much larger clerical and technical workers union.
HUSPMGU — which represents approximately 80 staff members at Harvard — voted overwhelmingly for ratification, with 79 percent of the union participating in the vote and 98 percent of voters favoring the new contract. The new, short-term agreement, which expires Sept. 30, is largely an extension of the union’s 2016 contract that expired June 30, 2020.
The most notable changes to the contract include one-time bonuses, inclusion in zero-interest housing loan programs already established for Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers members, and the creation of a working group to discuss a possible merger between HUSPMGU and HUCTW, the largest union on campus.
“Given the circumstances, we’re satisfied, and obviously our membership seemed to be satisfied,” HUSPMGU Treasurer Sean F. McNally said. “It was very humbling that so many of our colleagues voted in favor of the ratification.”
Negotiations with Harvard began last summer and finished in December, according to McNally. HUSPMGU leadership invited HUCTW negotiators to participate in the negotiations, as they did in 2016.
The two unions first proposed a merger ahead of those negotiations in 2016, though the University rejected the plan due to what it says are legal restrictions against employees classified as “guards” being included in a union with non-guards. Harvard also cited the same reasoning in rejecting another attempt by the two unions to merge in 2019.
As the smallest union at Harvard, HUSPMGU favors merging with HUCTW for financial growth and stronger representation, McNally said. HUCTW represents more than 5,000 Harvard employees.
“We really wanted to bridge that gap between HUSPMGU members and pretty much everyone else in the University,” he said. “We appear to have fallen behind or not gained financially the same as our peers.”
HUCTW Executive Director Bill Jaeger said representatives from both unions have worked together closer over the past few years to form a “powerful partnership.”
“We were really happy to be able to play a more involved part in and work with the elected leaders of HUSPMGU to get more directly involved in the HUSPMGU negotiations,” Jaeger said.
In addition to maintaining healthcare benefits from their previous contract, HUSPMGU members will each receive a one-time “hardship” bonus of approximately $135. Members who work 40 hours per week will receive an additional bonus of $1,500 and another smaller bonus on July 1.
HUSPMGU members will also have access to zero-interest housing loan programs from the Harvard University Employees Credit Union facilitated by HUCTW.
“It just seemed like a really good opportunity to bring HUSPMGU more into the mainstream and to include HUSPMGU members in some really good programming that can really help people, especially lower-paid employees in certain kinds of stressful housing situations,” Jaeger said.
More broadly, the new working group under the contract will allow HUSPMGU, HUCTW, and the University to continue a dialogue about a merger between the two unions.
“That provision of the contract just represents hope and constructive determination to persevere on the part of HUSPMGU and HUCTW members,” Jaeger said. “We really wanted to ask the University to make a commitment to continue to engage in those kinds of discussions in good faith and continue trying to find a way that works for all the parties to accomplish that goal.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard has already discussed the relationship between the two unions, but will meet with HUSPMGU on the matter.
“As part of the new contract, the University has agreed to meet with HUSPMGU with regards to their relationship with HUCTW,” Newton wrote. “This is, however, a matter the University has addressed with HUSPMGU a few times over the last several years.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 34 years in Harvard Square, Border Cafe has shuttered its doors permanently following a two-alarm fire in December 2019 that forced the restaurant to temporarily close for building repairs.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, confirmed that the once-vibrant restaurant located on 32 Church Street has permanently closed. She said she initially expected Border to recover from the fire.
“The damage was at a minimum from what we understood,” Jillson said. “And then, of course, Covid-19 hit and everything changed.”
The winner of Flyby’s guac competition, Border Cafe was known for its large portions of Tex-Mex and Cajun dishes at affordable prices and its lively environment. As Harvard students and alumni mourned the loss of the iconic establishment, they shared heartfelt stories of family get-togethers and social events at Border Cafe.
Yu Wong ’94 said his first experience at Border Cafe took place after the conclusion of the First-Year Outdoor Program before the start of his freshman year.
“After we checked into our dorm rooms, we met at the Border for our first official dine-in meal in the Square, and I’ll never forget that, especially after a week of eating nothing but gorp, nuts, and M&Ms,” he said. “Having real food at the Border was very memorable.”
“When I think of Harvard Square, Border Cafe is one of the immediate dining institutions that I associate with it, and many others have closed over the years that I used to frequent,” he added. “So it’s sad to see another one go.”
Jania J. Tumey ’23 said her most “memorable time” at Border Cafe was on her 20th birthday.
“Border Cafe was my favorite restaurant in the Square, probably in the whole Boston area,” Tumey, a former Crimson News editor, said. “My friends secretly asked our server to bring me a slice of cake, but they didn’t have cake, so he brought me a piece of cornbread with a candle in it.”
“It was perfect for me because I love cornbread,” she added.
For Angelina V. Shoemaker ’22, Border Cafe was a “nostalgic place” that she dreamt of returning to after graduating from Harvard. Shoemaker said she often frequented Border Cafe when her family came to visit her on campus.
“We would go there probably once a semester as a family, but when my aunt came to visit me, which was probably like three times a semester, I would also go there with her. It was very much a regular spot,” Shoemaker said.
Cara J. Kupferman ’20 said her and her family’s love for Border Cafe dates back to the early 90s, when her parents would go to Jose Tejas, a restaurant under the same parent company as Border Cafe.
“For my entire life, my family has driven 40 minutes in each direction to go to Jose Tejas in New Jersey every few months as our family's favorite treat,” Kupferman said. “When I came to Harvard and discovered there was essentially a Jose Tejas in the neighborhood, it was just so exciting.”
Kathy Ling ’22 said she only went to Border Cafe once, but the one time she went was “very meaningful.”
“Every year, my freshman dorm proctor would take all his entryway kids out to Border Cafe at the end of the year and he would buy fajitas for the whole table,” she said. “It was very, very nice because it was a great way to close out the year.”
Some students said they remembered the last time they dined at Border Cafe.
Seth D. Billiau ’21 said he went to the Border “once a week.”
“The last time that I went was my 21st birthday in October 2019,” he said. “I was a steak fajitas guy. I loved going with friends, because you could get a table for six and everyone could get something at a reasonable price.”
Seung Min “Albert” Shin ’22, who last went to Border Cafe for a post-performance celebration, said the cafe had “astronomical” portions and “excellent service.”
“I was involved in Harvard Expressions on campus, and I remember we had this small get-together before the holidays started,” Shin said. “We went on November 21st.”
Jillson said she would miss the “loud, boisterous, wonderful” music emanating from Border.
“It was just loud, boisterous, wonderful music, always playing at the Border, and it spilled out onto the street,” she said. “Church Street can be a little quiet, so to have all that activity at the corner of Church and Brattle because of the Border was really very special.”
Tumey said she wishes Harvard would use its “massive endowment” to save Border Cafe.
“Saving Border, I think, plausibly falls under the umbrella of student wellness,” she said. “In my vision, in addition to saving Border, Harvard would subsidize dinner for every student at Border.”
“You never know what you have until it’s gone,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lee Yong-soo, a surviving “comfort woman” and activist, former United States Rep. Michael M. “Mike” Honda (D-Calif.), and other advocates for comfort women spoke at a virtual roundtable hosted by Harvard Law students Tuesday evening aimed at “debunking denialism” on the issue.
With more than 500 attendees, the webinar, which was hosted by the Harvard Asian Pacific American Law Students Association, highlighted activism around recognizing and reparating comfort women, a term for sex slaves under the Imperial Japanese military before and during World War II.
The APALSA webinar comes after an academic paper by Harvard Law Professor of Japanese Legal Studies J. Mark Ramseyer stoked international controversy in recent weeks. In the paper, set to be printed by an academic journal, Ramseyer goes against the historical consensus by arguing that comfort women were voluntarily contracted to Japanese brothels. Due to mounting outcry at Harvard and beyond, the paper’s print publication has since been delayed by the journal and its contents are under review.
The Japanese Empire took sex slaves from its occupied territories, including from Korea, in the early 20th century. Estimates are disputed, but range from tens of thousands to up to 410,000. Since the war, many activists and former comfort women have argued the Japanese government has never fully reconciled with the issue.
In an interview on Friday, APALSA organizer and law student Janet Park said she wanted the event to enable viewers to learn directly from Lee, known worldwide as “Grandma Lee,” adding that comfort women survivors are “living proof of history.”
At a Tuesday morning press conference in Seoul, Lee requested the Korean and Japanese governments refer the comfort women issue to the International Court of Justice for resolution.
During the Tuesday evening panel, dressed in hanbok, traditional Korean clothing, Lee delivered an initial keynote, appealing to South Korean President Moon Jae-in to bring the comfort women issue up with Japan at the ICJ. Phyllis Kim, the executive director of American activist organization Comfort Women Action for Redress and Education, provided English translation for Lee.
On Jan. 8, a South Korean court found the Japanese government liable for crimes against a dozen comfort women, ordering an official apology and legal compensation. The administration of Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, according to Lee, continues to ignore and deny its responsibility for the issue.
“I don’t have a lot of time left,” Lee, who is 92, said during the webinar. “I hope President Moon can persuade Prime Minister Suga so that this issue can finally be resolved and we regain our honor and justice.”
“My wish is to go to ICJ and get a clear decision and judgment from ICJ so that the Japanese government and the people can learn what really happened and the correct history,” Lee added.
Estelita Dy, an activist and surviving comfort woman from the Philippines, was also slated to attend, but was ultimately unable to.
In 1999, Honda, the California representative who spoke at the webinar, introduced a resolution passed by Congress which urged the U.S. government to encourage Japan to acknowledge its historical responsibility and apologize to comfort women.
Honda said Tuesday that the Japanese government is taking that resolution and movement “very seriously,” spending beyond its national budget to shape the narrative around the issue.
In light of the controversy surrounding Ramseyer’s recent paper, Lee urged webinar attendees to “ignore” Ramseyer’s claims in the paper, which she called “absurd.”
She added, however, that Ramseyer’s paper may also be a “blessing in disguise.” Lee said his paper has become a “wake up call” to spread awareness about comfort women.
In response to statements made about his claims during the event, Ramseyer said he is putting together a “short package of material on this topic” to make available to colleagues and anyone else who may be interested.
Other panelists discussed misconceptions in the historical record surrounding comfort women, responding to claims made in Ramseyer’s paper and by others who have denied the significance of the issue.
Former San Francisco Superior Court judge Lillian K. Sing, a panelist, said that though recent calls for reparations have only involved Korea and Japan, the issue surrounding comfort women involves “all the countries Japan invaded between 1931 and 1945.”
“It’s a story of the brutal commodification of women,” she said. “We need to focus it on the issues of human rights, of economic disparity, exploitation of women, and also about what happens during military times of conflict — how women, especially, are victimized during this time.”
Sing said she hopes those who have argued against the historical consensus on the issue would understand that denying the stories of comfort women causes them grief.
“I hope Mr. Ramseyer is watching and listening and has the compassion to understand and feel the pain that Grandma Lee is going through,” she said.
Sing questioned the Japanese government’s position on the issue more broadly.
“Why don’t they just accept what happened and move on?” she asked.
Second-year law student Rosalind Liang, who moderated the event, asked the panelists on behalf of audience members how they should combat “Japanese propaganda" that promotes an inaccurate historical narrative.
Panelist and fellow retired San Francisco Superior Court judge Julie M. Tang emphasized said comfort women's testimonies must be preserved for posterity.
“What we’re going to be doing is to continue to support our grandmas,” Sing added. “In the last search for justice, we just won’t give up.”

While reading through the syllabus or surviving the first few classes, I’m sure we’ve had our fair share of eye rolls at rules. With Zoom as our new classroom, class norms can look a little different. Thus, some turn-offs are pandemic-specific, others are everlasting — haunting us both in-person and online. The important part is to figure out what you can handle before the add/drop period ends!
They start exactly on time.
I guess it’s wrong to assume there was an unspoken rule to begin class three to five minutes after its designated starttime. I swear I’ve logged on one minute after 12:00 p.m., and I’ve already missed the title slide of the powerpoint. Big no-no if you’re a get-up-5-minutes-before-class-typa-gal.
Required textbook with their name on it.
I really had to do a double-take when I saw that demand on the syllabus. Why should we pay $60 for this textbook when I KNOW you have copies at your house?! Literally, email it to us????
They call you out about your camera
Okay, I’m not a monster; I can understand why a professor would want everyone to have their camera on to recreate an authentic classroom setting. HOWEVER, why would you call out someone by name for not doing so??? I was just trying to fix my coffee, geez.
No late assignments
It’s one thing to have a grade penalty for late assignments, but it’s another to give ZERO credit. Sometimes, this is also made 10 times worse with the no extension-granting rule. It’s the lack of sympathy for me!
Cold-calling 
Yes, I saved the worst for last. And it feels like this atrocity happens at the worst moments. Why call on me when I’m definitely not making eye contact with the camera? Better yet, is that the reason they did it? Big red flag!
Remember, you have until Feb. 22 to not vibe in pain …. Or simply risk not vibing in another more accommodating class! Pick your battles!
