After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Much has been said on the international reactions — or lack thereof — to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Though prominent papers such as the New York Times and the Daily Telegraph ran stories detailing the massacre of millions of Jews, the reports were often sidelined, and public outcry remained limited. When London was told by Gerhard Riegner, a representative of the World Jewish Congress in Switzerland, that Hitler had ordered the extermination of European Jewry, the Foreign Office responded that an official British response “might annoy the Germans.” Government officials in Washington, D.C. similarly expressed suspicion with the supposedly “unsubstantiated nature of the information.” Not until reporters in 1945 described the already-liberated death camps did the severity of the Holocaust become apparent to Western audiences. And despite that, despite images and criminal trials and admittances and evidence upon evidence upon evidence, anti-Semitism and suspicions of over-exaggeration still persist today.
History is infamous for its ability to repeat itself. The emergence of large-scale “re-education” internment camps in Xinjiang Province of China, where reports estimate millions of Chinese Muslims have been extrajudicially detained, have similarly received little attention. Former detainees and Xinjiang residents have described beatings, electrocutions, sexual abuse, compulsory sterilization, and countless other violations of the Genocide Convention. Persecution in Xinjiang has not been limited to actual Chinese citizens, either. Mihrigul Tursun, traveling from Egypt, testified that she was detained, separated from her infant children (one of whom later died), and placed in a cell with sixty other women. Their shared toilet was recorded by security cameras. According to former national security adviser John Bolton, President Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that “[the camps] are exactly the right thing to do.”
In Belarus, months-long political demonstrations have called for the resignation of Alexander Lukashenko after a supposed land-slide victory of 80.2 percent in the presidential election. According to numerous publications and witnesses, thousands of protesters have faced arbitrary detainment and torture, with many still missing or facing imprisonment. Konstantin Shishmakov, a museum director who had refused to sign a falsified electoral protocol claiming that Lukashenko had won the election, disappeared only days after taking his stand. He was found a few weeks ago, hanged in a nearby forest; investigators claimed there was no evidence of a crime. Video footage published by the Associated Press similarly suggest that Alexander Taraikovsky, a protester whose death had been reported an accidental suicide by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was actually shot by policemen, empty-handed.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, described as “the man Vladimir Putin fears most,” has been in a coma after his doctors admitted that he had likely been poisoned through his tea at an airport on August 20. Recently, Navalny had claimed that the revolution occurring in Belarus would soon come to Russia. Meanwhile, conflicts from Libya to Syria to Sudan continue to rage, their stories passed over as old news. In Yemen, the civil war that has caused the deaths of over 80,000 children from starvation alone is only getting worse.
Despite internet communication making us connected with one another like never before, we are somehow less informed, less interested, and less concerned with the global state of foreign affairs than we have ever been. Protesters in Hong Kong, fighting for freedom from their oppressors in a way strikingly similar to that of our American forefathers, faced silence from the country whose empathy should have been strongest.
The lack of any significant involvement with contemporary foreign affairs by the American public is disappointing. For a people who believe themselves morally superior to the rest of the world, our willful ignorance and active disinterest in matters concerning human rights exudes selfishness and lack of basic human compassion. The prior summarization of ongoing events does not even begin to scratch the surface of the atrocities taking place every day across the world. However difficult, we must try to think not just of ourselves, but of the many whose stories are in danger of passing by unnoticed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The interval between undergradute move-in days and the first week of classes is usually filled with students bustling in Harvard Yard, friends reuniting over meals in the dining halls, and freshmen eagerly learning how to navigate campus.
This year, however, undergraduates who are living on campus spent most of this period sitting inside their dorm rooms during the College’s week-long mandatory quarantine period.
Orlee G. Marini-Rapoport ’23, a Crimson Editorial editor, said she spent the initial 24-hour phase of quarantine scrolling through Twitter and FaceTiming friends and family to stay busy. Despite being eager to leave her room, Marini-Rapoport said she understood that the quarantine was a necessary step to “keep the community safe.”
“I knew this would be difficult because last year I didn’t spend any time in my room. I would consider a day in my room to be really sad, since it’s not what I wanted to be doing in college,” Marini-Rapoport said. “But I think we need to have strict norms like this as a community to keep everyone safe. And not just for keeping students safe but for keeping staff members and the Cambridge community safe, too.”
Students invited to live in residence — freshmen and a limited group of upperclassmen — were required to sign a residential “community compact” that provided guidelines for living on campus. The compact mandates that students on campus consent to a two-phased, week-long quarantine period. The first phase commences upon arrival, when students are ushered to tents on the Science Center Plaza to take their first coronavirus test.
After moving in, students are required to remain in their suites for 24 hours as they await their test results. If a student tests negative, they are then permitted to enter the second phase of quarantine, during which they may pick up food from the dining halls, go to the mailroom, and go outside alone or in socially-distanced pairs.
Though permitted to navigate campus, each student must still undergo routine testing every two to three days for the next week. The second phase ends once the student receives their third negative test result.
In July, administrators announced that the College would only allow up to 40 percent of the student body to campus in the fall due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus. But as of August, administrators determined that only 25 percent of the student body would ultimately live on campus.
Lara Dada ’24 said she felt “a little intimidated” coming to campus for the first time but credits the kindness of other students for making her transition into college easier.
“I know a lot of people in my class are high-achieving and well-accomplished, and I was kind of nervous to see how that would translate into their personalities,” Dada said. “So far, every person I’ve met has been so kind and wonderful and open to talking. That’s made this whole process a lot better.”
Dada, who has completed both phases of quarantine, said she has managed to meet new people by striking up conversations with students in Harvard Yard and chatting with classmates over outdoor, socially-distanced meals.
Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21 said that, though he did not envision starting his senior year without most of the senior class on campus, he feels “grateful” for each moment he gets to spend at Harvard.
“It’s tough because the people I’ve built such close relationships with and who became literally a part of my family aren’t on campus with me to enjoy our last year here,” Kumar said.
“Getting kicked off campus in March was hard for me, but then I imagined the seniors who didn’t get to say their final goodbyes to their classmates and teachers,” he added. “That made me super grateful for the moments I’m getting to have on campus.”
Kumar added that his experience on campus has been “positive” so far due to the “upbeat environment” fostered by administrators and Mather House’s team of tutors and faculty deans.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, who was one of many administrators who personally welcomed students to campus, pointed to the “energy, enthusiasm, and excitement” felt on campus during the move-in period.
“So many people across the College and University, particularly the planning team, the College's residential staff, and First Year Experience office, have been working all summer to welcome students back,” O’Dair wrote in an email. “Greeting students and parents on the plaza, in the houses, and in the dorms was for many of us across Harvard the highlight of our year.”
“Our message to students is that we are so glad you are here, and that we will navigate the semester together," she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a limited number of students move into Harvard's dorms and others occupy apartments near campus, residents of the Greater Boston area are voicing concerns about the student population’s impact on their own health and safety.
Several colleges across the country have reported high numbers of coronavirus cases after welcoming students back to campus. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill sent most of its students home after reporting hundreds of positive tests, and multiple other schools have reported case counts over 1,000.
In July, Harvard announced it would open its dorms to the Class of 2024 and allow certain upperclassmen who petition to return for the fall semester. The FAS projected only 25 percent of the undergraduate population will live on campus for the fall, after setting a 40 percent limit.
In addition to the 25 percent returning to campus, other undergraduates are returning to Cambridge and Allston to live off-campus.
Cambridge City Councilor Marc C. McGovern said that the mass return of college students into the Greater Boston area — not just Harvard undergraduates — concerns him. He also said that although students may feel “invincible,” they still bear a responsibility for preventing an outbreak in the city.
“I know what it was like when I was, you know, 20 years old and in college and I didn't always exactly follow rules, I didn't always do the smart thing,” McGovern said. “Part of college is socializing and relationships, and so it's concerning.”
“Our college students are like everybody else,” he added. “There are plenty of college graduates and people my age that aren't taking it as seriously as they should. I'm sure that some college students will take it seriously and I'm sure some of them won’t.”
Cambridge resident David E. Sullivan said he has “mixed feelings” about students returning. On one hand, he said, the abundance of students contributes to the vitality of the city, but he is also worried about the level of adherence to public health policies, especially among the freshman class — which comprises the bulk of students returning to campus.

“I think everyone, probably, including the students themselves are very worried about, you know, spreading coronavirus,” he said. “Above all, don't party. I think a lot of students who are coming back are gonna be freshmen, and I think a lot of their attitude is going to be ‘hey, what's the point of going to college if I can't go to a party?”
Other residents have concerns specifically about the students living off-campus.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, said he hoped Boston-area universities, including Harvard, would formulate health and safety plans that account for students living both on-campus and off.
“I liked the fact that testing seems to be consistent across both on-campus and off and that's important,” he said. “I would have liked to have seen more colleges and universities provide self-isolation and quarantine facilities to off-campus students as well, instead of just saying, ‘Hey, you need to go home, or you can self-quarantine or isolate in your off-campus apartment with your other roommates.”
“That was a little bit too loosey goosey,” D’Isidoro added.
D’Isidoro also said Harvard’s residential life might demand different planning than other colleges with higher proportions of students living off-campus.
“Most of the undergrads at Harvard do stay on-campus, do live on-campus, so a little bit different than some of the others like BU and BC that tend to have a lot of undergrads living off-campus,” he said.
Not all local residents, however, are as worried. Eugenia B. Schraa ’04 — a Cambridge resident — said that she believes returning students understand the “serious” necessity of public health guidelines, and will be a much needed “boon” for the city.
“It's really not about people living in cities that’s dangerous, it's really about the practices, and the habits and the care that they take to prevent the disease,” Schraa said.
D’Isidoro said overall he thinks the University is making a serious effort to ensure off-campus students are held to similar health and safety standards.

“So far, so good, you know. Again, we're holding our breaths — we're encouraged that the colleges and universities are taking it very seriously with all students not just on-campus but off-campus,” D’Isidoro said. “They seem to be holding those students to the same protocols, the same accountability, and there’s a lot to be lost if students act in a bad way in the community.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that the University has consistently updated state and local leaders on its plans for the fall semester and implemented wide-scale testing, ensuring its plan is guided by “principles of health, safety, education and research.”
“A critical piece of the University’s plan is frequent COVID-19 screening through viral testing, beginning in June, for the entirety of the limited population of individuals authorized to be on campus,” O’Rourke wrote. “Additionally, as this limited number of students returned to campus last week, we also launched a public-facing dashboard, which is updated daily with the latest testing data and results as part of our continued commitment to awareness and transparency.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said businesses always think of the beginning of the semester as “New Year’s,” and that the reality of a less busy fall is “heartbreaking.”
“Just a completely different vibe,” she said. “So that's certainly disturbing and we understand it and we know that the universities are doing the right thing by thoughtfully and slowly welcoming students back, and keeping them on campus once they get here to the extent that that’s possible.”
As far as students not taking proper precautions, she added that Cambridge residents are not afraid to tell someone off for flouting social distancing rules.
“Even if kids come from other sections of the country that do not have as strict guidelines, I believe they will very quickly assimilate because they will be embarrassed not to,” she added. “As a Cambridge resident, and I’ve witnessed it myself, there's very few people who have any compunction about saying ‘hey, you're getting too close,’ or ‘hey, where's your mask?’ ”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A sublet in Somerville. A condo in Cambridge. An apartment in Allston. Denied the opportunity to live in Harvard dorms, some students at the College have returned to the Boston area on their own dime.
Harvard announced in July that it would hold all undergraduate courses online, welcoming freshmen — in addition to a select few upperclassmen — to spend the fall semester on campus, while taking classes from their dorm rooms. In a normal year, more than 90 percent of Harvard undergraduates live in on-campus housing.
Despite precipitous local real estate prices, a number of upperclassmen have chosen to take up residence in the Cambridge or Greater Boston area this fall. They say they hope living adjacent to Harvard will help them maintain the continuity of their College experience, facilitate socially distant meet-ups with friends, enable them to access library resources, and potentially allow them to resume work in local labs.
Although living off campus frees these students from the strict rules the College has put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19, administrators have urged them to act cautiously.
“Whether you are living on campus or elsewhere, I trust that you will take seriously the values that animate our learning and standards of student conduct that are outlined in the Handbook for Students,” Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a late August email to students.
“Wherever you are living, you are an ambassador and representative of our community, which is why our Harvard Community standards apply to all enrolled students,” he added.
Khurana urged undergraduates to pay particular attention to the public health guidelines in their area, including wearing masks, maintaining appropriate physical distance from others, and avoiding large gatherings.
While they won’t have access to most campus buildings, several students said living in Massachusetts will allow them to retain a “sense of normalcy.”
“It was really difficult to make the decision to leave home, but I'll be going to an environment with friends that's hopefully as closest to the college experience as possible,” said Nivedita Ravi ’21, who is living with three other Harvard students in Cambridge.
Michael Yin ’22, who found an apartment in Boston with four friends, said taking online classes at home prevented him from being as productive as possible.
“At home, I very much feel like I’m in a summer mode, so I thought moving to Boston might really help with that,” Yin said. “I just felt stagnant and I thought being able to live with friends for a while would be a really big help in terms of feeling like things are moving again.”
Racheal L. Lama ’23, who is living with a group of four other Harvard students in Central Square, also said she moved to Cambridge to create a more optimal atmosphere for remote learning.
“The environment here feels a lot better knowing that the people around us in Cambridge, the people on campus, are also students doing schoolwork,” she said. “All of us felt that like at home — or in our respective countries, wherever we were — because we weren't around other students, it was really difficult for us to focus in the spring.”
Lama added that the group had an extra incentive to set up shop near campus because Harvard’s library system has begun offering contactless book pick-up.
Kyle A. Mueller ’22, who is living in Boston’s financial district with a handful of Harvard friends, said that he and his roommates were similarly interested in availing themselves of campus resources.
He said the group, who are all science concentrators, hope their location will allow them to access Harvard’s labs — currently in a phased reopening process — should they open more broadly over the next several months.
Undergraduates also cited less studious reasons for returning to Massachusetts — namely, the chance to socialize. Mueller and Lama said they hope to perhaps see friends in the area while respecting public health guidance.
Nazeli Hagen ’21 — who is living with three fellow seniors in Cambridge — likewise said her group selected their location with the goal of socializing with nearby college students, while practicing rigorous social distancing.
“Cambridge, being close to campus, seemed like the best option — the highest probability that you would be around other college people, whether that be people living on campus or just other people who had the same idea,” she said.
Michael A. Fein ’22, who is living in a townhouse just across the street from Annenberg dining hall, said if he were a College administrator, he would be concerned about a large number of students choosing to live in the Cambridge area in the fall, given the convenience of congregating on campus.
He estimated that roughly 25 percent of the students he knows are either living near campus in the fall or planning on visiting this semester.
“I think that having mainly freshmen back on campus kind of saves them just because the number of interactions between sophomores, juniors, and seniors with freshmen that they haven't really met is probably lower,” Fein said.
He added that he and his housemates plan to take stringent safety precautions like wearing masks and following social distancing guidelines to ensure they don’t contract or spread COVID-19.
For both students and administrators, undergraduates flocking to nearby rentals is just one more challenge in an already unusual semester.
Hagen said she feels administrators will struggle to “police” the activity of students living in independent housing close to campus since, historically, the vast majority of Harvard’s student body has lived in on-campus dorms.
“Off-campus living is like part of the ecosystem at other schools, whereas at Harvard, it's not there at all,” she added. “And so I think that trying to build in that infrastructure would just be really, really difficult. “

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard begins its first all-online semester, the Arts and Humanities division is offering a new set of interdisciplinary courses designed to meet the needs of a virtual classroom.
The courses — ARTS 20: The Garden, HUMAN 20: A Colloquium in the Visual Arts, and HUMAN 90: Making It: A Sophomore Seminar in the Humanities — will be taught by faculty from a wide array of departments across FAS.
In describing the conception of HUMAN 90, Dean of the Arts and Humanities Division Robin E. Kelsey said the course seeks to bridge the gap between freshman year and upper-level courses within the division.
“This course was an effort to come up with a good answer to the question, ‘What’s next?’” Kelsey said. “What happens after the freshman year that enables a student to get a broader perspective on academic work in the humanities?”
Kelsey, who co-teaches HUMAN 90 with Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Suzannah Clark, explained the course will teach students how to critically engage with the arts and humanities.
Kelsey added the course was also inspired by a desire to “reinvigorate the humanities in this dynamic and challenging time.”
Similarly, History of Art and Architecture Professor Yukio M. Lippit ’92, who spearheaded the development of HUMAN 20, wrote in an email that the course will teach students “how to study works of visual art with rigor, to appreciate their infinite complexity and the questions onto which they open up.”
Lippit co-teaches HUMAN 20 this semester with fellow History of Art and Architecture faculty Joseph L. Koerner, Ewa Lajer-Burcharth, Sarah E. Lewis ’01, David J. Roxburgh, and Jennifer L. Roberts.
Lajer-Burcharth said the course — which she described as “structurally modeled” after HUMAN 10, an introductory-level humanities course — will be a special addition to the arts and humanities curriculum at Harvard because of its focus on “visual aspects of culture” and “visual literacy.”
Koerner acknowledged while the virtual semester will pose unique challenges, he believes that art history — which often relies on the use of a slide projector to “project objects that are in the museum into a classroom” — might benefit “from a world in which we are all sharing the same screen.”
“I’m excited to try out this format because it’s a format that can be, if handled well, a really interesting way of bringing people together by all of us talking together at the same time, around the same shared thing, which is this representation of an object on our screen,” Koerner said.
ARTS 20: The Garden will also pilot a new format this term. The course, which features faculty from the Arts, Film, and Visual Studies, Music, and Theater, Dance, and Media departments, intends to bring students of different arts disciplines together.
Speaking about the development of ARTS 20, AFVS professor Karthik Pandian said the course — a transdisciplinary collective of students and faculty — was designed to meet the needs of student-artists during this difficult time.
“[TDM professor] Jill [Johnson]’s dancers literally cannot be in the same room as one another,” Pandian said. “Folks that are trying to collaborate on thesis films can’t form a crew and make a film. So what do we need at this moment? We need more collective structures.”
Johnson, who serves as a mentor in ARTS 20 along with Pandian and Music professor Claire Chase, echoed Pandian’s sentiment, framing the course title as representative of the collaborative “model of care” the course will implement.
“We wanted to literally prepare the ground and start to seed, to set in motion, a community that we want to be central for student artists,” Johnson said. “It will be a time for students to do self paced work together with mentorship, which is central to the garden ecosystem.”
Chase echoed the garden metaphor, describing her aspirations for students to come out of the class with “incredibly fertile ground to do what what they need to do in their own artistic practices and in their activism for creating, shaping reimagining, breaking down, disrupting, rebuilding the worlds that they want to live in and work in.”

In three messages to Harvard affiliates Wednesday, University President Lawrence S. Bacow called on the community to heed public health measures and take care of one another ahead of the start of the fall semester.
As Harvard joins the ranks of universities nationwide with campus opening plans put to the test, the University is relying on its community compact and testing regimen to keep its positive case count low and its affiliates healthy.
At a service at Memorial Church on Wednesday, Bacow spoke about the importance and comfort of rituals, framing public health measures as “daily celebrations of life” that protect oneself and others.

“Waking at home instead of on campus, working at home instead of on campus; these are actually commitments to keeping members of our community safer than they would otherwise be,” Bacow said. “They are our new ritual.”

At Convocation on Tuesday, Bacow advised new students to bear in mind the responsibility of attending Harvard — a responsibility which he said starts “close to home.”

“Social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing: these actions may save your life, the life of someone close to you, the life of someone you’ll never meet,” he said. “In moments when compliance feels like a nuisance—and we’ve all been there—I hope you’ll remember the stakes and do the right thing.”

Beyond emphasizing that duty, Bacow encouraged the College’s newest students to register to vote, find and fight for causes they care about, and “try to right” wrongs they see in the world.

“This summer — just this week — the streets of cities across this country have been filled with protestors, demonstrations unlike any I have seen since I was your age,” Bacow said. “People are marching for justice.”

“They are marching against racism, and they are shining a light on systems and symbols in this country and elsewhere that perpetuate inequality,” he added. “That, too, is democracy in action — citizens exercising their rights to help right wrongs — people working together to form a more perfect union.”

The speech was indicative of an evolution in Bacow’s public rhetoric in response to the protests against systemic racism and police brutality that swept the nation this summer, from an email to affiliates on May 30 that focused on his “beliefs” in America’s values and the “goodness” of its people, which received criticism, to a direct statement that “Black lives matter” on June 10.

He also lauded anti-racist activism in an email to students on Wednesday.

“After George Floyd was killed and in the midst of stunning protests, you told powerful and personal stories about the experience of being Black in America,” he wrote. “You called on Harvard to fight racism and denounce white supremacy—important work that has only grown in urgency since the shooting of Jacob Blake.”

At the close of his email, Bacow admitted the unknowns of the “semester unlike any other” — and the possibility of both success and failure.

“When we get it right, we will celebrate. When we get it wrong, we will commiserate—and try again,” he wrote. “The truth is that none of us knows what lies ahead, but we face this uncertainty together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Homeless shelters in Cambridge are grappling with their fall and winter operations as the coronavirus pandemic continues to take a toll in Massachusetts.
Shelters that rely on undergraduate volunteers, such as the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter and Y2Y, are forced to contend with the lack of college students on campus. Other Cambridge shelters are working to provide COVID testing and a safe place for people to shelter during the pandemic despite limits on their capacities.
Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, located in University Lutheran Church, will not open as usual starting in November. Staffed entirely by undergraduate volunteers, the shelter closed in March after the University forced students to move out of on-campus housing.
“The pandemic has created enormous challenges for us, because of our space constraints and our student-run model,” HSHS Administrative Directors Matthew M. Jelen ’21 and Alicia Liu ’22 said in an email.
Prior to the pandemic, HSHS served as an emergency overnight shelter between November and April, with 24 beds lotteried off to people for anywhere from one night to two weeks. The shelter also provided hot meals and other resources, with around 200 people accessing its services each season.
While the shelter will not open as scheduled, HSHS staff is still looking for “new ways to provide resources and services,” per the emailed statement. Jelen and Liu wrote that they are working with University Lutheran Church and a Space Renovations Specialist “to enhance and rework the physical space for safe social distancing” for their eventual reopening.
Y2Y — another student-run shelter — has been able to operate at reduced capacity through the year and plans to continue providing shelter to 22 guests this fall, according Y2Y Staff Directors Shea Hausman ’22 and Cecilia R. D’Arms ’21, a former Crimson news writer.
In the past, the shelter closed from April to June and August to October, but it will remain open through this year to address the needs of those experiencing homelessness during the pandemic.
Paid professional staff currently fill most of Y2Y’s positions, assisting in cleaning, meal, and laundry services, per the emailed statement. A limited number of students in the Boston area will work as volunteers in the fall and winter season.
“The shelter will be operating continuously until our typical season end date in April under a hybrid model with experienced students from Harvard living off-campus volunteering with Y2Y Network under the Harvard Serves Everywhere initiative,” Hausman and D’Arms wrote.
Meanwhile, Y2Y will continue to accept clothing, food, and monetary donations through its website.
Non-Harvard affiliated shelters in Cambridge also face their own challenges in the coming months as they hope to safely house homeless individuals during a pandemic that has exacerbated the housing crisis in Massachusetts.
Located on the corner of Garden and Mason Street in Cambridge, First Church Shelter shifted its operations from an overnight to a 24/7 shelter at the end of March. After housing 14 people during the early months of the pandemic, First Church staff are currently piecing together a plan to continue operating their always-open shelter past the end of September.
“It’s all month to month. We know we’re good till the end of September,” the shelter’s director Jim Stewart said.
Since 1987, the church has offered shelter on a “referral basis,” where people in need are identified by other resource groups and organizations helping the homeless, Stewart said. The church has worked with the Cambridge Health Alliance and Pro EMS to provide guests access to COVID-19 tests, which take place on-site every Wednesday from 4 to 6 p.m.
The Cambridge And Somerville Programs for Addiction Recovery operates a shelter at 240 Albany Street that used to house 103 people every night. Now, CASPAR has limited its capacity to 50.
The shelter's decrease in capacity came after 13 of its guests tested positive for coronavirus in the spring, according to Nancy Mahan, Senior Vice President for Bay Cove Human Services.
Bay Cove Human Services, which manages CASPAR, is working with the City of Cambridge to make other shelter space available in order to “de-congregate" the 240 Albany Street shelter, Mahan said. She added that “many people” are choosing not to stay in shelters to avoid contracting the virus.
“In meeting with some men and women who experience homelessness at some of the test sites, several of them said that ‘we don’t want to be near a shelter right now,’” Mahan said.
Like First Church, CASPAR is also working to provide COVID testing to people in need of tests.
The Salvation Army Shelter at 402 Massachusetts Avenue remains in operation to house 19 people, a decrease from its normal capacity of 35.
“There are certainly people more visible on the streets than ever before,” Salvation Army Shelter systems administrator Leonard Oreto said. “And there’s limits to how many people can be kept overnight.”
The shelter anticipates needing more volunteers this winter. Karen Meehan, director of operations at the Salvation Army shelter, said she was concerned about how the shelter will continue to accomodate more people during the cold weather.
“We’ll have to make do, but we’re gonna need help on that,” Meehan said.

While a virtual semester comes with many perks (waking up mere minutes before a 9 a.m. and still making it to class on time never gets old), making new friends definitely poses a new challenge. Without social community spaces other than your local laundry room, when it comes to socializing, you may need to get creative. Here are Flyby’s tips to making friends: Zoom Edition — because a virtual semester doesn’t need to be a lonely semester.
Run a Background Check
Level 1: Let Them Come to You
The first step to figuring out who’s worth befriending is to run some background checks! While you can no longer gauge and convey common interests and identities through thorough laptop stickers, this is where Zoom’s background functionality comes into play. Too shy to slide into someone’s Zoom messages? Personalize your Zoom background, and, if you’re lucky, it won’t be long before you ignite a conversation over your shared interest. Let the bonding commence!
Breakout of Your Comfort Zone 
Level 2: Meet Them Halfway
Looking for a more organic connection? Let the Zoom deities and/or your professor work their magic by assigning you into a breakout room where you can test for yourself whether or not your partner passes the vibe check. Before delving into the social theory of gift-giving, take the opportunity to break out of your comfort zone and give the gift of an icebreaker or compliment!
Do the Most by Being a Host 
Level 3: Go the Full Nine Yards
Zoom classes just not doing it for you? Plan a game night or speed friending night with classmates or people you’d like to know better! Zoom’s randomized breakout rooms are perfect for pairing people up, and you can find great icebreaker questions online. Once the ice is broken, skribbl.io and drawphone are great ways to kick off a fun game night!
But remember, Zoom fatigue is a real thing, so ~tech~ a break every once in a while and go on a nice walk. Who knows — maybe you’ll even meet a friend out in the wild (socially distanced, of course).
