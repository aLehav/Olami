After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every year, like a distorted New Year’s resolution with none of the cake or confetti, I compare myself to a dreamscape version of myself. Dream Christina has a nice singing voice and kind eyes. Dream Christina knows how to keep a conversation going. They are the kind of cool that makes people want to stop them on the street and ask where they got their fit.
In reality, I have an okay singing voice, okay eyes, an okay ability at facilitating conversation, an okay sense of style. In reality, I have no fewer than six different documents listing life goals, action items for the semester, bucket lists, skills to learn, things about myself to fix, and ambitions so deep they’re almost shameful.
I want to change. I want to grow and blossom and flower. I want to be a better person, whatever that means to me at the moment.
Don’t we all? The drive for self-improvement is embedded within Harvard’s culture. We are overachievers always striving for perfection. We believe we are capable of great things, as long as we put in the work. I watch my friends and peers reshape themselves into the people they want to be. They Pavlov themselves into going to office hours. They print out affirmations to stick above their beds. I have joint semesterly goal lists with some of these people, for accountability.
So we are budding and changing altogether. But we treat self-improvement as if we are reforming ourselves, like a collapsed piece of pottery that must be thrown into an amorphous lump of clay before it can be turned into something beautiful again. We say things like, “God, I can’t believe I was ever that awkward” or “I used to be so stupid.” We think we need to be cruel to our past selves, lest we slip back into their comfortable skins. There’s a disconnect between us now — well-adjusted and self-assured — and us then — bumbling, terrified, anxious.
In astrology — yes, that astrology — there is no distinction between now and then. You, in the astrological sense, are three signs nested like Matryoshka dolls: Moon, Sun, Rising.
Your Moon is your innermost emotional self. It’s the bumbling, terrified, anxious child you try so hard to hide. Other people glimpsing your Moon is such a mortifying ordeal. You’d rather everyone see your Rising: the sign on the horizon at your birth, how you appear to strangers, the most polished version of you.
Your Sun, then, is the sign caught between these extremes of the intimately personal and the affably perceptible. It’s the tension between the inherent Moon of you and the intended Rising of you. The Sun sign is the only sign that’s really embedded within our cultural zeitgeist (it’s the one people mean when they ask, “What’s your sign?”), and for good reason — it’s the essence of you, at the center of the tug-of-war that constitutes your identity.
As the Sun, you are not one person trying to be another person, unlike how we think of self-improvement at Harvard. That other, better person, the Rising whom you so desperately want to be, is already inside of you, coexisting with the person you are now: the Moon whom you so desperately hate. You are not multiple disjointed people, each at discrete steps of growth; you are a singular eternal self continually striving, through layers of Moon, Sun, and Rising. You can split yourself into pieces to represent each period of your life, but it’s always just you.
Understanding yourself and your self-improvement journey as astrology does help you approach self-improvement with kindness, instead of harsh criticism and reproach of the past. Yes, you were once more awkward or less smart, your Moon overdeveloped and crowding out any sight of a Rising. But that was still you, and there’s nothing wrong with how you used to be. You could not be who you are now without who you used to be. You cannot be who you want to be in the future without who you are now. Your Moon, Sun, and Rising all build on each other.
At every stage of your life, you are exactly as you are supposed to be, written in the stars. And yet, in all our charts, there’s room for growth mapped out. The snapshot of the sky when you were born contains fixed, fated stars, and also swathes of empty space. Your past is fixed in the Moon; your striving in the Sun; your dreams in the Rising peeking over the horizon. But the path of self-improvement between these snapshots of you is loose with stardust. You can choose, mapping out your own constellations leapfrogging through the sky. Sun, Moon, Rising, sky of stars and void. It’s all you, and all yours for the taking.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 17, the U.S. military admitted what had become clear to everyone in the preceding days, thanks to heroic investigative journalism by New York Times reporters. The U.S. drone strike on Aug. 29 that was first announced as successfully targeting ISIS had actually killed an Afghan aid worker and nine other innocent civilians, including seven children.
The drone hit when the aid worker — Zemari Ahmadi — returned home, and his children were rushing to greet him in his car. The car was not speeding toward the airport where the U.S. military felt there was a threat, so it is difficult to see why the military deemed the situation so urgent that it called for a strike then and there in a residential district of Kabul. It is natural to conclude that the military, perhaps prodded by a hard-pressed administration, wanted to project power after the Kabul airport bombing on Aug. 26. Therefore they decided, based on seriously flawed intelligence, to launch a drone strike on a suspect, with callous disregard for the lives of civilian Afghans who would die in such a strike in a city of 4.6 million inhabitants.
Three years ago, another airstrike in Afghanistan wiped out the family of Masih Ur-Rahman Mubaraz, including his wife Amina, their seven children, and four relatives. It took the tenacious efforts of the Bureau for Investigative Journalism and the New York Times to establish — against initial Pentagon stonewalling and denials — that the strike had taken place and that it had killed an innocent woman and eleven children aged four to 16.
These are far from isolated incidents. According to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, the U.S. launched more than 14,000 drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen in the past 10 years. The death toll is estimated to be somewhere between nearly 8,900 and 16,900 people, of which roughly 10 percent are civilian casualties. Airwars, a London-based, nonprofit organization that attempts to track casualties of airstrikes more generally (and not just drone strikes), estimates that more than 22,000 innocent civilians have been killed by U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen since 2001.
The total number of deaths resulting from the U.S. invasion and botched “nation-building” effort in Afghanistan has been estimated by the Costs of War Project at Brown University to be 176,000, of which over 46,000 are Afghan civilians. Another 24,000 civilians have died from the spill-over of the Afghan war into Pakistan.
Last year, decent humans throughout the world were horrified by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police. Demonstrators took to the streets, and many public figures — including Harvard’s leadership — issued public statements denouncing the killing. The policemen responsible were charged and convicted. Is it too much to hope that similar scrutiny and accountability be extended toward the all-too-common cases of U.S. military actions leading to the deaths of innocent civilians in the Middle East?
America is a democracy; its citizens are therefore morally complicit when they know of crimes and atrocities committed by their government and army and nevertheless choose to shrug their shoulders and do nothing. Americans have a duty to speak out and — more importantly — bring those who are responsible to justice. Harvard’s voice here is essential, both as a leading educational and cultural institution in the country and as the alma mater of many leading figures in current and recent administrations.
The drone incident should be condemned and investigated precisely as if it had killed 10 innocent American civilians, including seven children. It is not enough that the military conducts its own internal investigation of the recent drone massacre. There should be an independent, bipartisan commission whose task is to find out precisely what happened, who was responsible for the intelligence and for the decision to strike, and if there was any political pressure on the army to act after the airport bombing.
Those who killed Zemari Ahmadi, Amina Mubaraz, and their families have as little right to remain anonymous or evade justice as those who killed George Floyd.
Afghan Lives Matter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the Charles River Watershed Association held a forum discussing the potential environmental repercussions of Harvard’s new Enterprise Research Campus on Allston and the Charles River. While the ERC itself earned high marks for its comprehensive, “above and beyond” approach to flood reduction, a newer Harvard investment on the Allston side of the river didn’t fare quite as well: Some Allston residents remain unconvinced by the North Allston Storm Drain Expansion Project.
We heartily support the project’s ambitions — it is a smart, timely investment that will help keep Allston safe and dry. The $50 million radical infrastructure revamp would be fully financed by Harvard and owned and operated by the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. It promises to slice flood volume by more than half, installing a new “trunk drain system” and expanding the diameter of the current pipe. It’s a chance to safeguard our community from the impacts of increasingly aggressive weather patterns caused by climate change: Much of North Allston lies in a future flood zone.
The NASDEP is a generous offer, especially because it is not clearly Harvard’s responsibility to fund infrastructure projects that keep Allston above water.
Together with Harvard’s impressive investments in sustainability with the ERC and Science and Engineering Complex, the NASDEP represents an auspicious new chapter in our University’s climate policy. We’ve already lauded the University’s quietly announced decision to divest from fossil fuels, and are excited to see our institution continue to materialize its stated climate ambitions.
Yet the storm drain expansion project’s future remains uncertain, and its execution, particularly when it comes to local outreach, has been remarkably unimpressive.
In fact, despite the project’s commendable goals, and despite our own desire to keep our campus safely above the Charles, we sympathize with Allston residents’ misgivings. Our administration has crafted an unnecessarily rough path to the regulatory green light. The entire project is contingent on the approval of the same local legislators who believe their constituents have been ignored by our institution. Some, like State Representative Michael J. Moran and State Senator Sal N. DiDomenico, have already refused to even consider endorsing the new drainage systems until Harvard remedies its lackluster outreach regarding the drain pipe expansion. Substantive engagement with the community we aim to literally uproot (if only to expand drain pipes) is the mark of a good steward; its absence is understandably upsetting.
Still, it would be regrettable if poor communication tanked an otherwise worthwhile enterprise. From both a climate and a good-neighborly perspective, Harvard and its critics must find middle ground: The Allston pipeline should be expanded, but not without community input. With massive Harvard-sized funding comes massive Harvard-specific responsibility.
Harvard should make sure to host multiple information sessions and forums for Allston’s community members, delineating the construction plan for the project and articulating why the pipe expansion is necessary in the first place. The information dissemination surrounding the SEC offers a good template to follow; the fact that the development consists of more pure infrastructure and fewer human spaces (like the SEC’s cafe or Micromarket) doesn’t mean social input isn’t vital.
Such sessions would allow the University to inform Allston’s residents about the new buildings’ environmental foot print while clarifying why additional construction is needed and getting invaluable local insight. Anyone impacted by the new construction, regardless of their specific association to the Charles River or Allston, should be invited to attend. That way, many community members, from those fearful of the environmental side-effects to those who believe the pipeline expansion plan has not gone far enough, would be given a chance to express their concerns.
We are confident that, after such engagement, Harvard will earn the necessary bureaucratic approval from State Rep. Michael J. Moran and State Sen. Sal N. DiDomenico. After all, the expansion is a remarkable example of our institutional willingness to take initiative when it comes to mitigating climate change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nine candidates for Cambridge City Council addressed how they would tackle affordable housing — a likely high-profile campaign issue ahead of this November’s election — at a candidate forum Sunday.
The candidates gathered in the Cambridge Community Center for a discussion organized and moderated by Project Right to Housing — an activist group that formed to push local elected officials to pass guaranteed housing legislation.
Several candidates said much of the challenge comes from the city experiencing rising rent prices and decreased affordable housing opinions — a trend shared by surrounding cities.
Burhan Azeem — a recent MIT graduate and second-time candidate — shared his personal struggles with housing affordability. After immigrating to the United States from Pakistan, Azeem said he and his family could not afford a house of their own.
“We had another family that was kind enough to let us live with them for a year,” Azeem said, but his family faced housing instability and was forced to move annually.
The event’s moderator asked the candidates if they thought housing should be guaranteed to all residents regardless of “income, substance use, mental health, legal history, or other factors” that might limit access to housing.
The candidates unanimously agreed that housing is a human right, and pledged to increase affordable housing units in the city if elected. Councilor E. Denise Simmons touted her work during her last nine terms on the council.
“I have worked to make sure that everyone and anyone who wants to decide to live in Cambridge can do that,” Simmons said.
Affordable housing also dominated the council elections in 2019, when the issue became a flashpoint for candidates, especially over the affordable housing overlay. In the end, a supermajority of candidates supporting that measure were elected to the council in November 2019. Eventually, the council passed the AHO the following year.
Much of Sunday’s discussion focused on each candidate’s plan to make housing more affordable. Though they agreed on the necessity of housing, the candidates put forward differing policy ideas.
Candidates Tonia D. Hicks, Nicola A. Williams, and Robert Eckstut argued public lands should be converted to affordable housing units.
“Cambridge has an excess, so public funds should be used and public land should be used to build housing for everyone,” Hicks said.
Williams noted other places such as parking lots and open lands could also be utilized for additional housing units.
Other candidates said they are focused on reforming the private market, including passing rent control, mandating affordable housing developments, and coordinating with surrounding cities to reform the housing market.
The candidates also debated about how to support unhoused residents. One member of the audience, who identified as queer, asked the candidates what they would do to help Cambridge’s unhoused BGLTQ population and said they were frustrated by limited shelter services.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since students have returned to campus, long lines, reduced hours, and staff shortages have plagued Harvard Square eateries, mirroring broader trends in the restaurant industry caused by the pandemic.
Amid a national shortage in restaurant workers, Harvard Square businesses have been inundated with customers, causing stores to reduce their hours and discontinue online ordering as lines stretch out of their doors.
“Help wanted” signs adorn Harvard Square storefronts including Black Sheep Bagel Cafe, Clover Food Lab, Dig, The Hourly Oyster House, Insomnia Cookies, Kung Fu Tea, Playa Bowls, Russell House Tavern, Tatte Bakery & Cafe, and Topdrawer.
Despite posting roughly 1 million job openings this March, the U.S. restaurant industry had 1.7 million fewer jobs filled in May than before the pandemic, per The Washington Post.
Mr. Bartley’s Burger Cottage owner Joshua S. Huggard said he has struggled to hire new employees. After unsuccessful job postings on Indeed.com, he said he has resorted to relying on walk-ins.
“The biggest thing with being short-staffed is you don’t want to lose the integrity of your brand and jeopardize service and quality. It can be tough sometimes, especially with impatient guests that come in,” Huggard said.
Some of the longest lines in Harvard Square over the past month have beset the popular Harvard Square eatery Tatte Bakery & Cafe.
Tatte spokesperson Diana C. Pisciotta wrote in an email that the store has significantly scaled back its hours — the cafe now closes at 4 p.m. instead of 9 p.m. — to allow its managers “additional time for recruiting, on-boarding, and training.”
“The restaurant industry, like many others, is facing an uphill climb: workforce shortages, supply chain disruptions, increased costs, and Covid,” she wrote.
Annina C. Kennedy-Yoon ’20, a barista at Darwin’s Ltd. who is involved in efforts to unionize employees at the coffee chain, said that staff turnover has been a persistent challenge at Darwin’s.
“There’s huge turnover in the food service industry, so that just makes it really difficult,” she said. “We keep getting new people who maybe will stay with us for a month, and so you train them for let’s say a week and a half, and they work until the end of the month, and then we have to find a new person.”
Kennedy-Yoon added that Darwin’s is “constantly short-staffed.”
“It’s difficult to be in a position where every minute of when you’re clocked in, you’re just constantly going, going, going,” she said.
Jonathan F. Belton, the Boston district manager at Topdrawer, a “lifestyle accessory” store with a location in Harvard Square, said that though the business also experienced staff shortages, he was able to keep some staff on board by prioritizing their safety.
“The thing that kept me staffed this year was to create an environment that was safe for everyone, an environment where people felt comfortable to come to work and be safe in Covid conditions,” he said.
Some students said they have noticed insufficient staffing and long wait times while trying to get a bite off campus.
Long lines at Tatte have discouraged Katherin T. Vasquez Sanchez ’25 from frequenting the establishment.
“I usually love going there, but I stopped going, because the lines were so long and I have classes in the morning,” she said. “I’d say the wait time is probably anywhere from 20 minutes to half an hour.”
Nahla C. Owens ’25 said she noticed that businesses like Insomnia Cookies and Kung Fu Tea — both of which are looking for new employees — are frequently packed with customers in the evening.
“One person is responsible for taking people’s orders, putting together ice cream, and grabbing cookies,” she said of Insomnia.
Owens said she empathizes with overstretched employees who are struggling to satisfy customers’ demands.
“It is sad to go in and see only one or two staff members, specifically at Kung Fu Tea, struggling to make drinks, especially when there’s a line out the door of students,” Owens added. “I can imagine that might be stressful for them.”

As ice sheets melt in Greenland and the Antarctic, the water that is generated shifts the planet’s crust on a global scale, reveals a new theoretical model by a researcher who recently completed her Ph.D at Harvard.
Sophie L. Coulson, who received her doctorate in Earth and Planetary Sciences in May, and other researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where she is now a fellow, published their findings in the peer-reviewed journal Geophysical Research Letters last month.
As a result of climate change, the global melting rate has starkly increased over the past two decades. Motion in the planet’s crust as a result of such meltage has been previously observed on a regional scale, directly beneath ice masses.
By analyzing satellite data from 2003 to 2018 to measure the crust’s shift, Coulson and her group predicted that the impact occurs at the global level.
“People have spent a lot of time focusing on the area directly around and beneath the ice sheet so it’s been known for a long time that beneath Antarctica and beneath Greenland, you have these significant 3D motions,” Coulson said in an interview. “I don’t think people were necessarily aware that these things are occurring thousands of kilometers away from the centers of ice melt.”
Melting ice causes multiple processes that generate the complex 3D motion at Earth’s surface, Coulson said.
First, the water from the ice sheet is moved into the global ocean, increasing the sea level. Meltage also reduces the mass of the ice and the load on the crust below the ice sheet, causing it to rebound, which shifts the surrounding crust, she explained.
Finally, there is a gravitational effect. As the ice sheet loses mass, the gravitational attraction that pulls water toward it is reduced, leading to a “counterintuitive” decrease in sea level near the ice sheet that has just melted.
Coulson said that this research has implications for GPS measurements, which are used widely to monitor things such as large scale tectonic activity, earthquakes, and volcanoes.
“People had already been doing a correction for this ice sheet loading process nearby, but in places like the continental U.S., they didn’t necessarily realize that they needed to be correcting for that signal,” Coulson said. “We need to look back at those previous studies that use these GPS measurements and make sure we have a correction in there.”
For Coulson and her research group at Los Alamos, the next steps are to empirically confirm the theoretical model’s predictions.
“We want to look at the data and say, ‘Okay, so we’ve predicted these signals, can we actually find them in this data that we’re analyzing?’” Coulson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 40th Harvard College Undergraduate Council convened for the first time Sunday to pass legislation to establish a new Select Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, fund a partnership with BlueBikes, and reintroduce its book fund.
The first legislative goal — establishing the Select Committee — involved two votes: one to introduce a constitutional amendment and the other to adjust the UC bylaws to make way for the new committee.
“There is a need for institutionalized equity and inclusion focuses in all committees considering the massive social action focus of student organizations across campus,” the amendment reads.
The amendment will add a new Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Chair to the executive board, while the bylaws will grant voting power to the new role on the executive board.
Each standing committee will select a delegate to serve on the new committee alongside one to three additional nominated members from the UC. Like other UC committees, the new committee will rely on majority rule to determine actions it takes.
“The Committee shall spearhead initiatives to assess and further belonging and inclusion on Harvard’s campus and within the Council,” the amended bylaws read.
The constitutional amendment, which passed by a vote of 41-0-5, was sponsored by President Noah A. Harris ’22, Secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, and Director of Belonging and Inclusion Tarina K. Ahuja ’24. Those UC members also sponsored the bylaws amendment.
The second legislation provides funding for undergraduates to obtain memberships to BlueBikes to ease commuting between the new Science and Engineering Complex, the Quad, and other parts of the campus.
The legislation has two main components: “Free BlueBike Day” and an annual membership. For the Free BlueBike Day, the UC has allocated $1,500 to provide free bikes to 300 students on October 9. As part of the initiative, the Harvard Transportation and Parking Department is covering half of the funding for the bikes.
The second part of the legislation is the annual subsidized BlueBikes membership that the UC is offering to 100 students. For this program, the UC has allocated $4,000 and will award the membership through a lottery system, giving priority to students who live relatively far from the Yard.
Students interested in either of these initiatives need to submit a form to be considered.
This legislation was sponsored by Harris and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22.
The third piece of legislation establishes a book fund to reimburse students who have spent their own money to buy textbooks and other academic materials.
The book fund was first introduced last spring and received more than 1,000 applications from students.
The legislation will reimburse 100 students for up to $50 with a total allocation of $5,000 for the fund. If interest for the fund does not exceed the total allocated amount, students who have spent more than $50 on school materials will be reimbursed for that sum.
Students who are on financial aid will receive priority for the disbursement of the fund.
The legislation was also sponsored by Harris and Gan.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences appointed a task force to reexamine the plans it announced in June to vacate the historic Pierce Hall and consolidate its Cambridge footprint, with some faculty pushing back on the proposed move.
Despite the opening of the new $1 billion SEAS complex in Allston, SEAS still maintains a presence on the north side of the Charles River, currently in both Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory and Pierce Hall. It has been considering plans, however, to downsize its Cambridge presence.
Totaling nearly 99,000 square feet, Pierce Hall was built in 1901 and has housed the SEAS administration since its inception.
Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory — a 97,500-square-foot building next door on Oxford Street — was built in 1999 following a $25 million donation to Harvard’s computer science and electrical engineering programs from two Microsoft executives, Chairman Bill Gates and President Steven A. Ballmer ’77, $20 million of which was used to construct Maxwell Dworkin in 1999.
As the SEAS complex neared opening, the school initially informed faculty it planned to stay in Pierce and return Maxwell Dworkin to the central Harvard administration, according to environmental engineering professor Daniel J. Jacob, who currently occupies an office on the first floor of Pierce Hall.
“But it turns out that reconfiguring the space would be very expensive because Pierce is so far from current code,” he said.
Following a cost-benefit analysis commissioned by SEAS, the school determined that rearranging Maxwell Dworkin would be a “much lower-cost option” than “undertaking a major renovation” of Pierce, SEAS dean Francis J. “Frank” Doyle III wrote in a June 15 email to SEAS faculty and staff.
“Given that the most important elements of the Cambridge campus plan can be realized using Maxwell Dworkin, with much less renewal expenses in infrastructure and code upgrades, we have decided to move in this direction,” Doyle wrote.
Doyle acknowledged that the new plan was a “significant change to our previously communicated plans,” but maintained that Maxwell Dworkin would be the optimal choice.
“[Maxwell Dworkin] has more classroom and seminar space, better community and large-group meeting spaces and better ventilation,” Doyle wrote. “Because it requires less work and is mostly empty, it can be renewed faster.”
In the email, he acknowledged the “downside” to the change: Maxwell Dworkin has less square footage than Pierce, and SEAS will lose Pierce 301, a large flat classroom.
Doyle also noted it was unclear what Pierce Hall would be repurposed for when not in use by SEAS.
Electrical Engineering professor Marko Lončar said Doyle’s update “caught a lot of faculty by surprise.”
“Others also have expressed disagreement with the way this decision has been made basically without faculty being consulted,” he said.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff declined to comment on faculty criticism of the school’s plans.
With some faculty questioning the June proposal, SEAS formed an internal task force in late summer to review all current plans and reexamine the study calculating renovation costs for Pierce Hall, according to Jacob and Physics professor David A. Weitz.
Jacob, who is on the committee, said the group was tasked with coming up with a new recommendation approximately by the end of October, noting that “we don’t know that we’re moving” and that “things are still up in the air.”
“Taking cost alone into account, it does appear Maxwell Dworkin maybe is less expensive, though the cost of moving to Maxwell Dworkin has not been very carefully understood, at least not at the same level of detail as renovating Pierce,” Lončar added.
Weitz, who worked in Pierce while receiving his Ph.D. and has had his office there for over 20 years, said it was pushback from faculty members that forced SEAS to form the new committee. Weitz said he believes consolidating in Maxwell Dworkin would “piss a lot of people off.”
Weitz challenged the notion that Pierce needs to be completely renovated, arguing it only needs to be “operational, functional.”
“They gave us a song and dance about how it costs too much to fix this place, but that’s to renovate this place to make it into a new building,” Weitz said. “Do we have to do that? No.”
Lončar and Weitz, who also serve on the committee, highlighted the historical significance of Pierce Hall as an argument in favor of retaining it.
“A lot of great accomplishments have been made in that building, so a fair amount of faculty prefer to stay in Pierce,” Lončar said.
Weitz added Pierce Hall is where SEAS has its roots as a school.
“If you believe that the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is important to Harvard, this is where it was born, this is where it lived,” Weitz said.

With promises of fall sweaters and pumpkin-flavored everything, the leaves outside are starting to turn a brilliant red and orange. Unfortunately, the leaves on our indoor plants have also decided to change. We are less excited about this. Spoiler alert — bamboo should not turn red, brown, or orange. In search of help, we turned to the experts for tips and tricks on plant care and ownership. Whether you’re looking to buy a new plant or keep your existing plants healthy, hopefully this list helps your babies grow and thrive!
Lucky Bamboo
Lucky Bamboo is – as we were told by the nice man at the PBHA plant sale – one of the easiest plants to take care of! It can be trained into different designs and swirls and symbolizes good luck and happiness. Some common care tips recommend that the bamboo is potted in rocks and watered pretty frequently, so that it never really dries out. Experts suggest that you remove the water every 7-10 days and replace it with fresh water. This plant prefers indirect sunlight and is an ideal houseplant.
Pothos
Next up is Pothos, another houseplant that is supposedly great for beginners! These plants are fairly flexible in terms of sunlight, but it is recommended to keep them in either indirect or low light. People grow Pothos either in soil or water and clippings can be taken and propagated, meaning instant new plants! Woohoo! Water your Pothos when the top soil starts to dry out, but be careful not to overwater it and make sure that the pot has good drainage.
Coffee Plant
Don’t buy a coffee plant or any tropical foliage unless you’re committed to being a full-time plant mom. They’re sensitive – to light, to water, and to your insults. If you try to grow a tropical plant in Cambridge-fall weather, it will die. And then you’ll have to plan a funeral as you toss the dry bundle of leaves into your basement dumpster and wonder where your plant parenting strategy failed (totally not speaking from experience here).
Orchids
Orchids are flowering plants – they’re pretty and add color to your room, but require a lot of effort to take care of. The best advice for keeping your orchid healthy is putting it in a windowsill that faces either east or west for bright light and feeding it every week with flower food. Orchids don’t grow well in regular soil — you’ll typically find them growing in a mixture of small rocks and bits of wood called orchid mix. If the plant stops flowering, it’s a sign that you need to repot your orchid in fresh orchid mix! Orchids prefer dry soil, so water them sparingly. Try just putting an ice cube in the soil to melt every other week or so.
Bonsai Tree
Bonsai trees are cute tiny trees that look super cool. But they are a little more temperamental than some aforementioned plants. That being said, if you are up to the challenge of raising a Bonsai tree, there are a few things you should know. Typically, Bonsai trees should be placed on the windowsill of a south-facing window, but realistically the most important thing is that it gets a lot of light. The tree also requires high humidity, but that should not be a problem here considering our recent weather. You should water your tree when the soil becomes slightly dry and pay close attention to the state of the soil.
Succulents
When life succs, buy one. A succulent will forgive you even if you forget to water it or forget it exists all together (not that you should). Among the most resistant and resilient of plants, succulents like bright light and dry soil that is well-drained (continuously wet soil can rot their roots). Spray your succulent with water every 2-4 days or let it soak up water in a different container every few weeks and dry out over time. You really can’t mess this one up. If you do, give up and buy a pet rock, dude.
Are we qualified to give you advice on plant care? Unclear (No). Should you listen to us anyway? Definitely. Expert or not, one thing we know for sure is that our plants have made our dorm rooms (and us) so much happier! If you’re holding back because you’re worried about the responsibility of plant-care, just remember, unlike children, if you neglect or accidentally kill your plant, you can just buy a new one and try again. Plants don’t judge or have feelings (at least, we think).
