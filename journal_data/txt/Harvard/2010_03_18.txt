After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The price of a year at Harvard College will break the $50,000 barrier next year as a result of a 3.8 percent hike in tuition, room, and board, the University announced today.
The total price tag of $50,724 will be accompanied by a 9 percent, or $13 million, increase in financial aid, keeping the average cost constant at about $11,500 for families receiving aid.
“In light of the challenges confronting families across America, we continue to expand our already generous financial aid program so that Harvard will remain accessible to families from all economic backgrounds,” Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said in a press release.
The record $158 million allotted to financial aid next year will put the estimated average grant at $40,000. More than 60 percent of Harvard undergraduates receive financial aid.
The 3.8 percent increase in tuition, room, and board—a deviation from the annual 3.5 percent growth in expenses over the past two years—is still lower than the average yearly 4.5 percent increase in total costs from 1997 to 2008. The hike is also lower than the average increase in combined expenses across the Ivy League for the 2010-2011 academic year, which is currently at 4.2 percent, though Columbia has yet to report next year’s tuition.
With the increase, Harvard will join several other Ivy League institutions with costs upwards of $50,000. Of the seven who have announced the price of tuition next year, only two of the Ancient Eight—Yale and Princeton—offer total costs of less than $50,000, with Princeton boasting the least expensive Ivy League education at $48,580.
Harvard’s percent increase in costs is also the second-lowest increase among these seven Ivy League institutions, beaten only by Princeton with a 3.3 percent increase.
MIT will be increasing total costs by 2.7 percent to $50,446.
Nationwide, increases in college tuition typically double the rate of inflation. Yesterday, the Dow Jones Newswires reported that the breakeven rate, considered to be a forecast of the inflation rate, indicated that investors anticipated an annual inflation rate of 2.25 percent throughout the decade.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite senior Jessica Pledger’s solid performance—going 2-for-4 with two RBI—the Harvard women’s softball team suffered a pair of losses this Tuesday at Smith Field in Los Angeles, Calif., losing to Loyola Marymount, 3-0, and Bucknell, 7-6.
Pledger was one of only four Crimson batters to record a hit in the Lions’ shutout, and she doubled against the Bison to give Harvard its first lead of the game.
“They are both good teams,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “I thought we came out a little flat against Loyola, but we came out strong against Bucknell…[Pledger] had two hits that drove in two runs that was a highlight.”
With the two losses, the Crimson falls to 4-7 on the season, but having not yet played any conference games, the team hopes to translate its preseason experiences into Ivy League victories.
LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3, HARVARD 0
The host Lions (5-11) shut out the Crimson on Tuesday, allowing only four hits in seven innings of play.
“We didn’t have as much energy as we would’ve liked,” senior Dana Roberts said, “[and] we weren’t really hitting the ball as well as we have been.”
In the second inning, with the scored tied at zero, Loyola Marymount’s Brittany Pereda recorded a two-run homer to center field off Harvard sophomore pitcher Rachel Brown. The Lions later built on that lead by scoring again in the fifth inning to make the score 3-0.
Brown took her first loss of the season on the mound while striking out eight and giving up no walks. Quite a few illegal pitches were called by the umpire on Brown and Loyola Marymount’s pitcher Melissa Dykema—much to the surprise of both coaches. Allard attributes Brown’s brief loss of focus to those calls.
“We had an empire that started to call illegal pitches for both pitchers,” she said. “He was calling these pitches unnecessarily. That was disappointing and kind of threw Rachel off, and she gave off a couple of key hits that were uncharacteristic.”
The Crimson’s best chance came in the top of the sixth inning, when the bases were loaded with two outs for freshman Jessica Ferri, who grounded out to shortstop.
“We actually got the basis loaded,” sophomore Whitney Shaw said. “That was our almost-comeback, [but] we just didn’t come out with the fire needed to beat them.”
BUCKNELL 7, HARVARD 6
The Bison (3-2) stole the game from the Crimson with a late four-score rally in the bottom of the sixth inning to notch a 7-6 victory. Ferri threw several wild pitches that advanced Bucknell base runners, and Brown could not stop the bleeding, as she allowed 4 RBI before ending the inning by catching a Bison base runner stealing.
“Unfortunately,” Roberts said, “after we got ahead 6-3, we didn’t have what it took to close the door in the sixth inning. They loaded the bases, and we changed pitchers. They were really gunning for us. They came back and scored four runs.”
Bucknell got the scoring started with a two-run first inning, but the Crimson responded by scoring once in the fourth and twice in the fifth while allowing one run in the fourth to tie the game at three.
Junior Emily Henderson sparked the Harvard offense with a single in the fourth followed by three consecutive stolen bases to score the first Crimson run of the game.
“[Henderson] got on base,” Roberts said, “[and] she basically stole second, stole third, [and] stole home to get us on the board, which was really a breakthrough inning for us.”
In addition, Harvard displayed flashes of defensive brilliance, with junior Ellen Macadam’s diving catch in shallow center field resulting in a double play to end the fifth inning. The sixth inning turned into a slugfest, with the Crimson recording three runs on four hits and the Bison taking four runs to make the game 7-6.
In the top of the seventh, the Crimson managed to get two on base before senior Jennifer Francis grounded out to end the game.
“We only had the top of the seventh to come back,” Roberts said, “and we just didn’t quite have enough.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team’s first postseason run in 61 seasons ended just as quickly as it began.
Playing in the first round of the College Insider.com Postseason Tournament, the Crimson (21-8, 10-4 Ivy) let an early 12-point lead slip away to Appalachian State (23-12, 13-5 Southern), as Harvard fell, 93-71.
“I really can’t explain it,” freshman Brandyn Curry said. “I don’t know what happened. We just didn’t have it tonight. I don’t know what team that was out there. I haven’t seen that team all year.”
Led by guard Donald Sims’ 22 points, the Mountaineers used their superior size and athleticism to keep the Crimson defenders on their heels, as Harvard surrendered more points than in any of its previous contests.
Appalachian State dominated the paint, outrebounding Harvard, 39-25, and coming away with 40 points in the paint compared to the Crimson’s 16.
Sophomore Keith Wright and freshman Kyle Casey, who have anchored Harvard in the post this season, pulled down just one and three boards, respectively. Co-captain Jeremy Lin led the Crimson on the glass once again, finishing with seven rebounds—three more than any of his teammates.
As successful as the Mountaineers were in the paint, they were even more dangerous from the outside.
Five different Appalachian State players connected from deep, and the team finished 12-of-21 from beyond the arc.
Sims led the way, sinking six three-pointers on 11 attempts, including four in the second half, which helped his team grow its lead to 22 points.
But despite the lopsided outcome, Harvard found itself in control for the early pat of the contest.
Behind six points from Casey, the Crimson jumped out to an 8-0 lead just 71 seconds into the contest, forcing Mountaineers’ coach Buzz Peterson to replace all five of his starters.
Fresh legs helped Appalachian State chip away at the Harvard lead, cutting the deficit to three after Andre Williamson’s post move and shot over Wright fell.
But freshman Christian Webster pushed his team’s lead back up.
Webster, who struggled shooting the ball consistently throughout the season, caught fire from deep, scoring the Crimson’s next 13 points to lead Harvard on a 15-6 run—putting the visitors ahead 30-12 with 10:24 left in the first half.
On the possession following Williamson’s bucket, the Crimson nearly lost control of the ball, but freshman Dee Giger deflected it to sophomore Oliver McNally, who swung it to Webster in the corner. Webster nailed the trey as he was fouled.
On Harvard’s next possession, McNally found Webster set up in the same spot on the fast break, where the rookie nailed the deep ball.
Webster found space in the corner once again, this time receiving a pass from Lin and draining the shot.
One possession later, Webster popped out behind the arc at the top of the key and hit his fourth three in under three minutes. Webster would finish with a career-high 24 points on a perfect 6-of-6 mark from deep.
“I just took my shots,” Webster said. “After I saw the first one go in, I just felt confident.”
But things would go downhill quickly for the Crimson.
Harvard scored just seven points over the next 10 minutes of play, as the Mountaineers closed out the half on a 25-7 run.
“They just really dug in with defense and pressure,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “You could just tell how they turned up the pressure.”
Two baskets from Williamson in the paint and deep balls from Sims and Kellen Brand narrowed the Crimson’s lead to two.
But Harvard was able to fend off the home team for some time, extending its lead to seven at 37-30 with 4:27 left.
Then things went from bad to worse.
The Crimson went scoreless for the rest of the half and Appalachian State grabbed the lead for the first time with 1:27 remaining off a coast-to-coast layup from Brand.
Plagued by turnovers and missed shots the rest of the way, Harvard closed the half down by six.
Things would not improve coming out of the break, as the Crimson was never able to get the deficit below six for the remainder of the contest—capping off the most successful Harvard basketball season with a disappointing ending.
“I’m proud of the year we were able to accomplish this season,” Amaker said. “It’s a tough way to end with our seniors, but nonetheless I thought our kids gave great effort—but we ran into a team tonight that played exceptionally well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just when the offense started working, defense let the Crimson down. The Harvard men’s volleyball team (1-11, 1-1 EIVA) came up short on the road again on Wednesday, making a brief comeback attempt before falling to Rivier, 3-1, in Nashua, N.H.
“I thought we did some things really well and some things poorly, but in the end what we didn’t do well [mattered] more,” co-captain Gil Weintraub said.
After weeks of struggling to generate offense, the Crimson seemed to find its stroke. Sophomore outside hitters Matt Jones and Nicola Ivica had big nights— notching 14 kills each—but Harvard could not keep its Raider counterparts at bay.
Rivier (24-7) took the first six points of the match to build an early lead and kept its foot on the pedal with a number of forceful kills, winning the first set, 30-24.
“Blocking, defense, and preventing the other team from getting points is our goal,” Weintraub said. “At the beginning of the season we had trouble translating our offense, but playing strong defense is the next step.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, it took too long to implement this step. The Raiders cruised through the second set, to the tune of a 30-22 margin, before Harvard could make an effective stand.
After struggling to adjust to the low ceiling in Rivier’s gym, which interfered with passing on both sides, the Crimson opted to shorten the points by going for big serves.
“We decided to bomb jump serves and it worked in our favor,” said Weintraub of the third set. “It made it tough for them to run their offense…but we weren’t able to maintain that.”
Using its attacking service style, Harvard bounced back to take the set, 30-24, but in the end the Raider offense proved too strong.
With setter Zach Hansen dishing out 45 assists, Rivier hitters consistently found opportunities to attack, amassing a standout .341 hitting percentage.
Jared Andreozzi proved particularly forceful as he tallied a match-high 18 kills—helping the Raiders close out the contest with a 30-24 win in the fourth set.
Still, as the Crimson fell to another strong team on the road, Weintraub recognized the importance of facing such talented competition with the bulk of conference play ahead.
“[Non-conference matches] are invaluable to show us where we need to improve—where we’re good and where we’re weak,” he said. “They’re diagnostics…I’m very grateful we’ve had a long non-conference season. Now that we’re entering a stretch of very important games, we can work on our offense, defense, receiving, and serving.”
Harvard at least knows that it can depend on its offensive stalwarts, including Jones and Ivica.
With Weintraub back in the setting role, notching 41 assists on Wednesday, the outside hitters are able to exhibit their talent. Co-captain Eric Kuld added 12 kills, but the two sophomores have stood out in particular.
“We moved [Jones and Ivica] out of the middle to the outsides to let them run free,” Weintraub explained. “Matt Jones jumps real well outside and…Nicola is a very experienced player. Both are very formidable.”
While the offense appears to have the tools to keep the Crimson competitive in EIVA matches, the squad needs to hone a complete game if it hopes to turn around its season.
In addition to building on its defense, Harvard will look to improve on its serving in order to control contests as it did briefly against the Raiders.
“Consistent serving is important,” Weintraub said. “It’s one thing to be able to run your offense and slow down your [opponent’s] offense, but to be able to put pressure on at the start makes our job on every front easier. So keeping the ball in and making sure the serve is tough are keys to our success.”

Just in case the weather has you down (or you've  already done all of your required reading for the spring term), we at FlyBy asked faculty members to give some reading suggestions for the remaining days of spring break. Here's what they told us.
Andrew  J. Berry - Lecturer on Organismic and  Evolutionary Biology
Alfred R.  Wallace's Malay Archipelago
Wallace, the co-discoverer with Charles Darwin of  evolution by natural selection, produced this classic of Victorian  travel writing on his return from eight extraordinary years of  scientific exploration throughout South East Asia. A mix of travelogue,  science, ethnography, and pure adventure, it is wonderfully readable  (much more so, frankly, than Darwin's Voyage of  the Beagle), and reveals a Wallace forever  struggling to reconcile his child-like sense of wonder at what he is  seeing with the stiff-upper-lip expectations of his Victorian audience.  Perhaps this conflict is best captured by his account of a previous  expedition that ended disastrously when his ship home from Brazil caught  fire in the middle of the Atlantic, leaving Wallace and ship's crew  adrift in an open boat for ten days until rescue arrived. "During the  night I saw several meteors, and in fact could not be in a better  position for observing them, than lying on my back in a small boat in  the middle of the Atlantic." Positive-thinking, Victorian-style! Reading  Wallace is a wonderful antidote to the prevalent notion that the theory  of evolution is Darwin's, and Darwin's alone.
N. Gregory Mankiw -  Robert M. Beren  Professor of Economics
Milton Friedman's Capitalism  and Freedom
Friedman was one of  the most important economists during the second half of the twentieth  century.  In this book, he explains his approach to economic policy,  which includes more emphasis on personal freedom and market mechanisms  and less emphasis on centralized governmental solutions. This book is  always one of the favorites of students in my freshman seminar. Both  those who agree with it and those who don't appreciate Friedman's  straightforward, logical prose.
Richard  W. Wrangham - Ruth Moore Professor of  Biological Anthropology, Harvard College  Professor, Master of Currier House
David  A. Hamburg's Preventing Genocide: Practical  Steps Toward Early Detection and Effective Action
 
 The frequency of war may be in decline but international  tensions are often high, fuelled by rising populations and expected  resource shortages. Preventing Genocide shows how mass violence has been avoided, and how it can be  reduced in the future. For anyone seriously concerned about a dangerous  future, Hamburg's prescription for avoiding deadly conflict is an  invaluable "how-to" guide. In Larry Diamond's words, this book "is a  work of profound empathy, analytic insight, historical erudition and  disciplined passion." It shows that genocide is preventable, but it also  demands that we engage in the problem. It will make you a practical  optimist.
Timothy P. McCarthy - Lecturer in History and Literature, Adjunct Lecturer on Public Policy at the  John F. Kennedy School of Government, Tutor in Quincy House
Martin Luther King Jr.'s Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or  Community?
This  week, I'm down in Hayneville, Alabama - between Selma and Montgomery -  on an Alternative Spring Break trip. My students and I are here to help  rebuild a black church that was burned in an arson attack a few years  ago. I am taking this opportunity to re-read Dr. Martin Luther King  Jr.'s classic book, Where Do We Go From Here:  Chaos or Community? This was King's final  book, written the year before his assassination, at a time of profound  transition—not only for the black freedom struggle he helped to lead,  but also for a nation still struggling to overcome the burdens of its  complex history. This was King's deepest meditation on the intersecting  crises of racism, poverty, and war, and it offers a prophetic roadmap  for all of us who are still struggling to find community and justice in  the midst of chaos and division. These matters weighed heavily on Dr.  King in 1967, and they should weigh heavily on all of us who still dare  to dream of a better world.
Howard M.  Georgi - Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics,  Harvard College Professor, Master of Leverett House
Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle 
 
Religion, science, history,  bureaucracy, a hilarious end of the world story—what more could you  want? Anyone who has not read this book at least twice should do so.
Logan S. McCarty - Lecturer on  Chemistry, Chemical Biology, and Physics, Assistant Dean of the College
W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human  Bondage
 
 
Many critics have written more eloquently than I  ever could about what makes this novel great. It shows in exquisite and often  painful detail  how our adult personalities are shaped by our own choices (which may not be as free as  we think they are) and by powerful forces beyond our control. Maugham has a  remarkable ability to evoke a vivid, realistic world with seemingly simple prose. Warning: not a happy fun  book.
Roger B. Porter - IBM Professor of  Business and Government at the John F. Kennedy School of Government,  Master of Dunster House
John Buchan's Pilgrim's Way 
 
Pilgrim's Way is the gracefully written memoir of John Buchan (Lord  Tweedsmuir) who grew up in Scotland, attended Oxford, served in  Parliament, and was Governor General of Canada at the time of his death  in 1940. A prolific author, he lived as well as wrote about history. His  portraits of contemporaries are full of insight. His philosophy of life  is both challenging and inspiring and as relevant to today's world as  it was to his generation. Not least, his prose is a pleasure to read.
