After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A story of 1950s teenagers falling in, out, and back into love may sound sentimental, but the latest production of “Grease”—which runs through Saturday at the Loeb Experimental Theater—delves into the darker side of this romantic narrative. Still, while the publicity materials emphasized the edgier aspects of the plot, the parts that were cut from more conventional productions, this version is actually quite traditional in terms of its content. Few changes seem to have been made to the script, and the visual aspects of the show—the costumes, the set design, the choreography—remain true to the story’s original tone.
“Grease” concerns itself with the familiar romance between Danny and Sandy, two students who must deal with their clashing personalities among the other tribulations of attending high school in the 1950s. Though the story is famous, director Mia P. Walker ’10, who is also a Crimson arts writer, claims in the program, “This is our Grease.” Although only a few liberties are taken with the content of the play, Walker is right; what this interpretation lacks in originality it more than makes up for in talent and ambition.
The play takes full advantage of every inch of space in the Loeb Ex with a complex set that allows many of the musical’s locales to be visible at once. For the audience, this means watching the two-hour long play from a set of uncomfortable bleachers; for the cast, it results in the main ensemble being onstage for almost the entire production, resulting in a sense of multidimensionality in a story that is too often reduced to the romance between Danny and Sandy. The subplots are equally compelling as the main narrative, particularly the storyline revolving around around Rizzo’s pregnancy. By keeping the actors onstage for the bulk of the production, the audience is never allowed to forget that this is about all of the characters—and in this sense, HRDC’s “Grease” is doing something new.
The choice to punctuate scenes with snippets from radio broadcasts further broadens the scope of the show, and it seems that this decision—to emphasize the many over the few, to make the story about high school instead of a hackneyed teen romance—is what distinguishes the play from the more familiar version of “Grease.” In this, Walker has succeeded.
This is not to say, however, that “Grease” is perfect. The accompanying live band is talented and their inclusion in the sound design adds texture to a story primarily told through musical numbers; however, the band’s volume usually overwhelms the actors’ singing, and anyone who doesn’t already know the words to the songs may get lost.
Isabel Q. Carey ’12 and Benjamin K. Moss ’13, who play Rizzo and Danny, respectively, are able to sing over the band in their solo numbers, but not all of the actors have the same vocal power.  The ensemble numbers encounter a similar problem, with the voices of the chorus and the live band making it difficult to distinguish the lyrics. The choreography in these sequences, however, remains quite solid and helps to make up for any musical deficiencies.
This production of “Grease” features skilled performances, especially from the supporting cast. Carey’s performance as Rizzo is outstanding; she completely inhabits the character physically, and she speaks with enough affectation to convey her character’s cynicism without being overbearing. Moss and Talisa B. Friedman ’10, who plays Sandy, are quite competent but lack Carey’s flair—although this may have more to do with their roles, which offer much less dramatic material to work with.
The real pleasure of “Grease,” though, comes from watching the greasers and the Pink Ladies. Although their scenes mainly offer comic relief, their banter is energetic and perfectly timed. The interaction between these characters has the power to induce nostalgia in those who might otherwise look back on their high school days with nothing less than disdain. Every speaking character has practiced and acquired what one imagines to be the accent of the 1950s. And although no one should expect “Grease” to be historically accurate, such flourishes are appreciated.
Like its teenaged characters, the story is more concerned with flashy musical numbers and its own happy ending, so if this “Grease” lacks a certain grit or emotional realism, no one can blame it. Despite some small missteps, Walker has taken an old standard and executed it faithfully and competently to create a dynamic production.

“A sad song’s best for winter,” R&B queen Serena tells her young son in the American Repertory Theater’s “Best of Both Worlds,” the new gospel adaptation of Shakespeare’s “The Winter’s Tale” playing at the Loeb Drama Center through Jan. 3. Unfortunately, such sad songs are just about the only agreeable aspect of the show; to deem anything the “best” in this disappointingly mediocre production would be to issue a gross overstatement. Though it offers a wonderful musical experience, “Best of Both Worlds” ultimately demonstrates the potential pitfalls of an emphasis on active spectatorship.
“Best of Both Worlds” frames “The Winter’s Tale” in an R&B world in which Shakespeare’s rival monarchs are now kings of soul, or “chocolate royalty,” and music has the power to heal. One of the kings, Ezekiel (Gregg Baker), devastates his empire when he accuses wife Serena (Jeanette Bayardelle) of having an affair with his former best friend Maurice (Darius de Haas). Despair at Serena’s banishment eventually leads to redemption in the restorative second act.
On a purely technical level, the design elements are fantastic, and all of the performances are outstanding. In particular, Jeannette Bayardelle’s Serena is strong, regal, and utterly unforgettable, especially during her show-stopping solo “The Way I Love You.” Diedre Murray’s music is lovely, even if it gets lost in the excess of sung exposition. Regrettably, compelling performances and extraordinary singing cannot carry a show this poorly written.
To be fair, many of the plot problems are no fault of librettist and lyricist Randy Weiner ’87-’88. Shakespeare’s play is inherently flawed, from its undeserved redemption of Leontes (here, Ezekiel) to the dull romance between Perdita and Florizel (now Rain and Tariq). However, in his adaptation, Weiner makes no attempt to remedy any of the source story’s faults. Instead, he offers pat lines that tackily acknowledge the tale’s weaknesses. While these little fixes are cloyingly cute, they hardly improve upon the story; in fact, they actually highlight its failings.
The weak writing is but one of this production’s many errors. What has been so successful in the A.R.T.’s season thus far—active spectatorship—simply makes no sense in this show. Weiner and director Diane M. Paulus ’87 attempt to break down the fourth wall and make the audience active participants, from the house manager’s opening announcement to the juvenile and unnecessary narration. In one moment, a character stops to ask if the audience has noticed the two men in trench coats and sunglasses who have walked onto the stage to visibly spy on Rain and Tariq. Yes, Mr. Weiner, we see them; there’s really no need to ask.
Yet, even if it had been done effectively, in this type of theatrical production, why should the audience be involved? What does it achieve, other than alienating those audience members who refuse to get on their feet at the end of the show for what is essentially a forced standing ovation?
This failed attempt at active spectatorship has deeper ramifications than the superfluous narration. In the most magical and dramatic moment of the musical—Serena’s statue coming to life—the blocking distracts from the beauty of the restoration. The actors peer towards the audience at the “statue,” only to have Serena actually enter from behind the set’s giant garage door in a burst of fog, light, and gospel song. As the resurrection is the emotional climax of the show, this execution is both disappointing and baffling. The fourth wall is indeed broken, but perhaps not as Paulus intended; instead, the audience is taken out of the moment, wondering what the characters are staring at.
This magical moment also leads to the abrupt religious awakening “Best of Both Worlds” seems to undergo. For an alleged gospel musical, the show hardly contains spiritual overtones until the very end—and by then, it is too late to force these ideas on the audience quite so intensely.
“Best of Both Worlds” seems to inadvertently illustrate that there is a limit to active spectatorship in the theater. There is nothing wrong with the audience simply sitting in their seats and watching a show in front of them, especially when it best serves the material. Ultimately, the gospel music that cures the soul and Ezekiel’s family fails to cure this production’s many woes. Music’s healing power has reached its limit.

It seemed like an improbable love affair. By June 1992, The Weekly World News had already been conjuring bizarre creatures, unusual sightings, and freakish situations for 13 years, and if Hollywood hadn’t already put the public through the ringer of supernatural scenarios, then WWN was probably coming scarily close to filling any gaps in the collective imagination. But whether it was the strangely sympathetic, glassy round eyes or the face that rivaled Macaulay Culkin’s “Scream” impression, Bat Boy, who made an appearance for the first time that month, caught the attention of shoppers and soon became the sweetheart of supermarket tabloid.
Five years later, the half-boy, half-bat sensation was causing a stir off-Broadway as the lead character in “Bat Boy: The Musical,” a production created in cooperation with WWN. Currently playing at the New College Theatre under the direction of Matthew I. Bohrer ’10 through Dec. 11, this adaptation of the creature’s life from his discovery onward indulges the audience in the spectacular task of answering the question “What is it?” Part moral inquiry, part love story, and primarily ridiculous, “Bat Boy: The Musical” does not fail to entertain with its tragically comic and campy story of acceptance. Unfortunately, though, just like the idea of the Bat Boy himself, the show, at times, sounds a little off.
“Bat Boy” opens on three teens—Ron, Rick, and Ruthie Taylor—preparing to get just a little bit closer to nature in the dark environs of a local cave, but they are promptly interrupted by the appearance of the show’s namesake, played by Walter B. Klyce ’10. After the confused cave creature bites young Ruthie (Maya S. Sugarman), he is taken to the home of the dashing and devilish Dr. Thomas Parker (Adam M. Lathram), where his charming wife Meredith (Megan L. Amram ’10) and daughter Shelley (Samara R. Oster ’13) take charge of his care. What unfolds is a story familiar in its conception if not in its ultimate resolution. Slowly but surely, the strange monster is civilized, though the religious townspeople continue to live in a hypocritical state of fear of this foreign creature (his strangeness cemented in the humorous acquisition of a British accent); once their cautious acceptance is granted, a bizarre twist of events unjustly casts the Bat Boy—deemed Edgar by his new family—back into the position of a dangerous beast, and the climatic chase ensues.
Set in the aptly named Hope Falls, West Virginia, “Bat Boy” could be seen as a critique of the hypocrisy inherent in “Christian charity” (obviously, they don’t want the strange man-bat creature to attend their special revival weekend) or as the painful journey to ignore one’s inner animal instincts and just fit in. Even more strangely, it could be seen as a story of love: the failed love of Dr. and Mrs. Parker or the bizarre romance that develops between Shelley and Edgar. The first act, though entertaining for the most part, drags on, as it is merely a set up for the surprisingly ridiculous second half, in which the latter love story reveals itself—surprisingly, since throughout the earlier interactions between two, their chemistry suggests nothing more than a platonic relationship, as between a brother and sister. The one instance in which they find themselves uncomfortably close is hardly enough to foreshadow the extent to which Shelley’s feelings for Edgar grow; these are eventually manifested in a scene that imagines an orgy set in the Garden of Eden, an instance of debauchery that pays tribute to the skills of choreographer Ricky D. Kuperman ’11.
In fact the whole cast is, perhaps not surprisingly, very talented. Klyce’s portrayal of Bat Boy is particularly remarkable; his arms and legs contort through most of the show into the sharp angles of a bat’s claws and legs in a performance that conveys a particularly strange animalistic posture with amazing naturalness. As the show progresses, his stance adjusts in an impressive expression of humanity through body language, and his voice transforms from the gargles of playful stupidity to the more articulate confusion of one bewildered but generally prepared to cope with the strangeness of society (for fans of “Futurama,” Gunther could be used as a reference point).
Equally impressive is the freshman Oster. She is thoroughly endearing as the Beauty to Klyce’s Beast, capturing each of her songs with a soulfulness that can make even the most comedic of numbers heart-wrenching. Her only shortfall comes with the uncomfortable rhythm of “Whatcha Wanna Do?” a rap duet that neither she nor her partner, Jonathan Finn-Gamino ’12 as her temporary love interest Rick Taylor, can salvage; the initial idea itself is not doomed, however, and it’s a number that could be fun if only they could get hold of the beat and lose the awkwardness inherent in the rapping of a pair of white kids.
It is in these sorts of unfortunate musical incongruities that the show—from the outset walking the line between theatrical wit and tackiness—stumbles, keeping it from being the completely charming piece of outrageous spectacle that it is meant to be. It is in instances when the music, directed by Alex B. Lipton ’11, competes too closely with the voices of the players or in moments when the confusing appearance of seemingly bored back-up singers provide a negative contrast rather than the overwhelming complement that was probably intended, that the production falters and the audience is uncomfortably snapped out of the enchantment they had just been lured into.
Nonetheless, the silly extravaganza that is the “fact meets fiction” of “Bat Boy: The Musical” manages to keep the wonder going even beyond the show’s incredibly tragic end. In the world of tabloid fantasy, love can be open to all, death is no longer a barrier to hope, and the optimism of the seemingly impossible can still ring out: Bat Boy lives!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Tuesday, President Obama announced that he would inject 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan by mid-year and begin withdrawing them a year later in July 2011. His primetime speech may have lacked the confidence and gusto of the usual American call to arms, but overall Obama has made some smart decisions about this country’s future involvement in Afghanistan.
The speech was reasoned and academic—Obama took care to talk out the pros and cons of some of the more publicly discussed scenarios for future American military involvement. This motif hinted at the thoroughness of Obama’s months-long strategy review. Calls of “dithering” aside, the president rightly seems to have left no stone unturned. He approached the problem not only with an open mind but also with an eye to the longer-term consequences of every potential strategy, both for Afghanistan and the United States.
At the most basic level, the decision to pursue a troop surge is wise and well thought out. In his speech, Obama emphasized that Afghanistan is not a new Vietnam. Unlike that war, the Afghan one is being fought by a 43-nation collation against not a popular insurgency, but one on the fringe of society. Also, on 9/11, the U.S. was attacked by terrorists harbored by those whom we fight in Afghanistan today. If the Afghan government were to fall once again to them, those attacks are proof enough that there would be direct negative repercussions on American national security.
The new strategy calls for a quick deployment of not just 30,000 American troops, but also 10,000 or so NATO troops, to the most volatile parts of Afghanistan. We call on Canada and our European allies to heed the American call and shoulder a more proportionate responsibility for our mutual security.
In the field, many of the fresh troops will fight embedded within Afghan units, providing the Afghans with valuable on-the-job training. The military and Afghan government will concurrently incentivize less zealous Taliban fighters to lay down their arms or switch sides during a phase of “reconciliation and reintegration.”
The new combined strategy will quickly destroy al-Qaeda and destabilize an increasingly well-organized Taliban, providing a vacuum into which the strengthening Afghan forces and reforming Afghan government can step. From this new position of strength, the Afghan government should be able to keep the Taliban at bay and keep al-Qaeda out.
These new objectives take into consideration the realities of Afghan tribal society. Obama has wisely accepted the Taliban as a faction of that society and is choosing instead to focus on the real threat to American security, radical al-Qaeda.
If the new Afghan strategy sounds familiar, that is because it draws heavily on the successful counterinsurgency tactics learned the hard way in Iraq. Regardless, since the start of Obama’s strategic review three months ago, a large number of Democrats in particular have been critical of any plan that involves moving from the status quo toward any more American involvement in Afghanistan. They seem to have forgotten that, during his presidential campaign, Obama stressed that Afghanistan was a battle worth fighting and one that should be a focus of any U.S. administration.
Lost to this newfound pragmatism, though, is the idealistic rhetoric of the Bush era, which advocated building up infrastructure, the economy, and civil society alongside a vibrant democracy as the road to perpetual peace. Obama’s strategy also calls for a dedicated shift from nation building to a more cost- and time-efficient policy of simply destroying the enemy and leaving Afghanistan with a functioning and effectual government.
In his speech, Obama defended this decision: “As president, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests, and I must weigh all of the challenges that our nation faces; I don’t have the luxury of committing to just one.” The president claimed that another decade of nation building in Afghanistan would hardly incentivize the Afghan government to take the reins and would distract from imperative domestic issues including health care, education, and economic reform.
Though his argument is not without merit, we worry that Obama’s lack of commitment to protecting democracy will give Afghan citizens a sense that the U.S. is not fully committed to their well-being and that the Afghan government is no more legitimate than the parallel one operated by the Taliban. They, and Pakistan, will rightly continue to hedge their bets and be non-committal to either warring party.
A demonstrable commitment to building a robust, honest, and representative Afghan nation, though expensive, would foster friendships and alliances that would also help achieve Obama’s ultimate objectives—to push out al-Qaeda and quiet the Taliban. Pakistan’s cooperation is especially vital to these ends. Its government must know that America is a committed and honest ally if we are to expect more help in achieving them.
Critics on the left contend that, if Obama’s new military strategy is not as quickly effective as the president hopes, America may still have a potential quagmire on its hands. In this regard, the drawdown timeline is reassuring. It is important that Obama has established that our goals in Afghanistan do not require long-term troop involvement.
However, we remain skeptical that the president’s reasons for setting so specific a date to begin withdrawal are not purely political—as opposed to strategic. Obama emphasized that any drawdown starting in July 2011 will be conditional upon the situation that develops on the ground. Because this catch obviously holds the power to render the timeline meaningless, it seems the date is only a political concession to the nation’s left, meant to quell discontent among those who feel America should leave Afghanistan today.
Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Obama’s top military adviser, made it clear last week on Charlie Rose that a full withdrawal date was not even part of the discussion. “The 2011 timeframe is out there as a goal for us to shoot for and to begin the transfer of security responsibility and the transition. It could be a lot of forces, it could be very few forces—we just don’t know.”
As such, critics on the right, primarily Republican leaders, looking to take a jab at the president, who conflate the potential drawdown date with a total withdrawal of an American commitment to Afghanistan, seem to be deliberately misleading the public and are hardly being constructive.
Regardless, Obama’s stated rationale in support of the given timeline is sound enough. A drawdown date, however definite, will certainly incentivize the Afghan government to get its act together and try to take more responsibility for its own security. But given its current weakness, whether it can begin to effectively do this in just 18 months is far from a given.
Despite the uncertain road ahead, Obama is correct in asserting that, if Afghan security forces cannot begin to keep the Taliban at bay and al-Qaeda out of its borders on their own, an American military drawdown would be disastrous for America’s own security.

Once upon a time, what we now consider science was regarded as alchemy, and the subject was synonymous with things like witchcraft, jinxes, and time travel. If you had influenza, a wicked old witch had probably jinxed you; if your crops didn’t yield, you must have invoked a family curse. For a long life or the ability to turn base metals into gold, it was not medicine or a chemical lab you sought, but an alchemist or a magician. In those days, our actions were manipulated by the fates.
Perhaps that past era has returned. Physicists have a new theory regarding the Large Hadron Collider—and contrary to your initial suspicions, it has less to do with particles and more to do with destiny. According to renowned scientists Holger Bech Nielsen, of the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, and Masao Ninomiya, of the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics in Kyoto, perhaps free will is not as scientifically sound a concept as our modern philosophy so makes it out to be.
Writes Denis Overbye in The New York Times, “A pair of otherwise distinguished physicists have suggested that the hypothesized Higgs boson, which physicists hope to produce with the collider, might be so abhorrent to nature that its creation would ripple backward through time and stop the collider before it could make one, like a time traveler who goes back in time to kill his grandfather.” In other words, creating an amount of energy three to four times times the amount created during a nuclear fission reaction—a possibility realizable with the detonation of an atomic bomb—could produce such catastrophic results that the future might travel back in time to prevent such a thing from occurring.
While many learned modern men have taken pride in separating themselves from the antiquated belief that their actions are controlled by anyone but themselves, these physicists, looking to the Large Hadron Collider, seem to reject the concept that human beings have free will and embrace the idea of fate.
Indeed, necessity, rather than choice, seems to govern much of the natural world. When two of the smallest units of matter, protons and electrons, are placed within the same force field without any outside forces acting, a force of attraction inevitably draws them toward one other. Similarly, we know that everything in the universe can be divided into two groups—particles and forces—and that these two groups are constantly at work changing the dynamics of the universe. As part of this universe, human beings are also a composition of both forces and particles; hypothetically, if one could gather all the data on all the forces and particles in existence and learn all the laws of interaction that govern them, it would be possible to calculate exactly how these particles and forces interact in an equation that would proceed until the end of time. Discerning the events of the past, future, or present in any given context would imply that human beings do not have the free will they assume.
“For those of us who believe in physics,” Einstein once wrote to a friend, “this separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion.” Perhaps what we have imagined to be a philosophical question has now revealed itself to be a question of science. When they speculated about the consequences the Large Hadron Collider would have for human civilization, physicists probably didn’t expect to answer the question of free will as well. Whether the world’s largest particle collider will ever succeed in creating a Higgs boson effect, it has already made a hefty contribution to the field of philosophy.

On October 24, I attended a service day at Shubow Park in Brighton to repair a playground that had been neglected for some time. The service day had not been arranged by PBHA or one of the many community-service groups on campus, but instead by one of the U.S. Senate candidates running to fill the seat of Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56: Alan A. Khazei ’83. Working in the park that afternoon revealed to me what an innovative and unique campaign Khazei was running—one that wasn’t based on a debate over big government or small government, but rather on active citizenship and public service. Seeing the group of mostly college-age students at work that day persuaded me of the sincerity of the Khazei campaign and of the value of his platform. Alan Khazei showed me that day he is the right choice for the Senate.
Khazei’s platform, which centers on the idea of “Big Citizenship,” is based on increasing citizen engagement with the political process—and not just during election years. Khazei believes that citizens have the power to articulate and effectually fix the major social problems of our time. As The Boston Globe noted in its endorsement of Khazei, his ideas provide a welcome relief from “Reagan-era skepticism” about the power of the government by  thinking up unconventional ways to solve the nation’s biggest problems. Citizens have the real power to influence the nature of political initiatives in the coming years and choose the United States’s social agenda, but the extent of that influence depends on their engagement in the present. Alan Khazei is the candidate best equipped to increase citizens’ participation and help them shape their own political futures in this nation.
Khazei’s platform is not solely based on the rhetoric of Big Citizenship, however; he has over two decades of public-service experience. In 1988, Khazei co-founded City Year, a program that provides young adults between the ages of 17 and 24 with the chance to participate in 10 months of community service. Khazei’s insight was noted by none other than President Bill Clinton: In 1994, Clinton used City Year as a template in initiating the $250 million AmeriCorps program.
Khazei’s extensive work in public service has given him the kind of political experiences he will need to be a true coalition builder in the Senate. Khazei has already reached across the aisle in his attempts to implement a City Year-esque service program on a national level. His devotion to the objectives of Big Citizenship supersedes his commitment to any party platform, and he is the least likely of the Democratic candidates to fall into an ideological lockstep with his party. Khazei’s public-service initiatives have also given him insights into the lawmaking process in Washington: A bill that calls for 250,000 volunteers to serve in a domestic Peace Corps program is the result of efforts by Khazei, who worked closely with Senator Kennedy in pushing the bill through Congress.
Accordingly, “grassroots” is a huge theme for Khazei’s campaign, and he sees public, not special-interest, engagement as the key to success in the Senate as well. He has accepted no money from PAC or lobbyist groups but instead is basing his campaign on private citizen donations. Khazei’s work in Washington will not be bound to lobbyist groups or special interests, but to the citizens of Massachusetts, whom he promises to serve devotedly.
In terms of his policies, Khazei has outlined the most articulate and well-thought-out proposals on the situation in Afghanistan and on education. As a recent Newsweek article noted, he is the only candidate who completely supports President Obama’s plan for education reform, promoting more accountable ways of measuring teachers’ effectiveness and supporting the expansion of charter schools to ensure higher graduation rates in some of America’s most underachieving districts. Whereas the remaining three candidates have hedged on supporting comprehensive education reform in the face of pressure from teachers’ unions, Khazei is the only candidate to outline a full, articulate, and broad-based plan to improve America’s schools.
As The Boston Globe noted, in a campaign in which most of the Democratic candidates will probably vote the same way on many bills in the Senate, the difference between them rests more on personal leadership than on political division. Congressman Michael E. Capuano (D-Mass.), building a campaign that runs on antagonism more than on state unity, lacks the tools that will be necessary for coalition building and cross-party negotiations in the Senate. In addition, Attorney General Martha M. Coakley’s tentative approach to policy reform tends to overlook valuable opportunities for legislative improvement. Boston Celtics co-owner Stephen G. Pagliuca would bring burnished business credentials to his position as a senator, but his questionable knowledge in debates has called his abilities as a policymaker into question. In contrast, Alan Khazei combines an analytical approach to policymaking with the kind of legislative energy that is necessary to ensure real reform in the Senate.
Khazei’s campaign promises and the actions he has used to back them up have garnered him strong support on the Harvard campus, and the Harvard Students for Khazei group has been an active presence at rallies and events in support of the candidate. As the candidate with the most passionate support at Harvard, Alan Khazei has convinced Harvard students to support him, and he has convinced me to support him. As The Globe put it, he represents “Massachusetts’ best chance to produce the next great senator,” and he embodies a tradition that Ted Kennedy proudly upheld during his congressional tenure. As a worthy successor to the “Lion of the Senate,” only one candidate can effectively fill the spot. Hopefully, voters making it out to the polls (open between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Tuesday) will remember that that candidate is Alan Khazei.

Even as a small child, I recognized, although I didn’t fully comprehend, the irony of my Indian Barbie. Mattel had released a series of “international” dolls, dressed in stylish ethnic garb that draped beautifully over Barbie’s unrealistically proportioned body. The Indian edition was sari-clad and even came complete with a bindi. The blond-haired, blue-eyed figurine looked like a miniature Michaele Salahi. I recognized her as the wealthy, white American who always got the best table at restaurants in India. She’d stayed at a fancy resort for a week and appropriated my parents’ culture, and she had the red dot to prove it. I distinctly recall my frustration. I wanted my Barbie to look like me. I wonder now if what I really wanted was to look like my Barbie.
Mattel’s first minority doll was released in 1968, marketed as Barbie’s black friend. The company stopped painting white dolls black 12 years later. Instead, as Lisa Jones of The Village Voice wrote, it fashioned a doll made of “brown plastic poured into blond Barbie’s mold.” (Metaphors abound.) Recently, the company broke the mold and released a new line consisting entirely of black dolls. However, in the group of six, five have long, straightened hair, and three have blue or green eyes. These discrepancies compelled The Wall Street Journal’s Ann Zimmerman to ask, “Are Mattel’s New Dolls Black Enough?” It’s a question that many are clamoring to answer. Some of the mothers interviewed had incredibly positive things to say about the line; one said she could now “show her daughter that you don’t have to have a pointed nose to be beautiful.” Another mother complained about the uproar, arguing that a doll with a kinkier hairstyle would have been billed as too afro-centric. “We’re so hard and picky,” she bemoaned.
In an essay titled “Life with Daughters: Watching the Miss America Pageant,” Gerald Early parses a photograph in which a young, hospitalized African American girl is clutching a white doll, a gift from then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy ’48. He held that presenting the child with a black doll would have been insulting, an implication that she was, in some way, not fully integrated into mainstream America. Instead, with the act, Kennedy had declared that “she was worthy of the same kind of doll that a white girl would have.” Yet the image is chilling, a fact duly noted by Early, who describes it as “a black girl hugging a white doll because everyone thinks it is best for her to have it.”
It’s been over a decade since I selected my beloved Indian Barbie from the shelves of the toy store, handed it to my parents, and assured them that, yes, this was the doll I wanted. I still don’t fully comprehend the irony. I would be insulted, I think, if a white person were to present my potentially dark-skinned daughter with an Indian doll, perhaps for the same reasons Early implies. When my white friends proudly inform me of the Indian food they ate recently, I enthusiastically report that I spoke English the other day. “How multicultural am I?” I obnoxiously beam. Giving my theoretical daughter an Indian doll would be a self-congratulatory and degrading gesture. It would not only acknowledge, but emphasize, and perhaps consign me to a realm of, otherness. Such things are not done in polite society.
Yet my discomfort with this idea doesn’t preclude my providing my children with minority dolls, which makes Mattel’s new line personally relevant. To presume that six dolls can encompass an entire race is absurd. Mothers are right to be hard and picky about the images that are exposed to and engage with their daughters. It’s called parenting. And Mattel will likely respond in kind. (The company already plans to introduce a doll with an afro to the line.) In an ideal world, when wandering through the aisles of a toy store stuffed with a rainbow of Barbie dolls, my daughter would be able to point to the one who looks exactly like her, to say “That doll is beautiful. That doll is the one I want.” But this begs the unsettling question: What if she doesn’t?
I pray that my daughter will have that choice to make, if only so that I can tell an annoying parent story. (“Back in my day, we only had blonde Barbies to choose from. Have you seen mommy’s toy from the early ’90s?”) But if she does, and still settles on a white doll, it will be because things haven’t changed as much as we’d like to believe. I can only hope that my daughter won’t need Mattel to tell her that you don’t have to have a pointed nose to be beautiful. The current homogeneity of the doll market is not just a cause of highly racialized conceptions of beauty, but also a reflection of them. Black Barbies may be a step in the right direction, but at the end of the day it’s just plastic.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The family of a Harvard undergraduate who committed suicide two years ago filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Harvard College and two professionals at University Health Services on Wednesday.
John B. Edwards III ’10 was a sophomore preparing for a medical career and training for the Boston Marathon when he committed suicide in November 2007.
The lawsuit, filed by his father, John B. Edwards II, alleges that his son sought care at UHS in June 2007, “frustrated because he could not study for as long a period as his friends.” A nurse practitioner at UHS diagnosed Edwards with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and prescribed Adderall, according to the lawsuit.
In August 2007, Edwards again saw the nurse practitioner, Marianne Cannon, who diagnosed Edwards with an anxiety disorder, later prescribing the antidepressants Prozac and then Wellbutrin, the lawsuit alleges.
It goes on to allege that Edwards was also taking Accutane, a powerful anti-acne drug, so that in November 2007—the month during which Edwards committed suicide—he was simultaneously taking Accutane, Adderall, Prozac, and Wellbutrin.
Accutane’s side effects include increased risk of depression and suicide, and both Prozac and Wellbutrin carry a “black box” label warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about increased risks of suicidal thoughts and behavior, according to the manufacturers’ and FDA’s Web sites.
Harvard spokesperson Kevin Galvin released the following e-mailed statement: “We understand how difficult it must be for John Edward’s [sic] family to cope with such a tragic loss, but we are confident that the care he received at Harvard University Health Services was thorough and appropriate and he was monitored closely by its physicians and allied health specialists. Similar complaints previously have been filed with the Board or [sic] Registration in Medicine, the Board of Registration in Nursing and the Board of Registration in Pharmacy, and in all three instances the complaints were dismissed upon review.”
Lisa G. Arrowood, the attorney representing Edwards, said that the drug combination is associated with an increased risk of suicide.
Arrowood declined to comment further and declined to comment on behalf of John B. Edwards II, Edwards’ father, who could not be reached for comment.
“John Edwards was given quite a brew, quite a combination of drugs,” said psychiatrist David M. Bear ’65, whose son was childhood friends with Edwards.
“I’m not saying it’s totally inappropriate, but it’s a combination most of us would want to watch very carefully under the care of a real expert,” added Bear, who has experience testifying in court as a forensic psychiatrist.
The complaint alleges that Cannon was Edwards’ primary care provider and that no physician provided proper supervision.
Bear said that a nurse practitioner should not have been supervising Edwards due to the complexity of the case and the number of drugs involved.
“Almost no one could disagree that a psychopharmacologist should have been overseeing all of this,” Bear said.
“If all this man got were those drugs and one talk from a psychologist, it falls below the standard of practice,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At some time between 10 p.m. and midnight on a predeterminded day of the week, Spring Greeney ’09 and her three housemates board their bikes and make the trek to a series of closed local grocery stores. They park their bikes behind the store, and open the side dumpster door.
Greeney said that most of the food worth salvaging is put into the dumpster last, so they only open a few bags on top before moving on to the next store. A good 45-minute trip will yield a duffle bag of pastries that the four of them can hardly finish in a week.
The lifestyle, referred to by its practitioners as “dumpstering”—not to be confused with “dumpster-diving”—involves scavenging grocery store dumpsters after hours for food that is still packaged and edible, Greeney explains. She and her housemates, who jokingly call themselves the “Hippo Commune,” mostly collect pies, tarts, cakes, and bread from trash bags they find at the top of dumpsters.
“I’ve never been in a dumpster,” she said. “I’m a little bit scared and nervous about it.”
Greeney made her first foray into the world of dumpstering only after moving in with her housemates in August, who she said make at least one trip to local dumpsters a week.
Since then she has only joined them on three occasions, but routinely eats the food they bring back to the apartment.
But Greeney took issue when a recent story in The Boston Globe called her a “freegan,” a term that has been used to describe an anti-consumerist lifestyle that includes tactics like “dumpster diving” and squatting.
“‘Freegan,’ to me, denotes a very radical, vocally critical individual who, similar to some members of the environmental movement, tends to be self-righteous in a way that turns a lot of people off,” she said. “I’ve always been fighting not to come across as a crazy radical. I do shower and shave and wear deodorant and eat meat.”
Greeney recognizes that the happenstance of her name, that she grew up in liberal Amherst, Mass., and that she concentrated in Environmental Science and Public Policy while at the College all make it difficult for her to claim that she is not a “radical environmentalist.” Greeney said that her brand of environmentalism is focused on people’s quality of life.
“I’m not interested in saving the whales, but I’m interested in people,” she said, “and would probably not dumpster if I stopped living with my current housemates.”
Currently, Greeney works at a state environmental office that focuses on the technological aspects of the environmental movement, but says that she aspires to effect change through cultural and educational reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With budget cuts looming over Harvard’s numerous libraries, more than a hundred faculty members signed off on an impassioned letter calling on top University administrators to increase funding for library acquisitions.
The letter, sent on Friday to University President Drew G. Faust, Provost Steven E. Hyman, and Faculty of Arts and Science Dean Michael D. Smith, follows a report released last month by a University Task Force suggesting that Harvard could no longer “harbor delusions of being a completely comprehensive collection.” The University will need to drastically restructure its “labyrinthine” library system in the face of budgetary pressure, the report said.
“The only good solution is to find ways to restore the acquisitions budget, making up not only for recent cuts, but for the past decade of cuts,” wrote co-authors English Professor Daniel G. Donoghue, Classics Professor Richard F. Thomas, and History of Art and Architecture Professor Jeffrey F. Hamburger.
Dan C. Hazen, head of acquisitions for Harvard College Library—the largest unit within the University’s decentralized library system—wrote in a report in June that over the past few years, “our efforts have been flagging already, to widespread consternation and alarm.” He wrote that those difficulties would be exacerbated this year by what he predicted to be a 15 percent drop in the acquisition budget.
HCL has sought to reduce its budget for 2010 by $12 million, even though expenditures have risen due to the falling dollar and increasing subscription prices. But the letter says Harvard’s libraries have been strained by a “period of neglect” stemming back to the 1990s.
The letter says that there is “much in the [Task Force] report that we can embrace”—it supports centralization of administrative functions, vendors, and information technology—but also outlines serious qualms.
The letter says that the report’s figures and graphs are “seriously misleading” in that they show a steady increase in acquisitions in recent years. But the graphs are distorted by “extra-ordinary” short-term cash infusions and fail to include the decline in funding over previous decades, the letter says.
The professors also raised concerns that cuts in acquisitions would diminish the standing of Harvard’s library collection among its peers. “It used to be taken for granted that our library had no peer,” Hamburger said.
Other signatories of the letter include University Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates, Jr., History Professor and Department Chair Lizabeth Cohen, and English Professor and Chair of the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies Marjorie Garber.
Humanities and History department faculty dominated the list of signatories, and only one member of a natural sciences department was listed. The authors said the letter’s distribution had been limited mainly to their colleagues.
“The purpose certainly wasn’t to pit the needs and concerns of colleagues in the humanities and social sciences against those of colleagues in the natural sciences,” Hamburger said. “We are all dependent on the library in any number of ways.”
FAS Dean Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement that “it is my firm belief that everyone at Harvard appreciates and understands the importance and value of our library system.”
Peter Machinist, a signatory of the letter and professor of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations, said that libraries are one of the three major components of the University, along with students and faculty.
“Without the library, Harvard would not be Harvard,” he said.

A fire broke out in a dormitory at Harvard Business School Thursday afternoon, causing an estimated $100,000 dollars in damage and displacing 83 students just days before final exams begin. According to a fire department spokesman, one firefighter was treated and released from the hospital with a shoulder injury, but no students were hurt.
Firefighters were dispatched to the scene at 2:14 p.m. Thursday, after hot exhaust from a generator escaped from a ventilation system and ignited insulation in the attic of McCulloch Hall, according to Boston Fire Department Spokesman Steve MacDonald. He said that roughly 35 firefighters responded and noted that the building’s sprinkler system was activated.
The students who live in the affected building—located on the east end of the HBS campus—are being temporarily housed in a dorm usually used for the Business School’s executive education program, which is currently out of session, according to HBS Spokesman Brian C. Kenny.
No external damage to the building was visible Friday afternoon, but some students who have been inside said damage appeared extensive in places.
“My room was the last room that was accessible,” said Dominic A. Charles, who entered the building to retrieve belongings Thursday. “The ceiling outside my friend’s room had just completely collapsed in the hallway.”
Students living in other parts of the building said the only damage they noticed ranged from waterlogged carpets to a “smoky smell.”
Kenny said that all students’ rooms were accessible by Friday afternoon. Around 3 p.m. on Friday, a few students were lined up to enter the building, escorted by maintenance workers in hard hats.
About two-thirds of the building’s residents should be able to return to their rooms by the middle of next week, Kenny said. Others who live in more severely affected parts of the building will not be able to return until January, after repair work is completed.
Kenny added that the school has given money to a few students whose belongings may have been ruined so that they can purchase necessities.
Amar Kumar, a student who lives in the building, complimented the HBS administration for their quick response to the fire. “They’ve been very communicative,” he said.
Kenny said that school officials believe that their response was effective, and that they are grateful for the positive outcome.
“We’re just glad there were no life-threatening injuries to anybody,” Kenny said. “It could’ve been much, much worse.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
The Undergraduate Council voted to censure outgoing UC Vice President Kia J. McLeod ’10 for her role in the controversial November presidential election.
McLeod sent an e-mail to the entire student body from the official UC presidential account which stated—in conjunction with "an underlying concern about the validity of the voting process"—that Vice President-elect Eric N. Hysen ’11 "might still have" access to the official voting software.
According to the censure resolution, which required 10 signatories to be brought to the general Council, McLeod “did knowingly abuse the power of her office” by collaborating with former UC Student Affairs Committee Chair Tamar Holoshitz ’10 and former UC presidential candidate Benjamin P. Schwartz ’10—both campaign staffers for former presidential candidate George J.J. Hayward ’11 and his running mate Felix M. Zhang’11—to send the “unsubstantiated e-mail” from the official ucpres@fas.harvard.edu address. Furthermore, the resolution stated that by “officially distributing biased viewpoints as fact and therefore severely damaging the reputation of the [UC]...[McLeod] did violate ethical standards.”
Chris W. Danello ’12, who as UC parliamentarian was the main advocate for censure, said during the hearing that the motion to censure—an expression of the Council’s formal disapproval of a member’s actions that carries no other consequences—was not a personal vendetta against McLeod but rather a “simple question” of upholding the rules of the UC.
In her address to the Council, McLeod, who is also a Crimson video editor, said that she was “truly sorry” for her actions, but argued against the passing of the censure. “I really do feel that I took actions to rectify the problems that I am personally comfortable with...I personally didn’t have any bad intentions, it was just a critique of the process,” she said. “I am really sad that this has come to the point that it is affecting our productivity.”
Though some Council members, such as Hayward, argued during the debate period that the UC should move on from the drama surrounding the presidential elections and direct its attention back to the “business of the council,” the censure motion—which requires a majority vote—passed 26-15-1 by secret ballot.
“You can’t move forward when something this big happened...this is the only thing that students were talking about this year” said former UC member Jon T. Staff V ’10, who attended the meeting as a visitor.
Also in response to this year’s election debacle, the UC passed legislation creating an Election Reform Task Force, which will propose reforms to the independent Election Commission by March 2010.
Flores said the recent election exposed deep flaws in the EC—which is responsible for administering UC elections. “We realize the process is messed up...it’s credibility has been attacked,” she said.
Until the reforms are adopted, the UC’s Executive Board will replace the EC and administer the small number of special elections for House representatives that will take place during shopping period next semester.
“This is a temporary measure,” said Leverett representative Luis A. Martinez ’12. “Once we have reforms, the EC will again assume a much better, more effective role.”
The Council passed a record 12 additional pieces of legislation last night. These acts included an expansion of the UC TKTS program—which lotteries free event tickets to students—to include events in Boston, and an initiative to improve the online student events calendar.

CORRECTION
An earlier version of the Dec. 7 news article "Undergraduate Council Votes to Censure VP After Election Scandal" incorrectly stated that an e-mail sent by Kia J. McLeod '10 alleged that Eric N. Hysen '11 had accessed the official voting software and tampered with the vote tally. In fact, McLeod merely wrote—in conjunction with "an underlying concern about the validity of the voting process"—that Hysen "might still have" access to the voting software.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day Billy M.K. Stallings ’10 proposed to Paul G. Nauert ’09, a large rainbow stretched across the Texas sky. The couple had driven up to Austin from Billy’s home in San Antonio, and they sat on the lawn in front of the capitol building, its pink granite glowing in the late afternoon sun.
“Paul Gregory Nauert,” Stallings began—and a nervous speech about commitment and gratitude spilled out to his boyfriend of the last four months.
“I knew at that moment,” Nauert recalls, “as bats were flying overhead and the stars were coming out, and then he said, ‘Will you marry me?’”
With the ring on Nauert’s finger, the newly engaged couple kissed as they sat on the lawn in front of the Texas capitol.
“Hey!” they heard suddenly. The two looked up at a group of men around their age. Austin was a more liberal part of Texas than most, but the two began to worry. They hadn’t encountered any homophobia until now in their time together—was their love going to be challenged the very night they got engaged? One of the men standing above them spoke.
“We were just going to play Ultimate Frisbee,” he said. “Would you like to join us?”
HERE COMES THE GROOM
The couple plans to marry in Memorial Church on May 28, 2010, the day after Stallings’ graduation.
“We had heard rumors about a twenty year wait list, stories about people getting married somewhere else but renewing their vows in Mem Church,” he says. Nevertheless, the couple was able to call the chaplain and set a date right away.
Stallings says his father is a reverend in the Progressive Catholic Church and will officiate the ceremony. Many of the couple’s friends have also offered their talent and support.
“I didn’t suspect that the wedding would bring out so much generosity,” Stallings says. Friends have offered to photograph and sing at the wedding, and the couple feels that the support is not unidirectional.
“A wedding is a commitment to the community,” Nauert explains. “The same-sex element enriches it with courage.”
Because they’re both from states with constitutional bans against gay marriage—Stallings hails from Texas and Nauert from Missouri—Massachusetts is one of the five states in which they can legally tie the knot. According to Sexton Richard D. Campbell, about 30 same-sex ceremonies have been performed in Memorial Church since gay marriage was legalized in Massachusetts in 2004.
Getting married in the state where they went to college—and on the campus itself—has a special significance to the couple.
“In falling in love with Billy, I fell in love with Harvard in a way I never could have imagined,” Nauert says. “Now there’s an archaeology of emotion that Harvard has for us.”
Excavating the site of their relationship reveals that, even though the couple only spent a few months together before getting engaged, the two have created a strong foundation for their future.
WEDDING BELLS ARE RINGING
“I think they’re perfectly matched,” says Stallings’ father, Reverend Larry D. Stallings. “They’re compatible, terribly interested in what the other is doing, and they promote each other’s interests. They’re talking about adopting children and having a family.”
He says he was impressed with the couple’s forethought, and adds that he had no doubts about the couple, even marrying so young.
“Maybe their journey seemed more natural to me than to others because it was so parallel to mine,” the father says. “I wanted to marry Billy’s mom the first week I met her, so as the next step in their relationship it seemed perfectly right to me.”
While the older Stallings waited a little more than a week to propose to Diane Kasser, the two have celebrated well over 30 anniversaries. Kasser is just as supportive of her son’s decision to get married.
“We feel that they’re mature, that they’re young in years but they can handle this,” she said. “They each put the other one first and give 100 percent to the relationship.”
The couple’s friends have also been supportive of the relationship, and agree that youth should not be a barrier to their marriage.
“People who say they’re too young don’t know them very well,” says Mariah A. Bush ’10, a close friend of the young couple’s and their official wedding photographer.
Megan A. Shutzer ’10, another friend who fully supports the couple’s decision, says that most people who know the couple well have reacted with enthusiasm—with one possible exception.
“I think my parents are disappointed because they love Billy and they wanted us to get married,” Shutzer jokes. “Every mom Billy has ever encountered is disappointed he’s not marrying their kid—he’s such a mom-pleaser.”
NOT A PIECE OF CAKE
But not everyone at Harvard has expressed the degree of enthusiasm shown by friends and family. Stallings and Nauert have encountered skepticism about their decision to marry so young, especially as they only began dating several months before the engagement.
“Most people at Harvard are focused on traditional forms of normative success and wouldn’t get engaged as undergraduates,” Stallings says. “It’s not even an issue even of being too young, but of jeopardizing chances of success. But I know I will certainly achieve my greatest success through being in love with him.”
The couple’s hopes and plans for the future have defied their peers’ skepticism. While they say they have been lucky to avoid encounters with homophobia and have been accepted and supported by most of the people closest to them, their greatest trial has been in their interactions with Nauert’s parents. Though they were relatively understanding when Nauert came out to them as bisexual before starting college, their reaction to his relationship with Stallings was less accepting.
“My parents were incredibly afraid of it when I first brought it up to them,” he said. After Nauert graduated from Harvard last spring, he and Stallings, who had been together for six weeks at that point, drove from Cambridge to St. Louis and spent a difficult few days in his family’s home. While the two were not engaged yet, it was clear that the seriousness of their commitment to each other bothered Nauert’s parents.
“The healing still hasn’t taken place, and there’s been no genuine recognition of the partnership,” Stallings adds.
While Nauert is on speaking terms with his parents, he spent Thanksgiving with the Stallings family and plans to spend Winter Break there as well.
“It was unclear how much is frustration with commitment, and how much is their inability to grasp that two people of the same sex are getting married,” Nauert says.
While the Nauerts have been more reluctant to recognize their son’s engagement, Paul says he hopes they will become more accepting in the future.
“Paul’s family really loves him and there’s a relationship to be salvaged there,” Shutzer says. “I hope they can see that in the excitement of the wedding.”
‘THE VOCATION OF LOVE’
The couple feels fortunate that aside from the conflict with Nauert’s family, which they attribute more to his parents’ worries about commitment than to homophobia, they have faced few other difficulties in being public with their same-sex relationship.
“We’re very lucky we haven’t been through the scarring things that shape much of the queer experience,” Nauert says.
“Homophobia is a channel for a lot of anger and selfishness,” Stallings adds. “One thing about Harvard is that homophobia is just not tolerated, because there’s no one here who’s going to validate it.”
They say they are glad to have met each other and fallen in love in a place that is so accepting, compared with much of the country. They also say that they believe they have a duty to help people less fortunate by joining the call for action.
“It is incumbent on people in our position and with our privilege to be as open as we can in every situation,” Stallings says. “Even holding hands as we walk down the street is an involuntary call to courage.”
The couple hopes to express their gratitude to the community—both their immediate friends and family and the American homosexual community as well—by sharing their love and giving back to those around them. As they both plan on attending law school, they hope to contribute to the formation of a centralized and organized strategy for gay rights advocacy, which they currently feel is lacking.
“They want to make the world a better place,” says Kasser, Stallings’ mother.
But wherever they end up, the two agree that their relationship will be the foundation of any choices that come along down the line.
“The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is Billy Stallings,” Nauert says. “I know that whatever vocation I arrive at it will be through the vocation of love, and whatever happens, we’ll be holding hands throughout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mather House Masters Sandra Naddaff and Leigh Hafrey announced in an e-mail to the Mather community at 9:30 Monday night that they will step down from the House’s helm at the end of this academic year.
“When we began mastering at Mather in 1993, we couldn't possibly have imagined the great adventure and deep pleasure that this work brings,” they wrote. “Over the past 18 years, we have experienced over and over again the uniqueness of Harvard's residential system, and the benefits it brings to all its members. It has been for us a privilege and a joy to live in this House and share its great spirit.”
Of the dozen sitting House Masters, Naddaff--who serves as chair of the Council of Masters and directs the Freshman Seminar Program--and Hafrey have  served the longest. Their son, Benjamin Naddaff-Hafrey '13, is a current freshman.
They are the third set of Masters to announce their impending departure in just under two weeks. Cabot House Masters Jay M. Harris and Cheryl L. Harris made their announcement on November 29, while Eliot House Masters Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted did so three days earlier.
House Master vacancies are filled by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. By the end of the year, she will have had to fill five of the 12 Houses' top slots during her two-year tenure, having filled Master positions in Pforzheimer and Winthrop Houses earlier in the calendar year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They say the third time’s a charm, and for the Harvard women’s hockey team Friday night, that couldn’t have been more true.
After losing two back-to-back games on the road against the University of Minnesota last season, the No. 9 Crimson (7-3-2, 6-3-0 ECAC) finally toppled the No. 2 Gophers (13-3-2, 9-2-1 WCHA), 1-0, on Friday night at Bright Hockey Center. Junior Liza Ryabkina, who wears jersey number three, scored the winning goal 33 seconds into the third period.
“It was just a quick one-timer,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “She was in the right place at the right time.”
It was Ryabkina’s second consecutive game-winning goal in just her second game this season after missing the first part of the year with a knee injury. She also scored the deciding goal in Harvard’s 3-2 win over Dartmouth last week.
“It feels absolutely amazing—there are no other words to describe it,” Ryabkina said. “We really wanted to win today, and we worked really hard for it.”
Senior goaltender Christina Kessler, who made 24 saves in the shutout, earned one of the biggest wins of her impressive career. The win was Kessler’s 62nd career victory—bringing her within one of Harvard’s all-time goalie wins record, held by Ali Boe ’06. It also pulled her ahead—for the time being—of former Wisconsin goalie Jessie Vetter for the NCAA career save percentage record at .9414.
“I’m not looking at how many saves I make, or how many wins I have,” Kessler said. “It’s all about our game and winning right now.”
After Minnesota won the opening faceoff, neither team recorded a shot on goal until nearly four minutes in, when Kessler deflected a shot by Gopher senior Kelli Blankenship. The Crimson got its first opportunity two minutes later, but Minnesota freshman goalie Noora Raty played spoiler to a shot from Ryabkina.
Harvard had an opportunity to score on a one-on-one fast break midway through the period, but freshman Jillian Dempsey missed wide.
With 3:43 remaining in the period, Harvard freshman defender Josephine Pucci was penalized for high sticking.
Coming into the game ranked sixth in the nation on the penalty kill, Harvard’s man-down unit continued its strong play, as Kessler made two nice kick saves off shots by Minnesota’s Brittany Francis and Kelly Seeler, and the defense held the Gophers off. At the end of the first period, Minnesota had taken nine shots, compared to just five for the Crimson.
“I think we played really well defensively,” Kessler said. “I think a lot of the shots were from the outside, and I saw them, [which] made my job a lot easier.”
The second period began with four-on-four play, and the opening minutes were fast-paced. Kessler made three saves in the opening two minutes of the period, and after another Gopher penalty, Harvard missed the chance to score when Dempsey couldn’t put a back-handed flick away after a great pass off a fast break.
Just a minute after that penalty expired, the Gophers again were sent to the box, but Minnesota remained aggressive offensively. Junior Emily West stole the puck in Harvard territory and almost pushed it in, and after Raty saved a Ryabkina slapshot, it took a diving stop by co-captain Kathryn Farni to thwart a fast break by Minnesota’s Chelsey Jones.
After more good goaltending on both sides, Crimson junior Kate Buesser missed an opportunity with 9:49 remaining, when her wide-open wrist shot from just outside the crease hit Raty in the chest.
The Crimson missed another opportunity to score with 7:42 remaining, when senior Anna McDonald missed wide and high after a break-away.
“I liked how our kids never backed down tonight,” Stone said. “They just stepped up and played very well.”
In the opening seconds of the third period, with a Harvard power play winding down, the Crimson finally broke through. Dempsey skated down the left baseline and pushed a cross to Ryabkina, who put the puck in the lower left corner of the net.
Harvard had opportunities to build on its lead after Ryabkina’s goal, but rookie Margaret Chute couldn’t capitalize on a fast break, and junior Deborah Conway missed an open shot after the Minnesota defender in front of her fell down.
With under a minute and a half left, the Gophers had their best chance to tie things up, but a fast-break shot by West lacked power and was saved by Kessler. Minnesota had the puck in Harvard territory in the final minute, but Kessler saved Megan Bozek’s wrist shot, and that was it for the Gophers.
It was the team’s fourth-consecutive win, and the Crimson’s first win over Minnesota since the 2003 NCAA semifinals. Harvard had not beaten a team from the WCHA—the conference that has turned out every NCAA women’s hockey champion—since a 4-0 win over Minnesota-Duluth three years ago.
“I think we’ve really come together,” Kessler said. “We struggled a little at the start defensively...[but] we’ve really settled down in our defensive zone and played very well.”
For Kessler, the shutout was especially impressive, considering the fact that Minnesota hadn’t been blanked since February 2007.
“It’s pretty high up there,” the goalie said of this game’s rank in her storied career. “One of the things we talked about as a team yesterday is that we don’t want to have an underdog mentality. We are as good as Minnesota, and this just proves we are a great team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two games. Two game-winning goals. At moments during the Harvard women’s hockey team’s 0-0 tie with No. 2 Minnesota (13-3-2) at Bright Hockey Center on Saturday, it looked like junior forward Liza Ryabkina would get a third.
“I wasn’t disappointed at all that I didn’t score,” Ryabkina said. “I’m disappointed that we didn’t score overall. It’s sad to end up with a tie when we should have won this game because our heart and effort were there.”
But though it was unable to put the puck in the net, the Crimson (7-3-2, 6-3 ECAC) twice shut out a Golden Gopher team that hadn’t been shut out since Nov. 17, 2007. Harvard goaltender Christina Kessler made 29 saves Saturday to follow up her 24-save effort Friday.
“It’s always a great feeling to finish a game with a shutout,” the senior said. “Defensively I thought we played really, really well.”
For all of Kessler’s dominance, her Gopher counterpart,  Noora Raty, had the tougher job Saturday afternoon, as the Crimson outshot Minnesota, 39-29. It was Harvard that took control of the puck early and repeatedly challenged the net.
“Team effort was incredible,” Ryabkina said. “Everyone was so excited to play both of these games.”
The Crimson doubled the Gophers’ shots in the first period, 14-7, but was unable to capitalize.
“We did control the puck a lot,” Ryabkina said. “But you know it’s a game, sometimes the pucks go in and sometimes they don’t.”
This season, not too many pucks have gotten past Raty, who came into the doubleheader with a 0.99 goals-against average.
The Minnesota freshman has been on the Finnish National Team since she was 15 and made 78 saves in the 2009 International Ice Hockey Federation World Championships to help Finland take bronze. Raty held off 14 shots from eight different players in the first period alone. The freshman’s net play gave her teammates time to adjust to the aggressive Crimson attack.
“We had plenty of chances,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Their goalie was tremendous.”
And it seemed that every time the Gophers took possession from the Crimson, it got a shot off shortly after. No matter where the turnover occurred, the puck somehow found its way to Minnesota forward Emily West, the nation’s seventh-leading point scorer. The junior lived up to expectations, always a threat with the puck and registering five shots on the night.
But Kessler was always there.
“Kessler did a great job,” Stone said. “We try to play stingy defense. We did it really well last night. We did it pretty well tonight.”
Stingy defense became crucial in the third period, when the Gophers finally outshot Harvard, 13-11. On the other end of the ice, the Crimson nearly got goals from freshman Kaitlin Spurling and junior Kate Buesser, the team’s leading scorer. But both shots missed the net.
Harvard was unable to capitalize on power plays, despite Minnesota senior Kelli Blankenship getting boxed for cross-checking at 4:59 into the third period. 70 seconds later, teammate Terra Rasmussen was called for hooking to give the Crimson a five-three advantage for 50 seconds. But the three Minnesota skaters packed in around the goal and prevented Harvard from penetrating, actually managing to take away the puck to set up a scoring opportunity of their own. Kessler made the save, falling to the ice in the process. A whistle was blown, and the senior recovered quickly.
Ryabkina, who took five shots in the second period, looked to find the back of the net again. Twice she was able to beat the Gopher defense, but neither ended in a tally for the Crimson. With around eight and a half minutes left in the game, the junior missed an open shot. Raty was able to get to her before she could register what would have been her second shot of the period.
“I just wanted to score because I knew how much everyone wanted to score,” the forward said. “Even though we didn’t find the back of the net in this game, we put a tremendous effort into it.”
Overtime gave the two teams one more chance to get on the board, but quick offsides calls for both teams set the tone for the five-minute period. Neither team would be able to mount much offense, and when the time expired, neither team would have a goal to its name.
The Gophers would board the plane back to the Twin Cities without having scored on a Crimson team that opened its season at 2-3-0.
“They’re getting better all the time,” Stone said of her team. “They’re able to ante up to whatever level we need to play at. For us, we need to set the pace at that intensity level every single time we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard co-captain J.P. O’Connor came to the 28th Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational looking for revenge.
He returns to Cambridge as the fifth tournament champion in Harvard history.
“He has a tremendous desire,” Crimson coach Jay Weiss said. “He pulls matches out because he’s a competitor, and you can’t teach that.”
Earning major decisions in his first three matches, the 157-pounder pulled out last-second 5-4 victories in the quarterfinals and semifinals against Jesse Dong of Virginia Tech and Chase Pami of Cal Poly. For the senior, the victory against Pami—ranked No. 2 in the country—was particularly rewarding.
O’Connor had beaten Pami twice in the regular season last year, including in Las Vegas, but the Cal Poly wrestler won on the big stage in March, knocking O’Connor out of the national tournament and denying him the chance to earn All-American status for a third year in a row.
“I’ve been waiting a little less than a year to get a little revenge,” O’Connor said.
The co-captain faced off against Boise State’s Adam Hall in the final, defeating him in a 2-1 tiebreaker.
“In the final, I didn’t wrestle as well as I wanted to,” the senior said. “I was a little timid. But I got my hand raised. I’ve been in the finals three times before. It’s nice to finally get a win.”
O’Connor came into the tournament ranked third in the country, and his coach expects him to move to the No. 2 ranking after his performance this weekend.
For the co-captain, the victory is part of a campaign to win the National Championship this coming March.
“I consider myself the best in my weight class,” he said. “I want to win the National Title. I’m incredibly confident this year.”
The senior hasn’t been beaten yet this season.
“I’m really proud of him,” sophomore Walter Peppelman said. “I couldn’t ask for a better workout partner.”
Peppelman made some waves of his own with a sixth-place finish in the 149-pound division.
“He’s incredibly tough,” O’Connor said. “He goes out with a certain determination, a fire in his eyes that maybe I didn’t see last year. I couldn’t be [prouder] of the way he wrestled.”
It was the first time the sophomore had placed in a tournament.
“I think the difference between last year and this year is that he’s got a lot of confidence,” O’Connor said. “He’s making his way to maybe being an All-American.”
Practicing against a two-time All-American can only help.
“I’ve gotten so much better,” Peppelman said. “Having [O’Connor] as a partner only makes you better.”
O’Connor and Peppelman headlined an otherwise disappointing outcome for the Crimson. None of the other wrestlers won a match.
“I was hoping for more,” Weiss said. “Some guys have to make a decision about how good they want to be...Some guys have to compete at a higher level. That’s what they’re supposed to do.”
Recent injuries have also plagued Harvard’s wrestlers. Freshman Steve Keith, who owns a 7-2 record at 125 pounds, and Harvard’s top heavyweight, senior Andrew Knapp, did not compete. Keith was felled earlier in the season after rolling his ankle, and Knapp has yet to see action due to a knee injury. His backup, sophomore Spencer DeSena, is also out with bronchitis.
Considering the number of grapplers unable to compete, the Crimson may welcome a long break. Heading into reading period and exams, Harvard won’t hit the mat in a competition again until Dec. 29. But for those who remain on top of their game, the break will signal plenty of hard work.
“School comes first: we’re going to study,” Peppelman said. “When we have free time, we’re going to come in and work out once or twice a day and try to correct the mistakes we made this weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
STORRS, CONN—Under head coach Tommy Amaker, the Crimson has had a knack for witnessing success as the underdog.
But against No. 13 UConn (6-1) in the school’s Gampel Pavilion yesterday, the Crimson (6-2) could not assert itself over the Huskies and lost a competitive game by a score of 79-73.
Despite a 16-point Husky advantage at one point, the possibility for a Harvard victory was not out of the question. With 3:22 to go in the final half, freshman Christian Webster sank two free-throws to bring the Crimson to within five at 67-62.
With UConn star Jerome Dyson stalling out and co-captain Jeremy Lin returning to the court, Harvard looked poised to make a dramatic victory run, but the Big East powerhouse held on to deny Amaker’s squad a third major upset in as many years.
“I was pleased with the great effort that we put forth here this afternoon,” Amaker said. “But certainly you need to play a flawless game to have chance to win a game against this kind of terrific opponent in their home environment.”
The second-half comeback was catalyzed by Lin, who sparked the rally by scoring six consecutive points in under a minute. Capping off his run with 11:30 to go, Lin surged down the middle of the court past Husky defenders and received a well-placed inbound from sophomore Keith Wright before leaping up and slamming the ball through the hoop.
“In the first half, I was a little nervous about everything, and I didn’t know how the game was going to go,” Lin said. “I got more aggressive as the game went on, and I felt more comfortable.”
Lin led all players with 30 points on only 18 attempts—in addition to tallying three assists, two blocks and three steals. After scoring only eight in the entire first half, Lin scored nine straight with the clock ticking down to tie his career high.
“For some folks who haven’t seen [Lin] play, you’re probably wowed by some of the things he can do–we are,” Amaker said.
“That’s the best complement I can give him, that what you saw this afternoon out of him is who he is. I think he’s as good of a guard as there is,” Amaker added.
“He’s one of the better kids, including Big East guards, who have come in here in quite some time,” UConn coach Jim Calhoun said.
Lin and the rest of the Crimson managed to keep pace with UConn shooting from the field, trailing the Huskies’ 42 percent shooting within the arch by only one percent.
Harvard could not maintain the tempo at the boards, though, as UConn reasserted itself in the paint during the second half and grabbed 27 total rebounds to the Crimson’s 14.
Although there was no blowout, an inconsistent but nonetheless intimidating UConn defense made its presence known. Frequently outmaneuvering Harvard, the Huskies were relentless at rebounding and kept up pressure on the Crimson from the inbound to the basket. UConn blocked Harvard shots 13 times and recovered well from turnovers.
The Huskies halted the Crimson twice following two Lin steals in under a minute; Dyson blocked freshman Brandyn Curry’s attempt at a lay-up before guard Kemba Walker muscled out a defensive rebound after the second steal.
Harvard encountered trouble finishing throughout the second, nabbing only one second-chance point relative to the 13 it accrued throughout the first half.
Part of the early success could be attributed to Harvard’s performance down low. Harvard kept up in the paint throughout the first half, generating 20 points and 23 rebounds relative to UConn’s 21 and 19. As has been the case throughout the season, the Crimson received large boosts from its bench; nonstarters generated 27 points on the day and ample substitutions kept Harvard fresh against UConn’s athletic starting line.
Offensively, the UConn backcourt wreaked havoc on the Crimson throughout the first half. Dyson and Walker combined for 28 points and six assists.
After halftime, Dyson’s pace was slowed as the star guard went 1-12, but his final stats—24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists—still demonstrate a clear dominance against Harvard.
“There’s a lesson in the loss,” Amaker said. “Sometimes we’ll find things that will help us get better down the road down the stretch. But we didn’t come here to hang around. We came here to see if we could compete and to see if we could scratch out a win.”
The Crimson will have its fair share of opportunities to apply that lesson as an underdog on the big stage in the near future, as it will challenge Boston College on Wednesday and Georgetown on Dec. 23.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than two minutes into the second half of the Harvard women’s basketball team’s 85-68 win against Boston University (3-4) at Lavieties Pavilion yesterday, the Crimson (5-3) found itself staring down a 41-30 deficit and a hot Terriers squad that was riding a 7-2 run to open the frame. With her team on the verge of completely losing control of the contest, Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith decided that it was time to make a statement.
“I thought we were sluggish, tired—no fight or intensity,” Delaney-Smith said. “[We had a] very slow start to the second half. That’s just wrong because we are a good team.”
Looking to start a fire in her squad, Delaney-Smith removed all of her starters from the game and sent her bench out onto the court.
“I don’t think the starters liked it when I pulled them all out that early,” the coach said.
The move worked. The Crimson reserves began to chip away at the BU lead, and when the starters returned three minutes later, the lesson had been learned.
Sophomore guard Brogan Berry converted a three-point play immediately after checking in and proceeded to lead Harvard on a relentless comeback effort.
Berry scored 11 of her game-high 19 points over the next six minutes, laying in the tying shot with 9:07 left in the game and then assisting Claire Wheeler’s three-pointer that put the Crimson up, 56-53.
“I think the comeback was sparked by the coaches,” Berry said. “We knew we were playing bad and that we needed to come together.”
Harvard’s resurgence was partly the product of Berry’s explosive performance and her teammates’ timely shots—such as a three-pointer from junior Jackie Alemany with 14:17 left in the half that cut a 10-point Terrier lead to seven and prevented BU from running the score up—but the Crimson comeback wouldn’t have been possible without improved play on the defensive end.
After BU exposed holes in Harvard’s zone, Delaney-Smith switched to man-to-man.
“They were killing our zone, and [we had] matchup issues in our man, but if we dug in, then there weren’t matchup issues, so we ended up liking our man,” Delaney-Smith said.
Behind its defense, the Crimson completely reversed the momentum of the game. Junior forward Emma Markley led Harvard with 10 rebounds in the game, while Alemany and Wheeler cleaned the glass with six and five, respectively. Alemany pickpocketed the Terriers to the tune of five steals, and five Crimson players recorded a block.
“BU came out hard, and we weren’t prepared,” Berry said. “In the first half and first five minutes [of the second half]...we didn’t come to play, but it really showed a lot of fight in our team that in the last 15 minutes, we played with tough defense and came together as a team.”
With its defense fortified, Harvard took to lighting up the scoreboard. After taking the lead with 8:22 left in the second half, the Crimson finished the contest on a 29-13 tear.
Alongside leading scorer Berry, Markley and junior Christine Matera posted 16 points apiece, and Wheeler contributed 14 of her own.
Harvard closed out the win, making BU the second local rival that the Crimson has beaten this season. The squad upset Boston College, 82-81, in its first game.
“This was such a good win,” Wheeler said.
“We’re trying to beat all the Boston teams and prove ourselves to be the best in area.”
But even in victory, Delaney-Smith was less than satisfied with her team’s performance.
“I guess if I look at the overall picture, a win is always good,” Delaney-Smith said.
“I would’ve thought we were closer to establishing an identity as a team but, after this game, I’m a little disappointed.”
Harvard is now 4-0 at home this season and has the chance to oust yet another Boston foe, Northeastern, on Wednesday in its final game before reading period.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although most of its athletes had yet to compete this year, Harvard’s track and field team didn’t miss a step as it opened the indoor season last weekend.
The Crimson stayed close to home at the Reggie Lewis Center on Saturday for the first annual Jay Carisella Track and Field Invitational, capping off the day with three individual wins and two IC4A qualifiers. Overall, the men’s and women’s squads boasted 21 top-six finishes on the day.
“It was a great performance,” co-captain Jack Brady said. “Normally this [first meet] is about shaking the rust off and getting back into the swing of competition…but we had a bunch of guys go out and run really great times.”
Sophomores Darcy Wilson and Stephen Gelonek posted the best efforts on the track, finishing first in the 3,000 meters and 55-meter dash, respectively. Harvard coach Jason Saretsky credited Wilson with a tremendous showing, considering that the middle-distance runner was overextended in the long race. Wilson’s time of 8:38.34 earned him the win by a slim 0.47 seconds.
Gelonek completed his race in just 6.47 seconds, a personal best for the second-year sprinter and good for an IC4A qualifying time.
“[Gelonek] was moving real quick,” co-captain Justin Grinstead said. “He was looking good during the race.”
Grinstead also ran well in his first competition, earning third at 800 meters, but it was his co-captain Brady that stepped up early in the season. The senior weight-thrower hurled a personal-best 17.85 meters, earning second place and an IC4A berth.
“At the first meet, you never know what’s going to happen,” Brady said. “You’ve got to be happy when you get a personal best. It shows that I’ve made progress and that I’m ahead of where I was at the end of last season.”
The entire squad seemed well prepared for competition, as a number of other Crimson athletes posted noteworthy results.
Junior Ablorde Ashigbi followed just behind Brady with a fourth-place finish in the weight throw, while freshmen Jared Squires and Weishen Mead finished third and fifth in the 1,000 meters and the mile, respectively. The 4 x 400 relay team also fared well, as the A entry placed fifth with a time of 3:25.38.
On the women’s side, Harvard demonstrated its depth with 13 top-six finishes. Junior Dina Emde led the pack, winning the high jump by clearing 1.67 meters. Her performance evoked the Crimson’s strong legacy in the event, following the graduation of four-time All-American Becky Christensen ’09.
“Dina Emde continued a great tradition in the high jump coming away with the win,” Saretksy said.
Sophomores Shannon Conway (400 meters) and Kim O’Donnell (800) finished second in their respective races, while junior Katrina Drayton doubled up on the day, taking third at 55 meters with a time of 7.34 seconds and sixth in the 200. Freshman Brianne Holland-Stergar also shouldered multiple events, finishing as runner-up in the shot put with a mark of 12.34 meters and earning sixth in the weight throw. Fellow rookies Meghan Ferreira and Shannon Watt enjoyed promising starts to their Harvard careers as well, taking third in the 55-meter hurdles and shot put, respectively.
“This meet definitely met our expectations in terms of getting a first competition under our belt,” Saretsky said. “[It’s important] especially for the freshmen, just to get a taste of what college track and field is all about.”
But enthusiasm for meaningful competition was not limited to newcomers. Such strong performances across all four classes indicated the squad’s anticipation of the indoor and outdoor seasons.
“We train all fall, and by this time everyone is ready to go,” Brady said. “There’s an excitement about moving forward and starting to compete, where we get to see the results of our work.”

It could have gone either way. With the 4-3 score favoring No. 6 Cornell (2-2, 1-2 Ivy), the No. 5 Harvard men’s squash team’s undefeated streak looked to be in jeopardy. Two tight matches later, freshman Jason Michas and senior Alex Lavoie allowed the Crimson to pull away with a 6-3 win.
“The 6-3 looks convincing, but it could have easily been 6-3 to either team,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “I think we outplayed and outperformed Cornell on the day and managed to get this win, but it could have easily turned Cornell’s way.”
For the Crimson, Saturday’s win not only continued its undefeated season, but allowed Harvard to prove its dominance against a team that has always provided a challenge.
“[Last year], we lost in the season to them, but we beat them in the National Playoffs,” said junior Richard Hill. “Coming into Saturday, we were confident we could come up with a big win, but we needed all nine players to step up.”
The weekend’s matchup against the Big Red had no impact on the national rankings, but it did help the Crimson raise its prominence in the squash world.
“It wouldn’t have mattered so much if we had lost in the end,” Michas said. “It would have put us into a different position going into Nationals, but winning showed a lot of other people who think they have the opportunity to beat Harvard that we are really here to stay.”
Junior J. Reed Enderson began the Crimson’s ultimate victory with a 3-0 win over Cornell’s Charlie Wagner at the No. 4 position, but the Big Red quickly tied the score after beating co-captain Frank Cohen.
No. 8 William Ahmed also lost to his opponent in a five game back-and-forth match, but Hill playing as the No. 2 easily handled his opponent to even the score, 2-2.
“We knew we were going to come up against very difficult approaches,” Hill said.
The pressure from Cornell continued as rookie Zeke Scherl fell at the No. 3 slot again, giving the Big Red a one-game lead, but No. 9 Alexander Ma came from behind to even back the score. Co-captain Colin West, Harvard’s top player who has yet to lose a game this season, picked off Alex Domenick to give the Crimson a shaky 4-3 lead.
Then came Michas and Lavoie’s wins.
“[Michas and Lavoie] were playing the two deciding matches at the same time,” Hill said. “They overcame the pressure of their opponents and came up big when we needed them the most.”
Michas began his match minutes before Lavoie but quickly fell in the first two games to Arjun Gupta, one of the top squash players in Canada.
“Jason’s opponent was a very tough player, very talented, great racquet work, but Jason stuck to his game,” Hill said. “He basically refused to give up. He fought for every point, and he came up with that victory in the end.”
“I didn’t really believe that I could win because he was just really doing a lot of stuff better than I was,” Michas said. “In the second game, I saw him keeling over a little bit, and I knew at that point I could go on and win the rest of the match mostly on my fitness and being able to last a little bit longer.”
With Gupta showing signs of fatigue going into the third game, Michas took control, finishing 11-6, 11-3, 11-9.
“It was probably his best squash victory, and he did it on the right day,” Bajwa said.
No. 7 Lavoie began his match with a little more power than Michas, winning both the first and third game, 12-10, but he lost his second and fourth games by identical scores of 5-11. Coming into the final points, Lavoie cruised to an 11-8 win, giving Harvard its 6-3 victory.
Going into winter break, Bajwa emphasized the need the Crimson to stay focused.
“I always say when you lose, be happy because you learned, you reflect on your loss and that makes you better,” he said. “But when you win, be cautious, because you’ve got to find out how you won or how you need to do it again. We’ve got to work as hard as we’ve been working since the season started, and we cannot now let the break take us back a step.”
With over a month until Harvard faces powerhouse Rochester, the Crimson will attempt to continue its momentum and undefeated status.
“We’re just going to carry over everything we’ve done up to this point and try to pull out some big wins,” Michas said. “Our win against Cornell shows that we are very capable of beating a lot of other teams, and that’s just what we are going to try to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It appears that the second-ranked Harvard women’s squash team (4-0, 3-0 Ivy) is not in the holiday spirit, demonstrated by the fact that it did not gift sixth-ranked Cornell women’s squash team (2-3, 0-3 Ivy) a single game on Saturday morning.
“We are a united team, helping each other out and working without complacency,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “Cornell was stronger than Dartmouth, but our girls were stronger than they played last week. They really raised their level, and that’s very nice to see.”
The Crimson defeated the Big Red in all 27 contests in its home opener, the second time this season Harvard has won all of the games played on a match day. The Crimson remains the only team in the top 10 that hasn’t suffered an individual match loss among teams active thus far in the campaign.
Freshman Laura Gemmell set the tone for the Crimson, as she came out strong, defeating Cornell’s Jaime Laird 11-2 before finishing her off in a sweep, 11-8, 11-7. The rest of her teammates followed suit. At the number two spot, last year’s freshman phenom, sophomore Nirasha Guruge, took care of dismissing her opponent in three simple victories, 11-6, 11-6, 11-4. Junior June Tiong defeated Big Red’s Liza Stokes in three increasingly difficult matches, 11-1, 11-6, 11-9.
The closest match of the day came at the No. 4 spot. Junior Alisha Mashruwala had little trouble winning the first two games 11-3 and 11-6 before facing stiff competition from Cornell’s Rebecca Hazell. Mashruwala held on to win the third set 13-11 after a cycling of points that almost saw Harvard drop a game. At the no. 8 spot, junior Bethan Williams had no trouble in seeing off Big Red’s Clare Berner, 11-4, 11-0, 11-2.
Freshman Natasha Kingshott continued the good play for the group of promising freshmen, only allowing Cornell’s Lauren Sachvie to score four points in each of her three wins. Kingshott has exceled at the No. 5 spot, and is one of three freshmen that have regularly held a spot in the top nine. Gemmell has thrived in the top spot while freshman Sarah Mumanachit also fared well in the no. 7 spot. Saturday was no different for Mumanachit, who beat her opponent 11-6, 11-7, 11-3.
“[The freshmen] have been performing really well thus far,” co-captain Johanna Snyder said.  “They’ve been on the courts everyday and working hard. They’ve shown a lot of maturity in these past matches, and they’re fighters. They put a lot of good effort into every match.”
Co-captains Katherine O’Donnell and Johanna Snyder took care of business at the No 6. and No. 9 spot respectively. O’Donnell defeated Big Red’s Maggie Remsen, 11-5, 11-4, 11-7, while Snyder tired out her opponent by the end, 11-4, 11-4, 11-1.
The team was without sophomore Emily Park once again, who is has been suffering from a strained back all season, after she appeared to be on the path to recovery.
“We’re trying to get her feeling better,” Bajwa said. “She still has a slight muscle strain in the back, so we don’t want her back too soon. We want her back in full force when she’s ready.”
Snyder commented on the team’s recent streak of wins, citing great team chemistry and talent as the main recipe for success.
“I was pretty sure from the beginning that we would play really well,” Snyder said.  “We are really deep this year as I’ve never seen before in my four years as a player. We have a really good atmosphere that keeps up the motivation. I know that we can dominate this season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team held its own this past weekend, taking home a solid fourth place finish at the elite Georgia Invitational.
The Crimson flew to the Bulldogs’ home pool in Athens, Ga. this past Friday to match up against three perennial swim powerhouses, including two top-10 teams.
Harvard finished the three-day contest with a score of 558 points, following No. 9 Georgia (1,374 points), No. 4 Florida (758 points), and Denver (743 points).
Freshman Owen Wurzbacher was the star of the meet for the Crimson, taking home Harvard’s only first-place individual event finish of the weekend.
Wurzbacher claimed the 100-yard breaststroke in 56.91, barely edging out Georgia’s Joe Redmon for a meet-best time.
“We were really pumped up about [Wurzbacher’s race],” freshman Greg Roop said.  “It gave us a little bit of momentum and got the ball rolling for the rest of the meet.”
While Wurzbacher’s victory was the only gold taken home by the Crimson, the Harvard men recorded several impressive finishes throughout the contest.
The Crimson started out the weekend strong, with a fifth-place finish in the 200-yard freestyle relay.
Freshman Brendan McIntee, Roop, sophomore Niall Janney, and senior Rick McKellar combined for a time of 1:25.94 in the event.
Harvard also placed fifth in the 200-yard medley relay, touching the wall in 1:34.84.
Wurzbacher, junior Douwe Yntema, sophomore Ross Ford, and McKellar made up the Crimson team.
Co-captain Alex Meyer claimed another fifth-place finish for Harvard in the 500-yard freestyle, with a time of 4:28.98. In addition, the Ithaca native, who is known for his impressive distance races, swam a personal-best in the 200-yard freestyle event as the only Harvard competitor to make the championship heat.
The Crimson recorded another fifth-place relay finish, this time in the 800-yard freestyle relay.  The team of Yntema, McIntee, sophomore Matt McLean, and senior Mason Brunnick combined for 6:50.26 in the event.
Harvard followed suit in the 400-yard freestyle relay, as the team of Janney, McLean, McIntee, and McKellar claimed fifth in the event. The Crimson swimmers touched the wall in 3:06.88.
Wurzbacher earned additional points for Harvard in the 200-yard breaststroke.  The sophomore broke the Crimson’s fifth-place trend, finishing fourth in the event with a time of 2:05.90.
Junior Zac Ranta and freshman Michael Stanton rounded out the Georgia Invitational for Harvard. Ranta placed fourth in the 1-meter diving event with 288.65 points, and Stanton took home fifth in platform diving with 250.65 points.
The Crimson was pleased with its ability to compete against some of the best swimming and diving teams in the nation.
“There’s a lot of better swimming out there, so it’s good to get out of the Ivy League once in a while,” said Meyer.
The Georgia Invitational is Harvard’s penultimate non-Ivy League competition, with a dual meet with the cross-town rival Boston University scheduled for January.
In addition to the advantages of facing high-caliber national contenders this week, the Harvard swimmers and divers are now better able to gauge areas for needed work before the Crimson’s next competition.
“There’s definitely a lot of areas we could improve in,” said Roop. “[The Georgia Invitational] gave us a good idea of what we need to do to improve for the rest of the season and get ready for the Ivy League championship.”
Harvard will attempt to use what it learned this past weekend in Georgia to defend its current undefeated Ivy League record when it returns after a month-long break to go head-to-head with the Quakers of Penn.

In case it ever crossed your mind, this flyer, posted on the men's bathroom doors in Matthews North last Thursday, tells you why you shouldn't.
"Masturbation in the bathrooms is a Harvard University Honor Code Violation," the flyer reads. "Pipes in the residences are not meant to handle semen. Semen-related costs run into the thousands every year. Please masturbate in your own rooms."
Good to know.

Christmas spirit seeped into  every nook and cranny of Kirkland House this past week as students went  out of their way to make their Secret Santa recipient’s dreams come true. With  the floods of emails over Kirkland List thanking their Secret Santas,  you start to wonder if the real Santa Claus was ever this good.
Check out some highlights of this year's Secret Santa season after the jump.

Snow. Christmas. Finals. Caffeine abuse. It's that wonderful time of the year, when festive feelings and familiar traditions abound (maybe). The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra feels no less celebratory, but the group decided to put a unique spin on a timeless custom.
This year, the HRO leadership has opted to use a politically-correct, alternative moniker for that age-old tradition known as "Secret Santa." The festivities will now be called 'Super Sexy Secret Secular Santa,' according to HRO percussionist Elizabeth C. Bloom '12.
Since a ten-dollar limit was imposed on all gifts, students were encouraged to be creative in their searches for the perfect (cheap) gift, said Bloom, who gave her lucky target a photoshopped picture. One student was given, well, a box of tissues—perhaps the fact that his Super Sexy Secret Secular Santa is competing against him for a leadership position sheds some light on that particular transaction.
To guarantee anonymity of the givers, the gifts were placed on the chairs of their recipients before rehearsal one evening, Bloom added.
In addition, around this time of the season every year, the spirit chair of the orchestra sends out an e-mail written many years ago by a student whose Secret Santa had cruelly neglected to buy him a gift, according to Bloom.
The e-mail, Bloom said, serves to encourage students to participate in the general mirth and merriment of the holidays.
Here's to a super sexy, not-so-secret, maybe secular holiday season!

We love Mather's vibrant House community, but some might argue that the House (with its concrete aesthetic) looks kind of crappy on the outside.  Well, now it appears to be crappy on the inside too.
We got wind that students threw feces down the stairs of Mather House’s B entryway, presumably making it smell worse than Lamont Library after live-in students stay there for more than a week before finals. And presumably making its floor sticker than the floor at [insert where you were Friday night].
Mather resident Vernon Wu '12 warned fellow Mather residents Friday evening in an e-mail sent over the House open list:
“Someone has left a trail of feces in B entryway staircase so do not touch the banister as you use it," he wrote. "Especially be careful on the first flr [sic] as it seems like someone threw it down from the top of the staircase."
As co-masters of Mather House said Saturday afternoon in an e-mail to Mather residents: “one or more pranksters were at work in B entry last evening.” We at FlyBy think those pranksters must have been “at work” a little earlier, too…

Dude. Seriously? The Mather House Masters just announced about 40 minutes ago that they'll be stepping down at the end of this academic year.  First Eliot, then Cabot, and now Mather?  What on earth is going on?
