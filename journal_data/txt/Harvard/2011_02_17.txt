After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the editors:
I am writing to lend my voice to the chorus of those who oppose the views expressed by The Crimson editorial board in the recent editorial “Rethinking Privacy,” published on Feb. 11. The issue concerns the Cambridge City Council’s resolution that the City Manager appoint appropriate city staff, including the City Solicitor, to work with the Cambridge GLBT Commission to create a city-wide ordinance on gender-neutral restrooms.
Evidence abounds that as a group, transgender people and others who are gender non-conforming have suffered rampant discrimination in public accommodations such as public restrooms. In the results of a recently released study of more than 6,000 transgender individuals, the National  Center for Transgender Equality reported that 63 percent of respondents had experienced a “serious act of discrimination that would have a major impact on a person’s quality of life.” Cambridge’s visionary efforts to counteract this very real form of anti-transgender discrimination are thus truly laudable.
Contrary to the editorial’s position, there is no evidence that allocation of gender neutral restrooms results in an increased risk of sexual violence for women. The Harvard College Women’s Center affirms the right of all to access safe restrooms, and as a gender-inclusive center, we encourage all members of our community to bring us any concerns or ideas they have about this or any other gender issue.

To the editors:
It might be helpful to define “gender-neutral bathroom,” before concluding that “gender-neutral bathrooms would most likely create more issues than [they solve].” A gender-neutral bathroom, simply, is a single-stall bathroom that’s open to individuals of any gender.
I fail to understand how a modest smattering of such single-stall bathrooms across campus increases the risk of sexual harassment or sexual assault, or even the perception of increased risk. By this logic, Harvard should convert existing single-stall bathrooms into janitor closets. Do you advocate that, too?
In support of your opinion, you cite, without contrary evidence, language from the Massachusetts Family Institute, an organization which also believes as a core principle that “all sex outside of heterosexual marriage is detrimental to families and that includes homosexuality.” Do you advocate that, too?
You do seem to recognize how important it is for transgender students to feel comfortable in their own spaces. After all, you recognize that transgender students can live in rooms with en suite bathrooms. Surely they can return to their dorm rooms every time that they feel the urge. Do you advocate that, too?
There are not many students on campus who are gender non-conforming; this much is true. But for those few, a few thoughtfully located single-stall bathrooms significantly add to one’s personal comfort and safety.

To the editors:
The editorial is shameful for suggesting that dignity and access to facilities for a basic human need should be allocated based on what body type, clothes, and other gendered qualities the Crimson Editorial Board has subjectively deemed as acceptable to have. Inclusion is about valuing each and any gender and gender expression as fundamentally valid, legitimate aspects of one’s constructed and inherited cultural, social and biological identity.
The move toward creating gender-neutral facilities represents the expansion of the basic rights to safety, access, and comfort to individuals of all genders and gender expressions. The creation of additional bathrooms with the gender-neutral option does not displace current restroom options. The laudable point of gender-neutral bathrooms is that they represent a step in the direction of full gender inclusion. For individuals for whom the regulated gender expressions demanded of sex-segregated bathrooms have caused discrimination, discomfort, and shame, gender-neutral bathrooms provide the safe and accessible facilities that people of other genders already have. It’s about time.

To the editors:
As one of these “very few transgender, intersex, and non-gender identified students at Harvard,” briefly mentioned in the staff editorial “Rethinking Privacy” published on Feb. 11, I have a few thoughts on the conclusions drawn by The Crimson’s editors. I think it would have been preferable if some of these thoughts could have been shared before the article was written, whether by me or by another trans or gender-queer person, but I understand if we were too difficult to find.
First of all, as noted by comments posted online, the existence of gender-neutral bathrooms does not mandate the use of gender-neutral bathrooms. If you’re not comfortable with it, walk into a door with a suit or a dress on it. Maybe I’m misinformed, but unless this city initiative is a lot more radical than it appears, all of those “normal” bathrooms aren’t going to disappear overnight.  And I personally don’t want them to disappear, either. From all the public restroom discomfort I’ve experienced, I certainly wouldn’t want to make that a reality for all the cisgender folks out there who like their designated spaces.
As for why gender neutral bathrooms are important to me, it’s a matter of feeling comfortable when my private excretory practices simply must be taken care of in public spaces. As things are now, I keep close tabs on bathrooms that are low-traffic or single-stall. I will sometimes walk to Canaday from class to use the gender-neutral bathrooms in the basement. There are always the “private en-suite bathrooms” in the dorms, where the Crimson editorial board would clearly prefer for me to take care of my business, but I think we can all agree that sometimes one just can’t hold it all the way home. And I’m not just talking about my comfort here. What about the discomfort of the women who hear “Trust me, I’d pee standing up if I could,” when they inform me that I’ve accidentally walked into the ladies room? Or, what’s more often the case, the discomfort of the women who don’t say anything at all and shuffle out, maybe fearing that they’ve narrowly escaped a case of the public restroom sexual assault that the Crimson article is concerned with?
As a final note, stepping back from the debate at hand, I’d like to express my surprise and appreciation that the issue of gender-neutral bathrooms is even on the table. It’s not an obvious thing, and administrations like the Cambridge City Council and that of Harvard are clearly making a deliberate effort to enact changes that take everyone’s concerns into consideration, not just those of the majority.

To the editors:
I am writing in anger at your ignorant editorial, “Rethinking Privacy,” which argued that the University should not implement gender-neutral bathrooms because doing so would promote sexual assault.  I have a number of problems with the editorial.
First of all, you argue, without citing a single statistic, that “the risk of sexual assault is simply too high.” On the contrary, the Transgender Law  Center states that San Francisco Police have not received a single report of assaults on cisgender (i.e., non-transgender) women in public gender-neutral bathrooms.
Secondly, The Crimson did not contact QSA, the Trans Task Force, or University administrators to support their hollow claim that “there are very few transgender, intersex, and non-gender identified students.”  I can only conclude that you thought of your friends, and failed to recognize any trans people among their ranks.
Finally, The Crimson’s recommendations would result in bad University policy.  They don’t address the issue of what their policy means for library bathrooms or bathrooms in the Science Center. Do you really believe that the only safe space for trans students is, and should be, in their bedrooms?
As a bisexual woman who has dated, partied, played sports, and studied with trans students at Harvard and in the wider world, I am disgusted by the faulty reasoning and insensitivity that underlie the editorial.
In the 1950s, segregationists used faulty arguments about sexual assault to justify racial segregation. In the 1980s, radical conservatives used faulty arguments about the imagined horrors of gender-neutral bathrooms to defeat legislation that would have made gender discrimination, like racial discrimination, illegal in America.
Is Phyllis Schlafly comping the Crimson? If so, I hope she fails the comp.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I always listened to what my parents told me to do—until I was about nine. After that age, as most do, I adopted an ability to think critically, independently, and creatively. One would hope that members of national governments would be able to do the same.
Sadly, many members of the Indian government fail to have grown up. Indeed, much of the Parliament today—at the national and state level—is seeing a strong dynastic trend that is corroding the largest democracy in the world and appears to be a sad carryover of the obsolete caste culture.
This generation of monarchial political leaders is currently led by the fourth-generation heir of the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty, Rahul Gandhi. Gandhi’s family has captained the governing Congress Party for nearly 60 years and has ruled India for the better part of the last century. Each generation’s successor has held the highest governing position of prime minister. Many other political children, however, are the only two or three generations into the job.
But this passage of democratically elected positions is absurd. The Indian government is stripping itself of any level of creativity by choosing to elect its leaders from such a small pool. Moreover, these elections only serve as a structural maintenance of the former caste system that used to determine professions in the country. As a result of this approbation on caste society in India, there is a sense of entitlement among Indian politicians who appear to treat politics simply as an occupation, taking kickbacks and enjoying corrupt under-the-table money.
Most destructively, this nepotistic entitlement has promoted “self-interest above public interest,” as one Times of India editorial determined. Rahul Gandhi himself even recognized that “the Gandhi name gives one an unfair advantage,” encouraging others to join politics to take “that edge away.” But in a governmental system where crime and policy are intertwined—14 percent of the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of Parliament, have serious criminal charges against them—where is that capacity to intercept the institution and take that edge away? When those in power control seek to maintain their advantage, it becomes difficult to change the status quo.
All countries have political families. But India’s Parliament has transformed, as Patrick French has written in his book “India: a Portrait,” from a Lok Sabha, a “People’s Parliament,” to a Varsha Sabha, “A Parliament of Royalty.” Although it is the world’s largest democracy in terms of population, India may soon be unable to consider itself a working democracy if this trend does not abate.
Already, we are seeing that the ruling Congress party no longer holds the same level of control that the party once held under Nehru’s reign. The party, which once won elections with 72 percent of the popular vote, has now diminished to a mere 28.55 percent approval rating in the most recent 2009 elections. And while this decrease in popular support is the result of the proliferation of more parties, diluting the party’s national presence, this decline is significant—and represents poor party management.
Most troublingly, however, this decline in voter confidence in the Indian National Congress Party shows a larger concern: the majority of Indians are not necessarily approving of the trajectory of the party. Indian citizens have shown some significant concern in the lack of even policy-speak that Rahul Gandhi has engaged. But the system is self-folding, and even though voters may not believe in the dynastic succession that Rahul Gandhi has enjoyed, the institution allows for few other permutations. The only solution is to have these privileged few understand the privilege they are afforded—and to cast it away. They must step down and away from the family business of politics, to allow outsiders to question the validity of the current political system.
When Mahatama Gandhi (not related to Rahul Gandhi) wrested India’s freedom from British colonization, he also fought for equality across castes. The leadership of the nation has now returned to an earlier template of monarchial government—and citizens should more actively fight to restore the government that the country’s founding fathers imagined.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are few things more basic than using the bathroom.  We may gloss over it or laugh at it in conversation, but no matter who we are, how we look, or what we call ourselves, we all depend on that resource to get through the day.
For many people—including many Harvard students—this simple activity is fraught with challenges.  Last week’s Crimson editorial completely overlooked these challenges, ignoring that gender-neutral bathrooms are a matter of dignity and safety for those in our community who don’t conform to traditional gender norms. At the same time, The Crimson treated unsubstantiated risks of sexual harassment and assault against women as though they were facts, without offering any evidence for their claims.
In fact, non-gender-conforming individuals are the ones who have reason to fear physical harm when they go to the restroom. A large-scale study by the San Francisco Human Rights Commission found that transgender people were frequently chased by security guards or physically assaulted for “being in the wrong bathroom.” The harassment is so severe and regular that many even avoid drinking water in public places, which can lead to dehydration and problems with the urinary tract. Nor are these problems exclusive to transgender people. Men and women who look or dress differently than gender expectations would have them look also face difficulty, ranging from demeaning stares to explicit threats.
Gender-neutral bathrooms can reduce these risks by providing facilities where none of us are subject to scrutiny. We all shuttle between classes and extracurricular activities, so it’s unrealistic and unfair to limit the number of restrooms some of our peers can use.
More than 150 college campuses already have gender-neutral bathrooms–Oberlin has at least one in every residence hall, and many Yale dorms have multi-stall ones. At these schools, most students hardly notice the change. One female Oberlin student said, “I wasn’t completely sold on the idea…but they turned out not to be an issue for me. The toilet stalls (of course) lock, and the shower curtains (of course) go all the away across….” In fact, Oberlin students vote each year on whether their hall restrooms will be gender-neutral—and most of them say yes. If Oberlin—and especially Yale—can live comfortably with gender-neutral bathrooms, we can too.  As it happens, with the more-than 90 such restrooms Harvard currently has, we already do.
Some suggest that gender-neutral bathrooms put women at high risk of sexual assault. We should always take questions of safety very seriously, but there is no evidence to suggest this claim is true. The San Francisco Police has not recorded any instances of assault in gender-neutral bathrooms, and neither has Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response. “Rather,” their director adds, “the message the availability of these bathrooms sends to the campus is the inclusive atmosphere OSAPR supports.” The assumption that gender-specific bathrooms protect women is itself faulty.  Bathroom signs do not stop those who want to harm women from entering; they create the dangerous illusion that there is protection.  For issues of safety, we must look to our campus police, and to the environment our community creates.
In many ways, that environment would be better with more gender-neutral bathrooms. Our campus has many families among students, tutors, and staff, who would appreciate being able to assist their children in the restroom regardless of gender.  Disabled people with different-gender caretakers would also have an easier time.  Plus, it’s sometimes just easier not having to worry about the gender of a restroom–like when you’re in Lamont and have to climb a flight of stairs to relieve yourself.
Harvard has made a commitment to ensure the safety of its students, regardless of their gender identity.  Gender-neutral bathrooms are an important step towards meeting that commitment, and a responsibility Harvard must assume more proactively in both existing buildings and future construction. Equal access to safe and comfortable restrooms should not be based on numbers—low visibility of gender non-conforming folks on campus is a symptom of this need, not a justification for continued lack of access. All of us all should be able to use a bathroom, stress-free.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The oldest stationery store in Harvard   Square will close its doors next month after 78 years of service to the Harvard community.
Bob Slate’s closing is unavoidably sad as, once again, we watch the Harvard Square of yore lose the game of musical chairs where the music stops when the rent is too high. But as much as this cycle is often unfortunate, it is also inevitable. And we feel that, in the long run, it might even be beneficial, even when institutions as deeply rooted as Bob Slate are forced to close. Looking beyond our nostalgia for a beloved local fixture, we have to remember the nature of this particular establishment—a relatively expensive curiosity shop whose high prices could not compete with student demand for cheap goods.
In our view, the closing of Bob Slate is a sign of a Harvard Square that is more functional for students and better tailored to their needs, not to those of tourists or of past generations that knew a Harvard none of us will ever know. If, as we believe it must, Harvard   Square is to serve as a college town, current undergraduate demand should determine which establishments survive and which do not in the expensive storefronts of Massachusetts   Avenue.
To be sure, we do not by any means intend to celebrate the disappearance of the sort of local specialty store that gives Harvard Square its unique character. Harvard Square has always been a haven for the creative and the intellectual, and so it should remain. But, in our view, Bob Slate was a special case: not only was it unaffordable for many students, its hallmark item—stationery—suffers as an industry as much as the business itself. In this day and age, it seems safe to say that very few students even use stationery anymore, and other school supplies can be found elsewhere for cheaper. As much as we regret to see 78 years of a family business fade away, Bob Slate is a relic of the past more attuned to the needs of past generations of Harvard students.
In this sense, the demise of Bob Slate does not symbolize the death of the local store in Harvard Square. Rather, it seems to indicate that certain business niches are—in an age of subsidized chain stores—replaceable, and the ones that can compete are becoming smaller and more specialized. As much as Bob Slate ultimately could not compete with a bargain store like Staples, we cannot imagine any equivalent that might undercut certain Harvard Square staples such as Grolier Poetry Shop or Leavitt & Peirce Tobacco. These institutions combine their unique charm with irreplaceable goods and services that are relevant to students of any generation. As much as we regret it, stationery no longer seems among these goods.
Gone but not forgotten, Bob Slate has inscribed itself in our memories as a reminder of the beauty of the written word. Its closing should warn us yet again that we cannot let our appreciation for the epistolary arts die completely in the age of Gmail. But we should consider its passing not as a dead-end but as an inevitable step toward a newer Harvard Square that caters more to the needs of the current student body rather than to the select few who regularly purchased the beautiful handiwork of a plagued industry.
Despite the healthfulness of change, we nevertheless believe that the new direction of Harvard Square should still reflect the aesthetic and intellectual idiosyncrasies that have given the Square its character for past generations. Harvard may be an institution that coevolves internally with modernity, but we cannot toss antiquity to the wind when our institution is older than the country that houses us.
If the modus operandi is indeed “out with the old and in with the new,” we believe that the new tenants of Bob Slate’s storefronts should respect the local aesthetic when making any changes in an effort to maintain the Square’s uniqueness.
They, as much as we, owe it to Bob Slate to do so.

Presidents’ Day weekend is a timeless occasion to celebrate everything we love about our commanders-in-chief: cherry trees, adulteries, and groups of threes. Here’s a president-themed playlist freshly plucked from the dusty FM music room:
Devo: “Whip It”
Contrary to popular belief, “Whip It” is not about S&M: it’s about Jimmy Carter’s foreign policy. “We were thinking the song was kind of a Dale Carnegie, ‘You can do it, Mr. President!’ pull it together type of song.” Alright, fellas, ‘go win friends and influence people.’
Young Jeezy ft. Nas: “My President iz Black”
FM didn’t really understand this one, but we have complete faith in Jeezy le Jeune that, uh, this’ll be the realest shit we ever quote.
James Brown: “Funky President (People It’s Bad)”
The godfather of funk celebrated Gerald Ford’s inauguration with this strange collection of inspiring messages. Brown also seems quite sure that he needs to be both governor and mayor, but we won’t hold it against him.
The Presidents of the United States of America: “My Date with the President’s Daughter”
Back off, boys. Malia Ann is way out of your league. Cute Disney flick, though.
Mr. President: “Coco Jamboo”

La Creperie/Arrow Street Crepes was never able to decide on one name. Now, it has abandoned both, in favor of a new incarnation. The Mass. Ave. institution closed shop in December due to financial difficulties after serving the Harvard Square community for a dozen years, but crepe lovers and HUHDS detractors can find solace down the street.
Jim “Jimmy” Murray, former Creperie owner, and Aaron M. Siegel moved two blocks down the street and launched a new project: Canteen.
Located at 983 Mass. Ave., a leisurely stroll from their old storefront at 1154, Canteen is still convenient for Harvard students, and its owners hope to keep a connection to the University. “We know how important Harvard students are to our business, and we want to show appreciation for their loyalty,” Murray assured FM.
Murray plans to bring special music nights to Canteen and offer deep student discounts. He has been talking to the Harvard Student Agency to set up these deals. They are already implementing changes to appeal to this demographic, such as moving their closing hours from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m., and lowering the price of crepes.
To appease La Creperie enthusiasts, Murray has brought 85 percent of the popular menu from La Creperie to Canteen.
However, Murray emphasizes that his new venture has a personality all its own: a slow food dining experience and a push toward sustainability. Murray and Siegel are implementing green measures in hopes of attaining Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, consisting of buying local ingredients and other initiatives.
While they may have had difficulty sticking with a name and a location, according to Murray, they’ve kept one thing the same: “We’re foodies.”

Suit jackets! Suit pants! Pantsuits! Seemingly crawling out of the cracks in Dunster’s walls, Harvard’s men and women are showing up en masse for recruiting season, and they’re dressed for the occasion. But how many of those pre-professional guys and gals are actually just jumping on the fashion bandwagon? Here’s a list of the most common reasons Harvard students are wearing business attire these days.
1. Themed Party: Sec’s and Exec’s.
2. Trying to throw off unsuspecting Harvard students while waiting on the corner of Mt. Auburn and Holyoke St. at around 3:27 a.m. to mug, rob, maim, or otherwise assault them.
3. Making their Unmarked Van Shuttle Service seem more professional, so more people will take advantage of this convenient new transportation option to the quad.
4. They ran out of DHA sweatshirt and sweatpants combos and all of the washing machines were taken.
5. It just suits their fancy.
6. ... I’m pretty sure they’re following me. Holyshitholyshitholyshit.
7. Dressed to impress, on the off-chance they run into Mankiw and get hired as his protégée.
8. They watch too much “How I Met Your Mother.”
9. Just another Friday night. They are on their way to Bank of America now to scout for their future in I-banking. Up next: Citizens Bank! Then: Felipe’s!
10. Trying to hide secret identity from supervillains who would otherwise ruin their bitchin’ social life.
11. Heading to the Pit, just to chill with some friends (or for some good ol’ fashioned gang warfare—Harvard vs. Hipsters).
12. Their other suit is at the dry cleaners, so they had to wear one of their spares.
13. They’re trying to impress their hot TF (because clearly their grades won’t impress anyone).

Hi, I’m Peter, and I’m a gamer.
Phew. That was pretty difficult to say.
I’ve always been a little ashamed of being a gamer. Out of all the labels one could be given in high school, geek, nerd, and spaz were amongst the least desirable. I had a reputation to maintain, and as much as I wanted to discuss the intricacies of the one-handed waraxe in “Dungeons & Dragons’” fourth edition with my varsity football chums, I somehow always refrained. I’ve been a closet gamer as long as I have been able to roll dice.
And so were most of my closest friends. Yet, when far away from the judgmental eyes of high school, we would break out the dice, the cards, the joysticks and the cartridges, and gather in our usual basement of choice and get down to gaming. While most people generally stick to one type of game, we were constantly changing our medium. The term “gamer” historically has referred to people who played role-playing games, but recently it has come to encompass those of us, like me, who spend most of their free time playing and learning about all types of games. We knew our way around an Xbox, had a vast collection of board games, dabbled in poker and bridge, and knew about every trading card game that mattered.
Gamers tend to become friends very quickly, and the glue that held my friends together was one game in particular—
“Magic: The Gathering.” Magic, the oldest and most popular trading card game, can be described as a mixture of chess, poker, and bridge all wrapped up into a fantasy setting. I was introduced to the game when I was 10, and since then I have met my closest friends because of Magic. Magic players can immediately engage in a conversation with any other Magic player they ever meet, and because of the constantly changing nature of the game, the conversations never grow stale. My Magic encounters involve elves, goblins, battling with creatures, and casting and countering spells, which are often deemed “too awkward” to talk about with non-gamers. So my spells stayed locked away in the basement, only to emerge when the coast was clear.
But I am Peter, a gamer. I am no longer afraid. I don’t fit into the stereotype that society has created for gamers (thanks, “World of Warcraft”). I have friends, I am not overweight, I don’t live in my mom’s basement, and I shower regularly.
I look back at my apprehension of being outted as a gamer in high school, and I wonder how I could have been so naïve. I have since learned to embrace what I love and what games offer people. For me, I love engaging in strategic interactions, solving problems on the fly, and the competition that arises from two people fighting over a common goal. But what I get out of playing a game may be completely different than someone else, which is why so many people enjoy playing them.
Games offer a momentary escape from reality, where instead of the plethora of life problems that demand attention for most of the day, one can put those aside and focus on a completely different goal. Some folks thrive off the mental stimulation that word games and puzzles provide. Some get a kick out of mindlessly addictive pursuits to pass the time (read: “Farmville”), and others still seek to play games as an outlet for their competitive side. Games offer moments of personal triumph over difficult tasks, a sense of exploration in finding out dominant strategies, an outlet for relaxation, and most importantly, a source of amusement.
While I am not proud of the fact that I led two lives for most of my existence, the process was a learning experience. Accepting one’s interests and motivations is a struggle that many people have to go through. I like games, and think that everyone could be better off by playing more of them. If I have my way, I’ll be creating fun and addicting games until I can’t anymore.
The truth is, every person in the world is a gamer in some way or another. One would be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t played Monopoly or chess, or a student in college who hasn’t engaged in a game of Beruit, or any person in the U.S. under the age of 30 who hasn’t picked up a video game controller. And aren’t athletes simply gamers imbued with dexterity and physical prowess? Going beyond the explicit examples, people instinctively make games out of the most mundane of tasks. Grocery shopping is a video game where one is trying to locate the items on a list. Choosing college courses is a game of constrained optimization. And I dare someone to tell me that surviving four years of Harvard isn’t a game in and of itself. In the role-playing game of Harvard, finals are the veritable endbosses, your tutors are the non-playable characters, and your textbooks are shields of +3 intelligence. You’re up, it’s your turn to roll for initiative.
—Peter L. Knudson ’13, a Blog Executive, has got his head in the game.

It’s been a tough couple of years for fans of traditional cinema. Good old-fashioned talkies have been steadily losing ground in an industry where 3D blockbusters mean higher ticket prices for the consumer and new mega-yachts for studio executives. 2D denizens like Spielberg and Scorsese have capitulated to depthmongers like Cameron and Bay, and with recent advances in technology we’re just a few steps away from being able to feel the Autobots transform (an option I’m sure is already available in Japan). Respect for the craft be damned, Hollywood’s ruling moguls are coating bad scripts in CGI and pop-up book visuals, then shoving them down our collective throat like mom’s steamed rutabaga.
Television, of course, is following suit, and before we know it the cast of “30 Rock” will be standing in our living rooms, their self-parodying holograms complaining about Liz Lemon this and why-is-Tracy-marrying-a-tiger that. The nightly news will soon feature the day’s international riots in real time and all three angry dimensions, and just watching football will result in a mild concussion. And once game developers catch up to the new wave of 3D TVs, you can expect national productivity to drop even more whenever they release a new “Call of Duty.”
3D has quickly become the new golden standard for visual entertainment, and for those of us overwhelmed by the cars careening out of our screens and into our screaming faces, the immediate future seems like an overstimulating mess. The world’s becoming one big View-Master, only you can’t control what you see simply by turning the paper disc.
But perhaps we can learn from young Justin Bieber—himself the unlikely inspiration for a 3D feature film—in saying “Never Say Never” to the demise of 2D visuals. Indeed, the recording industry seems to precede movies and TV in terms of content shifts, and though Bieber’s omnipotence has marked the transition to digital downloads as music’s supreme vector, it also coincides with the resurgence of vintage platforms. Through a combination of hipster ingenuity and the influence of grammatically-transcendent artists like ?uestlove, more people are rediscovering vinyl for both its retro character and undeniably richer sound quality. Humanity has practically maxed out its options for listening to Lady Gaga on potato-chip-thin Apple products, and now we’re turning to our earlier roots for an altogether more wholesome listening experience.
I might be reaching here, but I think the same principles will eventually apply to the growing visual divide. 3D has the advantage in capturing audiences’ eyes, but no number of loincloths can hide the inherent shallowness behind the Na’vi. Filmmakers have yet to prove they can consistently utilize the medium without compromising plot, dialogue, and actors’ abilities to help define their own characters. Though 3D TVs will soon be within more people’s price range, the extra dimension could simply be too much stimulation for those who watch to relax at the end of a long day. Even 3D’s visual advantage is somewhat tenuous, as producing the effect requires screening at considerably lower light levels. The result—at least with current equipment—is a noticeably blurrier final product, which will be especially problematic once the technology reaches the adult entertainment industry.
In the war between 2D and 3D aficionados, the 2010 Oscars might have been a turning point akin to Gettysburg. That’s when “Avatar”—thus far the Holy Grail of visual “daaaa-amn”—lost the Best Picture category to “The Hurt Locker,” a movie chock full of scenes that were purposefully hard to watch. James Cameron’s 3D masterpiece lost to a film whose depth shone through largely independent of its visuals, with voters picking the beige tableau of an Iraqi desert over the grandeur of a bioluminescent dream called Pandora. 3D might be unparalleled in bringing fantasy to life, but comparing the two works shows 2D is still tops when it comes to giving the viewer a sense of reality.
Entertainment trends are cyclical, and while I can’t imagine 3D will ever fade back to the role of occasional novelty, I doubt it spells the end for 2D films and television. There comes a point when pushing the sensory envelope actually detracts from the viewer’s experience, a fact that will hopefully not be lost on the world’s entertainment visionaries. After all, how many 3D movies can you name that—apart from some admittedly insane visuals—were actually any good?
Well, except for “Up.” I cried during that one, too.

Most lecture classes come with certain assumptions: a sea of students, a sea of laptops, the ability to get behind in the readings without dire consequences. But if only 12 people sign up for the class, these expectations won’t match up to reality.
Natasha N. Dodge ’13 shopped English 141: The 18th Century Novel anticipating a standard lecture class based on its advertisement in the course catalogue.
“When I shopped it there were probably 25 people around the table,” she said. Only eight ended up enrolling in the course—all girls.
The professor of English 141, Melissa Ganz, a department fellow, is new to Harvard this year and wasn’t sure what the dynamic of the class would be. She ultimately shifted to a more seminar-style format by emphasizing discussion.
Despite the greater demands of a seminar, Dodge enjoyed what she said made for a more relaxed atmosphere.
“Sandy” U. Uwimana ’14 also acknowledged the benefits of her small lecture class, Culture and Belief 29: “Strange Mutations.”
“The professor seems much more approachable,” she said. “But initially I thought it was kind of awkward since there was so few people.”
This semester, Associate Professor Adelheid Voskuhl lectures twice a week to 16 students in History of Science 186: Technology in a Social World. Although she has taught the course twice before, the number of students has varied. According to Voskuhl, factors such as whether it is offered in Gen Ed, or whether athletes take the class in clusters, can make a difference in such a small lecture.
While Voskuhl admitted that large lecture classes allow her to get a message across to a broader audience, she affirmed that a smaller size is more effective and engaging.
“There’s a better connection to the students,” she said. “I try to allow more time for questions.”
Intentionally or haphazardly, these classes offer a blend of lecture and seminar formats that combine the best (and worst) of both worlds. A unique intellectual experience, to be sure—although those looking to hide in the back should probably steer clear. Finally, a precocious premed fled the scene after an encounter with a wide-eyed Brown student, but word on the street is more happened behind the scenes.

Some things on campus come in two’s: beds in a Lowell single, spring rolls at the Kong—and sometimes, professors. In team-taught classes, the two teachers form a unit; each provides something the other cannot. Professor A might describe team-teaching as thrilling; Professor B might argue that surely it’s more reflective. One thing is indisputable: at Harvard, students can find both disconcertingly large lectures and frighteningly small tutorials that are team-taught. Lecturer on History and Literature Patrick Pritchett explains that once students have settled into the sophomore tutorial he teaches with lecturer on Hist and Lit George H. Blaustein, the “idea of there being two teachers making it twice as hard just kind of evaporates.”
SHARING THE STAGE
Disagreements between the two professors of team-taught classes are part of the reason for their appeal. According to Andrew J. Berry, co-lecturer of Organic and Evolutionary Biology 53 with Associate Professor Hopi E. Hoekstra, “We know our positions on various things and it becomes a point where we can predict how the other will react. It’s theater almost, adding a level of interaction between the professors which makes it more interesting and engages the students.”
Creative drama also exists in Hist and Lit sophomore tutorials. Two faculty members lead each tutorial: one is a historian and the other is a literary scholar. According to Blaustein, “Because it’s a seminar there is a built-in unpredictability and occasion for improvisation, which in my experience has always been positive. So if you are dealing with material that is traditionally ‘historical,’ it is the literary co-teacher who might offer the surprising perspective, or the provocative perspective. In some ways the collaboration is also a kind of mutual challenge.”
No ‘I’ IN TEAM
Professors vary in their approaches to team-teaching. Berry explains that in OEB 53, he and Hoekstra try to stay away from tag-teaching, where a professor comes to class only on the days he or she is giving the lecture. “That can be a recipe for disaster because people don’t know what the other person has taught and the style of teaching, maybe even the level of teaching is very inconsistent,” says Berry.
Julian Moll-Rocek ’12, who enjoyed the engaging dynamic between the professors of OEB 53, cautions that not all team-taught classes are created equal. “I have taken classes where it’s a different lecturer each time, and that can be a little bit hard to follow.”
Professors acknowledge that effective team-taught classes involve collaborative effort. Berry explains, “The idea is we are both present at every lecture and ideally we participate. Even if I’m not teaching I will definitely want to be there. I’m, if you like, a stooge in the audience. I think that sort of interactivity makes a lecture much more interesting.”
Professors also benefit from this interaction.“It’s mutually stimulating for the teachers. We can play off of each other in unexpected ways. It’s just kind of a win-win scenario,” says Pritchett. Students stand to benefit from learning the material from two experts rather than one. “From a pedagogical point of view I think it’s great that we can play to our strengths,” says Berry.
And yet when a professor opens his or her door to another expert, conflicts in opinion arise, and something has to give. “Whereas my vision of the universe is pretty concordant with Hopi’s, certainly we have disagreements about things, whether it’s just a matter of emphasis or a theoretical issue within the field ... that’s much more interesting and more intellectually honest,” says Berry. “In many ways I would say the major disadvantage of team-teaching is at the same time a major strength.”
ON THE UP SWING
Professors sing the praises of team-teaching, and students seem to agree. The number of students in OEB 53 has tripled since the class was modified to a team-taught class. “When we first started teaching [OEB 53] it was around 30. Since it’s been team-taught it’s grown to 90,” says Hoekstra.
This increase in interest seems to be correlated with the increase in professors. “Different students have different ways of learning and here you sort of get two for one, you get to hear things in two different ways, you get two different styles,” explains Hoekstra.
 
A HARMONIOUS OVERLAP
During a Hist and Lit seminar, students learn to approach a text from both historical and literary standpoints. But ideally, “those kind of distinctions break down and we all become students of the process,” says Pritchett. In the end, the best team-taught classes are not watered-down versions of each expert’s background, but instead provide a strengthened level of discussion and argument. According to Blaustein, “One myth of the interdisciplinary endeavor is that there is a perfect harmonious overlap of disciplines. But in fact, one of the most productive aspects of team-teaching is, paradoxically, that you end up making the boundaries between disciplines clearer, even as you draw on them both.”

"Did I ever mention that her bare arm bore the 8 of vaccination? That I loved her hopelessly? That she was only fourteen? An inquisitive butterfly passed, dipping, between us."
Although they are easy to miss, such fleeting references to butterflies appear throughout Vladimir Nabokov’s novels, gracing his characters’ afternoon walks, lofty observations, and philosophical musings. These butterflies are largely insubstantial instances of passing beauty, often tangential to the actual movement of the story. And yet they appear in nearly in all of Nabokov’s works, a testament to his fascination with the order of arthropods and their delicate wings.
The above quotation is from “Lolita,” the novel that gained Nabokov widespread acclaim. Specimens of each of the butterflies mentioned in “Lolita” are now pinned in a tray in a cabinet in Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), as are all of the butterflies Nabokov ever mentions in his novels.
The cabinet is filled floor to ceiling with trays of hundreds of specimens ranging from sea green Luna moths the size of one’s hand to the petite Polyommatus blues. Each tray is dedicated to one of Nabokov’s works and houses every specimen that the work references. The butterflies flutter through his novels, but now they are inert, the objects of scientific study.
Nabokov, known mostly for his literature, worked for six years as curator of the butterfly—or Lepidoptera—wing of the MCZ. There he developed a theory regarding the migration of the Polyommatus blue butterflies. Although his taxonomic research was largely forgotten in the decades after his departure from Harvard, Naomi E. Pierce, a biology professor in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department, has renewed the attention paid to Nabokov’s work in Lepidoptera, authoring a new much-talked-about study that legitimates the novelist’s scientific pursuits.
Nabokov was both a writer and a scientist, and a look into his time at Harvard reveals the precarious balance he tried to strike between Lepidoptera and literature, as well as the marked tension he had with a university that is now profoundly affected by his work.
A BURGEONING PASSION FOR BUTTERFLIES
As a child, Nabokov loved butterflies. His passion for Lepidoptera lasted his entire lifetime. Each summer, he and his wife Vera travelled to Colo. and Utah to expand his collection. Notably, the first work Nabokov published in English was an article in the scientific journal The Entomologist.
In 1941, while teaching at Wellesley College, the amateur butterfly collector made a visit to Harvard’s MCZ seeking to compare his personal collection to the University’s. He had arrived in the United States one year prior.
He was astonished by how poorly organized Harvard’s Lepidoptera collection was, and before leaving the museum that day he left a note offering to help rearrange it. What started as an unpaid position tidying the University’s Lepidoptera wing turned into a part-time job. Within a short period, Nabokov became the de facto curator of the collection, working in office number 402, on Oxford St.
Nabokov was a taxonomist, meaning his primary task at the MCZ was classification. Working in an era before molecular biology, he studied speciation by examining genitalia. While at the MCZ, Nabokov focused his studies on a group of butterflies known as Polyommatinae. Nicknamed ‘The Blues,’ the Polyommatinae form a subgroup within the family Lycaenidae.
These are not the bright oranges of the Monarch. Some Polyommatus blues’ wings are a dusty cornflower blue, faded around the edges. Others are more copper, still others are white. Often, the wings are ringed with brown.
Nabokov was unique in his efforts to postulate the specific order in which species developed. “He was more evolutionary in his thinking,” and also advanced in purporting numerical taxonomy, Pierce says.
“For a traditional morphologist at the time, he was ahead of his time in trying to be so quantitative,” she continues.
CONTROVERSIAL CANDIDACY
While at Harvard, Nabokov lived in a cul-de-sac off of Concord Avenue, a two minute walk from the Quad, in a four-story red brick building. It was here, at 8 Craigie Circle, in apartment number 35, that Nabokov penned his first American novel.
In the introduction to “Bend Sinister,” Nabokov describes his time there, saying, “I slept at least four or five hours, the rest of the night walking pencil in hand about the dingy little flat.”
“He wrote his first really great English language novel while living there and looking outside,” says James R. Russell, professor of Armenian Studies, who taught a Mather House seminar on Nabokov for many years. “It begins with the view from that window.”
Nabokov’s tenure at the MCZ lasted only until 1948, when he left Cambridge for a position as a professor of Russian literature at Cornell. Though he was part of the staff at the MCZ, Nabokov was never officially affiliated with the Harvard Faculty.
At Cornell, Nabokov published “Lolita,” for which he quickly gained widespread literary acclaim.
With his newfound fame as an author, Nabokov found it difficult to maintain his commitment to both literature and Lepidoptera. “I found it no longer physically possible to combine scientific research with lectures, belles-lettres, and ‘Lolita,’” Nabokov remarked.
In 1951, Nabokov’s son Dmitri entered the College. While his son was a student here, Nabokov returned as a visiting professor and lectured on “Don Quixote,” arguing that the novel should be removed from the canon.
After his son graduated, Nabokov applied for a professorship at Harvard, whose Slavic Department outshone that of Cornell. However, Roman Jakobson, the famed philologist and linguist who was then a professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, staunchly opposed Nabokov’s candidacy.
“In an ideal world, he and Nabokov would have been good friends,” Russell says, “But the world being what it is, they had a falling out.”
The two disagreed on whether it was permissible to maintain ties with the Soviet academic establishment: Jakobson kept in close contact with the academics in the USSR during the time of Stalin, which Nabokov denounced as morally impermissible. Nabokov’s family had fled Russia in 1919 as political exiles.
Jakobson also believed that Nabokov lacked the scholarly experience required for professorship. In defending his decision to oppose Nabokov’s appointment, Jakobson famously said, “even if one allows that he is an important writer, are we next to invite an elephant to be Professor of Zoology?”
So, Nabokov spent the rest of his academic career in Ithaca, before moving to Montreux to pursue writing full time.
“NABOKOV'S BLUES"
Prior to his application for professorship, however, Nabokov described his lab at the MCZ in a letter to his sister.
“My laboratory occupies half of the fourth floor,” Nabokov wrote in 1945. “Most of it is taken up by rows of cabinets, containing sliding cases of butterflies ... We have butterflies from all over the world ... Along the windows extend tables holding my microscopes, test tubes, acids, papers, pins, etc.”
Over half a century later, the MCZ looks nearly the same as it did in the 1940s. The Lepidoptera wing is packed with dingy gray file cabinets that span the room from wall to wall, floor to ceiling. Nabokov’s penchant for organization seems to have stuck: each specimen has been meticulously classified and labeled. The smell of napthalene—mothballs—is overwhelming. Brightly colored butterflies, some possessing a metallic sheen, pop against the otherwise musty interior. The hallway floor, which has not been replaced in the intermittent decades, features rippled cement. Nabokov used to say that it resembled the skin of an elephant, Pierce says.
Today, Pierce curates the Lepidoptera wing of the MCZ that Nabokov once presided over. Pierce first came to Harvard in 1977 as a graduate student. She was assigned to an office in the dark and gloomy basement of the biology labs. While exploring the room, she sat down at the desk that had been left there. “It was one of those old metal desks with the laminated top and metal drawers,” Pierce describes. “I opened up one of the drawers and there were all these labels—they all said V. Nabokov.”
It was not until two decades after she first sat down at Nabokov’s old desk, however, that Pierce became interested in exploring Nabokov’s work. Over the years, Nabokov’s research in Lepidoptera was acknowledged, but the scientific community had not given his theories much credence. Nabokov’s lack of formal training undermined his scientific work. Additionally, molecular biology had begun to overshadow the field of taxonomy. But a few individuals, namely entomologist Kurt Johnson and Steven L. Coates, had begun re-examining Nabokov’s theories on the Polyommatus blues.
In the late 1990s, Pierce read Johnson and Coates’ book, “Nabokov’s Blues.” The book highlighted Nabokov’s 1945 paper, “Notes on Neotropical Plebijinae,” where Nabokov classified a vast array of South American blue butterflies. But more significant than his system of classification is the fact that Nabokov attempted to construct an evolutionary timeline for these butterflies, an endeavor that few taxonomists undertook.
The South American blues, Nabokov speculated, had migrated from Asia to the New World by crossing the Bering Strait, before crossing the isthmus of Panama and settling on the tops of the Andes. This migration was followed by four more waves of blue butterflies, each also crossing the Bering Strait.
The paper was unique in language, as well as in its hypothesis. “He talks about receiving an ‘invasion from Asia,’” Pierce says, “This is 1945, so of course he’s laughing as he’s writing that.”
Pierce was inspired to further explore Nabokov’s hypotheses using DNA gene sequencing techniques, which would allow her to create a phylogeny, or study of evolutionary relatedness, of the Polyommatus blues. The project was the result of “collaborative effort[s] of scientists around the world,” says Pierce, who lists Roger U. Vila—a scientist and mountaineer—as well as Johnson, Zsolt Balint, and Dubi Benyamini as co-writers. She and her team traveled to South America, to climates as inhospitable as the Andes, to collect specimens. Finding—and catching—a butterfly atop a precarious peak in South America requires patience and determination.
Pierce remembers that it was not until the last day of an expedition that they finally caught the desired specimen of Eldoradina, a type of butterfly, which was integral to completing their study.
In a paper published on Jan. 26 of this year, Pierce and her co-writers confirmed Nabokov’s hypotheses on the blues. Not only did Nabokov get the genera’s migratory patterns correct, he also correctly identified the precise order of its movement to the New World.
“It was when we went through and we realized that even the timing of it was the same—that’s when we thought, ‘Wow this really was pretty amazing,’” Pierce says of Nabokov’s theories, which had  proven true.
Carl Zimmer wrote a New York Times article covering Pierce’s paper on Jan. 25. It was the most e-mailed story of the week.
FROM SCIENCE TO LITERATURE
Although interest in Nabokov’s lepidopteral work within the scientific community had been limited before Pierce’s paper, general fascination with Nabokov’s butterflies has been fairly consistent. Over the years, so many individuals have asked to see the specimens that Nabokov curated that the butterflies he classified are now being removed from the MCZ’s larger collection so as to be more readily accessible for public viewing.
In the corner of this lab is the filing cabinet holding the shelves of Nabokov’s literary butterflies. Then-curator of Lepidoptera Deane Bowers put together this collection in 1988 for an exhibit on the intersection of Nabokov’s Lepidoptera and writing. Even though Nabokov called his interest in butterflies “exclusively scientific,” he mentions butterflies a multitude of times in his novels.
Although Nabokov did not consider his science and his literature to be particularly related, he did see the connections between science and art in a more abstract sense. “There is no science without fancy and no art without fact,” Nabokov is famous for saying.
“He was a taxonomist, concerned with making sure that every butterfly was in its appropriate category and that he knew its name, and he brings a sense of that into his stylistics as well,” says Jacob M. Emery, a tutor in the Department of Comparative Literature. “When you read his works, you know the exact species of every tree that a character passes.”
In his literary stardom, Nabokov became known for syntactically complex sentences and strikingly specific language. His memoir, “Speak, Memory,” is laced with this specificity of observation: “On the white window ledges, on the long window seats covered with faded calico, the sun breaks into geometrical gems after passing through rhomboids and squares of stained glass,” Nabokov writes.
Nabokov’s trilingualism—he grew up speaking Russian, English, and French—contributed to his unique writing style. “His English has a trace of foreignness, a foreign syntax, that makes it very interesting,” says Svetlana Boym, professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures and professor of Comparative Literature. “This, perhaps, is what made his writing so remarkably captivating.”
Leland de la Durantaye, an associate professor of English, specializes in Nabokov’s literature. Durantaye imagines Nabokov’s worldview to be that there are “ever so many wonders around one every moment of every day and it sufficed to look, to look carefully, vigilantly, to see them,” Durantaye writes in an e-mail.
Charlotte Austin ’11, who took the Mather House seminar on Nabokov with Russell last Spring, describes Nabokov’s prose as constructed like a puzzle. “It demands you to really look into things and not take anything for granted and not believe that anything is a coincidence,” she says.
This decoding is an experience Nabokov wanted for his readers.
“He wanted a reader who doesn’t try to impose symbols and ideological interpretations, but who reads through details,” Boym says.
DEFYING CATEGORIZATION
For someone who spent years classifying hundreds of specimens, Nabokov himself seems to defy categorization. According to Boym, “Nabokov was not a writer to whom a single label applied.”
Nabokov, who was born in Russia, established himself early on as a Russian lyric poet. However, his Russian contemporaries did not consider his poetry to be first-rate. It was only after Nabokov came to the United States and left poetry for novel writing that his work began to be recognized on the international stage. “He retrospectively considered himself a very bad poet and believed he sort of killed this lyrical poet to become a great novelist,” Boym explains.
While nearly all of Nabokov’s work was published in both English and Russian, the English and Russian versions of his novels, short stories, and poems were rarely exact translations of one another. Nabokov translated his own writing, or at least closely supervised the translation process, and in doing so frequently made significant changes to his own work. He altered dates, replaced references, omitted pages at a time, and even changed the ending of his novel “Despair” in the English version, providing much fodder for literary analysis.
Over the decades, Nabokovians have struggled with whether to consider Nabokov a Russian or an American writer—he left Russia for Western Europe, and later America, at a young age, but remained strongly connected to Russian culture throughout his lifetime. Some point to the fact that he wrote his memoir in English as evidence for his ultimate identification with America. However, Nabokov continued writing in Russian even while he was living in the United States and frequently wrote of a homecoming to the USSR, especially in his poetry, which he continued to write without it being his primary pursuit.
“One must note that he consciously placed himself in both the Russian and Anglo-American literary traditions,” Jasper N. Henderson ’12, who studies Nabokov, writes in an e-mail.
Nabokov himself never quite took the question seriously. “He made a very funny joke that he used to be a Russian writer, and then he came to America, gained a lot of weight and stopped smoking,” Boym remarks. “‘Now two-thirds of him is American’ he used to say.”
NABOKOV’S AURA
Asked if she had previously read Nabokov’s novels, Pierce replies, “Yes, who hasn’t?”
Nabokov’s larger-than-life legacy has a distinct mysticism about it. Readers have long been captivated by his heart-rending storytelling and linguistic genius. “I always return to Nabokov if I’m standing by my bookshelf and feel like taking a book out and reading a couple of paragraphs of extravagantly good prose,” Emery says.
Harvard University, an institution where Nabokov was never fully accepted, now offers a multitude of classes, both scientific and literary, that focus on Nabokov’s work. His thoughts and stories crop up in the lives of professors and students alike, in areas both personal and professional.
Boym jokes that she now holds the position Nabokov never achieved—she admits, “I think he deserved it more.” Boym stresses that Nabokov has influenced her as an academic. “I think everything I’ve written about is to some extent connected to Nabokov,” she says, failing to conceal a smile of admiration.
Russell, meanwhile, remembers reading Nabokov’s “Pnin” at 15 on his way to school on New York City’s D train. At the time, he was fascinated with Nabokov’s portrait of Timofey Pavlovich Pnin, a Russian emigre professor escaping the “Hitler war.” Two weeks ago, Russell, now a professor, sat in Starbucks at the Harvard Coop, wearing an olive green Israeli Defense Forces sweatshirt and drawing pages for illuminated Hebrew manuscripts.
Russell still finds himself returning to Nabokov for inspiration.
He says, “I do very often walk at night to Craigie Circle where he lived and just say a prayer for him, or look around. It’s one of my holy places.”
“Some of my students once actually rented an apartment in that building so they could be close to where Nabokov had lived,” Russell adds. “On the night of their graduation I remember we all went outside holding lit candles and read from our favorite bits.”
In “Speak, Memory,” Nabokov paints himself as the romanticized figure that Russell and his students imagine him to be. “I have hunted butterflies in various climes and disguises,” Nabokov writes. “As a pretty boy in knickerbockers and sailor cap; as a lanky cosmopolitan expatriate in flannel bags and beret; as a fat, hatless old man in shorts.”
In the same text, Nabokov comments on his time in Cambridge: “Incredibly happy memories, quite comparable, in fact, to those of my Russian boyhood, are associated with my research work at the MCZ, Cambridge, Mass (1941-1948).”

I feel like I should remember the first time I came close to committing suicide, as if it’s something along the lines of a first kiss. I guess it should be one of those things that produces a rush of sensory imagery with the slightest trigger. You’re meant to remember some soft noise humming in your ear, a faint trembling of the body, a detailed image of what was around you—even though your eyes were closed. It should be one of those moments, the kind that remains vivid even as the rest of your past blurs and fades away; it’s the kind that you’re supposed to remember, right? I don’t.
I can only talk in generalities, what it was like every time I felt like this. There were always tears—lots of them—my shirt wet as they seeped down my cheeks, paused at my chin, dropped to my chest. I would be sitting on my bed, fixated on a single point in the room, my eyesight transitioning in and out of focus. At times I saw everything—my face smiling back at me from glossy pictures on the walls, the days on my hanging calendar, days I never wanted to face—at others, only my thoughts. There was always some reason to feel meaningless. Most importantly, it was always night.
I played out scenarios in my head. My knife was on the top shelf of my bookcase, my fourth-floor window could be easily opened, my roommate wouldn’t be back for another hour or so.
Eventually, I would begin to turn the knife over in my hand. It provided no guarantee. What if I didn’t do it properly? I wasn’t looking for a cry for help, I was looking for a way out. I would open my window, delicately balancing so that my torso leaned precariously near the tipping point. Then came the painful deliberation.
“All I would have to do is tilt a little farther forward.”
“The fall would feel nice.”
“But it’s only the fourth floor, what if it doesn’t work?”
“Am I really that worried about the pain?”
“What if I regret my decision just before it ends?”
It was this last question that saved me. Somehow, my lack of confidence in the future both made me desire to end my life and prevented me from doing so. Feeling all the more inadequate, I would turn on the shower, remove my damp clothes, and sit on the cold tiled floor. A thousand more water droplets washed away my own.
There were many nights like this. No matter how many times I reasoned my way out of it, the darkness always washed over me once more. I could not prevent night from falling. Tears, glossy pictures, misery—these are the things that consumed me. Without any faith in life beyond death, I saw no point in prolonging the inevitable. Why continue to exist?
For a number of reasons, returning to campus at the beginning of this year was very difficult for me. The end of freshman year had left me feeling abandoned by those I had considered to be my closest friends. I filled my schedule with clubs, activities, and classes to avoid the isolation I felt when I was idle. When you’re running from one meeting to the next, it becomes easy to forget how alone you really are.
But while I could fill my days with meetings and work, I had little control over my nights. It’s hard to escape the truth when you are left alone with it. It was a reality I continued to run from.
Terrified of being by myself, I spent all my time with my boyfriend. We ate meals together, took classes together, did the same activities. He was there for me every single night as I cried for no reason other than sadness. He gave things up, knowing that I would break down at the mere mention of most social events. He took the knife out of my hand. He picked me up off the shower floor. He was the one constant in my life.
I can only describe the feeling as physical, all-consuming. Any moment my mind began to idle, thoughts of suicide would consume me. Looking out of a window, I tried to feel the fall. Swimming laps, I would imagine fluid filling my lungs.
The worst part? I felt guilty.
You’re not supposed to attend Harvard and get depressed. You’re supposed to attend Harvard and take advantage of opportunities. Opportunities. “Isn’t is amazing being there? There are so many things you can do!” “You go to Harvard? That’s so wonderful, you must have so many options.” “There are just so many things to take advantage of there.” You’re not supposed to complain about the fact that you go to Harvard. It’s the dream. You are supposed to go to Harvard and do things, make the most of it.
“Yeah, it’s a great place. There are so many possibilities,” I would usually say.
But it wasn’t just the outsiders who made me feel ashamed. Even at school I was surrounded by thousands of other students—all of them able to manage the same difficulties that had rendered me hopeless. They wrote papers, chaired activities, networked, partied, all with an air of ease.
“Hey, how’s it going?” “OhmygodIamsoooobusyIhavethreepsetsandtwopaperstowritetonightbutitistotallyfine.”
Effortless perfection. I was the exception. I was the one who was incapable of handling all the wonderful opportunities that Harvard presented me with.
At least that’s what I thought.
One day, I decided to talk to someone. Not as in talking to a professional, I had tried that already. I mean, I had an actual conversation with another student at work. Instead of joking about lack of sleep and 20-page papers, I opened up. For the first time, I discussed what was really going wrong in my life. I told her about what had happened, the constant physical pressure that I felt on every inch of my body, the apathy with which I now looked at every aspect of my life. I told her I wanted to die.
In turn, she opened up to me.
Here was someone with whom I sat in an office every single week yet knew very little about. Who else might be feeling what I was feeling? Who else might feel like they are the only one? I started talking to more people.  I started to ask questions and I stopped accepting “psetclubactivitypaperNOSLEEP” as a response. The things I learned both allowed me to share what I was going through and helped me to realize that what I was experiencing did not warrant feelings of shame. By the time finals period came, my nights didn’t seem so daunting.
J-Term provided me with the time necessary to complete the process; leaving Harvard allowed me to reevaluate what I wanted out of my four years here. I strengthened ties with friends who were positive influences on my life and cut ties with those who weren’t. I built the support system I needed to face the veneer of effortless perfection once more. The pressure was finally starting to fade.
But returning to campus wasn’t easy. There are still days when I feel trapped by emotion. There are still days when I’m not sure if I can face other people. But there aren’t still days when I pick up the knife.
Harvard isn’t always the glossy ivy-covered utopia that many conceive it to be. There are moments of that place, yes. Walking past Memorial Church in the fall with reds and oranges on the ground around you, the first warm day in the spring when students on blankets adorn the Yard. Brochure Harvard does exist. The reality of the situation, however, is that this is not the Harvard that many students must wake up to and battle every single day. It is not always a place where conversations about mental health are necessarily encouraged. On a campus where the need for assistance is too often perceived as a flaw, the student body has a tendency to rely on variations of “I’m fine.” And, at a college where so many students already have far too much on their plate, it’s understandable that most don’t press the question further.
I’ve learned the importance of doing just that. I have also learned to cut back—on friendships, on extracurriculars, on classes. By concentrating my energy on the people and activities that I care most about, I have gradually begun to get past all Harvard has taken and realized just how much it can give. The most important opportunity I’ve found here is the opportunity for happiness, though the place that lies between night and Brochure Harvard holds a happiness that can be hard to find.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The working group examining issues facing bisexual, gay, lesbian, and transgender students is on track to report its recommendations to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds this spring, according to members of the committee.
When Hammonds commissioned the working group—which includes faculty members, administrators, a representative from the Harvard University Police Department, and three students—in October, she announced that the group would make its recommendations confidentially to her in March. Members of the committee said that they anticipate meeting this goal.
Susan B. Marine, an assistant dean for student life who co-chairs the committee, said that the committee has gathered information through surveys sent to undergraduates, public meetings convened in the Houses, and conversations with faculty, staff, and students.
While the members of the group said they have agreed not to discuss specific details of their proceedings with the press, Marine indicated that their suggestions, which will be based on their fact-finding, will be “probably pretty concrete things.”
In particular, Marine said that the working group has talked extensively about students’ desire for an expanded space for the Queer Resource Center. In November, students held a protest, arguing that the underground room in Thayer basement deserved a more prominent location and a professional staffer.
Miguel Garcia ’12, a member of the committee, said that, among students whom the working group has consulted, “there is a consensus for a centralized LGBT resource center.”
“It’s certainly something we’ve been talking about,” Marine said. “Space is a very difficult thing to find in Harvard Yard or anywhere else.”
Though Garcia said that the exact proposals that the group will make have not yet been determined, he added that the committee would make “concrete, tangible recommendations” in its report to Hammonds.
“It’s not going to be only idealistic in terms of thoughts and ideas,” Garcia said. “It’s going to be with words that indicate allocations and a new plan for LGBT resources on campus.”

Eight local non-profit organizations received a total of $100,000 in grants to help foster economic development in the Allston and Brighton neighborhoods last week from a fund endowed by Harvard University.
This is the third year that the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund—which was created with a $500,000 endowment from the University in 2009—has allocated $100,000 in grants.
The non-profits provide a number of services to the community, including offering health care for the uninsured and creating opportunities for local youth to attend summer camps for free.
The fund is part of the University’s $25 million investment aimed at addressing local needs and improving the quality of life in the neighborhood.
“I’m really thrilled that Harvard is recognizing community based organizations, working here in the community,” said Sister Pat Andrews of the Sisters of St. Joseph’s Academy. Andrews is the director of the Literacy Connection, which offers English language and citizenship courses to Allston-Brighton adults.
“We can use this money to strengthen our curriculum and materials we solicit,” Andrews said.
The grant awards were selected by a committee of Allston residents and representatives of the Boston Mayor’s office and the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino stressed that these awards will help organizations sustain their services despite the poor economy.
“Harvard Allston Partnership Fund grants bring opportunity, education, and vital services to North Allston’s residents,” Menino said in a press release.
Cathi Campbell, a board director for the Vocational Advancement Center (VAC)—a non-profit organization that provides job placement and training for special needs adults—said that budget cuts due to the economic crisis forced the VAC to let go of three staff members recently. Campbell added that the HAPF grant would allow the VAC to hire a part-time employee.
“He or she is going to make an incredible impact on these individuals that wouldn’t have been able to receive services otherwise,” said Campbell.
The Fishing Academy, the Allston-Brighton Baby Diaper Pantry, Earthwatch Institute, Gardner Pilot Academy, and West End House Girls Camp also received grants this year, which ranged from $4,800 to $25,000.
A total of 17 local non-profits have received grants from the fund.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cities foster the communication of complex ideas, making them key to the future of America and the world, Economics Professor Edward L. Glaeser said yesterday in a talk at the Harvard Book Store.
Glaeser’s new book, “Triumph of a City,” explores the cultural and economic spheres of major cities today. His presentation yesterday focused on the ability of cities to enable people to communicate and share ideas in more valuable ways than telecommunication.
“It is remarkable that despite the radical decline in transportation and communication costs that cities remain so vital, important, and successful,” Glaeser said. “This is true in the United States, where cities have come roaring back from the troubled period of the 1970s, and it’s even more true in the developing world where cities are providing a path from poverty to prosperity,”
Glaeser also commented on the current state of the U.S. economy, particularly with regards to the recent mortgage crisis and persistent sprawl into the suburbs.
“As America looks forward to economic renewal it is not going to come from hiring lots of guys to put up infrastructure in low-density America, it’s going to come from being smarter. It’s going to come from outthinking other countries on the planet,” Glaeser said.
Glaeser, who teaches the course Economics 1011a: “Microeconomic Theory,” explained to the audience that cities serve the special purpose of providing  people with the face-to-face contact that allows for human capital and productivity to increase. As human beings we are naturally a social species that has the innate ability to “sop up” information from those around them, and cities, he said, appeal to this very instinct.
Glaeser said that as much as teachers and professors would like to think that they are the most important source of imparting ideas, cities truly fulfill this function better than any teacher ever could.
Still, Glaeser added that schools provide one the vital centers of communication and that their improvement is essential for keeping urban populations high.
“There is no reason why cities can’t have uniformly good schools. The same powers of competition and innovation that work in the private sector can work for schools as well,” he said.
After appearing in multiple media outlets, Glaeser just returned to Cambridge after speaking on the Daily Show with John Stewart Monday night.
“I haven’t been that scared in 30 years. You’re in a position where it’s enormously easy to make both yourself and indeed Harvard look very foolish. I did my best to try and avoid that,” Glaeser said.
But in the end Glaeser said it was a good experience
“Stewart himself was enormously kind and a pleasure to work with—and he gave me a Daily Show t-shirt.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most seniors began their job search this past fall at countless Office of Career Services info sessions and recruitment events—with many continuing the process into the spring—several students have started and ended their job search just a block away at the Institute of Politics.
The IOP-sponsored Director’s Internships provide Harvard students with a chance to engage in the world of politics and public service for a summer. But for some students, this experience can lead to a full-time post-graduate position.
For Eric N. Hysen ’11 and Abby D. Phillip ’10,  the Director’s Internships provided much more than an educational opportunity—each of them say they came away from their summer with a positive, professional experience that ultimately led them to accept full-time jobs with their internship employers after graduation.
Hysen, who will take a job at Google after working there the past two summers, found that his experiences during the Director’s Internship changed his long-term career goals.
“I really didn’t think that I would be working at a big company,” Hysen said.
“But I was able to find this group of people doing exactly what I’m interested in doing. There’s no way that would have happened without the Director’s Internship,” he added.
Many students say they were given responsibilities far greater than those of typical interns, resulting in a substantive experience.
Phillip, a former Crimson news executive who interned at the political news outlet Politico in 2009, said her substantial responsibilities during her internship gave her a sense of the life of a professional reporter at the publication.
“Day to day, I was more or less like a full-time employee—coming in in the morning, making phone calls, reporting on stories, and writing on deadline,” Phillip said.
“It wasn’t really a training program—it was a job, and you had to just jump in whether you were ready or not,” he added.
According to Amy A. Howell, director of the IOP’s internship programs,  a 2008 survey conducted by the IOP found that 20% of former interns  said that their experience either led or connected them directly to paid employment.
Each of the three students said that they stayed in contact with their office after completing the summer program —communication that proved critical when they began searching for jobs for after graduation.
Phillips said that prior experience at a company allows recent college graduates to be more competitive in the job market.
“[A Director’s Internship] lets employees try out candidates before they hire them to see if they’re a good fit,” Phillip said. “It allows undergrads with just a bachelor’s degree to get their foot in the door.”
The Director’s Internship program started in 1995 with 10 internships intended to encourage students to spend their summers engaged in politics.
Since then, the program has expanded to include 60 internships encompassing a wide variety of fields.
This year’s offerings include internships in the offices of elected officials—both Republicans and Democrats—as well at as think tanks, media organizations, and non-profits.
“The purpose of the Director’s Internships is completely in line with the mission of the Institute of Politics, and that is to encourage students to consider careers in public service and then to give them the opportunity to work directly in politics and public service over the summer months,” said Howell.
Each internship lasts for eight to ten weeks and includes a $4,000 dollar stipend to cover living expenses for the duration of the program.

David E. Sanger ’82, Chief Washington Correspondent for the New York Times and adjunct lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and Micah L. Sifry, co-founder and editor of the Personal Democracy Forum discussed the role of the Egyptian people and social media in the country’s recent revolution last night.
The new generation of wired and networked youth behaves differently from the generation that did not have access to these tools, which changes the dynamic of modern politics, Sifry said during the event at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics.
“If I had to pinpoint a factor, I would call this either a blogger revolution or a network revolution,” Sifry said, attributing the significant role of youth in the recent events to the phenomenon of social media. “They tweet and respond back and forth in this hyper-transparent way.”
Sanger added that he feels it is unlikely the revolution would have happened in 18 days without social media as a tool.
Sifry noted that while previous public opinion had been that youth are apathetic, observers now see something new developing among politically active young people.
“Right now hopes have been ignited,” he said.
But both Sifry and Sanger said that they could not make predictions about the future in Egypt or in other countries in the area.
“No one knows what the trigger mechanism is,” Sanger said.
As for the role of Facebook in the formation of revolutions in the future, Sifry was cautionary.
“I think it’s a double-edged sword for Facebook, If I’m Facebook, I don’t really want to be seen as something that disruptive,” he said.
Sifry, who is currently working on a book entitled, “WikiLeaks and the Age of Transparency,” runs the Personal Democracy Forum, an website that acts as a hub for the conversation between political practitioners, technologists, and others interested in the burgeoning movement to engage citizens online.
Alexandra M. Harsacky ’13 said she chose to attend the event because a history course had given her an interest in the topic of Egyptian politics.
“Knowing what was going on in Egypt’s past, I wanted to hear more about what’s to come,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many other Harvard seniors, Canadian student Sisi Pan ’11 plans to enter the U.S. workforce after graduation this spring.
After considering going back to her home country, Pan says she has ultimately decided to stay in the U.S. because of the better job opportunities in the States.
“Obviously, the Boston, New York, Philadelphia area is just rife with biotech start-up and pharmaceutical companies, and therefore rife with healthcare consulting companies,” says Pan, who will be working for Massachusetts-based healthcare consulting firm Putnam Associates. “That’s not really an opportunity I found too readily available in Canada.”
Yet a larger job pool does not necessarily translate into an easier job search. As an international student, Pan needed to find a company that not only appreciated her talent, but also was willing to sponsor H-1B visas, a temporary work permit for those with non-immigrant status.
“There were definitely a few firms that I was planning to pursue, but they specifically said they don’t sponsor visas,” Pan says.
In fact, one “big firm” Pan applied to, the name of which she prefers not to reveal, first accepted her application, but then declined it after they found out that she needed a H-1B visa.
According to the Harvard International Office, international students can be at a disadvantage during the job search process because many employers are reluctant to sponsor visas for international students—a hurdle which many of the 695 international students at Harvard may have to face if they choose to pursue employment in the U.S.
THE COST OF H-1B
A. Cansu Aydede ’11 is lucky to be among those international students who have secured H-1B visa sponsorship. She will be working next year at Bridgewater Associates, a large investment firm which manages a $75 billion global investment fund. But Aydede acknowledges that visa sponsorship is frequently a headache for international students.
Students on F-1 student visas can remain in the U.S. for a 12-month period—known as Optional Practical Training—without acquiring a work visa.
Yet the Optional Practical Training period does not curb the difficulty of obtaining H-1B visas, according to Aydede. Only the large and resourceful firms can afford to sponsor H-1B, as the process is both time consuming and costly.
“Nobody hires you for [just 12] months, unless [the companies] are big enough, [or] they know that you are staying with them and are worth all the trouble of them going through the process [of getting the visa],” Aydede says.
According to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service website, companies petitioning for H-1B must file a series of documents and pay a fee ranging from $825 to nearly $4,000.
In addition, the U.S. government currently caps the number of H-1B petitions at 65,000 per fiscal year. As of Jan. 26, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it has already received the maximum number of petitions and will no longer accept H-1B applications until next year.
“Not all firms that are willing to take on American students are willing to sponsor the H-1B, because they don’t have the resources,” says Anusha Tomar ’11, who will be working with McKinsey & Company. Although Tomar is sponsored by McKinsey, she says some of her international friends have encountered problems obtaining H-1B visa sponsorship.
When it comes to fields other than finance and consulting, the issue of H-1B sponsorship becomes even more salient. Students say that companies in the public sector and non-governmental organizations generally tend to be even less willing to invest money in sponsoring H-1B visa.
According to Aydede, many students with interests other than finance or consulting “don’t even apply” to jobs in the U.S. in their fields of interest.
“My impression is, if you are international, and you don’t want to go into finance or consulting, you are in trouble,” Aydede says.
BRIDGING THE GAP
L. Daphne Durham, a Harvard International Office advisor, suggests that students take advantage of Optional Practical Training when searching for post-graduation employment and H-1B sponsorship. Durham points out that students do not need to have a job offer in order to apply for the OPT, which can help them transition into the workforce after graduation.
“[OPT] gives students the chance to try out careers, and also companies the time to apply for H-1B,” Durham says. “It will help you feel more confident about yourself, because you can sell [OPT] to the company.”
Yet the Harvard International Office can only provide limited support when it comes to company sponsorship of the H-1B visa itself.
“We do sponsor outside attorneys who can provide information and give presentation on H-1B and green cards,” says Sharon Ladd, director of HIO, “But there’s not too much we can do because H-1B and green cards are all employer based.”
Students have to take a lot of initiative when it comes to securing a visa, says Robin Mount, director of the Office of Career Services.
“It is important to educate yourself about what options there are, to do research about the companies, to talk to them, and to know in what countries they have offices,” Mount says. “These things are difficult ... this is a tough economic time. Not every opportunity is open to everyone.”
EDUCATING STUDENTS
Some international students say it would be helpful if the College provided more information about the difficulties of securing visa sponsorship.
“The HIO tries as much as possible to provide as much information for international students, but they don’t have enough talks,” Rumbidzai C. Mushavi ’12 says.
“They need to start talking about the issues that international students might run into a lot earlier than they choose to do right now,” she says. “You need to know what options are available to you.”
Mushavi suggests January term as a good time to host visa or OPT workshops, as a number of international students stay on campus during winter break.
Pan adds that it would be beneficial to hear more fellow international students’ experiences.
“OCS has so many info sessions, but from what I know, never ones with international students talking about their experience in finance or consulting. It would be helpful to have someone who has gone through the difficulties and struggles, and gotten their visa,” Pan says. “That would quell the fears of some people.”
In addition to peer information sharing, international students say they wish firms could make their policies on international recruitment more transparent.
“[The On-Campus Interview Program] is actually a good screening mechanism for companies who are willing to sponsor international students,” Aydede says. “If they are big enough to sponsor H-1B, they are big enough to go through the ‘trouble’ of OCI.”
Yet complete transparency may prove to be difficult, as companies looking for particular skill sets may make decisions about H-1B visa sponsorship on a case-by-case basis.
“Even as a Canadian, [where] culturally there isn’t a huge difference ... the visa is definitely an issue,” Pan says. “In fact, if you were from further away, it would almost seem more worth it. We are so close, but we still need to spend so much on sponsorship.”

Expect more meatless options, ethnic cuisines, and homestyle favorites on your plate this semester.
Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services announced Monday on its blog the debut of a number of new food items on the winter menu—including a pepper steak made from a meat substitute and Ethiopian veggie stew—in an effort to provide culinary variety for students.
“We want to bring in new varieties and flavor and keep you from being bored,” said HUHDS spokesperson Crista Martin.
The change was partially motivated by the Residential Dining satisfaction survey, which was sent to students in early November.
This year, residential dining received an overall satisfaction score of 3.76 out of 5—a rating similar to that of last year.
The breakdown of student dietary preferences also remained “almost identical,” with 8 percent of students self-identifying as vegetarians,  less than 1 percent vegan, and another 72 percent indicating they have no personally defined restrictions.
The new recipes for the winter also include new meatless options, such as seitan, a meat substitute made from wheat gluten, and tempeh, a soy product.
Other new entrees include pulled pork tacos, vegan chicken pitas, salmon burgers with green goddess sauce, and buttermilk raisin scones.
The seasonal menus tailor not only to the availability of produce, but also to the students’ changing tastes through the season, Martin said.
For example, students prefer heartier and warmer food in the winter, whereas preferences shift to lighter entrees with fresh spring ingredients, as the weather gradually warms up, she said.
The “exceedingly popular Korean BBQ” will continue to appear every Tuesday, made-to-order omelets on every other Sunday, and topping stations for hot dogs, burritos, tacos, and nachos will be available periodically throughout the semester.
Jennifer L. Martin ’13 said she is a fan of the new baked potato bar, which is featured every Monday with toppings such as vegetarian and meat chili, crumbled bacon, scallions, and sour cream.
Antone Martinho ’13 said he liked the idea of make-your-own stations. “With these make-your-own bars, you can take a dish that might have 16 ingredients and customize it to fit your taste,” he said.
According to the HUHDS blog, over 3,300 students took the satisfaction survey this year.
HUHDS has conducted the survey every fall and spring for more than a decade.

The change from brown to crimson might be an insignificant one on the color spectrum, but the transition from the Brown tennis team to the Harvard tennis team was anything but easy for junior Jonathan Pearlman.
Tennis was not always Pearlman’s passion. Growing up, Pearlman was involved in many different sports, but did not focus specifically on tennis until the age of 12. After deciding to concentrate most of his athletic energy, the New York native began to play in USTA tournaments around the country and achieved a career-high ranking of No. 51 in the junior national rankings.
At the age of 17, Pearlman moved to Spain for a year to train with a club in Barcelona featuring many high-level European players under an experienced coach. During this time, he traveled around Europe playing in International Tennis Federation tournaments.
Pearlman notes key differences between the coaching style in Europe and in the United States.
“There’s a high priority on education in the US,” Pearlman says. “Not that there isn’t in Europe, but athletes are encouraged to really focus on their sport [as a potential career]. … It fosters a very competitive and serious environment where players are able to progress because of the high level of competition.”
With this training under his belt, Pearlman set his sights on playing tennis in college. Although he had many options, Brown seemed to be the perfect choice for Pearlman because the Bears had won two consecutive Ivy League titles and, according to Pearlman, were the strongest Ivy League program at the time.
During his two-year career at Brown, Pearlman dominated on the courts. As a freshman, he led the Bears in winning percentage and, as a sophomore, reached the quarterfinals of the ITA Regional Championships. From the outside looking in, it seemed to be a perfect fit.
Yet the experience was not quite what Pearlman had envisioned. According to Pearlman, the level of the program declined significantly during his time in Providence. In the spring of 2009, Pearlman decided that he was not satisfied with the tennis program at Brown and left.
“It turned out to be a very negative experience athletically,” Pearlman says. “I needed to be in a stronger program with a more experienced coach, like Coach [Dave] Fish, and Harvard was the place for me to come.”
By the time he decided to leave Brown, Pearlman had already missed the deadline to transfer to other colleges. Instead of wasting the year, he used the extra time to improve his game. Pearlman started playing in higher level tournaments, learning to become more aggressive and to develop new strokes.
When it came time to reapply to colleges, Pearlman knew where he wanted to apply. He sent in applications to Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Virginia, as well as other schools. Even though Pearlman had previously been accepted to Brown, his chances at these schools still remained a mystery.
“It’s very competitive [as a transfer student], and it was very unclear if I was going to be accepted [at Harvard],” Pearlman said.
In late May, Pearlman learned he was one of only thirteen transfer students accepted to Harvard. For Pearlman, Harvard was the perfect combination of high-level athletics and high-level academics. It took some time to adjust, but soon, Pearlman was feeling like a member of the team.
“Coach Fish and the team were really instrumental in making me feel comfortable, and they really provided a good environment for me,” Pearlman said. “I really like the guys, and I’m very happy that I decided to transfer.”
He’s a consummate worker,” said Harvard assistant coach Andrew Rueb. “As a coach, it’s a pleasure to have someone who can’t work hard enough.”
It seems that with this help, Pearlman has been able to play some of his best tennis. He amassed an 11-4 record this fall and consistently leads the team in the duals season at the No.1 position.
“I’m fitter than I’ve ever been, so I have a lot of confidence going into matches … in my ability to outlast opponents.
Even though he has dedicated the better half of his life to the sport, tennis is not the only passion Pearlman has. The economics concentrator also enjoys filmmaking and acting and is completing a secondary in dramatic arts.
“With the tennis schedule, obviously, there’s not enough time to do performances and audition for that, but I hope to be able to pursue that in the future at some point,” Pearlman said. “I’m going to be playing tennis after school, but if things don’t work out, I’m going to be moving directly to Hollywood.”                                                                                          —Staff writer Steven T.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past three weeks, the Harvard Nordic ski team has been trying to spread the joys of its chosen sport. The Crimson has been working with the New England Nordic Ski Association (NENSA) to teach Nordic skiing to war veterans from local VA hospitals.
“This is a sport that brings a lot of joy,” coach Chris City ’94 says. “There’s something energizing and reinvigorating about being able to go for a ski. I would hope what we do is bring that sense of being refreshed, reenergized.”
According to a NENSA press release written by Nathaniel Herz, the program is part of a larger initiative by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs to “create recreational opportunities for disabled veterans, or fund existing ones.”
When NENSA decided to start its own program, it asked Eileen Carey, then the head of the Maine Winter Sports Center, to serve as director of the Adaptive Program. Carey accepted.
“It’s a new program for both the organization and myself,” Carey explains. “In my work that I’ve done at Maine Winter Sports Center, [I worked on] making it more accessible. The work I was doing in Maine was using skiing as a way to address public health issues. I saw this is as ... a good challenge, something that I was really excited about.”
Carey is working to create a New England-wide program, but she chose to start with the Boston area, targeting three local VA hospitals and looking for volunteers.
And that’s where the Harvard ski team came in.
“In building a program ... it’s obviously important [to have] a knowledgeable volunteer base,” she explains. “That includes everything from ski instruction to medical considerations. I kind of reached out to different people. The Harvard team was a natural fit as far as having a ski background. ...They seemed really interested in helping out.”
For City and the Crimson, the decision was a no-brainer.
“Veterans are a group to which we owe a great deal,” City says. “If we can help with either ... health or providing company, maybe in some small measure we’re helping to repay the debt we owe for their service.”
The team first participated on Jan. 31 and now sends volunteers every Monday to Weston Ski Track, the team’s home course, where it meets up with veterans of various levels of mobility.
“I was working with one of the athletes who was able to stand,” freshman Tanner Wiegand says. “Some of the athletes are not as mobile.”
But while the veterans may demonstrate different levels of mobility, they have in common a desire to learn and improve.
“They’re all really motivated to learn how to ski,” Wiegand says. “I was so surprised how even though it was obviously a huge struggle, they’re motivated; they were out there in the cold.”
According to Carey, the program has been a success so far.
“The Harvard ski team has been really helpful in providing that experience,” Carey said. “I think everyone’s had a really positive experience. We’ve had some people in the program that have been able to advance their rehabilitation on skis, which has been really exciting to see.”
But the veterans are not the only ones reaping the benefits.
Both City and Wiegand stress the ways in which the program has helped the Crimson’s skiers both technically and mentally.
“This is one of my first experiences [coaching],” Wiegand says. “You don’t realize what it is you’re doing until you try to teach someone. It’s a good opportunity to look at my own skiing.”
But more than that, the program has allowed Harvard’s Nordic skiers to remind themselves of the joys of their sport in the midst of the college season.
“Sports and being an athlete can be ... very self-centered,” City says. “We can get very focused on ourselves. I think it’s really important to take a look around every now and then. It sort of puts things in perspective.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With an impressive outing at the Beanpot Invitational, Harvard’s men’s and women’s fencers put their teams on solid footing as the Crimson heads into national play at the NCAA Northeast Fencing Regionals in March.
In last night’s competition, Harvard squared off against local rivals Brandeis, MIT, and BC in a one-night marathon-style tournament in Waltham, Mass.
In last year’s Beanpot, the Crimson fencing squads dominated their local opponents, posting blowout wins against all three schools. This year proved no different, as the Harvard men and women slashed their way to a fourth consecutive Beanpot title and proved themselves to be the undisputed fencing force in the Boston area.
By night’s end, the Crimson easily came away with both titles, as the men’s team defeated the Judges, the Engineers, and the Eagles with scores of 20-7, 19-8, and 19-8, respectively, while the women won all three matches as well, 22-5, 18-9, 20-7, respectively.
“It was tough to get motivated right after winning the Ivy League championship, but everyone really stepped up and performed really well overall,” said junior sabre specialist and co-captain Valentin Staller.
With many starters resting after last weekend’s grueling competition and with many fencers seeking their final wins in order to qualify for the NCAA tournament later this month, last night’s starting lineup for the Crimson was filled with many new faces. But this did not prove to be a problem for either squad.
“We had some players who don’t really start often for the team really step up and fence very well against BU, Brandeis, and MIT,” Staller said. “So it was really nice to see how much depth we have when we have guys who aren’t regular starters win some matches.”
Harvard performed impressively as a whole, dominating its local rivals in all three weapons—foil, epee and sabre.
On the men’s side, senior foil Hao Meng, sophomore foil Tommasso di Robilant and Staller led the Crimson with strong individual efforts, each going 8-1 for the night.
On the women’s side, freshman foil Alexandra Kiefer and junior foil Shelby MacLeod each went a perfect 9-0 against opponents for the night.
“I’m especially proud of Shelby and [sophomore foil] Katherine Chou,” Keifer said. “They’ve done great this entire season, and today they had good performances.”
Kiefer’s performance at the Beanpot served as the cherry on top of what has already been an electric season, during which she has posted only four losses in over 50 matches.
Additionally, Keifer has been named one of the week’s “Primetime Performers” for Jan. 31-Feb. 6 by CollegeFencing360.com after the MIT Eric Solle Invitational in January. And just last weekend in the Ivy League Championships at Princeton, Keifer finished second overall in the foil individual standings.
“I’ve had a really great season so far, I think better than expected,” Keifer said. “It’s been really beneficial practicing with the team and gaining the support of my teammates.”
Heading into yesterday’s competition, Harvard’s history of past successes in the Beanpot served as a challenge to the team overall.
“We are sort of expected to win the Beanpot every year, but when put in a situation like that, it’s easy to get complacent and drop a few bouts,” Staller said. “But over the past week, we worked hard [and] got pumped to make sure that we would keep that trophy in our fencing room.”
This year’s Beanpot held special significance for Harvard, not only as the traditional test against local foes, but as this year’s regular season finale.
So far this season, the Crimson has shown through victories against nationally ranked teams and a men’s Ivy League title, that winning is the dominant theme and trend for this program.
With the end of the regular season, the Harvard fencers now begin a four-week long training regimen as they prepare for their next challenges during the NCAA Regionals and the eventual NCAA Championship.
“With all the tough teams we’ve faced and the tough victories overall, I’m very confident that we will be able to qualify many people for the NCAA Nationals,” Staller said. “So I’m really optimistic about Regionals next month.”
“We are going to take two days off from practice, but after that, we are heading back into the office,” he added. “We’re going to be watching video, pouring over past meets, just to work out all the kinks and make sure that we are in top form by next month.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As pitchers and catchers begin reporting to spring training for another baseball season, a former Harvard player will be among their ranks.
Frank Herrmann ’06, who made his major league debut on June 4, 2010, for the Cleveland Indians, will look to improve on a 4.03 ERA from his rookie season. The second-year pitcher is the first Crimson player to reach the big leagues since Jeff Musselman ’85 took the mound for the Toronto Blue Jays in 1986.
Herrmann pitched in 40 games last season for Cleveland, logging 44 and 2/3 innings while striking out 24, including perennial All-Stars Carl Crawford, David Ortiz, Miguel Cabrera, and even the reigning American League Most Valuable Player, Josh Hamilton. The relief pitcher posted a 3-0 record and a 0.31 ERA in 19 games for Triple-A Columbus before he was called up to Cleveland in 2010.
Herrmann is the only Harvard alumnus to appear on a club’s 40-man roster for spring training, but he isn’t the only former Crimson ballplayer with a pro contract for the upcoming season.  The Boston Red Sox announced last Friday that they had purchased the contract of Matt Kramer ’08 after he hit .346 in 20 games for the Sioux City Explorers of the independent American Association.
Kramer, who caught and played first base for Harvard and during his minor league stints, will begin the conversion to pitcher after his fastball topped out at 95 MPH on the radar gun during fall workouts with the Red Sox.
Before signing with Sioux City, Kramer, the St. Louis native, played with the Atlanta Braves organization.
Crimson coach Joe Walsh kept Kramer off the mound because of his offensive prowess and solid defensive skills. Playing in the field prevented Kramer from pitching at Harvard, but his arm impressed Boston scouts enough to give him a shot at making the transition to the rubber.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each Thursday, The Crimson will compile a series of unique statistics about Harvard's sports scene. Welcome to the Magic of Numbers—without the problem sets. We'll do the math for you.
0 – number of times Harvard has finished in the top two of the Ivy League in Men’s Basketball. It is the only Ivy League school never to have won a conference championship. At 7-1 in conference the Crimson is currently in second behind 7-0 Princeton, and the two will meet on March 5 at Lavietes Pavilion for the final regular season game.
.594 – Junior co-captain Keith Wright’s field goal percentage, good enough for first in the Ivies and 10th in the country.
89 – ESPN.com’s ranking for forward Wesley Saunders and center Kenyatta Smith, both of whom have verbally committed to the Crimson.
5.26 – Harvard’s “Simple Rating System” score, a system that takes into account point values relative to NCAA averages and strength of schedule. This is only the second time the Crimson has ever had a positive rating over the course of a season, following last year’s 1.61 rating. In 1985-86, Harvard had a minus -19.72 rating.
0.12 – The Crimson’s efficiency rating in Ivy League play so far this year, second to Princeton’s .17. ER is calculated by subtracting the points per possession allowed from the points per possession scored.
1986 – The last time the Ancient Eight was represented in the NCAA tournament by a school other than Princeton, Penn or Cornell. Brown won that year, and “Rock Me Amadeus” by Falco topped the charts. If the Crimson wins out and takes the Ivy League title, it would be the first time Harvard has made it to the NCAAs since 1946.
Always En Garde (or Fencing Success Continues)
2 – Ranking of the men’s fencing team. The Crimson has posted a 13-2 record this season, including consecutive victories in the Ivy Championships and the Beanpot. Harvard will be competing in the NCAA Regionals on March 13th.
3 – Ranking of the women’s fencing team. Like the men, the Crimson (12-4) swept the Beanpot but it couldn’t bring home the Ivies, finishing third.
6 – The number of total Ivy League titles between the two teams. The Crimson took the National Title in 2006 and will be looking to unseat twice-defending champion Penn State.
Men’s Volleyball on the Rise
1993 – The last time the Crimson beat Springfield, something they did on Monday in four sets.
.857 – Harvard’s winning percentage so far this season. Last year the Crimson went 5-21 for a winning percentage of .238.

A team of three Harvard Business School students has reached the finals of 20 sur Vin, a wine tasting and trivia contest.
The competition, first held in 2002, has traditionally included competitors from European universities. This year, American and Asian oenophiles were invited to participate as well.
Five American teams competed in the qualifying round in New York this past January. 
During the semi-finals, the team members were asked to identify various types of wine based on a blind taste test and answer trivia questions such as "where did this vineyard get its name?"
"We just had a lot of fun," said Nicole M. Pereira, a member of the HBS team. "It was a really interesting challenge to blind-taste wines."
The teams from HBS and Wharton Business School moved on to the final round, which will be held in Bordeaux, France, on June 17.
Kathryn D. Andersen, another team member, said that although she and her teammates are excited for the finals, they don't have their hearts set on gaining the grand prize.
"If we do well, we do well, and if we don't, we gave it our best effort," Andersen said.

Students whose beds are far from the Yard—Quadlings and residents of far-flung River Houses—sometimes bemoan their lack of opportunities to nap between classes. If you face this problem, worry no more. We here at Flyby have compiled a list of some of the best places on campus to catch some Zs.
 
Lamont Library
Open 24 hours on weekdays, Lamont is a popular spot to nap (intentionally or unintentionally). You'll be in good company as you snore in an armchair or drool over your laptop in a cubicle. But beware! What begins as a private snooze might be documented on one of Harvard’s creepier websites, "Sleeping at Lamont." 
Cabot Science Library
Located next door to the Greenhouse Café and in close proximity to some of Harvard's biggest lecture halls, this library's comfy leather couches and armchairs offer welcome respite for sleep-deprived pre-med students. 
The Barker Center
For some variety, exchange Cabot's science concentrators for the Barker Center's humanities crowd. As long as there are no scheduled lectures, the Thompson Room, equipped with enough couches for a horde of exhausted students, on the first floor is a perfect spot to doze. 
Law School Library
The Law School Library has two distinct advantages for exhausted students, graduate and undergraduate alike. First, the library staff doesn't check your bag on the way out, allowing for a speedy exit should you oversleep. The fourth floor also offers a collection of comfortable bean bag chairs which are perfect for a midday snooze—or an overnight stay in desperate situations. 
Ticknor Lounge
 
Do you ever worry about waking up for a 9 a.m. language class after working all night on a paper or problem set? Skip your bed and instead grab a quick nap in Boylston's Ticknor Lounge, where the bustle of students arriving at 9:07 a.m. will serve as the perfect wake up call. 
The Shuttle
 
After a long night working (a.k.a. napping) in Lamont, most Quadlings are ready to catch the shuttle and head home to their beds. Don't miss out on one last opportunity to nod off—on  the shuttle itself. Depending on the hour, the shuttle might be crowded enough to allow you to sleep standing up, or so empty that you can stretch out over an entire row. Don't worry if you oversleep; the shuttle will return to your stop every half-hour.

Displaced studiers rejoice! After closing for repairs early in the semester due to frozen drains and a leaking ceiling, the Quincy House Qube is now back in business, according to an e-mail sent over the Quincy House list. A security guard confirmed today that, barring any more heavy snowfall, the beloved Qube will be operating at normal hours for the rest of the semester.
