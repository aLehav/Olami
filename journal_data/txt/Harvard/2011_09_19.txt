After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How can dance explain the theories of physics and medicine? How does one represent benzene through dance? These are some of the questions raised by Harvard’s newest artist in residence, Elizabeth Lerman. A recipient of the 2002 MacArthur “Genius Grant” Fellowship, Lerman stepped down in 2011 from her position as Artistic Director of the Liz Lerman Dance Exchange, which she founded in 1976, and has joined the ranks of Harvard’s visiting artists. This semester, Lerman will be teaching a new Harvard course, Music 101r: “Dance Collaboration,” and conducting research for a new choreographic work focusing on the history of medicine, primarily in the Civil War. Part of her role, she says, is to encourage deeper artistic collaboration in the university community. “The idea is to get artists, put them in the middle of the campus ... and mix things up,” she says.
Music 101r uses cross-disciplinary learning methods to explore how art can be applied more broadly to education within the community. Her multifaceted approach to arts education ties into her views on the current state of both dance and academia. “I’m not so sure everything should be learned so passively ... I think there’s room for a lot more experiential learning,” she says. Lerman claims that this experiential learning does not replace lectures or class structure but instead serves as a supplement to this traditional approach. “PowerPoint is really fun for the person that makes the PowerPoint ... but how much fun is it to sit and watch someone’s slideshow?” she asks.
In her course, Lerman aims to take a quite different approach. The class is structured to allow her students, even those with no previous dance experience, to use dance as a way to spark discussions and solutions. Her Music 101r course syllabus begins: “Ask a big enough question and you will need more than one discipline to answer it ... This course asserts that artistic practice, beautiful in its own right for making art, also provides a means for being active in the world.” With this focus, Lerman’s students will spend the semester learning movement-based choreographic tools, creating their own performance works, and translating this artistic process into methods for inquiry-based problem solving that could be used in other disciplines. “Our bodies are really, really good learning mechanisms,” says Lerman, “and it is foolish for us to leave them out of the picture.” One of Lerman’s teaching fellows, Allison K. Ross—who graduated from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 2011—described Lerman’s interactions with her students: “Liz is a very focused teacher and facilitator, and [has] been giving students individualized attention,” she says.
Lerman is also involved in a number of upcoming projects at Arts @ 29 Garden, Harvard’s newest space for artistic collaboration between faculty, students, and visiting artists. Lerman first worked with Arts @ 29 Garden last winter during Harvard’s January Arts Intensives. Bess Paupeck, Program Manager of Arts @ 29 Garden, describes Lerman’s presence at the studio as an exciting addition. “Liz brings an incredible dynamic of energy, inspiration, and vision to this space. As a resident she has already brought several of her collaborators to the space—and in turn their presence here further[s] the activities of the space,” she says.
While Lerman teaches and works on her own projects, she will also be facilitating a series titled “Art in the Wider World: Performance, Practice, Action,” in which a number of guest artists will come to Arts @ 29 Garden and speak about their experiences with Harvard’s students. Speakers will include Jawole Willa Jo Zollar, founder of the Urban Bush Women troupe, and environmentalist and artist Michael Singer.
“I hope Liz will [continue to] do exactly what she is already doing,” Paupeck says.  “With her vast experience, she will contribute to the ongoing dialogue about interdisciplinary art-making happening here at Harvard and beyond.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Wynton Marsalis refuses to let the history of American musical culture remain history. Through his lectures, concerts, compositions, and extensive discography as a jazz leader, Marsalis communicates a sense of contemporary America’s deep musical heritage, which he wants to make sure we will never forget. In a lecture last Thursday night at Sanders Theatre, entitled “The Double Crossing of a Pair of Heels: The Dynamics of Social Dance and American Popular Musics,” Marsalis shifted the focus of his musical discourse to the development of American dance. “Dance is the big sister of music,” Marsalis said early in his performance. “We musicians accept that dancers came first.” Infused with miniature dance performances and overflowing with historical detail, personality, and rhetorical rhythm, Marsalis’s four and a half–hour lecture characterized American dance as one of the most fundamental expressions of freedom: despite racism, Prohibition, and McCarthy-era repression, America just can’t stop dancing.
“As a trumpet player, Wynton Marsalis is without peer,” said Quincy Jones Professor of African American Music Ingrid T. Monson in her introduction to Marsalis’s lecture. “Those of you who attended his first lecture know what I mean,” she continued. That lecture, which filled Sanders Theatre in April, dealt with the history of American popular music, allowing Marsalis to pick up his horn and wax virtuosic in all of 70 musical examples. However, for last Thursday’s lecture—the second in a series of five Marsalis is expected to give at Harvard over the next two years—he left his horn at home to ensure that the dancers were the audience’s main focus.
The dancers, each with a lengthy laundry list of accolades, easily filled the space left by Marsalis’s absent trumpet. Whether the stage featured Jared Grimes tapping machine-gunned 32nd notes, Nelida Tirado and Eddie Torres Jr. doing the triple tango, or Lou Brockman and Heather Gehring ballroom dancing like they were alone together in an empty room, the dance interludes continually garnered enthusiastic applause from the audience. At one point, dancer Sheron Wray explained the way she approaches the Charleston, concluding with a line that united the exuberance of the dancers with the essence of Marsalis’s lecture: “You’ve got to put it all in a swing and do your thing!”
Throughout his lecture, Marsalis tracked a constantly evolving narrative of American dance from the early hints of ragtime through the development of jazz and rock and roll--his tale grounded in concrete historical landmarks along the way. For example, in his descriptions of dance at the turn of the 20th century, he emphasized the importance of the dense melting pot engendered by a growing urbanite population—a phenomenon he described as “the collision of universes.” To Marsalis, American dance is the perfect index of American identity since it is imitative, competitive, and accessible to everyone. “If you were talented or lucky, maybe you could become known or inspire the next dance craze,” he said. Dance is the physical reification of the American soul, and through it, Marsalis reasons, we can understand who we are.
By the end of the lecture, however, this roiling force of American culture seemed to lose most of its momentum—to the extent that the last third of the lecture seemed little but a requiem to the dead soul of American dance. “By [the seventies], we had lost our grip on the value of social dance,” he said. This point in the lecture was punctuated by one of the weakest dance performances, in which tap virtuoso Jared Grimes lumbered around stage to Jimi Hendrix in a tedious parody of an acid tripper. The lecture concluded soon after with an open-ended suggestion that American dance continues on, despite a general lapse in the public’s appreciation of its cultural and social value. In a sense, this is the thesis of all of Marsalis’ work in cultural history, and the root of his legitimacy in today’s culture. American culture has lost touch with its roots, he argues, and he is simply trying to dig them back up to remind us.
Ultimately, the lecture communicated a positive, even empowering message: the human body still moves, music still moves us, and the American cultural identity is rusty, not broken. According to Marsalis, America can renew its dance culture; it can resurface the tradition that has lain latent for decades. University President Drew G. Faust, who invited Marsalis to Harvard in the first place, would be pleased with this conclusion. “This lecture series ties to President Faust’s idea that the arts should be more central to the Harvard experience,” said Jack Megan, director of the Office for the Arts. “Recently, through President Faust’s initiative, there’s been this flowering of activities in art-making at Harvard.” For Marsalis, as long as art is still in production, neither the American body nor the American soul can keep from moving.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth H. Warren kicked off her race for U.S. Senate, challenging the less-than-one-year Republican incumbent Scott Brown. However, Warren, a former assistant to the president and special advisor to the U.S. treasury secretary, has come under criticism for her purported lack of genuine understanding of the middle class. In a column for the Boston Herald, Holly Robichaud wrote that “as a Harvard professor married to another Harvard professor, [Warren] may find connecting with middle-class voters a tough sell.” She's also been marked as “a tax-and-spend liberal from Harvard” by the communications director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Brian Walsh. It seems that Warren's Harvard connection has become a point of near-ridicule for her opponents who paint her as a know-it-all academic.
However, Harvard affiliation should not be a scarlet letter for leaders. Rather than putting unfounded faith in the “average Joe with a truck” persona espoused by politicians, voters should prefer candidates with specialized knowledge of subject matter. International relations, economic stability, and governmental responsibility are issues that neither can nor should be handled by the unqualified. The concept that a public official with an Ivy League affiliation will only serve to meet the needs of the elite is a ridiculous generalization. Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880, pushed Congress to pass the Pure Food and Drugs Act in order to protect the public from unsafe practices by consumer goods companies. Edward M. Kennedy '56, campaigned tirelessly to reform the health insurance industry to ensure coverage for all income groups. As U.S. Senator, Chuck Schumer '71, lobbied on behalf of homeowners during the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis to prevent foreclosures and limit unfair bank policies.
These politicians were able to stand up for the middle class partly because they had educational backgrounds that contributed to a deep understanding of relevant issues. Attacks against candidates because of their Harvard affiliation only serve to undermine useful political discourse and denigrates the value of their educational background. We need intelligent leaders to make well-informed decisions that have real-world consequences for all economic classes. All voters should strive for state representatives who can utilize their expertise to adeptly fulfill their constituents' needs in the democratic system.
Additionally, at a time when markets are volatile due to double-dip recession fears and sustained high unemployment, we should seek politicians who have the necessary training and experience in economic matters. In order to alleviate market-based problems and fiscal uncertainties, the public should look up to those who have in-depth knowledge of the intersection between government and finance. Warren's academic background and research has led to her appointment to multiple critical government positions including the Congressional Oversight Panel on the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. As a person who has written over 100 scholarly articles on subjects such as fiscal responsibility within the household, her Harvard ties should not discredit her ability as an effective public servant.
Furthermore, Warren's academic work signals a commitment to the middle class—a devotion that her opponents have tried to besmirch. Warren has been one of the leading proponents of financial literacy among the public and was the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency developed to prevent deceitful or unfair practices by financial institutions. Opponents who argue that Warren is simply an “academic elite” with little connection to the middle class overlook the extensive work she has done to empower the ordinary consumer. At a time when both the public and politicians are rallying against unfair bank policies, it is antithetical that the very steward of consumer protection is being so outwardly criticized.
Ultimately, this backlash against Elizabeth Warren reflects a deeper disconnect between the public perception of Harvard and reality. Harvard is constantly satirized as institution that produces elitist students and professors who are immune and unaware of the needs of the “real world.” However, political pundits and opponents who use Harvard as a target for criticism cling to an antiquated notion of our institution as an ivory tower of exclusion. Modern-day Harvard is committed to increasing its accessibility by providing extensive financial aid opportunities as well as engaging heavily in diversity recruiting.
With students and professors who hail from a multitude of ethnic, social, religious, and economic backgrounds, Harvard has transcended its once rich-white-male-only paradigm. Politicians who use Harvard as an insult should reformulate their perceptions and find more tenable and relevant sources of criticism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, thousands of protestors flooded the streets of New York City's financial district to voice opposition to what they described as rampant corporate greed. In response, police were forced to erect barricades and allow entry only to those who could prove that they worked or lived in the area. The “Occupy Wall Street” protest was organized through social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook with a mission of replacing “corporatocracy” with democracy, dubbing the area as the “financial Gomorrah of America.” One Vietnam war veteran went so far as to describe “people on Wall Street” as “blood-sucking warmongers.”
The tendency for the public to oversimplify and characteristically cluster all financial services firms in the New   York City area overlooks the vital role that such companies play in driving the world economy forward. Of course, the eminent source of outrage is wholly evident; activist groups such as Code Pink decry the role that banking institutions played in the 2007 subprime mortgage collapse and the wealth gap that remains pervasive in the United   States. Indeed, exotic financial instruments such as collateralized debt obligations and structured investment vehicles were partly responsible for the cascading effect of mortgage defaults and the ultimate destabilization of the stock market. Considering the widespread implications of the market collapse to those not involved in fixed income trading or financial products, it seems natural to blame the architects of these devices.
However, investment banks, brokerage firms, and asset management companies play a key role in supporting the positive growth of industry and job creation. In 2009, the financial services industry contributed approximately six percent to total U.S. GDP and accounted for 16.4 percent of New York State's GDP. This statistic is understandable when considering the ultimate goal of multinational investment banks and securities firms such as Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan: to raise capital in order to support strategic business growth.
This business development ultimately increases jobs and assists in economic advancement. Access to investors is crucial to being able to grow production capacity within different industries. Without Google's 2004 initial public offering, the firm would have been unable to raise the necessary funding to expand rapidly and thereby enable the public to easily access information. Also, Facebook, the tool that protestors used to so easily come together against the financial industry, represents the benefits that a firm can achieve from financial services. Facebook's venture capital investments allowed the company to increase distribution beyond colleges and ultimately led the online connection of a generation. In January, Facebook's capital raising through Goldman Sachs allowed the company to hire more employees and even further expand its reach with the public. When businesses have more to invest, everyone becomes better off because the company can use that capital to optimize its operations. Therefore, without the very financial services firms that protestors are criticizing, their attempts to mobilize would have been difficult.
In addition to the domestic operations of investment banks, the international investments made by Wall Street firms can ultimately lead to economic development in third world countries. Foreign direct investments in countries such as India can allow even the poorest areas of the region to benefit from more effective water companies. Securities brokerage firms that provide capital to such companies should not be scolded but rather appreciated for the positive role that these institutions play in empowering communities. By providing the money necessary to promote progress within these nations, securities firms ultimately contribute to the growth of the world economy.
Financial services firms are also one of the largest sources of community development domestically. Many firms such as American Express, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and many others have promoted growth in small businesses throughout the United States, ultimately resulting in community development and job growth. These financial services firms are also committed to empowering women and diversity groups through staff recruitment and various events that allow historically disadvantaged groups access to lucrative employment opportunities. The idea that these companies are solely focused on increasing firm-wide profits and are immune to the concerns of their community is misinformed.
Ultimately, the anger of protestors arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the various ways in which financial services institutions can benefit the world economy. The proclivity to lump all individuals who work on Wall Street and label them as “blood-sucking” as these protestors have is unfair and overlooks the positive role that these companies play in each of our lives.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since there have been two pieces on what was described as the "political agenda" of the 9/11 vigil, I am happy to share the reflections I offered that night. I spoke as one person, a professor of religion whose work was transformed by the responses of religious communities to catastrophe of that day.
The morning of 9/11/2001 was startlingly beautiful. We had been House Masters at Lowell House for just two years. It was the beginning of term. When we heard a plane had flown into the World Trade Center, we rushed to the TV in the junior common room.  And as we stood there with a growing number of students, the second plane hit.  Our bewilderment and, yes, our fear grew as we learned of other planes, hijacked, in the air. We could not believe our eyes when we saw the towers fall.
By the end of the day, the whole University community gathered here in this Yard. 5000 strong, seated on the grass in the evening light.  As somber a gathering as this space has ever had. This was the beginning of a new era in our lives and would challenge the fabric of our community.
How would a student of religion, like me, even begin to track the depth of questioning, the response, the doubt, the fear?  That became the subject of my teaching that fall.  People of every religious tradition died in the twin towers, in the Pentagon, in a field in Shanksville, Penn.  For weeks, we read their stories: a Chinese restaurant worker, who had put his children through college and contributed to the Buddhist temple; a New York born Hindu stock analyst, a loving Jewish father; a devoted Catholic mother.
I had been studying America's growing religious diversity for some ten years by that time, tracking the emerging histories of new Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh communities here in America. In the days after 9/11, some of the very communities with whom I had developed relationships, were also under attack
In the early afternoon of September 11, I received an email from the Muslim Public Affairs Council and a joint statement from eleven national Muslim organizations condemning the violence as Muslims and expressing their grief and solidarity as Americans.  Their voices were not easily heard in the maelstrom of news coverage. Months later, people were still asking, “Why don’t Muslim leaders say something?"
We had our homemade violence—rifle fire that very night through the dome of the mosque in Toledo, for example. But wait! By the next day, over 2000 citizens of Toledo were holding hands in a circle of protection around the mosque to say "This is not who we are." And that story of homegrown violence and the rejection of violence would be repeated dozens of times.
Sikhs were also attacked, as we know. Our turbans made us targets, they said. A Sikh advocacy group reported of over two hundred incidents: a Sikh attacked with a baseball bat in Queens, beaten unconscious in Seattle, and assaulted at a stop light in San Diego, shot and killed in Mesa, Arizona. In those days after 9/11 the Sikh Coalition was born, to begin to educate the rest of us about their faith, and to stand for the most American of principles, their civil rights.
In that time of real vulnerability, mosques across the country held open houses, including our Islamic Center here in Cambridge. In a letter of invitation to the whole city, they said,  “God willing, we can lend one another strength to find hope in these uncertain times.” More than seven hundred people came, many of them visiting a mosque for the first time.  In Austin, Texas, hundreds showed up for the Sunday open house.  A woman interviewed by the Austin American-Statesman put it plainly for all of us when she said, “The time of not getting to know each other is over."
I remember the Jewish festival of Sukkoth that fall. The fragile booth, called the sukkah, was built, open to the sky and its sides to the wind, here at Harvard Hillel. The Jewish theologian Arthur Waskow wrote on Sukkoth, 2001: He said, "This year the ancient truth came home: We all live in a sukkah. Even the greatest oceans do not shield us; even the mightiest buildings do not shield us; even the wealthiest balance sheets and the most powerful weapons do not shield us. There are only wispy walls and leaky roofs between us."
September 11, 2001, made clear to us the deeper meanings of globalization: that our borders in this world are now but dotted lines at best. There is no strength in brick and steel, but there is strength in the relationships we build.  In the years that followed, we would see Jewish, Muslim, Christian students, students of every faith and none, gather to eat and get to know one another in the sukkah or at the iftar meals of the Islamic society during Ramadan.
This is our task, now: understanding one another and building the relationships that will guide this university, our communities, and the communities of the world into a future of hope, creating a fabric of relationship that will be too strong to rend asunder.

The name Mohamed Bouazizi ought to mean nothing. But Bouazizi, a poorly educated Tunisian street peddler, rightfully belongs in the class of history’s Jeffersons, Marxes, and Mandelas. Yet whereas those revolutionaries inspired revolutions with their ideas or ability to organize action, Bouazizi catalyzed a revolution through the only act that could aptly symbolize its lonely desperation—self-immolation.
On Dec. 17, 2010 26 year-old Bouazizi, in protest of the confiscation of his wares, poured gasoline on his body, and lit a match. He died 17 days later in a hospital bed. Ten days afterwards, Tunisian President Zine Ben Ali became a permanent resident of Saudi Arabia. Bouazizi’s final words before lighting himself on fire were not Georges-Jacques Danton’s haughty “Thou wilt show my head to the people; it is worth showing” or William Wallace’s bold “Freedom!” but instead were the banal “How do you expect me to make a living?”
Future sociologists will notice that the most recurrent metaphor in the media for the Arab Spring was a wave crashing or an explosion. Both imply an unsustainable rise of tension eventually coalescing into a thunderous social movement. This prescribes far too much inevitability to the event. Without Bouazizi, our Western “experts” on the region may still be happily repeating their forty-year-old conventional truths about the region’s supposedly systemic and stubborn authoritarianism. There was nothing inevitable in the Arab Spring, but there were conditions, both recent and ancient, that made revolution possible. Not coincidentally, the story of Mohamed Bouazizi is a fitting place to begin to understand the Arab Spring.
By multiple accounts, Mohamed Bouazizi lived modestly. He cared for an extended family and barely met the costs of living by selling vegetables from an unlicensed cart. He was frustrated with his poverty and he was not alone. Although Tunisia’s Gross Domestic Product rose from 2008 to 2010, Tunisians’ perceptions of their own economic wellbeing dropped during the same period.
State services are, like in most of the Arab world, quite expansive, and reliance on state-provided housing and healthcare remains  despite their poor condition. Over the one-year period from 2009 to 2010 the satisfaction rates in Tunisia for housing and healthcare collapsed from 74 percent to 41 percent and 71 percent to 51 percent respectively. Clearly, an internal bureaucratic collapse precipitated the susceptibility of Tunisians to revolution. Bouazizi rushed to the governor’s office after the confiscation of his food scales. He lit himself on fire only when he felt mistreated by the government and his finals words were aimed directly at the government. This is only an indication of how high expectations for the distribution of state services could no longer be met thanks to shifts in demographics and a stagnant domestic and global economy
Mohamed Bouazizi also reflects an equally troubling problem of the Middle East—a failure to tap youth potential. Unsurprisingly, there appears to be a fairly strong positive correlation between those countries where youth felt their country “maximized youth potential” and the numbers of riots. According to a Silatech Index-Gallup study conducted last year, 77 percent of Egyptians are unhappy with the number of quality and available jobs and 69 percent of young Arabs say they are dissatisfied with government efforts to ameliorate unemployment. Poignantly, although the number of Arabs who prefer government employment to private employment is high—52 percent versus 23 percent—young Americans are more likely to have a favorable opinion of entrepreneurs than any other region. Those are the statistics of a broken system.
During Tunisia’s riots in January, a platitude among Middle East analysts was that Tunisia, with its wealthy and educated elite, was more prone than the rest of the Arab World to political liberalization. But, Bouazizi never graduated from high school and the town of Sidi Bouzid was no bastion of high education or wealth. Much smaller protests had occurred in Tunisia before the events of this year. Most upper class and educated Tunisians, even those that passionately desire a freer Tunisia, had too much to lose by demanding change. Change occurred when the Bouazizis of Tunisia realized it could.
This situation repeated itself across the Arab world. For decades, the educated and wealthy elites have organized pathetically small protests. The political awakening of an upset and unemployed lower class was the true impetus and guide for the Arab Spring. Perhaps rebirth is a more fitting term than awakening. After all, the period of decolonization begun by the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 already merits the distinction of being the Arab lower classes’ first true political awakening. But, in many cases, expectations were not met and local tyrants replaced distant tyrants.
To view the Arab Spring as inevitable or amorphous is to fail to prepare for a safer and freer future. Demographic, economic, and youth-related issues remain regardless of who holds political authority. Although Bouazizi can no longer play a political role, the awakened lower class can and must. Otherwise, Bouazizi will mean nothing.

A Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 615 delegation of nine Harvard Law School custodians went to Dean Martha L. Minow’s office on Friday afternoon to ask for an investigation into new, allegedly discriminatory management practices toward workers.
Although Minow was not in her office, the delegation from SEIU—the union which represents Harvard custodial workers—submitted a letter to Minow’s assistant with a list of complaints and asked for a response within 10 days.
Jeb Mays, an interpreter for SEIU, said that the delegation was formed in reaction to new management practices implemented six months ago. Mays said the recent policy changes are disrespectful towards workers and create a fearful work environment.
“People have been told they are no longer allowed to be seen not working,” Mays said. “That they are not able to buy food from the cafe or sit down or that they are not allowed into the new building. And longtime workers have been told that they are gone for no reason.”
The SEIU’s letter to Minow attributes the policy changes to a new administrator hired six months ago.
“Since her arrival, new and discriminatory policies have been implemented and people have been arbitrarily removed,” the letter reads. “It has become so bad that we have taken the extraordinary step of sending this delegation to your office today.”
The University said it will investigate the union’s claims and then take the appropriate action.
“Because this matter involves employees of the University, the Law School will work closely with the University’s labor relations staff to insure a thorough review in accordance with the applicable union contract and University policy,” said Robb London, a spokesperson for the Law School.
Mays said that Local 615 and workers felt that sending an unannounced delegation to the Law School was the best way to assure that they were heard.
“Setting up meetings, that takes a really long time,” Mays said. “And if people don’t want to deal with you, they’ll shove you to the side. With a group like this, though, you are very likely to get noticed.”
Workers said that conditions have gotten to a point where they dread coming to work.
“It’s really gotten rough,” said Sergio Dueñas, one of the organizers of the event and a Law School custodial worker. “We want a change.”
Workers said they were disappointed that Minow was not in her office, but added that they felt the visit still had value.
“It was the right thing to do,” said Wayne, a custodial worker in the Law School who did not want to disclose his last name. “I think it was definitely worth it.”
Mays said that although the delegation did not meet with Minow this time, they will continue their effort to address unsatisfactory working conditions.
“We told them they have to get back to us in 10 days,” Mays said. “Sometimes it takes these places a while to realize that we won’t just go away. If they don’t respond, we’ll be back.”

Due to the March earthquake that devastated much of northeastern Japan, Jun Shepard ’14 found out that her internship at the Tokyo Gas Company was cancelled.
But unlike many other students with internship offers in Japan who decided to work elsewhere, Shepard decided to join the relief effort.
“I wasn’t afraid because I’ve been in earthquakes before in Japan,” said Shepard, who is part-Japanese and a native Japanese speaker. “I was pretty well aware about the entire process.”
Shepard spent six weeks this past summer in northeastern Japan, where she spent two weeks collecting food donations from Tokyo citizens and four weeks distributing items and assisting with temporary housing. She spoke about her project last Friday in a panel discussion about Harvard-affiliated summer rebuilding efforts in Japan.
The panel, sponsored by Harvard’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies, which funded Shepard’s internship, also featured Yusuke Tsugawa, a doctor who co-founded the Boston-Japan Medical Research Initiative; Miho Mazereeuw, a Graduate School of Design lecturer; and Glenn T. Bogardus ’12, who worked to seek funding from foreign aid organizations.
The panelists agreed that the effects of radiation exposure and the unstable financial climate would present long-term challenges for Japan beyond the present relief efforts.
“There needs to be more [radiation] research to come up with answers that people trust,” said Mazereeuw, who worked with Graduate School of Design students to build a community center.
Shepard said people need to accept that economic assistance may be the most effective means of supporting recovery efforts.
“The unemployment rate is skyrocketing, especially in the fishing industry,” she said, adding that fundraising and promoting industrial growth are critical ways to help.
“You heard so much about stoicism and endurance last March and April, but clearly there’s a limit to that,” said Andrew D. Gordon, a history professor and event moderator.
The Japanese government issued a report stating that the suicide rate rose 39 percent in the Miyagi region, an area that was particularly ravaged by the earthquake. Even in Tokyo, which was not in the disaster zone, suicides were 27 percent higher.
Unlike Shepard, Bogardus spent most of his time in an office in Tokyo, where he helped translate files that were sent to foreign aid organizations.
“When I signed up for a volunteer job, I had a romantic vision of being on the ground, helping and getting dirty and gritty,” he said. “It became clear to me that there are endless amounts of Japanese people who are already helping and doing it very well.”
He added that he realized that he would be most helpful by “working in this office and acquiring the resources that were necessary to help the recovery effort.”
Gordon, who is the director of the Reischauer Institute, said the institute will continue to fund students to assist with recovery efforts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former directors of the Harvard Institute of Politics admonished today’s campaign finance system for setting a divisive tone in politics at a panel discussion Friday.
The panel members agreed that many of the problems in politics today are associated with politicians’ connections to special interests.
“Unfortunately, everyone in Washington is deeply indebted to deep-pocketed institutions, whether they be corporations, unions, or individuals,” said Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities and former Congressman Jim Leach.
Discussing the constant search in politics for campaign contributions, former Secretary of Agriculture Daniel R. Glickman noted how much campaign costs have increased since he ran for Congress in 1976—and how this can make officials indebted to those who support them.
“People do not give you money because they like your hairline or the way you look. They give you money because they want access and hopefully influence,” he said.
Leach added that he believes last year’s Citizens United Supreme Court decision, which stipulated that corporations should be legally treated like citizens under campaign finance laws, contributes to the problem.
“This has to be reversed, and it can only be reversed by the Court changing its mind, by new members of the Court, or by a constitutional amendment,” Glickman added. “The public has to say that this truly, truly matters.”
While much of the criticism centered around campaign finance, the panelists also noted cultural shifts.
U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said she sees the aggressive discourse in politics as a symptom of a larger social problem.
“It’s always the people who are most difficult, the most outspoken, who seem to be the stars,” she said. “It’s not just politics—it’s our whole public dialogue that I feel has gotten too destructive.”
Shaheen also stressed the need to address the issue and to find a way to make the public trust government.
“[We need to show] that those of us who are political leaders are adults,” she said.
The panel was titled “Civility in Politics: Is There Hope?”
“We did subtitle this, ‘Is There Hope?’ I haven’t heard a lot of hope,” joked current IOP Director C.M. Trey Grayson ’94.
But solutions to many of the structural problems facing the nation are possible through a combination of traditional organization and modern networking tools, said former Congressman Philip R. Sharp.
“The truth is, we are not in a rut we cannot get out of,” Sharp said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is a household name for politics—but not just in America.
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Winston A. Tubman, two Harvard graduates who maintain strong ties to the University, are competing for the presidency of Liberia in an election to be held on Oct. 11.
Sirleaf, the current president of Liberia and a 1971 graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, was the University’s Commencement speaker last spring.
Tubman, who earned a degree from Harvard Law School in 1966, returned to Cambridge last weekend for the Celebration of Black Alumni conference.
The conference, themed “Struggle and Progress: Leadership in the 21st Century,” brought together black Law School alumni from around the world for discussions and events. Tubman sat on a panel about the human rights agenda in Africa with other black leaders, including former Ambassador to Nigeria Walter C. Carrington.
In an interview Saturday, Tubman said he returned to Cambridge less than a month before his nation’s election because he believes Liberia’s relationship with Harvard is important for the country’s development.
Tubman explained that he hopes Liberia will become a place that young black professionals—like those graduating from Harvard—will consider as a potential location to live and work.
He said he hopes to “be able to reach out to all my friends and say ‘Look, I have this big job to do, and I need all the help from all my friends—including my influential powerful friends from Harvard.’”
The relationship between Harvard and Liberia reaches back to the 19th century. Simon Greenleaf, a Harvard professor, drafted Liberia’s constitution in 1847. A little more than a century later, in 1951, Joseph R. Grimes, a graduate of the Law School, founded Liberia’s first law school.
Tubman said that Harvard and the U.S. feel a special bond to Liberia because of “the tie of blood”—a reference to the thousands of American slaves who returned to Liberia after emancipation.
“One of the reasons that I came [to Harvard], in what I hope to be the prelude to my presidency, is that when that presidency materializes, we’ll find practical ways by which Harvard can continue what it began all those years ago,” Tubman said.
Tubman is not the only politician with a Harvard Law School degree who is making a bid for high office this year.
Last spring, graduate Lobsang Sangay was elected as the Prime Minister of the Tibetan government in exile. Barack Obama and President of the Republic of China Ma Ying-jeou also graduated from the Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The beginning of the fall semester brings the start of final club recruitment and with it, a sense of anticipation as sophomores wonder if they will be one of the “punched.”
But last Monday, a number of undergraduates received a different type of letter under their door. The envelope didn’t bear the seal of a final club, nor did the note inside invite the recipient to an exclusive punch event.
The letter, sent to sophomore males, instead asked students “to consider not punching a final club this fall.”
Sabrina G. Lee ’12, one of the students involved in the campaign, said that the project’s goal was to encourage “discourse” about final clubs and the punch process.
“Raising awareness about why people shouldn’t join final clubs is important,” Lee said. “For some students that I’ve talked to that are punching final clubs, the information that’s out there isn’t that great.”
The letter asked recipients to consider “exclusivity, “gender discrimination,” “unequal access to social space on Harvard’s campus,” and “lack of transparency” when deciding whether or not to punch a final club.
“I don’t anticipate [the letter] to end punch,” said Carolyn W. Chou ’13, one of the campaign’s organizers. “I just think that it’s important to have other voices around the issue of final clubs.”
Chou said that the group wanted to replicate the “symbolic” nature of the letter-under-the-door ritual employed by final clubs in the annual punch process.
She added the group chose to target sophomore males “because of the access to space and wealth that is given to male final clubs but not universally accessible to female final clubs.”
The group attempted to deliver letters to as many male students as possible, but Chou said that—given that there were fewer than a dozen students involved in the project—it was likely that some sophomores may have been missed. Several students interviewed for this story said that they had neither received the letter nor heard of the project.
Of those who had received a letter, some said that they appreciated the group’s mission while others said that they failed to see the point.
But the organizers said they hoped that at least some students who received the letter will think seriously about the role that final clubs play in Harvard’s social scene.
Lee said this year’s campaign echoed the sentiments of a similar effort last year that sent fliers to almost every Harvard undergraduate, regardless of class or gender, inviting them to “NOT join a final club.”
Though that group was later absorbed by the larger student group “Students for Safe Social Space,” Lee, who is also a part of Students for Safe Social Space, said that there were still some members who prioritized the original message discouraging students from joining final clubs.
“I definitely know that people remain interested in this issue,” Lee said of the campaign against final clubs. “It can be important to give voice to the side that is not too frequently heard.”

A tell-all book leaked over the weekend is stirring controversy due to its portrayal of the Obama White House during the financial crisis as rife with internal conflict and jockeying between economic bigwigs, including former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers.
Many of those interviewed for the book have since denied quotes and rejected the narrative’s accuracy.
The book—written by former Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskind—is called “Confidence Men: Wall Street, Washington, and the Education of a President.”
Though it officially goes on sale Tuesday, several news organizations received copies of the book in advance.
Citing White House documents, the book claims that Obama’s decisions were often “relitigated” by Summers, who was chairman of the National Economic Council at the time.
“The administration’s domestic policy was fast becoming a debate society run by Larry Summers,” Suskind writes.
Summers responded in a comment sent by email to Politico on Saturday, saying “the hearsay attributed to me is a combination of fiction, distortion, and words taken out of context. I can’t speak to what others have told Mr. Suskind, but I have always believed that the president has led this country with determined, steady, and practical leadership in the economic area.”
In the book Suskind wrote, “Enough was enough, [White House Chief of Staff] Rahm Emanuel decided ... He summoned the two competing super-egos, Summers and [budget director Peter] Orszag, and told them to make peace. After all, they were each responsible for huge swaths of the federal government. And they were fighting at every turn.”
According to the book, Summers also questioned Obama’s leadership, saying to Orszag, “We’re home alone. There’s no adult in charge. Clinton would never have made these mistakes.”
The book also paints a picture of the White House as a boys’ club in which women were routinely ignored or left out, although some women interviewed now deny that portrayal.
Suskind writes, “‘The president has a real woman problem’ was the assessment of another high-ranking female official. ‘The idea of the boys’ club being just Larry and Rahm isn’t fair. He [Obama] was just as responsible himself.’”
In Suskind’s book, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Christina D. Romer is quoted as saying “I felt like a piece of meat” after being excluded by Summers at a meeting.
Romer later denied that comment and said, “I can’t imagine I ever said that.”
Romer allegedly also said to Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren—now a candidate for the U.S. Senate—that she felt women were forced to assert authority in the White House work environment.
“Why is it always the women?” Romer asked, according to Suskind’s book. “Why are we the only ones with the balls around here?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update: 4:21 a.m.
Credit Suisse CEO Brady W. Dougan struck a mostly optimistic tone about the state of the global economy at a discussion aimed at recruiting Harvard students at the Faculty Club Monday afternoon.
In his pitch for Credit Suisse, Dougan credited the bank’s ability to stay afloat during the economic crisis of 2008 to its client-oriented approach to finance.
Credit Suisse was one of 30 financial institutions from the top 100 banks that did not receive government aid after the crash, according to Dougan.
“Our business model has proved perfectly suited for this economy,” he said. “We were partly lucky, partly smart.”
In spite of the unpredictable economic climate, Dougan encouraged students to consider careers in finance, noting that the upheaval has opened up the possibility for more creative thinking in the field.
“The structure is changing, and it creates opportunities for people coming in at entry levels with fresh perspective,” Dougan said.
Still, Credit Suisse this summer announced it would cut up to 2,000 jobs. And some other financial firms that normally recruit extensively on campus have cut back or cancelled hiring programs this year.
Credit Suisse Campus Relations Manager Betsy Covitt, who organized the event in conjunction with the Veritas Financial Group, said that the bank was still enthusiastic about recruiting on Harvard’s campus.
“To give a whole day to recruiting efforts is a real commitment to Harvard as a university,” Covitt said, noting that the event was unique to Harvard.
Deborah Carroll, Director of On-Campus Interview and Employer Relations at the Office of Career Services, said that a large number of firms are still recruiting on campus, a fact she attributed to the University’s prestigious reputation.
“In this economy we are fortunate to be Harvard,” she said.
“We are fortunate that these high level executives want to talk to Harvard students.”
The President of Veritas Financial Group, Pim Valantagul ’13, echoed these sentiments.
“I would never get a chance like this outside of Harvard,” she said.
The program on Monday is expected to be the first of many between Credit Suisse and Harvard students this year.
The session marked the second time that Dougan has come to Harvard, following an event last October.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team started its new season off on the right foot this weekend, claiming a victory at the two-day Yale Women’s Intercollegiate, besting second-place Longwood University by 16 shots.
Looking to start fresh after failing to win a tournament all last season, the Crimson traveled to New Haven, Conn., where it expected to find a challenge, as the host Bulldogs are defending Ivy League champions, and the Course at Yale is a notably demanding one.
“It’s definitely a fun course, especially in terms of difficulty,” explained sophomore and Crimson business board member Bonnie Hu.
“When we got to the course, we already knew that the course was one of the best in the world,” freshman Tiffany Lim added. “We were really excited to get the chance to play on it.”
To take down 15 other schools—including Ivy rivals Brown and Yale—on such a tricky course was especially meaningful.
“I’m obviously very pleased with the win,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Especially the first tournament of the season, especially at a very good golf course ... against the reigning Ivy League champions.”
The Crimson was able to establish a lead on the first day of the tournament and hold on for the wire-to-wire victory, as it totaled a three-day score of 894—16 fewer strokes than second-place Longwood and 19 fewer than Nova Southeastern University.
The Crimson looked sharp from the first tee, finishing with a five-shot lead after the first 18 holes and a 13-stroke advantage after 36 holes.
“Day one is a marathon,” Rhoads said. “To play well throughout the entire day is a big challenge.”
But day two proved to be more challenging than the first, as evidenced by a general increase in scores—all 16 squads shot their worst performances in the third round—which Rhoads attributed to exhaustion and a more difficult course.
“Course play was a little more difficult, and people were worn out after a 36-hole day,” Rhoads said. “It’s difficult to walk, and it takes a lot out of people.”
“The configurations were definitely harder. We had a couple extended holes by putting the tees back further,” Hu explained. “It was a bit quite windier today, so the holes felt even longer.”
The margins between the teams stayed relatively the same, however.
“I’m not surprised that the scores were a bit higher, but it wasn’t because we weren’t doing our job or what we came to do,” Rhoads said. “We still came away with our victory.”
Individually, it was Lim who led the charge for the Crimson.
Lim, who was named the nation’s sixth-ranked incoming freshman by Golfweek Magazine, has lived up to the hype so far. She fell to second place in the individual standings due to a technicality, as she and Yale sophomore Seo Hee Moon—the reigning Ivy Rookie of the Year—were just two-over for the three rounds.
In lieu of playing more holes as a tiebreaker, their first round scores were compared to determine the winner, and so Lim finished in second place for the tournament.
Harvard’s other freshman, Brenna Nelson, tied for 11th place.
“When the freshmen arrive, they are coming off an extensive competitive program. They come in sharp because they are working hard in the offseason,” Rhoads said.
“The freshmen are great. Both are traveling and are really fitting in well with us,” Hu added. “It helps us on the course with tournaments, even though it’s a fairly individual sport.”
Also contributing to the victory were Hu, who tied for fifth, captain Christine Cho (10th), and senior Jane Lee (tie for 24th). “It was a really good team effort. You can’t come close to a win without everyone contributing,” Rhoads said.
After not winning a tournament since April 2010, the team’s hopes are riding high.
“Last year was a hard year because we had a bunch of seconds, but we didn’t quite get into the winner’s circle,” Rhoads explained. “They came out with a lot of motivation, and I give them a lot of credit.”
Next stop on the schedule for the Crimson is the Princeton Invitational this coming weekend.
“This is just the beginning.” Lim said. “We have a lot more to put out there, and I’m really excited for what we do the rest of the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In just over 24 hours at the North-South Tournament in Annapolis, Md., Harvard men’s water polo faced three challenging matchups, including a tournament opener against East Coast powerhouse Bucknell (3-1) on Saturday afternoon.
Despite falling to the Bisons in a lopsided 18-8 decision, the Crimson turned things around later the very same day against Mercyhurst (5-2).
Still reeling after its opener, Harvard battled tough and picked up a convincing 18-7 win before closing out the weekend the next morning with a 10-8 loss to the Navy “B” squad.
The Crimson is still looking to find its rhythm.
With a solid senior presence, an experienced core of returning players, and a formidable freshman class, the pieces are in place.
But due to the absence of senior co-captain Luka Babic in the pool, those pieces have yet to come together to form a cohesive, winning unit.
Babic’s injury, a 15-stitch facial laceration suffered two weekends ago, left the Crimson shorthanded in its three most recent games.
Without the senior leader, the Crimson’s ups and downs continued this weekend.
NAVY 10, HARVARD 8
In the final game of the weekend, Harvard found itself on the losing end of a matchup with Navy’s “B” squad.
Despite playing its third shorthanded game in just over 24 hours, the Crimson put together a solid effort, gaining valuable experience for its freshman class.
“It was a great learning experience ... we regrouped from the mistakes we made in the past and improved on those, and figured out a few things we need to tweak before heading into conference play next week,” senior goalie Alex Popp said.
Harvard was very slow off the block, remaining scoreless well into the second quarter, despite earning a five-meter penalty shot opportunity in the opening stanza.
Freshman two-meter John Holland-McCowan finally put the Crimson on the board and swung the momentum his squad’s way.
Harvard dominated in the mid-game play and fought its way back to a 5-4 lead by the third quarter.
Unfortunately, the Crimson lost its grip on the match, as Navy then went on a powerful run of its own to jump ahead, 10-6.
Harvard scored two last minute goals, but its efforts proved fruitless, as it closed out the weekend with a second loss.
HARVARD 17, MERCYHURST 8
Mercyhurst entered the day undefeated but left with two defeats—one of which came in the form of a Harvard blowout. Midway through the first quarter, Harvard trailed, 4-1, but eventually settled down defensively, only giving up four more goals over the remainder of the game.
Without senior attacker Luka Babic, Harvard turned to its strong freshmen class for contributions.
Harvard coach Ted Minnis praised the performance of Holland-McCowan in this game.
“Against Mercyhurst, [he] had a great all-around game ... He probably played his best collegiate game thus far,” Minnis said.
In the decisive effort, Harvard’s defense congealed and brought a better energy to the pool compared to its morning matchup.
“Our intensity was there; we really focused on the defensive end,” Minnis said.
BUCKNELL 18, HARVARD 8
Harvard’s weekend opened with a rude welcoming from the Bison. Bucknell (3-1) entered the matchup undefeated, and kept on rolling.
The Crimson suffered from a slow start, falling behind, 5-0, after just a quarter.
“We didn’t play our best against Bucknell,” Minnis said. “They’re a very good team, but we made a lot of errors.”
Harvard put up an improved effort in the second and third quarters, trailing each by only one goal.
Bucknell closed the game in similar fashion to the way it has played all year—by dominating.
The Bison spread the wealth, with six players scoring multiple goals. Senior co-captain Spencer Richly scored four goals, and teammate Alex Nowlin had a team-high six points with three goals and three assists.
Throughout the game, Harvard struggled with penalties, giving up eight 6-on-5 opportunities. The Bisons converted five of the eight man-advantage chances.
Despite being overpowered by Bucknell’s transitional speed and precision, Minnis emphasized that the team didn’t leave empty-handed.
“We learned some lessons from it and hopefully we’ll grow as a team from it,” Minnis said.

After falling in a difficult final match to Northeastern (10-2), the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-3) finished second overall at the Harvard Invitational this past weekend. With wins on Friday and Saturday, the Crimson finished its first home tournament of the year with a 2-1 record as it prepares to begin the Ivy League slate.
NORTHEASTERN 3, HARVARD 1
Matched up against their toughest opponent in the last match of the tournament, the Harvard women suffered a disappointing loss, falling, 24-26, 25-20, 25-18, and 25-21. Although the Crimson was able to edge out the Huskies in the first set, it could not overcome the strong serves and seemingly flawless attacks executed by Northeastern all night. Although both teams entered the final match without dropping a set, it was the Crimson that was unable to continue the momentum it had built over its wins on the weekend.
“It was the first team we had seen that didn’t make a lot of errors,” sophomore Erin Cooney said.
The Crimson fought hard in the first set, highlighted by impressive hits by junior Taylor Docter and a final kill by sophomore Teresa Skelly.
But after its initial win in the first frame, Harvard could not overcome the service errors and ball control problems that plagued it throughout the remainder of the match. Once Northeastern took the lead in the second set, it built upon it, winning the next three games and taking the tournament title.  The Crimson put up the most fight in the fourth and final set, taking a 21-20 lead off of a kill from Docter. But Harvard was unable to keep the control of the match when the Huskies posted three consecutive kills to put them up for good, after which two service aces sealed the Crimson’s fate.
“We went point for point with them, but they had better ball control,” coach Jennifer Weiss said. “Northeastern was an aggressive serving team ... We learned a lot from playing them.”
Despite the loss, two Harvard players—Cooney and co-captain Christine Wu—were recognized for their contributions over the weekend, garnering spots on the All-Tournament team.
“It’s really exciting,” Cooney said. “It’s the first type of honor I’ve gotten ... it was a really good weekend.”
The accolade was nothing new for the veteran Wu, who has earned All-Tournament recognition in every competition in which she has played this season.
HARVARD 3, NAVY 0
In its first game on Saturday, the Crimson came out hard against Navy (4-10), just as it had done on Friday night against Holy Cross.  Harvard never gave up a set, shutting the Mids out with 25-17, 25-10, and 25-16 set victories.
Navy had two attack errors in the first few plays of the game, putting the Crimson up immediately.
A mixture of quality serves by co-captain middle blocker Sandra Lynne Fryhofer and well-constructed attacks by Harvard led the team to an early victory, completed with a final kill by Docter.
Navy built up a 7-3 lead against the Crimson in the second, but Harvard didn’t give in. A combination of freshman libero Sindhu Vegesena, sophomore setter Natalie Doyle, and Fryhofer got the Crimson back on track to take the second set from Navy. A similar situation arose in the third set, when the Mids build an early four-point lead, but Harvard was able to battle back again. Wu stepped up to the line and launched nine fantastic serves in a row, turning the score around. Docter, Casey, and Fryhofer continued to hit kill after kill, closing the game against the Mids.
HARVARD 3, HOLY CROSS 0
On Friday night, the Crimson came out on top with a shutout win against Holy Cross (4-8), defeating the Crusaders, 25-12, 25-22, and 25-17.
Casey had a strong series of serves in the first set of the game, which was ended by Skelly’s final kill.
Although the Crusaders came ready to fight in the second set—narrowing the gap in the score—Harvard refused to let them take the lead.
When Holy Cross was caught out of rotation, putting the score at 24-22, the Crimson seized the opportunity to finish the second set. The Crusaders took an early lead in the final set, but Harvard came back with a succession of kills from Casey, sophomores Skelly and Cooney, and Docter to seal their victory against Holy Cross.
It was the second time in two weeks that Holy Cross and the Crimson had been pitted against each other. Harvard blanked the Crusaders on both occasions.
“We’ve played Holy Cross already, so we knew their tendencies,” Wu said. “We did an even better job of playing Harvard volleyball and playing in our system.”
The Crimson will move into its Ivy season on Saturday when it faces Ancient Eight rival Dartmouth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last year, the Harvard men’s golf team travelled to the Bethpage Red Course in Farmingdale, N.Y., for the McLaughlin and came away with a school record for lowest team score ever in a three-round tournament.
This past weekend, the Crimson had hoped to build off last year’s success—as well as last weekend’s strong showing against Yale and Princeton—in the team’s second event of the season.
Although Harvard did not fare as well as it did last season, the team was able to finish the weekend in eighth place, with a total score of 861 strokes.
“Our performance wasn’t bad, but unfortunately, we didn’t play well enough, we all kind of played about 75 percent, which is not good enough to win,” said captain Tony Grillo, whose two-day performance placed him in a tie for 26th. “We were hoping to do better, but it’s not a terrible start to the season—it’s a consistent start.”
“Nobody really caught fire during the tournament, and that’s what we need to win,” he added.
Hosted by St. John’s and featuring a mix of 18 Ivy and non-Ivy teams, the McLaughlin is held on the Red Course of Bethpage State Park, which contains four other courses. The Black Course was the site of the 2002 and 2009 U.S. Open.
“To be honest, the course was probably the easiest we play all year, in terms of set-up and the conditions. That’s why we’re disappointed we didn’t take it lower,” Grillo said.
The tournament began on Friday under fairly moderate weather, with only a little wind and clear skies, for the most part.
The Crimson shot a 285 in the opening round, finishing in a tie for fourth place, but 11 strokes off leader (and eventual champion) Western Florida.
Leading the team in the first round were sophomore Theo Lederhausen and freshman Akash Mirchandani, who each shot par rounds of 70. They were followed by sophomore Seiji Liu (71), senior Mark Pollak (74), and Grillo (75).
In the second round that afternoon, the Crimson ended the day with 288, putting the team 25 strokes off the lead.
Grillo had a team-low of 68 that round.
“I caught fire,” he said. “We just need more of that.”
Following the captain’s lead, Lederhausen, Pollak, Mirchandani, and Liu finished their second rounds by shooting 72, 73, 75, and 76, respectively.
On Saturday, under similar conditions, Harvard shot a total of 288 again, demonstrating the team’s overall consistency.
“We had guys step up in different rounds,” Lederhausen said. “Some of us would play well in one round, while others would play well in another.”
This time Pollak led the way with a score of 70. Mirchandani shot a 71; Grillo shot a 72, and both Lederhausen and Liu shot 75s.
Grillo had the best combined score on the team, with a 215 for the three rounds to put him five-over for the tournament.
Mirchandani was another bright spot for the Crimson this weekend, finishing second overall on the team and only one shot behind Grillo with a 216—good for six over par and a tie for 28th place.
“Akash was great,” the captain noted. “For him, this tournament was definitely a positive. It’s a good way to start off for Harvard golf. I think the more he gets comfortable as the year moves on, he’ll start to post some low scores that should definitely help the team.”
The Crimson finished the weekend 21 shots over par—one fewer than Columbia and 13 fewer than Princeton. Dartmouth was the only Ivy League program to finish better than Harvard, posting a 17-over-par 857 and finishing in sixth.
“We consider ourselves to be a team that on a hard course we’ll play well, and on a easy course, we don’t always take it as low as we need to, Grillo said. “So this may have not been our tournament to win, but hopefully as the year goes on we’ll play some harder courses and that consistent performance will definitely help us.”
The Crimson will look to continue its consistent play next weekend at the MacDonald Cup, hosted by Yale.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard men’s soccer team got a taste of both the  excitement and the pain that can come from the ball being blasted into  the back of the net as the clock dwindles down.
On Friday night, the Crimson (2-3-0) defeated  University of Massachusetts (1-5-0), 1-0, on a penalty kick in overtime before falling to Vermont (5-1-0) by the same score in Sunday afternoon’s match.
As Harvard’s season progresses, it will need to maintain its offensive threat and defensive strength throughout the entire 90 minutes and to successfully convert its chances in front of the net.
But with some strong freshman additions to its solid returning roster, the Crimson should have the players on the field it needs to earn positive results.
TWO SIDES OF THE COIN
Harvard’s results this weekend demonstrated the importance of mental toughness and playing strong throughout all 90 minutes of the game and more.
The Crimson started off the weekend on a high note against the Minutemen, minimizing defensive errors and keeping UMass out of its net throughout both regulation and overtime. Harvard ultimately emerged as the victor, with freshman forward Michael Innocenzi drawing a foul in the box less than four minutes into the first overtime period and junior co-captain Scott Prozeller calmly converting the penalty kick for the win.
“What I’m really happy with … is that we didn’t concede a goal,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “A lot of times what happens in games like that where you are the aggressor, you can overextend yourself offensively and open yourself up to counterattacks, and you can take really disappointing losses like that … Overall, it’s a huge mental step for our group to lock them out of our net for an entire game and throughout overtime.”
But it was a mental step that wouldn’t last throughout the weekend.
Although both teams had good chances, it was the Catamounts that gained the upper hand in Sunday’s match against Harvard. The Vermont defense held strong against the Crimson’s offensive pressure, and with only five minutes remaining in regulation, Catamount senior Yannick Lewis headed in a long throw from his teammate for the game-winning tally.
“We were putting up a really great defensive effort up until five minutes left when we had one mental slip-up that cost us the game,” junior forward Brian Rogers said.
Four of Harvard’s five games this season have been decided on goals scored in the final 13 minutes of the contest, showing that one defensive breakdown can cost a match for any team and highlighting the importance of maintaining your offensive and defensive strength throughout the entire period.
NOT ENOUGH FIREPOWER
With its one goal of the weekend coming from a penalty kick by Prozeller in overtime against the Minutemen, its time for the Crimson’s offense to start finding the back of the net.
But it’s not for a lack of trying.
Against Massachusetts, Harvard outshot its opponents, 15-5, and had a strong hold on possession throughout the game, but the squad was unable to put a tally on the scoreboard from the flow of play.
In a more evenly-matched contest against Vermont, the Catamounts had the slight edge with 10 shots to the Crimson’s eight, and Harvard’s inability to convert its opportunities and a mental lapse in the defense led to its ultimate defeat.
The Crimson has generally been able to get shots off in its matches so far but is having less luck in putting the ball away, scoring only two goals from matchplay in its five contests—both coming from Rogers.
It’s something the team hopes to change in games to come.
“Anytime you get shutout, it is frustrating,” Junot said. “We had enough chances where we could have and should have scored a goal. But, I don’t think it is an overall team frustration. We never felt as if we weren’t going to score, we just ran out of time before we did.”
PRECOCIOUS TALENT
The class of 2015 has had a solid showing on the field this season, with three freshmen already getting significant time and making an impact on the field.
Midfielder Hiroki Kobayashi was featured in Harvard’s starting lineup for both weekend’s matches, with Innocenzi and midfielder Tim Schmoll also getting several minutes.
In the match against the Minutemen, Schmoll recorded two shots, while Innocenzi drew two fouls in the box to give Harvard penalty-kick opportunities. In Sunday’s contest against Vermont, Innocenzi tallied a shot, and Kobayashi created opportunities with his dangerous services in both matches.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The latest road game for the Harvard men’s soccer team turned out to be a disappointing finish to a rather lackluster weekend.
On Friday night at Soliders Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, the Crimson (2-3) barely edged out UMass (1-6) in overtime, 1-0, before falling to Vermont (5-1) by the same score in Sunday afternoon’s away matchup.
Despite the plethora of offensive opportunities and well-constructed build-up plays in both games this weekend, Harvard lacked that final spark of ingenuity in front of the goal.
“Goals are hard to come by for us right now,” Crimson coach Carl Junot said. “It’s that final piece of quality that we are looking for.”
But in the eyes of junior forward Brian Rogers, the final piece in the Crimson offense may not be all that difficult to find.
“Like anything in sports, sometimes a bit of luck and a bit of momentum is needed to put you over the edge,” Rogers said. “I think that one of these next few games, we are going to have a real offensive explosion, in which a bunch of those shots do go in. From there you’ll see our confidence go up, and then we’ll hopefully be shooting at a better percentage.”
VERMONT 1, HARVARD 0
Playing in Burlington, Vt., on Sunday afternoon, the Harvard men’s soccer team was aggressive in its offensive third of the field. But as has been the case so far this season, the Crimson’s failure to capitalize on its scoring opportunities led to a second straight away defeat.
The Catamounts attained the lone score of the match late in the second half, thanks to a long throw-in by junior defender Sean Sweeney that found the head of senior Yannick Lewis.
With a little more than five minutes to play in the match, Lewis’ header made the difference in the otherwise evenly-contested game.
“That was a pretty frustrating game in that we lost,” Rogers said. “Vermont is a tough place to play. The field is sloppy, and it’s a pretty rowdy environment, but it could have gone either way.”
Despite a losing effort, the Crimson kept up with Vermont statistically for much of the game, but ran out of steam late in the second half. For the game, the Catamounts edged Harvard in shots, 10-8, and in corner kicks, 6-4.
“Overall it was a pretty evenly-matched game, and I think that they earned the win well with the throw-in,” Junot said.
HARVARD 1, UMASS 0
Although UMass made the home-side work hard for the victory, in the end, the Crimson escaped with a win after a game-winning penalty kick in overtime by junior co-captain Scott Prozeller, 1-0.
Playing under the lights for the second time this season at the Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium, Harvard began the game by dictating the pace of play and pressing deep into Minutemen territory.  By the 18th minute of play, the Crimson had mustered three shots on goal and two corner kicks, and looked poised to score at any moment.
At 22:36, with freshman Michael Innocenzi driving towards the goal, UMass conceded a penalty to the Crimson after rookie Michael Innocenzi was tripped up by a Minuteman defender just inside the penalty area. When junior Brian Rogers stepped up to take his first penalty kick of the season, Harvard seemed assured of its first goal. But Rogers kicked the ball wide right, keeping the game scoreless.
But despite the penalty miss, Harvard showed no signs of letting up offensively. At the end of the first half, the Crimson continually challenged the UMass backline and outshot the visitors, 6-0.
Throughout the second half, the Crimson continued to look confident and threatened the Minutemen on a regular basis, but getting a shot by the goalkeeper proved to be a difficult task. With the match still scoreless after regulation play, the game moved into overtime.
Two minutes into overtime with the Minutemen pressing into the Harvard penalty box, senior goalkeeper Austin Harms made a crucial save off a header to deny UMass of what could have been a game-winning goal.
Less than five minutes later, the Crimson secured a game-winning opportunity of its own after Innocenzi was once again cut down inside the box, giving the home-side a chance to score.
Stepping up to the penalty spot this time was Prozeller, who confidently buried the ball into the top-left corner of the net, granting Harvard the victory.
The Crimson pick up play again next weekend on the road against Stanford and Santa Clara.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend’s slate of games had the potential to provide the Harvard women’s soccer team with some much-needed momentum heading into the start of the Ivy League season after a 3-0 loss to Boston University on Wednesday.
Instead, the Crimson (3-4) suffered two gut-wrenching losses against nonconference opponents, dropping a home game, 5-4, against Hofstra (4-2) on Friday and falling 3-2 to University of Rhode Island (4-3-1) in a double-overtime loss on Sunday.
“It’s important for us to take a break,” co-captain Melanie Baskind said. “We need a mental restart as much as physical. I’m really looking forward to the Ivy League. We’re looking at Friday [against Penn] as starting fresh.”
UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND 3, HARVARD 2
Down by two 20:33 into the first half, Harvard faced the stark possibility of losing its third game in five days, this time at the hands of URI. The Crimson ultimately lost a heartbreaker to the Rams, but the team engineered its second comeback of the weekend, erasing the two-goal deficit and sending the game into two overtimes.
Baskind started the comeback five minutes after URI’s second goal, sending a pass into the box that freshman Erika Garcia knocked into the back of the net, cutting the Rhode Island lead to one.
“[Sophomore Elizabeth Weisman and I] kind of scored the goal together,” Garcia said. “Having both of us in the box helped.”
With 20 minutes left in regulation, freshman Lauren Urke sent a corner kick in front of the net which classmate Kate Makaroff tapped past the Rams goalkeeper to tie the score at two.
“I think [the reason we are so good at rebounding from a deficit] is the fact that the team doesn’t want to lose,” Garcia said. “Everyone’s in a fighting mode throughout the game. Everyone shows that, especially in a comeback.”
Despite Harvard’s second-half heroics, the Crimson fell short in the second overtime. In the 107th minute, URI’s Megan Rauscher sent a shot from 25 yards out past Crimson goaltender Bethany Kanten ending the game in the Rams’ favor.
HOFSTRA 5, HARVARD 4
Two days earlier, the Crimson fell to Hofstra 5-4 at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium in a game that featured offensive fireworks and defensive miscues from both teams.
“I can’t remember the last time I’ve been in a five-goal game,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “There were eight goals in the second half. That’s insane. That’s a crazy game.”
The Crimson got on the board 16:15 in with a chip shot from freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby, her first Harvard goal. With the Pride controlling possession for most of the half, Crimson junior Alexandra Conigliaro broke downfield and passed the ball to Casscells-Hamby who lobbed it over a rushing Hofstra keeper.
Hofstra evened the score at 1-1 with senior Laura Greene heading in a corner kick less than three minutes into the second half.  Eight minutes later, Harvard moved the ball up the left side and finished with a cross pass from Baskind to Conigliaro, who punched the ball in the back of the net and helped the Crimson retake the lead.
From that point on, the Pride capitalized on several breakdowns in the Harvard defense to string together four straight goals, setting the score at 5-2 lead with 18:32 left in the contest. Greene dealt the first blow with her second goal of the game, an unassisted effort at 55:54. Hofstra took a 3-2 lead when senior Courtney Breen found the net on a corner kick. Goals from Brittany Butts at 60:57 and another from Breen at 71:28 gave the Pride a three-goal advantage.
“In soccer, scores generally don’t go up that high and when they do, there’s something breaking down for both teams,” rookie Mai Le said. “It was just really unusual how the play was switching back and forth so fast.”
With 14:13 left, freshman Le breathed life into the Crimson with a cross to fellow first-year Garcia, who headed the ball past the goalie and cut Harvard’s deficit to two goals. Over 13 minutes later, Casscells-Hamby sent a laser into the top right corner of the net to tally her second goal of the game, accounting for the 5-4 final score.
“I’m really pleased with what they gave at the end of the game,” Leone said. “It shows a lot of promise and resilience of this team, and if we’re going to be where we want to be, we need to be resilient.”
After enduring an exhausting preseason that included three games in five days, Harvard looks to rebound against last year’s Ancient Eight champion University of Pennsylvania on Friday night. For both squads, Friday’s game marks the start of the Ivy League season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (2-4, 0-1 Ivy) rallied and tied the game Sunday at three, but a late Quinnipiac goal with five seconds remaining ended the comeback and left the Crimson with a winless weekend.
Harvard dropped its first conference game of the year on Saturday, losing to Yale 5-1 at Johnson Field in New Haven, Conn., before the close loss to the Bobcats at Hamden, Conn., the next day.
“I felt like against Yale we tried to stick together as a whole team and keep pressuring the ball, and they just got the better of us in that game,” sophomore Rachael Rosenfeld said. “We were having trouble in the midfield, and they made us break apart, and they got some goals on us.”
Quick starts by the home teams ended up costing the Crimson in both games. In Saturday’s contest, the Bulldogs (2-3, 0-1) scored three first-half goals and maintained the lead throughout en route to a 5-1 victory, while Quinnipiac (5-2, 0-0 Northeast-10) took a 2-0 lead in the first half that Harvard failed to overturn.
“I think something we learned from the UMass game last weekend is that we need to start stronger in the first half,” co-captain Georgia McGillivray said. “We really need to come out and own the ball and play our game and be [at] 100 percent right from the opening whistle.”
QUINNIPIAC 4, HARVARD 3
Sophomore Kyleigh Keating scored her second goal of the game to give the Crimson the tie but Bobcat sophomore Amanda Danziger put in a goal with five seconds remaining, leaving Harvard shocked and defeated.
Danziger was able to slip past the Crimson defense off a pass from Quinnipiac senior Maria Malonski. Danziger received the pass and slipped a shot past Tassopoulos, sealing the win for the Bobcats.
Quinnipiac broke the standstill early, as senior Kimberly Cunniff scored off a corner a little over four and a half minutes into the game.
There was a significant shot discrepancy; the Bobcats had eight shots compared to the Harvard’s two 15 minutes into the contest, but Harvard goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos stepped up after having a tough game Saturday to keep the game close.
Quinnipiac senior Megan McCreedy scored off a corner to make the score 2-0 but the Crimson would not give in.
Harvard’s Keating and freshman Noel Painter scored one goal each in a span of 30 seconds to tie the game at two with less than four minutes in the first period.
“We started really connecting well in the midfield and bringing the ball up and connecting with the forwards,” Rosenfeld said. “We were pressuring for a goal a lot more and having an attack [mode] during those minutes when we scored goals back-to-back. That was very exciting.”
In the second half, Bobcat sophomore Jess Rusin scored off a breakaway to give Quinnipiac another lead, but Keating tied the game with eight and a half minutes remaining.
Harvard had a couple of chances before the buzzer but couldn’t recover from Danziger’s late tally.
“[Sunday’s] game was a complete 180,” Rosenfeld said. “We had great defense, and we came back from behind and tied the game. It was just unlucky with the last goal they got, so that was really upsetting.”
YALE 5, HARVARD 1
The Bulldogs charged out of the gates, scoring three unanswered goals in the first half. Yale continued its dominance throughout the contest, maintaining the lead thanks to a 36-7 shot advantage.
“We had a tough start to the game,” McGillivray said. “I think the main thing is that Yale plays a similar style to us, and they were just one step ahead of us in a lot of things, especially in the first half. They were getting to the ball first, and they were just one second quicker than us.”
The Bulldogs got on the scoreboard when sophomore Erica Borgo batted in a goal 12 minutes into the contest.
Then Yale sophomore Emily Schuckert broke the game open with two goals in the span of three minutes. The Bulldogs led 3-0 with 15 minutes remaining in the half.
The Crimson looked to regroup heading into the second half, but Yale’s Borgo gave a good pass to junior Maddy Sharp, who buried the shot from the near post five minutes into the second half.
The Bulldogs continued to maintain control of the ball while Tassopoulos made a couple of saves to keep Yale off the board, but she was unable to stop a shot by Yale senior Mia Rosati, setting the score at 5-0 and leading the Crimson to insert sophomore Jenn Hatfield in front of the net.
Hatfield came in and kept Yale off the board with eight saves, and Harvard co-captain Carly Dickson scored a goal off a corner for the final score of the game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
WORCESTER, Mass.—For the first five minutes of the game, it felt like it was all Holy Cross. For the rest of the first quarter, Harvard held all the momentum and looked to be running away with the game. But with 17 points in the second quarter, the Crusaders controlled the afternoon from then on.
Holy Cross hardly put up better numbers than the Crimson on Saturday—first downs, rushing yards, and completions were almost identical between the two teams. The Crusaders won because of a few big plays, both on offense and defense.
It started just a few minutes into the game. Harvard stopped Holy Cross in its first drive, forcing a punt. But the Crimson botched the return, and the Crusaders recovered deep in the red zone.
At the start of the second quarter, just 18 seconds after a Harvard touchdown, Holy Cross quarterback Ryan Taggart threw a 68-yard pass for the score. A lapse in the secondary coverage left receiver Josh Hauser wide open to take it to the house and pull the Crusaders within four.
Minutes later, on fourth-and-15, Harvard tried a fake punt, snapping it to junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk, who made a run to his right. He fell about a yard short, leaving Holy Cross with good field position, and the Crusaders took their second lead of the day later in the drive.
And in the fourth quarter, down by nine, Harvard was in the red zone, poised to make it a two-point game. But senior quarterback Collier Winters underthrew a pass to senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch on the outside, and the Crusaders picked it and took it 97 yards for the touchdown.
“The punt, the interception, and the busted coverage—we made three [mistakes],” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “That’s 21 points, I believe. Beyond that, after the first quarter, we let our defense stay on the field too long.”
Harvard would have its chances at a comeback later in the game, but its errors proved too costly to overcome.
SILVER LINING
Murphy’s biggest concern going into the game, he said, was the team’s offensive line.
“When you’ve lost all the people we’ve lost, the margins are razor thin,” Murphy said before the game last week. “We’re travelling three freshmen on the offensive line. I don’t know if we’ve ever travelled one freshman before.”
In the offensive line’s first shot at game-day action, it had an up-and-down day. Winters was sacked three times, and blitzes forced him into bad passes on other occasions.
But, at other points during the day, the line held steady. On both of Winters’ touchdown passes, he had plenty of time to move around and find an open receiver. The line performed consistently throughout the day—it just so happened that when Winters was pressured, the errors proved especially costly.
“From my vantage point, you throw the ball 40-something times, it’s probably too many, but I thought [the offensive line] played overall well,” Murphy said. “There were no glaring mistakes, and they hung in there.”
Of the three freshman that travelled, only Will Whitman started, making his debut at right tackle for the Crimson. The 260-pound rookie was involved in the action all day, and he cleared the path for Winters’ scramble for a touchdown in the first quarter to give Harvard the early lead.
COUNTING TO FOUR
Early in the game, there were a number of unexpected fourth-down attempts from both teams. But late in the game, after both squads looked eager to take the fourth-down risk, the two suddenly seemed unwilling to go for it.
It started with the unsuccessful fake punt from Harvard, a clear turning point in the contest.
Holy Cross’ multiple—and questionable—fourth-down tries seemed driven by a lack of confidence in its place kicker. In the middle of the third quarter, the Crusaders opted to go for it on fourth-and-four rather than attempt a 43-yard field goal. Senior Matthew Hanson broke up the pass to force a turnover on downs.
The attitude towards the kicker became apparent again in the fourth quarter. Once again in field goal range—the successful kick would have put Holy Cross up by 11 with just minutes left in the game—the Crusaders again went for the chance on fourth. It paid off, and Taggart completed a pass to a wide-open receiver for the first down.
“Taggart was doing a really good job getting the ball out quick, and they were starting to pick up our blitz,” captain Alex Gedeon said.
But the teams lost their taste for fourth-down chances late in the game. With about four minutes to go, the Crimson elected to punt rather than go for it on fourth-and-10.
A few minutes later, with the Crimson out of timeouts, the Crusaders punted on fourth-and-short, opting not to try for a first down that would have ended the game.
The last fourth-down try was a desperation pass from Winters that Holy Cross intercepted to end the game.
“I thought he played extremely well at times and kept us in the game,” Murphy said. “We just got to do more to help him.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In preseason, boundless optimism takes full expression. As the great sportswriter Jim Murray once said about baseball’s spring training, “It’s March. Everybody wins the pennant. Every pitcher is Cy Young. Every batter is Ty Cobb.”
And the same is certainly applicable to football. Concerns are brushed aside and discounted, and confidence bubbles to the surface. Talking to the players and Tim Murphy over the past few weeks, enthusiasm reigned. One player told me that Collier Winters was surprising even the secondary coaches with his accuracy.  Murphy expressed deep confidence in a Collin Zych-less secondary and thought that Treavor Scales, more so than his Ivy League MVP predecessor, could pull off those highlight-reel runs. And of course, no one would be able to stop Josue Ortiz.
But in the first game, always in that first game, optimism meets and is tempered by its cold enemy reality. The same was true for the Harvard Crimson Saturday afternoon in a tough 30-22 loss.
Winters, while accurate for parts of the game, threw two picks, and completed just over 50 percent of his passes in the final three quarters. The secondary made some serious gaffes, and a blown coverage allowed for a 68-yard touchdown. Scales’ longest run was just nine yards, and Ortiz only recorded two tackles.
Perhaps Murphy summed it up best. When asked about the positive takeaways from the contest, he quipped, “It wasn’t a league game.”
But it’s not fair to dismiss the contest entirely: there were some mitigating factors. Ortiz was double-teamed all game long and dealt with some pretty serious holding (and even so, he made one of those how-did-he-just-do-that tackles in the fourth quarter when he essentially outran the Holy Cross running back). The Crusaders blitzed like crazy, making the run less of an option and taking Scales out of the picture. That forced Harvard to go to the air 41 times.
And of course—most importantly—it was Harvard’s first game.
In my book, there are two broad categories of losses. The first: the other team was better—a lot better. Not a whole lot you can do about those.
The second: the teams were equally matched, maybe we were even a little better, but we didn’t execute. And the other team played well too, I guess.
Luckily for the Crimson, Saturday’s loss falls into the second category, thanks in large part to the rust that comes with the first game.  If two plays had turned out differently—if Harvard hadn’t dropped a punt and Winters hadn’t thrown that pick-six—the scoreboard at the end of the game just as well might have read, “Harvard 24, Holy Cross 20.”
So for that reason, Harvard football fans can take a sigh of relief. Their team has the talent to keep up with anyone. I think that’s clear. Furthermore, one of the biggest question marks coming into the season—the offensive line—played quite well and gave Winters ample time in the pocket.
But regardless of the outcome, Harvard has its work cut out over the next four days, when the Brown Bears roll up to Harvard Stadium and the real season begins.
Because the Crimson, some of the time, just looked sloppy. Too many false starts from that young offensive line. Too many missed tackles by the defense, in addition to that blown coverage. A dropped punt. Harvard players bumping into each other. And not enough pressure on that Holy Cross quarterback. Overall, after a stellar first 16 minutes for the Crimson, Holy Cross outscored Harvard, 27-8.
Mind you, this was against a Crusaders team that had already played twice this season. It had a chance to work out some kinks and was playing at full-throttle yesterday.
Now, it’s Harvard’s turn to emulate that.
Leading up to Friday’s game, those punt returners will be practicing frequently, and you can bet they’ll be holding onto that ball pretty damn tightly. Receivers will be working on their routes to give Winters much better looks. The secondary will focus on eliminating breakdowns and the whole defense on improving its tackling.
Because now, the illusions that come with preseason are gone. In its place lies Saturday’s performance, and the areas that need improvement are clear.
But as Murphy said, the team cannot afford a few weeks to get into top shape. Harvard needs to do so with blazing alacrity.
Brown and the rest of the Ivies are stacked this season, overflowing with talent, especially at the quarterback position. The Crimson will face three first-team All-Ivy quarterbacks this season, including one in Brown’s Kyle Newhall-Caballero next week. If Harvard doesn’t sync by Friday, Brown will take advantage.
If the Crimson’s vaunted secondary doesn’t play to its potential, Newhall-Caballero will look like a fat kid in a candy shop.
And going 0-1 in the Ivies before facing either Penn or Yale would make attaining the Ivy League crown much, much tougher.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson kicked off its fall season this weekend by hosting the Harvard Fall Classic at the newly resurfaced courts of the Beren Tennis Center.
In the individual tournament, Harvard players fared well, with junior co-captain Kristin Norton highlighting the weekend with victories in the most competitive singles and doubles brackets.
Players from a number of East Coast schools participated, including Middlebury, Long Island University, University of Massachusetts, Temple, and Boston University.
The dynamic of the individual fall tournament season is unique from the team competitions of the spring, since fall competition often features teammates against each other in big matches.  This weekend’s tournament was no different.
The Crimson women dominated flight A, with all three Harvard players in the draw—juniors Norton, Camille Jania, and co-captain Hideko Tachibana—reaching the semifinals. Jania and Tachibana faced one another in the semis, and Jania ultimately prevailed in a hard-fought three-set match, 7-6(5), 2-6, 10-6, booking her place in the finals with Norton.
But that’s as far as Jania would go. After Norton took the first set in demanding fashion, she was off to the races in the second set, wasting no time in breaking her teammate’s serve twice to take a 3-0 lead. Norton earned a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 win to take the title.
“It was weird [playing Jania], but it was a lot of fun,” Norton said. “I have so much respect for Camille as a competitor, so it was great.”
Unlike many of the other matches of the tournament, the final was very subdued.
There were very few spectators watching Norton’s and Jania’s match, and the normally loud and energetic Norton was hushed.
Jania, who in previous matches was consistent with her groundstrokes, was taking more risks with her shots and was making a much high number of unforced errors in the final match.
In the end, Norton’s well-hit shots proved to be too much for Jania and the rest of her opponents all weekend. But not all of her matches came easily.
In Norton’s first round, she played a tough Boston University opponent, and after being down a set point at 5-6 in the first set, Norton’s opponent committed an unforced error, and the Crimson junior managed to break to even the set at 6-6.
“It was really close … she was a really tricky player,” Norton said. “I was just excited I was able to pull [the match] out.”
In the tiebreak, Norton was down a mini-break at 2-4, but was able to shift the momentum with well-placed shots and smart play to ultimately take the set en route to a straight-set win.
Norton’s path to the finals was considerably eased when she received a walkover in the semifinals after her Boston University opponent was unable to play due to injury.
In the flight B, Hannah Morril and Kelly Whelan both lost in the second round of the tournament.
Harvard’s Samantha Gridley, the top seed of flight C, lost her semifinal match in three sets, 6-2, 6-7(2), 10-6, to Middlebury’s Lok-Sze Leung.  And Gridley’s teammate in the same flight, Alex Lehman, also lost a tight three-set match in the semis, falling to University of Massachusetts player, Chanel Glasper, 6-2, 3-6, 10-5.
In the flight A doubles draw, the Crimson headlined again, with the team’s top pair of Norton and Tachibana taking the doubles title in comfortable fashion, winning 8-3 against Yuliana Motyl and Chantal Swiszcz of UMass.
In the Flight B doubles bracket, Harvard teams of Jania and Lehman, as well as Gridley and Li, both lost 8-3 in the semifinal round.
Overall, Crimson coach Traci Green was satisfied with her team’s performance this weekend.
“I saw a lot of poise out there,” Green said. “We have some improvements all around … but over all we had a good showing against some tough opponents … We are ready to move on from here.”
The duo of Tachibana and Norton was invited to compete in an All-American doubles tournament in California in early October, and the two are hoping to take their momentum from this weekend to the West Coast.
“[It was] a good warm-up tournament, so we really wanted to win the whole thing,” Norton said. “We had a couple tough matches, but we were able to pull it out.”
Besides the All-American tournament for Norton and Tachibana during the first week of October, the rest of the team will be in action again on Oct. 8, at the Billie Jean King Invitational in Flushing Meadows, N.Y.

The scene is familiar to many—chairs scattered, cups strewn over surfaces, students huddled around a lone TF, perhaps trying to debug a piece of rogue code or attempting to solve a complicated differential equation. To some, this is the scene of a battlefield, where one's hopes of getting a good night's sleep quickly vanquish. To others, however, there are only two questions—where the hell did all the food go, and who is to blame for the disappearance of the beloved ranger cookies?
The main culprits are the following p-set-heavy, ubiquitous courses: CS50, Physics 11, 15, and 16, and Math 23, which all hold office hours in the evenings in House dining halls across campus.
Leverett should be avoided on Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights, when hordes of CS50, Physics 15, and Physics 16 students flood the dining hall. Lowell residents should approach Wednesday and Thursday nights with caution, and Pfoho should be wary of Mondays. Quincy and Cabot residents should avoid Sunday and Monday nights as Math 23 p-sets are due on Tuesdays.
All that said, the courses have been making efforts to reduce the amount of food eaten from brain break tables. CS50 has coordinated with House dining halls to provide extra food on office hour nights. Despite these efforts, however, all the Brain Break food (including non course-designated foods) still seems to be close to gone by the end of the night.
"Because CS50 is holding office hours in dining halls, there is an arrangement that's been made and dining halls are supposed to have more food. Up until now it's just been cookies," said Sara B. Towne '12, a current CS50 student. "The food's usually gone by the end of the night, though, as well as the regular brain break food."
One would think that huge classes like Ec10 and LS1a would fill up dining halls in an instant. However, the TFs of those classes placed their office hours in non food-bearing spaces and thus gather in locations like Lamont and the Science Center instead. So the next time there are no snacks left when you get to brain break, you’ll know to give your roommate a big hug when they return from the grueling study session. That, or you'll know who to blame.
