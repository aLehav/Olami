Packed into a darkened room in John Harvard’s Brewery sat two opposing households: the Montagues and the Capulets. Their ancient grudge, having lain dormant for a whole year, is about to break to new mutiny in the yearly celebration of Shakespeare’s birthday. The Actors’ Shakespeare Project, the Orfeo Group, the American Repertory Theater, the Central Square Theatre, the Cambridge Arts Council, multiple other Cambridge-based drama groups, and the Harvard Square Business Association have joined together for the last three years to commemorate the birth of the prolific English playwright. Thus, on April 17 at 3 pm in the afternoon, around 60 Shakespeare fanatics turned the crowded bar of John Harvard into 17th century Verona, as they performed a group rendition of the balcony scene from “Romeo and Juliet”. Our Roving Reporter investigates.
Trent Mills, Member of the Actors’ Shakespeare Project
RR: Would you describe yourself as a Shakespeare fanatic?
TM: I mean, I don’t think I would be here if I wasn’t.
RR: You have valiantly chosen to perform as a Juliet for the occasion.
TM: I love playing girls.
RR: You do? Wow, I wasn’t really asking for an insight into your personal life, but thanks.
TM: No, I just had to decide at the door and on the spur of the moment decided Juliet.
RR: Okay. So what would you say your favorite Shakespeare play is?
TM: Um, if I had to say any it would probably be “A Winter’s Tale.”
Elderly man, who did not wish to be named
RR: How do you feel about Shakespeare?
EM: Well...I feel pretty good.
RR: No, I mean are you a fan?
EM: I’ve seen a couple of plays, they’re pretty good.
RR: So, to sum up, Shakespeare is ‘pretty good.’
EM: Urgh, yeah. He’s done a lot for our society.
RR: I agree. Okay, Montague or Capulet?
EM: Excuse me?
RR: Montague or Capulet? Which side are you going to take?
EM: ...Are you swearing at me?
Doug Lockwood, Member of the Actors’ Shakespeare Project
RR: Huge Shakespeare fan?
DL: I think that’s true.
RR: Okay, so, favorite play?
DL: I like the dark comedies.
RR: Always satisfying. Although I am most definitely a tragedy fan myself.
DL: You like the drama?
RR: Oh, I am all about the drama. Favorite line from a play? I am a fan of “This above all: To thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man.”
DL: “Hamlet.” Very nice. I’m pretty fond of Edgar’s last line of “King Lear”, ‘Speak what we feel not what we ought to play’.
RR: So is that your favorite part to play?
DL: It would be Edgar, yes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Kuumba is very much a family, and sometimes after you graduate it’s hard to feel a part of that family,” says President Andrea M. Tyler ’10, “but one of the main goals that we really want to see happening is that everyone understands that family doesn’t end after we go home.” With the establishment of an alumni board, this preservation of history and culture will be possible for the Kuumba Singers. Created in the year of Kuumba’s 40th anniversary, the alumni board, known to members as “Rafiki Wa Kuumba,” (“Friends of Kuumba” in Swahili) is a move to form a community of black students and alumni that will preserve the institutional memory of the organization and foster communication with graduates.
The Kuumba Singers was founded in 1970 by Dennis W. Wiley ’72 and Fred A. Lucas ’72 at a time when racial hostility in Boston was rampant. Originally created as a safe space for black students on the Harvard campus and in the greater Boston area, the choir’s focus more recently has shifted towards celebrating black culture. Vice President Kaydene K. Grinnell ’10 says, “Our goal is to celebrate black creativity and spirituality, and that is done through music, dance, song, and spoken word.”
Kuumba intends to expand this focus by developing annual town hall meetings, the first of which took place last weekend as part of Kuumba’s 40th anniversary celebrations. After the current undergraduate executive board discussed their accomplishments for the year as well as problems they had encountered, the forum gave alumni an opportunity to communicate their visions and goals for the organization.
“The town hall meeting was amazing in the sense that it displayed the organization of the executive board, the passion of the students of Kuumba, the connectedness which is inter-generational now,” says returning alumni Dennis J. Henderson ’79. “They’re very concerned about connecting the past to the present and to the future so they have a vision for keeping Kuumba going and expanding it. I believe that it is also the foundation for greater stability in the future.”
Because Kuumba emphasizes exploring the whole range of “black creativity and spirituality,” which it claims is part of its mission, it also organizes other events throughout the year, such as the Black Arts Festival. The Festival is comprised of different elements, ranging from a visual arts gallery to a performing arts showcase that features spoken word, song, dance, and a photo gallery. The Festival gives Kuumba members and the surrounding community an opportunity to explore facets of black culture that would otherwise be unavailable in a singularly choral experience.
These events and the goals of Kuumba seek to enlighten black students about their rich history. “It’s really about education for us, learning about the whole African diasporic experience,” Tyler says. “So it’s not particularly a Black American culture, it’s also the West Indian cultures, and the first generation African culture. It’s about us educating ourselves about the full range of the black experience.”
Ultimately, Kuumba is unified by its ambition to explore black culture and its commitment to ensuring that undergraduates on campus view the choir as a safe space for black students. Members hope these goals will remain unchanged.
“The one thing you hear overwhelmingly year after year from the alums that come back [is that] they all say that although things have changed, Kuumba remains the same,” says Sheldon K. X. Reid ’96. “So we feel like we’re keeping true to the intent and the purpose of the mission and goals of the people that came before us, which is our goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Get Him To the Greek,” opening June 4, Jonah Hill (“Superbad”) plays the awkward, music-loving Aaron Green, an employee of a major recording company. When his boss sends him to meet rebellious, free-wheeling rockstar-turned-junkie Aldous Snow (Russel Brand) Aaron is nowhere near prepared for the wild hijinks that ensue. He has 72 hours to get Snow from his penthouse in London to the Greek Theater in L.A., but Snow is not going quietly.
Snow has appeared on the silver screen before, in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” where Brand played the hippie pop-singer who steals away the protagonist’s dream girl. However, despite marked similarities, the happy, free-wheeling Aldous Snow from “Sarah Marshall” is nowhere near as wild or self-destructive as the character in “Greek.”
“‘Forgetting Sarah Marshall’ was a laugh because it was all about restraint,” said Brand. “For a supporting role I had to be kind of measured and gentle; the key thing for me was making a sympathetic villain, a character [whose] function was to antagonize the protagonist, to fuck him off because I’ve got his bird. But in this film the character’s back on drugs, the arc is built around his conduct and his behavior and it’s sort of a double-act with Jonah. I had a lot more room to explore that darkness and to show off.”
Although Brand is reprising his role, Hill, who also had a supporting role in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” has embraced the chance to change roles. Instead of resurrecting his character from “Sarah Marshall”—a silly, slightly manic waiter—Hill went back to the drawing board for the mild-mannered Aaron Green.
“My character in ‘Sarah Marshall’ wouldn’t have been interesting to see throughout a whole movie,” Hill explained, “He was sort of... one-dimensional. He was more the funny, weird stalker-ish guy. Aaron’s probably the most together character I’ve ever played in a film... I just felt like Matthew the waiter is a weird character, but he’s not someone you might want to sit through a whole film [with], you might not buy it.”
Off screen, both men are very involved in comedy and performance of all kinds. Hill began his career performing in one-act plays in New York City, and now alternates between acting, writing, and producing. Between acting gigs, he has recently helped to write and produce “Brüno” for Sacha Baron Cohen, and soon will be writing and producing the film adaptation of “21 Jump Street.”
“If this wasn’t my job I would be doing this anyways for free,” he said.  “My advice to anyone is sit down and write, get some friends, borrow a camera, borrow whatever and don’t make it fancy, just trial and error. Just make little films. That’s what I’d be doing in my apartment if I wasn’t doing this. Just find what you love and work your ass off at it.”
Brand is also involved in comedy, performing stand-up sketches and writing books. Although he is decidedly British, Brand has found a niche in American pop culture.
“I’ve been observing you Americans on a Petri dish... There are some distinctions but I think that both countries are interested in manners and protocol. You know British people are thought of as being incredibly polite and it’s true. I suppose that you don’t have such a vindictive media. I think that there is social mobility, a spirit where achieving is a positive thing.”
“But then again,” he added, “you have no football here. Except that thing where you touch it with your hands and call it football. I’m still mad about that.”
Hill’s vision of comedy stems from  myriad sources, a strange and varied list including everything from Martin Scorcese to “The Simpsons.” However, his comedic sensibilities inevitably come back to Woody Allen.
“Woody Allen... is pretty much the premier comedic filmmaker of all time,” he said, “I think that he achieved so much emotion and so much reality to the relationships and so much beauty in these films while still being hilariously funny and making complete films.”
Both men have fairly busy schedules ahead of them. Hill is currently working on “Moneyball,” a film adaptation of the book of the same name, as well as awaiting the release of his film “Cyrus.” Brand, on the other hand, is heading into production for the remake of Dudley Moore comedy, “Arthur.”
“‘Arthur’’s going to be out next year and it’s going to be a fantastic film,” he said. “I’m going to be nude a lot.”

“This shit’s been crazy. You got people falling out of caskets and hanging off of the roof,” says Norman (Tracy Morgan) in “Death at a Funeral,” and, in short, this quotation can be neatly applied to the entirety of the film.
Produced a mere three years after the release of the 2007 British independent film of the same name, the movie is a case study of the absurd—it settles into a vein of ridiculous circumstances early on, and this proves to be the defining attribute of the film, from the opening scene to the end credits.
The movie opens with the death of Aaron’s (Chris Rock) father, and a eulogy service which, under normal circumstances, would be a rather somber and brief affair. Events, however, are turned on their ear from the very beginning of the film. Initially, the undertaker confuses Aaron’s father for another and gives the family the wrong body.
As the eulogy service continues at a snail’s pace—which is no surprise given that it is constantly interrupted with episodes of absolute mayhem—Oscar (James Marsden) accidentally takes a hallucinogenic drug instead of a Vallium, and a gay midget, Frank (Peter Dinklage), threatens the family of the deceased with pictures of Aaron’s father and himself performing sexual acts.
Danny Glover’s character, Uncle Russell, exclaims at one point in the film, “I’m family, goddammit,” amidst a string of other more choice words. As “Death at a Funeral” continues, it becomes clear that the film functions more as a family reunion of extremely divergent personalities than as anything else, and it is in this arena that the movie shines.
The characters are colorful and their personalities are strong. Moreover, the actors who play them do a remarkable job of bringing out these often obnoxious personas. With a cast comprised of such seasoned comedic actors as Chris Rock, Martin Lawrence, Luke Wilson, and Danny Glover, it’s clear that the film does not lack for acting talent.
Where the movie does falls short, however, is in its often confusing and poorly-written script. Among the antics, the movie seems to lose its focus on the reason why the family is gathered in the first place—a funeral. Instead, the actors get lost in the numerous subplots which, though funny, often seem excessively tangential. A gay midget, a high boyfriend, a stubborn ex, and a financially irresponsible brother dominate the plot throughout, and while in some ways the circuitous nature of the film is intentional, one can’t help but picture the actors as the proverbial “chickens with their heads cut off” as they run from place to place in the film with overarching motivation.
The movie also lacks creativity at almost every turn. Many of the movie’s scenes are very close in content and construction to the British version, and the score is unoriginal and bland.
However, despite these shortcomings and the lack of originality in the film’s premise and plot, the movie can be genuinely funny at parts. Especially good are the one-liners placed throughout the film which add a certain comedic charm.
For example. when tying up Frank after he is accidentally drugged and knocked unconscious, Aaron remarks, “What do I look like, a serial killer? I don’t carry rope and duct tape around with me.” While in another particularly memorable scene, Jeff, a pharmacy student played by Columbus Short (“Stomp The Yard”), is asked about the origins of his hallucinogenic pills and replies, “I whipped a batch up for a friend,” a response which prompts Aaron to quip, “What friend, Amy Winehouse?”
Though unoriginal in almost every regard, “Death at a Funeral” brings funny, energetic characters to the screen and possesses some truly genuine laughs.
The movie is not exceptional, but it is able to find humor in its absolute absurdity. While by no means, as Michelle (Regina Hall) says, is this “the best eulogy anyone’s ever heard,” the film makes for an enjoyable, if mediocre, 90 minutes with a handful of outrageous and memorable scenes.

“El secreto de sus ojos”  (“The Secret in Their Eyes”) is meant to explore the nature of violence, to question the human passion for the destructive, to honor sacrifice in the name of friendship, and to consider the potential for a love that either cuts across socioeconomic class or “freezes in time.” The film does, in one way or another, include all of these motifs, but it presents them in a way that is so cliché and fragmented that their meaning, for the most part, is lost. The themes are not properly developed, in part because there are so many of them, and in part because they are represented in a way that is hopelessly superficial and melodramatic, not to mention pretentious.
“The Secret in Their Eyes,” is the fourth feature-length film by Argentinean director Juan José Campanella. Based on Eduardo Sacheri’s novel “La pregunta de sus ojos” (“The Question in Their Eyes”), the film flits back and forth between 1974 and the present day, as it tells the story of Argentinean formal federal justice agent, Benjamín Espósito  (Ricardo Darín) who is haunted by a 25-year old unsolved crime, as well as the lost opportunities in his love life. Benjamín’s quest for closure is put to the test when he decides to write a novel about the rape and murder case that has been on his mind, leading him to revisit his past in every sense of the word.
The film's cookie-cutter plot set-up may lead one to ask “Will there be redemption for the villains?” and “Will the desperate lovers be reunited once more?” But these questions are not raised or answered in a way that is logical, credible, or intriguing. The scenes drag on, as the storyline needlessly complicates itself further and further. It does not take long for the incessant action to turn into monotony. Viewers are presented with painfully gory scenes set to painfully sentimental music, for painfully long periods of time.  But those scenes make no gesture at self-awareness; instead, the camera takes a step back and gives viewers a lot of time to contemplate the violence, making the scenes tedious, slow, and overwrought.
Many of the scenes look bland, giving the impression that those same shots have already been done before in other films, only better. The style of the film is somewhat reminiscent of episodes of “Law and Order” in the way the camera films investigators walking around a city talking about crime. And indeed, Campanella directed several episodes of the show. Imitating the visual style of Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar, Campanella frames some shots with dramatic red curtains and varies shots between warm and cold colors, but he does not use the effect consistently. Campanella shows the violent, bloody corpse in long takes set to emotional music in a way that Martin Scorcese had been doing since “Gangs of New York,” brought to a real level of expertise in “Shutter Island.” In these movies Scorcese achieves a conceptual depth that Campanella only aspires to. He does not take all of these influences to create an original, interesting whole. Rather, each influence stands on its own, as a separate component.
At any rate, what the film lacks is inventiveness, as it continuously resorts to clichés. In a recurring image, Campanella shows a woman’s hand on the side of a window of a moving train and, of course, a tear in her eyes as she tries to hold onto her lover’s hand through the glass. The atmosphere is so sappy that one might find oneself wishing she could just fall into the tracks.
The director attempts to imbue the movie with mysteries about love, crime, and human nature, and fails utterly. The real mystery is how this movie ended up snatching any accolades at all, let alone the Oscar for Best Foreign Film earlier this year, and the Goya Prize last year—some of the highest in the industry.

“Exit Through the Gift Shop” is a nightmare of a film, but not in the way one might expect. Preconceptions of an aesthetically-pleasing, Banksy-produced documentation of Street Art tumble as quickly as one artist’s bucket of paint in the opening credits.
The documentary is a high-speed chase through the moon-lit streets of Los Angeles, guided by the amateur camerawork of the eccentric frenchman, Thierry Guetta. If you thought the highlight of this adrenalin-fuelled documentary would be the prolific and anonymous Banksy, you will be sadly mistaken. The maverick Guetta—otherwise known as Mr. Brainwash—takes center stage, plunging the film into a turbulent, artistic nightmare.
The film begins as a simple appraisal of street art, via the shaky lens of the camera-obsessed Guetta. He first trawls the streets of Paris, and then L.A., becoming the accomplice of numerous street artists. Guetta films almost every second of their work—the documentary is intense and fast-paced, twisting around every corner to capture a different artist at work: Shepard Fairey, Andre, Zeus, and Space Invader, to name a few.
Every moment mimics the exhilaration of the medium itself, as artists are chased off by the police midway through a piece. Guetta then achieves the inconceivable: he meets and becomes the aide of the elusive Banksy. Hooded and voice-dubbed, Guetta films Banksy in his workshop, cutting stencils and implementing his famous “Murdered Phonebox” piece in Central London. The footage is almost breath-taking, capturing in a few moments the comedy and tenacity of the street art phenomenon.
Street art is an underground movement which emerged in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of artists such as Blek le Rat, Basquiat, and the British anarcho-punk band Crass. In a youthful reclamation of the street, artists paint political messages and manifestos in an attempt to subvert both the popularized mass-consumption of art and its elitist status.
However street art is transient, technically ‘vandalism,’ and pieces are often removed mere hours after their creation. Its documentation is therefore of high value, as captured on film these images often outlast the pieces themselves.
But the film, although an important artifact of this transient genre, is also a critique of street art. “Exit Through the Gift Shop” takes a tragic plunge when, after eight years of gathering footage, Guetta abdicates the camera and begins to create his own street art. Re-naming himself Mr. Brainwash (MBW), Guetta begins to organize his own exhibition of street art, “Life is Beautiful,” despite his relative anonymity.
Renting a former Hollywood studio and filling it with over 200 paintings, sculptures and prints, and an installation of 25,000 books, the exhibition is of comically immense scale. But the media-hype and careful manipulation of marketing strategies ensures Guetta’s circus is a ground-breaking success.
The irony in this exhibitionist charade, despite the 4,000 people pouring through the doors on the first day alone, is the lack of ground-breaking inspiration in any of MBW’s work. His pieces are unoriginal. They resemble and imitate all of the work he has spent hours filming and abetting. Or, as Banksy himself states in the film, Guetta “repeated things until they became meaningless,” but through a careful marketing strategy he was able to package the street-art aesthetic, and to sell it. Essentially, Guetta cheated street art; he seized the art form, in the midst of its popularity, and turned it into a product of mass consumption.
“Exit Through the Gift Shop” is, much like its maker, both exhilarating and infuriating. It is brilliant, eccentric, and wild. The viewer gets precious glimpses into the creative process of Banksy himself as he hurriedly fixes, by flashlight, one of his infamous mouse stencils on a grimy Los Angeles street. But it is also highly provocative, as Banksy seizes this opportunity to critique our own defacement of this urban art form.
The documentary tells the real truth of Mr. Brainwash’s success: a success due not to creativity, but to careful marketing. The charisma of street art is its ideology, its opposition to the establishment of gallery art. It is art we all can appreciate and we all can contribute to.
However the documentary seeks to relay an important message: with the persistent desire to consume street art, to purchase pieces and support exhibitions, we are vandalising the walls upon which the form rests.

“If they want you, they’ll want what you’ve got,” stealth marketer KC (Lauren Hutton) counsels her employee (David Duchovny) in “The Joneses.” In this commentary on modern American consumerism, director Derrick Borte explores the consequences of taking this advice to the limit. The film, graced with an original premise, a talented and well-cast group of actors, and a clever, well-paced script manages to be ironically funny, genuinely touching, and disturbing all at once. Borte critiques American society, but avoids heavy cynicism by allowing characters to form believable relationships, and by showing that even the Joneses can’t keep up with themselves.
Kate (Demi Moore), Steve (Duchovny), Mick (Ben Hollingsworth) and Jenn (Amber Heard) have been hired by a stealth-marketing agency to pose as “the Joneses” an all-American family of four. Planted in a wealthy gated community, they become walking advertisements for a wide range of luxury goods, from clothing to cars. The charismatic and attractive “family” easily wins the admiration and the wallets of the entire community, including their next-door neighbors Summer (Glen Headly) and Larry (Gary Cole). Moore sports a navy velour tracksuit, and the entire jogging club has to have it; Duchovny whips out a flashy new driver, and his golf buddies buy it as well. “The kids” quickly become popular at school, showcasing their share of headscarves, skateboards, and flat screen TVs.
Eventually, the Joneses become so good at what they do that the perfect marketing scheme begins to unravel. Mick successfully promotes his assigned punch brand, but serves so much to his underage friends that he indirectly causes a drunk driving accident. Larry, persuaded that his disinterested wife will come around if he buys her expensive gifts, buys more of Steve’s wares than he can afford. Meanwhile, the Joneses start to form genuine attachments to one another, beyond the familial bonds they must simulate as part of the job.
The way in which the Joneses mimic the tendencies of a normal American family is the source of both the movie’s clever humor and disturbing power. Even in the privacy of their own home, the relationships between Kate, Steve, Mick, and Jenn are not so far off from recognizable family dynamics. Moore, who doubles as the matriarch and the head of this particular advertising “unit,” skillfully imitates the ambitious career woman who puts her job before emotional intimacy, and constantly pressures her family members to reach their full “potential.“
Borte’s decision to cast Lauren Hutton as KC, the stylish, elderly marketing executive who periodically checks in on the Joneses, adds another dimension to the family dynamic. She takes on the role of the controlling grandmother, except that when she pesters Jenn about getting a boyfriend, it isn’t because she’d like to see her granddaughter happy, but because she wants to drive up sales.
These similarities between the Joneses and their genuine counterparts, though comically portrayed, are also troubling. They suggest that perhaps normal families operate around the goal of self-promotion. Are we just selling our images to one another, and to those around us? When parents encourage their children to excel, is it for their own betterment, or for the reflections of their success in popularity and material gain?
Borte shoots much of the film’s action in reflections—in mirrors, the sleek surfaces of the Jones home, and, during the climactic sequence, in a swimming pool. This technique effectively communicates the characters’ absorption in their own images, and how they define themselves through their purchases. It also accuses the viewer of engaging in the same kind of tireless self-promotion. Not only does our consumerism make us fall prey to advertisements, but our fixation with self-image puts us in danger of becoming advertisements ourselves.

In “Catullus 101,” the Roman poet writes an elegy for his brother, who died alone and far from home. This poem, which famously ends “Ave atque vale,” or “hail and farewell,” has inspired the elegies of generations of poets, from Alfred Lord Tennyson to Billy Collins. In her latest book, “Nox,” poet Anne Carson uses Catullus’ elegy as a lens through which to understand the death of her own brother. “I have loved this poem since the first time I read it in high school Latin class and I have tried to translate it a number of times. Nothing in English can capture the passionate, slow surface of a Roman elegy,” Carson writes. “No one (even in Latin) can approximate Catullan diction, which at its most sorrowful has an air of deep festivity, like one of those trees that turns all its leaves over, silver, in the wind.” However, though Carson claims that there is no satisfactory existing translation of the Latin poem, “Nox” impressively reveals her own personal—and heartbreaking—understanding of Catullus’ words.
This is by no means Carson’s first foray into classical literature. A professor of the Classics at the University of Michigan, Carson has translated works such as “If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho,” and more recently, “An Oresteia.” Her “Autobiography of Red” is a collection of narrative verse told from the point of view of the mythical figure Geryon. This latest book combines her skills as translator and poet; here, her careful translation of Catullus’ poem is combined with a series of short, narrative prose poems.
Advertised as a “book in a box,” “Nox” is an attempted reproduction of Carson’s journal from her period of mourning after the death of her brother. In addition to pieces of Catullus’ poem and Carson’s own writing, Carson has included reproductions of postcards and letters from her brother and mother, photographs of her family, and her own abstract sketches. The pages are designed to fold out in accordion style, so that in theory it is possible to view Carson’s entire book as one long page.
The decision to design the book in such an unusual fashion is questionable; the accordion-like pages are more difficult to handle than the leaves of a traditional book, and the hefty box that contains them is far more unwieldy than an average hardcover tome. An edition of “Nox” in which the poems, translations, letters, and photographs appeared as regular pages would be equally effective in recreating the poet’s attempt to understand her own grief.
It is, after all, Carson’s delicate efforts toward finding consolation that provide the driving force of her book. Towards the beginning of her journal, it seems that Carson tries to comfort herself through telling the story of her brother’s life: “My brother ran away in 1978, rather than go to jail. He wandered in Europe and India, seeking something, and sent us postcards or a Christmas gift, no return address. He was traveling on a false passport and living under other people’s names. This isn’t hard to arrange. It is irremediable. I don’t know how he made his decisions in those days. The postcards were laconic. He wrote only one letter, to my mother, the winter that girl died.” This exact wording is repeated several times, presented side by side with a reproduction of the one letter her brother wrote, as if by telling this narrative over and over, Carson hopes to come to an understanding of her brother’s inscrutable actions.
Interspersed with her exploration of the layers of her brother’s life, Carson similarly examines the layers of each individual word in Catullus’ elegy. Rather than attempting a simple translation, Carson displays entire dictionary entries on each Latin word in sequence with its appearance in Catullus’ poem. For the word “aequora,” for instance, she not only includes the direct definition—“a smooth or level surface”—but also an example of its usage, the translation of which is: “have we made it across the vast plain of night?” By including these long definitions alongside her own prose poems, Carson encourages a reading of each definition as if it were a poem in itself. Moreover, in presenting the many possible meanings of each Latin word, Carson creates a kind of translation that allows for the nuances that she feels are lost in any attempt to translate Catullus into English.
Carson also brings her translator’s eye to the words of her emotionally and physically distant brother. “Because our conversations were few (he phoned me maybe 5 times in 22 years) I study his sentences the ones I remember as if I’d been asked to translate them,” she writes. In translating, it is necessary to parse each word in an attempt to understand how it relates, thematically and grammatically, to every other word in the poem in which it appears. Carson studies with similar rigor each inexplicable decision her brother made and every conversation she had with him. Definition by definition, poem by poem, Carson slowly creates a portrait, not of her deceased brother’s personality or character, but of the effect of his absence on his family, both before and after his death.
Early on, Carson uses history as a way into her discussion of elegy, focusing on the Greek writer Herodotos: “Herodotos is an historian who trains you as you read. It is a process of asking, searching, collecting, doubting, striving, testing, blaming and above all standing amazed at the  strange things humans do.” The study of history often raises more questions, Herodotos argues, than it resolves. Carson’s elegy is indeed similar to Herodotos’ concept of history. Although she does not fully arrive at an understanding of her brother’s life, Carson seems to find consolation through the very process that Herodotos describes. In its collage of images, definitions, and poetry, “Nox,” creates a powerful visual and literary rendering of this poet’s searching, collecting, doubting, and blaming in the wake of the death of her mysterious but much mourned brother.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The strength and weakness of philosophical novels is that they often feel like a multiple choice test for which the author has circled several answers to the same question. Whereas a traditional philosopher must present a rigorous argument that is carefully constructed and proven, the philosophical novelist revels in the ambiguity of his or her characters, and the conflicting ideas that make up their lives and conversations. Rebecca Goldstein—who has made a career out of presenting philosophical concepts in fictional form—offers with her latest book a showcase of the advantages and frustrations attendant to this curious medium. “36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction” doesn’t settle any of the questions it raises, but it certainly edifies, entertains, and provokes.
Goldstein’s novel flits between two storylines in the life of affable academic Cass Seltzer, one in his present, the other in his past. Presently, Seltzer is contemplating an offer to assume a post at Harvard University, having achieved unexpected fame with his book, “The Varieties of Religious Illusion.” The combination of this secularist tract—and its appendix refuting 36 arguments for God’s existence—with Cass’s clear-eyed empathy for religious belief has turned him into an overnight celebrity, dubbed by Time Magazine as “the atheist with a soul.”
The novel’s flashback plotline explains how Seltzer came to write such a book, recounting his trajectory from life as a long-suffering graduate student in the humanities to becoming personally concerned with matters of faith. Under the tutelage of Jonas Elijah Klapper—a Harold Bloom caricature—Cass visited New Walden, a cloistered Hasidic enclave where men and women walk on different sides of the street and modernity has yet to intrude. There Cass meets Azarya, a child prodigy who at the age of six has derived complex mathematical proofs without any formal education. But Azarya is also the son of the town’s Grand Rebbe, expected to succeed his father as the Hasidim’s spiritual guide. Cass bears witness to Azarya’s agonizing choice between denying the secular world that so engages him or leaving his communal responsibilities and attending MIT—a struggle which informs Cass’s own thinking on religion’s roots and allure. While in the past Cass waits to discover what Azarya will decide, in the present readers wonder whether Cass will prevail in his upcoming religion-and-reason debate at Harvard against a neoconservative Nobel Laureate.
But the story is not entirely an intellectual adventure. Throughout the novel, Goldstein uses playful, everyday occurrences to creatively broach serious topics, deftly interweaving such diverse concepts as probability theory, the mind-body problem, and theodicy with Cass’s relationship issues and dinner conversations. Of course, innumerable thinkers over many centuries haven’t definitively solved the problem of evil, and Goldstein isn’t going to do it over dessert, but she does succeed in accessibly introducing a classic conundrum to her audience in the flow of her storytelling. So long as readers recognize that the positions debated in “36 Arguments for the Existence of God” are only the beginning of the conversation and not the end, Goldstein has accomplished her task. The job of the philosophical novelist is not so much to answer questions as to raise them.
Goldstein can introduce so many abstract concerns because she chooses here, as in many of her other books, to make her characters professional scholars, a territory she knows well. Seltzer’s academic career is narrated by Goldstein—a former fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, among other posts—with the skill of an insider. Given Goldstein’s background, Harvard students may find much that is familiar in Seltzer’s story. He works at a predominantly Jewish university named for a famous Jewish jurist—not Brandeis, of course, but the fictitious “Frankfurter University.” One of Seltzer’s colleagues is said to have been catapulted to a Harvard professorship when a mainstream publisher picked up his research on the psychology of happiness—a favorite subject of some of Harvard’s actual psychology lecturers, from Daniel Gilbert to Tal Ben-Shahar. And while the fictional Cass Seltzer did not debate Sir Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of Britain, at the London Jewish Book Festival, Goldstein’s husband, Harvard icon Steven Pinker, did in 2005. These adapted details of academia make Goldstein’s story that much more compelling, and her not infrequent satirical skewers of modern university life that much more biting.
When it comes to sketching Jewish tradition, and the life of New Walden’s Hasidim, however, Goldstein’s understanding is slightly weaker. She gets the names of Hasidic customs wrong—dubbing the mystical Hasidic custom of waiting to cut a boy’s hair until his third birthday an “upshneering” instead of the Yiddish “upsherin”—and her Klapper character deduces the numerical value of his Hebrew name using a form of gematria so obscure that Goldstein is either being very clever with his dialogue or is in error.
That Goldstein is much more at home in the academic realm than in the religious gradually becomes clear. For all her novel’s ambition to portray and explain the modern religious experience, it is unable to shake sufficiently free of its author’s initial presumptions. Like many new atheist tracts, “36 Arguments for the Existence of God” paints the religion-and-reason question in Manichean terms. This sort of framing can highlight sharp distinctions in philosophies, but doesn’t begin to approach the varieties of religious experience—or illusion—in the modern world. For Goldstein and her characters, the world divides into the rational and the irrational, the secular and the religious. There are the academics, who are either free of the superstitious bonds of faith or only subscribe to it for its social utility, and then there are the unenlightened masses. Azarya’s situation is similarly rigid—he must choose between living entirely outside modernity or entirely within it, when few such isolated shtetls as New Walden exist and few university students live a life so divorced from the concerns of the spirit.
Goldstein seems to be overlooking the very real people in between her extremes. Where is the celebrated Princeton philosopher Saul Kripke—a real life Azarya, who taught at MIT while a Harvard undergrad, himself an observant Jew and critic of materialism—and where is Harvard’s own Hilary Putnam, who writes on Jewish thought and prays at Harvard Hillel, or Francis Collins, the head of the Human Genome Project and a believing Christian?
For all its intellectual banter, witty academic satire and thoughtful portrayal of religious life and community—all of which make this a far more elegant and effective work than any new atheist polemic—“36 Arguments for the Existence of God” still simplifies its subject, and so falls short of meeting its own ambitious standards. A novel that considers rational religionists and non-materialists on their own terms, while maintaining its strong intellectual reservations, would make a worthy sequel to this excellent but incomplete entry into the genre.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the brink of the 19th century, in the Scottish town of Dumfries, the poet Robert Burns wrote: “the honest man, tho’ e’er sae poor / Is king o’ men for a’ that.” Two centuries later, and about 100 miles away in St Andrews, poet and musician Don Paterson is striving for the same down-to-earth honesty in his fifth volume of poetry, “Rain.” In this new collection, Paterson amasses popular images of sentimentality and reimagines them amid the hectic cacophony of contemporary life.
Paterson was born in Dundee, at the eastern edge of Scotland. In the spirit of a troubadour, he began writing poetry while he worked as a jazz musician in London. Since his first book of poetry, “Nil Nil,” Paterson has achieved serious recognition, receiving honors such the T.S. Eliot Prize and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. Most recently, he has received the Queen’s Gold Medal for Poetry.
His aspirations as a jazz musician, which preceded his interest in poetry, continue to have a strong influence on his verse. For Paterson, poetry is first and foremost a transcription of music—“sing me that old silent song,” he writes. His ear for music is evident in the formal construction of his poems, in which he often employs straightforward rhyme schemes. His poem “The Swing,” for instance, strictly follows the ballad form. He writes, “the bright sweep of its radar-arc / is all the human dream / handing us from dark to dark / like a rope over a stream.” One can easily hear the oscillating, swing-like rhythm, and this type of melodic accessibility permeates the entire book.
Paterson draws on a wide range of poetic conventions, alluding to poets of a remarkable range of nationalities, from Chinese classical poets Li Po and Du Fu, to the French surrealist Robert Desnos and the Peruvian poet César Vallejo. Though he always chooses to write in clear cut poetic forms, he draws these forms from traditions across the globe. It is impressive to find a poet who writes in a Scottish dialect in one poem—“I’m staunin here upricht, wi’ you”—and in the Japanese poetic form of Renku in another.
Just as he uses easily-recognizable forms, Paterson also takes on a familiar, didactic voice. The poem “Correctives” depicts the narrator’s son who uses his right hand to support his left in an effort to write more neatly. As he describes this boy, Paterson derives a broader conclusion about humanity from the image: “the whole man must be his own brother / for no man is himself alone.” It would be easy to imagine this brief poem as a sort of family maxim delivered from generation to generation.
Although Paterson tends to use older and more traditional verse forms, his book also shows a firm grip on present-day life, displayed in his nonchalant attitude and a variety of witticisms. In the montage-like sequence “Renku: My Last Thirty-five Deaths,” Paterson at times sounds almost too playful to be taken seriously. “If I had a happier dream / this might have been a better poem,” he writes. However, it is precisely this addition of levity that offsets the often overly-sentimental voice that takes precedence in some of his other poems. Another large portion of “Rain” is composed of mysterious narratives. Paterson’s mystery, however, does not demand a literary interpretation or decoding, but simply asks to be absorbed, as a child might listen to a fairy tale. The opening poem of the volume, “Two Trees,” tells a story of Don Miguel who grafts an orange tree to a lemon tree. The hybrid orange-lemon tree mysteriously brings forth “two lights in the dark leaves” before it is axed in half by the subsequent owner of the garden. Paterson implies at the end of the poem, that there is no hidden message in this tale: “They were trees, and trees don’t weep or ache or shout. / And trees are all this poem is about.”
The simplicity of “Two Trees” is characteristic of the collection as a whole. Paterson’s straightforward rhythms, earnest tones, and candid narratives are equally approachable to poetry novices and veterans alike. Paterson shows a consistently genuine and honest appreciation of ordinary human life. In the title poem, Paterson writes, “I love all films that start with rain... / However bad or overlong / such a film can do no wrong.” Like the images of rain that Paterson admires, his own brand of poetic sincerity, “however bad or overlong” still manages to revitalize forms and subjects that might otherwise seem too traditional or overused.

Living in Cabot House can be a drag, but a widely circulated e-mail last week suggested that "a night of wild debauchery" might improve the state of affairs in the faraway Quad House.
An e-mail first sent out on the Wigglesworth e-mail list advertising a dining hall party by the name of "Let's Have Sex in Cabot" had some undergrads scratching their heads over whether Cabot had suddenly become a much more attractive place to live.
But, alas, Cabot has not taken to impersonating Harvard's more promiscuous Houses.
The e-mail was, in fact, sent out as an advertisement for the latest episode of On Harvard Time, which includes a surprisingly hilarious segment on dining hall parties.
But the joke was lost on some.
"Some people thought it was real and asked me where to get tickets," said Rebecca J. Margolies '13, one of the original authors of the e-mail.
According to Margolies, an unnamed UC rep found the e-mail astoundingly "heteronormative" while another student told her upon reading the e-mail, "Oh my god! Ew! I can't believe people would go to that."
But maybe something along these lines—sex, debauchery, etc.—is what it will take to boost attendance at dining hall parties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like a scarlet letter, an accusation of plagiarism is perhaps the most devastating fate that can befall a man or woman of letters. Doris Kearns Goodwin, for instance, will never quite enjoy the same reputation she had before scandal erupted over an unquoted passage in “The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys;” Stephen E. Ambrose, who copied from no fewer than twelve sources over the course of writing seven books, may as well be known as academia’s Samuel Mudd.
In an era that vilifies writers like these, it goes without saying that defenders of plagiarists are few and far between. Few, for instance, would dare defend a writer like Kaavya Viswanathan ’08, whose novel—“How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild, and Got a Life”—borrows more than just a few words from several previously published books. Few, that is, except for David Shields, who, in “Reality Hunger,” maintains that Viswanathan must be considered an artist precisely because—and not in spite—of her obvious plagiarism.
Referencing Viswanathan’s novel in one of the 618 numbered vignettes that constitutes “Reality Hunger,” Shields reveals his disappointment at the media’s smear-campaign against the young author, then a Harvard sophomore: “Excuse me, but isn’t the entire publishing industry built on telling the exact same stories over and over again?” he asks. “I don’t feel any of the guilt normally attached to ‘plagiarism,’ which seems to me organically connected to creativity itself.”
And that, in a nutshell, is the exactly sort of the statement—somewhat provocative and intentionally theatrical—that has made “Reality Hunger” into a topic of conversation since its publication. The book, a self-proclaimed “manifesto,” is as elusive of genre classification as it is resistant to a simple encapsulation. At once a meditation on the idea of truth in art, “Reality Hunger” also comes off as rallying cry for what Shields describes as “an organic and as-yet-unstated” artistic movement—the idea of the collage, a blend of media forms welded together that can shed far more light on the mysteries of existence than can the sort of simple, reductive plot that governs most novels and films.
In other words, collages are “real” in that they do not attempt to distort or to reduce the absurdity of the universe into palatable packages for the viewer to take away; they are “real” because they help to explain that absurdity to a viewer who is all too often deceived into believing that some easy, take-away message exists in every inexplicable situation.
Of course, “Reality Hunger” itself is meant as an example of the sort of collage for which Shields so loudly clamors throughout the book: it has no narrative structure whatsoever, is told in a series of dubiously related vignettes—some like essays, others like haikus—and draws upon a wealth of examples from culture as highbrow as Proust and as lowbrow as reality television shows. “Nothing is going to happen in this book,” Shields writes.
And while Shields’s decision to construct “Reality Hunger” in the style of the art he most values supplements the reader’s ability to grasp some of the more confusing propositions in the text, the book’s status as a “manifesto” is ultimately problematic, since it is unclear for what exactly “Reality Hunger” can be said to be a ‘manifesto.’ The term implies the creation of an innovative world view, philosophy, or theory—basically, the advent of something new. And although Shields certainly believes his book to elucidate the development of a new art form, one that blurs to the point of invisibility the “distinction between fiction and nonfiction” as per “the lure and blur of the real,” what he advocates is not exactly new, and, as such, does not—at least in terms of content—earn its status as such.
“If you want to write serious books, you must be ready to break the forms,” he tells us. As an artist, one must understand that what matters is not some artificial plot but rather the truth—or, in other words, the “reality”—one conveys. Shields writes, “[It’s] not the story. It’s just this breathtaking world—that’s the point.” If these are the foundations of Shields’ manifesto, has all of this not been said before? Can Shields be given credit for tracking the development of a “new” art form that, considering the work of artists as diverse as Virginia Woolf and Samuel Beckett—both of whom Shields references extensively throughout his book—can be said to have developed along with the rise of modernity?
Woolf and Beckett should not be considered as artists in pursuit of the same common goal, but according to Shields, the work of each nevertheless demonstrates certain aspects of the “reality” Shields demands in art: the replacement of traditional plot structure for the uninhibited emotional current of stream-of-consciousness narration in one and the fixation on the absurd in the other. However, Woolf, Beckett, and countless others who practiced these techniques wrote generations before “Reality Hunger” ever hit the shelves. To that end, what good is a manifesto if it appears almost a century after the “innovations” it champions first began to appear?
Although Shields has given voice to the artistic controversies of recent years—Oprah Winfrey’s war on James Frey, the prevalence and popularity of reality television, the question of whether people still want to read novels in the Information Age—“Reality Hunger,” with its fixation on literary and artistic forms that developed long before Shields ever came of age, seems a bit out of sequence. While the ideas Shields espouses—a greater emphasis on truth instead of the artificiality inherent in traditional narrative structures—are valid, they seem to be ideas that most students of literature will have encountered at some point or other in their career. In other words, it is the novelty Shields believes his book to carry—the fact that he considers it a manifesto to herald in a new age that seems to have arrived long ago—that is the problem.

“Can you make good from bad? What is art, and what is musical theater as art?” asks director of “High School Musical Scenes” Daniel V. Kroop ’10.
Kroop and his cast will explore these questions in an unconventional adaptation of the popular Disney Channel hit, “High School Musical,” from April 23-24, with two midnight showings in the Adams Pool Theater.
The film version of “High School Musical” tells the story of sensitive basketball jock Troy Bolton (Gus T. Hickey ’11) and a beautiful science nerd Gabriella Montez (Samara R. Oster ’13). Despite existing in completely different social circles, they fall in love and challenge the status quo by coming together to audition for their yearly high school musical.
While the movie is typical Disney fare, replete with cheesy songs, over-exaggerated characters, and bright colors, Kroop’s adaptation cuts the music and condenses the script to just under an hour.
“The idea was to make the scenes valuable and bring out the power of the ‘High School Musical’ script without the music,” Oster says.
Kroop also adds that the removal of the musical distractions allows the more serious questions of the script come to light.
“Are different choices irreconcilable in high school? How do these hierarchies affect us? Can you break them down?” Kroop asks.
And the director explains that this production is also an exploration in form, as the play delves into the meaning of musicals without the defining element of song.
“If you remove the music from it, you explain the idea of what it means to be a musical,” he says.
Despite the seriousness of these creative inquiries, the show is primarily intended to be an amusing and entertaining one.
“We want the audience to come with a lot of levity and enjoyment in their hearts, and then get wrapped up in what’s going on,” Kroop says.

Based on two upcoming festivals in the Boston area, breaking down conventional barriers is the new “it” thing to do in the performance art world. The 2nd Annual Harvard Playwrights’ Festival and the 1st Annual Boston-wide Emerging America performance festival have this goal in mind as they prepare for large Spring celebrations and collaborations. The Playwrights’ Festival seeks to bridge gaps between different pre-professional aspects of undergraduate theater, while Emerging America hopes to build a connection between three professional companies and the Boston public.
The Harvard Playwrights’ Festival runs from Thursday, April 22, to Sunday, April 25, in the New College Theatre Studio, and features the original works of ten undergraduates performed as staged readings. For most of these students, the festival is the culmination of a semester of writing in Briggs-Copeland Lecturer Christine M. Evans’ Advanced Playwriting Course, offered through the English Department.
“The right outcome for a play is to do it in the theater, not to hand it in inside a binder,” says Evans, who was responsible for last Spring’s inaugural festival. According to Evans, theater is a collaborative art, and so she seeks to enhance this collaboration at the undergraduate level. Instrumental to the project are the teaming of undergraduates with graduate actors at the American Repertory Theater (A.R.T.) Institute and the introduction of professional directors. New to this year’s festival are the inclusion of undergraduate actors and the performance of original works. Evans wants budding playwrights to “think entrepreneurially about how to get their work out there in the future, and that all comes from collaboration.”
“It’s been a wild process,” says Evans’ student Cecelia A. Raker ’11, whose play “Lilacs in November” will run on Sunday at the festival. Raker, who has been involved with directing and acting on campus, has experimented in playwriting but never to this serious an extent. “To step out of my comfort zone and do something entirely original, or more original, is something that I’ve loved,” she says.
Raker, who is pursuing a special concentration in Theater, especially appreciates the level of professionalism associated with the course and the festival. “The dramaturges have been incredible,” says Raker. “This has been a freeing experience.”
Raker also feels all the students’ plays reflect their exposure to such high-level resources. “It’s been great to hear other people’s work,” she raves. “We’ve got plays ranging from mine, which is totally a surreal fantasy, to very realist family drama, and everything in between.”
For those who are not necessarily as artistically inclined, Emerging America—a joint-festival presented by three established Boston-area theater companies—has a simpler goal: exposing the public to new performances by upcoming American artists. The festival, put on by the A.R.T., the Huntington Theater Company, and the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston (ICA), will premiere from Friday, May 14, to Sunday, May 16. This is a new venture for the three companies, all of which have undergone important changes in the past three years; the A.R.T. and the Huntington have welcomed new artistic directors, and the ICA has only recently added theatrical performance to their agenda. David J. Henry, the ICA’s Director of Public Programs, says, “We’re hoping to be able to generate some energy in Boston for new theater.”
The companies will be joining together to publicize and celebrate the event with a parade and an opening night party. For the duration of the weekend, the festival will consist of several independent productions by emerging American theater artists at each respective location.
Publicity for the event kicks off with the parade in Cambridge on Sunday, May 2. According to Henry, the parade functions to both increase awareness and to engage the community actively. Local artists and art organizations have been invited to take part in this event, but everyone in the community is encouraged to participate. “If anyone wants to join this, we’re happy to have them,” Henry says.
After the first production, the Experiment America kickoff party will commence at the ICA, with impromptu performances scattered throughout. “You might not know the person standing next to you is a performer until they’re well into their act,” Henry says. He adds, “It will eventually break out into a giant dance party.”
The companies involved anticipate this effort—to make production tools more accessible to playwrights and make plays more inviting to the general public—will be a positive one. Between peer performances, parades, and dance parties, these on- and off-campus festivals hope to offer something for everyone to engage in and appreciate.

Imagine a world in which every fairy tale collides. Cinderella wants to go to the ball, Jack has to sell his cow for magic beans, Little Red Riding Hood brings food to her grandmother’s, Rapunzel is stuck in her tower, hoping for a prince. There is also a baker and his wife, both of whom have a curse put upon them for transgressions long ago.
All of these storylines converge in legendary composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim and writer James Lapine’s Tony-Award winning musical comedy “Into the Woods.” The work explores the aforementioned characters’ lives and the struggles they face in the fairy-tale world they live in. But the twist is that in this adaptation, the characters don’t necessarily live happily ever after, but have to face the consequences of fulfilling their desires.
“I want people to come, and I want people to laugh. And if they come away with understanding the moral of the story that’s all I can hope for,” says director Jordan A. Reddout ’10.
But be warned, there are major changes to come during the second half of the musical. According to Reddout, the show will take a darker turn when the consequences of the actions in the first half are made visible and culminate in a series of events that sometimes literally crushes the dreams of the characters.
“There’s a really big aesthetic shift between act one and act two, and I wanted to delve into the classic fairy book style to a more stark and darker tone. That’s what I see in the second act when everything gets destroyed—there’s a darker aesthetic,” she says.
The director says her main focus is to draw the audience into the musical, while still maintaining the comedy and the work’s message, all in the hopes of making the show as much fun to watch as possible.
“I think that a lot of the time in Harvard theater people choose shows that are obscure, or dark, or have really heavy meaning, and I think that ‘Into the Woods’ has meaning but also a fun, relaxed atmosphere,” Reddout says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past two years, most mention of Allston seem to be followed by the phrase “Science Complex,” but media attention directed towards the University’s plan for expanding its science programming into the neighborhood neglects another element of its expansion. At one point, the future of Allston also included details for incorporating the University’s art museums. Though recently the Science Complex has eclipsed this part of the project, last week the role that arts will play in Allston has once again come to the forefront.
At Harvard, where institutional memory is short, but university planning is often long-term, it is easy to forget (or to never have known) that plans for development in Allston once included much more than simply the Science Complex. The University’s master plan comprised an initiative to move the Fogg Museum to Allston and to create a modern art museum in the neighborhood. A location was even selected for the project.
But in 2007, the emphasis on the arts element of the Allston plan was replaced with a focus on the Science Complex. That year, the University finally got the go-ahead from the Boston Redevelopment Association to break ground on the $1 billion state-of-the-art science research facility that it hoped would become a mecca for stem cell research. The project would herald a new concentration—Human Regenerative and Developmental Biology—and provide a space to house the department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. But just four months ago, University President Drew G. Faust announced an indefinite halt on construction of the Science Complex due to financial constraints.
The original delay on the construction of arts facilities in Allston has had ramifications even until the beginning of this year. In January, Helen Molesworth, the head of the modern and contemporary art department at Harvard, left the University for the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in Boston.
“I had been hired to help Harvard build a new museum across the river,” Molesworth told the Globe. But one day she said she thought, “The ICA is that building. I should probably call.”
Despite the reality of Harvard’s fiscal situation hindering the progress of plans in Allston, during this past week the potential for expanding the arts in the neighborhood has resurfaced. The Silk Road Project, a nonprofit arts and educational organization created by world-renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma ’76, announced that it will move its headquarters to a Harvard property in Allston this coming July.
The Silk Road Project remains an entity separate from the University. But Ma says that the move from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, R.I., where its headquarters originally were, to Allston is motivated by a desire to be more involved with Harvard since its successful completion of a five-year residency at the college.
“By actually being more on campus we can have a deeper engagement with and understanding of what’s actually happening at the University,” he says, adding that he hopes the Silk Road Project will be involved with creating new course offerings at the University, in addition to hosting symposia on subjects ranging from the state of the arts to community involvement.
University officials confirmed that the Silk Road will likely be involved with Harvard on a curricular level.
“The move will enliven our imagination as we continue to develop ‘Silk Road Courses,’ of which we already have created three in the FAS,” writes the college’s divisional dean of the arts and humanities, Diana Sorensen, in an e-mail. “Joining forces with and deriving inspiration from Mr. Ma’s organization, we hope to continue creating more innovative courses that focus on the notions of material exchange, culture and understanding across cultural divides.”
Indeed, what Ma describes as “a lab for interdisciplinary and creative work,” will now find its home in Allston, bringing to the vanguard questions of the place of arts in the neighborhood.
“The original planning for Allston has always been much more multi-dimensional than just science,” Faust says.
Lori E. Gross, the Associate Provost of Arts and Culture, echoes these sentiments.
“Arts and culture has always been part of the long term plan in Allston,” she says.
Yet the administration’s language on the subject remains vague. “In due course Allston will be a wonderful space for artistic experimentation and collaboration,” Sorensen writes.  “It will offer not only our students and faculty unique cultural activities, but it will also share them with the Allston residents in innovative, fruitful ways, facilitating cultural citizenship and entrepreneurship.”
Gross agrees, stressing that plans must be considered “very strategically” due to financial constraints, but that one of the purposes of the Task Force on the Arts is to ensure that the arts be at the table in conversations about the future of the University.

What makes a pirate? Is it the cutlass, the distinctive tri-corner hat, or the swashbuckling disdain for authority? The pirates of W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance”—which runs through May 2 at the Agassiz Theatre—share a radically different defining characteristic: profoundly patriotic monarchism. As they sing in the show, “With all our faults, we love our Queen.” Faults or no, the irresistible energy of the cast makes “The Pirates of Penzance” one lovable show.
The pirates’ unorthodox love for the Queen is by no means the only paradox “The Pirates of Penzance” presents; in fact, Gilbert and Sullivan seem to have delighted in irony. The plot rests on an absurdity built into the contract of Pirate Apprentice Frederic (Benjamin J. Nelson ’11), whose nurse signed him up to serve as a pirate not for 21 years but for 21 birthdays—an unfortunate choice of terms considering that Frederic was born on February 29, which means that at age 21 he’s had only five birthdays.
Despite his situation, Frederic sings of his love for a good paradox, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players (HRG&SP) seem to share that affection. And, ultimately, it’s the way the Players handle these paradoxes with earnest delight and abundant charm that makes “The Pirates of Penzance” so irresistibly enjoyable.
Most enjoyable of all are a series of three magnificently overblown introductions that build up a cast of bombastic, magnetic supporting characters: Mabel, the Major-General, and the Sergeant of Police. Mabel (Bridget P. Haile ’11), Frederic’s love interest and daughter of Major-General Stanley, bursts onto the scene with a warbling, upper-register tour-de-force that—in addition to causing Frederic to visibly swoon—immediately captures Mabel’s simple-hearted desire to impress.
Her father (Benjamin T. Morris ’09) follows suit with his hilarious introductory song, “I am the very model of a modern Major-General.” He delivers his performance with confident, prim inflection at a break-neck pace, capturing the Major-General’s character from the first sure-handed note. His assurance that he can provide “many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse” provides laughs.
Considering the relative smallness of his role, the Sergeant of Police (Philipp W. Grimm ’11) is the biggest surprise of the show. Grimm’s Chaplin-esque strut and alternatively glazed and manic eyes make his Sergeant absolutely aloof but somehow loveable. He heads up a police corps that proves just as memorable as the pirates themselves.
However, these pirates do not disappoint. The Pirate King (Ilan J. Caplan ’10) has a gravitas that makes one of the show’s many exuberant refrains infectious: “But I’ll be true to the song I sing, and live and die a Pirate King.” The strength of the supporting cast sometimes threatens to overwhelm Frederic’s character—which Nelson, either purposefully or not, imbues with a sense of weakness—but that is, perhaps, the point. Frederic—who stubbornly holds to his idea of duty even in morally complex situations—is essentially a feeble character, and only his love for Mabel begins to change that.
The cast’s near-absolute success undoubtedly owes much to the show’s orchestra, conducted by music director Jesse C. Wong ’12. The overture is a highlight, tracing the course of the story in its movement from a gentle beginning to an adventurous final section, underscored by a mood of light cheer. The entire production is an outgrowth of this delightful music, and the orchestra’s vigorous playing and professional—yet relaxed—attitude make them an integral part of the show. When “Pirates” is at its best, it feels more like a musical celebration than an opera.
Other elements of the show’s design are subdued, helping the performers establish the celebratory atmosphere. The costume design of Janice J. He ’11 is all simplicity and pastels—bright, but understated. Likewise, the set pieces designed by Matthew B. Bird ’10 are blocky and cartoonish, supplementing the play’s feeling of unreality. The pirates’ boat onstage as the play begins points to this abstract, yet effective impression. These designs rightly place the focus on the performers themselves—as one particularly memorable episode in which the curtains close behind Frederic, Ruth, and the Pirate King illustrates—and those performers seldom fail to charm.
The show may not charm all equally. Gilbert and Sullivan’s humor is invested in pun and wordplay, a mixture of high-brow and slapstick that may stray too far in either direction for some. The sheer length of the play means the performers are up against the task of sustaining a frenetic pace set by the vigor of Mabel and the Major-General’s introductions. Yet, the constant introduction of new characters and the performers’ unfailing energy generally meet that challenge.
If nothing else, “Pirates” conveys that what makes a pirate is not his eye patch, but his love for the Queen. Similarly, what makes this rendition of “The Pirates of Penzance” is nothing more complex than its cast and crew’s sense of fun.

In recent years, Yardfest has featured artists who were bland (Sara Bareilles), out-of-date (Third Eye Blind), pleasingly out-of-place (Wu Tang Clan), and actually very good (Ratatat). By crowding this year’s bill with three acts, the Harvard Concert Commission and College Events Board (CEB) had the chance to bring in an even wider diversity of groups to entertain the campus.
Patrick Park, Wale, and Kid Cudi certainly each have their own styles and merits. Park’s gentle folk clearly sets itself apart from his hip-hop counterparts, although the latter two artists also differ vastly in style. Wale relies on flow and samples while Cudi lays down his own original, if less-innovative, beats. However, on Sunday all three artists proved incapable of consistently commanding attention, leaving this year’s Yardfest to be a rather stale and second-rate affair.
Perhaps the least disappointing of the three artists was Park, if only because expectations for him were so much lower. Park was an inoffensive and unexciting choice, and his late afternoon performance lived up to this billing. He has a pleasant voice, capable of conveying emotion without straining his voice to cloying effect. Standing alone on the stage, his unaccompanied guitar and vocals eased through a set of consistent and perfectly acceptable tracks. Nothing in particular stood out, and the only moment when the crowd truly became engaged was when CEB members rather disrespectfully started throwing out T-shirts in the middle of “Here We Are.” To his credit, Park played professionally and displayed a relaxed charm in his banter.
Expectations were much higher for Wale, and he did put on a better show than Park, although it was not as good as had been hoped for. His twilight set began extremely promisingly with Jay-Z samples and a stimulating light show exciting the audience in a way that Park never managed. Whereas Park merely tapped toes and exchanged glances, Wale at least made attempts to excite the crowd, with hand-waving, cursing, and the universal epithet “you know what I’m sayin’.” And although this didn’t single-handedly save the show, it at least made the set decently entertaining, while the other artists left the audience hanging.
Wale’s hour-long set dragged on for two or three songs too many, and though it began energetically, it felt like he could have better maintained the pace. “I haven’t done a show this sober in a year,” he told the audience at one point, and perhaps the deficiency of liquid courage explains why his performance dropped off towards the end. The rapper’s flow should not be overlooked; multiple unaccompanied verses by Wale exhibited his natural talent at the art. However, he seemed to fail at inserting this skill into his normal clip-filled songs or, more troublingly, knowing when to stop. His showman skills also failed him at the end of his set. Final track “Beautiful Bliss” petered out unspectacularly and Wale briefly exhorted his audience to follow him on Twitter before leaving the stage, providing an unremarkable ending to the performance. Nevertheless, Wale stood out, sandwiched between two even less remarkable acts.
Kid Cudi was the headliner of the bill and clearly the highest-profile act on display, but his equivocating performance failed to meet the pre-concert expectations. He was the undoubted musical highlight of the concert, but his performance failed to offer anything that could not have been experienced by listening to his album or mixtapes in the comfort of one’s own room. Cudi’s fast-paced beats did not translate well into conscripted, event-tent performance and, although the blinding light show impressively lit up the now-dark Yard, Cudi’s unenergetic body movement and overly-casual tone failed to ignite the show.
Cudi’s regular set ended with easily his most famous song, “Day ‘n’ Nite,” the perfect example of how his set failed to move beyond his recorded output. For the first half he performed the well-known Crookers Remix of the song, which perfectly reproduced the ample dance beats of the original, and little else. Other than a few shout-outs to his first album, the majority of Cudi’s set consisted of underground songs that he cited from his pre-fame mix-tapes. And while these tracks deserve merit, they were not what the audience had been waiting for. It must be said that in general, Kid Cudi does not have an extensive repertoire to speak of; his hit-list is easily exhausted. However, his biggest songs were rationed at odd and uneven intervals, which in many cases killed the show’s overall momentum. Cudi’s first exit was unexpected, and while his encore of hits, “Sky Might Fall” and “Pursuit of Happiness,” was welcome, it still served as the end to a short, predictable, and unenthusiastic show overall.
Cudi’s performance was the culmination of an event that never achieved any kind of liftoff. All three artists struggled to present a consistent and compelling momentum. Though Wale was the highlight, he still exhibited the lack of consistent energy that held the entire evening back. Despite having more artists than in previous years, this year’s Yardfest failed to stand out from the rest.

Within the first five seconds of opening track, “Odessa,” it is apparent that Caribou’s latest release, “Swim,” is very different from his last. 2007’s “Andorra,” the previous full-length release by the electronic artist and Ontario native David Snaith, was a record of textures, the kind of album that is best appreciated alone, eyes closed, with headphones on. 40-odd minutes of meandering, unpredictable soundscapes, “Andorra” waxed and waned but never climaxed, never really accelerated. The result was a deservedly acclaimed album of ambient electronica that was unhurried yet gorgeous, atmospheric yet unpretentious.
A wavering synth line straight out of a 1980s disco and a drumbeat more propulsive than any found on “Andorra” introduce “Odessa,” and give listeners a very good hint at what Caribou is trying to accomplish with “Swim.” After years of balancing dream pop, noise, and spaced-out electronica, this is Caribou’s dance record.
Or rather, it tries to be. “Odessa” is perhaps the best thing Caribou has ever released—a throbbing, dubstep-inflected track whose breathy vocals float over a bed of fluid bass and punchy, off-kilter percussion. And the two tracks that follow it, “Sun” and “Kaili,” form a brilliant triple act with “Odessa,” venturing daringly into various subgenres of dance but with a firm safety line linking them to Caribou’s dreamy home territory. Soon enough, though, that line starts to drag the record back towards Caribou’s earlier sound, and “Swim” experiences something of an identity crisis. Caribou seems to lose his nerve, and the meandering, spacey sounds of “Andorra” reappear.
The combination of genres sounds promising. With the three opening tracks of “Swim,” Caribou shows he can do dance. And he’s proven with remarkable consistency over a decade of music-making that he can do ambient electronica. But somehow, when those two aspects merge in songs like “Bowls” and “Leave House,” they lose much of what makes them compelling in the process. Less than the sum of its parts, the record’s middle section decelerates and de-energizes the music, and the result is little more than tedious.
“Leave House” wanders through tweeting woodwinds and sinusoidal synths without any apparent destination in mind. “Bowls” switches genre halfway through, starting with an intriguing but uninspired wash of strings and chiming percussion before segueing into a fairly standard dancefloor-filling riff. Perhaps the worst offender is “Hannibal,” which clearly aspires to be a dance track but, for all its echoes of New Order and layered instrumentals, never achieves liftoff, sinking instead into a repetitive morass. None of these tracks are exactly bad, but they all feels slightly aimless, lacking both the propulsive physicality of Caribou’s dance music and the fragile beauty of his spaced-out electronica.
With “Lalibela” and “Jamelia,” Caribou gives up completely and returns to his more airy roots, and the songs are better for it. The former, in particular, uses swelling, melancholic synthesizers and delicately whispered vocals to haunting effect. While “Lalibela” recalls the best of Caribou’s previous releases, that song and “Jamelia” are strange fits on an album dominated by pulsating drum-and-bass beats. Still, they’re a welcome break from the indecisiveness of “Swim’s” fallow middle section.
This indecisiveness, rather than the music itself, is what holds “Swim” back. The album seems to reside in an odd limbo, demonstrating superb dance tracks and Caribou’s continuing mastery of his familiar fields, but failing to commit to a cohesive vision of either. The album’s confusion might induce a little nostalgia for the sweeping sounds of “Andorra.” But more than anything, Caribou should be applauded for his courage in releasing a record that strays far from the formula of his previous releases. The only disappointment is that he didn’t go far enough.

In the opening scene of “The Pillowman,” a man, covered to the waist in a rough burlap sack, lies sprawled on a table, while a lone wooden rocking horse rests forgotten in a corner. In this one eerie visual tableau, the play’s thematic juxtaposition of childhood innocence and dark violence is powerfully established. This startling contrast underscores the drama of the entire production. Directed by Ilinca Radulian ’11, and playing at the Loeb Experimental Theater until April 24, “The Pillowman” is a dark and comedic theatrical experience whose character-driven plot comes to life with the skillfully nuanced acting of a four-person cast. Accented by glimmers of dark humor, creative props, and an unusual set, “The Pillowman” creates a haunting world of philosophical and psychological complexity.
The play tells the story of Katurian (James R. Morris GSAS ’10), a young writer who is taken into police custody because a string of recent murders emulate the plots of his gruesomely violent children’s stories. When his mentally retarded twin sister, Michal (Isabel Q. Carey ’12), confesses to the murders, Katurian accepts the fact that he will soon be executed, but desperately struggles to ensure his stories are preserved after his death. The play is told, in part, through reenactments of Katurian’s tales, including a darkly autobiographical vignette that pins the root of his perverse imagination to the experience of hearing his parents torture Michal during their childhood.
Skinny and animated, with a mop of brown curls, Morris is equal parts charming and helpless, for he immediately draws the audience in with his panicked anxiety and confusion about his sudden imprisonment. It seems impossible that such a charismatic and haphazard individual could pen horrific tales of child murder, or suffocate his parents with pillows at the age of 14, but Morris skillfully captures the chiaroscuro of his character’s vulnerability and violence.
Isabel Q. Carey ’12 conveys through her body the psychological destruction of her mind. In the scene where Katurian rescues her from torture, the pair rise and fall together in a dance sequence that captures the heartbreakingly graceful fragility of their limp and beaten bodies.  Later, Carey imbues her psychologically stunted character with charming youthful energy, pulling at her toes, stretching her arms, and kicking up her feet in a convincing portrayal of youthful vibrancy. Carey navigates her role with nuance, as she is able to realize the wide-eyed, giggly antics of Michal without verging on what could easily have become a cloying depiction of childhood.
Tupolski (Jackson M. Kernion ’12) and Ariel (Dan J. Giles ’13), the detectives who keep Katurian in custody, complete the cast. The pair effectively opens with the classic “good cop, bad cop” routine, only to reverse their roles as the plot develops. Kernion is cool, cunning, and calculated, while Giles positively burns with aggression and rage, lashing out in fury at the slightest provocation. Giles’s thundering demeanor is artfully tempered, however, by the presence of a few childlike habits, such as a penchant for sucking on lollipops. These unexpected touches add depth to his performance and invoke the disturbing contrast between youthful innocence and graphic violence that permeates the play.
The props in “The Pillowman” are as arresting and inventive as the portrayal of the characters, and further contribute to the mood of anxiety and fear in the play. Instead of actual books depicting Katurian’s stories, a stack of blank white sheets with cutout silhouettes of children represent the writer’s haunting tales. A note scrawled in blood is bundled as a tightly-wound accordion, so that the words on the folio explode as a red streak when the note is unfurled.
Giles often dons garishly gender-bending outfits to depict frightful women in narrated performances of Karturian’s stories. In one, he forces a tight red dress and thick strands of pearls over his detective’s uniform. Even more bizarre, Katurian’s costume for the Pillowman (a character from one of his stories) is a blanket-jacket with sleeves and a bonnet-like pillow-hat which, though giving the appearance of softness, belies his life’s sinister work.
The set evokes the sense of claustrophobia in “The Pillowman”—psychological because of the brutal torture the detectives inflict on Katurian and physical because of the intense proximity mediated by the space of the Loeb Ex itself. The set incorporates a giant translucent box, an even smaller cage imposed in the room where Katurian is imprisoned. The box is meant to represent the room where Michal was tortured as a child. Whether illuminated with sinister green neon during a scene of violence, or adorned along its edges with garlands of somber flowers in moments of quiet mourning, the set piece is a striking and unusually effective accent to the performance.
The show’s score, though used sparingly, enhances the production’s chilling tone. In Katurian’s confession scene, a spooky, romping rock riff injects the play with electric energy. At other times, the faint, haunting sounds of a children’s choir waft over Katurian narrating his horrid tales or characters recounting painful memories.
Ultimately, ”The Pillowman” raises a number of darkly philosophical questions about the accountability of the mentally ill in violent crimes, the responsibility artists have for the emotions provoked by their art, and, perhaps most painfully, whether victims of violent abuse are ever capable of healing. Katurian seems to provide an answer to this final uncertainty when he snarls at his sister, “There are no happy endings in real life!” “The Pillowman” does not have a happy ending either—but it is this raw and unflinching exploration of complex, volatile issues which makes the show an intelligent, thought-provoking drama.

“Who’s ever been free in this world / Who has never had to bleed in this world?” questions a brooding Rufus Wainwright in his newest effort, “All Days Are Nights: Songs for Lulu.” These painfully ponderous reflections represent the culmination of a major shift for Wainwright. The troubadour has been slowly moving away from the disaffected, dissolute charm of his early efforts, most notably on 2001 breakout album “Poses,” and towards an artistic seriousness that has motivated him to write an opera and compose a score for the Philadelphia Ballet during the last five years. In Wainwright’s recording career, this development has uprooted his lyrical subject matter from the glitzy side streets of Chelsea and launched him into the vague and airy realm of love, loss, and remorse. His musical range has been correspondingly streamlined from the likes of synthesizers, horns, strings, and drums, to a simple piano.
But if “All Days Are Nights” is an unalterable step towards a kind of maturity, it is also a regrettable one. In growing more earnest, some of Wainwright’s compositions have reached a previously unexplored height of emotional and intellectual resonance, an important part of which is Wainwright’s commitment to the piano. More saliently, however, the overwhelming sentimentality of this latest album has blunted the artist’s edge and overshadowed his great musical talent.
“The Dream,” the standout track on “All Days Are Nights,” signifies what potential there is in Wainwright’s new style. Employing an uplifting chord progression in a refreshing major key, Wainwright warbles, “The dream has come and gone / The earth lumbers on / The dream is back in space / Back where it came from.” Striking a fantastic, wistful, and yet powerful tone, Wainwright here describes a kind of loss that avoids the lure of saccharine self-pity. His imagery, of an earth “lumbering on” and of galactic dreams, is sweet and clear without being cloying. After a brief and discordant piano part, Wainwright ends the song by belting, “I truly loved / Which is harder to do, yes it’s harder to do / Yes it’s harder, harder, harder, to do / Than to dream of.” The repetition of the word “harder” is moving, and the softly and slowly spoken phrase “to dream of” terminates the song on an extremely haunting note.
However, nearly the entire rest of the album falls into two unfortunate categories: that of exasperating melancholy and sappy happiness. In “True Loves,” the chief example of the former group, the piano plays in a minor key at an unbearably slow pace. Wainwright’s voice drips with emotion as he intones, “It’s the true loves / That make me want to cry / It’s the true loves / That make me want to say goodbye.” It is entirely unclear what Wainwright is talking about beyond the level of platitudes, and the broader feeling conveyed, that of love’s sadness and longing, is just as bland. Towards the end of the ballad, the piano delves into a cascading and unpleasant series of arpeggios that make little sense with such downhearted lyrics.
The chirpy piano notes and effusively confident narrative of “Give Me What I Want And Give It To Me Now!” offer the same schmaltz in an antipodal key. After accusing an unidentified other of being a “holy cow” and a “greedy sow”, Wainwright exclaims, “I will eat you, your folks, and your kids / For breakfast!” “Sow” and “cow” form a fairly contrived rhyme, and Wainwright is searching too hard for a list of things to eat for breakfast if he has to separate “your folks” and “your kids.” In a broader sense, the childlike fun of this song is pestering, even vapid, whether or not it is intentional.
Wainwright remains an undeniably gifted and intelligent songwriter. “The Dream,” as well as a set of three songs in the middle of the album in which Wainwright sets three Shakespeare sonnets to piano accompaniment, reitreate the creative gifts that the artist has shown throughout his career. Given his past success and glimpses of his continuing talent, then, the main response to “All Days Are Nights” is one of disappointment. Most songs simply don’t live up to Wainwright’s billing. Besides the intellectual clout that makes him great, and the years that have made him alternatively sad and sappy, it may be that he just sounds best when he is having fun.

“My husband,” Christiane Kubrick told The New York Times in 2006, “always had a drawerful of ideas. There were always a lot of stories on the go, things he left started, things he left lying around. It was like being in a waterfall.” Eleven years after Stanley Kubrick’s death, it would appear that the waterfall continues to trickle: Scarlett Johansson and Sam Rockwell have been cast in “Lunatic at Large,” a psychological thriller that Kubrick commissioned in the late 1950s. Although the script lacks a director or a contract with a studio, the attachment of the two actors to the film is strong evidence that it may actually be produced.
It is not enough, apparently, for pop culture to be preoccupied with zombies in films; now we must demand that the movies themselves be sewn together from dead bodies of work and reanimated not by a virus or a spell, but rather the pathogens of greed and commercialism. “Lunatic at Large” provides a reasonably clear-cut case of cinematic tampering, but the arguments against producing “Lunatic” apply to other unfinished works. At the risk of losing the trust of its directors and the respect of its viewers, Hollywood needs to learn to let the dead lie.
To be fair, it is not as if resurrecting unfinished films is a new phenomenon—or one that always results in bad movies. Orson Welles considered the official versions of many of his films to be “unfinished,” and Krzysztof Kieslowski died while his third film cycle was in development. The first two films of the trilogy, “Heaven” and “Hell,” were given to other directors to finish, and while it is problematic to consider them part of Kieslowski’s oeuvre, they are beautiful and engaging in their own right and deserve to be seen.
Lovely though the end result may be, it is difficult to get past the sense of guilt accompanying the release of these undead films. The question transcends aesthetic merit and becomes personal: does a significant contribution to the genre outweigh the ethical concerns of intruding on an artist’s personal work? every artist has the prerogative to decide which ideas to pursue. It’s a right as basic as keeping one’s thoughts to oneself, and to produce someone’s unfinished work feels, at some level, like an extremely personal type of violation.
Creative control over unfinished work is usually given to the artist’s family or friends—as is the case with Kubrick, whose son-in-law, Philip Hobbs, is pursuing the production of “Lunatic.” Though such people seem more likely than others to know the author’s wishes, too frequently they don’t seem to care. Allowing the director’s relatives to make decisions about the cast and crew is a crapshoot in terms of quality. Shared genes do not endow one with any sort of authority about a director’s work. Although Hobbs seems enthusiastic, knowledgeable and well-meaning, allowing him to make decisions about how “Lunatic” will be finished is only slightly better than ceding control to the next person to walk past Kubrick’s old home in Hertfordshire.
“Lunatic” presents another problem typical of unfinished films: it was written 50 years ago. The noir conventions that Kubrick would have played upon seemed trendy and cutting-edge then; to shoot a film like that today is a bold stylistic affectation that would undoubtedly dominate the audience’s attention. Even if the director of “Lunatic” decides to avoid the flashiness of noir cinematography, the piece is still set in 1956, and Hobbs and the production team have decided not to rewrite it. There is no good solution to the dilemma of when to set the film—to rewrite the script would amount to utter stylistic dismemberment, but to film “Lunatic” as a period piece endows it with a very different meaning than it would have had as a contemporary film in 1956. To place the resurrected “Lunatic” in the same category as, for example, a Tarantino film—whose director intentionally sets certain films in the past as a means of exploring certain generic tropes—indicates a troubling lack of comprehension of Kubrick’s place in cinematic history. Such a choice should serve as an ominous harbinger for anyone concerned with the integrity of the director’s work.
If nothing else, the practice of resurrecting films like this poses some interesting theoretical questions about authorship: who deserves credit for a successfully resurrected film like “Heaven?” How can we discuss films like this in terms of artistic intent? But as compelling as unfinished works are as case studies, they often amount to significant violence upon a filmmaker’s oeuvre. Instead of being remembered as prolific, successful, and complete, Kubrick’s career will seem to trail off, leaving behind a collection of troubling uncertainties that will hover over his work long after “Lunatic at Large” has wrapped.

The Apples in Stereo seem to straddle the boundaries between decades, employing vocodered choruses and synthesized beats to emulate bands like 1970s pop giants Electric Light Orchestra. Their seventh studio effort, “Travellers in Space and Time,” travels indeed; it channels 1970s electropop through the filter of the band’s own 1990s heyday. In subject matter, too, the band straddles boundaries, combining frontman Robert Schneider’s love for science and technology with the band’s musical creativity.
Though this could lead to an excess of ideas, “Travellers” is actually surprisingly cohesive; its synthesizer’s creeping presence serves as a sort of glue. For what the album attempts to be—a kind of 1970s throwback—it succeeds. But it lacks climax, both in specific songs and in “Travellers” as a whole. The album’s topography is linear, and when coupled with simplistic, often cheesy lyrics, the effort seems formulaic. The Apples take a 1970s formula and repeat it without adding much, and so their end product is polished but hardly original.
The album begins with “The Code,” a fuzzy and futuristic spoken-word track. Toward its end a melody enters, melting into the album’s first real song, “Dream About the Future.” The track opens with a piano meditation on the same two chords, layered with drums, the band’s characteristic synthesizer, and quirky sound effects. Frontman Schneider soon interjects, “When I tell you that I need you / You don’t believe me.” Achingly whiny and painfully cliché, the vocals slip into high falsettos often distorted by underwater-like effects. Eventually the verse becomes chorus, “What do you see / When you dream about the future? / Do you see me?”
Though these lyrics may be cheesy, they tie to the album’s 15th track, “Wings Away,” in which Schneider sings, “So we open up and scream / Until it all becomes a dream.” In this instance, the lyrical interplay effectively invokes two separate concepts of dreaming. On other tracks, however, lyrical motifs become merely repetitive, most obviously in the dialogue between “C.P.U.,” “Floating in Space,” and “Nobody But You.” All three tracks explore the themes of departure, with the songs containing lyrics like, “You’ve been gone, you’ve been gone / You’ve been away for too long” and “I’ve been gone for too long,” and “You packed your bags and you went away / Searching for the brighter day,” respectively. Whereas the repetition of dreaming helped tie tracks together, this monotonous, clichéd notion of departure only serves to flatten the album, and suggests a lack of inspiration.
Schneider’s interesting musical experimentation, however, sometimes suggests otherwise. “C.P.U.” was written on a non-Pythagorean scale, a musical innovation of Schneider’s based on natural logarithms that creates an interesting, if somewhat jarring, tonality. His innovation demonstrates a level of inspiration and genuine interest that exceeds the repetitive simplicity of much of the album. Other isolated moments of inspiration, such as the glam-rock riff that opens “Dignified Dignitary,” prove that Apples in Stereo are capable of occasional novelty.
Sadly, even the more original tracks like “C.P.U.” lack structural interest; chorus meets verse meets chorus until the track fades out. “Hey Elevator” is also frustrating, simply repeating the chorus’ two lines at the track’s end, layering one line upon the other without much tonal or vocal variation. One song, however, does break from this monotony. “Dance Floor,” the album’s first single, succeeds in shaping for itself a dramatic arch. About two minutes in, it crescendos, followed by a lull that accentuates this change. The track also boasts an interesting rhythm, one with a sense of momentum brought on by the Apples’ careful use of enjambment: “But my / Body’s still moving,” Schneider sings, “When our / World is so confusing.” “No One in the World” also employs enticing rhythmic and dynamic variation, tricolon decrescendos slipping downward, followed by a tonally heightened resolution with quickened sixteenth notes. But even with these variations, the track’s trajectory remains flat, relying on a repetition of the chorus rather than achieving any kind of climax.
The cuts that make up “Travellers in Space and Time” collectively lack shape; the songs build to nothing, and seem to be electric, synthetic variations on the same retro theme. The lyrics remain blasé, the whine of the vocals can be grating, and though the tracks are often irresistibly catchy, they too seldomnly add anything to the 1970s sound that the Apples wish to emulate. The Apples in Stereo may know their influences, but they struggle to expand upon them.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation last night to formalize a partnership with Office of Career Services to send letters to Harvard Alumni Associations across the country in an effort to identify possible career exploration experiences for students during next year’s January Term.
The letters—which will be signed by UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11—will solicit various internship and shadowing opportunities for undergraduates for next J-Term, and will take into account the results of a survey administered by the UC earlier this month, which aimed to pinpoint career areas students would most enjoy exploring.
The 300 students surveyed expressed interest in a wide variety of fields, ranging from the fine arts to fashion to agriculture, said Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12. According to the poll, the non-profit business sector was the most popular option, comprising 52 percent of student responses.
The for-profit business and law sectors followed in popularity, with 43 percent and 37 percent of votes, respectively.
Ebrahim said the UC will also explore the possibility of locating international opportunities.
The Council will consolidate and list the career exploration experience offerings they receive from Harvard alumni on Crimson Careers, an OCS website.
In the future, the UC plans to create a website that will serve as a single, online hub for undergraduates to access all J-Term offerings, according to UC Secretary Christopher A. Devine ’13.
The site will provide a link to Crimson Careers, in addition to student group programming information.
In addition to the J-Term legislation, the UC passed legislation to reimburse the Student Relations Committee $152.23 that was spent on food and supplies for the two “UC Study Breaks” that debuted in a pilot last week in Adams and Mather Houses.
“I think they were both very successful,” said West Yard representative Ivet A. Bell ’13, who conceived of the idea in March. “It seemed like people really appreciated the [effort].”

The air in the Adams Upper Common Room grew stuffy as more than 50 members of the Harvard community crammed in to attend a discussion on “Scientific and Social Explorations of Bisexuality.”
After an audience member complained about the heat, speaker John R. Sylla ’81, an affiliate of the American Institute of Bisexuality (AIB), said “Yeah, we’ve got some hot people in this room.”
Sylla’s discussion—which was sponsored by the Harvard College Queer Students and Allies, the Trans Task Force, and Girlspot—mainly drew on several scientific and sociological studies to address the question of how to understand bisexuality.
The talk, which was part of Gaypril—a month dedicated to celebrating LGBT awareness—also touched on sexual behavior, experimentation, and attraction as components of sexual identity and orientation.
“There are a lot of different theories bouncing around, from bisexuality doesn’t exist to everyone is somewhere on a spectrum,” said Lucy C. O’Leary ’12, political co-chair of QSA and one of the organizers of the event. “This has a lot of relevance because the straight community and the gay community tend to shun bisexual people, and this scientific perspective can help bridge the gap.”
Sylla expanded on the ostracism of bisexuals by both gay and straight communities, saying that the gay community tends to see bisexuals as undermining the queer community’s struggle for political rights, whereas straight people are often reluctant to question their own sexualities.
But Sylla offered some statistics that challenged the very notions of “gay” and “straight.” According to one New York-focused study that Sylla cited, 71 percent of men who reported having sex exclusively with other men in the past year identify as straight, even though their behavior would be termed gay by most observers.
Sylla said that it was important to note that people tend to identify as gay or straight because of a habit of erasing a “middle area.”
“We shouldn’t have to choose between those two categories,” he said. “It would be nice if there were more honest discussion of the gray areas.”
Audience member Gillian Einstein, a visiting professor from the University of Toronto and editor of the book “Sex and the Brain,” said that society places too much emphasis on sorting people into distinct classifications.
“The big question is why we’re so intent on having these categories,” she said. “Why can’t we just rest with people being what they are?”
Sylla said that his friend and former colleague Fred “Fritz” Klein, a bisexual activist and psychiatrist and founder of the AIB, had an inspiring response to people who came to him exwpressing concern that their feelings or practices were shameful or weird—“That’s wonderful!” Klein would reply.
Sylla encouraged all those in attendance to help any friends dealing with secret desires or fetishes to likewise embrace the “wonder” of arousal.

Oprah Winfrey, the great lunar mother who dictates the tides of daytime television, is stepping down. Not any time soon (the launch of the Oprah Winfrey Network isn’t until September 2011) but nevertheless her departure from syndication is a reality. To mark the occasion, let’s revisit the role of female talk show hosts, and consider why none have yet succeeded on late night television.
Female talk show hosts have traditionally been relegated to daytime, due perhaps to the same mid-century marketing logic that gave us the soap opera: more women are home watching television during the day than are men. Take for instance Ricki Lake, Kathie Lee Gifford, or the Eumenides that populate “The View.” By contrast, the best-known women who work in late night TV are probably the staffers who slept with Dave Letterman.
But it’s not that a woman has never hosted a late-night network talk show: “The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers” aired for less than one year, premiering in the fall of 1986. Since 1983, Rivers had served as Johnny Carson’s permanent guest host, a fairly major coup in and of itself. But when Rivers learned she wasn’t one of the frontrunners under consideration for the “Tonight Show” spot if Carson were to step down, she was furious.
Smelling blood in the water, FOX swept in and offered Rivers her own program. Time-slotted to compete with Carson, it would fail miserably. A woman host, it seems, was interesting only as a novelty.
The current exception is Chelsea Handler, the gleefully foul-mouthed host of E!’s “Chelsea Lately.” A recent glowing New York Times profile of Handler acknowledged that, while the comedienne has made remarkable strides on her talk show, she’s orders of magnitude away from a Lettermanian degree of success. There are a few reasons why.
What does it take to host a late-night talk show? The title of Handler’s Times profile (“I’m Chelsea Handler. And You’re Not.”) is a play on Chevy Chase’s famous “Weekend Update” introduction, but the comparison with “Saturday Night Live” is misleading. A talk show’s standard news-rehashing monologue and various sketches certainly call for traditional comedic chops, but the celebrity interview, a talk show staple—it is, after all, where the titular “talk” comes from—requires a skill set all its own.
On “Chelsea Lately,” Handler is often overtly mean, devoting most of each episode to mocking celebrities, and she also doesn’t do a very good job of concealing her contempt for the people who actually appear on her show. It’s not that her C-list guests don’t deserve it, nor that it isn’t funny. But it represents the limitations of Handler’s draw—someone like Jennifer Aniston wouldn’t deign to waste an evening in an uncomfortable couch in front of an audience of gawking tourists just so that she could be insulted on national television.
The talk show host is asked to fulfill the difficult function of flavor enhancer: he (or she) must make even the most dreadfully boring of guests look good, keeping the interview funny without taking over the spotlight. What brings the job to a complexity far beyond that of daytime interviewers is that the result is expected to be consistently hilarious, not just mildly amusing to a few hundred thousand viewers who haven’t had their coffee yet. This balancing act requires no less than a profound bond with the audience: the host must be eminently likeable.
Most talk show hosts cut their teeth on years of stand-up, so that’s the arena from which a lady-successor will most likely emerge. But as it is, when comedy clubs often adhere to an unspoken “one woman comic a night” rule, the successful comedienne is necessarily a perfect storm: attractive (but not too attractive!) with a masculine (but not too masculine!) sense of humor.
The female comedians who make it big often do so by finding a particular shtick that differentiates them—consider Sarah Silverman’s hyper-vulgarity, Janeane Garofalo’s liberal dissent, or Kathy Griffin’s tabloid trash-talk. These are comics I personally respect and admire, but I don’t think that their brands of comedy have the broad appeal needed to anchor a mainstream network talk show.
I would never suggest that Handler and others like her should compromise their comic sensibilities. While the E! Channel isn’t exactly an oasis in the midst of the vast wasteland, Handler has incredible creative license on “Chelsea Lately,” free from the pressure to entice network-sized audiences.
The remedy to the lack of women on late night is not to breed a zinger-equipped army of comedy androgynes. It is to encourage female comics, and try our hardest to appreciate the quality of their humor free from the context of gender.
As things stand, I wouldn’t be surprised if we put a woman in the White House before we put one behind the “Tonight Show” desk. Nevertheless, my vote is for Betty White, who has only gotten funnier since she briefly hosted an eponymous daytime show in 1954.

Sociology Department Chair Robert J. Sampson and UCLA Sociology Professor Robert D. Mare have begun a study attempting to determine whether mixed-income neighborhoods in Chicago and Los Angeles provide better environments for raising children than neighborhoods that are socio-economically homogeneous.
The study, which draws from previous research taking into account roughly 8,000 residents, is intended to pinpoint specific effects of mixed-income housing, such as a greater number of role models in the immediate community. The researchers said they aim to publish it three years from now.
“Poverty is seen as major risk factor for a number of outcomes on adolescents,” Sampson said. “This has led to major policy changes in the United States and a new set of academic studies to try to understand it.”
According to Sampson, the study focuses on the impact that mixed-income neighborhoods have on residents’ “physical and mental health.”
Early returns seem to imply that  mixed-income communities provide improved quality-of-life, Sampson said, which he said was “not surprising.”
Benefits ranged from better mental health to improved racial heterogeneity.
This type of diversification is sometimes buffered by institutional presence, added Sampson, who specifically cited the University of Chicago’s outreach efforts to the community of Hyde Park in facilitating greater income diversification.
Additionally, Sampson said that municipalities and institutions might spur families living in low-income areas to leave their socio-economically homogeneous community by either physically destroy the existing facilities or provide vouchers to incentivize their relocation.
Mare said that the researchers hope that, by choosing two cities that are almost completely different from one another, they produce findings will be highly generalizable.
Mare also stressed the issue of stability, saying that while the benefits of mixed-income environments add greatly to the quality of life these communities, the study also hopes to determine whether these positive outcomes are sustainable.

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili painted a picture of Georgia’s economic and political liberalization in the past five years last night during a talk at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.
“There is no way back to the Soviet Union,” Saakahsvili said, adding that Georgia has instead embarked on a transformative journey by embracing democratic reforms and economic openness. “There is no way out other than total social transformation and integration into Western society.”
In his address entitled “Georgia and Black Sea Security,” Saakashvili expanded the concept of national security to incorporate the relationship between security, democracy, and legal systems. Though he touched on the issue of Georgia-Russia relations in light of the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, he said that military strength alone would not ensure security for his country.
“Security cannot be separated from democracy,” Saakashvili said. “There is no true security where you cannot rely on the rule of law.” He continued, “Having good elections, and enhancing democratic elections...[is] what makes Georgia more secure.”
Saakashvili also drew a contrast between Georgia’s dramatic economic reform in recent years with the policies of the past. He emphasized fiscal restraint, the importance of soliciting foreign investment, and the reduced role of the government as significant changes to the Georgian economy.
Current policies include the requirement that public spending not exceed 30 percent of gross domestic product and that new taxes be approved by a referendum. Saakashvili also noted that Georgia is ranked 11th in the world by the World Bank for ease of doing business.
“Governments are not smarter than markets,” Saakashvili said. “Our experience has been that with less intervention in the economy, there has been more energy.”
Georgia is now taking a path radically different from that of its past, Saakashvili said at the end of his address. “We are speaking about a long process,” the president said, “but our people will not accept regression.”
Students who attended the speech said they were surprised and impressed by Georgia’s commitment to modernization.
Elliot M. Shaw, a student at the Kennedy School, said he had previously been unaware of the opportunities for economic development in the country.
“It will be interesting to see if this development will translate to other nations in the region,” Shaw said.
Dennis M. Mwaura ’12, who also attended the speech, praised Saakashvili’s efforts to strengthen democratic institutions in Georgia, particularly the fact that Georgia currently ranks first in the world in combating corruption.
“It was clear that the president was really committed to democracy from his speech,” Mwaura said.

For many students, the thought of going to section as opposed to enjoying the increasingly warm weather is enough to make them cringe. The prospect of attending a section in which the Teaching Fellow has an accent so pronounced that it is challenging to understand even the simplest phrases is even more unappealing. Even when the problem is not the language itself, many foreign TFs have trouble understanding things like extracurricular commitments and why students occasionally eat in class.
It is unfortunate that students have to worry about communication barriers when they are already struggling to learn and understand the course material. This problem has become a growing issue at Harvard and seems to especially affect students taking courses in math and the sciences, where classes are often large and English is not necessarily internal to the subject matter. In an attempt to remedy this problem, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning launched a pilot class in which TFs who are not native English speakers could learn skills to break the cultural and communication barriers in the classroom and, after its initial success, extended the program past its pilot period. Though this is a step in the right direction, Harvard should take further action to ensure that all TFs are proficient in written and spoken English language and American culture.
Undoubtedly, each employed TF has many years of expertise in his or her field and has much to offer Harvard students. It is thus extremely unfortunate that both the students’ and the TF’s classroom experiences are marred simply by a lack of communication. Though we often complain about what a frustrating experience this can be for students, the inability to communicate is often equally frustrating for the TF. The program at the Bok Center helps TFs develop oral communication skills and recognizes that communication barriers do not necessarily stem from a lack of understanding English. In fact, the course offered does not hone skills in English grammar, but rather teaches foreign TFs about American culture in hopes of tearing down some of the cultural barriers and thus making communication easier. Though the program is promising, it is also extremely limited—only 16 out of 40 foreign TFs who applied for the class were accepted. More needs to be done to ensure that all TFs are able to effectively communicate with their students.
Harvard already tests all future TFs for proficiency in English. Now, however, those who do not meet the standards should be mandated to enroll in an English culture and language class. Many foreign TFs are probably aware of the communication barrier between students and themselves, and participation in such training would be a way to proactively overcome certain qualms about teaching in an unfamiliar language.
An English proficiency requirement might leave some departments lacking TFs, but there should be a stream of potential TFs who are willing to take the course as a prerequisite to their teaching positions, thus lessening the chances of a TF shortage. Perhaps previous graduate students who were discouraged by the prospect of teaching a class without a solid grasp of the English language and American culture would be more likely to apply to be a TF, knowing they would receive support and training from such a class.
These procedures are by no means a judgment of the value of a non-native, English-speaking TF in the classroom. In fact, we are extremely fortunate to have these TFs contributing to our education. They are simply thwarted by a communication problem for which there is a potential remedy. If measures are implemented to ensure all TFs have a thorough understanding of how to teach American students before entering the classroom, there will be more learned and less lost in translation.

Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot may have set a new men’s course record—2:05:52—during yesterday’s Boston Marathon, but a handful of Harvard students ran the race with a different goal in mind—raising funds for charity.
For Samuel B. Novey ’11, yesterday’s race was the culmination of months of preparation and fundraising. In hopes of raising money for Citizen Schools, an organization that fosters after-school programs for low-income students, Novey took on the persona of “Burgerman” and ran the 26.2 mile race in a burger suit, complete with lettuce, onions, and tomato. In the weeks leading up to the marathon, Novey organized weekly group runs in hopes of getting the community involved in his plan.
“Burgerman was a way to tell a story,” said Novey, who finished the marathon in a little over 4 hours. “How I was tapping into my passion for burgers to help education quickly became a story for all of us of how we as citizens can all tap into our resources.”
In the end, Novey and his two fry-costumed companions—who ran as “bandits,” meaning they lacked official numbers—amassed $13,643 in donations for Citizen Schools—significantly shy of his $100,000 goal.
Kellie E. O’Toole ’11 and Benjamin A. Pinkas ’11 were two of the 239 runners to undertake the race as part of the American Liver Foundation’s Run for Research team.
“It was very difficult, but totally worth it when you see all those people in liver-orange out there on the course,” O’Toole said. “It was really powerful giving all your energy in one day for a cause, running for people who are giving it their all every day.”
Pinkas said the marathon—his first—was “an incredible experience.”
“The fans along the way were more than I could ever ask for, especially around the colleges,” he said. “There was this spirit that really lifts you...you go and high five them, and just that touch gets you going.”
The American Liver Foundation began the practice of raising money for charity through volunteer Boston Marathon runners in 1989. This year, the Boston Athletic Association allocated 1,350 marathon numbers for people running in support of charity.
In addition to those participating in support of outside organizations, 10 Harvard undergraduates ran as part of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge, which raises funds for the Phillips Brooks House Association.
Kelly A. Evans ’10 was among the HCMC runners to participate in this year’s marathon.
“It’s a long road of fundraising, of training,” Evans said, “but it’s just so much fun when you get there and realize how much you’ve accomplished.”

CORRECTIONS: April 20, 2010
An earlier version of the Apr. 20 news article "Students Run Marathon to Raise Money for Charity" incorrectly stated that Rober Kiprono Cheruiyot ran the Boston Marathon in 2:05:51. The correct time is 2:05.52.
The article also stated that Harvard College Marathon Challenge raises funds for the Phillips Brooks House Association and Project HEALTH. In fact, HCMC does not raise money for Project HEALTH, and all money goes to PBHA.

The College’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response will officially offer its services to the entire University starting in the fall, according to OSAPR Director Sarah Rankin.
OSAPR—which has been primarily College-funded since its inception in 2003—will be partially funded by the student health service fees from students across the University next fall.
The College will continue to provide additional funding for OSAPR’s prevention and awareness programs, according to Jeff Neal, a spokesman for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Rankin called the change a “step in the right direction.” About a quarter of the students the office currently counsels attend Harvard’s graduate and professional schools, according to Rankin.
“It really legitimizes our work with the graduate students,” she said.
The change will significantly increase the scope of the office.
“Essentially, we are going from serving 6,500 [students] to 20,000,” Rankin said.
Despite the increased demand, Rankin said that OSAPR does not plan on hiring any new staff, though she said the Office’s educational specialist may have to deal with a larger percentage of victim services cases.
As part of the FAS budget cuts, which began nearly two years ago, OSAPR’s budget was cut 25 percent, according to Rankin. Additionally, OSAPR was closed last July, something which had not occurred in years past, and which sparked controversy across campus.
Going forward, the University plans on maintaining the Office’s services throughout the year, according to Neal.
Rankin said she does not believe the Office’s increased responsibilities will diminish the quality of OSAPR’s services to undergraduates.
“I think that the majority of our cases will always be College students,” Rankin said. “We have the closest relationship with the College.”
Aside from officially expanding their 24-hour victim counseling services across the University, Rankin said she also plans on working to better promote existing resources outside the College. For example, the Office plans to more widely publicize In Common, a peer counseling hotline for Harvard’s graduate and professional schools.
Rankin said she is looking forward to the opportunity to work with schools across the University in an effort to improve and update their sexual assault policies, which, she added, can vary greatly. Some of the University’s professional schools’ sexual assault policies are less comprehensive than the College’s, Rankin said.
“Unlike the College, some of the professional schools haven’t handled a student to student sexual misconduct case in years. One benefit to the expansion of services is that OSAPR can offer assistance in updating policies or procedures that may need to be reviewed,” Rankin said.

Patrick F. Fagan, director of the Center for Research on Marriage and Religion, described how stable marriages and families benefit society at a discussion hosted by True Love Revolution, a student advocacy group that promotes premarital abstinence.
In his three-part lecture “Will You Marry Me? Restoring a Culture of Marriage,” Fagan used data from national surveys conducted between 2000 and 2008 to demonstrate the relationships between marriage and different societal institutions including government, education, religion, and the economy. He said that strong married couples produced more stable families and children.
“Kids thrive when Mom and Dad are happy,” Fagan said, arguing that children raised by married couples are better prepared to succeed in society outside their families.
According to the data Fagan presented, which included analyses of differences between racial and socioeconomic groups, children from intact families have higher GPAs and are less likely to be incarcerated. Additionally, Fagan compared the impact of a divorce on a household’s financial situation with the impact of the Great Depression on the U.S. economy.
Fagan cited national trends that show decreasing sexual activity among young people, which he said gave reason for optimism. He expressed support for groups like True Love Revolution and encouraged them to frame the debate and use social science resources at Harvard to acquire data to advance their arguments.
“There is a change taking place and it’s going in the right direction,” he said.
During the question and answer session after the lecture, a number of audience members asked Fagan to elaborate on his views about homosexuality, but he declined to do so, saying that he was only referring to heterosexual relationships during the lecture.
Some audience members said they felt that Fagan had omitted important issues related to family stability. “I think the biggest thing is he didn’t address [social] class,” Natalia M. Renta ’11 said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than a week after Computer Science 50 Lecturer David J. Malan ’99 announced in an e-mail to his course staff that the introductory coding class would switch to a satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system, administrators within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and CS50 teaching fellows have expressed reservations about Malan’s plan—which might delay the grading change until the fall of 2011.
The proposal has prompted hesitation among some SEAS faculty and course TFs due to concerns that the new grading scheme may be incompatible with course credit policies and may weaken the academic rigor of the class, which drew more than 300 students when it was offered last fall.
“It’s not clear to me whether the good things outweigh the bad things,” said SEAS Dean Cherry A. Murray. “I have a feeling it won’t be a done deal for next year.”
She added that there had been a flurry of e-mails sent among SEAS faculty over the weekend, and that several professors had expressed concerns about the changes in the grading scheme.
SEAS Associate Dean for Academic Programs Robert D. Howe stressed that some professors were especially concerned that students concentrating in engineering or applied mathematics typically take CS50 for concentration credit. In order for the course to count for an engineering or applied math requirement, it must be taken for a grade, which would potentially force these students to be among a small minority of graded students in a primarily sat/unsat class.
Murray said that final decision will be put to a faculty vote sometime in mid-May,
Associate Professor of Computer Science Matt D. Welsh addressed the issue of changing the grading scheme of CS50 in a blog post published yesterday. Though he noted that the post “represents [his] own thoughts on the matter, not the CS faculty as a whole,” Welsh wrote that he “question[s] the need to change the grading option for CS50, which potentially creates more problems than it solves.”
The response from the CS50 grading staff was also not immediately clear.
Six teaching fellows contacted for this article declined to speak on the record, with several citing an e-mail from A. Cansu Aydede ’11, the head TF for CS50, asking all inquiries to be directed to herself and Malan. Malan declined to comment until final decisions have been made.
Aydede said she had spoken to Malan about the plan before it was announced last Friday, and that she believes it will ultimately create a more accessible class with a broader appeal for Harvard students.
“I think it will actually encourage people to focus more on the CS part and less so on grades,” Aydede said, adding that she had spoken to several friends who have expressed greater interest in the class since hearing it would be graded sat/unsat.
But one CS50 TF, who wished to remain anonymous in order to preserve his relationship with the course staff, said that while he believes “the motivation behind [the change] is good,” he strongly disagrees with altering the CS50 grading scheme.
“Having seen the grading standards, you don’t really have to do much to get a C-,” the student said, referencing the lowest grade possible to earn a satisfactory score. “I think a lot of the people in the class will wind up learning nothing or nearly nothing.”
The student also said that his views were not unique among current and former CS50 TFs, noting that several other TFs he had spoken to about the possible change also said they were not in favor of it.
Another student, who has worked as a TF for CS50 and also asked for anonymity, said he was cautiously optimistic about the grading change, though he still has many concerns.
“I think it encourages more people to take 50, which is a good thing,” the student said.
But he added that the changes to the grading scheme will make many “skeptical as to whether [CS50 is] a serious course anymore.”
Yet among prospective students, many of whom were under the impression that the course would definitely be offered sat/unsat in the fall, reactions toward the potential change seemed to be mostly positive.
Vinay A. Trivedi ’13, who said he is considering concentrating in economics or philosophy, said that he was initially excited when he heard about the grading change, because it meant he would be able to take the class without having to worry about it significantly increasing the difficulty of his course load.
Knowing that the grading change is uncertain, however, Trivedi said, “It definitely makes me question whether I will take the class or not.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Corruption has long been the dead weight stymieing the economies of many developing nations. However, a new economic program in India, sponsored by the good-governance group, 5th Pillar, offers an innovative new way of fighting this scourge—through individual acts of resistance. 5th Pillar is creating and distributing “zero-rupee notes” to citizens across India; when asked for a bribe, individuals hand over a zero-rupee note instead. This efficient and cheap initiative has already met considerable success in fighting bribery. Further anti-corruption efforts in the developing world should emulate the zero-rupee note’s strategy of addressing the social norms underlying corruption; such efforts will be more effective than initiatives that have aimed to combat corruption through structural adjustments.
Numerous studies have found a strong correlation between high corruption and lower economic growth, as corruption creates an invisible tax on all economic activity. It hurts trade, investment, the effectiveness of government expenditure, and, critically for developing countries, the prospects of innovation. This problem is very salient in India today; the 2009 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranks India as a dismal 84th, a distressing result for the world’s second-fastest growing economy.
The zero-rupee note attacks this social problem through social, rather than political, means. Various news sources have reported that officials are often shocked and shamed when given the note and quickly perform the necessary service without a bribe. One man who was overcharged for a car-parking fine, Ashok Jain of Chennai, immediately shamed the attending policemen into charging him the correct fee by handing them a zero rupee note, and an old lady who had been fighting for a land title for years gave the note to a local official and finally received the document after over a year of delays.
Thus, a project that initially began in 2007 with the distribution of 25,000 notes in the southern state of Tamil Nadu “met with such high demand” that 5th Pillar has now given out close to one million notes and is expanding the program from its initial starting locale in southern India.
The zero-rupee note program works because corruption is often a product of social norms. As development efforts go forward, such efforts to change social norms should be emphasized above ineffective structural reforms that paper over persisting problems. India has had legal structures meant to fight corruption since the country’s inception, but in the words of Kennedy School professor Lant Pritchett, “the de jure process no longer has any real claim on the behavior of the agents of the state, who are following a different de facto set of procedures” that have basically institutionalized corruption. Even new elected officials or new laws will not change the expectation that a bribe needs to be paid to get something done.
Additionally, the World Bank has emphasized that “social norms transformation is the key to fighting petty corruption.” To really change the way the system works, countries need to change the attitude that corruption is an expected feature of interaction with government. And as a recent Boston Globe story notes, game theory models have shown that it only takes a few actors demanding honesty to fundamentally change a corrupt system.
The small, symbolic act of refusing to bribe in the same manner as thousands of other people has emboldened many individuals in India and thus anti-corruption advocates throughout the developing world. Whether taking the form of a zero-currency note or uniforms without bribe-holding pockets, innovative measures to reduce corruption can remove some of the final shackles that are holding back the growth of developing countries. As the zero-rupee note program shows, a devoted group of individuals with creative ideas does not need a large budget or major political supporters to change the economic culture of a country.

Have you heard the one about the priest and the choirboy?
Ministerial jokes have been given a fresh wave of ammunition this month, as sexual abuse scandal followed sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church. Not only has the number of abuses shocked the world, but the pope himself has also been labelled culpable for his failure to defrock abusers and his implicit allowance (while presiding archbishop of the Vatican’s doctrinal office) of a known pedophile resuming parish duties. However, as all decry papal justice, the question remains: Why did national, legal, and administrative authorities let such affairs occur in their own country? The Vatican is, in some respects, considered a state, and should fully control and take responsibility for its own actions. But it doesn’t bear the same blunt repercussions as Western states, and the inadequacies in its legal system are offensive to advanced nations. The trust and deference awarded to the structure of the Roman Catholic Church would not be applied to any other religious institution, and in a world of national responsibility, it is frankly unjust. Respect for the Roman Catholic Church and the Vatican should be upheld; however, it is only fair that national law oversees and influences practice within canon law.
The recent reports have revealed a wave of sexual abuse instances, condemned the head of the Irish Church for being part of an investigation that forced two children to sign secrecy oaths, and shown the pope himself to be excessively lenient in punishing sex offenders. A letter was revealed that showed the pope refused to defrock a Catholic priest who molested children for “the good of the universal church.” Furthermore, reports have shown that while archbishop of Munich, the pope approved a pedophilic priest to undergo therapy, and, despite warnings from a therapist, the priest was later allowed to return to parish duties, whereupon he continued to molest children. Whether or not the pope knew about the priest’s re-instatement is somewhat irrelevant, as the ruling happened under his watch. Before 2001, there was no set system for handling sexual abuse cases, which were only ever addressed at a diocesan level. But even though 60 percent of cases after 2001 were dealt with by administrative action rather than long, drawn out court cases, there is clearly no set system of accountability and punishment. Furthermore, the reports in Ireland showed that the Church failed to report the offenses to local authorities, thus preventing any external punishment.
In the wake of these findings, outspoken atheist Richard Dawkins has suggested that the pope should stand trial. Such a notion is simplistic, inappropriate, and, at any rate, impossible, due to the pope’s criminal and civil immunity as head of a state. Nevertheless, Dawkin’s proposition raises the interesting question about national reactions to canon law failings. Why should there not be a greater emphasis on national legal systems when it comes to issues that affect citizens outside the church? And why shouldn’t there be legal retributions on a national level against those who made serious errors in allowing pedophiles to work with children?
In some regards, the Vatican is treated as a country in its own right, and so its legal affairs are treated as an internal matter. However, this skirts the fact that the Vatican doesn’t function like a normal country—its leadership holds authority within the legal fabric of other nations. Thus, the matters dealt with by canon law are still under the jurisdiction of other national legal systems. Furthermore, the Church doesn’t have the same in-built assurances of responsibility and retribution as most Western nations. Democracies ensure a degree of dependence on the public, so no political figure would be able to get away with the acts that the church community has without having to resign. Not only does the Catholic Church escape this guaranteed reliance on public support, but it also avoids surveillance from a higher power. No school education system or other intuition would be allowed to conduct its inner procedures and administration in the way the Church has done and not face a reaction from a government body. Thus, the Church seems to avoid serious consequences and retribution.
The pope is right in noting that the Church is a community with justified concern for its public appearance, and it’s undeniable that the Vatican deserves respect and thus, its institution and church-related dealings should remain internal. However, it is a commonly upheld Western belief that, regardless of religion, citizens should adhere to the law of the land. One could never imagine such lenience being applied to the inner workings of a Muslim body. The deference to canon law is excessive, and national legal systems should place limits on the Church’s power. Governments should be allowed to decree the fate of pedophilic priests in their own countries, and, if the Church does not grant them this right, there should be legal punishment for those who hid the crime. Perhaps to arrest the pope is a step too far, but the Roman Catholic Church should know that its jurisdiction does not supersede that of national justice systems.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Wednesday marked a strange assemblage of anniversaries: the 145th of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination, the 98th of the Titanic’s iceberg collision, and the 71st of John Steinbeck’s magnum opus, “Grapes of Wrath.” Among these decaying men and doomed machines stood Simone de Beauvoir, her death one year shy of its quarter-century mark. Although Lincoln gave us “four score and forty years,” the Titanic spawned an eponymous Hollywood blockbuster, and Steinbeck became the bane of freshman reading lists, Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” posed the seminal question, “What is a woman?”
The answer, readers soon learn, is not as forthcoming as it initially seems, while recourse to the dictionary provides little illumination: Although certainly an improvement on “the rib of Adam,” Webster’s “adult female person” remains frustratingly nondescript.
Beauvoir, for her part, took on the question by denying its validity. Rejecting essentialist explanations for the female condition, Beauvoir famously declared, “one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.” The “eternal feminine”—those behaviors and character traits that set women apart from men—were humanly created, Beauvoir argued, not natural. Rather than evidencing a perverted female essence or mistaken choice, feminine traits reflected woman’s situation. For Beauvoir, women’s biological nature could never be experienced apart from this second social nature: The body, and with it, body-consciousness, were always historically mediated.
“Woman, like man, is her body,” Beauvoir wrote, “but her body is something other than herself.” Although masculinity coincided with the for-itself—that freedom which makes one uniquely human—femininity coincided with the in-itself—the inhuman or object-like. Man encountered the body as pure instrument, able to be dominated and controlled; woman, by contrast, experienced her body as an inscrutable burden. Biological givens may have had no meaning outside that which society conferred on them, but they still had an objective reality: In Beauvoir’s understanding, they placed real constraints on the projects that women could undertake. Enmeshed in the reproduction of the species, woman’s life was inherently directed toward means—producing and caring for other beings—rather than ends—those concrete projects that would enable her to realize her full human potential.
Beauvoir thus found herself caught between asserting and denying difference. Pushing too far toward the former, she risked reifying false understandings of “female nature”; turning toward the latter, she risked refuting the very distinctions that make men men and women women. To be sure, Beauvoir unequivocally rejected the notion of equality in difference, which, in her mind, spelled inferiority. Yet, as per her claims, since the essence traditionally assigned to women was unacceptable and no new essence loomed on the horizon, women’s only chance at liberation lay in emulating men. Beauvoir’s woman, it seemed, was really just a man in drag—or, worse yet, a eunuch.
Critics latched onto this ambiguity and lambasted “The Second Sex” for ascribing to a masculinist paradigm. By trivializing women’s reproductive labor, the argument went, Beauvoir reinscribed the gendered binaries which she purported to deny, conflating culture with man and nature with woman. In this view, Beauvoir figured liberation as a masculine concept—as the ability to transcend the limitations of the traditionally feminine. The model of liberation that she offered woman, therein, seemed no different from the existing paradigm proffered by men.
More than 60 years later, Beauvoir’s text continues to invite more questions than it resolves. Turning the final page, the reader is left wondering: Does sexual difference exist? If so, is it natural or artificial? Should it be exalted or condemned? Must the hierarchy of masculine and feminine be nullified, and, if so, by what paradigm can it be replaced? Is the cultivation of a new model of gender, beyond the binary of male and female, possible? Or can gender only be overcome when female becomes male—when sexual difference ceases to serve as an a priori?
Ultimately, Beauvoir wanted to have it both ways. Rebuffing the idea of a fixed female essence, Beauvoir envisioned a woman who realized herself in economic and social independence. At the same time, she upheld the need for gender difference, however qualified, deriding women who denied their femininity and became no more men than women in the process. Since gender equality entailed neither difference nor imitation, and the biological binary of XX and XY occluded any middle ground, Beauvoir seemed to render all feminist stances equally untenable.
Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” has since succumbed to obsolescence. New paradigms, denying the structuring of sexual difference as a binary opposition, claim to relegate Beauvoir’s text to a realm of secondary importance. Yet, even if Beauvoir never unequivocally answered the question she posed, she provided the terms of a debate which remains intensely contested. As Beauvoir’s tombstone turns 24, her legacy—whether fully or pseudo feminist—commands our continued attention.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the semester nears its final weeks, the workload is beginning to pile up for many Harvard students, and for the Crimson sailing team, life is no different. The squad competed in the busiest weekend of its spring campaign, with five regattas held at various campuses around New England.
The highlight of the weekend for the Crimson was the co-ed team’s sixth-place effort at the New England Dinghy Championships held at Connecticut College.
“Our goal was to sail consistently and conservatively this weekend,” junior skipper Alan Palmer said, “and we were able to do that by not taking too big of risks, helping to ensure all of the little things that could happen out on the water didn’t greatly affect our finish.”
The women’s team sent its top sailors to the Women’s Wick & Shrew Trophies at the US Coast Guard Academy, where the contingent came away with a sixth-place finish. The co-ed squad also had competitors race at the 71st Oberg Trophy hosted by Boston University, where Harvard placed ninth, and the Brandeis Invitational and 46th Gibb Trophy race, both hosted by Tufts.
“We were excited about our results,” said women’s team member Liz Powers. “We competed against most of the top women sailors in the country this weekend and performed well.”
NEW ENGLAND DINGHY CHAMPIONSHIPS
The Crimson entered the New England Dinghy Championships this past weekend needing to place eighth or better as a team in order to advance to the Inter-Collegiate Sailing Association National Semifinals held later this spring. Therefore, that was their primary goal heading into the competition among an 18-team field at Connecticut College, and Harvard met this goal with a sixth-place effort.
“All we wanted to do entering the weekend was to place in the top eight and ensure ourselves a place in the national semifinals,” Palmer said. “However, even though we were able to do that, the weekend was a bit disappointing, as we were in third place after the first day and struggled a bit during the second half of day two on Sunday.”
The second-day struggles were most prominent in the A division for the Crimson, as Palmer and junior crew Meghan Wareham closed out the weekend with four of their worst five performances out of the 17 total races over two days and ended up tied for fifth in their division.
“Our starts kind of fell apart on Sunday,” Palmer said, “and we need to work on refining our fundamentals in boat speed and boat handling the rest of the season.”
Fellow juniors, skipper John Stokes and Quincy Bock, teamed up to finish seventh in the B division in somewhat challenging conditions.
“The winds were pretty shifty out there,” Palmer said, “which was good for us as we practice in that type of wind all the time. There was also a current, which made the course tough to direct at times.”
With the sixth-place effort this weekend, Harvard will head to Seattle on May 1-2 for the National Semifinals.
“We are happy we qualified and will be looking to finish among the top nine at the Semis in order to qualify for Nationals,” Palmer said.
WOMEN’S WICK & SHREW TROPHIES
As the co-ed squad qualified through the New England Championships this past weekend, the women’s team competed in a tune-up race this past Saturday and Sunday in preparation for its regional competition next weekend, placing sixth among a field of 16 at the Women’s Wick & Shrew Trophies, hosted by the Coast Guard.
“We prepare all year for next weekend’s competition,” Powers said, “and this weekend’s results gave us some confidence heading into that regatta.”
A pair of sophomores provided the highlight for the women’s team, as skipper Emily Lambert and crew Alexandra Jumper finished second in the A division.
“Emily and Alex sailed really well,” Powers said. “It was their best score this season and was an impressive finish considering the great field we competed against this weekend.”
Powers was not as excited about her own results in the B division, as she skippered alongside sophomore crew Marie Appel to take home 10th in that division.
“Marie and I were a bit disappointed with the way we closed out the weekend,” the senior said.
71ST OBERG TROPHY
The Crimson finished ninth out of a field of 16 at the 71st Oberg Trophy held at Boston University this past weekend.
Junior skipper Colin Santangelo and freshman crew Alma Lafler finished fifth in the A division, while first-year skipper Jason Michas teamed up with senior crew Alexandra Perkins for six races and sophomore crew William White for two to finish ninth in the B division.
BRANDEIS INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Seniors Alex Bick and Ali Beyer competed for Harvard at the Brandeis Invitational, as the fourth installment of the Central Series of racing this past weekend.
46TH GIBB TROPHY
The Crimson placed seventh out of eight teams at the 46th Gibb Trophy held at Tufts this past weekend. Freshmen Sam Millham and Nick Waldo skippered for Harvard, as sophomore Caroline Lourie and freshman Jin Zang took care of the crewing duties.

Just a day after surrendering 17 runs to Brown, the Harvard pitching staff stepped up its game and allowed only two in a rescheduled doubleheader Monday at O’Donnell Field.
The Crimson (13-20, 6-6 Ivy) returned its conference record to .500 and kept pace with division leader Dartmouth with the two wins over the Bears (11-22, 8-4). Harvard pitchers were the highlight of the afternoon, consistently throwing strikes while effectively keeping Brown runners off of the base paths.
“We needed this sweep, especially after yesterday,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said. “We avoided our nemesis: the base on balls.”
The Harvard bats also came alive for 15 runs after scoring only four during the Bears’ sweep on Sunday.
“We just had everything: good pitching, timely hitting, and solid defense up the middle,” Walsh said.
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Junior Max Perlman and freshman Andrew Ferreira combined to shut out Brown and hold the Bears to five hits in the second game of the twin bill.
Perlman pitched four shutout innings, and gave up four hits and struck out four Brown batters, but was pulled early because the coaching staff had him on a strict pitch count.
Ferreira, who came in from the bullpen to start the fifth, used a sharp curveball to fool the Bears’ hitters, and threw four perfect innings before giving up a single in the ninth. His efforts earned him his first win of the season.
“Some of the guys in the dugout were saying they hadn’t seen a curveball like that since [San Francisco Giants pitcher Barry] Zito, who I had in the Cape League for a couple of years,” Walsh said.
Like the first game, the Crimson offense started up early, scoring two runs in the first inning.  Following a walk to junior Sean O’Hara and a double by junior captain Tyler Albright, junior Sam Franklin singled to right, plating two.
Harvard put three more on the board in the third inning to extend its lead to five.  With a runner on second, Albright hit a single up the middle, scoring O’Hara.  Franklin then singled, plating Albright before reaching home himself on a sacrifice fly by classmate Dillon O’Neill. Franklin led the Crimson hitters with seven RBI’s while hitting 5-8 on the day.
“I thought our hitters were aggressive out there, and then they were taking pitches at the right time,” Walsh said.
Albright hit 3-5 and scored twice while adding on an RBI, and O’Hara scored and walked twice while hitting 1-3.
HARVARD 6, BROWN 2
Franklin singled in two runs in the fifth inning to break a 2-2 tie and give Harvard a lead it would never surrender in the first game of the doubleheader.
“Sam hit the ball well all day,” Walsh said.
Franklin hit 2-4 with 4 RBI’s during the first of the twin bill, and was robbed of a third hit when Brown shortstop Tyler Graham made a leaping catch off of Franklin’s liner to end the sixth inning with the bases loaded.
In addition to his stellar defense, Graham welcomed Crimson sophomore starting pitcher Brent Suter to the mound with a leadoff home run to right field.  The Bears tacked on one more in the first when junior Josh Feit singled through the right side of the infield, but Brown was unable to manage any more runs.
Harvard quickly responded to the Bears’ early lead, scoring two of its own in the home half of the frame.  With runners on first and second, Franklin doubled down the left field line, scoring O’Hara and sophomore Marcus Way for his first two RBI’s of the game.
Suter calmed down after a rough first inning and pitched the complete seven-inning game to earn his second win of the season.
“Brent was throwing strikes,” Albright said.
The sophomore struck out seven and stranded five Brown runners on the bases en route to the victory.
The Crimson added two more for insurance in the sixth with RBI hits by freshman Kyle Larrow and sophomore Jeff Reynolds, stretching the lead to four.

When the pitching is effective enough, you can afford a slow offense.
The Harvard softball team (18-19, 9-3 Ivy) swept its doubleheader at home against Brown (15-18, 3-9) at Soliders Field despite scoring only six runs over the two games. Two strong pitching performances—including a complete game shutout in the second contest—were enough to overcome the shortages at the plate. The doubleheader, a make-up from Saturday’s rainout, followed a two-game split on Sunday when the Crimson managed only five runs.
“Our bats were flat both days,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “We got the hits we needed today.”
HARVARD 2, BROWN 0
Eight days after her no-hitter, sophomore Rachel Brown put together a second strong performance, throwing a complete-game shutout on four hits. She also struck out 14 on 91 pitches.
The bats did not provide much help—the Bears actually outhit a Crimson team that managed only three all game—and junior Ellen Macadam drove in two runs on as many hits for the game’s only offense.
“Ellen is a great hitter,” Brown said. “I’m always so excited when she’s up to bat because she hits it so hard.”
Macadam drove in a run on a one-out single in the third, and added her second RBI of the day with a fifth-inning triple.
But Brown was the story of the day. She struck out two batters in every inning but the fourth and only allowed one runner to reach scoring position.
“I thought [Rachel Brown] was really getting ahead early in the count,” Allard said. “She was really spinning the ball well, and I thought she was staying in her technique, in her zone.”
Brown did not walk any batters in the day’s second game and faced 23 batters, two over the minimum.
“My focus was starting ahead early on the mound and making them swing at pitches when they were behind in the count,” Brown said.
As in the first game, one player accounted for most of the offense. Beyond Macadam, only junior Emily Henderson had a hit—a fifth-inning double. Even with six walks and two Brown errors, Harvard could not effectively drive in runs.
“I think certainly we would have liked to score some more runs, but we did what we needed to do and we strung together the hits,” Brown said.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 2
One swing is sometimes enough.
Sophomore Whitney Shaw hit a three-run home run in the bottom of the first to give the Crimson enough offense to hold on for the win. The long-ball to leftfield was her sixth of the year and came as part of a two-for-three performance in the first game of the afternoon.
Harvard continued its strong pitching from the weekend, allowing no hits after the third inning and never surrendering its lead after the first inning.
Sophomore Julia Moore pitched four innings, allowing two runs and earning the win. Senior Margaux Black pitched three no-hit innings to get the save.
“Margaux and Jules did a great job of shutting them down and making them swing at their pitches,” Brown said. “Brown is not a very aggressive team, so they [were trying] to draw the walks. Margaux and Jules both did a really good job of pitching ahead.”
Black allowed two base runners, one on an error and the second on a seventh-inning walk. She had no strikeouts, but seven of her nine out came by way of the groundout.
“Margaux came in and threw a lot of moving pitches and was very effective for us,” Allard said.
The Crimson had ten hits but still had trouble plating the runners. Other than Shaw, freshman Jessica Ferri was the only other Harvard player to have a hit with a runner in scoring position. Her sixth-inning double pushed the lead to two going into the game’s final inning.
“They were throwing good strike pitches, challenging their batters, and we got some key hits, we got timely hits,” Allard said. “The name of the game is great pitching, good defense, and timely hits.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lavieties Pavilion, Annenberg Hall, and Northwest Science Building are not exactly obvious venues for the blaring music and flashing lights of your average fashion show. The models are not from the pages of Nylon or the set of America’s Next Top Model, but from the room next door and your Wednesday section. Nonetheless Eleganza, Identities and Project East annually take advantage of these spaces for fashion shows to raise funds for charity and alter the perceptions of minority communities on campus.
Operating under the umbrella organization of Black Community and Student Theater (Black C.A.S.T.), Eleganza—which takes place this coming Saturday, April 24—stands as the oldest and most established show at sixteen years old. Recently, two more fashion shows with specific ties to minority communities debuted: Identities and Project East. Under the auspices of the Asian-American Association (AAA), Identities constructed its latest runway and show in Annenberg this past Saturday, presenting its first annual Leadership in the Arts Award to acclaimed Asian-American designer Vera Wang. The more independent Project East put on its most recent show in November 2009 to exhibit the work of exclusively Asian and Asian-American student and professional designers.
Eleganza, Identities, and Project East all participate in worldwide trends of cultural appropriation in couture, but they also redefine the relationship between fashion and the minority community. The particular aesthetic goals of these shows vary based on the nature of their individual relationships with ethnic communities on campus—yet all three remain committed to pursuing charitable ends despite funding complications. The product is a wholly new breed of fashion show.
INTRINSIC TO THE INDUSTRY
A certain degree of cultural hybridization appears inherent in many designers’ projects. Modern fashion has been inextricably tied with appropriation—the browsing of and borrowing from other cultures and time periods. Until recently, this meant mainly European couture houses and designers adopting and tweaking patterns, techniques, and textiles from other regions.
The terms of appropriation have changed and become more varied and complex with globalization, according to Visual and Environmental Studies (VES) Professor Giuliana Bruno, who teaches VES 285x, “Visual Fabrics: Film, Fashion and Material Culture.” One type of appropriation is a sustained dialogue—or positive tension—between different cultures and experiences that creates something new and vibrant. For Bruno, this cultural synthesis is significant because it shows a society’s and an industry’s willingness to come to terms and engage in dialogue with changing times.
Jacqueline M. Boltik ’11, who sits on the board of the Harvard Vestis Council—a student organization devoted to exhibiting Harvard student designs—would agree. Although Vestis itself has no specific ties to minority communities, Boltik can understand the aesthetic sense behind these connections. “Even if you look at major designers and their influences for a certain design or collection, it comes from different cultures and perspectives,” she says. “They’re not necessarily bringing a focus on diversity or minorities, but making use of a practice of the industry. Maybe, the two are even inseparable. In this sense, I think this collaboration between minority groups and fashion is just a natural fit.”
Eleganza, Identities, and Project East engage in the same kind of cultural synthesis on a smaller scale. By interweaving the minority communities and the fashion industry, these three shows disengage the former from its customarily passive role as a source of influence for the latter. They carve a new, active role for their respective communities to influence the perception and message of fashion on campus.
THE MESSAGE SEWN IN
Each show independently seeks to redefine fashion from the Eurocentric and narrow-minded industry that it has been. “When you think of fashion, you think of wealth and skinny white models on a runway. I think fashion can be isolating and not easily relatable for a lot of people,” says Angela Su ’12, one of three executive producers of Eleganza.
In an attempt to include the entire student population, Eleganza itself showcases diversity in both its featured cultural performances and the race, sexuality, and body type of its models. This year the show will open with the Asian-American Dance Troupe and close with a step performance from the Black Men’s Forum and the Association of Black Harvard Women. By uniting various forms of the arts, Eleganza aims to be a dazzling multicultural show rather than a presentation of fashion alone.
Though the event will showcase more couture pieces than in previous years, much of the clothing can be worn on an everyday basis—particularly pieces donated by well-known designers like Nicole Miller—according to Beatrice H.N. El-Hage ’11, the executive producer responsible for fashion.
Carmen V. Feliz-Taveras ’11, another executive producer, says, “I think more people see fashion as a voice for everyone and anyone. It’s something that is tangible. Everyday you can wake up and get dressed, giving yourself a means to express yourself.”
While Eleganza seeks to democratize fashion, Project East tries to maintain and celebrate its elusive haute couture nature. The designers are either high-end stars like Derek Lam and Vera Wang or students at the prestigious art colleges Parsons, The New School for Design, or Rhode Island School of Design. These clothes represent avant-garde thesis projects of student designers and the seasonal collections that debut on fashion capital runways.
“It is more of a platform through which extremely talented individual designers could express themselves than the collective expression of the community,” says Tamara J. Harel-Cohen ’10, a co-producer this year.
Project East turns its sights on another industry stereotype: that Asian designers only make Asian clothing. “This is clearly generalizing and stereotyping, but I feel like when people think of an Asian designer, they assume dragons and kimonos,” says Kristin S. Kim ’09, co-founder. “That’s an inherent quality of Asian cultural fashion, but I think what Project East does is bring forth people who happen to be Asian and who are designers in mainstream America—making clothing not for an Asian audience or trend, but for what is now.” Along the same lines, the other co-founder Timothy M. Parent ’09 says, “everybody has a unique perspective and experience so the community should not be portrayed as this singular homogenous group.”
More subtly, Identities makes the Asian-American experience an undercurrent to multiple segments of the show. The clothes are from a broad spectrum of sources: student designers, local thrift stores, Harvard Square and Boston boutiques, and national brands that are not necessarily connected to the minority community.
On the surface, the two creative directors’ segments of the show—an exploration of the growing phenomenon of androgyny and a fanciful study of the college campus in thirty years—appear similarly detached from cultural roots. “Both have this futuristic theme, but both also look at what it means to be Asian in this structure,” says Nara M. Lee ’11, co-producer of Identities, adding that the directors looked closely at Asian design and fashion history during the creative process.
Though originally conceived as a direct portrayal of Asian-American experience—the first show being partly set in San Francisco’s Chinatown—Identities has developed a different relationship with this community in the past two years. Another creative director Jane Chun ’12, a Crimson magazine comper, says she partly used fashion to respond to the current social, political, and economic climate. “Why do women want to dress this way? Why are certain trends occurring? These greater questions extend from fashion to a much larger stage. Yes, fashion is a reflection of self, but it is also a reflection of the world and our relationship to the world.”
WEAVING A FOUNDATION
Before shows can even try to answer these greater questions, each group must garner attention, secure creative participation and, of course, raise money. The three shows face two main challenges in finding funding on campus: none is a stand-alone organization, and all find themselves unable to apply for Undergraduate Council grants due to their charitable status. These shows thus find themselves obligated to look beyond the obvious sources for financial support.
Within an increasingly crowded and competitive field of student groups, these fashion shows find their affiliations with cultural organizations and institutions a great financial asset. Last fall Project East, committed to remaining an entirely Asian-American and Asian enterprise, was sponsored by the Reischauer Institute, which supports research on Japan, and the Korea Institute. Says Harel-Cohen, “there are these very big student organizations associated with minorities. We were linked to different Asian organizations on campus because they can raise the money. It’s much easier to do it from that framework than to just decide to put on a fashion show.”
Similarly, the Harvard China Winter Service Program is one of a dozen sponsors for Identities this year. “A lot of these places actually sponsor us because we are Asian-American,” says Lee.
By now, Eleganza can lean more on its establishment; it regularly attracts over 1,500 students each year, books stars like Jadakiss and Fabolous, and garners national attention—as the April 2010 issue of Teen Vogue demonstrates. Olamide E. Oladipo, an associate producer for Eleganza who oversees finances, points to their reputation as a draw for potential sponsors. “Companies have either heard of us before when we reached out to them five years ago or have never heard of us before, but trust us and are impressed when they see the long list of our past sponsors.”
Unlike the other two shows, Eleganza does not receive funding through their connection with Black C.A.S.T. “They are our formal umbrella, but we don’t really have financial ties to them,” Oladipo says. Still, Eleganza’s multicultural make-up can still attract sponsors. “For companies that are looking for diversity recruiting, they are really interested in our models so we give them resume books with profiles of all our executives and models,” she adds.
While ties with minority communities can help these shows raise funds, their charitable goals can become ironic obstacles to raising the money that these lavish nights require. The Undergraduate Council (UC) decided recently to make charitable fundraising events ineligible for grants.
With dim prospects for UC funding, these fashion shows turn to outside sources for financial support—sources that find charitable impulses a pull for funding rather than a drawback. “I think when you have an organization that caters to minority or underrepresented students, there’s usually a cause attached. Since they are either donating to charity or helping out underrepresented students, companies are more willing to sign on,” says Farah S. Qadar ’10, the president of the Association of Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs (AMBLE), which recently organized and hosted a conference on the Fashion, Media, and Entertainment Industries. Oladipo also notes the charitable aspect of Eleganza as an advantage in finding funding. “For some, the charity aspect is the reason why they donate to us,” she says.
The profits from Eleganza annually go to the Center for Teen Empowerment, which equips and encourages young adults to enact positive change in their communities in the Boston area. Likewise, this year Identities donated their profits to Artists For Humanity, which seeks to reduce socioeconomic and racial divisions by empowering underprivileged kids with paid employment in the arts in Boston. Project East, however, was the only show of the three to donate directly back to the community which supported them: in 2009, profits went to the China Tomorrow Education Fund to help build a school in rural China.
The charitable impulse itself, however, is derived from a more optimistic sentiment among the boards of these fashion shows; altruism seems to override ineligibility for UC grants. “It’s more than just having a show and ending; we want to make a political statement and demonstrate that we can do good through fashion,” Lee says of Identities.
WRAPPED WITH A BOW
For Parent, who is still very much involved with Project East from his fashion post in Shanghai, the charity status is important for more personal reasons. “It was also a good way for me to give back to [my community] and to help promote my own ethnic group, their talent and credibility, in an industry that doesn’t really appreciate that—or at least didn’t when I started in 2006.”
While Eleganza, Project East and Identities define their relationships with minority communities on unique terms, Parent’s sentiment seems to resonate for all three of these fashion shows. As designers borrow inspiration from respective outside communities to create their clothes for market or school, these three shows return the favor—making use of couture to serve the ethnic communities at Harvard and beyond in both social and charitable ways.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mark of the Gordons on Harvard is hard to ignore. Members of the family invested in the Murr Center, in the outdoor track, and in the soccer program, among other sports. Albert F. Gordon ’59 said he gave around $10,000 for the women’s squash team to take a training and service trip to India in January. The Albert H. Gordon Track and Tennis Center and the Albert H. Gordon Professorship of Business Administration bear the name of his late father, the class of 1923 alumnus and former Crimson editor who ran track and led a stock brokerage firm through the Great Depression.
But the contract non-renewal of squash coach Satinder P. Bajwa left the younger Gordon at a crossroads between his friend and his—and his father’s—alma mater, and the choice he made to stay loyal to Bajwa has put Harvard in a position where it could stand to lose access to thousands of dollars.
Gordon wrote in an e-mail to Director of Athletics Robert L. Scalise on April 14 that he would eschew Harvard athletic events and “not step foot on any Harvard University property on either side of the Charles River” for the next five years.
In an interview Friday evening, Gordon went one step further, saying that he would cease donating to Harvard during that time period.
“If you’ve been around for 50 years and they have their hands out expecting you to be successful, you don’t expect to be stabbed in the back like I have been with Scalise,” Gordon said.
Since 1959, Gordon has donated $5.4 million to Harvard, he wrote in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
If he receives a request for donations in any given year, Gordon said in the Friday interview that he would be comfortable giving $25,000 of his own money. In an e-mail to Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann, Gordon also threatened to withhold an annual 6 percent disbursement of his father’s trust, whose value he said is contingent on the sale of his father’s apartment but could be valued at around $20 million.
John R. Gordon ’71, a brother of Gordon ’59 and executor of the trust, said that a decision has not been made regarding how contributions from that trust would be disbursed. The father of a current Harvard College senior, he described himself as someone who has and will continue to personally be a regular donor to Harvard.
While the extent to which any loss of access to these funds would strain  financial resources is unclear, the already-reduced budget of the Department of Athletics does not stand to gain from divestment. Last May, the athletic department announced plans to close the Malkin Athletic Center over the summer, reduce the travel budgets for teams, and demote the junior varsity baseball, basketball, and ice hockey teams to club sports as part of the $77 million in budget cuts across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
An e-mail sent to Scalise was returned by spokesman Timothy J. Williamson, who wrote in an e-mailed statement that this issue constituted a personnel matter and, therefore, deserved to be treated with respect to employees’ privacy.
“For this reason, it would not be appropriate for us to respond specifically to the issues that Mr. Gordon has raised, nor to the issues others have raised at Mr. Gordon’s request,” he wrote. “Please be assured that all of us at Harvard remain committed to treating all employees, students and student-athletes with fairness and dignity.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a native Masshole, I’ve always known that the third Monday of April brings a state holiday—not the start of school vacation, not Patriots’ Day, but Marathon Monday. I’ve grown up watching the race from both near (the streets of Boston) and far (my television). I know my Heartbreak Hill from my Hopkinton (which, by the way, is a mere four miles from my front door). But after 21 years of watching the marathon, this year, I finally ran (part of) it.
Now, before you get too excited, I did not complete all 26.2 miles of the Boston Marathon yesterday. I somewhat illegally ran a mile and a half with my blockmate Kellie, who was running (the whole) marathon for the second time.
For those of you who have never been to the Boston Marathon, do yourselves a favor and go. Run it, watch it, bring some food and drink and make a day of it, because this is my city at its finest. Thousands of people make the journey from Hopkinton to Copley Square—many to raise money and awareness for charities—and thousands more line the streets, handing out free baked goods and cheering on the runners who have written their names across their singlets.
I hopped onto the race course outside BC just after Heartbreak Hill. Though some runners were understandably fading, others ran past with huge smiles, encouraging the crowd to pump up the volume and proudly displaying their ridiculous costumes (the best one I saw was a rubber ducky, but shout out here to Burgerman). The most entertaining runner of the day was a Korean man who ran alongside the road giving high fives, then stopped abruptly, turned to the girls standing next to me, pulled a camera out of his fanny pack, and asked the girls to take a photo with him. Only in Boston.
As I ran alongside my blockmate, I found myself overwhelmed by the number of people cheering her name, encouraging her to keep up her pace, and congratulating her on her accomplishment. Before today, I hadn’t quite appreciated why she chose to repeat the feat this year after swearing in the days post-marathon last spring that she would never do it again. Now I understand.
I dropped out at Mile 23 and let Kellie finish her amazing race alone—which she did in style, clocking in just under four hours and raising almost $3,500 for liver research.
Did my brief marathon experience inspire me to run Boston in its entirety next year? Perhaps. But at the very least, you can bet I will be skipping class again to go celebrate with my city on my favorite Monday of the year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the winter season ended barely a month ago, spring sports are already beginning to crown their champions, continuing this weekend with the Ivy League Championship for men’s golf.
The tournament is entirely up for grabs. Over the course of the spring, the Ivies have battled one another, and the results have been scrambled from week to week. For its own part, Harvard has shown consistent play, earning top-three finishes in each of its contests this month, but has yet to claim a tournament title.
The Crimson squad is led by sophomore Mark Pollak, whose scoring average this spring of 74.1 is best on the team, as well as sophomore Tony Grillo and senior Greg Shuman, both of whom have averaged 74.7 strokes per round this season.
Captain Danny Mayer and junior Louis Amira round out a top five that believes it can compete for the Ivy title.
Elsewhere in the Ancient Eight, Yale figures to be a contender. The Bulldogs pulled out two-straight wins at the beginning of April before stumbling to fifth this past weekend at the Caves Valley Invitational. Penn and Princeton also are expected to compete for the top spot, as both teams dominated the Caves Valley field last weekend, with the Quakers ultimately prevailing by five strokes.
The Ivy League Championship will take place over three days at the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J. The prestigious par-72 course played host to the 2005 PGA Championship at which Phil Mickelson won his second major, and it was awarded the PGA Championship for 2016.

Where is a good Italian place nearby besides Bertucci's?
I once had the worst meal of my life at Bertucci's. It involved a tiny, desiccated chicken breast perched atop a flat sea of finely chopped iceberg lettuce that looked more like sawdust than salad.
But I digress. Anyway, I guess by "nearby" you don't mean the North End, where you can definitely find some great Italian places. If you're willing to spend some extra cash, Rialto in the Charles Hotel cooks up some lovely Italian food—although its style is a bit different from Bertucci's. And it's actually surprisingly affordable if you sit at the bar and order from their lower-priced menu featuring pizzas ($12), penne bolognese ($14), and sparkly little bites like fried olives ($4). On Mondays, drop by for $1 oysters (although not too late, one time I came and they were all out).
Alternatively, Dave's Fresh Pasta in Davis Square has drawn rave reviews for its freshly prepared pasta, ravioli, and sauces. Or if you’re looking for somewhere a bit closer to home, Basta Pasta in Central Square is a local favorite, known for its large portions and lovingly crafted sauces, particularly its bolognese.
