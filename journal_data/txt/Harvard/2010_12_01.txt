After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard President Drew G. Faust made waves last week when she stated that Harvard will officially recognize the Reserve Officers Training Corps upon the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—the policy that bans openly gay and lesbian Americans from serving in the United States military. Many objectors to the inclusion of ROTC on campus emphasize the shortcomings of the American military beyond DADT, such as its legacy of human rights violations. However, Harvard students are often encouraged to enter industries that they find flawed and to work within these fields in order to change them, and the military should be no different. As such, if the October injunction of the federal judge who ruled against DADT is not appealed by the U.S. Department of Justice—meaning openly gay soldiers could permanently serve in the military—Faust should follow through on her plans and recognize ROTC.
Those who assert that Harvard should not permit ROTC on campus frequently contend that recognizing it would mean endorsing an institution that engages in condemnable activities. These individuals believe Harvard should not recognize the military because it commits breaches of human rights and engages in wars with which they disagree. This claim, however, better reflects the attitudes of Harvard students who were here when Harvard’s ban initially began than the general outlook of students who are here today. The ban of ROTC in 1969 was a byproduct of the pervasive anti-war and anti-military sentiments among students on campus at the time. As Faust stated last week, she has upheld the ban because of the military’s discriminatory practices toward homosexuals, not because of anti-war or anti-military feelings on campus. To continue to ban ROTC based upon the perspectives that were prevalent during the Vietnam War would exclude ROTC because of the feelings of students who are no longer at Harvard.
Harvard and the Undergraduate Council recognize student groups and other organizations that are inclusive; if DADT is repealed, ROTC will fall into such a category and should be able to reap the benefits of Harvard recognition. Many Harvard students may find military service to be an important means of participating in public service, and having ROTC at Harvard would increase opportunities for those students who choose to join to give back to their country. As Faust has stated, all American students ought to have the option to do so.
Whether the military establishes a ROTC chapter on campus is out of Harvard’s hands, although Harvard should do everything it can to encourage that such a chapter flourishes, if one is ever reinstated. If the military stays, and permanently becomes more open, then the onus will be on Harvard to open itself up to ROTC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the recent debate over America’s mounting debt, you may have heard some ominous facts about Social Security. In particular, you might have heard that this year, Social Security payments exceeded revenues for the first time—an ominous milestone that was predicted to occur at least half a decade from now (until the recent recession). This development has provoked general anxiety about Social Security, and rightwing pundits have seized this event to renew calls to cut or even privatize Social Security.
Fortunately, there’s not much to worry about. That may be an unusual thesis for a political opinion piece, a genre rife with alarmism, but it’s an important point to make in a political climate plagued by fear of debt.
The reason there’s little to fear is that the Social Security program has faced tough times before. The last time it did so—in the 1980s—it was only months away from genuine insolvency. As a part of the reform package adopted then, the Social Security Trust Fund was developed to begin to save for the eventual retirement of the baby boomer generation. When payroll taxes exceed Social Security payouts, the remainder is invested in nontransferable U.S. government bonds. The Trust Fund currently has a balance of about $2.5 trillion. Even though the 2010 payouts were projected to exceed revenues by about $29 billion dollars, the Trust Fund will grow rather than shrink. The interest it earns is currently greater than the gap between revenues and spending. Of course, that situation will not last indefinitely. As baby boomers continue to retire, payments will grow and receipts will shrink, and soon enough the Trust Fund will begin to shrink with them.
But despite all of the hype, that’s nothing to be afraid of. The baby boom generation is unusually large. In its most productive days, its payroll tax revenues swamped the cost of previous generation’s retirements. When the baby boomers retire, they’ll take in larger pension funds than subsequent generations can pay. That’s the whole purpose of the trust fund: to save money in preparation for this demographic wave. And no wave, demographic or otherwise, can last forever. By 2029 the average person born in the first baby boom year, 1945, will have died. By 2047 the same will be true of those born in the final boom year, 1964. And these deaths, tragic and difficult though they will be for America’s families, will reduce the burden on Social Security. The tremendous retired population of boomers is a temporary demographic change, not a permanent one. The more general long-term shift in ages, as life expectancies rise due to medical improvements, can be dealt with using very gradual adjustments to the retirement age or payroll tax rate.
The strain on the Social Security system is not destined to increase forever. Furthermore, the idea that the Trust Fund shouldn’t be drawn down is a ridiculous one. The Trust Fund, right now, is the boomers’ retirement fund. When you retire, you spend out of your retirement fund. That’s why it exists. The idea that the baby boom generation should make it through retirement without drawing down their Social Security retirement fund is ridiculous. True, it’s possible that, if the economy doesn’t perform well and the boomers are surprisingly long-lived, the Trust Fund could be completely depleted in 25 years. But the economy tends to over-perform the official Social Security predictions, and the program has been saved with only months to spare before. The current projected day of reckoning is a full quarter century in the future.
Despite any alarmism out there, then, Social Security is one of the most stable and secure government programs out there. Proposals to reform the program to deal with the overall debt problem are misguided at best and disingenuous at worst. America has spent the past two and a half decades building up a Social Security surplus to handle the upcoming strain of the boomers, even as the rest of the government has deficit-spent at an unprecedented peacetime rate. If we want to get a handle on America’s growing debt, Social Security cuts should be the last item on our agenda, not the first.

For decades, the University has served as a hub for researchers breaking each next barrier in science. But because of ballooning federal budget deficits and Republican control of the House, the grant money that Harvard’s research initiatives receive from the federal government  may decline. As reported last week, the University intends to compensate for the loss in government funds by forming more partnerships with private corporations. However, Harvard should not rely on the private sector to fund scientific research because financial dependence on private companies creates an unequal partnership, one that risks compromising the integrity of University research.
Research partnerships between universities and private-sector entities can be unethical; these partnerships entail a delicate balance between two parties with very different interests. Academic research facilitates free intellectual inquiry for the scholarly purpose of advancing knowledge. In contrast, research sponsored by pharmaceuticals or other corporations is more focused and ultimately directed toward the goal of creating products that can be patented for commercial profit. Funding the type of broad, exploratory research unique to a university setting is not economically practical for private companies unless a particular research project has the potential to bring commercial gain.
The University’s chief technology development officer, Isaac T. Kohlberg, told The Crimson that companies that provide funds will not direct or interfere with research. However, as exemplified by the case of the established collaboration with the international pharmaceutical Sanofi-Aventis, private sponsors will at least procure the right to utilize Harvard’s scientific findings for the development of new drugs.
Pharmaceutical companies, on the other hand, typically do not grant proprietary information about their drug compounds to academic scientists in university-industry partnerships. Given this unequal exchange of data, collaboration mainly serves the interest of the company, which receives a more complete picture of new scientific developments in relation to established applications, rather than the academic institution.
The consequences of private funding for institutional research is demonstrated by the pharmaceutical industry’s experiences with medical schools. Last year, Harvard  Medical School drew negative attention when it received an F grade by the American Medical Student Association for its failure to regulate funds provided by pharmaceuticals. The backlash included a student movement, aided by sympathetic faculty, which prompted HMS to require disclosure of faculty ties to the industry. This revealed that approximately 1,600 HMS professors and lecturers had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching, research, or clinical care or had a family member who had such a connection. In effect, many researchers are experiencing a conflict of interest, reporting “impartial” conclusive data in favor of a particular drug while they are paid to work as spokespersons for that drug. Should Harvard adhere to its plan to emphasize private funding, other science-related research branches of the university may suffer a dilemma similar to the alleged corruption of HMS.
Undoubtedly, the concept of university-industry collaboration is far from novel. Harvard maintains existing partnerships with private companies, including a five-year, $20 million relationship with chemical company BASF. Nonetheless, as University Provost Steven E. Hyman informed The Crimson, the, government support is imperative and cannot be replaced with private funding.
Instead of augmenting private sector alliances in anticipation of a decline in government funding, the University should increase efforts to safeguard existing government grants that play a significant role in financing research. Alternatively, the University could explore other avenues of funding, such as joint research with other academic institutions. In the end, Harvard’s administrators must draw careful lines to limit the influence of corporate sponsors on institutional research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The current federal budget deficit stands at $1.6 trillion. As disturbing as that is, the real cause for concern lies in the alarmingly unsustainable long-term growth of entitlement spending. The Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security—by far the largest federal entitlements—will grow from about 10 percent of GDP today to about 16 percent by 2035. Social Security, in particular, is expected to remain solvent—able to pay all legal benefits—only until 2039. The good news is that improving Social Security solvency is a relatively simple problem, and one solution, increasing the progressivity of benefits, could be acceptable to both political parties.
Social Security is an unfunded entitlement: Current workers and employers each pay a 6.2 percent payroll tax on earned income, up to an inflation-adjusted cap—$106,800 in 2010—that is deposited in the Social Security Trust Fund. The Trust Fund, in turn, makes payments to eligible citizens, those who are not working because they are either disabled or retired, the latter of whom must have reached the minimum retirement age (between 65 and 67 years depending on date of birth). Long-term spending is unsustainable because of the aging population resulting from a declining fertility rate and the retirement of the baby boomers; whereas there were 8.6 workers paying taxes for each retiree receiving benefits in 1955, there are now only 3.2, and the Social Security Administration estimates the ratio could drop as low as 2.1 by 2031.
Whereas the solution to out-of-control healthcare spending is extraordinarily complex, the answer to this problem is simple: Congress must either raise taxes or cut benefits, or some combination of the two, and must do so in a way that does not affect current retirees or people soon to retire. All that is needed is for the government to muster the political will. It’s been done before. As Jeremy A. Patashnik ’12 explains in the Harvard Political Review’s “Annual Report of the United States,” Congress passed both a payroll tax increase and a gradual increase in the retirement age in 1983 that put the Trust Fund on its current trajectory.
Whether such compromise is possible in today’s political environment is a different story. Among the proposals President Barack H. Obama’s debt-reduction commission has offered for extending solvency are indexing the retirement age to life expectancy, reducing the rate at which benefits increase to adjust for inflation, and increasing the payroll tax cap. Democratic leaders have already balked at the proposal’s effects on benefits for the middle and lower classes, and Republicans, if the current debate in Congress is any indication, are not about to accept a tax increase.
But there is one aspect of the plan, reducing benefits for the wealthy, that might draw support from both sides. The size of a monthly payment to a beneficiary is called the “primary insurance amount” and is based on what is called the “average indexed monthly earnings,” the beneficiary’s average monthly wage during the highest 35 years of earnings on which he paid payroll taxes.The PIA is 90 percent of the first $761 of the AIME, plus 32 percent of the AIME between $761 and $4,586, plus 15 percent of the AIME above $4,586. Benefits, in other words, are progressive: Low-income people receive a greater fraction of their AIME than high-income people.
The debt commission proposes reducing benefits by increasing the progressivity of the benefit formula. Gradually reducing the PIAs for the wealthier half of Social Security beneficiaries along the lines of the Commission’s recommendations would eliminate 45 percent of the Trust Fund shortfall over 75 years. The CBO released an analysis of a similar proposal that would reduce the top two PIA factors by one-third for new beneficiaries beginning in 2017, which would extend the Trust Fund exhaustion date beyond 75 years from now. Scheduled benefits would fall by 24 percent for high-income earners and just three percent for low-income earners.
The beauty of improving solvency by cutting benefits for people with high incomes is that it satisfies the ideological requirements of both political parties. For one thing, it complies with both parties’ moral philosophies: Democrats believe the wealthy should sacrifice to balance the budget, and Republicans oppose government redistribution to people who are capable of providing for themselves. It would also minimize economic impact from the perspective of both the liberal and conservative schools of thought: Keynesians would be pleased that it reduces payments to those least likely to spend the money, and supply-siders could note that it downsizes the government and would not impact incentives as severely as the proposed tax increase.
One should hasten to add that while the plan the CBO analyzed would dramatically extend solvency, it is not “sustainably solvent” since outlays would increase more rapidly than revenues after implementation. Permanent sustainability might require more extreme cuts in benefits to the wealthy, or the combination of this strategy with one or more others. That said, the longer we wait to make needed reforms, the more we will eventually have to either raise taxes or cut benefits. Whatever approach it takes, Congress needs to act sooner rather than later. Cutting benefits for those who don’t need them might be a good place to start.

Michael M. Crow, president of Arizona State University, said that he acknowledged that universities were partially at fault for the United States’ biggest problems during a talk to members of a Harvard Kennedy School program on scientific and technological innovation.
In the address at Piper Auditorium to the Program on Science, Technology, and Society (STS) last night, Crow said that despite these adverse consequences, research universities are the “principal asset for national success.”
“Decline in national competitiveness, math and science educational outcomes diminishing, fossil fuel use greatly expanded, educational attainment decline—all these things I just mentioned, you will be shocked to know that I actually hold the universities accountable for that,” Crow said. “We are part of the problem.”
According to Crow, in the past such schools were hurt by a “lack of differentiation” because they all tried to copy “elite” universities like Harvard.
“But I don’t know if it’s necessarily good for every private university in the United States to think that its mission is to emulate and ultimately topple Harvard as the number one university,” Crow said.
Crow used ASU as an example of a new type of school that he said will augment, rather than copy, the nation’s top universities.
ASU recently took steps to better address needs of its student body, including the creation of the nation’s fist School of Sustainability and the formation of a separate teacher’s college within its school of education, Crow said.
Professor Daniel P. Schrag, director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, said that Crow’s speech reminded him of what he called the media’s tendency to attack higher education.
“There is a role for the Harvards just as there is a role for Arizona State, and we need both of them,” Schrag said.
James T. Kloppenberg, chair of the Department of History, said that there was once a time when university presidents such as Harvard’s were household names. Now, “the media would rather cover Sarah Palin than they would Drew Faust,” said Kloppenberg.
The lecture was part of the STS Program’s Science and Democracy Lecture Series, which includes talks on the role of science and technology in democracies.
According to Sheila Jasanoff, a Kennedy School professor and the moderator of the event, the subject of Crow’s speech fits the lecture series.
“STS is concerned with knowledge making in all of its forms,” she said, “and that obviously makes universities and their particular role in producing knowledge a key site for STS scholarship and also STS engagement.”

Yale announced last month that it can no longer support its undergraduate teacher training program, citing high operating costs and low enrollment. UTEP, the counterpart at Harvard, does not face similar financial straits, according to UTEP Associate Director Megan H. Charner-Laird.
“UTEP is a surprisingly inexpensive program to run, since many of its courses piggyback on the Graduate School of Education courses offered for the graduate teacher education program,” Charner-Laird wrote in an e-mail statement. “I think this is a distinct difference between UTEP and Yale’s program.”
Like UTEP at Harvard, Yale’s program gives students the opportunity to earn teacher certification along with an undergraduate degree. About 18 to 25 Yale juniors sign up for courses in the preparation program each year, but few earn certification. Last year three students were certified, and none will be certified this year, according to the Yale Daily News. About 25 students enroll in Harvard’s program each year, Charner-Laird wrote.
Nicole K. Shadeed ’04, a graduate of UTEP, said Harvard tried to recruit more students to the program while she was an undergraduate.
“I had heard whispers when I was there that it wasn’t very popular,” Shaheed said. “I think the big issue is that students aren’t aware that it exists.”
Carla M. Horwitz, who directs the early childhood education program at Yale, said the dean’s office told concerned students that other avenues to the teaching profession were available to them, like Teach for America.
Horwitz and Shadeed expressed disappointment about Yale’s decision.
“I think it’s a tragedy,” Horwitz said. “I think there are so many people who have become wonderful teachers and advocates for children through the teacher preparation program.”
Shadeed said UTEP is valuable and should be retained.
“It would definitely be a shame if it was cut,” Shadeed said. “It’s definitely exactly what I was looking for in a program to train me how to be a teacher.”
Both Horwitz and Shadeed said Teach for America does not replicate a traditional teacher preparation course.
“You can’t compare the six weeks of training that TFA can do with a full year of training, doing the coursework, teaching the classes, and leaving with a certification to be a teacher,” Shadeed said.

Researchers at Harvard Medical School have reversed the aging process in mice and hope to apply this research to combat the symptoms of human aging.
The scientists, working at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, had expected to simply stabilize the aging process.
“Instead, we witnessed a dramatic reversal in the signs and symptoms of aging,” said the study’s senior author, Medical School Professor Ronald A. DePinho.
Accumulation of damage to DNA is a major cause of aging, much of which occurs at the tips of chromosomes, telomeres, according to DePinho.
The team bred several generations of genetically-modified mice to test the effects of telomerase, an enzyme which can restore telomere function, according Medical School Research Fellow and study co-author Mariela Jaskelioff.
The mice had a telomerase gene that could be toggled on and off. When the gene was turned off, the mice aged rapidly.
But when the team turned the gene back on, the aging process of the mice reversed. The mice’s worn-out organs were physically regenerated, according to DePinho. The result was that shrunken brains increased in size, the neural stem cell reserves were replenished, and coat hair was restored to a healthy sheen. The mice also regained fertility.
“This is the first time that a very severely aged, degenerative state, equivalent to what you might see in somebody who’s in the eighth or ninth decade of life, has been reversed in an animal,” DePinho said.
The research could possibly be applied to human health, according to DePinho.
“This potentially could lead to increased years of healthy living,” he said.
However, efforts to generate similar results in humans may prove more difficult.
“Human telomere dynamics are very different from mouse telomere dynamics,” Jaskelioff said.
Additional complications could arise from telomerase’s strong correlation to cancer, according Jaskelioff. Ninety percent of human cancers have highly activated telomerase, she noted.
“If you elongate the telomeres, you could prolong the lives of normal cells. But you could also be prolonging the lives of malignant cells,” Jaskelioff said.
Still, DePinho is optimistic about the practical applications of these findings.
“We need to intensify efforts to really understand the basic underpinnings of aging and age-related disease so that we can operate in a more preventive mode to increase the years of healthy living and productive life,” he said.

A cozy aura filled the rooms of the Phillips Brooks House last night at its “Winter Warmer,” the first of several outreach initiatives by the public service group.
The event, which was intended to familiarize freshmen with the Phillips Brooks House Association, also provided an opportunity for them to relax in the midst of an otherwise stressful period dominated by looming exams and approaching deadlines.
Students filtered into the house in groups of five or six, indulging in cookies, candy, and warm hot chocolate as they mingled with proctors, peer advising fellows, and Oak Yard Resident Dean Jonas V. Clark, who oversees Canaday and Thayer halls.
“This event is not about recruiting and getting students signed up,” Joseph K. Lee ’07, a proctor in Thayer, said. “It is more about getting freshmen familiarized with PBHA so if later they decide that they want to get involved, they feel comfortable walking through the door.”
As the first semester comes to a close, Clark said that this event gives students an opportunity to get involved now that they are acclimated to life at Harvard.
“At the beginning of the year when things are hectic, it’s hard to get involved,” Clark said. “This gives people who were overwhelmed a chance.”
In addition to sugary treats, the dean’s presence was another incentive for many students to come to the event.
“I followed my friends here because they all wanted to meet with the dean,” Tanya G. Mair ’14 said. “But I ended up finding out a lot of great information about the different mentoring programs.
“And its always nice to have cookies,” she added.
Although this event specifically targeted freshmen living in Oak Yard, it was the first of many scheduled by PBHA, an umbrella organization for 86 student-run programs that serve communities in the Boston and Cambridge area.
Khin-Kyemon Aung ’14, a PBHA public relations team member, said that over the course of the year, PBHA will host a similar event for each freshman yard.
“There are still quite a few freshmen who don’t know the mission and goal of PBHA on campus,” Aung said. “We want to take the opportunity to get people involved and excited about what PBHA is all about.”

Following yesterday’s release of a Pentagon report on gay and lesbian service members in the military, members of the Harvard College Democrats and Harvard College Queer Students and Allies gathered to discuss the possible impact of the report on the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy and Harvard’s current ban on the Reserve Officer Training Corps.
According to the Pentagon’s report, 70 percent of the 115,000 members of the military and 44,000 spouses who responded to the survey believed that the repeal of DADT would have no effect or a positive effect on military units. A November CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 75 percent of the American population as a whole felt similarly.
The report did not include specific recommendations, but did state that the repeal of DADT would be unlikely to jeopardize military effectiveness.
“For queer people who can’t serve openly, it’s not just an inconvenience but a denial of who they are,” said QSA Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 in reference to DADT.
Dems Treasurer Victoria E. Wenger ’14 said that in addition to marginalizing LGBT members of the military, DADT reflects poorly on the U.S. government.
“DADT is federally sanctioned lying,” said Wenger, adding that the country with the largest and most powerful military in the world should not force gay and lesbian members to lie about their lifestyles and face discharge if they tell the truth.
“The fact that this aspect of the issue is not being discussed scares me as a Democrat and an American as much as the fact that we’re condemning people’s lifestyles and civil rights,” Wenger said.
Attendees agreed that DADT should be repealed, but debated about whether a repeal ought to occasion the re-institution of ROTC at Harvard after over 40 years of being absent from campus.
“Harvard allows recruiting from the State Department and other organizations that do a lot of harm, and that double standard penalizes a lot of people who choose to serve their country through the military,” said Jonathan M. Padilla ’12. “We’re punishing people who are going to put their lives in harm’s way to protect people like us sitting here having this discussion.”
Dems Membership Director James P. Biblarz ’14 said that the U.S. military exhibits significant discrimination beyond that against gay and lesbian service members and that it also lags behind most other Western militaries in integrating female service members.
“Where do we draw the line in supporting ROTC in terms of how the military treats certain groups that are important to Democrats?” Biblarz said, noting that although women may serve in the military and are officially allowed to fill most posts, it is rare that they rise to top leadership positions.
Dems Campaigns Director Katie R. Zavadski ’13 added that students could do more to combat the military’s discrimination from within its ranks than through protest.
“The ROTC students we have here at Harvard are probably very enlightened and egalitarian—the people we would want to be going into the military to make it more welcoming for women and queer people,” she said. “If there are students with a more progressive world view in the military, it will probably become a safer place for women and queer service members alike.”

In an address that drew from her background in academia and politics, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice discussed the “ups and downs” of U.S. and international policy towards Africa last night at the Institute of Politics.
Emphasizing the need for African nations to maintain their sovereignty and the relationship between African independence and international stability, Rice criticized American foreign policy in the region.
Rice, who served as national security advisor and secretary of state under President George W. Bush, spoke about her trips to Africa, noting that the continent has not always received the international aid it needs.
”One of the saddest things I saw when we went to Rwanda was when I visited the genocide museum and saw a note written by a little boy that said ‘Don’t worry, the U.N. is coming.’ And of course the U.N. never came,” she said.
The United States has encountered difficulties in developing a policy that balances both humanitarian ideals and the desire to spread democracy to unstable nations, Rice said.
“When we try to think of American policy in terms of interests, we miss the fact that the U.S. is a deeply ideological country,” she said. “America is first and foremost an idea. We are not bound by religion, ethnicity, or nationality.”
But Rice, currently a professor of political science at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, questioned the strength of U.S. policy in the region, particularly with the growing influence of China.
While China will be a factor in Africa’s future, according to Rice, she also added that “the important question is if African leaders will hold China accountable.”
Rice called on citizens of African nations to demand accountability from their own governments as well.
“It is high time that Africans take responsibility for where Africa is going,” she said. “You will not have democratic governments for very long if they cannot help the people.”
Audience members praised Rice, both for her speech and for her achievements.
“Her character is second to none,” said Kip C. Christianson ’13, a member of the Harvard Republican Club. “She is a worthy inspiration to all people regardless of their backgrounds.”
Chenie Yoon, a Harvard Kennedy School student in attendance, said she appreciated Rice’s support of young women who are pursuing careers in public policy.
“I think for Condoleezza Rice to come to the school and tell us to go for it is such an inspiration for young women interested in politics.”

Built a bit like a star high school football player, Taylor B. Evans '14 looks the part of a Marine. While he wears t-shirts and jeans even in the roughest of weather, on occasion the casual attire gives way to a green Marine Corps service uniform—the seams and cuts fit exactly over his broad shoulders and powerful arms. Evans looks like he could storm a beach at a moments notice, or maybe like he was born in uniform.
But for this five-year Marine Corps veteran, combat is a distant possibility. This semester, Evans, 23, enrolled at the College as a freshman.
Most of his fellow classmates arrived from America’s cities, suburbs, and prep-schools nervous about making friends, fitting in, and doing well. Evans arrived with a tour of duty under his belt, a wife, and a recently born daughter, Haley.
With his years in the Marine Corps, Evans is far from the typical freshman. Serious and intent—and with a family of his own to boot—Evans stands above and outside the community of students of which he is ostensibly a member.
Evans approaches his college experience with the same goals and expectations that he approaches the rest of his life—ultimately, he hopes to serve and contribute to society.
But these experiences also disconnect him from his fellow students, many of whom see military service as either a largely foreign concept or a rarely-considered option for the future.
Still, at a time when the University has garnered criticism for its alleged opposition to the military and what it represents, Evans’ experience also allows him to reconsider what it means for Harvard to produce individuals with a commitment to public service.
A SOLDIER AT HARVARD
A day in Evans’ life is unlike that of most other Harvard freshmen. As the last students shuffle out of Lamont Library at 4:45 a.m. on Monday, Evans starts his day,
He begins by driving from his apartment on the border of Cambridge and Belmont to Boston University, where he leads a Reserve Officer Training Corps unit in physical training. At 7 a.m. he returns home for a rest before taking the bus back to Harvard for a full day of classes that runs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. While his evening schedule varies, he generally spends some time fulfilling ROTC obligations at MIT.
Evans passes much of his time during the week like other College students—reading and working on problem sets. But unlike other students, this often comes at the detriment of his spending time with his wife and daughter.
“He’s mastered having the book in one hand and the baby in the other,” says his wife, Stephanie Evans.
While Evans interacts with the other freshmen in his classes and occasionally participates in activities held for his Massachusetts Hall entryway, his contact with the rest of the student body has been limited. And a busy college schedule and the demands of caring for a small child limits the couple’s ability to meet people and make friends.
“People have come to visit, but I focus on the family, focus on the baby,” Stephanie says with a smile.
While raising a child may be tough, the couple says that for a military family they are extremely fortunate.
“I have to worry about not seeing my wife for a couple of days... there are guys who have to worry about not seeing their wives for months,” Evans says.
LESS RESENTMENT, MORE INTEREST
“Harvard was and remains the punch line of a joke,” Evans says, referring to the University’s perception among his military counterparts. Still, his experiences convince him that their idea of the school does not quite ring true.
As it was for so many others, Harvard had been little more than a fantasy for Evans before his acceptance. Prior to his arrival as a student, he was not sure exactly what to expect.
“I was told Harvard is an anti-military school, that I wouldn’t have anything in common with the people here,” Evans says of what he sees as one of the larger misconceptions people have of Harvard.
But the idea that Harvard harbors strong dislike for or resentment toward the military is not the case, Evans says.
From what he has seen, Evans says this view of Harvard is false. Administrators such as Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Evans’ Resident Dean enthusiastically reached out to offer him any additional support he may have needed as he transitioned to the College.
Students have reacted to his story more with interest and awe than with disdain or derision and have shown interest in learning more about his life and experiences, Evans says.
As someone whose career is dedicated to service, Evans says he has been impressed by his classmates’ own desire to do the same.
Despite students’ eagerness to serve, he says that he still wishes more of them would consider serving in the military.
“Harvard has the best and strongest minds. It would be a tragedy not to use that talent in pursuit of [defending America and its values],” he said.
Despite his desire to see more Harvard students in the military, Evans says he understands the reasons why students opt to serve elsewhere.
“People at Harvard are accustomed to freedom,” Evans says. “Going from the exploration and freedom you have here to the lifestyle of the military would be like a car crash.”
A FRESHMAN WITH A FAMILY
When first year students arrive in the fall, many are still wide-eyed kids, nervous, and a bit scared about what their college careers have in store for them—a set of concerns slightly removed from Evans.
“I came in with a much clearer understanding of the world,” says Evans, comparing his perspective to those of his classmates. As a reminder of the disparity between Evans and his fellow freshmen, he often slips and refers to them as “kids.”
But with a child of his own, maybe that is not surprising. Two and a half years into his time in Korea, the couple’s daughter, Haley, was born in March of 2010.
Evans and Stephanie met as high school students in Abu Dhabi and serendipitously reunited in 2007 while Stephanie was a student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Evans was stationed just up the California coast at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey where he studied to become a cryptologic Korean linguist, a job that includes analyzing reports in Korean.
The couple spent weekends on the coast between Monterey and Los Angeles. They married in 2007, shortly before departing for Korea, where Evans spent his first tour.
In 2009, Evans was selected for the Marine Enlisted Commissioning Education Program, which provides approximately 90 Marines each year with the opportunity to take time off from regular service and attend a college of their choice. Marines that participate in the program are required to remain in the Corps for at least four years after graduation.
So with a baby on the way and a wife on his arm, Evans applied and was—to his surprise—admitted to Harvard.
While the couple also considered Georgetown and Notre Dame, Harvard’s allure and financial aid package proved too good to turn down.
Stephanie had been accepted to several law schools, but that was before her daughter’s birth and her husband’s acceptance at Harvard. While she has put her plans to attend law school on hold to take care of her daughter, she says she plans to enroll in law school somewhere in the Boston area while Evans is at Harvard.
AROUND THE WORLD AND BACK
While visiting Cairo as a high school student, Evans was approached on a street corner by two children begging for money.
Around the corner, Evans could see the man for whom they worked and who probably abused them. Evans could not decide whether helping the children was worth lining the pockets of their abuser.
“I can’t help but think about what it is like to live an existence like that,” Evans says. “Maybe now I can understand a little bit of the violence that occurs.”
Evans spent his childhood moving from place to place around the world, an experience that informed his understanding of the United States. As a child with a father in the Air Force, Evans lived in four states and three foreign countries but describes his time in the United Arab Emirates as especially influential on his world-view.
He moved to the Middle Eastern nation after starting high school in what he describes as “a very Christian oriented, family-focused Colorado town.”
“There are truths to some things that you hear, but there are also many falsehoods,” Evans says in reference to the American perception of the Middle East.
After living in such a radically different environment, Evans returned to Colorado with a more open view of the world, a view that he says did not necessarily align with the culture he had left behind in the United States.
“These conservative Christian truths that I had never questioned before, I all of the sudden could not let stand,” Evans says.
But the time spent overseas also resulted in a stronger appreciation of America and the values it espouses, which inspired him to consider a career in the military.
“The ideas of justice and equality have so much more meaning to me because of what I’ve seen,” he says. “The spirit of the military is in the noble defense of the values that America thinks are important, that are good for all of humanity. That’s the military at heart.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Harvard Business School yesterday, 63 students discussed a case study on Coca-Cola’s pricing, a typical Business School classroom activity—but undertaken this time by seventh graders from the Lilla G. Frederick Pilot Middle School in Dorchester.
This visit comprises one component of the Business School’s Impact Initiative, a community service program launched earlier this year by the Business School Student Association, the school’s student government.
The initiative aims to make a positive impact on the lives of Boston-area middle school students and instill leadership skills through education and mentorship.
Through this program, the Business School also hosted 43 seventh-grade students from the James P. Timilty Middle School in Roxbury earlier this month.
“These types of initiatives help students break out of the business school bubble, interact with the people they will one day serve, and better understand the world from the perspective of all people, making them a more compassionate and effective leader,” said Business School alumnus Jonathan Doochin, who first conceived of the initiative.
In September, 120 first-year Business School students went to the Frederick Pilot and Timilty Schools to introduce the students to the initiative’s leadership curriculum.
Gail A. Brown, a teacher at Frederick Pilot, recalled how that visit inspired her seventh graders to assume leadership roles. After the September event, two of her students, Nakeo Murray and Gabriela Reyes, ran for and were elected to the school’s student council, according to Brown.
“When the HBS students came to the Pilot and gave out mirrors to the kids to show them that they were leaders, it really made an impression on them,” Brown said. “The students, and especially Nakeo, looked in the mirror and saw that they could be leaders.”
Aja J. Jackson, Frederick Pilot School administrator, said that the Impact Initiative provides Frederick Pilot students with a unique chance to learn more about higher education.
“Many of these students don’t have opportunities to be exposed to much outside of their community,” said Jackson. “This visit to HBS will plant seeds in their mind that they can earn a higher education degree and be a professor, business leader, or Harvard graduate.”
In addition to the case study, the middle school students participated in a question and answer session with Business School Professor David A. Thomas, who fielded questions about his education and becoming a professor.
Thomas recounted his path to success and how he overcame the challenges of growing up as an African-American in a Missouri family of modest means during the civil rights movement, a story which Brown said inspired her students.
Business School Professor Zeynep Ton, who led the Coca-Cola case discussion, said that this program also presents Business School students with an opportunity to engage with their surrounding community.
“The mission of the Harvard Business School is to educate leaders to make a difference in the world,” Ton said. “This initiative fulfills that mission. This program is a chance for our students to go into different communities and be inspired, and also make a big impact.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Political pundits and professors gathered at the Kennedy School last night to commemorate one of their most memorable teachers, the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who died almost two years ago of congestive heart failure at age 81.
A panel of Huntington’s former students—including CNN host and Time Magazine editor Fareed R. Zakaria, Johns Hopkins Professor  Eliot A. Cohen ’77, Political Economist Francis Fukuyama, and Foreign Affairs Managing Editor Gideon G. Rose—discussed Huntington’s academic and personal legacy in front of an audience of Harvard graduate and undergraduate students.
“He was a man of great principle even though it was not always a principle that was popular,” Zakaria said.
Huntington was one of the most influential and controversial political academics of the last fifty years. His theory that war is the result of cultural clashes has  implications for immigration that make it one of his most widely cited and contested ideas.
The panelists shared an admiration for his personality, and also praised him as an academic and professor.
Cohen remembered how Huntington “knew how to challenge students without brow beating or bullying them and how to support them without coddling.”
“He was so damned smart,” Rose added.
Though the panelists did not necessarily endorse Huntington’s views, they agreed that his bravery in creating and enduring controversy was part of what made him a great professor.
“He always liked it when you fought with him,” Rose said.
Audience members questioned the panel on Huntington’s controversial stance toward immigration and his tendency to make generalizations.
Laura M. Esquivel, a mid-career student at the Kennedy School, called the discussion a “farce” because it avoided discussion of Huntington’s most controversial works.
“They did not answer my question,” said Esquivel, referring to a point she raised during the discussion about Huntington’s view that Anglo-Protestant Culture is superior to all others. “I am personally offended as a Mexican American.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s and women’s squash teams have dominated so far this season. Collectively undefeated through five contests, the squads have won 44 individual matches while only dropping one.
But the competition is about to get a little tougher—at least for the men.
Both the No. 1 women (3-0, 1-0 Ivy) and the No. 5 men (2-0, 1-0) face Dartmouth this Wednesday at the Murr Center in the Crimson’s second Ivy League match of the season.
On the men’s side, the No. 7 Big Green (3-0, 0-0) is Harvard’s highest-ranked opponent of the young season. The Crimson defeated then-No. 14 Brown and then-No. 11 Williams last week.
“Williams and Brown—they’re not bad teams, but they weren’t really going to push us,” freshman Gary Power said. “But on Wednesday, we’re definitely going to be pushed, so it’s a good judge of where we are right now.”
The Harvard women have already faced higher-ranked teams than No. 8 Dartmouth (2-0, 0-0). In fact, last week, the Crimson dismantled No. 6 Stanford, winning 9-0. But Harvard refuses to underestimate its opponent.
“Dartmouth’s a really good team this year,” captain Alisha Mashruwala said. “They’ve improved a lot in the last year. They got some good players, so I think it’ll be a fun match.”
In 2009, both the Crimson men and women beat the Big Green, winning 6-3 and 9-0, respectively. But the real drama occurred off the playing surface, as rowdy Dartmouth fans yelled derogatory remarks at the Harvard women and made comments towards Frank E. Cohen ’10 that his parents took as anti-Semitic. Dartmouth President Jim Yong Kim subsequently issued an apology to Harvard President Drew Gilpin Faust and wrote an email to the Dartmouth community condemning the harassment.
But to the players, last year’s incident doesn’t change anything.
“As far as the Harvard team is concerned, we’re over that,” senior Richard Hill said. “We’re very excited [for the match], but not in a way that is malicious or vindictive.”
MEN’S SQUASH VS. DARTMOUTH
While the match against the Big Green is the biggest test so far, it’s just the beginning of an important stretch for the Crimson men.  Over the weekend, Harvard heads to New York to face off against No. 4 Rochester and No. 6 Cornell.
“Beating Dartmouth would give us a lot of momentum…[and] a huge confidence booster for this weekend,” Hill said.
To defeat Dartmouth, Harvard will once again have to lean heavily on its freshmen, who make up three of the top four and four of the nine players in the lineup. So far, the rookies have played lights out, going 8-0 in matches while losing just one game.
“They’ve played a huge role so far,” captain Reed Endresen said. “They’ve done a great job stepping up and just being leaders.”
No freshman has risen to the challenge more than Power, who currently holds the top spot for the Crimson. But this week will be his toughest test on the collegiate level so far, as he faces the Big Green’s Chris Hanson. A first team All-American, Hanson was the eighth-best collegiate player in the country last year.
While Power beat Hanson twice when in Juniors, the Dartmouth sophomore’s game has grown significantly since the two last met.
“Hanson has improved over the last season…[and] he has a ton of experience,” Hill said. “That being said, I’m very confident Gary can [win]…he’s very confident, he’s very strong, and he definitely always rises to the occasion when it matters the most.”
WOMEN’S SQUASH VS. DARTMOUTH
After winning last year’s CSA national championship, the women’s squash team has continued its high level of play, dispatching Brown, Stanford, and Williams, all by scores of 9-0.
But, victory may not come as easily over the Big Green. Dartmouth’s top nine consists of seven returning players, and by all accounts the team has improved greatly since last year.
The contest has added significance given that it is an Ivy League match. For Harvard, beating the Big Green would be an important first step in taking the league crown again.
“They’re a strong team,” sophomore Laura Gemmell said. “It’s…an important match for us, so everyone’s taking it seriously.”
Gemmell, last year’s CSA individual champion and Harvard’s No. 1 player, has handily won her first three matches of the season. But, of those opponents, just one broke the top fifty in last year’s rankings. She faces her toughest competitor of the year in Dartmouth’s Valeria Wiens, a first team All-American.
“She’s a very good player,” Gemmell said. “I’m expecting a really good, tough match with her.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The invasion has come—ready your tin foil hats.
Last month, the North Carolina company StatSheet released upon the Internet its “Robot Army,” a massive system of websites designed to track each and every NCAA Division I men’s basketball team and write up game summaries, previews, and histories bolstered with an impressive amount of statistics and graphs.
Does the advent of the StatSheet Network represent the death of the common (human) sportswriter?
Its impressive automated number-crunching abilities are certainly something to gander at.
Each website dedicated to a school provides a thorough breakdown of every game, including the matchup’s progression, a detailed analysis of the major players’ contributions, and an algorithm predicting how well the team will do this season relative to last year.
Furthermore, the Network compiles all of this data for 345 NCAA Division I teams in every conference in the country (ever hear of the Horizon Conference? StatSheet did).
Despite its features and prospective, though, it’s not yet time for the bell to toll.
One could make any number of criticisms of the Robot Army. The lack of compelling quotes, bias in favor of the home team, and annoying typos provide just a few. Note, however, that these jeers might be made concerning just about any sports publication.
In a New York Times article published Sunday, Randall Stross takes a different approach, critiquing the website for its lack of complexity. Stross indicates the system, although compelling in some of its vernacular, is ultimately limited by a finite number of phrases, structures and statistical comparisons.
Even acknowledging this argument, I’m still not convinced that we’ve exposed the Army’s greatest weakness.
Let’s say that the sports nerd-computer geek hybrids over at StatSheet perfect their code to create sentence structures as sophisticated as the numerous graphs sprawled across the screen. Let’s also say that typos became as uncommon as kegs at the Harvard-Yale tailgate and the Network learns to cherry-pick quotes from other publications. What then?
We must keep in mind that even with standard game recaps and previews, a certain human element ultimately brings the story to life. There is immense value to witnessing the game, soaking in the atmosphere, understanding the crowd, and seeing the coach’s expression in the post-game press conference as he or she speaks about the other team.
Veteran sportswriter John Lowe pointed out this sort of limitation when asked for his opinion. Although Lowe “has nothing against it,” he noted the restrictive nature of the materials StatSheet draws upon to generate its articles.
“[The Network]’s just taking what’s on the box [score] and play-by-play and turning it into sentences and paragraphs,” Lowe said. “But really the increasing point of sports journalism is you’ve got to go beyond what’s in the box score and play-by-play, because everyone has decent access to those things.”
Lowe’s been covering baseball for the Detroit Free Press since 1986 and knows how a play simply recorded as a “fly-out to center” in the box score was actually the crucial moment in a World Series (i.e., “The Catch,” in 1954).
“That’s why we like sports,” Lowe said. “It’s played by real human beings and by teams we care about.”
A plethora of stats cannot tell the larger story of a game or team—its struggle through injuries, the triumphant upsets and the emotional losses experienced beyond the court. A computer can tell you that two years ago Jeremy Lin ‘10 was the only NCAA player to place among the top ten competitors in ten major statistical categories, but it cannot articulate why else we find him interesting.
Although fascinating, StatSheet’s creation is ultimately less of an army than it is a fast food chain in the sports publication world. It might represent a satisfying quick-fix to get some fans through the day, but the rational reader will recognize the absence of more important components.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In last night’s fast-skating and hard-hitting battle between two offensively minded teams, No. 18 Merrimack (6-3-4, 4-3-3 Hockey East) came out on top over Harvard (2-7-0, 2-6-0 ECAC) by a final score of 3-1 at Bright Hockey Center.
In its second-ever game against the Warriors, the Crimson was outshot, 39-15, and was forced to defend its net for most of the night.
“They played well and moved the puck out of their zone and were able to keep us in our zone,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “Our guys battled, but there’s certainly a lot of room for improvement.”
The Crimson opened the match in lackluster fashion. Harvard was outshot by a margin of 14-6 in the period, and assistant captain Kyle Richter was forced to stop a flurry of attempts in the final two minutes of the first period, including a thumper on his left pad.
“We need to start games earlier, score earlier, to put teams behind and get on the power play and be more effective on our special teams,” Donato said.
But to be fair, the Crimson did have its chances.
Following Merrimack’s first goal, coming late in the second frame, two Warriors forwards were whistled for hooking in quick succession. With a five-on-three situation, Harvard had a golden opportunity to even the scoreline but ultimately failed to generate any threatening shots at goal during the power play.
“We were a little stagnant,” Donato said. “We actually talked about [a five-on-three], this morning and we weren’t able to execute the type of puck movement that would allow us to be successful.”
Merrimack built on its lead when sophomore Stephane Da Costa scored on a breakaway rush at 8:34 in the third. The second-year forward received the puck from senior Chris Barton at mid-rink before skating in and deflecting a shot into the net.
A greater sense of urgency set in for the Crimson, now down 2-0. On a changeover, junior forward Alex Killorn took control of the puck at the blue line before moving in and scoring on a shot between the legs of Warriors goaltender Joe Cannata.
“I was kind of surprised that I had a lot of room between me and the defense,” Killorn said. “Conor Morrison drove the net and gave me some room, so it was just me and the goalie. I got lucky with the shot, and it worked out well.”
Harvard had another opportunity to even the score following Killorn’s goal—his fourth of the season—when Merrimack captain Adam Ross received a penalty for interference.
Though Cannata was forced to make a big save on a slapshot from sophomore defenseman Danny Biega, the Crimson couldn’t generate any further shots on goal, as the Warriors’ penalty kill team continued to break up its power play formations.
“I think we had some chances,” Donato said. “Although [Cannata] didn’t have to make a lot of saves, I did think he made some good saves, especially on the power play, so it’s one of those things where we have to be able to get that desperation right from the start.”
That desperation was certainly there at the end of the game.
With just over a minute left to play, Harvard pulled Richter. But even with the man advantage, the Crimson couldn’t find the back of the net. The Warriors clinched their victory with 27.3 seconds left, when junior Kyle Stollery’s lob from mid-rink sailed into the empty goal.
The loss is the latest in Harvard’s six-game losing streak and comes after a pair of pummelings by Dartmouth over the weekend.
“We need to get the ball going in the other direction and get some positive momentum,” Donato said. “It’s certainly frustrating, but we have faith we can be a good hockey team.”
“We can talk all we want…but it’s really about doing it on the ice and going through with your actions,” Killorn added. “[Last night] was a stepping stone. We played a lot better than we did against Dartmouth, but there’s still a lot of improvement to be made.”

In addition to the fun and excitement that the Harvard-Yale rivalry always brings to Cambridge, The Game brought "a shitload of nerds together" in the words of Fox Sports. Fox compiled a four-minute montage which highlighted some quirky antics of students from both schools as they interacted with reporter Bob Oschack at the tailgate.
The video, entitled "Geeks Gone Wild II," demonstrated students' pre-Game energy while revealing some of their nerdier pastimes. In the spirit of the competition happening inside the stadium, Oschack kept score to determine which school was nerdiest. Harvard took the prize.
Fox Sports released the first installment in the "Geeks Gone Wild" series last year, after covering the Game in New Haven. Alexander M. Ma '13 said he jumped at the chance to be in this year's video when he recognized Oschack from the year before.
During his television appearance, Ma articulately explained the convoluted end of the popular TV show Lost, demonstrating his geeky side.
"My friends thought it was pretty funny," Ma said. "I am a huge Lost fan, so I was lucky that he asked me that question."
Yohannes C. Constable '12 also demonstrated his ability to think quickly on his feet by rattling off answers to trivia questions fired at him by Oschack.
"I watch Jeopardy! all the time," Constable said. "I actually got eight in a row right, but I kept cursing so he had to cut some of it."
Constable acknowledged that the two schools' nerdy reputation is perhaps well-deserved.
"I thought most of the kids in the video were goobers," Constable said.

For $17.99 (recently reduced from $28) plus a $10 shipping fee, you can order a "Harvard Beats Yale 29-29" shirt, which bears the famous headline from the Nov. 25, 1968, issue of The Crimson.
The product description even gives The Crimson a shout-out: "Crimson Tie. Soft heathered tee from Homage, printed at the front with a Harvard Beats Yale graphic borrowed from a Harvard Crimson headline published after the legendary 1968 Game, in which Harvard came from behind, scoring 16 points in the final 42 seconds to tie Yale."
This "legendary" shirt seems to be one of several Game-related tees, including vintage Harvard and Yale tops. A spokesperson for Urban Outfitters told us that the shirt, which still costs $28 if you buy it in-store in Harvard Square, was chosen because of "Ivy League and heritage-inspired trends."
Perhaps Urban Outfitters customers might find $28 an acceptable price to pay for the chance to wear something that will make people think they went to Harvard or Yale.

With finals fast approaching, it’s not uncommon to spot Lamonsters napping though parts of their 36-hour study marathons at the library. Equally often, you will probably spot people squeezing in quick dozes between classes.
"Sleeping at Lamont," a newly created tumblr, is putting these exhaustion-induced naps on display. The website calls for photographs to be sent to sleepingatlamont@gmail.com. Check it out for yourselves—but be aware! Just as you might take a photograph of someone sleeping in the library, they may just snap a photo of you.
Who's behind this tableau of tiredness?  We'll let you know if we find out.
