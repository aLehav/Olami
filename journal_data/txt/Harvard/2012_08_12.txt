After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Scott Brown charged this week that a lawsuit which prompted Massachusetts to send voter registration forms to thousands of welfare recipients was intended by the group that brought the suit to aid Elizabeth Warren’s Senate campaign. Brown demanded that Warren reimburse taxpayers the costs of the mailings, which he called an “unprecedented voter registration drive.”
The debate—just the latest firestorm in the high-profile race between incumbent Brown and Democratic challenger Warren—centers on whether Warren or Massachusetts Democrats influenced a court case brought by New York policy and advocacy group Demos. Warren’s daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, is the chair of Demos’ board of directors, and several board members have donated to Warren’s Senate campaign. Brown alleged that Warren used her connection to Demos to encourage the organization to raise the case, which would increase the number of potential Democratic voters in November.
“Professor Warren has more than $13 million dollars in her campaign account, and if she wants to mail every welfare recipient a voter registration form, she should do so at her own expense, not taxpayers’,” Brown said in a statement Friday.
Democrats replied that Brown was unfairly tying Warren to a case that is simply a matter of law enforcement.
Along with other advocacy groups, Demos has filed suits similar to the one in question in Massachusetts in 18 states since 2004, in an effort to increase implementation of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, known colloquially as “Motor Voter.” The law, which has attracted a great deal of controversy since its adoption, requires that voter registration materials be proactively made available at all public assistance offices.
In the case brought against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in May, Demos claimed that the state had failed to make such materials available to citizens, resulting in plummeting registration application numbers among those receiving federal assistance in recent years. An interim agreement reached on July 5 required the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance to mail voter registration forms and pre-paid envelopes, at taxpayer expense, to roughly 478,000 welfare recipients Demos claimed were affected.
Brown’s campaign first raised concerns about the case on Wednesday, saying the case was “clearly designed to benefit [Warren's] political campaign.”
In response, a Demos statement called Brown’s claims “completely off base” and defended Tyagi.
“We completely reject the Brown campaign’s or anyone else’s assertion that this is politically motivated or coordinated in any way,” said Demos president Mike Rapoport. “Amelia Warren Tyagi...would not and did not encourage any work in order to benefit her mother’s campaign.”
Warren’s campaign manager Mindy Myers said in a statement, “His entire attack is built on efforts in multiple states to enforce a law passed almost twenty years ago with bipartisan support. Even the Bush Justice Department filed suit to enforce this provision of that law. For Brown to claim this is some kind of plot against him is just bizarre.”
Harvard Kennedy School lecturer David King said that though Demos’ political liberalism is no secret, it is highly unlikely that Warren in any way affected the suit or the ruling.
“All [Demos is] involved with is asking states to follow the federal law,” he said. Several states have defied the Motor Voter guidelines for political reasons, King said, since Republicans historically have viewed the act a path to more votes from traditionally Democratic welfare recipients.
King said he believes Brown is trying to further a narrative that Warren is privileged and out of touch. “It’s completely for political reasons,” he said. “It would be hard to believe that anyone in the Scott Brown campaign would actually believe what they’re saying.”
Republican political consultant Todd Domke disagreed, saying that Republicans in Massachusetts are used to Democrats taking advantage of their control over the state government for personal gain, and Brown is justified in calling foul.
“Frankly, Republicans in the state have been aware for decades that the coincidences favor the Democrats when it comes to government boosting prospects for liberal candidates and using government money to promote themselves,” Domke said. “If there was no political motivation, if the Warrens are pure of heart, do people think that Demos would have been pressing this if they thought the result was adding a great many more Republicans to registration lists?”
Whether or not the allegations, or the court ruling, will have enough influence to tip the neck-and-neck race toward either camp remains to be seen. Traditionally, higher voter turnout means better chances for Democrats in Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than one hundred cyclists celebrated the expansion of the year-old Boston bike-sharing program Hubway to Cambridge on Wednesday with a group bike ride from Central Square to Harvard Square and a celebration at the Holyoke Center. “Hub-way! Hub-way!” shouted the crowd in front of City Hall, where Mayor Henrietta J. Davis lauded the program, describing its success in Boston.
Wednesday’s event marked the official extension of Hubway—which is operated by the bike-sharing company Alta—to Cambridge, Brookline, and Somerville.
The program has met a warm welcome from cyclists, who, according to Davis, comprise 7 to 10 percent of the city’s population. “Something hugely exciting is happening,” said Brent Whelan ’73, an Allston resident and decades-long Boston-area cyclist who attended the event. “Not just with Hubway. With bike lanes all over Boston and other biking considerations built into infrastructure, we're getting close to that break point where biking is really legitimized.”
By the end of August, Hubway plans to operate 24 stations across Cambridge, including seven Harvard-donated stations on campus. Harvard sponsored five of the stations, which cost approximately $50,000 each, near the Longwod and Allston campuses last year.
According to Harvard sustainability spokesperson Colin B. Durrant, the new stations will be located at the Quad, the corner of Cowperwaithe and Dewolfe Streets, Peabody Terrace, the Law School, the Kennedy School, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and Gund Hall. He said he hopes all of the Harvard stations will be operational when the semester starts.
Durrant said that there is no plan to offer a student discount on Hubway membership, which costs $85 per year.
“Large institutions like Universities and hospitals have been some of the best partners...because places like Harvard are already doing so much,” said Jessica Robertson, a transportation coordinator at the Metro Area Planning Committee.
To use Hubway stations, cyclists are required to buy passes for a length of one day, three days, or a full year. These passes allow cyclists an unlimited number of rides shorter than thirty minutes, with additional charges for longer trips.
“It’s really perfect for short trips and commuting,” said Scott Mullen, general manager of the program.
Robertson added, “When it comes to transportation and infrastructure, [bike sharing] is really good bang for your buck.”
Thus far the project has cost about $9 million, Robertson said, and it has it has clocked just over 400,000 rides in its year of operation.
Christine Heenan, the University’s vice president for public affairs and communications, explained that Harvard was drawn to help the program because of the environmental and social benefits of bike sharing.
“Hubway represents an exciting new opportunity to further knit our communities together,” Heenan said in a statement. “Whether in education, housing, or the environment, we are committed to working together with our neighboring communities to develop solutions and programs that lead to a better future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
LONDON—The opening ceremony always seemed to me an especially out of place element of the Olympics. On the eve of a fortnight of ferocious athletic competition, viewers are treated to three hours of the most elaborate performance art most will see for the next four years. Outside of the amount of preparation required, the sight of a giant Voldemort being assailed by an army of Mary Poppinses doesn’t seem to share much in common with a marathon or a discus throw.
However, after experiencing the games live for the first time, I’ve come to realize that both are indispensable to the Olympics’ identity. The games wouldn’t mean what they do to us without the pageantry—the national anthems, the medal ceremonies, the torch lighting. The repetition of these rites keeps the almost mystical importance of the Olympics intact internationally, though the modern sporting landscape doesn’t resemble 1896 Athens in the slightest. But the games also cannot be separated from what they are, at root: a series of fiercely contested sporting events, featuring the world’s most impressive athletes.
Tennis was my first exposure to Olympic competition, and on Wimbledon’s Centre Court, pageantry is king. Competition takes place on a verdant shag carpet of grass, about the length of what you might find on a well-tended golf fairway. The ball, when struck by a forehand or sliced deep toward the baseline, doesn’t so much bounce on the grass as it lands and is then gently cushioned up again. Though a very modern-looking stadium, complete with retractable roof, encloses the scene, simply taking my seat seemed to elevate my status to “19th-century country gentleman.”
I watched with amusement as the ball girls sprinted back and forth to their designated posts around the perimeter of the court, heaving tennis balls to players with goofy straight-armed tosses. At each changeover, players would take their seats alongside their bags, an umbrella held to shield them from the weakly pulsing sun by an eager ball girl. Even Serena Williams, not exactly renowned for her ladylike manners on the court, projected an eerily calm demeanor while on the court, seemingly forcing herself to count to ten every time she didn’t zing a winner past an overmatched Jelena Jankovic. Whether the ball was in or out, the end of each point was met with the same uniformly polite smattering of applause, almost as if the crowd felt a constant need to give the competitors a hand just for making it there.
But no veneer, no matter how thick, can totally disguise the primal nature of competitive athletics, and the other side of the Olympics becomes more plainly evident in those sports that make no pretense of disguising it. I discovered this while attending a sport that, while unfamiliar to most Americans, seems likely to fit in fairly well with American sporting culture: handball.
Handball is a gym class all-star’s dream sport; opportunities to whip a ball at the face of a hapless nerd—in this case, the goalie—come early and often. The game itself is a weird melding of basketball and lacrosse. Players dribble and swing the ball around the perimeter as in basketball, but defenders are allowed to make contact with the attackers as long as they stay in front of them, like in lacrosse. The slow build up of dribble-pass, dribble-pass eventually crests with the satisfying payoff of an offensive player leaping through the air and whistling a fastball toward the net, finding the target more often than not.
The atmosphere inside the Copper Box, which housed the men’s and women’s Olympic handball tournaments, reminded me of an Arena Football game, minus the cheerleaders dancing on the field of play (though they wouldn’t have been out of place). From what I gathered, the accepted protocol at handball games is to grab a couple of Heinekens immediately upon entering the venue, followed by optional (but encouraged) participation in the patriotic chants of a country to which you may or may not have any affiliation. “When in London,” I said to myself, and dutifully adhered to the prevailing etiquette.
In the first game I attended, the fans of host Great Britain had little to cheer about, suffering a crushing 44-15 loss to rival and defending gold medalist France. The loudest roars from the home crowd might have come for British goalie Jesper Parker, whose behavior certainly fit the description of hapless nerd; despite deficits of upwards of 25 goals, Parker demonstrated wildly to the crowd on the rare occasion his body seemingly accidentally navigated itself between the ball and the back of the net.
The second game provided more drama, with medal hopefuls Hungary and Denmark attempting to get their tournaments off to positive starts. I adopted the Hungarians as my temporary countrymen, joining in lusty chants of “RIA! RIA! HUN-GA-RIA!” every time a ball buzzed past the Danish goalie’s flailing limbs. The game was a seesaw affair, with both teams remaining within one or two goals of each other throughout, until a back-breaking goal from Danish left winger Anders Eggert Jensen sealed the enemy’s victory with 17 seconds remaining. “We’d win in a war, anyway,” I grumbled as I shuffled out of the arena, the classic consolation of the bitter Olympic fan.
Though I had seen only a fraction of the Olympic catalog in these two days, I felt like I gained a much more intimate understanding of what the games are truly about. The pomp and the flair are remnants of the original ideal of amateurism, wobbly though it may be, but they cannot cover up completely the raw energy of world-class athletic competition and the raucous fans that accompany it. Still, the ceremony of the Olympics is necessary to maintain the sense of awe and global appeal that makes them, every few years, a safe haven from the real world, a time to forget international squabbling and appreciate human achievement for what it is. So while I may have rolled my eyes when I saw Mr. Bean edited into Chariots of Fire—“just get me to the 100 meters, please!”—I now see a little more clearly why tickets to the closing ceremony are running around $2,000 apiece. It’s the last time, for another four years, for people to connect with the worldwide fellowship and accomplishment the Olympics are meant to promote, and that’s something worth shelling out for—even if you find British artistic taste a little screwy.
