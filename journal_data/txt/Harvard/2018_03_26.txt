After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In her first full-length novel, “The Parking Lot Attendant,” Nafkote Tamirat plunges into the life of a Boston-born teenager with Ethiopian parents. This unnamed girl tells the story of her disjointed family and the events that left her longing for a steadfast, loving figure in her life. She tells of Ayale, a charismatic and extremely enigmatic parking-lot attendant, whose ostensibly mundane job is unusual considering his far-reaching influence. She tells the story of life on an unnamed island, the mysterious setting of both the beginning and end of the novel. Over the course of 225 pages, the narrator slowly weaves these accounts together, culminating in questions that are slowly but all the more gratifyingly answered, barring some cliffhangers at the close of the novel.
The first-person point of view of the novel is colloquial enough for it to seem as if she, a 15-year-old girl, is the actual author. The unnamed narrator simply relays her life story to those who will listen, while staying eloquent enough for us to see the trademarks of a practiced writer (Tamirat) throughout the chapters. Some sentences are short and laden with expletives, whereas others are articulate and graceful. Overall, the descriptions are elegant, such as when the narrator describes the island’s sand as “white and, as far as it’s possible for sand to enjoy this quality, fluffy. There’s something seductive about it, especially when compared with the pebble-strewn gray-brown harshness of my childhood.” This immersive style of Tamirat’s writing is enthralling from the beginning to the end.
The novel has an autobiographical feel thanks to its familiarity with both Bostonian and Ethiopian culture, which provides intrigue. The introduction of Ayale’s character almost immediately compounds this interest, a man it seems the whole world is obsessed with. As the narrator begins to learn more and more about this character, it is easy to develop this obsession as well. “The Parking Lot Attendant” is bolstered through its use of descriptive background information—of Boston, of Ethiopian culture, of Ayale.
In addition to the mixed diction and syntax in this book, Tamirat’s employment of mystery makes for a captivating novel. First, one wonders how an Ethiopian family from Boston arrived at an unnamed island where they are clearly not welcomed. In the very first sentence of the book, the narrator says that they are “the newest and least liked members of the colony.” Then patterns of violence start to occur, followed by the connections, if any, between these scenarios and the many characters. Many other queries are left unanswered until the final chapters, and some of them are never fully resolved, including the cliffhanger at the very end of the novel. For readers who enjoy subtle mysteries, these puzzles may be positive attributes. For others, they may create an anxiety that is never entirely placated. However, everyone will almost inevitably find themselves turning page after page in an effort to quench their curiosity, a mark of a strong novel.
Another strength of “The Parking Lot Attendant” is the interplay between characters. The narrator’s father is the only person who undergoes a significant deal of character development. However, all of the relationships in the book are significantly dynamic. Characters themselves undergo changes, and this provides a refreshing aspect to the story.
Together, these attributes create a solid work by Tamirat. The one qualm is the abundance of unanswered questions at the end of the book, which force the use of imagination. But would the audience rather have it any other way?

To the Editor:
I write to correct inaccuracies reported in the March 22 article “Admins Updating Q Guide to Allow Reporting of TF, Prof Misbehavior.”
The Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy formed a subcommittee in the fall of 2018 to review our course evaluations, known as the Q guide. The decision to undertake a review was prompted by the recognition that it has been more than 10 years since the last review, by awareness of the extensive research regarding student evaluations that has appeared in recent years, by faculty interest in improving the questions, and by the fact that the current technology supporting the Q is obsolete and replacing the tool provides an opportunity to think about the Q’s structure and content.
During its review, the subcommittee identified three main goals. First, making sure the Q allows students to provide feedback to course instructors on the quality of their instruction, while also enabling instructors to evaluate specific elements of the course. Second, making sure the Q provides needed information to students who may consider taking the course in the future. Third, providing information to department chairs and administrators to be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of the instructor.
At no time was there discussion of using the Q to allow students to report “inappropriate behavior by teaching staff” as it relates to Title IX or other breaches of professional standards. To be clear, Harvard has a dedicated group of professionals who are here for students, including the College’s and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences’s local Title IX Coordinators, the University Title IX Office, and the Office for Dispute Resolution. Staff members in the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response are also available to provide support and assistance.
What I shared with those in attendance at the March 21 town hall, in response to a question from the audience, was that the subcommittee was discussing adding a question to the Q about whether the teaching staff has created a welcoming environment conducive to learning. The intent of such a question would be to have students share their views on matters such as, “Are questions welcome?”, “Are you comfortable engaging in debate, where appropriate, or challenging assumptions?”, and so on. The question—should some form of it be included in a future version of the Q—is not intended to invite reports on breaches of professional conduct, as the Q is simply not the proper place for such reporting.
The subcommittee will continue discussion with different constituencies before finalizing its report to the Standing Committee.

In one sentence, clinical psychologist Jordan B. Peterson is a rising “media darling” who hates identity politics. According to New York Times columnist David Brooks, economist Tyler Cowen believes Peterson is “the most influential public intellectual in the modern world right now.” Peterson originally gained traction by publicly speaking against a Canadian law requiring the usage of preferred gender pronouns. He claims that current campus climates function on group identification, and that student insistence on intersectionality yields a logical conclusion of individualism, which contradicts the initial group assumption. Peterson also states that identity politics’ primary factors of distinction, race and gender, are arbitrary. The chapters of his book “12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos”—with seemingly apolitical titles such as “Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world”—alludes to a popular criticism that social proselytization arises too often from the unequipped and naïve.
This attack on identity politics—insistence that such frameworks are too indistinct, emotional, arbitrary, reductive, and divisive while being directed by people who are too young—drives current disillusionment with, criticism of, and mockery about the left. But this attack is a mischaracterization. Identity politics has undeniably stirred up political conversation by inundating it with intentional subjectivity, collective perspective, and bias identifications that Peterson himself describes as “post-modern.” The issue, however, is not that these additions are untrue or even invalid. It is that the inclusion of identity in political conversation provides more information than Peterson’s regressive individual-based framework can handle.
Overemphasis on the individual as a political entity is dangerous territory. Such underscoring of individualism suggests that collective action is simply the product of individual decisions, community well-being the sum of individual happiness, and governance an exogenous force unrelated to individual choice. Even in less extreme individualist doctrines, relative positions and consequent social dynamics between members of society are undermined. We often forget that our labor choices exist because of the labor of others. For example, Harvard students can pursue an immersive higher education experience because we do not make our own clothes, grow our own food, or create our own shelters. Similarly, we forget that the meaning of our labor is derived from the judgment of others. Committees, firms, and peers determine our value as workers. Because of this web of dependence, no political unit can be as simple as the individual; it must extend to collective units, such as households, neighborhoods, and social groups. The intimation that group identification cannot meaningfully inform politics is prone to ecological fallacy. Collectively, we correct for our individual blind spots, and simultaneously, a well-kept individual may not be a well-kept leader.
Identity politics depends on collectivism; community is its charm. It is based on shared experiences of minority groups who did not have the luxury of ignorance regarding a majority group’s actions. It is also an empowering force. Identity politics arms the marginalized with the power of self-definition, the irresistibility of a narrative. As critics have pointed out, this narrative veered towards self-victimization. The pain articulated, however, is real. Perhaps the true threat of leftist identity politics to the right is that it grants pain power; it creates a political currency oppressors cannot obtain. And there is no story more stunning than that of pain, especially when this pain is verifiable through incarceration rates, wage gap regressions, and death toll rates.
Peterson rightfully characterized this emphasis on collective pain as a “sleight of hand game” that provides minorities with seats at the table and currency in political conversation. It is much harder to prove that something exists than that it doesn’t; indeed, when the other party refuses to afford you a foundation, this task is of course impossible. In shaping political conversation through emotional contexts, minorities do not have to prove what they know and of what society at large refuses to acknowledge—that structural barriers to their economic and social success exist. But Peterson provides no argument for why such a strategy is suboptimal besides that its oppressed-oppressor framework mirrors that of Marxism. This argument, however, is dubious because we don’t live in binaries—not all government intervention is communist. Group identification is not always indicative of totalitarianism. We think in groups because we have been demonstrated consistently the blind spots, limitations, and biases of single individuals.
I have always believed that the mainstreaming of identity politics coincided with that of statistics intentionally. Group identity could not have been created without the tangibility of numbers. In some ways, journalist Joan Morgan’s 1999 manifesto of hip-hop feminism is a meditation on the statistic that 70 percent of black children were born to single parents. A Crimson article on gender disparities in the mathematics department includes a direct imbedding of the National Mathematics Survey’s 21 pages that quantitatively maps the phenomenon out. I wrote a column motivated by high STD rates among yellow American women. The existence of these motivating statistics is enough to show that divisions in identity politics are not arbitrary; an entity must have found these distinctions important enough to collect data on them before.
In statistics, a researcher finds a sample, eliminates the outliers, and uncovers a correlation. In identity politics, one finds a group, seeks a norm, and matches social trends. The rise of identity politics is a logical conclusion to a process of information generation that also seeks to generalize, reduce, and conclude; it is not the ideological regime intent on individual destruction that Peterson believes it is. Indeed, the statistical process is perhaps the only way we are able to contend with the large data our world produces. Of course, correlation doesn't equal causation. But further analysis, not retreat into individualism, will allow us to uncover social truths outside the constraints of our own blind spots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As someone who worked in New York City’s jails and prisons, including Rikers Island, through the Thrive for Life Prison Project, I expected to continue my work in this area when I arrived at Harvard by exploring ways to work within Boston’s penal system.
When I arrived in Cambridge, however, I came to the horrifying realization that what I experienced in dealing with America’s broken criminal justice system could also be found right in my backyard at Harvard. In fact, Harvard may not have cells and steel bars, but it harbors the same institutionalized social problems that American society does: A startling lack of opportunity for redemption and a lack of concern for those who make mistakes in our society.
***
One of the volunteers at Thrive for Life is the most scrumptious woman you’ll ever meet in your life. Her contradicting grandmother-like yet tween-ish attitude could throw anyone for a spin. When she’s not talking about Gottfrey, her dog, she chit-chats about the inmates we work with as a pastime.
She constantly tells stories of how she warns “the guys” to never plead guilty to a felony, at all costs—even if it means getting a new lawyer.
That is, until she realizes she’s lost Gottfrey and stops the conversation to find him.
Unfortunately, not every incarcerated individual has the help of a grandmotherly guru. Our nation’s public defenders are so overworked that over 90 percent of the time they convince their client to plead guilty to a lower offense, which is often a felony. In federal cases and in nearly half of all states, expungement—or deletion of a case in the eyes of the law—is not an option for those who plead to or are convicted of a felony as a legal adult (in four of these states, sealing, or removing the case from public view, is permitted under varying circumstances).
Without the option of expungement or sealing, felony convictions ruin formerly incarcerated individuals’ chances at successful reentry into society. In fact, formerly incarcerated individuals with a felony conviction can be barred from many federal professions, disenfranchised, unable to receive government aid, and are less likely to be employed due to false assumptions made by employers about their character. Indeed, a felony conviction on one’s record acts as the equivalent of a societal Scarlet Letter. It exerts an influence on every aspect of one’s life, even after one’s time has been served. This at least in part explains the United States’ astonishingly high recidivism rate, currently upwards of 75 percent five years after prisoners’ release.
Such a disgusting system can only exist due to a striking and malignant lack of concern for incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals that pervades our society.
That includes at Harvard.
When the History Department chose to admit one of the top scholars in the field of American Studies, Michelle Jones, their decision was overridden by the administration, according to internal memos and emails obtained by the Marshall Project, a news outlet that reports on criminal justice issues. Concerns were voiced about misrepresentation of her criminal record on her application. Still, this decision was made despite vocal support from her prosecutor, recommendations from renowned historians across the country, and her assertion that she would have talked more about her crime if she had been asked about it.
More importantly, if Harvard truly believed in human redemption, then Michelle Jones would have served her time. End of sentence. No amount of minimization of her crime would have harmed her application, since it should not have even been a factor. This is not the only way, however, that Harvard has demonstrated its indifference towards those in our society who have made mistakes.
Even within on-campus discipline, Harvard can irrevocably punish. Much like a felony for a formerly incarcerated individual that can never be sealed or expunged, a permanent notation on one’s academic record is considered an academic “kiss of death.” Since employers can often see these permanent notations, the future prospects of students are significantly harmed. 
All disciplinary forced withdrawals cause this notation to be marked on one’s transcript.  Furthermore, this notation cannot be removed under any circumstance—including a return to campus or eventual graduation.
There are ways to discipline students that don’t involve ruining the rest of their lives. Furthermore, even if forced withdrawal itself is not changed, the University could follow in the footsteps of Syracuse and allow the notation to be removed with the completion of a non-credit course.
Efforts to structurally reform the way the University disciplines students have seen limited success. After  removing academic dishonesty from the Administrative Board’s jurisdiction and giving it to the Honor Council, cases resulting in forced withdrawal have decreased from 20 percent to 16 percent between the two periods of 2013 to 2015 and  2015 to 2017.
Nevertheless, without the elimination of a culture that does not offer an opportunity for reconciliation, Harvard will always be a mirror of America’s broken criminal justice system.

Manhattan Detention Complex. It was just like every other Friday. I give in my ID. Guards, large automatic sliding doors, loud buzzes, alarms, occasional lockdowns. It’s all a part of the drill. We sit in a circle with the inmates participating in the program. It was just like every other Friday.
Except it was the Friday before Christmas.
We near the end of the session. I hear sniffles to my left that, in a painfully slow and heart-wrenching crescendo, become uncontrollable sobs. An inmate explains that he just wants to see his family. I put my hand on his shoulder, offering all that I could in the moment, even though both he and I knew I would have to leave in a few minutes.
Student or inmate, we’re all people.
We live.
We breathe.
We love.
We make mistakes.
Why can’t we just recognize that?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Each year, millions of hopeful students across the globe sharpen their No. 2 pencils and arrive at approved testing centers to sit for the ACT or SAT. Though all will emerge with scores assessing their mathematical ability and critical reading skills, only some will opt to also write the optional essay portion of the standardized test. And on March 19, the College announced that its applicants would no longer be required to submit the scores from that essay.
We are pleased that Harvard has decided to join the vast majority of colleges across the country and drop the SAT and ACT essay from application requirements. We believe that this decision will heighten the integrity of the admissions process while making Harvard accessible to a broader range of students, and we look forward to witnessing the impact that this will have on future Harvard classes.
In the past, we have repeatedly and strongly condemned the practice of standardized testing and the SAT in particular, for myriad reasons. However, we believe that the essay is perhaps even more variable than the other sections of the exam. While all test scores inevitably depend on a student’s mindset on testing day, the essay portion depends disproportionately on prior knowledge and is not an accurate predictor of writing success in college. This is even more true at colleges such as Harvard, where first-years must fulfill a mandatory writing requirement. The SAT functioned for decades without an essay component until 2005—we are glad that future Harvard applicants will no longer be forced to submit a score that is wont to misrepresent their ability.
Similarly, the essay’s fee was an unnecessary financial burden. Though fee waivers are available for domestic students who meet certain financial criteria, the fee still represents a barrier to others who fall just outside of this criteria. Furthermore, international students do not qualify for fee waivers unless they take the test on U.S. soil, unfairly disqualifying potential Harvard applicants who are unable to pay the additional cost.
In part as an effort to ensure that all applicants have equal opportunity to represent themselves well in the admissions process, we urge Harvard to carefully consider how it can ensure the integrity of students’ application essays now that this piece of writing is no longer required. In addition to their SAT or ACT essay scores, students are able to submit two additional essays in the Harvard application. The sad reality is that these essays are pitifully easy to fabricate—students with adequate resources presumably have no trouble submitting essays that they did not write, and Harvard ought to put in every effort to ensure that the applications that it accepts are truly representative of the applicants’ talents.
It is vital that, with this change, Harvard be transparent about whether or not students who submit their essay scores will be given any preference in the admissions process. Though the supplemental essay is billed as optional, many students feel that they will not be seriously considered unless they submit it. Especially in light of the aforementioned concerns around financial accessibility, Harvard should dispel these fears and genuinely disregard the essay score as an application component.
While we are glad that Harvard will join the more than 98 percent of colleges and universities in the United States that do not require these essay scores, we hope that the 28 remaining schools who still require the exam will soon make a similar change in admissions policy. The college application process is a stressful and challenging time, and any practice that will improve the accessibility of higher education as well as the truthfulness of the applications themselves ought to be a common one.

UPDATED: March 26, 2018 at 2:50 p.m.
Harvard last month completed the steel framework of the “District Energy Facility,” a building located on Harvard-owned land in Allston that will supply electricity and hot and cold water to the University’s nearby $1 billion School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex.
The energy facility, designed by architecture firm Leers Weinzapfel Associates Architects and located behind the SEAS complex, will span 58,000-square feet, according to the website for Harvard’s Office for Sustainability . The building will feature seven stories of classrooms and laboratories; and is slated for completion in summer 2020.
The topping off ceremony—during which construction workers placed the final steel beam on the building—took place in Feb. 2018.
A spokesperson for Harvard Energy & Utilities, the University office overseeing the construction of the district energy facility, wrote in a 2018 posting on the University's sustainability website that Harvard and Leers Weinzapfel Associates Architects are working to build a “lower-carbon, climate resistant, and highly efficient district energy facility.”
The spokesperson, Colin B. Durrant, wrote in the posting that the SEAS complex—in part due to the district energy facility—will be “one of the most energy-efficient laboratory buildings of its size.”
According to the posting, the facility will include a 1.3-million-gallon tank of cold water that will be used to cool the SEAS complex in a “cheaper and less-polluting” manner. This tank, which—when constructed—will comprise the largest thermostat storage facility in Massachusetts, will use electricity to cool the water contained in the tank at off-peak hours.
The system functions much like a massive battery storing energy.
Doug Garron, the managing director of Harvard’s Campus Services Energy and Facilities, wrote in an emailed statement last week that the district energy facility will boast “reliability, resiliency, and efficiency.”
“Providing heating, cooling, and electricity is an important part of supporting the University’s leading-edge research and teaching,” Garron wrote. “The new facility is designed to be flexible so that it can adapt to changes in technology, helping Harvard meet its long-term sustainability goals.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarifications:
CORRECTION: March 26, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the architectural firm that designed the district energy facility is Behnisch Architekten. In fact, Leers Weinzapfel Associates Architects designed the facility.
CORRECTION: March 26, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly contextualized a quote from Colin B. Durrant's posting. When Durrant wrote the building would be “one of the most energy-efficient laboratory buildings of its size," he was referring to the SEAS complex, not the district energy facility.
CLARIFICATION: March 26, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated Colin B. Durrant's posting about the district energy facility is hosted on Harvard's Office for Sustainability website. To clarify, the posting is hosted on Harvard's sustainability website, which includes the work of the office for sustainability.

Around 20 Harvard affiliates protested the appearance of Seth A. Klarman—CEO of Baupost Group—at a Harvard Business School event Saturday morning, urging the University to divest from Baupost given its nearly $1 billion share in Puerto Rican bonds.
Klarman served a keynote speaker for the day-long Business School Investment Conference, which took place in Spangler Center.  The ticketed event was hosted by the Investment Club, a Business School student organization. The Baupost Group is listed as one of the sponsors for the event.
Protesters waiting outside Spangler along Batten Way called on Baupost—which holds $931 million of Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt—to cancel its holdings in Puerto Rican bonds and demanded Harvard divest $2 billion from Baupost.
At approximately 8:30 a.m., demonstrators attempted to enter the west side of Spangler, but security guards stopped them, arguing the protest would disrupt the conference.
One of the protestors, Agustin A. Rodriguez Lopez ’19, spoke to the gathering about his family’s experiences in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria last September. The hurricanes, which struck within a period of two weeks, shut off 80 percent of the island’s power lines and left thousands without access to potable water.
“I was raised in Puerto Rico, I lived there my entire life. There is not anyone who I know who is not affected somehow by the situation,” Rodriguez Lopez said. “It’s hard to see the blue tarps set up by the engineer corps and not feel something.”
A spokesperson from Baupost group said Baupost has not purchased additional Puerto Rican debt since the hurricanes last September. In a letter to clients in Oct. 2017, Klarman wrote that “holders should be willing to accept a discount to par as part of a broader restructuring of the island’s excessive debt burden.”
“This is a terrible tragedy caused by a once in a lifetime storm and our first thoughts have consistently been with the people of the island,” Klarman wrote in an emailed statement in January.
Rhonda N. Shafei, a Harvard Business School student and the co-chair of the Investment Conference, declined to comment on the protest.
Joseph Quisol, a student at the Graduate School of Education, acknowledged the rally took place the same day as the March for Our Lives—a nation-wide, student-led protest aimed at curbing gun violence—but said the demonstration “stood in solidarity” with the separate, national event.  Quisol said the goal of the march was “to get as many people as possible to know that our investment and our endowment is perpetuating colonialism and injustice.”
“If we don’t continue being vocal and putting pressure [on the University]... things don’t get done,” said Quisol.
Sarah E. Baver, a student at the Graduate School of Education, said she learned about the event through organizers.
“I wanted to come in solidarity,” she said. “As a Harvard student, I think it is critical to stand against injustice, to see the ways in which my own affiliation with the Ed School is connected to injustice that is certainly being perpetuated against Puerto Rican people.”
In January, hundreds of protesters marched through campus similarly calling on Harvard Management Company–the stewards of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—to divest $2 billion from Baupost Group.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With fewer than two months remaining in the spring semester, Harvard juniors studying arts and humanities-related concentrations are gearing up to submit their senior thesis proposals.
These thesis proposals are meant to outline students’ plans for their senior thesis, which eligible undergraduates will complete next spring. English, history of art and architecture, linguistics, history and literature, and music concentrators will all need to submit the proposals, meant to track junior-year progress toward the final goal.
In the English department, students may choose to write a critical thesis, a creative thesis, or no thesis at all. This Wednesday marks the deadline for proposals for critical theses, which take the form of a piece of analytical writing. Inspired by his work in virtual reality at the Harvard Innovation Labs, English concentrator Connor S. Doyle ’19 said he will submit a proposal that examines the “the intersection of the virtual and literature.”
“Literature can make time work in different ways,” Doyle said. “[I’m looking at] how texts in literature are able to conjure reality or virtual worlds that are more sophisticated and have different rules of time and space than our world where realities can exist in superpositions or like layers rather than linearly.”
Doyle, who wrote his proposal last week, said he feels “really prepared” for his thesis.
Music concentrators have the option to propose either a written thesis or a composition thesis to their department by April 2. Haden F. Smiley ’19, a joint concentrator in music and romance languages and literatures, said he will submit a written thesis proposal.
“I have to do a project that is at the intersection of the two fields, and mine is an ethnographic study of American country music festivals in Italy,” Smiley said. “International country music isn’t a topic in musicology or ethnomusicology that’s covered widely.”
Smiley said he is not very stressed about his proposal. He explained that, in both departments to which he belongs, he is currently taking junior tutorials—courses that in part seek to prepare students for senior theses—that have been helpful in keeping him on track.
Mateo A. Lincoln ’19, a joint concentrator in music and comparative literature, is currently completing a junior thesis for comparative literature on the 20th century Ballets Russes in relation to the French novelist’s Proust’s work. For his senior thesis, he said he is thinking of adapting a text into a libretto for an opera or musical. The process might involve translation, he said.
“I feel like I’ve been on the other end a lot of musicals. I’ve been conducting them and teaching music and things like that, but I would love to be on the first end of composition,” Lincoln said.
While history and literature concentrators do not need to submit a thesis proposal until the fall, the students do have to submit a junior essay at the start of April. Director of Studies in History and Literature Lauren Kaminsky said she thinks this system gives students the “core skills” they need to write a successful thesis.
Susie A. Clements ’19, a history and literature concentrator, said the junior essay acts as a “practice or mock” for the senior thesis. She said she is writing about the original TV series  GLOW, which centers on female wrestlers. Clements added her actual thesis still feels “ages away.”
Marina F. Felix ’19, a history of art and architecture concentrator, said she will submit her thesis proposal by April 16. Inspired by a golden age Spanish painting class she took, she will be analyzing Spanish baroque paintings. Felix will look at how “vision and sight interact with science” and possibly with religion, too.
The history of art and architecture junior concentrators held a meeting last week about theses, and Felix described the students at the meeting as “smiling,” “nervous,” and “sarcastically laughing.”
“It takes a village to raise a thesis,” Felix said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As its student body grows more diverse, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will continue to prioritize diversity initiatives, Dean of SEAS Francis J. Doyle III said earlier this month.
In a March interview, Doyle said he was “extremely passionate” about a number of SEAS recent diversity initiatives, including a recently created committee on diversity, inclusion and belonging.
Appointed in 2017, the committee has worked in “parallel” to the the University-wide Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, which University president Drew G. Faust formed in 2016.
SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff said the committee or its subcommittees meet “on a weekly basis.”
According to Doyle, the SEAS committee is entirely composed of volunteer “stakeholders, undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs, staff, faculty.” Doyle said he wanted to make clear that diversity was not the sole “responsibility of the underrepresented.”
“Quite frankly, I wanted to see, and I pointed my finger at some of the faculty, I wanted to see the white men in there helping out, making sure we're doing the right thing, changing the landscape, moving the needle to use a different metaphor, so that we really are advancing the goals that we espouse,” he said.
“It's one thing for a dean to tell a faculty member to join a committee, but when the students start queuing up, and the undergrads, the grads, the postdocs, master students too are all passionate and participating in this as well, we really have all the stakeholders in place,” Doyle added.
Doyle said that, though the committee is in its “early days,” it has already begun to raise thoughtful questions.
“There's nothing I'm gonna report yet that we're going to tackle,” he said. “But they're creating a list, and we're gauging impact, gauging what resources required, and rolling out initiatives that would make sense.”
Another initiative Doyle mentioned is the push to establish additional infrastructure and support via student groups. Three affinity groups, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, established chapters at Harvard in the past year.
“When I got here, I was absolutely shocked that we didn’t have Society of Women Engineers, National Society of Black Engineers, or Society of Hispanic and Professional Engineers,” Doyle said. “We found a way to do it where we sponsor it from within SEAS because I felt those groups were crucial to take root and have an anchor within SEAS to support our students.”
Just last week, Doyle spoke at a panel discussion centering on “challenges and issues” of diversity in engineering at the National Society of Black Engineers national convention.
Doyle also praised a number of previously existing diversity initiatives, including a graduate recruiting committee for students from underrepresented groups, student organizations like Women in Computer Science, and a National Science Foundation-sponsored summer research program for undergraduates.
“Some of them might apply to Harvard for grad school eventually, some of the people go to other places. But it’s our part to help ensure that we're bridging the pipeline in terms of diversity,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A federal judge ruled last month that former associate professor Kimberly S. Theidon failed to prove Harvard violated Title IX policies in denying her tenure.
The decision comes three years after Theidon initially filed her lawsuit in March 2015, claiming the University denied her tenure in May 2013 due to her advocacy on behalf of those who have suffered sexual assault. U.S. District Judge Leo T. Sorokin wrote in an order dismissing the case on Feb. 28 that Theidon did not prove Harvard discriminated against her on the basis of gender or that the University retaliated against her for her stances on sexual assault.
Harvard spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “pleased” with the ruling.
“This decision affirms that Harvard’s tenure decision was based solely on the merits of her candidacy," Cowenhoven wrote.
Philip J. Gordon, Theidon’s lawyer, said he and Theidon plan on filing an appeal to the decision.
“We are, of course, disappointed in the judge’s ruling, but new details are finally emerging, and we will be appealing,” Gordon said.
During the trial, Theidon, who specializes in Latin American studies, said Government Professor and Latin American Studies Scholar Jorge I. Dominguez discouraged her from filing a suit in July 2013 after she received news of her tenure denial, as recorded in a court order from May 2017.
“Yes, I do,” Theidon said when asked if she had notes from her meetings with Dominguez. “He told me not to file a grievance, not to pursue a suit, not to set precedent, to go to [Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity] Judith Singer, see if they’d forgive my mortgage and solve it all with a handshake.”
The Chronicle of Higher Education reported in February that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of sexual misconduct. Following the reports, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith placed Dominguez on paid administrative leave while the University investigates the sexual harassment allegations against him. A week later, Dominguez announced he was stepping down from all administrative positions immediately and retiring from teaching at the end of the semester. Dominguez is on sabbatical this semester.
In the court record, Theidon said she approached Dominguez for advice because he had previously commended her scholarly work and had helped her apply for tenure.
“He had given me some advice on the research statement, because I couldn’t get anyone to explain to me what the tenure research statement should look like,” she said. “And he told me my great, my scholarly contributions, et cetera, so he seemed like someone that I should go back to after the tenure denial, because I was trying to figure out for myself what had happened.”
Though Theidon ultimately was not able to produce the notes she mentioned in court, Sorokin ruled that she should instead produce a quarter-page summary of the event.
Dominguez did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday afternoon.
In her suit, Theidon alleged the University's decision to deny her tenure was unfairly influenced by her complaints—made to at least one dean and one professor— about the disparate treatment of women in her department.
Theidon also claimed Harvard denied her tenure in retaliation for comments she made a March 2013 Crimson article about sexual harassment at Harvard. In that story, she defended anonymous sexual assault victims also quoted in the report. Theidon has previously said in interviews with the Crimson that, prior to publication of the 2013 article, she received multiple indications she was likely to earn tenure.
Harvard’s actions, Theidon claimed, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, both of which prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender.
Harvard argued Theidon had instead not received tenure because she failed to publish research articles in top anthropology journals and because her new projects at the time were “essentially more of the same.”
Theidon filed a charge against Harvard in March 2014 with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination. She withdrew the complaint a few months later so she could file a suit at the federal level.
In 2015, Theidon was granted tenure at Tufts University, where she is currently a professor of international humanitarian studies.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: Monday, March 26 at 9:35 p.m. 
Flanked by security guards and an armored vehicle, Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his entourage descended on Harvard Saturday evening to discuss higher education with Boston-area university leaders and faculty.
Prince Mohammed specifically requested to visit Harvard during his multi-week tour of the United States, University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an email.
Boston is one of several U.S. cities the crown prince is visiting to court investors to back his economic and social reforms, changes aimed at reducing Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil.
While at Harvard, Prince Mohammed participated in two private roundtable conversations at the University's faculty club—one with Harvard professors who focus on Saudi Arabia and other areas pertinent to the reforms he outlined in his Saudi Vision 2030 document, according to Vice Provost of International Affairs Mark C. Elliott.
Elliott said research universities and startups in the area drew Prince Mohammed to Cambridge.
“He’s very interested in the connection between research, entrepreneurship and innovation and how they fit together to fuel the economy,” Elliott added.
The second event involved presidents of local universities and colleges, who spoke about higher education and technology-related education. University President Drew G. Faust could not attend because of a prior commitment, according to deLuzuriaga, but Provost Alan M. Garber “greeted the prince and facilitated the discussions.”
Elliott said the conversation was more abstract than it was policy-focused.
“There was no discussion of particular areas of reform in education or anything else for that matter,” Elliott said.
Elliott also said the crown prince mostly listened to the commentary during the meetings, rather than sharing his own thoughts.
“He really spent 90 percent of the time simply listening and making polite but limited responses to what he was hearing,” Elliott said.
During the meeting, the prince said he was impressed by what he saw at Harvard. He also said he shared the concerns of some speakers about the need to prepare young people for jobs that do not yet exist.
Prince Mohammed visited MIT for a forum entitled “Innovation to Impact” earlier Saturday, where dozens of protesters criticized Saudi actions in Yemen, according to The Tech, MIT’s newspaper. An online petition calling for MIT to cancel his invitation amassed more than 6,000 signatures.
Harvard did not widely publicize the crown prince’s visit prior to his arrival in Cambridge and Prince Mohammed did not participate in any public events on campus.
Prince Mohammed met with U.S. President Donald Trump a few days prior to his arrival at Harvard. At that meeting, Trump vowed to assist the crown prince in executing a long-stalled arms deal between the two countries.
Prince Mohammed's tour comes in the wake of controversies surrounding  the crown prince's ascent to power, especially his alleged purging of possible challengers to his rule, including members of the royal family.
Harvard has a history of ties to the Saudi royal family. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal gave $20 million to Harvard in 2005, prompting the University to establish the Alwaleed Islamic Studies Program and to endow three professorships in his name. Those professorships are held by Divinity School Professor Ousmane Kane, art historian David Roxburgh, and religious studies scholar Malika Zeghal.
Prince Mohammed imprisoned Alwaleed, his cousin, in the fall for several months.
A heavy security presence accompanied the crown prince during his Cambridge visit Saturday evening. Nearly 30 security vehicles and roughly 10 motorcycles lined Quincy St., which security officials kept closed to vehicle traffic for more than an hour while the crown prince remained inside the faculty club. An armored tactical vehicle also parked next to the Barker Center on Prescott St.
Police briefly closed the sidewalk near the faculty club before Prince Mohammed's exit. Shortly after 7 p.m., dozens of onlookers snapped photos of the crown prince and his entourage as security personnel whisked him out of the building and into a waiting car—and at least one waiting  bag of Tasty Burger.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 26, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman requested to meet with Harvard faculty and administrators. In fact, he only requested to visit Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 100 Harvard students attended Boston’s iteration of the "March for Our Lives" protest on Saturday, joining an estimated crowd of 50,000 people in a nationwide movement pushing for stricter gun control.
The March for Our Lives protests—spurred by activism from student survivors of last month’s deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Fla.—took place in more than 800 major cities worldwide over the weekend.  Thirteen Harvard student groups, including the Phillips Brooks House Association, the Harvard College Democrats, and the Harvard Black Students’ Association, sponsored a contingent of Harvard affiliates who attended the march.
“Obviously the initial reaction to Parkland and any school shooting is one of indignation and horror, and the next reaction has to be a response,” said Zachary D. Steigerwald Schnall ’21, who helped organize the event. “We’ve seen so many school shootings happen, and particularly in Boston, where we haven’t seen any school shootings, we’ve seen gun violence happen at a systemic level for decades.”
“Our march is very much focused on identifying where gun violence originates in our city and figuring out the best community solutions and policies that could address this form of gun violence,” he added.
Chanting slogans like “Enough is enough,” and “Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go,” protesters gathered at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in Roxbury before marching up Columbus Ave. to rally at Boston Common. The rally comprised speeches, spoken word poetry, and music. A significant number of children participated in the protest, including a toddler in a stroller who hosited a sign reading, “Binkies not bullets.”
One student who attended the march, Alec J. Fischthal ’21, said he was partially motivated to participate after hearing student survivors from the shooting in Parkland speak at an Institute of Politics forum last week.
“Just hearing them speak, and their ability to transcend the tragedy that happened to them in order to make a bigger, more impactful change across the country, was really inspiring,” he said. “And I felt personally that I had to go out, and if I didn’t then that would be complicity in the whole system.”
Sarah Canny, co-chair of the Harvard Kennedy School Democratic Caucus, said her organization got involved to amplify the national March for Our Lives platform—not in an effort to seek immediate legislative change in Massachusetts.
“Massachusetts is much more progressive than other states in terms of gun legislation, but this is looking at the national level, saying these are common sense, comprehensive gun control legislation that, if we were to implement them on the federal level, we’d have states looking a lot more like Massachusetts,” Canny said. “We’d love this to turn into an actual policy accomplishment down the road, but as of Saturday it’s just coming together behind this.”
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said he marched because the goals of the protest align with Democratic policy objectives.
“We’ve been having discussions about how we can be involved in sharing our voice in the debate for gun control,” he said. “It made sense for us to be able to use our bodies in the space closest to us, so getting involved with the march in Boston.”
Freeland added he felt the atmosphere of the march differed from other protests he had attended in the past.
“I think there was a dedication and a commitment and a resolution, but also, there were times when it felt very somber. Unlike other marches I had been to, like the Women’s March for example, I think there were some moments of desperation that I felt while marching,” he said.
Both Fischthal and Freeland said they hope the movement for gun control will continue beyond the march and will ultimately be reflected in upcoming elections and in legislation.
“[The organizers] were stressing voter registration very heavily,” Fischthal said.  “I think the next logical step of this is to take this movement and turn it into an electoral movement.”
Steigerwald Schnall also said he thinks political engagement from America's youth will be key to increasing public awareness of gun violence in Boston.
“Youth are the future, but they’re also the present,” he said. “We have a voice, and it’s important that we make our voices heard now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 26, 2018 at 6:50 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to expand its new bicycle subsidy program after close to 200 students signed up for the program in under one week.
The initiative, to which the Council allocated $3,000 at last week’s meeting, provides some low-income students with a $50 subsidy to spend on bicycles, scooters, and skateboards. To qualify for the subsidy, undergraduates must be eligible for the Student Events Fund, which allows students with demonstrated financial need to attend campus events free of charge.
According to Student Life Committee Chair Arnav Agrawal ’20, a Crimson comper, 60 students signed up for the subsidy within two hours of its debut and, by the end of the week, 178 had signed up.
“We believe that this is fundamentally very, very important,” Agrawal said. “These bicycles will act as physical evidence, as physical manifestations, of this Council’s belief that being first-gen or low-income on this campus should never be a burden.”
The legislation was primarily driven and sponsored by Pforzheimer House Representative Rainbow Yeung ’19, an inactive Crimson blog editor. According to Elm Yard Representative Emma L. Robertson ’21, Yeung acted as the “architect and leader of the legislation.”
Winthrop House Representative Evan M. Bonsall ’19 proposed an amendment expanding the program to Mather and Dunster Houses. Last week’s legislation only funded subsidies for undergraduates living in the Quad, the Dudley Co-Op, and off-campus housing.
“Dunster and Mather are just about as far away from most buildings where people have class as the Quad are,” Bonsall said. “And I think that it’s only fair that we offer the same benefit to... low-income students, students that are eligible for SEF, as we are providing to students in the Quad.”
The amended legislation would spend three of the UC’s $3,000 “burst packs” on additional subsidies for bicycle purchases.
Some representatives pushed back, though, arguing that including River Houses could jeopardize the program’s financial stability.
“I think the slippery slope argument actually does really apply here,” Eliot House Representative Taylor D. Marquis ’18 said. “Dunster is just across the street from the Lev[erett] towers, so I don’t see how that 20 feet makes any difference.”
“I think that right now we need to focus on the students in the Quad,” he added.
UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20 raised concerns about adding three burst packs of funding to the program before asking administrators to consider footing some of the cost.
“We bring it to life and then once it succeeds, we say listen, this is something that is succeeding: instead of pouring money into random things, pour some money into this,” Khoury said.
The amendment ultimately passed 21-12.
Agrawal added that Crimson Bikes, a local bicycle store, has shown interest in partnering with the Council to further reduce the price of bikes for qualifying students.
Also at the meeting, the Council voted to provide $3,500 for an event called “Can We Reconcile Justice and Forgiveness?” that will focus on “institutional justice and personal forgiveness.” The event will feature a victim of Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics coach who was sentenced in January to 40 to 175 years in Michigan state prison after pleading guilty to sexual assault.
The funding will come out of the UC’s $30,000 “Grant for an Open Harvard College,” which seeks to promote student-driven programs that fall under one of the Council’s “compelling interests” of mental health, sexual assault and harassment, race relations, and social spaces.
UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 also said at the meeting that he is working with administrators to try to increase funding for the Council’s Finance Committee.
The committee, which currently doles out $300,000 to eligible student groups, has faced a budget shortfall throughout the semester. Last week, with a 43 percent across-the-board grant cut looming, the Council voted to allocate $6,000 from its Emergency Fund to help shore up the committee’s budget.
“We are currently talking with the administration to try and figure out what we can do for subsequent years,” Boucher said. “The idea is that would alleviate some of the financial stressors that have been placed on [the committee].”

UPDATED: March 26, 2018 at 3:10 p.m.
The cost of attendance for Harvard College will be $67,580 for the 2018-2019 academic year, an increase of about 3 percent—or $1,971—from the previous year, Harvard announced Monday morning.
Next year’s cost of attendance includes $46,340 for tuition, which also marks a 3 percent increase over the 2017-2018 fee. The more than $20,000 in other charges covers fees, room, and board. The Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, sets tuition charges each year.
The average cost of attendance—that is, tuition, fees, room, and board—for an undergraduate at an American four-year private university was $44,820 for the 2017-2018 school year, according to the College Board. The College Board also reported that the in-state cost of attendance at a four-year public university was $18,390.
Last year, the cost of enrollment at the College rose by 4.1 percent—marking the largest percent increase since the 2008 economic downturn.
The rise in the College’s “sticker price” follows a long-term trend of annual increases in the cost of a Harvard education. The inflation-adjusted price rose 31 percent between 1998 and 2015, according to a 2015 Chronicle of Higher Education report. Harvard’s total cost of attendance first rose above $40,000 in 2005, above $50,000 in 2010, and above $60,000 in 2015.
The cost of attendance has increased at a faster rate than inflation; growth in consumer prices has hovered around 2 percent for the past year. The median family income in the United States rose by 3.2 percent to reach $59,039 in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Many College students, however, pay significantly less than the sticker price to attend Harvard. The majority of undergraduates receive some form of financial aid, and 20 percent of students—those coming from families earning less than $65,000 per year— pay nothing.
With the exception of Columbia, Harvard is the last university of the Ivy League to announce its tuition charges for next year. Of these universities, Harvard’s cost of tuition for the 2018-2019 year is the lowest.
The Harvard Gazette announced the University expects to spend more than $195 million on financial aid next year. Since the 2005 launch of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, the College has distributed more than $1.8 billion in grants to students with financial need.
The College will release regular decision admission results for the Class of 2022 on March 28.
This article has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 26, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated that Harvard students on full financial aid pay nothing toward the cost of tuition. In fact, these students pay nothing at all.

Kicking off the spring season, Harvard women’s golf traveled south to escape the New England cold in its opening match of 2018 in South Carolina. The Crimson was unable to recover from its tough start and finished last in a competitive field of 15.
The Clemson Invitational featured a whopping five teams ranked in the top 25 in the NCAA, with the victory going to Furman. The Paladins shot an impressive 30 under par—10 strokes ahead of second-place Michigan State—and registered a weekend-best 273 in the second round of the tournament.
Harvard fell behind the stiff competition early, registering a 307 in the opening round of the invitational. Although unable to climb up in the leaderboard following the first day of the competition, the Crimson improved throughout the weekend, scoring a 305 and a 301 in the second and third rounds, respectively.
Junior Anna Zhou was the top finisher for Harvard at tied for 57th, shooting 10 over par on the weekend. Zhou started the tournament on a strong note, shooting even on her first nine holes of the contest. Zhou consistently kept up her solid play, finishing at three over par, three over par, and four over par in each of her rounds.
Sophomore Chloe Belle Hooton made her first appearance of the Crimson’s 2017-2018 campaign in the spring opener at Clemson.
Following a tough start with a pair of six over par scores in the first round and a seven over par to begin the second day, Hooton settled in nicely to finish out her second round even par on the second half of the day. On Sunday, Hooton came out firing, riding a trio of birdies to shoot only one over par on the day, one of only two Harvard golfers to shoot one over par on an entire round. Hooton shot one under par on the first half of her Sunday round, the best finish on the back nine for a Crimson golfer and the best third round for the team.
The other one over par round in the tournament belonged to junior Michelle Xie with Saturday’s second round. Xie’s stellar round included shooting two under par on the front nine, the best nine-hole score for Harvard.
The second round was sandwiched in between an up-and-down weekend for Xie. The roller coaster of a weekend saw intense highs, such as starting the tournament with a string of eight straight pars sparked by an early birdie, and tough lows, including a twelve over par final round. However, Xie and Hooton led their squad with seven birdies each.
Although the Crimson finished at the bottom of the crowded field of competitors, it looks to use the Clemson Invitational as the 2018 opener to get ready to jump right into the all-important spring season.
Following the end of a five year tenure as the champions of the Ivy League, Harvard hopes to finish atop the Ancient Eight come April and avenge its loss to the reigning champions, Princeton.
Before competing for the conference championship, Harvard will host its Harvard Invitational in Florida in its last match before attempting to reclaim the league title.

The Harvard men’s golf team started its spring season off at the Furman Intercollegiate Tournament in Greensboro, S.C., finishing 15th out of 21 teams. No. 28 North Florida finished off the three-day tournament on top while No. 10 South Carolina finished tied for fourth. Fellow Ivy competitors Dartmouth and Yale both finished above the Crimson.
After a week of practice in sunny Palm Springs, Harvard, which had not played in a tournament since October of last year, travelled to South Carolina for their season’s inaugural tournament. Because of the natural circumstances—Boston in the winter—the team, before its Spring Break trip to California, had been practicing exclusively inside, lifting, running, and working on technique.
By the end of the weekend, the rust that the team had accrued over the last few months was clear to see. On the first day of the tournament, Friday, the weather was ideal for play. Harvard stumbled through the first round, finishing the day off in 11th, which would prove to be its highest finish all weekend.
Saturday also brought favorable playing conditions, but the Crimson did not improve on its score from the day before. In fact, its score remained the same (301) in all three rounds played. Unfortunately for the Crimson, other teams saw their scores improve from the first to second day, which meant Harvard finished day two in 16th.
Sunday’s weather was all but ideal, as the cold came in with the wind, and players wore as many as five layers. After six hours of play on this freezing course, Harvard again remained consistent in regards to its previous score and managed to move up from 16th to 15th. Though the performance of the team was not up to standard, it was not a wholly unsuccessful weekend, especially given the lack of match experience that the team has had since last fall.
Sophomore Rij Patel shot a score of 71 in the last round, and though he finished tied 48th overall, he had the eighth best performance on Sunday out of 123 competitors.
His teammates were impressed with his display, though it was something not completely unexpected.
“He has really been working hard to maintain form since the end of the fall season,” junior Aurian Capart said. “He looked great in Palm Springs and I was happy that he was able to play at a high level, especially today.”
Senior captain Greg Royston also had a quietly efficient weekend, tying his sophomore teammate at 48th overall. Though he did not have a standout round, he shot consistently all weekend long.
Individual performances aside, this weekend, and the tournaments to come all serve as preparation and practice for the Ivy League Tournament.
“This weekend we figured out what we need to improve on. We had some good things going on as well,” freshman Grant Fairbairn said.
The team travel to Princeton in two weeks for its next tournament, one in which the Crimson has often thrived in.
“The team is looking forward to Princeton,” Capart said. “We want to show improvement, and get sharper day by day. We need to get rid of the rust.”
After a tough first spring weekend, Harvard will continue to march on, attempting to claim the Ivy League title for a third consecutive year.

The No. 24 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team is not intimidated by high stakes.
This season, the Crimson beat out then-No. 10 Arizona State at the Sun Devils’ home pool, dominated Yale and Princeton to close out an undefeated campaign, and maintained an early lead to take home a second Ivy League championship in as many years over a strong field.
This week, Harvard (9-0, 6-0 Ivy) once again rose to the occasion, this time on the biggest stage of all. The Crimson traveled to Minneapolis for the 2018 NCAA Championships and picked up eight All-America accolades en route to an 18th-place finish to close out its season.
The result is a significant improvement over last year, when Harvard finished in 27th at the meet. It also sees the Crimson place ahead of a number of highly ranked programs, including No. 8 Arizona State, No. 13 Missouri, and No. 19 Notre Dame. Cornell was the next highest finisher from the Ancient Eight, coming away as the nation’s 23rd-best team.
“I think that the team did very well overall at the meet,” senior Paul O’Hara said. “Our 18th-place finish is the highest we've had in some time, and we were all really happy to be able to hold our own against so many top programs. We were happy to be able to perform at the same level that we did at Ivy League Championships in such a high stakes environment.”
Harvard’s top-20 finish came on the back of a standout performance from sophomore Dean Farris, who collected six All-America honors, including two first-team recognitions. The Atlanta, Ga. Native also broke a solo team record in the 50-yard freestyle before helping the 800 freestyle relay squad to set another new-best mark.
“Dean did a great job of helping the team to get as many points as we did,” co-captain Luke Morgan-Scott said. “This year he definitely started making a real impact in a wider variety of events. He had a lot of swims throughout the meet, which would break most guys down a lot, but he was able to find a way to get himself into some big finals for all of his swims.”
In the 800 free relay, the first event of the meet, Farris and the Crimson set the tone for the rest of the NCAA Championships. The Harvard lineup of Farris, junior Brennan Novak, freshman Mahlon Reihman, and sophomore Zach Snyder cruised to an 11th-place finish, outpacing two squads from top-10 programs en route to a program record time. Farris’ leg of the relay was the second fastest of the event, just .02 seconds behind Indiana senior and Olympic gold medalist Blake Pieroni’s.
Farris would face Pieroni again in the 200-yard freestyle. The Crimson sophomore vied for a spot in the top three through the first 100 yards, but the star-studded opposition surged towards the end, and Farris ended up touching the wall sixth. The five finishers ahead of him included two Olympic gold medalists, one of whom won with a new NCAA record time, and a World Championships gold medalist.
The result earned Farris first team All-America honors, an award that he would double up on by the end of the next day. In the 200-yard backstroke, the standout sophomore ended up seventh with a time of 1:40.37.
The Atlanta, Ga., Native would also earn honorable mention All-America recognition in the 50 freestyle, touching the wall 12th overall in 19.28 seconds. Farris’ time smashed a five-year-old Harvard record by nearly a quarter of a second.
The sophomore’s final two All-America awards came in a pair of relay events. Farris teamed up with O’Hara, sophomore Raphael Marcoux, and senior Steven Tan for the 200 medley relay, and the lineup finished in 16th place, good for honorable mention All-America honors.
The same group also raced in the 200-yard freestyle relay, bettering their finish from the medley relay to end up in 13th, just .21 seconds behind 12th-place Tennessee. The lineup’s qualifying time of 1:16.66 eclipses the previous program record by nearly a full second.
In the final event of the meet, the 400 freestyle relay, Marcoux, Reihman, Farris, and O’Hara clocked a mark of 2:52.97, a second-and-a-half off of their time at Ivy League Championships, to grab a 22nd-place result.
The Crimson also benefited from some strong performances in the distance events, with juniors Logan Houck and Brennan Novak securing three honorable mention All-America honors between them.
“Logan and Brennan did super well,” co-captain Bobby Ross said. “The distance group really stepped up this year and they quickly turned into our most reliable events. It’s great to see them perform so well after a season of such hard work.”
Novak and Houck collected 14th and 16th-place results, respectively, in the 500-yard freestyle. Novak finished just .08 seconds behind the next-fastest swimmer, while Houck touched the wall two seconds later in 4:17.66. Houck would collect another honorable mention honor in the 1650 free, ending up in 15th place. Novak finished up nine seconds behind in a close field, good for 25th overall.
Tan also competed in two solo events. The senior finished 45th in the prelims of the 50 freestyle and had the 24th-fastest time in the 100 back qualifiers, narrowly missing out on a spot in the finals.
Overall, the Crimson’s performance at this year’s NCAA Championships will go a long way towards establishing Harvard as a nationally competitive program. Beating out a number of top-25 ranked programs in the team points will give the Crimson confidence as it heads into next season, as will the fact that all but two of the team’s NCAA qualifiers are returning for the coming campaign.
“We've been working towards having more of a presence on the national level, and a top-20 finish is an incredible sign of things to come for our team,” Morgan-Scott said. “We have a great group of guys next year, especially with our incoming freshmen class, so I'm excited to see what's possible. I can only imagine the guys are going to be even more hungry next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four days after a thrilling shootout with Boston University, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team took the field at Harvard Stadium against Dartmouth for a game that was a much different affair. With improved defensive intensity from the Crimson as well as its opponents, both squads struggled to find clear cut chances, especially early on in the contest.
The two sides entered halftime with the Big Green holding on to a narrow 5-4 lead, and Harvard having mustered just nine shots on goal through 30 minutes of play.
A slower-paced game did not mean that the finish was any less tense, however, as the teams found themselves in an 8-8 deadlock after Dartmouth sophomore attackman Ben Martin found the back of the net with 9:53 remaining in the final quarter. For the next few minutes, the game became a battle between the two goalies, with the Big Green’s George Christopher and the Crimson’s Robert Shaw both making key saves to keep the game tied.
As he has done all season long for Harvard, however, senior attackman Morgan Cheek stepped up to direct the offense down the stretch. From the X, he found freshman Kyle Salvatore for the game-winning goal with 5:57 to go, and sophomore Kyle Anderson for the game-icing goal with 2:01 left on the clock.
The two scores put the Crimson up for good, and at the end of the day, Harvard (7-1, 2-0 Ivy) emerged with its sixth consecutive victory, prevailing 10-8. Dartmouth (2-5, 0-1), meanwhile, suffered its third straight defeat and is still seeking its first conference win since 2015.
“Every Ivy League game is tough, and credit to Dartmouth for playing a very good game, especially on the ground,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “The difference came down to end of game execution, where I thought we did a great job.”
Before Harvard pulled away at the end, it looked for long stretches in the first half as if the Big Green was on its way to snatching a road win in Cambridge. Freshman face-off specialist Kiernan Gunn was sharp for the visitors in the first half, winning 7-of-11 face-offs as Dartmouth outplayed the Crimson on the ground, picking up 15 ground balls to Harvard’s 12.
After the Big Green took the lead late in the second quarter, the Crimson made a substitution at the face-off X, bringing in junior James Sullivan to try to revitalize the ground game. Sullivan delivered, winning 8-of-11 of his face-offs the rest of the way to swing the momentum in Harvard’s direction.
“In the third quarter, we recommitted to scrapping for balls and getting back in control of the game,” Wojcik said. “Especially, James [Sullivan] did a really good job of providing a spark and setting the tone for us coming out of halftime.”
While the offense and ground game took time to find its footing on Saturday, the defense was solid throughout. After giving up a season high 18 goals to the Terriers on Tuesday, the Crimson limited Dartmouth to eight goals on just 29 shots.
Shaw made crucial saves throughout, including two back-to-back in the fourth quarter when the game was still tied, 8-8.  In front of him, senior Joe Kearney played a key role in defending the Big Green’s top options. Captain and midfielder Sean Coleman and defender Jonathan Butler also made important contributions with four and three ground ball pickups, respectively.
“Obviously it wasn’t our best performance on Tuesday,” Shaw said. “But this week, we focused on increasing our communication, supporting each other better, and I think we did a lot of that in shutting them down today.”
On the offensive side of the ball, Cheek once again led the way with five points, courtesy of one goal and four assists. Salvatore, who scored the game-winner, recorded his first career hat trick, while senior midfielder Carney Mahon tacked on two goals for Harvard.
“We didn’t start the game as well as we would have liked,” Coleman said. “But in the third and fourth quarters, we were able to make some timely plays, get some timely scores, and once the tide turned our way, we were able to close out the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the water for the first time this season, the Harvard-Radcliffe heavyweight crew dug its oars into the expanse of the Cooper River in Camden, N.J., facing chilly conditions while racing against two tough Big 10 opponents in Michigan State and Ohio State to open up the spring dual season.
In the end, the Black and White claimed four of the five races against the Green and White while conceding all five races to the Buckeyes.
After a strenuous winter training and an early spring regimen, Harvard-Radcliffe entered the race and 2,000-meter spring season fresh off a spring break training trip to Florida. The team traveled to its competition on Thursday—a day earlier than last year—according to sophomore coxswain Katherine Paglione.
“That was to give us a full day Friday to have two practices of the water, to be a little more settled coming into the Saturday races,” Paglione said. “I think the six hour bus ride is something that people have to work around in terms of their stiffness, people could stretch in their rooms or stretch in this designated room.”
The Black and White lined up against Michigan State in the morning and Ohio State in the afternoon, a two race sequence that Paglione said is important to acclimate the team to important races later in the season.
“The whole set-up of racing twice a day is also really good practice for us because as the season progresses and those final championship regattas, those are often two races in a day,” Paglione said. “We were really happy to have the opportunity to rehearse that and see how people feel with that. I think we were happy about how we did against those two teams.”
Harvard-Radcliffe opened the season with a convincing victory over the Green and White in the varsity eight, crossing the finish five seconds faster than its Michigan State counterpart in 6:43.1. The victory marks a reversal from last season, where the group lost. Junior Erica Holmes, the fifth seat of the eight, said that the team’s fast early start gave them a lead that they would ultimately maintain.
“I think that first 200 meters of racing for the whole season to be up three feet definitely gave us a huge confidence boost, and it enabled us to relax for the rest of the race and really find a good rhythm and keep our lead,” Holmes said. “It was actually much colder than people expected, so in the last 500 meters, most of us lost feelings in our hands, which was a case of hanging on right until the end literally.”
The second varsity eight followed up with an even larger margin of victory, beating Michigan State by thirteen seconds in 6:52.8. Paglione, the coxswain for the second eight, said that the boat’s energy originated from a strong performance from stroke seat freshman Caroline Noble.
“It wasn’t a technically perfect race, but we were at least moving together, and I think another thing that the boat did really well in that race was to continue to move,” Paglione said. “We were pretty much a length up the first 20 strokes, so we probably could have sat comfortably there and still won by a length, but the boat did a really good job of continuing even where there wasn’t that side-by-side competition pushing them.”
The Black and White took the varsity four and varsity four B races from the Spartans, but lost the third varsity eight. Harvard Radcliffe also lost all five races to the Buckeyes in the afternoon by at least 10 seconds.
Moving forward, Paglione said that the team derives its competitive drive from within itself, which will prepare it for an exciting season on the water this spring.
“I think the whole idea of your teammate being your toughest competitor is something that we strove for last year but are starting to really attain this year,” Paglione said. “If we know that the toughest person we’re going to come across is on our team everyday in practice, we feel pretty much prepared for any opponent on the water, That attitude has really carried us, and I think it’s going to continue to carry us. I think it’s just exciting to race.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team moved back to .500 on Sunday at home against Quinnipiac, improving its record to 8-8. This matchup against the Bobcats (8-6, 3-0 MAAC) was also the last one before Ivy League play begins next Saturday when the Crimson visits Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H. The win against Quinnipiac comes off a spring break trip to Southern California.
“This week we will continue to work on building upon all that we gained over the spring break,” junior Isabel Jasper said. “I’m sure coach will have us continue to work on executing our doubles and singles play as well as building upon our fitness, which improved tremendously over the break.”
With wintry conditions still prevailing in the Boston area, the match was held on the indoor courts at Harvard’s Murr Center. The Crimson dropped just one individual match on the day, eventually triumphing, 6-1. Overall, Quinnipiac boasts a winning percentage of .571 and is undefeated in its conference.
Harvard won its first point of the day by sweeping Quinnipiac in doubles. Junior Erica Oosterhout and sophomore Natasha Gonzalez beat Dominique Vasile and Proyfon Lohophaison in second doubles by a score of 6-3. Another significant win in doubles was from captain Annika Ringblom and freshman Anna Li. The duo won, 6-4, in first doubles.
“Annika Ringblom did a really good job today of coming out strong in singles,” coach Traci Green said. “She had a lot of energy. She had a lot of focus. And she was playing the way she needed to be playing from the very beginning and that helped the team get rolling in the very beginning of the match.”
On court two, sophomore Jenna Friedel took on the Bobcats’ Jennifer Lu in second singles. As Friedel and Lu battled back and forth in the second set, Friedel yelled words of encouragement to herself before the start of nearly every point. Her teammates, lined up in a row on a neighboring court, matched her intensity and cheered her on.
“Jenna’s a fighter, always has been,” Green said. “The team gets fired up when she gets pumped up. It definitely helps us. Sometimes she channels it the right way, and she’s been working on that. It’s been going the right way the last few weeks, and we’re going to build off that for sure.”
Ultimately, Friedel’s high-energy effort paid off, as she beat Lu in two sets, 6-2, 6-3, at the second singles position.
A few other players stood out in singles play, including Gonzalez. She won three straight games in the second set of fourth singles to defeat Layla Rodriguez. Oosterhout earned her 16th singles victory over Dominique Vasile in first singles, 6-1, 6-0. Ringblom won her third singles match as well and as coach Green said, she helped bring the energy needed to motivate other players.
On Saturday the Crimson will face Dartmouth in its first Ivy League match. Last year, Harvard defeated a Dartmouth team that was ranked 44th in the nation, 4-3. Last year Harvard ended its season with a 17-8 record and a 5-2 record in conference—only losing to Cornell and Penn.
“Our focus all season has been to improve each day and practice and in matches we are doing just that,” Green said. “So as long as we stay on track and keep the right attitude good things will happen.”
The players have similar aspirations of improvement as their coach.
“Our goals for the rest of season are to compete as hard as we can in each of our remaining matches,” Jasper said. “The ultimate goal is to win Ivies and get a berth to the NCAA, but we will take it one match at a time. We need to control the things we can control and be ready for any obstacles—injuries, wind, sun—whatever comes our way. The most important thing is being supportive of each other, whether we are on the court playing or on the sidelines cheering. We win as a team and lose as a team.”

Look, no matter who headlines, Yardfest will have us all drunkenly screaming and jamming along. But if the CEB wants to start planning for 2019, these are all guaranteed to at least spark some controversy (if not excitement).
