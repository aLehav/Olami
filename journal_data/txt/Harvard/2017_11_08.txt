After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, Harvard University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote, “The University’s goal was always to include all eligible voters on the list”. He insists, “533 names were unintentionally omitted from the list of eligible voters.” His claim that these names were unintentionally omitted is directly contradicted by the fact that in its appeal to the National Labor Relations Board, Harvard continues to fight the eligibility of 195 voters. I am one of those voters, and Harvard continues to fight against my vote.
Last fall, students at private universities won the right to unionize, and with that newly enshrined right, Harvard students decided to take a vote on whether or not we wanted to unionize. As a first-year graduate student in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, I decided to participate in the vote as I wanted a say in my employment conditions as a student-worker. When I went to the polls to cast my vote, I was surprised to find that my name was not on the list, but instead I could cast a challenged ballot that I was told may or may not be counted. I later found out some 533 of us had been left off the list of eligible voters, but I could not understand why. Wasn’t I a graduate student and employee at this university? Didn’t I have a right for my vote to be counted just the same as everyone else?
As it turns out, the Harvard administration didn’t think so, arguing that first-years in my department should not count as common law employees. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to argue my case before the Hearing Officer at the Regional NLRB. I tried my best to explain the experience of first year graduate students in my department. I described my work researching and designing my project as well as the troubleshooting that goes along with that, and my experience working with another student in my lab helping with their project and learning from them. It is the nature of our department that students come in with varying levels of project development, but we are all accepted into the program with the understanding that the work we do, whether it be project design, learning techniques, data collection, or data analysis is part of the research process.
To find out that the Harvard administration is still trying to argue that the votes of 195 graduate students, including myself, should not be counted is astonishing. They continue to fight to have our vote silenced and show disregard for the testimony that I and other student-workers gave. In their appeal to the NLRB, Harvard characterizes the work of first-year students in my department as “introductory, largely devoid of performance of research on behalf of the faculty member or the institution,” an assertion which is frankly false and disrespectful to the work we do. Any background research and training we do is work that we perform on behalf of faculty members and Harvard and is vital to our research. For example, a colleague of mine was able to present the work she did her first semester in Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology to the 2017 conference for the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology.
I believe that it is essential to the democratic process that all students left off the voter list, not just those from my department, be counted. The Regional Director of the NLRB agrees, and as such, ordered a new vote for student unionization at Harvard, requiring the Harvard administration to count our votes and provide the full list of voters to the union organizers so that the union has a fair chance to make its case to each eligible voter. Harvard’s argument, in part, for appealing this ruling, as stated in the recent email from the Provost, was that it was challenging to put the full list together. I am not unsympathetic to the difficulty of this task, but the students should not be the ones punished for what amounts to a bureaucratic failure. One student left of the voter list is too many. In a democracy, all voices must count equally and have equal opportunity to be heard.
I support unionization efforts because the same bureaucratic failures that left over 500 voters off the list also affect whether students are paid on time, paid the right amount, or have access to their employment benefits. As an employee at the University, I would like to have a say about how I am treated as an employee. I think the democratic nature of a union is the best way to make sure all student workers have a say in our employment conditions. However, the right to a new and fair election is not about my individual political beliefs. If we decide not to unionize in a fair election where the administration adheres to labor law, I am happy to abide by that decision. But first we must all have the right for our voices to be heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Thursday, the Republican-led Committee on Ways and Means released the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which will seek to deliver on various conservative talking points such as lowered corporate taxes. Whatever the merits of trickle-down economics, the legislation does not include exclusively cut taxes; it also includes a measure to tax university endowments. In particular, it would tax  the endowment income of private institutions with at least 500 students and assets of $100,000 or more per full-time student at a 1.4 percent rate. Though this tax may seem trivial, Harvard, for example, would have paid nearly $43 million this fiscal year to the federal government were it to have been in place.
The rationales for this tax are varied. The most immediate justification is to offset the aforementioned corporate tax cuts; the measure would bring in an approximate $3 billion from 2018 to 2027 from approximately 140 institutions of higher learning, helping to partially offset the approximate $1 trillion tax cut that corporations would enjoy under the new tax code. In essence, the bill would then serve as a form of income redistribution, from the coffers of the universities that place America at the forefront of higher education to the coffers of large corporations. We believe that the money can be used for greater good at institutions of higher learning, and therefore believe that their financial well-being should be prioritized over that of corporations, at least in this situation.
Another more peculiar rationale—held by Representative Tom Reed, a Republican whose district includes Cornell University—is that this measure would obligate universities to redirect their money toward important matters such as tuition assistance and encourage them to reduce rampant tuition expenses. Though we too believe in affordable higher education and that universities should not just hoard money, we struggle to see how tighter budgets would result in decreased expenses for students attending these universities. We anticipate quite the contrary: Universities would be tempted to shift the costs onto students, thereby decreasing accessibility and exacerbating student debt.
However, as adverse as this plan’s effects would be on Harvard, even greater concern is needed for those colleges and universities that are well-endowed enough to be taxed by this legislation but that lack the resources to weather it. Taxing these universities’ endowments at the expense of tax breaks for corporations will hamper research, teaching, and financial aid in ways that will ultimately provide less for the economy and society at large than more robust higher education. 
University President Drew G. Faust, to her credit, has been vocal in her opposition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Ultimately, whether or not it will pass lies in the hands of the federal government. Nevertheless, in the event that the plan is implemented, Faust—and her imminent successor—can directly set Harvard’s response to this lost revenue. In doing so, we call on them to ensure that this development will not adversely affect financial aid at the College. Harvard must uphold its commitment to socioeconomic diversity, regardless of national politics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zoe: When I was in the fourth grade, I thought I was in love with a boy in my class. He gave me butterflies and made my heart race all at once. I thought it was a “forever” kind of love, one for the screens of blockbuster movies and storybook scenes. After a few weeks, I decided it was serious enough to share with my family. I told my mom about how seeing him made me fill with an insurmountable happiness, in a way I’d never felt before and thought I’d never feel again.
Her first question was about what color painted his skin. Naively, I was confused about why she would ask about something so seemingly random. I answered that he was half white and half Chinese, and she replied he wasn’t the right type for me. He wasn’t Mexicano, didn’t speak any sort of Spanish, or eat tortillas religiously. He was the right gender, just not the right skin color.
Ruben: Dating a Latina is fine, though someone outside of my nationality might raise some tías’ eyebrows. If she is able to benefit from proximity to whiteness, even better. Whiteness is beautiful, whiteness is the standard, and whiteness is what we’re taught to strive for. To date a white girl is a sort of conquest—a sign that you’ve made it. The phrase “mejorar la raza”—better the race—is used as praise when we date those lighter than ourselves. Latinx families make it clear: Dating a white girl or a light-skinned Latina is fine. Dating a black or dark-skinned woman is questioned at best and prohibited at worst.
Z: I was told that dark skin would never be welcomed as a natural fit for my familia. Jokes and threats made me grow up thinking I just wasn’t meant to love blackness, that I was actively meant to believe it had no beauty. White skin that can tan: now that was different. Caramel skin—lightly tinted to so you knew it was ethnic—with brown hair and café-colored eyes might not make the most beautiful combination, but they would create the man who should wait at the end of the aisle for me. Even a crush was too close: I had a responsibility as a Mexicana to raise a family that continued my family’s cultural legacy—mestizaje lightened by European colonization.
R: Despite our families’ bias, to love, kiss, or crush on a white classmate is viewed as a transgression to the younger, more-aware sectors of our community. In the Latinx community on campus, we argue over whether or not dating white people is self-hatred—an adoration of the colonizer. I let it slip that, in the eighth grade, I told people that I was only into “white girls,” and I’ve yet to hear the end of it. For a generation hyper-aware of race, a generation still grappling with the murders of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, the way we love is scrutinized as a political statement. We don’t want to think about how our skin looks against our partner’s, but we do because we know that love is political, love is racial.
Z: It didn’t matter that my young mind hadn’t yet begun to internalize race and love as intertwined, but after that day, the seeds dripping in a racism passed down from generation to generation had been planted. I dreamed of Spanish words and blue eyes, but in my mind one was meant for me and the other was meant to be idolized. It didn’t matter who they were, but it mattered where they came from: Mexicanos, Mexicanos, Mexicanos, but del norte, not del sur, because, of course, they couldn’t be too indigenous-looking.
Also, didn’t I know? Salvadorans couldn’t commit. Dominicans were too dark. South Americans just didn’t exist. These were the lessons I was taught, born from the mouths of my predominantly Mexican community, and reinforced every year I was growing up.
R+Z: Though it may be unfair to have to justify our feelings, thinking of love as a site for racial and ethnic justice can be productive. A relationship may force your family to address the anti-blackness that goes unspoken. Contemplating what it means to ask your white girlfriend to take your Latino-sounding last name can be a step in the struggle for racial equity. When we date while brown, we are not freed of our country’s histories of racism—but we can be empowered to confront them.
Only then can we begin to lessen our obsession with whiteness and realize beauty can be found in brownness, blackness, and every skin color in existence. Prejudice can be found intertwined with love, for ourselves and who we may one day share our lives with, but it can, and should, be challenged, unlearned, and confronted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 7, 2017 at 6:46 p.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted down a motion designed to nullify the College’s penalties on single-gender social groups Tuesday, a major victory for administrators who have defended the policy against faculty criticism for almost two years.
At their monthly Faculty meeting on Tuesday professors voted by paper ballot on a motion introduced by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 stating that the College shall not “discipline, penalize, or otherwise sanction students” for joining “any lawful organization.”
130 professors voted against the motion, while 90 supported it.
“I’m disappointed, but life will go on,” Lewis said after the meeting.
The future of Harvard’s social policy now rests in the hands of University President Drew G. Faust, who will select one of three options proposed by a committee tasked with reevaluating a May 2016 policy on  final clubs and Greek organizations. Faust–who has said she will make a decision before she steps down in June–could maintain the current penalties for members of single-gender social organizations, ban membership in unrecognized groups outright, or consider “some other possible solutions."
Before Faculty voted on the motion, several professors and administrators took the floor to argue their positions on the motion.
In a rare move, Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 stepped up to the microphone, arguing that the clubs create a toxic and exclusive environment on campus. Dingman added that while he was a member of a final club as an undergraduate, their role on campus has since changed.
Lewis also gave the Faculty his final pitch to support his motion. “The report stated that the President would choose among the options, even though matters of discipline of students are for this body to decide, not the President or any dean,” Lewis said. “The President has declined to acknowledge that this matter is within Faculty jurisdiction.”
Economics professor Benjamin M. Friedman said that he is worried about the implications of Harvard’s social policy for the future of the University.
“I am worried because while we have heard a great deal about Harvard values, I do not recognize the values and the distinctions we seem so intent on imposing. I do not understand how membership in the American Nazi party is consistent with Harvard values, but membership in the A.D. is not,” he added, referring to one of the all-male final clubs.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, one of the primary architects of the social group policy, was the last to offer his opinion before the vote. He argued that the final clubs, despite their lack of formal association with the University, were inseparably tied to Harvard and had a significant impact on the student body.
After Khurana spoke, Computer Science professor Boaz Barak abruptly ended discussion by calling for an immediate vote: “I think after two years of discussion, it’s best to just call for a vote,” Barak said.
With overwhelming audible approval, the Faculty approved Barak’s move to end discussion and subsequently voted by paper ballot on the Lewis motion. Faust struggled to call the meeting back to order as the Faculty cast their votes.
While Faculty waited to hear the results of the vote, East Asian Languages and Civilizations professor David L. Howell introduced his own social group-inspired motion for discussion only. The motion—which will be eligible for a vote at the December Faculty meeting—moves that the Faculty recognize that basic rights and freedoms may come into conflict with each other at Harvard, and in these cases “it is the responsibility of the faculty and administration of Harvard College to establish policies that protect individual freedoms and rights while upholding the educational mission of the College.”
Howell said he had expected to present his motion after the results of the Lewis motion came in. He said he had written a version of his speech for either scenario, prompting laughter from the assembled Faculty.
“The Faculty should most certainly affirm our commitment to important principles. But we need to do so in a way that recognizes that principles do not exist in a vacuum,” he said. “Just as we do in our legal system, here at Harvard we must constantly strive to balance the rights of the individual with the needs of the community.”
Although the Howell motion was not discussed at length, several professors including Friedman and Richard F. Thomas briefly expressed opposition to it.
The Faculty Council voted to pass Howell’s motion 16 to one. The vote is purely advisory.
The Faculty also heard two proposals: one to change the time of monthly Faculty meetings to align with the new fall 2018 academic schedule, and one to formalize the College’s policy on cross-registration with Harvard’s professional schools. Government professor Danielle S. Allen also presented the preliminary recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging.
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris joked to the packed room that he was so glad to see so many professors in attendance to discuss cross-registration policy.

In almost every way, John F. Manning ’82 is the very image of a Harvard Law School dean. With two Harvard degrees, a Supreme Court clerkship, years of administrative experience at the school, and well-regarded scholarship to his name, Manning checks all of the expected boxes for the leader of one of the country’s preeminent legal institutions.
Except one. Manning is a conservative.
Beginning this summer, Manning took the helm of a school once labeled the “Beirut on the Charles” for the heated ideological warfare among professors. Today, while professors’ intellectual disputes no longer garner analogies to violent conflict, student and faculty debates frequently result in campus protest and opinion pieces in national media outlets.
It will fall to Manning, a textualist who clerked for former Associate Supreme Court Justice Antonin G. Scalia, to lead a school not known for its modesty.
Jeffrey R. Toobin ’82, a former Crimson editor and legal expert for The New Yorker, said that he thinks Manning’s conservatism will be beneficial for the school.
“For the preeminent law school in the country, I think it’s useful not to have a single political identity and John’s appointment reflects that,” Toobin said.
But even as his academic scholarship distinguishes him from many of his avowed liberal predecessors, Manning will draw from years of experience as the deputy dean under former Law School Dean Martha L. Minow. Well-liked by many of his colleagues on the faculty, Manning said his priorities include fostering debate at the Law School, reviewing the school’s curriculum, and deepening the school’s sense of community.
“Being dean of Harvard Law School is a really hard job — there are a lot of demands on your time, a lot of constituencies that need to be satisfied — it’s like being president of a small college,” Law School professor Richard J. Lazarus said.  “I think that people are very enthusiastic.”
Manning, who graduated from the Law School in 1985, spent his early legal career clerking for Robert H. Bork on the US Court of Appeal for the DC Circuit, and for Justice Scalia during the 1988 October Term.
After serving in the Department of Justice and working briefly in private practice, Manning held a professorship at Columbia until 2007 when then-dean Elena Kagan invited him to teach at Harvard. The appointment was part of Kagan’s effort to hire conservative faculty members at the school.  In 2013, Manning became Deputy Dean of the Law School, a post he held until he assumed his deanship in July.
At the center of Manning’s conservatism is  textualism, a theory of constitutional interpretation focusing on the text of the document, rather than on external factors like historical intent. Manning has published a series of articles over the course of his career supporting this interpretive theory. He is also an expert in public law and the separation of powers.
Unlike his predecessor Minow, who frequently said her academic scholarship informed her approach to the deanship, Manning said his textualist legal scholarship will not affect how he leads the Law School.
“My job is to foster a large community in which there are lots of different perspectives, approaches, and methodologies,” Manning said. “What I do for my scholarship has nothing to do with what kind of things I’ll support as dean.”
Though Manning’s ideologies fall outside the liberal slant of the Law School’s faculty, he has been well received as he’s assumed his new role, Lazarus said.
“The fact that he was so universally embraced by the faculty and by Martha Minow, and by President Faust, even though he does have that kind of bent, shows you how good they think he is,” he said.
Lazarus said Manning is open to ideas from across the ideological spectrum and prizes intellectual debate and disagreement.
“While he has some views on things, he is unbelievably celebratory of people with different views,” Lazarus said. “There’s nothing at all limiting or exclusive about him — he is a real academic. He loves academic debate, he loves academic discussion, he doesn’t just promote all his ideas.”
Because Manning served as Deputy Dean before his July appointment, he is no stranger to the Law School’s corner office. In that role, Manning said, he worked closely with Minow, his predecessor, and learned a great deal about the Law School and University at large.
“You get to know well the senior staff and you get to know the curriculum and you get to know all aspects of the school,” Manning said. “I worked on curriculum, I worked on appointments, I worked on pedagogical reform.”
Manning was also part of the working group that considered accepting the GRE as an admissions test in place of the LSAT, a policy that the Law School adopted in the spring. He also serves as a member of the University-wide Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging.
Familiarity with the trappings of the deanship has allowed Manning to jump right into the job. He has begun hosting “Meals With Manning” lunches with students and staff on a weekly basis to build relationships and solicit ideas and feedback from a wide range of Law School constituencies.
Law School professor Bruce H. Mann, who chaired the school’s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion, said Manning began his tenure by “casting a wide net.” He met individually with all 114 members of the Law School’s faculty, and other staff and administrators, over the summer.
David A. Azcarraga, the president of La Alianza, the Law School’s affinity group for Latino students, said that Manning has also made it a point to attend more student group meetings. Manning also met with leadership from Lambda, the Law School’s BLGTQ student group, in September when members of the group staged a protest of military recruiting on campus, which they argued is discriminatory against transgender students.
Adrian D. Perkins, the Law School’s student government president, said that he has a good relationship with Manning going into the year because he knew him from his first-year classes. He said he thinks he’s done a “fantastic” job so far, and hopes that his current commitment to hearing student voices will continue.
“He’s hit the ground running, he’s been very attentive to student voices,” Perkins said. “Thus far he’s promoted an environment of inclusiveness, so I hope that that continues, and also emboldening students to be leaders in the environment and have voices.”
In front of a crowd more than 100 people in early September, Manning called for Harvard Law School to move on from its “evil” past in pursuit of a “wiser...fairer...and more decent future.” He was one of several speakers at the event unveiling a new memorial for the slaves of the family that endowed the school more than 200 years prior.
As the Law School enters its third century, it continues to confront its own history—whether that be its legacy of slave ownership, teaching methods in the classroom, or approach to admissions.
In March 2016, the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, voted to remove the Law School’s seal, the crest of a formerly slaveholding family that had become the subject of debate and protest at the school. While Manning said the school has yet to decide on an exact protocol on the symbolic change, he’s working with a variety of Law School constituencies to understand the path to a more inclusive community.
During the search for Minow’s successor, several affinity groups at the Law School endorsed David B. Wilkins ’77 for the deanship, arguing that he was the best-prepared to modernize the school’s curriculum.
Paavani Garg, the president of the Women’s Law Association, said that she and her organization are looking forward to working with Manning, and are not particularly concerned by the fact that the was chosen for the deanship rather than Wilkins.
“It wasn’t that we didn’t think that anyone else wasn’t the right candidate,” Garg said. “It wasn’t an exclusive type thing, and while it’s sad to see Professor Wilkins not get the role, we’re still looking forward to working with Dean Manning.”
Manning also said he plans to address the findings of the school’s Task Force on Diversity and Inclusion, which were released in June. Over the summer, the Law School started working to improve mentoring and advising programs for first-year students.
“The value added by mentoring and advising is not evenly distributed across the population and the propensity to seek mentoring and advising is not evenly distributed across the population,” Manning said.
“Sometimes the people who would benefit most from a great mentor or advisor are not as likely to seek them out and so what we did over the summer is we tried to make it to create multiple opportunities for students to develop an organic, effective advising and mentoring relationship,” he added.
On top of the initiatives he will champion, he will also deal with the day-to-day obligations of fundraising for the school. In its “Campaign for the Third Century,” the Law School has raised $365 million, surpassing its $305 million goal. And while Manning is preparing to continuing soliciting donations through the campaign’s end in June, he’s also looking to the next 100 years of Harvard Law School.
“Our alumni are leaders in area after area, field after field, year after year, and now we can say century after century,” Manning said at event earlier this year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Acting Attorney General Sally Q. Yates criticized President Donald Trump’s behavior toward the United States Department of Justice and said she thinks Trump has violated essential presidential norms at an Institute of Politics event Tuesday night.
Yates particularly criticized Trump’s treatment of Robert Mueller’s ongoing special counsel investigation into any possible coordination between Trump’s presidential campaign and the Russian government. Yates said that even if Trump has not actually broken the law, she believes he has violated essential political norms and presidential expectations.
“Everybody sort of thinks that we’re going to look to Bob Mueller to tell us whether bad things happened—we already know bad things happened,” she said. “Our standard for our president shouldn’t be, ‘Anything short of a felony is okay.’”
Yates, who served as Deputy Attorney General under former President Barack Obama, spoke for roughly an hour, analyzing the current state of the Department of Justice and reflecting on her own career. Yates made national headlines in January when she refused to uphold Trump’s executive order barring travel from seven majority countries.
“It still is a little weird to me to have served for nearly 30 years in the department, and to be known for an act that was in the last 10 days,” she said.
During the event, Yates said what she called the present administration’s repeated tendency to “goad the Justice Department into going after people” is extremely dangerous to American political and civic norms. She was also critical of the President’s comments about the New York City terrorist attacker, who killed eight people with a truck last week in lower Manhattan. Trump tweeted on Nov. 1 that he thinks the attacker deserves the death penalty.
“That’s one of the norms violated here that I think is really damaging to public confidence,” she said. “Part of the way I think the Justice Department should respond is by not responding to that. I think the folks at DOJ should, and I expect will, do exactly what they think is the right thing to do there regardless of a not-so-subtle message that they’re getting from the president.”
“Still it can have an impact on those cases; it will complicate things for the Justice Department,” Yates said.
Yates ended the evening with a plea for engagement: She said she hopes students and young people interested in civil service will not be discouraged from careers in public service by current political turbulence.
“Maybe the biggest tragedy out of all of this would be if people are discouraged from public service,” she said. “Please don’t be discouraged from going into public service—one person, whether that person is president or not, does not define our country.”

The 30 freshmen living in Apley Court do not have to worry about the honking and clanging emanating from the Smith Campus Center construction site anymore.
Dean of Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen, along with the Harvard University Construction Mitigation Team and Apley Court’s proctors, purchased noise cancelling headphones and white noise machines for residents after concerns that sounds from the construction site were disrupting daily life.
“Construction starts at 7 a.m., so that means that setting up starts before then, so really the goal of getting the noise cancelling headphones and the white noise machines is to make sure it limits the students from being woken up,” Ranen said.
Construction on the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center in the Square began in 2016 and will continue through fall 2018. The renovations have posed challenges for students who say noise from the construction site has disrupted their daily life, and local businesses who say it eliminates parking space in the area.
Alexander S. Koenig ’21 said the noise has become less bothersome as the semester has progressed.
“It was worse before they finished putting in the glass panels, which happened during part of September,” Koenig said. “Before that, it was much noisier. It would start at 7 a.m. every day, which was a little annoying.”
Some students who have continued to be bothered by the construction have devised their own methods of cancelling out the noise.
“It was kind of hard to sleep at first because of it, but I’ve started just playing music in my room to fall asleep because that is louder usually,” Wilfried J. Zibell ’21 said.
Koenig also said Ranen has been extremely accommodating, offering his suite an air conditioning unit at the start of the semester so they could keep their windows shut when it was hot outside.
“So, our resident dean was kind enough to get us an air conditioner because we were on the first floor, so most of the time when it was noisy, we just had all the windows closed,” Koenig said.
For Ranen, the purchases have gone well amongst students in the building.
“I mean it’s the small things that we can do, you know, again, it’s not ideal, but I think that when it opens next year, it’s going to be really cool,” Ranen said.

Boston residents have re-elected Martin J. Walsh for a second term as mayor on Tuesday.
Walsh defeated his opponent, Tito Jackson, as predicted by polls. At press time, Walsh was leading Jackson 66 percent to 34 percent. Jackson, a member of Boston City Council, ran against the well-established incumbent, touting policies aimed at addressing racial inequality and affordable housing. Had he been elected, Jackson would have become Boston’s first black mayor.
During his first term, the Walsh administration attracted General Electric’s headquarters to Boston and announced a goal of building 53,000 residential units by 2030. In this election, Walsh promised to focus on improving public education in Boston.
President Drew G. Faust has met with Walsh on a “semi-annual basis” over his four-year tenure, according to Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Public Affairs and Communications. The two are sometimes seen together at joint events like the groundbreaking of William F. Smith Field renovations in Allston. The University owns more land in Boston than in Cambridge.
In an email sent in May, Walsh emphasized the importance of representing residents’ best interests in Harvard’s ongoing expansion.
Construction of Harvard’s $1 billion science and engineering complex in Allston is on schedule, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is scheduled to move across the Charles in 2020.
“My job as Mayor of Boston is to advance the interests of all of Boston’s residents, and it’s vital their voices are heard when it comes to residential development in Allston,” Walsh wrote in May.
Though Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke did not comment on the mayoral race directly, she said the University values its partnership with its host cities.
“There are few cities in the world that are home to such an exceptional mix of innovation, research, educational, and cultural institutions and Harvard looks forward to working collaboratively with Cambridge and Boston municipal leaders in the years ahead,” she wrote in an email.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana can breathe a sigh of relief.
After more than a year of uncertainty about the future of the College's penalties on single-gender social organizations, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted down a motion meant to cancel the social life penalties.
The policy’s future was in jeopardy almost from the start. Weeks after the sanctions’ May 2016 debut, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 introduced Faculty legislation intended to kill them. Lewis’s motion has dogged College administrators ever since.
Lewis spent 18 months pillorying the penalties and seeking support for his motion, holding forth at faculty meetings, in public debates, and on his personal blog. He framed the debate as an historic struggle for the University’s soul. Before the vote Tuesday, one of his supporters compared the sanctions to McCarthyism, the Vietnam War, and the invasion of Afghanistan.
But after an hour of impassioned speeches, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to quash Lewis’s motion by a margin of 130 to 90.
For now at least, what some consider Khurana’s signature initiative as dean is safe.
University President Drew G. Faust first announced the College’s social life penalties—which, starting with the Class of 2021, bar members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain fellowships—in May 2016. Since then, Khurana—who helped formulate the sanctions—has largely become the face of the effort on campus.
Speaking shortly after the vote Tuesday evening, Khurana did not directly answer a question asking how he felt about the result. He said he plans to partner with undergraduates to make the College a more inclusive place.
“I’m really grateful to my colleagues for all of us enriching and engaging on a deep and complex subject,” Khurana said. “I look forward to working with our students to creating the kind of inclusive environment that they all aspire to.”
David L. Howell, a professor of Japanese history, wrote in an emailed statement he is glad the faculty struck down the motion.
“I’m relieved that the Lewis motion failed,” Howell said. “I understand and appreciate many of the concerns its supporters had about the USGSO policy, but a blanket statement like the Lewis motion wasn’t the best mechanism to resolve the issues.”
But for those on the opposite side, Tuesday evening spelled defeat and disappointment.
“This doesn’t make sense,” long-time sanctions opponent and English professor Helen Vendler said after the vote. Vendler, an outspoken critic of the sanctions, previously called the administration’s tactics “loathsome.”
Math professor Wilfried Schmid said he thinks the decision to vote down the motion was a “huge mistake.”
“I must say I’m as much disappointed in my colleagues as I am in the motion failing,” Schmid said.
Though Lewis’s motion failed, Harvard’s final club policy could still change. Before the end of her tenure in June, Faust will choose either to keep the current policy, ban all single-gender social groups, or select from a set of alternatives. Eric M. Nelson, a Government professor, wrote in an email that he hopes Faculty support for the Lewis motion will influence the administration’s decision.
“I’m immensely grateful to the 90 faculty colleagues who supported the motion, and to Professor Lewis for his remarkable courage and perseverance,” he wrote. “I hope that the administration will take seriously the fact that such a large proportion of the Faculty is now on record as opposing their general approach to this issue.”
Khurana’s supporters had a different suggestion for the dean. As Khurana left the room Tuesday evening, friends and colleagues clapped him on the back, offering congratulations and recommending the Dean fix himself a drink.
“Have a gin,” said one.
“Have a whiskey,” shouted another.

A preliminary vote count shows Cambridge electing six incumbents and three new officials to City Council, though the final result could still change as the Cambridge Election Commission counts write-in and auxiliary ballots.
In the initial tally, every incumbent who ran—E. Denise Simmons, Marc C. McGovern, Jan Devereux, Timothy J. Toomey, Dennis J. Carlone, and Craig A. Kelley—was re-elected in a field of 26 candidates. Three new councillors, Sumbul Siddiqui, Quinton Zondervan, and Alanna Marie Mallon, are poised to fill spots left by Councillors who will step down at the end of their terms.
But Kelley’s margin of victory was so small that votes from write-in and auxiliary ballots could still elect close runner-up Sean Tierney in his stead. Absentee ballots and provisional ballots will be counted on Nov. 17.
Technical snafus hindered the vote count process on Tuesday night and early Wednesday morning. The computerized tabulation process the Cambridge Election Commission has used since 1997 broke down, delaying preliminary results by hours as election officials counted paper ballots.
Still, the candidates with wide enough margins of victory to consider themselves Cambridge City Councillors did not seem to mind.
“It took awhile, and it took some extra suspense, but I’m excited and honored and grateful,” Zondervan said.
An unusually large number of voters turned out in this year’s election. According to early data from the Election Commission, 21,412 valid ballots were turned in this year, a 20 percent increase over the 17,854 votes cast in the 2011 municipal election.
Nadeem A. Mazen, an outgoing City Councillor who recently launched a bid for a seat in Congress, praised the candidates and the overall tenor of the campaign.
“Over the past few days though, especially in the last 72 hours, a lot of the negativity around the campaign has dissipated,” he said.
Voters in Cambridge also elected five incumbents—Patricia M. Nolan ’80, Manikka L. Bowman, Emily R. Dexter, Alfred B. Fantini, and Kathleen M. Kelly—and one new candidate, Lawrence Kimbrough, to the city’s school committee.
Among those who came up short on election night were two Harvard undergraduates. Nadya T. Okamoto ’20, who launched her campaign for City Council as a freshman, lost her election, as did William H. MacArthur ’20, who ran for School Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an illustrious career in Cambridge, former Harvard point guard Siyani Chambers ’16 was an integral member of the team for four years. Now across the pond in Austria, Chambers is proving to be equally essential to his new team.
The former Crimson standout, now a member of BC Raiffeisen Flyers Wels in the Austria-A Bundesliga, has settled into a crucial role as the new point guard. The team leader in multiple categories, Chambers is averaging 15.7 points, 4.2 assists, and 1.5 steals, all tops on the team. He also leads his side with eight three-pointers made.
While in college, Chambers established himself as a top performer in his rookie year. In the 2012-2013 season, Chambers won Ivy League Rookie of the Year and was named All-Ivy League. This campaign was far from his ceiling, as Chambers continued to dazzle on the court, landing on the all-conference team in each of his four years.
Chambers finished his career 12th all time with 1,287 career points, sixth all time with 163 career steals, and second all time with 605 career assists.
His distinguished career was not devoid of challenges, however. In the summer of 2015, before what was to be his final season, Chambers suffered a torn ACL. In order to rehab his knee and return for his senior season, Chambers took a voluntary leave of absence for the school year.
Returning for the 2016-2017 season as team captain, Chambers posted a fantastic season, leading the Ancient Eight in assists per game and propelling the Crimson into the first-ever Ivy League Tournament.
Now taking Austria by storm, the former Leverett resident from Golden Valley, Minnesota, is a star for his new squad. If his history at Harvard is any indication, Chambers’ rookie season is just the beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first meet of the season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team nearly swept Columbia, winning nine of 11 events en route to a resounding 150.5-87.5 road victory at Uris Pool on Sunday.
“I think the meet went very well,” junior Brittany Usinger said. “We actually had an inter-squad meet last weekend. We wanted our team to get the kinks out in the beginning of the season, so that helped prepare us going into Columbia. I think our plan going in was to really focus on… executing our race plans well.”
Usinger posted a strong performance herself, swimming butterfly in the Crimson’s 200 medley relay. She finished with a first-place time 1:42.52, topping the Lions’ 1:44.24. The relay also featured sophomores Mei Lynn Colby and Jerrica Li along with freshman Ingrid Wall. Colby went on to later win the 50 free by 0.17 seconds with a time of 23.67.
Usinger also shined in the 200 fly, out-touching Columbia’s Jessica He by 0.11 seconds to finish with a time of 2:04.00, good for another top place.
“We’ve been working on really committing to our finishes and keeping our heads down and really racing the people next to us,” Usinger said. “In practice, of course we’re doing that with our teammates, but we’ve been preparing to do that against people of other teams as well, so I think everyone is doing a great job committing to finishing our races strong.”
Harvard dominated the 1000 freestyle, finishing with the top four places, led by sophomore Matti Harrison, who recorded a time of 10:19.35. Harrison maintained low 31s in her 50 splits and finished her roaring race with a speedy 100 in a minute flat. Senior Regan Kology, freshman Annabelle Paterson, and junior Sonia Wang followed Harrison.
In the 200 backstroke, senior captain Kristina Li finished with a quick time of 2:00.69. Li credited the team’s impressive races to strong preparation in the offseason and beginning of the season.
“We have different training groups depending on what we swim, so we’ve got distance group and sprint group and stroke groups and divers have been working on their dives as well,” Li said. “So things like keeping our stroke long and working on our walls, just a lot of technique stuff we’ve been working on for a couple of months now … that was a big focus of the week this weekend.”
New members to the Crimson also left a favorable impression for a bright future. Freshman Kennidy Quist tore through the water, finishing with a time of 5:01.30 in the 500 freestyle. Junior Meagan Popp finished a close second.
“[The freshmen] have done an excellent job settling in, and they’ve done a great job staying positive and not letting nerves overtake them for that first meet,” Usinger said.
Columbia’s A team took first place in the 200 freestyle relay with a time of 1:35.31. The other Lions’ win came in the 200 breastroke.
In diving, the Crimson commanded the top three places in both the one-meter and three-meter events. In the three-meter, Senior Jing Leung and juniors Katie Russ and Mikaela Thompson finished with 299.47, 286.81, and 282.90 points, respectively. Thompson emerged victorious in the one-meter competition with 303.00 points.
“It’s kind of funny because a lot of swimmers, especially sprinters kind of execute their race plan and also give it their all and leave it all in the water,” Thompson said. “But for diving, it’s just trying to stay calm and managing your nerves so that you end up doing the dives you practiced.”
After a dominant victory, Harvard, the reigning Ivy League Champions, look to this meet as a launching pad for another successful year in the pool.
“We definitely have momentum going,” Li said. “This was a great meet obviously in terms of racing, but I think one of the big things we need to focus on is just keeping things in perspective and making sure we channel this momentum into our next meet as well, and focusing on the final goal of Ivies.”In its first meet of the season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team nearly swept Columbia, winning nine of 11 events en route to a resounding 150.5-87.5 road victory at Uris Pool on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the fall season coming to a close, freshman Neha Gupta had a chance to finish her rookie campaign undefeated at the Harvard Invitational this weekend. Playing in front of her home crowd in Cambridge, Mass., the freshman did just that.
The tournament took on a round-robin format, with six teams competing. Visiting schools included Boston University, Middle Tennessee, Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Wisconsin. The Crimson competed in both doubles and singles matches against the the Badgers on Friday, the Orange and the Terriers on Saturday, and the Panthers on Sunday, with the matches taking place in the Murr Center.
“Its pretty exciting to see how much we improved over the past few months,” said captain Annika Ringblom. “We got a big showing from every single member of the team. I’m really proud of the freshmen coming in, it’s always really tough in the first year to get a hold of tennis and school and everything, and they did an amazing job winning a very tough three matches.”
Younger members of the squad were some of the main contributors for Harvard over the course of the tournament, with Gupta and sophomore Irene Lu showing that they can compete, and win, against older opponents throughout the weekend.
Claiming three victories over her competitors from Pittsburgh, Wisconsin, and Boston University, Gupta completed the tournament unblemished. Accomplishing such a feat has been the norm for the Elk Grove, Calif. native in her rookie season for the Crimson, as she finished a perfect 11-0. According Ringblom, this achievement is an extremely rare occurrence for a freshman.
“Neha Gupta went undefeated for the whole fall season, which is pretty much unheard of,” Ringblom said. “As a freshman, that’s absolutely amazing.”
Harvard finished the third and final day of tournament play with mixed results. In singles, it won 4 of its 5 matches, with freshman Anna Li and Gupta continuing to show what they can do, winning by scores of 7-5, 6-3, and 7-5, 6-4, respectively.
In doubles play, the Crimson was not as dominant as the first two days, dropping two of its three matches against the Panthers. Sophomore Natasha Gonzalez and Li won their match by a score of 6-4, thereby closing out a successful weekend for Harvard
On Saturday, the Crimson continued to impress, winning all four of its singles matches against Syracuse, while winning one and losing one against the Terriers. Gonzalez battled to a 6-2, 4-6, 10-6 victory against senior Nicole Mitchell of Syracuse, while junior Erica Oosterhout defeated fellow junior Maria Tritou by a convincing margin of 6-3, 6-0.
In its doubles matches on Saturday, Harvard was less menacing, but it still finished 2-2 on the day. Freshmen duo Lia Kiam and Gupta fell 7-6 (5) to the Terriers duo of sophomore Clara Falxa and junior Sophia Kryloff, while Li and junior Isabel Jasper triumphed over Sabrina Faybyshev and Katya Martens of Boston University by a score of 6-2.
The Crimson got the weekend off to a strong start on Friday against University of Wisconsin with winning singles performances from Li, Gupta, and Lu. Li defeated senior Kelsey Grambeau by a score of 6-7(2), 6-4, 6-1, while Gupta won a close match against sophomore Michelle Linden which finished 7-5, 6-4, and Irene Lu cruised to victory against freshman Maryann Rompf, finishing 6-1, 6-2.
On the doubles side, Harvard continued to excel on Friday, winning four of its six matches on the day. Sophomore Lexi Milunovich paired up with junior Erica Oosterhout to win their bout by a score of 6-1, while sophomore Jenna Friedel and Gupta combined for a convincing 6-2 win over their Badgers opponents. Li and and Gonzalez battled to a tough 6-4 loss in their match.
“We feel really good about the weekend, it was a good opportunity for us to play some good teams here at home,” Friedel said. “We’re really grateful that we had so many fans come out to support us. We love playing at home because we’re comfortable here, and we can get our friends to come across the river to come watch us.”
The Harvard invitational was one of just three chances the Crimson tennis fans had to come out and watch their team during this fall season. Home matches will return on January 26th when Harvard host St. John’s University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 27, I assured Crimson fans that they did not have to worry about the quarterback situation in Cambridge.
After a nearly perfect outing against Brown (11-for-13 passing for 150 yards), I felt as though senior Joe Viviano had won back the trust of coach Tim Murphy. Though Murphy tabbed freshman Jake Smith to start against the Bears due to a lackluster season opener for the offense, it seemed natural that the veteran would command the bulk of the playing time going forward.
That’s not to say that Smith performed poorly—it’s just exceedingly rare that a freshman starts in situations like this. After all, Smith was the first rookie to start under center since Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05. Fitzpatrick has been in the NFL for the past 13 seasons.
Evidently, however, yet another one of my predictions lays in ruin, battered and bruised by the unpredictability of Ivy League football. Since that column, Viviano has thrown only 24 passes across three backup outings. Murphy handed the keys to the offense to Smith, and the rookie has taken advantage of the opportunity.
In his young career, Smith has thrown for 990 yards in seven games, recording a 57.1 completion percentage and five touchdowns in the process. The Ithaca, Mich., native won the Ivy League Rookie of the Week award for his three-touchdown performance in Harvard’s 25-22 victory over Dartmouth.
Just as Smith appeared to solidify his starting spot, he crumbled at Columbia. The freshman tossed four interceptions in the first half, leading Murphy to call in Viviano. The senior reinforced the Crimson’s comeback effort—most impressive were his touchdown run and his 65-yard pass to Henry Taylor that resulted in a score.
At the end of a multitude of twists and turns, this situation has returned to square one. From a quarterback standpoint, this week seems very much like the week after the Rhode Island game, when Murphy opted to insert Smith. This time, however, it is Viviano who may claim the starting spot from Smith.
Heading into a must-win game against Penn, it will be interesting to see how Murphy utilizes his primary passers and how quickly he will pull his starter if he struggles.
Despite the attention that the quarterback competition has garnered, it is defensive efforts that have propelled Harvard back into title contention.
Typically stout, the Crimson has posted underwhelming defensive statistics. The lackluster numbers are primarily due to one major blip on the radar—hosting Princeton, Harvard conceded a whopping 52 points, the third-most in program history.
But when one takes into account the dearth of healthy defensive players in the locker room, the Crimson’s performance has been impressive. The Princeton game remains the only blemish—in Harvard’s other seven contests, it has allowed an average of 17.5 points per game.
Especially notable were successes against Dartmouth and Columbia. In games against potent competition, in games the Crimson could not afford to lose under any circumstances, the defense went to work.
Hosting the Big Green, Harvard came up with a number of clutch plays. Most notably senior safety Tanner Lee ended Dartmouth’s last-ditch drive with an interception. Before the half, the Crimson also recovered a fumble on a punt. That turnover allowed the team to eliminate the first-half shutout and gain some momentum for the remaining two quarters.
Just last week, defensive tackle Richie Ryan exploded for 2.5 sacks en route to winning Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week. In total, Harvard sacked Lions signal caller Anders Hill eight times. This intense quarterback pressure halted Columbia—which benefited from an inordinate number of possessions in the first half—and prevented the hosts from running up the score.
The Lions failed to convert on these prime scoring chances on flipped fields, and this extended to a prolonged drought, allowing the Crimson to claw back into the game.
For a stretch of 43:08 between the first and fourth quarters, the Crimson blanked Columbia.
Juniors Cole Thompson and Charlie Walker also picked off Hill. These turnovers invigorated a Harvard offense that appeared shaky at times. Each interception gave Viviano a short field at the Lions’ 27, and Viviano pushed Harvard into the end zone on each drive.
If the Crimson’s defense continues to play with such poise and an evident sense of urgency, Harvard has a prime opportunity to enter the Yale Bowl with a shot at the league title. Let’s not completely neglect the offense, though. To be successful, the Crimson also needs junior running back Charlie Walker to complement the passing attack, and the passers need to limit turnovers as much as possible.
I’ll conclude with a revised prediction: If the Crimson is to compete in meaningful games over the next two weeks, look for Viviano and Smith to share the limelight, both between themselves and with the rest of the squad.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you want to hang with the best teams, you have to be able to play in their rinks.
The Harvard men’s hockey team certainly considers itself among the NCAA’s elite—so does the USCHO poll, in which the Crimson ranks fifth this week. And now, Harvard (2-1-0, 2-1-0 ECAC) will have a chance to justify this ranking as it takes to the road for a program-record nine straight contests.
The new-look 2017-2018 squad will visit Colgate (4-2-4, 1-0-1) and No. 14/12 Cornell (4-0-0, 2-0-0) in a pair of conference matchups.
“The Harvard-Cornell rivalry is a little bit more of a rivalry than a lot of guys know here,” junior forward Ryan Donato said. “Obviously we see the Harvard-Yale rivalry here, and get really excited for that, but our Harvard-Yale rivalry is [Cornell’s] Harvard-Cornell rivalry.
Each game provides its unique challenges. In its first away test of the season, the Crimson will confront a red-hot Raiders goaltender in sophomore Colton Point. The following evening, Harvard will play in arguably the rowdiest barn on its schedule, the animated Lynah Rink in Ithaca, N.Y.
Starting the campaign with three Ivy League home contests, the Crimson was hoping to hone its systems and chemistry a bit more than it did. A 5-2 loss to Yale (2-2-0, 2-2-0) tainted the home stand and exposed some areas in need of improvement.
Whether Harvard has improved in these facets or not, the meat of the schedule—marked by five consecutive bouts with ranked opponents—is fast approaching.
“I’m excited to go on the road. We have, I would say, five of our 10 most important games coming up on this road stretch,” tri-captain Jake Horton said. “After this weekend, there are definitely some things that are going to take some time to correct…. Ready or not, here it comes, so we’re excited for the challenge.”
Colgate has been an ECAC bottom-dweller in recent years, winning fewer than a third of its games in each of the past two seasons. That isn’t stopping Crimson coach Ted Donato ’91 from anticipating a tough matchup in Hamilton, N.Y., on Friday.
“We play a Colgate team that is coming off getting three out of four points on the weekend,” said the bench boss after last Saturday’s victory over Brown. “They’re feeling good about themselves. [And] they’re tough at home…. This will be a good test for us, to be on the road.”
The Crimson’s tilt with the Raiders will test a young forward group’s resolve to get pucks through Point’s pads. Through eight starts this year, the Raiders netminder leads the nation in goals against average (1.05) and save percentage (.965). Plus, Point has finished just one of these games with a denial rate below 95 percent.
Colgate’s lock-down style of play will present new challenges for Harvard, a team accustomed to racking up goals against the opposition. In preparation for the clash of playing styles, the Crimson has focused on getting pucks deep into the offensive zone and earning gritty opportunities down low near the goal.
“Get pucks in behind their [defense],” Horton said. “You’re not going to beat a goalie like [Point] straight up on a shot. It’s going to take second, third, fourth chances to score goals. That’s been the emphasis this week.”
Point’s stellar play early on this season has certainly been impressive, but it would not have been possible without the sound defensive effort in front of him. Manning the back end, junior Willie Brooks and freshman Nick Austin have been taking care of business on both sides of the puck. The rookie leads his team’s blue line in scoring with three goals and two assists, while Brooks looks to improve upon a solid 2016-2017 campaign, which featured a strike against Harvard in the teams’ Jan. 28th meeting.
On the attack, sophomores Bobby McMann (3–4—7) and John Snodgrass (1–5—6), as well as freshman Josh McKechney (0–6—6), comprise the trio of forwards that has carried much of the offensive load through ten games.
Staring 200 feet down the ice at Point on Friday will be Harvard’s own brick wall. Tri-captain Merrick Madsen, fresh off his second shutout in three contests, is trailing Point in goals against average (1.67) by just five spots on the Division-I leaderboard. These two net protectors could easily steal the show and transform Friday’s bout into a goaltender showcase.
Regardless of how the game shakes out, the Crimson will have to ratchet up its intensity for the Big Red the next night. Year in and year out, Harvard players anticipate the matchup at Lynah—a credit to Cornell students for packing the rink and welcoming the Crimson to Ithaca with a heavy dose of Ivy League hostility.

“You get so engaged in the game. That’s what college hockey is,” Horton said reverently. “The band’s going crazy, the chants against you, it’s just a really cool atmosphere to play in…. More than anything, it should just help everybody rise to the occasion.”
Loud, rambunctious, hostile, overwhelming—these are all adequate descriptors of the yearly Harvard-at-Cornell showdown. But perhaps most of all, Saturday’s face-off will be downright…fishy?
In a tradition dating back to 1963, Big Red students assail the Crimson with fish when the team takes the ice before the national anthem. As strange as it is fun, the annual seafood shower is part of what makes the rivalry between these two teams so special.
“[Coach] doesn’t really say much [about it],” Ryan Donato said with a smile. “He just says watch out for the fish. But it’s really cool watching the freshmen see that for their first time.”
With the ruckus completely surrounding the players, staying focused on what transpires within the glass is that much more difficult. Adding to the challenge for Harvard, a handful of freshmen in the lineup will experience Lynah’s fish-flinging, intense atmosphere for the first time.
“We’re going to have to talk to the guys who are a little less experienced or freshmen and say, ‘Hey listen, you have to keep your head within the glass,’” said Donato, a leader of his team’s attacking ranks. “There’s going to be a lot of times where you’re laughing at the crowd…and you can’t really let that distract you from your game.”
Horton’s first experience playing at Cornell left such an impression that he convinced his parents to travel from Oakdale, Minn., just to see Lynah in peak form before he graduates.
“By the time you get to this point in your career, you’ve played in some cool atmospheres—on the world stage, different things like that,” Horton said. “But I remember the first time that I played at Lynah, I was like ‘this is the coolest atmosphere I’ve ever played in, in my life.’ It was to the point where I told my parents, ‘you guys need to come see a game at Cornell before I graduate.’”
Once the puck drops, though, everything happening around the ice is mere background noise.
Barring an unlikely defeat to Dartmouth (2-2-0, 2-1-0) on Friday, the Big Red will enter Saturday’s matchup as the sole remaining unbeaten team in the ECAC. Between Cornell’s on-ice strength and its boisterous home environment, the Crimson will definitely clash with its most challenging foe to date.
Leading the charge for the Big Red up front, senior forward Trevor Yates has notched four goals and two helpers through four games. While the alternate captain sets the club’s scoring pace, Cornell more importantly has benefitted from steady balance throughout its lineup early in the season: nine players have at least three points through the team’s first two weekends of play.
As if the formidable forward corps and craze inside Lynah didn’t present enough of a challenge for Harvard, coach Donato’s squad will have to solve another stellar goalie this weekend.
Despite being yanked from last week’s contest against Princeton after allowing three first-period goals, rookie netminder Matthew Galajda sits among the NCAA top-five in both goals against average (1.51) and save percentage (.938).
A night of stingy goaltending and flying fish will only be made more difficult by the Crimson’s schedule leading up Saturday. The recent win over Brown and Friday’s bout with Colgate cannot possibly prepare Harvard for the roller coaster in Ithaca. The dip in intensity between last week’s Yale matchup and the upcoming Cornell showdown will test the Harvard icemen’s ability to ramp up the emotions for big games. Donato doesn’t seem too worried, however.
“Everybody’s really, really excited for every weekend,” the junior said. “[Emotional intensity] won’t really be an issue. Especially against Cornell, their crowd is unbelievable and it’s really hard to not be in the game there because it’s honestly one of the best atmospheres in college hockey.”
