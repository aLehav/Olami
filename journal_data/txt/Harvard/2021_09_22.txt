After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s vacillation on Covid-19 policy in the first few weeks of the semester highlights something wrong with the University’s current approach. It’s essential to get these policies right to allow maximum freedom while avoiding an uptick in cases that would necessitate stricter restrictions. But the University’s current policies suggest that Harvard is sacrificing the quality of life and safety of community members to save money.
I understand that funding for University and College programs is not infinite. I’m also grateful that we have in-person classes and dining and can visit each other’s rooms. However, Harvard University Health Services and the Dean of Students Office have been discouraging social interactions while not doing nearly everything possible to prevent the spread of the virus on campus. The University should be doing more of what it can to ensure our safety instead of discouraging socializing and meeting new people.
In an email to the Harvard community, HUHS Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote, “We have learned so far that parties” (i.e., eating and drinking, removing masks, moving around a room, and talking with multiple people) “are key factors in exposing students to infection risk.” The email suggested masking in all situations and that students limit social interactions to mitigate the risk from indoor parties.
But the email did nothing to describe what the University is doing to help limit the virus’s spread in party situations. I can list here three things that Harvard should be doing, but all require funding.
The first is HEPA filters in each room in every suite. The CDC recommends ventilation improvements as part of its layered approach to fighting transmission. In multiple emails to residential students in the 2020-2021 academic year, administrators recommended continuously running in-room HEPA filters at the highest setting.
The cost of such a program is unclear. Seemingly, the University decided to do away with requiring HEPA filters in every residential and common space this fall. (Last year, all bedrooms and seemingly every open space were serviced by University-provided HEPA filters.) Where are the filters now? In storage? And if they were rented, we need to rent them again.
The second is daily testing. Common sense tells us that daily testing is more effective than the current tri-weekly testing cadence. Best-case scenario, we catch an infection two days early. In the worst-case, we lose, well, nothing except money. More than doubling test frequency would be expensive, but it is worth it if it helps stop the spread of a virus that has taken the lives of more than 675,000 Americans and continues to suffocate our communities. Realistically, aside from financial considerations, increasing testing frequency is only a logistical issue, which we should be prepared for should cases rise.
The third is easily accessible outdoor social and party spaces. If Harvard wants to reduce infection from indoor partying, the answer should be to encourage students to move outside. Many houses and dorms have courtyards and ample outdoor space, but others such as Adams House, whose main courtyard is under construction, and the Inn at Harvard do not. Moreover, many of the Houses that do have outdoor spaces have little furniture besides lounge chairs. Tents and tables are economical and would be much appreciated.
In another email, Dr. Nguyen noted that eating and drinking at mealtimes is partly responsible for the spread of Covid-19 at the University. But again, some of the proposed remedies seem to encourage student action while the University stands idle concerning community health and the student experience. For example, the email suggests that students “dine in small parties of 2-4 people,” “avoid table-hopping,” and “consider dining consistently with the same small group of people rather than a different group at every meal of the day.”
This last point is almost laughable. How can students with different and ever-changing schedules seriously be expected to eat with the same people at each meal? Moreover, what’s the point of in-person dining if we eat with the same two to four people at each meal? Instead, the University should increase dining hours to reduce congestion and create large-scale outdoor dining spaces, which could be used well into the semester. Both these ideas would be complex logistically, considering the politics of Harvard University Dining Services labor and the extent of House outdoor spaces, not to mention the potential cost.
But I argue that this and other costs are worth it if they help students maximize their experience during this difficult time. At some point, the University must take more of a responsibility for the spread of Covid-19. Before asking students to give up important parts of their college experience again, administrators should ask themselves what more they can do to stop the spread without compromising student life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Ants are everywhere, but only occasionally noticed.”
There is a “possibly apocryphal” story about the British naturalist J.B.S. Haldane responding to a group of theologians who asked what he could tell them of the Creator given his extensive study of God’s creations. Haldane responded, perhaps in a snide way befitting of the British, “An inordinate fondness for beetles.” At the time of the telling of this story, there were only one million known species of animals, of which roughly 75 percent were insects. A large fraction of that was beetles.
Today, we know of more than 8.7 million species of animals, 350,000 of which are beetles. Although this is the kind of fact you may have read on the back of a children’s cereal box or tucked in the inside cover of a science magazine, I am willing to bet that you didn’t know it. Even more so, how many kinds of beetles can you name? Five? Ten? One hundred? I’m the one writing about beetles, and I barely know 20.
The number of species of beetles in the world teaches us something valuable. Sure, there are the usual remarks about how it makes us feel insignificant, that we aren’t alone, and that we should treat the Earth with more care. Perhaps if you are a Christian — like those questioning Haldane — you will start to look upon beetles more fondly so as to be closer in mind with the Creator. Barring these first two reactions, what we should draw from this fact is that we spend much of our lives missing things. Perhaps some of them are important?
I was once taking photos of a heron at Mount Auburn Cemetery. It was preening itself in a tree, displaying all of its feathered elegance. It, of course, knew that I had neglected to bring the proper lens and, thus, was taunting me as old foes are wont to do.
I crept to the edge of the pond and sat. I was seven feet away from this splendid bird. My instinct was to hold my breath, freeze my muscles, not disturb the creature. But as I thought this, many people passed by jabbering in a way most akin to seagulls. Not one of them stopped to look at the heron. They, like us with the beetles, were completely unaware. They were more focused on lamenting the loss of their dinner parties to one another than on witnessing a magnificent bird in its natural habitat, adjusting its feathers in preparation to soar through the air.
I imagine this is what most Harvard students are like. We walk around talking about recruiting, asking people to grab meals, and worrying about our problem sets. This process of talking, asking, worrying inevitably leads to details missed, subtleties foregone. There are cases where this cannot be helped. We do need to find jobs, eat food, and do our problem sets. The important thing is to remember to look around, watch the bird, count the beetles, when the other things become less pressing. Assigning salience to the previously unnoticed is a necessary skill.
Should the takeaway from this be that you should immediately go and learn the names of more beetles or sit in Mount Auburn Cemetery until you see the heron? Probably not. However, I sincerely hope that you might set this article down and look around you. And if I have done a good enough job, you, like Haldane and the beetles, may even start to notice new counts in your own life.
How many steps do you take a day? How many people in your life love you? How many times a day do you make someone laugh? Previously unknown numbers can become points of comfort, even pride. It is amazing that there are 350,000 species of beetles. You should be amazed. Similarly, you, dear reader, have read over 600 words at this point. That is a lot of words. But even if each of those words had 500 beetles on it, it still wouldn’t be all the species of beetles in the world.
What might help is if we all were more aware of the things in life that we never thought about before. How many times do you think of that person each day? Maybe you should tell them. How many books are there in your favorite library, and by extension how many authors? Maybe you should go read them. But most simply, what do you not know? Why don’t you? What’s stopping you? It doesn’t have to be the names of all the beetles. It could start with the names of all the Beatles. It could start with all the people you love. It could start with why the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
There are many ants that are unnoticed, yet they are everywhere. Start noticing them. I am not here to tell you what to go find out or what to notice, just that you notice something. And if you are lucky, you’ll find a story worth telling, an inordinate fondness of your own.

To President Bacow and the Fellows of Harvard College:
As members of Harvard University Faculty for Divestment, we thank you for your recent statement regarding Harvard’s response to the climate crisis. We appreciate and commend you for your acknowledgment that fossil fuel investments are imprudent, and for your pledge to stop investing in companies that explore for new fossil fuel reserves.
Your new position is an important step and a testament to the power of sustained social justice activism. It is also a reminder of how much we owe to the student activists of Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, and to student activists on campuses around this country and around the world. They have helped us understand the urgency of the crisis and the responsibility we have, in our positions of privilege and power, to act commensurately.
At the same time, as with all aspects of Harvard’s climate action plan, transparency regarding specific plans and a firm timeline is critical. Your statement says nothing about continued direct investments in fossil fuel companies that generate profits from the extraction and sale of fossil fuels as long as they do not “explore for new reserves.” According to these criteria, the endowment might continue to invest directly in, for example, in the destruction of indigenous lands and waters for the construction of fracked gas pipelines. Also, the “less than 2% of the endowment” still invested in fossil fuels through private equity funds could translate to over $800 million supporting industries that continue to harm our health and our planet. We feel it is important for Harvard to provide deadlines for divestment of these funds as well.
We hope you will address these concerns with the transparency and forthrightness that Harvard leadership, at its best, exemplifies.
Respectfully,
Harvard Faculty for Divestment

More than 120 members and supporters of five Harvard unions at various stages of contract negotiations with the University jointly rallied for contracts and benefits in front of the John Harvard statue in Harvard Yard Tuesday, chanting, “What do we want? Contracts! When do we want them? Now!”
The custodians and security officers union 32BJ SEIU; Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers; Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers; Harvard University Security, Parking, and Museum Guards Union; and the dining employees union UNITE HERE Local 26 organized the rally.
Local 26 reached a tentative agreement with the University Friday after four months of negotiations, according to Local 26 Executive Vice President Michael Kramer. HUCTW and HGSU-UAW have been bargaining for four months and six months, respectively. HUSPMGU is in the process of planning bargaining sessions, according to HUSPMGU President Curt E. Rheault. According to 32BJ SEIU Vice President Roxana L. Rivera, 32BJ is heading to the bargaining table in October.
HGSU-UAW Vice President Marisa J. Borreggine and 32BJ SEIU member and custodian Nilton de Jesus introduced speakers throughout the rally, starting with Kramer and shop steward Aaron J. Duckett. Though the union already reached a tentative agreement with Harvard, Kramer said, Local 26 still supports other unions in their negotiations.
“It’s an agreement that protects our jobs and meets the core concerns that we went into these negotiations,” Kramer said at the rally. “But this isn’t done, because again, it’s not just the unity of our members. It’s the unity of all 12,000 workers represented here.”
HUCTW Recording Secretary Danielle Boudrow said HUCTW members have found “creative solutions” to complete work despite obstacles created by the pandemic and deserve increased compensation.
“We paid for office furniture out of our own budget,” she said. “We put in hundreds of additional hours of work to get Harvard’s mission done. HUCTW members deserve salary increases and benefits that recognize our efforts and help us move forward with our lives.”
According to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton, Harvard has provided $40 million to idled workers and $15 million to idled contracted workers from March 2020 to April 2021 in compensation and benefits and has extended 70 percent pay for idled employees until the end of the year. Individual schools and units are determining pay for idled contracted workers.
Rheault, the HUSPMGU president, spoke next at the rally about the proposal to merge HUSPMGU and HUCTW. Harvard has rejected merger proposals in 2016 and in 2019, citing policy concerns.
“You say, ‘Well, why does it take five years?’” Rheault said. “That’s because we only have eighty people in our bargaining unit, and that’s also the reason why Harvard can try to take advantage of us.”
In an interview after the rally, Rheault said the merger with HUCTW, a union representing more than 5,000 people, would lend more bargaining power to HUSPMGU, a union with eighty workers.
“They won’t let us join HUCTW, and we don’t have much purchasing power, really, to get the wages we need,” he said.
Massachusetts State Representative Mike Connolly; Cambridge city councilors Marc McGovern, Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Quinton Y. Zondervan; Cambridge Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui; Waltham city councilor Jonathan Paz; and Boston City Councilors Kenzie Bok and Lydia Edwards delivered remarks in support of the workers.
“That sense of solidarity, that sense of worker organizing at Harvard — that’s a beacon of hope for workers all over the country,” Sobrinho-Wheeler said.
Rivera, the vice president of 32BJ, spoke next about the importance of union solidarity, leading chants in both English and Spanish. Dominick De Loretta, a security officer at Harvard, shared concerns over healthcare and reiterated the need for a contract.
“How can we be in the best country in the world, working for the greatest university in the world, but not having the best contract in the world?” De Loretta asked.
Multiple speakers mentioned that unlike other unions on campus, HGSU-UAW’s current contract had no provisions for a grievance procedure for sexual harassment and discrimination ending in third-party arbitration. The University has proposed in August an appeals process for certain types of non-gender-based discrimination that could end in neutral arbitration.
HGSU-UAW President Brandon J. Mancilla said inter-union conversations began as Harvard unions realized many of their issues were similar.
“We were talking about negotiations and we all realized, ‘Hey, we have real struggles, and we need to talk to one another,’” he said.
HGSU-UAW member Jen L. Cruz spoke about the graduate student union’s issues at the bargaining table. Cruz spoke on the union’s proposal to remove the pay disparity for School of Public Health teaching fellows and Harvard’s acceptance of the proposal.
Tarina K. Ahuja ’24 wrote that she decided to attend the rally after learning about it on the First-Year Urban Program listserv.
“Harvard workers — HUDS staff, custodians, museum workers, graduate students, librarians — these are the people who take care of us and teach us,” she wrote. “It is our obligation to stand in unequivocal solidarity with them and to amplify them in this fight.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About a month after Harvard’s campus came back to life, University President Lawrence S. Bacow lauded the efficacy of Harvard’s Covid-19 protocols and the willingness of students, faculty, and staff to follow them.
Despite an initial spike in cases on campus, Bacow said in an interview Tuesday he was “very pleased” with adherence to indoor mask requirements, noting the University has avoided any severe outbreaks.
“We will always have some level of infection on campus, unfortunately, until this virus disappears completely, but we’re managing to keep it under control right now,” he said.
During the week of Aug. 29, 135 Harvard affiliates tested positive for the virus, including 95 undergraduates. Bacow said the University had anticipated a spike in cases with students returning from around the globe.
“We knew that we had people who were returning to campus who had not been through the same kind of strict testing regimen as they would encounter when they were here,” he said. “So there were people who actually came back infected.”
The school increased the mandatory testing cadence for residents of undergraduate housing on campus on Sept. 2, hiking the requirement from weekly to three times per week. Bacow said the shift was driven primarily by rising cases at peer institutions, such as Duke and Cornell. Still, he defended the decision to start the term with a lower testing cadence.
“We’re trying to always find what represents the right point to land, where we’re not being too intrusive in terms of what we’re asking people to do but where the benefits are worth the costs,” Bacow said. “When we started out, we thought that we were in the right spot.”
“It was less the increase of cases on our campus, which was still quite modest compared to what other campuses saw,” he added.
Bacow noted the University has shifted to relying on its own Covid-19 testing facility, which he said has reduced costs given the high number of tests.
Case rates on campus have dropped off since the first weeks, with a 0.16 percent overall campus positivity rate during the last seven days. Harvard University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen said the University has yet to identify any Covid-19 transmission in a classroom setting.
Bacow also said in the Tuesday interview that the University is planning to hold in-person Commencement Exercises for the Class of 2022 this spring.
“We’re proceeding under the assumption that it will be in-person,” he said.
The school has also pledged to hold ceremonies for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, which each received a virtual graduation ceremony due to the pandemic. Bacow reiterated that promise Tuesday, saying that Harvard is planning to hold them in the spring. He declined to provide further details, but said he hoped to make a formal announcement this semester.
“We want to make sure that when we announce the date, we are prepared to answer all of the questions which will inevitably follow,” Bacow said. “People are working feverishly right now trying to put those plans in place.”

After negotiating for four months and engaging a federal mediator, Harvard University and its dining workers union, UNITE HERE Local 26, reached a tentative agreement for a new five-year contract Friday.
The tentative agreement includes a 15 percent increase in compensation, according to Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton. Local 26 chief shop steward Aaron J. Duckett added in an interview that it will prevent Harvard from slashing dining workers’ jobs — a fear of the union’s going into negotiations.
Dining workers will vote on whether to ratify the contract Thursday, according to an email from Harvard University Dining Services Managing Director Smitha S. H. Haneef obtained by The Crimson.
Local 26 Executive Vice President Michael Kramer said he was “proud” of the tentative agreement at a pro-union rally in Harvard Yard Tuesday.
“It’s an agreement that shows that our members aren’t just essential when they’re performing work during a pandemic, but that they’re essential members of the Harvard community,” he said. “It’s an agreement that shows this institution, which is weathering the pandemic just fine, isn’t going to stop our members from continuing to move forward.”
Newton added the University is “pleased” to have a tentative agreement with the union.
“We believe this contract is a fair deal with our dining workers. We are grateful to all who played a role in this bargaining session,” he wrote in an emailed statement.
Job security was a recurring issue for Local 26 during contract negotiations. Over the summer, the union rallied at the Law School over concerns that some formerly contracted dining workers would be laid off during their transition into HUDS.
Last month, after HUDS management released preliminary work schedules to the union for next year, dining workers alleged HUDS was cutting 8 percent of total hours in the residential dining halls and flyered campus, soliciting student support. HUDS withdrew the proposed schedules on Sept. 1.
Duckett also said he believes the tentative agreement is built off of the union’s previous success in its 2016 contract negotiations. During that round of bargaining, hundreds of dining workers went on strike for 22 days, forcing a tentative agreement with the University.
“We had such a good 2016 that we felt that there was very little that was needed to be done in this contract,” he said. “We felt that this was a big victory to sustain our jobs.”

Harvard’s François-Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights launched an initiative to study and address structural racism in public health with a virtual symposium Tuesday.
The FXB Center, which is housed by the Harvard School of Public Health, created the Structural Racism Initiative for Diversity with Equity program earlier this year to research “racism as a determinant of health, as a root cause of health inequalities,” per the event’s website.
To generate this research, the center hired a class of fellows, including three social epidemiologists, a researcher in medical sociology, and a public health researcher and activist.
FXB Center Executive Director Natalia Linos said in an interview that she was excited about the diversity of the cohort, noting that four of the five identify as people of color.
“I hope that our model of bringing a group of scholars of color to work together and create a kind of community can be a model for academic centers,” Linos said.
The FXB Center has been conceptualizing STRIDE for a couple years, according to Linos. The initiative was inspired by the center’s director, Mary T. Bassett, who served as commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for four years and worked to highlight and address structural racism in the city’s health care system, Linos added.
“The FXB Center is the center that does work on health and human rights, traditionally doing work globally,” she said. “[Bassett] said it’s time for us to think about health and human rights in this country, in the United States.”
Tuesday’s STRIDE symposium, “Anti-Racism in Public Health Policies, Practice, and Research,” was the first in a series of discussions featuring Harvard professors as well as public health experts and advocates.
HSPH Dean Michelle A. Williams welcomed participants to the symposium, citing the past year’s “national reckoning around structural racism.”
“This reckoning led my colleagues and I to declare that racism is a public health crisis and to examine what we can do in academia,” Williams said.
The symposium, which Linos said aimed to draw out the ties of the present to the past and of the local to the global, began with a conversation on the history of racism affecting health and health care.
In that conversation, professors Evelynn M. Hammonds and Khalil Gibran Muhammad discussed slavery, Reconstruction, and redlining.
“In order to understand how racism became deeply embedded in American institutions, you have to look at it historically, and public health and medicine are certainly institutions where this has certainly been true,” Hammonds said.
The next two panels explored the similarities between the experiences of ethnic minorities in the United States and those around the world.
The first panel of the symposium covered the effects of structural racism in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. The speakers, who included scholars from the HSPH, Drexel University, and the National Health Service Race and Health Observatory in the United Kingdom, discussed racism’s systemic damage to public health as well as the need for innovation and grassroots leadership to dismantle it.
The second panel, “Anti-Racism in Public Health Policies and Practice in the U.S.,” with scholars from the HSPH, Georgia State University, and the American Medical Association, discussed the effects of racism on data collection and analysis in the United States and ways to encourage anti-racist education nationwide.
After the symposium, Linos said she was “very, very pleased” with the event’s turnout and audience engagement in the question-and-answer sessions.
“Our hope with this kind of work is that we bridge different audiences,” Linos said. “We also want to make it accessible to community groups, who want to use some of this data for advocacy; we also want impacted communities to feel like they’re part of the conversation.”

As the Boston Planning and Development Agency proceeds with its review of Harvard’s proposed Enterprise Research Campus, developers, University representatives, and Allston residents met virtually Tuesday to discuss plans to improve local transportation.
This latest Harvard Allston Task Force meeting convened following the filing of Tishman Speyer’s Draft Impact Project Report — a document released July 28 outlining the developer’s additional commitment to affordable housing.
The meeting also addressed the firm’s 18-page Planned Development Area document filed earlier this month. This PDA document concerns the initial “Phase A” of the ERC and covers everything from building appearance to traffic circulation.
The filing will facilitate zoning for the project in the future, according to BPDA Senior Institutional Planner Nupooor Monani.
Michael Regan, an adviser to the Tishman Speyer team and managing director for transportation consulting firm Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, offered a broad overview of the developers’ transportation designs.
Regan said developers plan to construct new “multi-modal” streets that enable various forms of transportation, including on- and off-street bicycling and walking paths.
The ERC will feature separated and protected bike lanes, space for potential seating areas or outdoor retail, and greenery, according to Lee Altman, director of design management at urban design firm SCAPE.
Altman added the development will include four designated drop-off areas to serve rideshare and demand delivery services to reduce conflicts among drivers, bicyclists, pedestrians, and visitors to the ERC’s hotel and conference center.
Regan said a possible effect of the influx of people into Allston as a result of the ERC may be worsened passenger crowding on buses operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
To address these transit pressures, Regan offered a three-part plan including partnering with Harvard to offer supplemental shuttle services.
Regan said developers are also seeking to mitigate the build-up of traffic on local roads by unbundling the price of parking from the cost of residential units and offering a subsidized bike maintenance program.
Task Force member Cindy Marchando complimented developers on their outreach, but said she fears projections for the number of vehicles are understated and that the drop-off areas will be insufficient.
“We will have major gridlock on Western Ave. just by the mere fact of the conference center,” Marchando said.
Regan said traffic analysis has taken into consideration the impact of the conference center and that event planners will avoid overlapping events and will take advantage of all curb space to prevent gridlock.
Task Force member Tim McHale said despite the developers’ outlines, he believes they are still lacking a comprehensive transportation plan and fears the ERC will begin to face transit issues like Boston’s Seaport district.
“Show me an innovative district being planned that does not address the fundamental issue of moving enormous amounts of people,” he said. “Well, actually, we did it in the Seaport, and we all know how that turned out.”

All three of Harvard’s schools at its Longwood campus have transitioned back to the primarily in-person instruction that is vital to the clinical curriculum, with administrators reporting that Covid-19 protocols there are effectively preventing transmission.
Harvard Medical School retained some of its in-person curriculum through hybrid formats throughout the pandemic, but has pivoted this semester to focus on teaching in person, according to Lisa M. Muto ’79, HMS executive dean of administration.
The number of Covid-19 cases at the Longwood campus is very low, and there has been “no evidence of on-campus transmission,” Muto said.
The Harvard School of Dental Medicine also maintained clinical instruction in person last year, and has successfully restored its full program on campus this semester.
“You can’t really teach dentistry unless it’s hands-on,” said Charles H. Frizzell, the Dental School’s dean for administration and finance.
“We haven’t really had any clusters at all — no transmission between practitioner and patient or vice versa, very nominal number of cases, and they tend to be something that happens outside,” Frizzell said. “It’s not really being transmitted here.”
At the School of Public Health — which went completely virtual last year — most classes are back in person, but some large classes have had to stay online, due to the limited number of large classrooms on the Longwood campus.
“All of our courses are on campus with the exception of a few very large ones, where we really don’t have classrooms large enough to accommodate them, so they continue to be online,” said Katie Hope, HSPH executive dean for administration.
Adherence to Covid-19 regulations, according to both administrators and students, has been high.
“[The low case rates are] due to people being compliant with the rules,” Muto said. “All of our policies are in alignment with University policies, and there is a real culture of safety in the science world.”
Julia Healey, a master’s student at HSPH, said students she knows are all taking mask and vaccination requirements seriously.
“It lets everyone feel a bit safer on campus to know that everyone’s adhering to those policies,” she said.
While the return to the classroom has largely gone smoothly, some students said they were less satisfied with Harvard’s handling of residential life on the Longwood campus. The only residential hall in Longwood is Vanderbilt Hall, which mostly houses first-year medical and dental students.
Masking is required in all hall spaces and students must test once a week. According to Marium M. Raza, a first-year medical student living in Vanderbilt, student lounges and communal kitchens were originally open to all in-residence students this semester, but in late August, they were locked and kitchens were restricted to two people at a time.
Raza, vice president of advocacy on HMS and HSDM’s student council, said she was told these restrictions resulted from some lack of compliance with masking.
Student representatives are “in conversations” with facilities staff about when those measures could be relaxed, she added.
Yoseph D. Boku ’21, president of the student council, wrote in an emailed statement that he believes procedures for reopening social spaces in Vanderbilt — where he also lives — have been unclear and lacked student input.
He also noted that first-year medical students living off-campus do not have access to Vanderbilt Hall, complicating any social event planning for first-year students.
Despite strict regulations in the residential hall, some noted there have been numerous opportunities to get to know their classmates better, albeit outside.
“I’m doing gatherings outside as well, which has been a lot of fun,” said Michael Friedman, a first-year dental student living in Vanderbilt.
Healey said she and many of her peers have enjoyed getting to see one another in person after a year of online classes.
“Everyone I’ve talked to, other students, have really enjoyed the environment of being back on campus, getting to do group work actually together in person,” she said.
Several Longwood students said they felt Harvard should be more clear in communicating Covid-19 protocols, especially with the patchwork of University, Boston, and hospital-specific guidelines students there have to follow.
“I feel with everything that’s happening and trying to do classwork, that if there was just one consistent [rule] across the board or policies that are across the board, that can be helpful,” Friedman said.
Tyler S. LeComer ’19, a second-year at the Medical School, said he believes the past virtual year has created a “major disconnect” between the HMS administration and his class. Last year, he said, the student government served as the only pipeline between students and administrators.
“From students to administration, there was no direct interaction like there would be in a typical year,” LeComer said. “I think that that is part of what made it difficult to get students and administration in the same room talking about what Covid regulations might look like.”
Administrators said the Longwood schools keep web pages up-to-date with the latest Covid-19 guidelines. Hope noted that though transparency and communication is important, school leaders have to respect people’s privacy and HIPAA rights.
Frizzell said the schools maintain “constant communication” with students amid the rapidly changing health situation.
“We take every opportunity we can to communicate because a lot of the rules have changed — they keep changing,” he said. “We try to get out the information as much as we can, without confusing everybody at the same time.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a one and a half year hiatus from all collegiate tennis competitions, the Crimson men’s tennis team came back with a vengeance this past weekend at the Milwaukee Tennis Classic, where the team sent four of its top members to compete. Harvard capped off an incredibly strong showing at the tournament with sophomore Henry von der Schulenburg taking home the individual title in the singles bracket.
“We were all really happy to be out there and we’re all grateful to be able to travel during COVID, and I think not every team has been able to do that,” said von der Schulenburg. “And you practice so much during COVID and couldn’t play in tournaments, and this is exactly what you do it for. I think we’re all really happy with the result.”
The sophomore played a whopping nine matches over the course of the weekend from Saturday through Monday afternoon, winning eight of nine. Von Der Schulenburg secured victories in straight sets throughout the tournament in singles competitions, capping off his performance in the final with a 6-3, 6-2 win over nationally-ranked Lodewijk Weststrate of Southern California. In doubles, von der Schulenburg partnered with junior Harry Walker to earn a second place finish after falling in the final to a duo from Pepperdine, 6-2.
After the match, the sophomore felt a huge sense of relief and pride in knowing that so much of the work he had put in over the pandemic, while living in Switzerland away from the rest of the team, was finally starting to pay off.
“I mean, I maybe played a handful of matches over the past year and a half, just in Switzerland, so it was a great feeling, and even though it was an individual win, I think this will give our whole team confidence. It’ll help all of us believe that we’re a force to be reckoned with,” said von der Schulenburg. “It was also amazing to see that even in Milwaukee we had some fans that were Harvard alumni come and watch and support us. It’s so cool to have people from Harvard come from all over the place to support you.”
Senior Brian Shi and sophomore Ronan Jachuck also put up strong showings at the tournament, with Shi winning his first two matches, the first in straight sets and the second in a hard-fought battle against the No. 1 seed in the tournament and nationally-ranked Ronnie Hohmann of LSU in the quarterfinals. The senior came out with a winning result in three sets, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
As for how the team is feeling after this positive performance all around, von der Schulenburg feels very optimistic.
“I think we all got a bit more confident, and I think that we all know that if we play well together we can be a really good team,” said the Switzerland native. “And that’s our mindset now going into every tournament, that we’re not just some Ivy League that is somehow Division 1, but we’re actually one of the better teams in the country and can go really far. I think other teams are definitely going to respect us more now than ever before.”
Von der Schulenburg also noted that while each and every athlete on the team trained consistently over the pandemic and improved parts of their game, still nothing has compared to being back on campus together again as one team.
“It’s so much easier to practice and dig deeper, and it’s so much more fun, especially being a tennis player and usually being by yourself,” said the sophomore. You get used to that, but having a team around you has such a big influence on you and your game. You know that if you’re having a bad day, your teammates are there to hype you up. I think that’s what makes college tennis so special, and I think we all really missed that.”
After a long and grueling pandemic, the Crimson men were eager to get off to a hot start, and with the success they had this weekend they accomplished just that. With a slugfest against Florida, winners of the national championship this past spring, on the horizon this weekend in Cambridge at the Chowder Fest tournament, Harvard will look to continue their early success and prove why they deserve to be considered one of the top teams in the nation.
