After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the Loeb Dance Studio, two dancers from the Harvard Ballet Company run through a piece choreographed to the opening theme of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey." The piece is one of many that comprises the space-themed "Out of Orbit," a collaborative project between the Harvard Ballet Company and the Harvard Pops Orchestra. "Out of Orbit" will combine classical ballet and music from popular film, classical composers, and contemporary artists to bring outer space to the Loeb Mainstage.
“[Harvard Ballet Company] wanted to try and move away from a ‘recital’ type of show,” co-director Mara G. Milner ’20 says. “We wanted to blend something together that had the fun aspects of Pops and that still maintained the professionalism [of] a ballet company.” “Out of Orbit” is a stylistic departure from the company’s typical productions, but Milner hopes that the collaboration with the Pops will engage a wider range of audiences.
Milner explains that “Out of Orbit” will not follow a strict storyline, but will instead explore distinct energies, moods, and themes by way of its many individual pieces. Alexandra D. Caffrey ’19, a dancer and co-producer, describes each piece as driven by different ideas of space that a choreographer had in mind.
“People are taking ‘space’ very literally in certain pieces… In other pieces, it’s more of an abstract idea,” says Caffrey. The choreography to one piece, she mentions, was inspired by eclipses; to another, by constellations. The music is also tied to the theme.
“[Pops] really experiments with different types of music, and has fun with it,” says Harvard Pops Orchestra co-president Leah U. Rosen ’19. Rosen lists Star Wars film scores, Elton John’s “Rocket Man,” and Debussy’s “Clair de Lune” as a few of the many space-themed musical pieces that will accompany the ballet onstage. “I’m hoping that we’re each going to bring the best of our groups to this collaboration: there’ll be music that’s fun and accessible, [and] beautiful, really amazing dance.”
“I hope that people who have never considered seeing a dance show before will find [“Out of Orbit”] an accessible and exciting production,” dancer Angie Cui ’20 says. Cui hopes something about “Out of Orbit”—whether its space theme, theatrical qualities, or combining several forms of media—will help bring dance and ballet to the forefront of performing arts at Harvard.
“Out of Orbit” will run from Mar. 29 to Apr. 7 on the Loeb Mainstage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In late February, Angela Ruggiero ‘04—a former Harvard ice hockey player—stepped down from her position on the International Olympic Committee Athlete’s Commission. The IOC is a group that represents all Olympic athletes across the world. She served on the IOC for eight years and before that played in four Olympic Games, winning a gold medal in 1998, two silvers in 2002 and 2010, and a bronze in 2006. She is also the all-time leader in games played for men or womens’ United States Ice Hockey. Ruggiero is considered one of the greatest female hockey players of all time and also one of the best Harvard Hockey players in history.
Angela Ruggiero ranks sixth in all-time career points at Harvard with 96 goals and 157 assists, for a total of 253 points. Ruggiero also won the Patty Kazmaier Award in 2004, which is given to the top player in U.S. women’s collegiate hockey. During her time at Harvard, the Crimson had a 109-13-5 record. In 2015, she was inducted in the Hockey Hall of fame, only the fourth women ever to receive that honor.
Ruggiero was elected to the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission in 2010. A few of the projects she has helped with while on the IOC include keeping the Winter Youth Olympic Games Lillehammer 2016 on track, advocating for women in the sports world, and also bringing the Olympics to Los Angeles- her hometown- in 2028. Another part of her role on the IOC includes giving out Olympic gold medals. Ruggiero placed the medals around the necks of the US Women’s soccer team in 2012, the US women’s basketball team in 2016, and on the US women’s hockey team about a month ago. Even though Ruggiero will no longer be on the International Olympic Committee she still plans to stay involved in the workings of the Olympics. Ruggiero is still on the ethics commission, the digital technology commission, the Beijing 2022 commission, and on the Olympic Channel board of directors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

At the historic Herb Brooks Arena in Lake Placid, N.Y., the puck had dropped on the first frame of overtime. Harvard and Clarkson were both fighting to keep their seasons alive. But as the Golden Knights pressed on, their surge proved too much for the Crimson to handle.
A perfect feed from the ECAC’s 2017-2018 Best Defensive Forward, sophomore Nico Sturm, found linemate Sheldon Rempal in the slot. Rempal, Clarkson’s leading scorer, made no mistake and found twine to cap off a dramatic comeback and end Harvard’s season all in one stroke.
The No. 10/8 Golden Knights (23-9-6, 12-5-5 ECAC) roared back from a three-goal deficit against the Crimson (15-14-4, 11-8-3), shutting the door on Harvard’s Whitelaw Cup defense. The Crimson held a comfortable 4-1 lead after potting a quick goal just six seconds into the third, but defensive setbacks and an opportunistic Clarkson offense opened the door for the opposition to force overtime.
“[Clarkson] kept coming, so we give them a lot of credit,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I’m real proud of [our players], they gave their heart and soul…. It’s always tough at the end, but I’m very proud of our guys.”
The Crimson began the game looking confident, anchored by the solid play of tri-captain goalie Merrick Madsen. The backstop staved off 23 of the Golden Knights’ 24 shots through 40 minutes of play, appearing at ease as he stared down Clarkson’s quality chances. At the other end, Harvard’s power play was clicking as well as it had all season. The first two Crimson tallies both came with the man advantage.
Just past the halfway mark in the first period, sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce found the tape of rookie defenseman Reilly Walsh, who was positioned at the top of the right circle. Walsh’s one-timer zipped right past sophomore net-minder Jake Kielly a mere 20 seconds into the power play opportunity, and Harvard carried that 1-0 lead into the first intermission.
On Harvard’s next man-advantage chance, it was junior forward Lewis Zerter-Gossage who struck gold. Five minutes into the second, Zerter-Gossage collected a pass from sophomore blue-liner Adam Fox and beat Kielly at an impossible angle to the right of the goaltender. The junior’s 10th of the season put the Crimson up 2-0.
Soon after, junior Ryan Donato split the defense and tossed the puck on net. Ty Pelton-Byce, his sophomore linemate, picked up the rebound, and the biscuit slipped out of Kielly’s reach and into his net. Only a power play goal from Clarkson freshman forward Jack Jacome marred Harvard’s solid 40 minutes.
“We were playing pretty good hockey [even] when we were down,” said Clarkson head coach Casey Jones. “For me, it was a gutsy and a character win for us tonight.”
The real drama started when, a few seconds into the third, Golden Knights defenseman Kelly Summers misplayed the puck off a faceoff win, turning it over to Pelton-Byce. The sophomore capitalized fast with a high backhand, ostensibly putting the Crimson in prime position for success. Closing the game out, however, would prove difficult.
A drive from Clarkson sophomore Haralds Egle brought the Golden Knights back within two scores just seven seconds after Pelton-Byce’s tally, marking the beginning of the period-long Clarkson surge and reestablishing the back-and-forth nature of the two teams’ regular season series.
“We persevered [after the fourth goal],” Jones said. “It was a great shift after that to get us to 4-2.”
The next four minutes saw two more Golden Knights goals, courtesy of captain Nic Pierog and sophomore Devin Brosseau. These strikes in rapid succession were not unlike the three Clarkson notches in all of six minutes during the teams’ tilt back in January.
Where Friday’s tilt differed from the 6-6 draw was that Harvard never got one back. Though the teams traded zone time for the rest of the game, the Crimson failed to capitalize on any of its chances, from one-on-one looks to cycle plays. These missed opportunities will undoubtedly weigh heavy on the players’ minds this offseason and beyond.
“Every single day of practice, workouts—it all matters,” said tri-captain Eddie Ellis when asked about what the younger players could take away from the game and the season. “[I’d tell them] not to take a second of it for granted.”
The stinging defeat also means Harvard must say bittersweet goodbyes to its senior class. The fourth-years will graduate as one of the most successful groups in program history with 82 wins, and tri-captain Jake Horton finishes his collegiate career with 140 games in a Crimson uniform, good for the program record for most games played. Madsen, too, will leave an impact on Harvard’s record books (87 career GS, 2.12 GAA, .924 SV%).
“The seniors had four trips to Lake Placid, three trips to the NCAA [tournament],” coach Donato said. “It hurts a lot right now, but they can certainly hold their heads high…. The guys have created a culture and set the bar pretty high.”
Amid the seniors’ departure and the rookies’ growth, the ECAC semifinal loss also caps off a standout campaign from Ryan Donato, who logged two assists in the game. The recently-named ECAC Player of the Year accrued the accolades in the best year of his career (29 GP, 26–17—43), having sported the red, white, and blue in the Olympics and been named a Hobey Baker finalist.
In the coming days, Donato must choose to either contribute to the senior-based exodus and join the National Hockey League’s Boston Bruins or to return to his father’s bench for his senior season at Harvard. No matter his decision, coach Donato showed some optimism about the future of the program after Friday night’s bout.
“We needed to grow a lot throughout the year,” the bench boss said. “We have a lot of young guys…. We had a lot of growing pains, but...we feel that the future is bright.”
Harvard certainly had big shoes to fill after its storybook 2016-17 season, and this year was perhaps a more turbulent ride than the team would have liked. It is only fitting that in such an up-and-down year, an ECAC semifinal contest full of its own ups and downs ultimately determined the team’s fate.
All the Crimson can do now is bid farewell to the class of 2018, nominate its leadership corps for next season, and start the road back to achieving some of the milestones that it left on the table this year.
