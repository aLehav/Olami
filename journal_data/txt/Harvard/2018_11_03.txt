After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal said this week that the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center has asked him not to deliver a long-planned lecture in Cambridge as his family faces mounting scrutiny over the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
“I got notice… very politely saying ‘This may not be the right time for you to come and lecture because of the Khashoggi affair,’” the prince told the Daily Beast during an interview held in his Virginia home earlier this week.
Representatives for the Kennedy School and Prince Turki did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The move by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs to disinvite Prince Turki comes one month after Khashoggi — a Washington Post columnist and one-time ally of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — was killed under mysterious circumstances in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Representatives for the Saudi royal family, including Prince Turki, initially denied any involvement with Khashoggi’s death.
The family later admitted the killing was premeditated after Turkish authorities produced compelling evidence indicating the regime was responsible. Several analysts who study the Saudi royal family have said any order to kill Khashoggi must have earned the crown prince’s sign-off. Last month, Prince Turki said he was “shocked” by Khashoggi’s death, but that he stood behind Prince Mohammed.
Prince Turki said in the interview with the Daily Beast that he “simply can’t understand” why Harvard chose to cancel the lecture and accompanying residency, calling it “guilt by association.” Though the visit is not currently listed on the Belfer Center’s website, Prince Turki has visited the Kennedy School to give similar talks at least five times in the past 15 years.
“Someone like me who has not had anything to do with any of what is happening in the Kingdom, to be… stigmatized by innuendo… from an institution like Harvard,” he told the Daily Beast. “Academic engagement and people’s exchange of knowledge and knowhow should be encouraged, rather than stopped or interrupted.”
The aborted lecture is not the only link between Harvard and the Saudi royal. The Belfer Center’s Project on Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council Security “is made possible through a gift from HRH Prince Turki bin Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia,” according to its website.
The gift is one of several Harvard has received from members of the Saudi royal family. Saudi royals have also made donations to the Kennedy School, the Islamic Studies program, and the Extension School.
As recently as Oct. 24, the Kennedy School said it would not sever its ties with the Saudi regime. At the time, Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the Kennedy School, wrote in an emailed statement that the “Kennedy School has accepted money from Saudi Arabia for various research projects and teaching activities.” He added the school has “made no changes in that work” — a policy the cancelled lecture appears to contradict.
Harvard later told the Boston Globe that it is “following recent events with concern” and “assessing potential implications for existing programs” — but that it would “continue as before to welcome scholars and students from Saudi Arabia to the Harvard community.”
Correction: Nov. 7, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Harvard's Center for Middle Eastern Studies received donations from members of the Saudi royal family. In fact, the donations in question went to the school's Islamic Studies program.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seniors across Harvard’s soccer program will be celebrated this weekend when the men’s and women’s sides both play Columbia in their last games at Jordan Field this season. The women’s team will play at 1 p.m. on Saturday while the men’s team will play at 7 p.m. later that day.
The men’s team (3-11, 1-4 Ivy) looks to close out its season on a high note. Having lost its last six games, a span in which it has been outscored 12-2, the Crimson will need to improve its offense. Playing at Jordan Field this weekend could reignite its scoring attack as all the team’s victories this season have come at home. Harvard has a winning record in Cambridge with victories against competitive teams such as Providence (9-6-2) and Yale (6-5-3).
Getting top scorers involved in the offense from the beginning of the game will be integral to a Crimson win this Saturday. Freshman Alfred Perez leads the team in scoring with three goals and has been a crucial part of the offense during Harvard’s victories. He was able to score the lone goal in the Crimson’s 1-0 win over the Bulldogs.
Another key factor in this upset bid will be Harvard’s distribution of the ball. The Crimson has only had eight assists this season and only one assist during conference play. The ball will have to move around more in order to combat the Lions defense, which has only let up 10 goals this season.
Columbia (9-4-1, 4-1) has won its last four games and has momentum coming off a 4-0 thrashing of Hofstra this past Tuesday. Having been a consistently strong team in recent history, a victory this Saturday will make it four straight seasons with at least 10 wins for the Lions.
Stopping Columbia’s potent attack will be critical if Harvard wants to prevent its seventh consecutive loss. The Lions have scored 22 goals and 19 assists this season and are averaging 12.3 shots per game. Keeping their top scorers, Dylan Mott and Kynan Rocks, in check, will be a decisive factor in this game.
With a more fluid offensive game plan and stout defense, Harvard has the potential to give its seniors a spectacular senior night that ends with an upset victory. A win against Columbia puts the Crimson in great position to beat Penn in its last game of the season.
The women’s team also looks to give its seniors a farewell treat. The Crimson (6-7-1, 3-2-1) can finish as high as second in the Ivy League with a win over the Lions.
In order to come out of Saturday with a win, Harvard will have to continue to glean valuable contributions from both its veterans and its underclassmen. Senior Leah Mohammadi leads the team with seven goals and 16 points and has been able to perform under pressure during the team’s tight games. In the Crimson’s 3-2 thriller comeback victory over Brown, the California native showed her poise and experience with a goal and an assist in the second half.
In the last two seasons, this game has gone to extra minutes, with last year’s match ending in a scoreless draw. Mohammadi’s veteran leadership will be of utmost importance during these types of clutch circumstances.
Freshmen Sophie Hirst and Taylor Nielsen have also been key offensive contributors for the Crimson with three goals apiece this season. Hirst has already been selected as Ivy League Player of the Week in her young career. In what looks to be a competitive game, having these underclassmen at their best will be critical to a Crimson victory.
The Lions (8-6-1, 4-2) are fresh off back-to-back Ivy League victories and are looking to continue their momentum in Cambridge as they are also looking to secure the second place spot in the Ancient Eight. Considering they only need a draw to finish second, look for Columbia to try to score early and play a defensive game. The Harvard offense needs to attack aggressively so that the Lions cannot simply play keep away the entire game. Furthermore, the Crimson defense will have to step up to stifle the slew of weapons Columbia has on the offensive weapons, as the Lions have had ten players who have scored this season.
Harvard’s women’s side will certainly contend with a hard-fought game this weekend, but with the talent the team has at its disposal, the Crimson can bring home a second-place finish in the Ivy League in what will be the seniors’ final game of their careers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Senior Day, a number of fourth-years shone brightest for Harvard football — but none of them more than quarterback Tom Stewart.
From the first play from scrimmage, it was clear Stewart had something special going. On the opening kickoff, B.J. Watson took the ball 55 yards out of the end zone, only to have his run nullified by a block in the back. Starting at the Crimson seven yard line instead, Stewart was determined to make up for the flag. The senior faked a handoff in the backfield and uncorked a ball that flew nearly 60 yards through the air. Junior wide receiver Jack Cook had his man beat by more than a step — the pass settled into his hands and he sprinted down the sideline into the end zone. One play, 92 yards, seven points.
Following the immediate score, Harvard did not relent in the slightest. The hosts piled on 14 more points in the first quarter and tacked on 17 for good measure in the fourth quarter, ultimately downing Columbia, 52-18. The victory levels the two teams’ overall records at 4-4 and bumps the Crimson (2-3 Ivy) over the Lions (1-4) in the conference standings.
Stewart finished the game with 15 completed passes for a whopping 393 yards. Most impressive, though, were his five passing touchdowns. The mark, achieved late in the fourth quarter, ties the most touchdowns thrown in one game in program history. The feat had been achieved thrice before, twice in 2011 by two different quarterbacks (Collier Winters ’12 and Colton Chapple ’13) and in 1953 by Carroll Lowenstein ’54.
“It’s pretty cool, especially on senior day,” Stewart said. “Couldn’t really script it any better, so I’m on cloud nine right now with that.”
Stewart’s top receiver was a fellow senior — Henry Taylor caught five passes for 105 yards and two scores. Taylor hauled in Stewart’s record-tying toss and also added a touchdown in the second quarter, a leaping grab at the back edge of the end zone.
The latter touchdown occurred on the first play of the drive. Four times on Saturday afternoon, Harvard led off an offensive series with an immediate strike for six. Along with Stewart’s game-opening toss, the others occurred when Stewart connected with Tyler Adams for a 75-yard trip to the end zone and when senior running back Charlie Booker tacked on the game’s final touchdown, getting the Crimson to the century mark.
“That’s the first game in a long time, probably since September, that the game hasn’t gone right down to the wire,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “The bottom line is [I’m] just really happy for our team in general but especially for our seniors, such an amazing group of seniors in so many different ways, especially intangibly. They’re just always so positive. They’re always generating great energy. They’re among our best players.”
The Crimson would not stop at 50. A wild sequence allowed the Crimson to add two points to its last touchdown. Jake McIntyre lined up for an extra point, only to have it blocked. The ball did not cross the line of scrimmage, however, and Cecil Williams nabbed it and dove into the end zone to record an interesting conversion.
Through one half, the rushing attack was not the focal point on a day that saw intermittent rain and violent winds sweeping into Harvard Stadium in the direction of the north end zone. The Crimson had lost 54 net yards on the ground, in part due to a botched snap on a field goal try that resulted in Jake McIntyre downing the ball all the way back at his own 21 yard line.
By the end of the game, however, Harvard finished with 103 ground yards. Sophomore Aaron Shampklin took the lead, tacking on 92 of those 103 and sprinting in for a touchdown in the third. Shampklin was part of the Crimson’s onslaught in the first quarter, albeit as a receiver. Running a wheel route out to the left, the sophomore back caught a perfectly-timed pass without much resistance from the Lions secondary and scooted 74 yards downfield for his second career receiving score.
An extreme wind whipped up about halfway through the third period, briefly slowing both sides’ offensive progress. Hats, yardage markers, pylons, and trash were blowing helter-skelter across the field. In the third quarter alone, the teams combined for five punts. This wind contributed to the run-heavy attack in the final 30 minutes. With 342 passing yards at halftime, Stewart had an opportunity to target the all-time mark of 448 (Chapple, 2011), but the elements curtailed his effort.
Unlike Stewart, Columbia quarterback Ty Lenhart struggled to connect with his wideouts on the deep ball, several times overthrowing receivers downfield. The rookie signal caller finished the contest 20-of-39 with 203 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. Lenhart is the fifth quarterback to play for the Lions this season as the team has dealt with a multitude of key injuries.
“We’ve had to deal with a lot of things — some of it has been medical, some of it has been weather,” Lions coach Al Bagnoli said. “We had a nor’easter last week like everybody else did. Today was about as bad a wind as I could remember, especially mid-third quarter on. But it was a wind for both sides. You’ve got to deal with all that. You’re in the Northeast.”
The second quarter took on a different character than the high-energy first. All of the first three drives of the quarter resulted in turnovers on downs. Two of those favored the Crimson, and the other was McIntyre’s mad dash to down the errant field goal snap. First, Columbia opted to go for it on fourth and two at Harvard’s 20 and came up a yard short on a direct snap run by Kyle Castner. The Lions, with a chance to redeem themselves on their next series, missed out on another three points as kicker Chris Alleyne rattled the uprights.
Columbia crossed the plane for the first time more than halfway through the second frame. To set up the score, the Lions ran a double reverse, but the ball ended up being pitched back to Lenhart. The rookie hit Emerson Kabus, who gained 103 receiving yards in the game, for a gain of 23. Two plays later, Castner catapulted himself over both sets of linemen and shoved the ball over the goal line.
The Crimson broke a short scoring drought as the clock wound down toward halftime. Senior defensive back Wesley Ogsbury picked off Lenhart twice to deliver scoring opportunities for Harvard, the second of which saw Stewart hit Taylor on the back edge of the end zone.
“The second interception I was able to just sit there and bait him into throwing because of the defensive call, but I’ve got to give credit to those receivers,” Ogsbury said. “They’re gritty and they’re tough and that brings out the best in competition. That brought out the best in me.”
After the first pick, Ogsbury handed the ball back to Columbia receiver Kaleb Pitts, who responded by taking a swipe at the Crimson defender. Ogsbury hit the deck hard — a questionable amount of time after the hit — and the teams received offsetting unsportsmanlike conduct penalties.
On a day on which Harvard’s offense was its showcased unit, the defense flew under the radar but performed admirably. In addition to Ogsbury’s picks, captain and defensive back Zach Miller forced a fumble, the team accumulated nine tackles for losses, and linemen Brogan McPartland and Stone Hart teamed up to sack Lenhart three times.
Miller’s forced fumble ended up back in Columbia’s hands, and the Lions proceeded to score their second and final touchdown of the game on a pass from Lenhart to Pitts. The visitors had another scoring chance on their next offensive appearance, but on fourth and 17, McPartland recorded one of his two sacks by bursting around the edge and dragging down Lenhart from behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team plays host to No. 19 Princeton on Saturday night, still in pursuit of its first victory of the campaign. The Crimson (0-2-0, 0-2-0 ECAC) enters the contest at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center following a disappointing 5-3 defeat at the hands of No. 15/12 Quinnipiac on Friday. The Tigers (1-1-0, 1-0-0), meanwhile, put on a characteristically offensive display at Dartmouth, winning handily to a score of 7-1.
With Princeton as the favorite in the imminent Ivy League clash, it will ride the play of star senior forwards Ryan Kuffner and Max Vérroneau as it looks to snap a 10-game losing streak against Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team entered Saturday’s contest against No. 19 Princeton having won the squads’ previous 10 matchups.
The winning streak is no more, but a point streak of 14 games lives on after 65 minutes of hockey ended in the two teams tied at 4-4. The Crimson (0-2-1, 0-1-1 ECAC) has not lost outright to the Tigers (1-1-1, 1-0-1) since 2011.
“Princeton was a good team. They pumped Dartmouth coming in, 7-1, so we knew we had to be ready,” co-captain Michael Floodstrand said. “We got a couple tough bounces there, but we did a good job of weathering it. It sucks to tie, but I think we did a good job of clawing our way back.”
The Ivy League rivals traded goals throughout the first two periods, and Harvard entered the third frame trailing by a goal, still in search of its first notch in the win column in 2018-2019.
“It’s always a dagger going into the third when you’re chasing, especially in this league [ECAC] when teams can really shut it down,” Floodstrand said. “The mentality was, keep going. We were outshooting them, we knew that we were kind of outplaying them five-on-five.”
Only two minutes had expired in the final stanza when freshman Jack Rathbone threw a puck toward Princeton goaltender Ryan Ferland. With multiple Crimson skaters jamming at Ferland’s pads, the puck eventually popped out to the left of the crease where freshman Casey Dornbach hammered it home, tying the game at four.
After a staggering five powerplay goals against Dartmouth last week, Harvard’s man-up unit was held off the scoresheet in Friday’s 5-3 loss to Quinnipiac. In the second period on Saturday, the Crimson once again produced on the man-advantage, as blue-liners Adam Fox and Reilly Walsh reminded fans, coaches, and players alike how dangerous they are in the offensive zone.
Fox began the sequence, receiving the puck at the middle point and toe-dragging his way around a helpless defender. With all eyes on the junior’s dazzling hands, Fox dished a backhand pass to an open Dornbach, who found Walsh on a low-to-high pass through traffic. The sophomore ripped a shot that skimmed freshman Jack Drury on its way to the back of the net.
Despite the successful Crimson powerplay opportunity, a Princeton shorthanded goal from junior defenseman Derek Topatigh netted out the Drury score mere minutes later.
Overall, the Tigers ran away with the special teams battle, as alternate captain Ryan Kuffner potted his second man-up goal of the night — an in-close redirect off the heel of his stick blade, eerily similar to his first — after Topatigh’s tying strike.
“We’re still searching for the understanding of how not to beat ourselves,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We gave up a goal on our powerplay and we gave up two shorthanded goals, but I give our guys credit for battling through that.”
For the Crimson, the trend of untimely goals against — particularly at the beginning of periods — continued on Saturday night. Less than four minutes into the tilt, Princeton senior Max Véronneau gained possession of the puck off a center-ice faceoff. The alternate captain ripped a shot along the ice and beat senior net-minder Michael Lackey five-hole.
“The first [Princeton] goal, I don’t know if that’s a great scoring chance,” coach Donato said. “I think we probably want that back from a goaltending standpoint.”
Véronneau, always an offensive threat, finished with four points (1–3—4) on the evening.
Unlike Friday’s contest, in which Harvard found itself in a multi-goal hole early on, the home team was able to notch the score less than two minutes after the Tigers tally, tilting the ice back to neutral.
Sophomore Jack Badini took the puck around the back of the cage before dishing to Rathbone at the point. The rookie fired a one-timer through traffic and found twine.
Not only did the Crimson even the ledger, but two minutes later it seized control of the game thanks to a hard drive to the net from sophomore forward Henry Bowlby. Ultimately, the opening period finished tied at two goals after Kuffner struck on the power play, but importantly, coach Donato’s group showed resiliency after allowing an early goal.
“We stressed — we were hoping — that [an early goal against] wouldn’t happen,” Dornbach said. “That’s something we have to work on. It always makes it tough when you’re chasing the game like that. Hopefully we can start getting some first goals, but I thought the guys worked hard [after conceding the first goal].”
Saturday night saw Lackey regain his spot between the pipes after coach Donato, dissatisfied by Lackey’s seven goals allowed last week, gave the nod to junior Cameron Gornet on Friday. While his numbers (4 GA, .826 SV%) may not jump off the page, the senior backstop kept his team in the game and showed bursts of promising net-minding.
“I thought Michael battled,” coach Donato started. “I think much like our team’s game, it looked better but there’s still room for improvement and still areas we can be better. But I liked the fact that he came out and was really battling…. When all is said and done, I think he’s got a better game inside of him, and I think he would tell you that.”
Harvard’s goaltending situation will continue to develop as the season progresses, with the starting role very much still up for grabs while the goals against remain abundant.
Two freshmen, Drury (1–1—2 tonight) and Dornbach (1–2—3), netted their first career goals on Saturday night. Another rookie, Rathbone (1–2—3), added to his productive weekend with a strike of his own. In total, freshmen accounted for eight of the Crimson’s 12 points on the scoresheet and three of the team’s four tallies.
Prior to the tilt, coach Donato jumbled the lines quite significantly but left the pairing of Bowlby, Drury, and Dornbach from Friday night intact. The early chemistry starting to form between the trio will be key in establishing Harvard’s ideal line combinations moving forward.
“It’s just kind of part of the game and part of our team,” Floodstrand said. “The lines kind of shifted up a little bit, which is great…. It’s always super helpful to kind of get those changes and spark a little bit of excitement.”
