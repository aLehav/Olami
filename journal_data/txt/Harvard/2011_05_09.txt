After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student researchers at MIT will soon have acoustic sound systems and noise-canceling headphones to thank for funding their endeavors. On April 29, Amar Bose, chairman of the Bose Corporation, announced that he had donated the majority of stock in his audio products company to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bose earned his bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, and Ph.D. from MIT and served on its faculty from 1956—eight years before he founded the Bose Corporation—until 2001. The university is now the majority owner of the Bose Corporation, but its shares are nonvoting, and Bose remains the chairman of the company. Dividends will be used to “sustain and advance MIT’s education and research mission.” Bose’s decision to confer majority ownership to his alma mater reflects the long history of financial interdependence shared by private universities and corporations. As such, Bose’s contribution sets a precedent of how corporate leaders can exert a positive influence over the universities they benefit.
Major corporate investments should reflect a genuine commitment to the intellectual goals of the academic initiative being funded. Larry Ellison, CEO of enterprise software giant Oracle Corporation and the fifth richest person worldwide, made headlines in 2006 when he reneged on a promise to donate $115 million to Harvard. The gift, which would have been the largest donation from a single individual in the University’s history, was intended to fund the establishment of a Harvard-affiliated global health foundation. Ellison’s change of heart came after Larry Summers stepped down as the University’s president. “It was really Larry Summers' brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered," an Oracle spokesperson told CBS News. The Oracle case demonstrates the volatility of planned corporate investments based merely on personal relationships between CEOs and university administrators. In retrospect, Ellison’s business focus on enterprise technology seems to have had little connection to the global health initiative he had planned to fund at Harvard. In contrast, the Bose Corporation’s emphasis on technology development aligns with its plans to sponsor MIT research.
If corporate leaders plan to devote a portion of their company’s profit to an academic institution, the university or project receiving funding should be of personal significance to them. Notably, Harvard produces more CEOs than any other university in the country, and its endowment—funded in large part by alumni donations—gives Harvard a reputation as one of the world’s wealthiest institutions. As demonstrated by Bose, alumni and faculty enjoy an in-depth understanding of a university’s goals and, in result, how best to fund them. Bose’s choice to donate shares to MIT, rather than a one-time monetary gift, ensures sustained research funding for long-term projects. Moreover, Bose can exercise the influence of his substantial relationship with MIT to make certain that his company’s dividends are rightfully utilized to fund research, holding the university accountable.
Finally, corporate-university partnerships must be of mutual, but fair, benefit. Corporate investments are too often the harbingers of skewed research leading to disproportionate corporate gain. Universities, in need of research funding due to federal budget cuts, accept corporate sponsorship, but the private funding is sometimes accompanied by a dominating corporate presence that dictates the nature of university research, policy or action. For a prime example, look to recent controversy over pharmaceutical investment in top medical schools, which prompted Harvard Medical School to enact policies to limit pharmaceutical sponsors’ marketing presence at its continuing medical education conferences, among other accountability measures, earlier this year. The Bose case illustrates how a company can benefit without compromising the goals of its benefactor university. By transferring majority ownership to MIT, the chairman of Bose may be guarding his original vision for the company against competing interests, making it difficult for the Bose Corporation to go public in the future and solidifying its emphasis on research, while possibly taking advantage of gray areas in tax codes. Despite these corporate benefits, the details of the share transfer that have been disclosed thus far exhibit little potential for compromising MIT’s research or academic aims.
In fiscal year 2010, corporate donations accounted for 17 percent of the approximately $600 million donated to Harvard. Fostering positive ties like that of Bose and MIT, this well-endowed university should carefully review the motives of proposed corporate investments in order to maintain the integrity of its Wall Street alliances.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About two weeks ago, Dean of Harvard College Evelynn M. Hammonds announced that the College would hire a full-time director of BGLTQ student life in addition to expanding existing BGLTQ resources on campus.
The decision came after an extensive review of the BGLTQ experience at Harvard, and we applaud Dean Hammonds for taking this long overdue step and hiring a director to oversee the diverse BGLTQ resources on campus. This new position promises to promote greater visibility and awareness of Harvard’s BGLTQ community and to cement the College’s commitment to these issues—both essential steps for creating an accepting environment on Harvard’s campus. Peer institutions like Stanford and Princeton, which both have full-time BGLTQ directors, have made tremendous progress organizing their resources, and we hope Harvard will be able to do the same.
At present, the BGLTQ resources and initiatives on campus are largely decentralized, lacking the coordination needed to bring a diverse community together. Despite the presence of eight different BGLTQ organizations on campus, almost three-quarters of BGLTQ-identified students did not report being active in such a group. However, close to half of the undergraduates consulted strongly believed that Harvard students would benefit from more BGLTQ-related events. This obvious discrepancy represents a significant potential for increased outreach and community building among BGLTQ students. Having a central figure to advise and coordinate student initiatives would facilitate this effort and lend a public face to many of these endeavors.
The College’s decision to appoint a public figure to direct BGLTQ student life is both an important symbolic gesture and course of action. Having a vocal figure to stand behind the BGLTQ community is a necessary step toward increasing the visibility of these issues on campus and providing students with a strong role model. In addition, by serving as a liaison between the administration and the students, a BGLTQ director can smooth communication issues and hasten progress on student initiatives.
Ideally however, some of the new director’s resources and efforts should extend beyond the BGLTQ community and serve to raise awareness among Harvard’s heterosexual student body. Recent tragedies such as the suicide of Rutgers student Tyler Clementi show that tremendous progress remains to be made in terms of bringing an understanding of these issues to the heterosexual community. In the student life survey, close to a third of BGLTQ students stated that they had avoided participating in an event or organization due to “a potential for heterosexist bias, harassment, and/or discrimination.” Such a disheartening fact indicates the importance of educating the heterosexual population on BGLTQ issues and creating an atmosphere that is not only tolerant but welcoming of gender diversity, even at the seemingly progressive Harvard.
The history of Harvard’s BGLTQ community has undoubtedly been filled with both tremendous challenges and successes. It is important to acknowledge that many of these efforts were led by small groups of outspoken individuals, such as the founders of the Harvard-Radcliffe Gay Students Association, one of the earliest organizations to address BGLTQ issues in 1971. While the College’s decision to appoint a public BGLTQ figure is an important validation of support for the BGLTQ movement, a great deal of credit should be given to the students, alumnae, and faculty members whose autonomous efforts have made these changes possible.
The decision to hire a BGLTQ director represents a socially responsible and moral action on the part of the College. As an institution that prides itself on welcoming diversity among its students, Harvard has an obligation to live up to this image and do what it can to foster inclusivity on its campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is not the bastion of absolute acceptance that I had once hoped it would be.
My experiences have reshaped my conception of the College from one of impregnable safety to one marred by insidious homophobia.
It was Friday night and my friend and I were playing Texas Hold’em in the Cabot common room. Two other juniors with whom we had played in the past had joined us, and we were casually discussing matters of no particular importance, focusing more on the cards than on the small talk. An hour and a half into the game, a new student joins us who strikes me as an amiable guy. It must have been hand #150. Four players in the pot, and the flop comes up: Queen, 3, 10. The new player bets aggressively. Two of us fold, and two remain in the hand. Following no continuation bets, the remaining two cards are a Jack and then a 5. The players reveal their hands. The new student wins with a pair of 3’s.
“Damn, I folded a Queen on the flop!” laments one of the senior members of our troupe.
“What a faggot move!” scolds the new player. My friend and I exchange uncomfortable glances—we astonishingly yet tacitly acknowledge to each other what had just happened. In case we hadn’t heard him the first time, he repeats, “You’re a real faggot for doing that.” My friend and I were appalled at his bigotry-laden antagonism—I couldn’t let his insensibility go unacknowledged. After embarrassingly beating him one-on-one in the very next hand with trip 10’s, I finally affirmed, “You probably shouldn’t have called him that.” He was taken aback and recanted, “Oh, I’m sorry if someone here is gay.” That was his worst bluff of the night.
At Harvard, we pride ourselves on being an institution that supports openness and diversity. As with the former ban on ROTC involvement on campus, our administration contends that discrimination or prejudice against any individual on the basis sexual orientation is intolerable and will be met with harsh repercussion. Bolstering this sentiment, student groups vigorously mobilize against instances of  LGBT exclusion in Cambridge and fight actively against models of hatred. “LGBTQ Safe Space” signs adorn the doors of our proctors, professors, and fellow students. The residential community welcomes freshmen with a variety of residential specialty proctors whose purpose is to provide support for LGBT students. In short, we are the paragon of acceptance—at least in theory.
However, this dogma of universal tolerance on campus is not one shared by all in our community. The slur “faggot”—a term that encapsulates a vicious and ongoing history spewed with violence, oppression, and denigration against the LGBT population—has no place at Harvard. A student body that promotes the respect and acceptance of thy fellow classmates should never let such a word be used so flippantly. If everyone at Harvard were as educated and committed to diversity as we would hope, all students would understand the gravity of such a term. With a troubling national trend of gay suicides and bullying, all students of Harvard should be conscious of our obligation to reject anti-gay slurs. Unfortunately, however, my witness of homophobia extends beyond a single poker game.
Several months ago, as a late night party was raging in the upper floors of Pforzheimer House, a gay male friend and I were waiting for the Quad shuttle from Currier. Suddenly, a partygoer stuck his head from the window and yelled down at us: “Faggots!” in a menacing voice so loud that it was heard throughout the quadrangle. We weren’t kissing, holding hands, or even standing next to each other, but this individual chose to affirm his deep-seated fear of queerness by attempting to torment two fellow students.
It is deeply unsettling to conceive that a student at the hallowed halls of Harvard would cowardly accost others under the pretense of their homosexuality. Admittedly, if this had occurred at my public middle school in Queens, New York, I would not have been even mildly surprised. “Faggot” was a word that was commonplace among these immature students. When witnessing such puerile hatred at a “progressive” institution such at Harvard, however, it forces me to question the reality of our professed universal tolerance. It is disconcerting to consider that some individuals have remained regressed in a juvenile state wherein phrases such as “faggot” and “that’s so gay” are commonplace in their language. Any individual who viciously demeans two others with no other motive than belligerent prejudice does not deserve to call himself a “Harvard man.”
Students find solace and self-esteem in knowing that U.S. News consistently ranks Harvard as the “best” college in the United States; we are widely recognized as the most prestigious American institute of higher education. However, in the 2010 Newsweek ranking of “Best Gay-Friendly Schools,” Harvard failed to even make the Top 25, being bested by our Ivy League peers at UPenn, Princeton, Columbia, Brown, and Cornell. There are many factors that determine a university’s greatness, and the commitment of the student body to the acceptance of their peers should be our concern.
My experiences do not suggest, by any measure, that all of our students hold the same menacing anxieties as those whom I have encountered. However, no student should ever be complicit in homophobia on our campus. It is our duty to speak out against every form of bigotry that we witness—doing so is part of our moral obligation as Harvard students and human beings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You know you've made it big as a community when you've got your own month.
Blacks have February, women have March, and queers have Gaypril. I can guarantee that you saw members of the gay community—that is, mainly the gay male community and only a couple of queer women—out and about celebrating gay pride by means of a day of silence to raise awareness about the prevalence of homophobia, holding seminars deeper exploring sexuality, and/or having parties with rainbow shots.
 
But, where, might you ask, were all the ladies? That is what I would love to know.
 
This is a question that is consistently asked by a lot of different folk who live on, work at, and visit campus. I have been out as a lesbian all my four years (if you didn't know, now you do), and I am the current co-chair of Girlspot, Harvard's organization for queer women and allies. When meeting up with newborn dykes to help guide them and welcome them into the community, the conversation always leads to the question “are there even lesbians at Harvard?”
 
If you also find yourself wondering this, I will tell you: spread out. There are the rugby lesbians (but not all rugby players are lesbians), the political activist lesbians, the not-associated-with-anything-but-whatever lesbians, lesbians that only hang out with lesbians off campus, hipster lesbians (but not all hipsters are lesbians), lesbians that claim labels don't exist (and probably hate this list of labels), and lone wolf lesbians that fly solo. At the beginning of this year, I employed my creeping skills and compiled an email list of just 45 women on campus whom I knew were queer. Compared to the U.S. average of 3.5 percent, out of the 6,400 undergrads, I would assume that only one percent of the population plays for my team. Keeping all this in mind, if we are spread out among the other 99 percent of the Harvard population, we are practically invisible.
 
Fortunately, I am 22 and am able to go out to nightclubs on the weekends to dance in a sea of women—glorious! It is very difficult and upsetting to go from a scene that is filled with everything I could ever desire to a scene filled with sweaty dudes hitting on anything that has tits and an ass and breathes. The options end up being: room parties, final clubs, or a movie in the dorm—in any case, trapped in the heteronormative (and, from that structure, homonormative) walls of Harvard that seem unapproachable and unfriendly from the outside.
 
My main objective with the random acts of gayness is to educate. Basing most of my strategy on the methodology used in “Pay it Forward,” I hope that the ladies across campus will start to share our knowledge. Examples of things you can do: Clarify what actually is lesbian sex (scissoring was so South Park); swap pick up lines with a straight dude; always be a gentlewoman and walk a girl to class, hold doors for her, treat her like a princess (gender norms were made to be reappropriated anyway); befriend a straight chick and teach her how she should respect her body; teach the males how to cherish her body; finally, just lez out in public at any opportunity. Straight people do it all the time.
 
There is always the choice to leave things the way they are—stay practically invisible. And I understand that sometimes, we remain this way because it seems easier to hide from alienation or discrimination, though I often wonder how remaining hidden probably perpetuates our own marginalization. If we continue to be unable to find each other, we will be missing out on a great opportunity. You could claim that it is a bit of “normalcy” that I am seeking within the queer women's community here at Harvard.
Realizing that life after Harvard can be a social scene in which one need hardly ever associate with straights again (i.e., move to New York or San Francisco or London, etc. to live within the respective communities in those places), by valuing the relationships and power of our Harvard network while still at Harvard, we bring real world realness to a life of being gay. Gays count on gays.
There is also, of course, the idea of social contact theory at work here: People are less likely to discriminate and stereotype different groups of people when they have personally interacted with them on an equal level. If we queer women of Harvard decide we want to enhance the awareness and social contact with other groups, I anticipate that our visibility and unity as a group on campus will strengthen and will be a positive asset for the queer community at-large. This will for sure be a hard task. Yet, if all else fails, we will have at least made Harvard that much gayer and will have helped perpetuate the gay agenda, which totally exists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Materials science professor Joanna Aizenberg has been appointed the new director of the interdisciplinary Kavli Institute for Bionanoscience and Technology, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences announced last Tuesday.
Aizenberg, who has been on leave this year, will replace former director David A. Weitz, a professor of physics, on July 1.
“Being named a director of this center is really a big honor,” said Aizenberg, adding that her goals are to increase the visibility of the institution and support greater interdisciplinary discussion and “high-risk” research on campus.
“[There are] many things happening at the University, [but] not everything is effectively reaching all parts,” she said.
Aizenberg said that she plans to broaden the scope of the Institute’s impact—and its audience—by introducing a Kavli Distinguished Lecture Series, which will bring top scientists at the bio-nano research interface to speak at Harvard.
She also plans to implement an Institute advisory board that will help make major Institute decisions.
Aizenberg said she hopes to maintain the scientific focus established by Weitz, but also more widely publicize the strength of the Kavli Institute as a “forum for interaction.”
This endeavor has already been embraced by the Institute through its weekly Kavli Koffee Hours, during which anyone may come and present a scientific problem that is not yet understood. The ensuing discussions will often yield solutions—or plant the ideas for future research and collaboration, according to Weitz.
Past projects that have been funded by the Institute include studies on the shapes of the beaks of different birds and the structures of petals and flowers at the nanoscale level.
“Research really depends, maybe fortunately, maybe unfortunately, on the funding,” Aizenberg said. “Most interesting ideas, high risk ideas, that may not be easy to implement, are very difficult to support,”
“I think what the Kavli Institute can bring—and it certainly does already—is the ability to feed exactly these topics,” she said.
Fellow faculty affiliates at the Institute echoed excitement at Aizenberg’s appointment.
“[Aizenberg’s] research really personifies the point of the Kavli Institute—namely she works at the edge of technology and biology to make very creative devices,” said Applied Mathematics professor Michael P. Brenner.
She holds joint professorship appointments in the Chemistry department, SEAS, and the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and will serve as co-director with chemistry Professor George M. Whitesides.
“She’s a fantastic scientist [and] brilliant innovator,” Weitz said. “People at Kavli love her—she’ll be a great director.”

Harvard plans to buy back $300 million of bonds that it sold during the financial crisis, since a reduction in debt would allow the University more flexibility to make new investments, according to Bloomberg.
Harvard, which sold a total of $2.5 billion in bonds in 2008 at the height of the credit crisis, notified investors last month that the University will redeem part of its debt on June 2, according to Bloomberg.
The securities were rated AAA—the highest possible rating—and were set to mature in January 2014 with an annual interest rate of 5 percent.
The “redemption price”—the price at which the bonds can be redeemed—has not yet been set.
Now, Harvard is one of several universities that have begun to buy back debt that was sold during the credit crisis. During the worst of the financial crisis, Harvard sold $1.5 billion in taxable bonds and $1 billion of tax-exempt debt to bolster its cash holdings
Last week, Duke University bought back $500 million, but was required to pay almost a 15 percent premium to redeem $250 million of its bonds that were set to mature in April 2019. Duke also had to pay a 7.9 percent premium for the remainder, which was to mature in April 2014.
Stanford, which borrowed $1 billion in April 2009, announced in January that in light of increased financial stability it will reduce its “liquidity fund” from $800 million to $400 million over the coming months. The $400 million drawn from the liquidity fund will be use to fund capital projects and to refinance higher-cost debt, according to Stanford’s chief financial officer.
This trend indicates that universities are beginning to feel more confident in their financial positions and levels of liquidity.
During the recession, many universities, including six Ivy league schools, sold a combined $7.2 billion of taxable bonds from December 2008 to November 2009 as their endowments suffered serious blows, according to Bloomberg.
Harvard’s endowment weathered heavy losses during the financial crisis beginning in 2008, adding up to a 30 percent dip in the endowment’s value.
Recently Harvard has begun to recover, posting an 11 percent gain in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2010, which brought the endowment’s value to $27.4 billion.
Harvard manages a portion of its endowment directly and contracts with outside money managers for the remainder.
This past year, Harvard University added to its directly held U.S. traded securities—contributing to a 7-percent increase in the value of those assets to $1.54 billion.
The University made sizable new investments in its already large emerging markets portfolio, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing report in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part II of this series appeared May 11. Part III appeared May 13.)
Jack K., a third year student at Harvard Law School, dreams of serving in the military again.
One week each fall, members of the Judge Advocate General’s Corps visit Harvard Law School to recruit its next crop of military lawyers. For Jack, it’s one of the most difficult weeks of the year.
Despite his past military service, Jack is not eligible for JAG because he is a trans man. Since his honorable discharge in 2007, Jack, who insisted on his last name not being included in this story to prevent potential workplace discrimination, has undergone  sex-change surgery, having had top surgery to remove his breasts.
The military considers those with gender identity disorder, the medical diagnosis associated with transgender persons, and those who have physically transitioned unfit for service. Sidelined by military medical policy, he must watch while his peers compete for his career of choice.
LGBTQ-identified individuals have long been excluded from openly serving in the American military, but with the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” last fall, gays, lesbians, and bisexuals are now permitted to serve without the risk of being discharged on the basis of their sexual orientation.
Despite this landmark advance in gay rights, transgender men and women like Jack are still ineligible for military service as their exclusion is based on the Department of Defense’s medical policy. Meanwhile at Harvard, the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” has brought about the return of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, but the University has been largely deaf to arguments that while the military continues to prevent trans-identified men and women, the program’s presence on campus violates its non-discrimination policy.
Some defenders of the University’s decision say that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military represents a historic step forward that warrants Harvard’s recognition, justifying the exclusion of what is seen as a small minority. Jack is a member of that minority, and until military policy changes, his dreams of serving in the military are likely to remain deferred.
TRANSITION
Jack was rushing toward the ground, the wind howling around him. Like many times before, he had just hurled himself from an airplane. But this time he was descending right above his fellow paratrooper’s parachute. The only thing between Jack and the ground rushing up at him was the parachute of the trooper below him.
“I was coming down on their parachute, which is not good because their parachute would be taking all the air from mine and I would have to pull my reserve,” Jack says. “But I had been trained what to do. We’re taught to run on and off the other person’s parachute to move away, so I ran on their chute.”
Jack, who trained as a medic and attended airborne school at Fort Benning in Georgia, says joining the military was a lifelong dream. After graduating from the University of Nebraska in 2006, Jack considered entering the job market or pursuing another degree, but chose to enlist in the Army.
“I got trained to jump out of airplanes. It was very fun.” Jack says, smiling to himself. His tone is regretful and nostalgic. Sitting in the student center at the Law School, Jack wears a blue pin-striped button down, jeans, and loafers. His short hair is spiked up in the front, pushing his bangs off his lightly freckled forehead. His eyes are soft and keen. His manner is easy. Since childhood, Jack has had a keen interest in the military.
“When I was growing up I was really into playing war games, playing soldier,” Jack says. “I remember being eight years old and checking out books from the library about the military.”
As a child, he was particularly fascinated by aviation.
“I had always wanted to fly helicopters,” Jack adds. “Plus, combat pilots were one of the few sort of combat-oriented jobs that were open to women.”
At this time, Jack had not yet transitioned and identified as a lesbian woman.
He served in the military until he was discharged in 2007 under the guidelines of the recently repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” He credits his honorable discharge to his good relationship with his captain.
“It was a false choice—serving in the military but hiding your sexuality,” Jack says, his frustration evident. “When you’re in the Army you’re taught core values—two of those are honesty and integrity. You can’t live that and lie about important parts of your life, such as who your partner is.”
As he closeted himself from his unit, Jack says he struggled with lying to his fellow soldiers. His lifelong dream of serving in the military clashed with feelings of guilt that stemmed from lying about his sexual orientation.
“[DADT] forced you to lie to your friends about what you did on the weekend and who you’re going home to visit and who you’re talking to on the phone. You have to lie to your unit, the people you’re close with, the people who you’re supposed to go to war with, the people who are putting their lives in your hands and your life in theirs. It was impossible to adhere to those values and adhere to ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’”
If Jack had not transitioned he would eligible to join the military today, but he says he does not regret his decision.
“At the time I transitioned, people were pretty pessimistic about the repeal of DADT,” he says. “But I don’t regret it now. There’s still room for the military to make changes and allow myself and other trans people to serve.”
Because the military prohibits those older than 42 from enlisting, the clock is ticking on Jack’s military career.
“My surgery was a matter of being comfortable in my body. The military just needs to hurry up and make this change—because I’m going to be 30 in a few years!”
After his discharge, Jack enrolled in law school at the University of San Diego but transferred to Harvard Law in 2009 after completing his first year.
Jack began his transition upon transferring to the Law School and has since received hormone treatment and top surgery.
Though Jack, who has medically transitioned but has not been diagnosed with gender identity disorder, says he would love to rejoin the military, the military still excludes him despite the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” last November.
Jack says that this physical transition has in no way affected his ability to serve.
“Whether I have an Adam’s Apple or not doesn’t affect the way I serve,” Jack says. “I’d be just as good a soldier today as I was a few years ago.”
“If anything my transition has enhanced [my ability to serve]. I can do more push-ups and run faster,” he adds.
RECOGNITION
In the muddy rain-soaked patch of grass between Lamont and Loeb House, Jack stood with his black Labrador and 30 or so other trans rights activists to protest the ceremony honoring the University’s recognition of NROTC.
With each opening of the exterior door in a gilded room in Loeb House, their cries of “Put down your pen!” and “Drew Faust, it’s not too late! Harvard can’t discriminate” trickled in.
The room was filled with military brass who had assembled to watch University President Drew G. Faust sign an agreement that officially recognized the Naval Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, a historic break from the University’s previously tense relationship with the military.
The University’s unwillingness to recognize the program had been based on the objection that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” had violated the University’s non-discrimination policy. Faust had pledged earlier that Harvard would recognize the program following the policy’s repeal, so when Congress moved to allow gays and lesbians to openly serve, Faust followed through on that promise and signed the agreement with the Navy.
“I feel this is an extremely important moment to recognize that “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” has been the hook for our distance from ROTC for two decades now and that the very important repeal of that law puts us in a situation where we want to respond with the appropriate enactment of what we’d said we’d do,” Faust said after signing the agreement.
But for the trans rights activists protesting outside Loeb House, because the military continues to exclude trans-identified men and women it still violates the University’s non-discrimination policy despite the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.”
“It was such an exciting moment for Harvard,” Jack says. “But it was just so marginalizing to stand outside Loeb House. It was incredibly difficult as a vet to stand by the sidelines and watch service members in uniform and ROTC cadets take pride in that moment.”
“Being there on the sidelines, you realize that not only does this institution [the military] exclude you, but that this school that has a non-discrimination policy that’s supposed to protect you is too.”
University officials have said that the decision to recognize ROTC stemmed from the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and have put concerned activists in touch with the military to discuss the military’s medical policy.
“I know there are many students who feel that ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’s repeal doesn’t go far enough. My senior staff has met with them and I am listening to their concerns and I hope I can continue dialogue with them and enhance dialogue between them and people in the armed services,” Faust said to a group of reporters after the ceremony. “In fact, we have arranged for an individual in the Navy to receive comments from them and to interact with them and to talk to some of the members of the trans community in hopes of furthering that dialogue by continuing to address this issue.”
Jack, Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ‘11, and Jia Hui Lee ’12, a student leader on the Trans Task Force, met with administrators from Faust’s office a few days prior to the ceremony. They say they felt brushed aside by the University and were alarmed by how quickly the University recognized ROTC after meeting with campus trans activists.
But several faculty members at the ceremony recognized the protesters’ concerns and said that they intend to work toward reconciling this issue.
“I view them sympathetically. This is a work in progress, but recognizing ROTC is a very important step nonetheless,” said Harvard Divinity School Professor Diana L. Eck, a Lowell House Master who has served on the BLGTQ Task Force, at the signing ceremony.
The recognition of ROTC represents a significant rapprochement between Harvard and the military and comes against the background of one of the most significant advances in civil rights in recent years. But like improvements in civil rights in the past, allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military has been called only a partial victory as trans-identified individuals continue to be excluded from the armed forces.
With a degree on the horizon from the Law School, Jack says that he would like to join the military’s legal division. Instead, he will be taking a corporate law job in San Francisco.
“On the ROTC issue, I want to express how difficult it is to want to serve, be denied the opportunity, and have the institution you attend sanction that discrimination,” Jack writes in an email. “It is an incredibly marginalizing experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Monitor Group said on Friday that elements of work it conducted for Muammar Gaddafi’s Libyan regime from 2006 through 2008—with support from some members of the Harvard faculty—should have been identified as lobbyist activity according to federal policy, leading one involved Harvard professor to say he was misled.
Monitor, a consulting firm co-founded by Harvard professors in 1983, said in a statement that it would retroactively register its work under the Foreign Agents Registration Act after the internally-hired law firm Covington & Burling concluded that some of the consulting group’s work in Libya violated the 1938 legislation.
The Libyan government paid the group $250,000 per month to identify opportunities for economic and political reform. The firm’s work also included a program that brought influential “thought leaders”—including two prominent Harvard professors—to the nation, according to The Boston Globe.
Harvard Kennedy School Professor Robert D. Putnam, who partook in the Monitor program, told The Globe that he had not known of a lobbying agenda.
“If I had known that a primary purpose of the visit to Libya was to influence public opinion in the United States, I would not have gone,” he said in an interview with The Globe.
Other professors, including former Harvard Kennedy School Dean Joseph S. Nye Jr., said they did not feel misled, according to The Globe.
According to FARA, if any organization engages in political activities for or in the interests of a foreign power or acts in a public relations role for a representative of the power, that firm must register with the U.S. Department of Justice.
Although Monitor said in a leaked 2009 report to the Libyan government that it “is not a lobbying organization,” the Covington & Burling report found that Monitor’s invovlement in Libya constitutes a breach of FARA policies. The consulting firm is moving to register its work with the U.S. Department of Justice.
“We made some mistakes,” Monitor’s Managing Partner Stephen M. Jennings said in the statement. “While we stand by the majority of our work in and for that country, we have been resolute in our determination to find the facts, remedy errors, and ensure that we learn from them.”
Computer Science Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 first raised concerns with Harvard’s connection with Monitor’s activity in Libya at an April 5 meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Lewis called for the University to publicly condemn University Professor Michael E. Porter, a co-founder of the firm, for “taking money” to write a report for Libya that said that Gaddafi’s government is a “popular” and “direct” democracy.
“To put it simply, a tyrant wanted a crimson-tinged report that he was running a democracy,” Lewis said at the meeting, encouraging University President Drew G. Faust to publicly censure Porter. “Shouldn’t Harvard acknowledge its embarrassment, and might you remind us that when we parlay our status as Harvard professors for personal profit, we can hurt both the University and all of its members?”
Faust responded that her responsibilities as University president extend to promoting freedom of speech—and not serving as “public scolder-in-chief.”
In an email to The Crimson yesterday, Lewis repeated his call for University action given the recent developments.
“It does seem to me that with all the Harvard connections that are in these news stories about Monitor, it’s time for the University to say something about it,” Lewis wrote. “It’s awkward and embarrassing for the University to act as though it hadn’t noticed or doesn’t care.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
(Part I of this series appeared May 6.)
At Harvard, the cry for social space is nothing new. In fact, the effort to create a building to unify all of Harvard’s disparate populations has been going on for over a century.
In an 1899 speech, Major Henry Lee Higginson, class of 1855, chastised “the old clubs, with their small membership and high expenses.” In response to what he saw as the increasingly fractured student body, Higginson donated $150,000 for the creation of the “Harvard Union,” intended to serve as a space to unify undergraduates.
As former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 recently put it, the Union was “the club for kids who didn’t have clubs.”
But even before the Harvard Union turned into the Barker Center in the late ’90s, students said that the Student Union did not sufficiently meet undergraduate needs for social space on campus.
For decades, the calls for more social space and possibly a student center have continued.
Over the years, the push and pull between students and administrators on the issue of social space has been a continual feature of student life at Harvard.
The patterns of the debate are clear. Over time, as student dissatisfaction with the current situation manifests in requests for a central student center, the administration responds with the creation of smaller spaces, an effort to find piecemeal solutions to a problem that never seems to go away.
THE SPACE CRUNCH
Despite Higginson’s lofty goals for the creation of a centralized space to bring together undergraduates, over the past century, the changing nature of the student body and the spaces in which they lived, studied, and socialized have fueled persistent complaints about Harvard’s social life.
The end of Higginson’s dream came early, as the creation of the House system in the 1930s transformed the Union into the Freshman Union, a more institutionalized dining hall and social space for freshmen.
“The Union is dead between meals,” Phillip J. Parsons, then-director of planning in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, told The Crimson in 1992.
Parsons was a significant player in one of the major transitions of undergraduate space in the past century. The University had just finalized its plans to convert the Union into a hub for the humanities—now known as the Barker Center—and move the freshman dining hall to Memorial Hall. A $7 million gift from Katherine B. Loker for the creation of undergraduate space in the basement of Memorial Hall seemed to provide an answer to the problem of social space.
But the pool tables and fast food in Loker Commons did not provide a lasting solution for students and the student groups to which they belonged.
“It was basically an uncomfortable study space,” former Undergraduate Council Vice President Samuel C. Cohen ’00 says. “While I was there, it never quite worked.”
Despite the projects of the last decade designed to increase available social space—including the opening of Lamont Café and the Cambridge Queen’s Head pub in the basement of Memorial Hall—these complaints are familiar to current Harvard students.
“If you go down to the Greenhouse Café in the Science Center, every table is taken up by students with their laptops,” former Dean of the College Benedict H. Gross ’71 says. “I still think it’s a pretty bad situation.”
THE STUDENT CENTER CAMPAIGN
For many Harvard students, an all-encompassing student center has been seen as the ultimate solution to the space problem. As a 1988 Crimson editorial succinctly put it, “students at Harvard have been asking for a Student Center since the end of World War II.”
Even while the Freshman Union was a functioning space for students in the Yard, the desire for more space pushed student leaders to petition for a student center.
As early as 1958, a different social need—interaction between Harvard men and Radcliffe women—pushed students to ask for a student center. In 1964, the two student governments asked the University to create an undergraduate student center in Lehman Hall—now home to a center for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences contemplated the transition from the Freshman Union to the Barker Center in the late 1980s, student leaders feared that the change would hurt student life.
With the loss of meeting rooms in the Union and some group spaces already in the basement of Memorial Hall, campus leaders worried about the future of undergraduate space in the Yard, leading to the creation of the group Students Concerned for a Student Center.
“I remember noticing the plans for renovation of the basement of Mem Hall and that it involved elimination of a lot of space,” Jeffrey A. Camp ’89, who was a co-chair of SCSC, recalls. “The undergraduates’ interests didn’t feel like they were strongly emphasized.”
Ten years later in the late 90s, Camp’s efforts were renewed by the Undergraduate Council.
In a report to the College community, the Council’s Student Center Working Group outlined their vision for the center—a building with student group offices, meeting rooms, performing arts venues, and a mall area with informal social spaces. The UC even allocated $25,000 in 1999 toward the creation of a student center as a symbolic gift, meant to show the administration the gravity of the cause, according to Cohen. By the end of the school year, the money was folded back into the UC budget and the Council shifted its efforts toward looking for spaces in existing buildings.
Over the past decade, the Council has periodically taken up the cause again, and promises of better advocacy for the creation of a student center have been a perennial presence on the platforms of UC candidates. Locations floated for the building have included Lowell Lecture Hall, the Inn at Harvard, Boylston Hall, and a lot at 90 Mt. Auburn St. that was eventually taken over by the Harvard University Library.
Most recently, a 2009 UC Social Space Task Force attempted to raise funds to purchase a space in the Square, most seriously considering a building at 45 Mt. Auburn St., the current location of the Democracy Center. After a summer fundraising campaign turned up only $700, the Council spun off the Student Community Center Foundation. By the end of last school year, this most recent cry for a student center had lost momentum.
DECENTRALIZED SOLUTIONS
In the past, the College maintained that the space needs identified by Cohen and other student leaders can be solved by creating a number of smaller social spaces.
The most definitive administrative support that the student center movement received came from Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III and his 1998 proposal for the creation of an all-inclusive “College Hall.”
“The single site is a way of enhancing community at the College,” Epps told the Crimson in 1999.
Yet even at the time, Epps was an exception among administrators.
“The proposal for a student center is not getting the support from my colleagues that it needs,” he added.
As Epps and student leaders lobbied for a student center, administrators searched for decentralized solutions.
“[Top administrators] agreed with many of the needs we identified, but not necessarily that it needed to be a student center,” Cohen remembers of his meetings with the administration as part of the Student Center Working Group.
Student center advocates such as Camp, Cohen, and Epps have run into the reality of space at Harvard—it is limited and expensive.
“Space is our one irreplaceable resource,” Lewis, while serving as dean of Harvard College, wrote in a 1999 memorandum to then-Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Jeremy R. Knowles. “Once land is gone, it is gone forever.”
Under Gross’s tenure from 2003 to 2007, the College attempted to create informal meeting areas and places to socialize within existing spaces, opening the Lamont Café and the Queen’s Head Pub.
Perhaps most controversially, Gross oversaw the renovation of Hilles Library in the Quad to create the Student Organizations Center at Hilles.
ON THE HORIZON?
While the past century has seen repeated calls from undergraduates for a student center, for the first time, support from the President’s office could make it a reality.
In September during an interview with Charlie Gibson in Sanders Theatre, University President Drew G. Faust publicly entertained the idea of transforming the lower floors of the Holyoke Center into a student center.
Then, in a recent interview with The Crimson, she said that the University’s upcoming capital campaign will likely raise the funds necessary for its construction, if the University decides to go ahead with the construction of a student center in the Holyoke Center.
But students say that even if Faust commits University resources to creating a full-scale student center, it will take years to finish the space, leaving many current undergraduates echoing the complaints of students 100 years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of March 2008, Caitlin H. Sarubbi ’13 had her “best week ever.”
On Wednesday, Sarubbi received a letter of admission to the Harvard College Class of 2012, and on Friday, she found out she had secured a nomination for the U.S. Paralympic Games ski team.
Born with Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome (AMS), an extremely rare genetic disorder whose name literally means “born without eyelids and enlarged mouth,” Sarubbi is legally blind and has partially impaired hearing.
A high school senior at the time, Sarubbi was taking Advanced Placement classes and preparing for college, but she was simultaneously training for the Paralympics.
“A lot of my teachers were like ‘Oh, she’s going on a ski vacation, taking two months off,’” she says.
After struggling with balancing academics and athletics in high school, Sarubbi sought a different solution for her college experience, although she was still determined to do both—just not simultaneously.
“2010 is coming up,” she explained to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. “I want to do one semester and take three off to train full time.”
That fall, Sarubbi matriculated to Harvard as a member of the Class of 2012. By the time her classmates were entering their second semester, however, Sarubbi was beginning her road to the 2010 Paralympics in Vancouver.
GOING WITH THE FLOW
Because AMS is so rare, little information exists as to what causes the syndrome.
“I’m one of about 13 people who have it,” Sarubbi says. “There’s not enough people with it to warrant tons of money to research it.”
So far, Sarubbi has undergone 60 surgeries, the first of which happened when she was only three days old. The doctors made eyelids for her in an attempt to prevent further sight loss.
But despite the number of surgeries and the obstacles that she faces, Sarubbi remains positive.
“Health-wise, I’m fine. You just kind of go with it,” she says.
One of Sarubbi’s friends, Jacqueline L. Nesi ’12, says Sarubbi’s positive attitude impresses her.
“She’s going through a lot of things that would make other people bitter,” Nesi says.
FINDING HER PASSION
When she was younger, Sarubbi says she played softball, soccer, and basketball at the community level in her hometown, but she did not discover disabled athletics until 2001.
After Sept. 11, 2001, an organization called Disabled Sports USA wanted to honor New York City firefighters, including Sarubbi’s father, John. The nonprofit invited firefighters with children with disabilities to Breckenridge, Colo., for a week of skiing.
That week in Breckenridge—the first time Sarubbi was introduced to disabled sports—was the beginning of her skiing career.
Upon returning to New York, she met with people from the Adaptive Sports Foundation. She became a student there, joined the ski race team, and then decided to aspire for the Paralympics.
For Paralympic skiers to race, they must have a guide who skis in front of them and leads them down the mountain. The guide and Sarubbi communicate via walkie-talkies, where the guide tells her to head right or left and informs her of upcoming obstacles.
Within a nine-year span, Sarubbi had her first experience in disabled sports, learned to ski, and became a Paralympic-level skiier.
“It just kind of snowballed,” she says.
THE PARALYMPIC DREAM
A year after leaving Harvard following the fall semester of her freshman year, Sarubbi found herself headed to Vancouver for the 2010 Paralympics. During her time there, she competed in all five of the alpine skiing events: downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and super combined.
While she says the weather conditions made her events difficult, she came away with two sixth-place finishes and one eighth-place finish.
“Honestly, I’m happy with it. It’s the Paralympics,” she says. “You really can’t complain. It was awesome.”
Sarubbi notes that one of the best aspects of being in Vancouver was having her family there to support her. The Sarubbis are very close with their extended family and all live within a three-block radius.
The family showed the strength of its relationship when 35 members of Sarubbi’s extended family accompanied her to Vancouver. Sarubbi says that her father took a giant American flag and brought it with him to the Paralympics. He hung it so every camera could see it.
“If you ever watch footage, you can see the flag no matter what. It’s crazy,” she says. “They’re very patriotic.”
Amid the intensity of the Paralympic atmosphere and the uncertainty of the weather conditions, Sarubbi says her family provided comic relief for the coaches and the athletes. Showing their support with their airhorns, sirens, and cowbells, the Sarubbi family brought fun back into the competitive environment.
“It was supposed to be fun and it was a nice relief from business and skiing and seriousness,” she says. “It was a really good balance. I was lucky they were all there.”
THE ROAD TO 2014
While Sarubbi returned to Harvard in the fall, she says that she plans to take more time off to train for and compete in the 2014 Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. Noting that she gained valuable experience from her time in Vancouver, Sarubbi says she is going into the 2014 games with a “different outlook.”
Sarubbi’s guide will be her younger sister Jamie. Sarubbi says she is confident the two will be compatible because of their close age, mutual interests, and familial relationship.
She says she also hopes she will be able to have more fun skiing and not succumb to the pressures of the competitive environment.
“I’m not going to slack off or anything, but just make sure I have fun,” Sarubbi says. “I think if I’m enjoying it, the skiing’s going to come, the results are going to come.”
Eventually, Sarubbi says she hopes to graduate from Harvard and go to medical school. Until then, she will continue her long hours in the gym and on the ski slopes as she prepares for the 2014 Paralympics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up until the 2:46 mark of the second period of the Ivy League championship game Sunday afternoon, everything was going quite smoothly for the No. 17 Harvard men’s lacrosse team.
The squad was hanging tough with the No. 2 Cornell Big Red, containing the highest-scoring team in the conference and holding the nation’s best player, attack Rob Pannell, to just one point.
But suddenly, with the game tied 2-2, a whistle blew.
Crimson junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan was called for a non-releasable illegal equipment penalty, giving Cornell three minutes of man-up play, and the contest was never the same.
Fifty seconds into the advantage, Big Red attack Cody Bremner beat Harvard sophomore goaltender Harry Krieger—who had been sensational in net up to that point—and Cornell midfielder Mitch McMichael scored under a minute later to put the Big Red ahead, 4-2.
Cornell retained possession at the start of the second half, and sophomore Steve Mock added a man-up goal just 10 seconds into the period.
With three scores before the penalty had even ended, momentum had clearly shifted to Cornell’s side. The Big Red would dominate the rest of the contest, winning 15-6 while ending Harvard’s season and its NCAA Tournament dreams in the process.
“We’re certainly disappointed,” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “I think Cornell outplayed us [Sunday], and they deserve it and earned it. But I’m happy with our overall effort.”
After Mike O’Neil added another goal for the Big Red at the 12:03 mark in the third, Harvard tried to fight back. On a man-up chance of its own, senior Matt Hull found sophomore Ryan Stevens open in front of the net, and Stevens beat Cornell goalie A.J. Fiore to trim the deficit to 6-3. After JJ Gilbane responded with a score for the Big Red, junior Terry White cut the lead to three again, sprinting left to right and firing high on the run for the goal.
But at 5:15, that would be as close as the Crimson would get the rest of the way.
Three minutes later, Cornell’s David Lau came over the middle and scored off a pass from Pannell. As he did so, Harvard freshman Joe Petrucci pushed Lau from behind and was called for unnecessary roughness, giving the Big Red another man-up opportunity. After a Krieger save, the goaltender threw an outlet to Vaughan, who dropped the ball, and after Mock picked it up, he had an easy breakaway score. Lau added another goal with 25 seconds remaining in the period, putting Cornell up 10-4 heading into the fourth.
“Cornell is very opportunistic,” Wojcik said. “When we made a mistake, they exploited it, and we made some costly mistakes.”
The Big Red continued to pour it on in the final quarter. Midfielder Jack Dudley extended the lead to seven at 13:15. After Hull responded with a score at 10:55, Cornell added four more goals in a three-minute stretch, as Mock recorded his fourth and fifth tallies of the game and Gilbane and Pannell added their second each. Hull scored again with the game out of reach at 2:09, finishing with a hat trick in his final collegiate contest.
“Their team plays hard every game,” junior Jeff Cohen said. “The level of play they were competing at today was something we couldn’t match...I think you have to give credit to them. They’re a great team, and they came out and outplayed us.”
It was Hull who had responded after Pannell and Mock both beat Krieger low to put the Big Red up 2-0 early. With 5:11 remaining in the opening period, the senior took a pass on the left side of the net, spun towards the middle, pump-faked high, and scored. Stevens then fired a hard shot past Fiore to tie the game at the 11:45 mark in the second. In the meantime, the Harvard defense held Cornell scoreless for a 19-minute stretch after Mock’s first goal, with Krieger making big save after big save. But after Vaughan’s penalty, everything fell apart.
The Big Red dominated nearly every facet of the game, taking more shots (54-31), picking up more ground balls (48-34), and winning more faceoffs (15-8) than the Crimson.
“[Cornell] capitalized and they executed,” Wojcik said. “They made the plays and were able to pull away from us. We didn’t convert some opportunities that we normally have in the past.”
The loss left Harvard on the outside looking in for the 16-team NCAA Tournament for the fifth straight year, as the Crimson’s bubble burst Sunday night. The defeat also ended the career of co-captain Dean Gibbons, the unanimous first-team All-Ivy standout, who will graduate with the ninth-most points in Harvard history.
“Obviously it’s a tough loss,” Cohen said. “It’s tough to end our season this way; it’s a tough way for the seniors to go out. But with us making the Ivy League Tournament, that’s something you can hang your hats on, and it really has been a great journey for our team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CORRECTION APPENDED
After a regular season filled with many individual accomplishments and strong team showings, the Harvard track and field teams did not disappoint at the Heptagonal Championships this past weekend. The men’s and women’s squads traveled to Yale in New Haven, Conn., and emerged with respectable results.
The women’s squad finished seventh, while the men earned fourth in the teams’ final tuneup before the ECAC and IC4A championships next weekend.
According to players and coaches, both Crimson squads derive most of their success this season from the growth and development that they have experienced collectively over the past four years.
“It’s incredible for me to see this senior class—my first recruited class—and to think back where we were four years ago, when they first arrived, to now,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.
Senior distance runner Dan Chenoweth further elaborated by indicating that the team’s development over the years has been reflected in its performance in the Heptagonal championships each year.
“This year’s Heps has been a marked improvement from past years where we finished in seventh place a number of times and scored 30 points or so,” Chenoweth said. “But to come out and score 75 points is definitely a step in the right direction.”
The Crimson certainly showcased its growth and development as a team over the weekend, as both Harvard squads finished with nearly twice as many points in this year’s Heptagonal championships as they did last year. Leading the efforts of the women’s squad were some familiar faces as well as some new stars.
Freshman thrower Hannah Meyer captured the javelin title on the first day of the competition with a throw of 46.16 meters to earn 10 points for the Crimson.
Senior distance runner Claire Richardson finished in fourth in the 5,000-meter race with a time of 16:49.04 to earn her team four points.
In the women’s 4x100 meter relay, freshmen Christina Twicken, Chelsea Celistan, and Meisha Brooks, in addition to sophomore Olivia Weeks, earned a fourth-place finish in the finals and four additional points for Harvard.
On the men’s side, the two-day affair was similarly peppered with promising results for the Crimson. Chenoweth continued a stellar final year for the Crimson, as he finished second in the 10,000-meter and third in the 5,000 meter. The fourth-year runner posted a time of 30:24.92 in the 10,000-meter, just two seconds short of eventual winner junior Donn Cabral of Princeton—the defending Ivy League champion in the 10,000-meter. In the 5,000-meter, Chenoweth finished with a time of 14:15.26.
“I was very pleased with Dan’s performance this meet,” Saretsky said. “Dan was able to not only finish second in the 10K but also third in the 5K. It’s been a really special ride with him, and I’ve really enjoyed working with him and the other seniors on the team.”
With these two results, Chenoweth earned the men’s squad 14 points. Behind Chenoweth, the Crimson relied once again on its depth and broad talent pool on the men’s squad to round out its scoring.
In the men’s 400-meter dash, junior John Dingus placed fifth with a time of 48.25 to earn Harvard two points. Junior Nico Weiler captured the shot put title with a distance of 5.16 m—over a third of a meter more than the throw from second-place finisher, Princeton’s Derek Hynes. [CORRECTION APPENDED]
And the quartet composed of freshman Jared Kadich, sophomores Zach Herring and Julian Sherwin, and Dingus placed fifth in the men’s 4x400-meter relay.
For the men’s squad, its fourth-place finish behind Brown was a bittersweet.
“It was a little heartbreaking finishing in fourth and just one point away from third,” Saretsky said. “But it was still a great meet for us overall.”
While solid performances gained the women 71 points and the men 75 points, neither squad could not keep pace with Princeton, whose women’s and men’s squads finished in first place with 132 points and 197 points, respectively.
With their victories this weekend, the Tigers swept Ivy titles in cross country and both indoor and outdoor track and field, earning the triple crown for both the men’s and women’s teams. Princeton’s performance this season leaves little doubt as to which school dominates the Ivy League in both track and field and cross country.
The Crimson returns back into action next weekend for the ECAC/IC4A tournament next weekend in Princeton, N.J.

CORRECTION
In his story "Crimson Improves At Final Heps Meet," published May 9, Oluwatoni A. Campbell incorrectly stated that junior Nico Weiler took first place in the shot put at the Heptagonal Championships. It was actually freshman Dustin Brode who won the event; Weiler won the pole vault.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s lacrosse team had an automatic NCAA tournament bid snatched away from it in a heartbreaking 12-10 loss to Princeton on Sunday.
The Crimson took a late lead after a dramatic comeback in the second period overcame a five-goal deficit. But Princeton’s late run gave it the win, the Ivy League title, and a NCAA tournament berth.
Two days earlier, Harvard (10-6, 5-2 Ivy) defeated No. 10 Dartmouth (11-4, 6-1) in the semifinals before losing to the Tigers (11-6, 5-2) in the Ivy League championship game at Penn’s Franklin Field.
“I’m incredibly proud of this team,” tri-captain Sam McMahon said. “We have had a great season, and we played hard in the Ivy tournament all the way through the championship game.”
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 10
In Sunday’s championship game, Harvard faced Princeton, a team that fell to the Crimson eariler in the season in a highly-contested matchup. This time around was more of the same, with the game coming down to the final period but leading to the opposite result.
The Crimson stormed back after falling behind 5-0 early to take a 10-9 lead halfway through the second half. But the Tigers responded with three unanswered scores to give Princeton the victory.
“We put ourselves in a very difficult position going down early,” Baskind said. “But [we] are proud of the way we fought back. Our tough schedule has prepared us for situations like that—it was just disappointing to let it happen again.”
Harvard scored consecutive tallies after the initial Tiger run, but Princeton came back with two goals of its own making to push lead back to five.
Even though the Crimson was down, 7-3, at the half, Harvard felt it would be able to get back into the game.
“We knew that it was our fault for the hole we were in at the end of the first half,” McMahon said. “We weren’t burying our shots and executing the defensive game plan, so with those adjustments, we knew we could get back into the game.”
The Crimson came out strong in the second half with three unanswered goals, cutting the Tigers lead to 7-6.
“We finished our shots in the second half,” Baskind said. “I think we played well defensively, and [junior] Kerry Clark had some huge saves.”
Later in the period, Harvard completed the comeback off a 3-0 run with the last two scores coming from sophomore Danielle Tetreault, who had four goals on the day.
The team’s goal of making the NCAA tournament for the fist time since 1994 was within reach, but in the end, the Tigers were able to execute their offense and pull out the victory.
“We won critical draw controls, buried our shots, and were aggressive on the defensive end to make a second-half run,” McMahon said. “[But] in the end, Princeton was able to capitalize on its offensive possessions to put itself back into the lead.”
HARVARD 11, DARTMOUTH 10
In Friday’s contest, Harvard fell behind, 3-1, in the first 10 minutes of the game before making a two-goal run to tie the score at three.
Dartmouth continued its strong play, as the team went on a 5-2 run to make the score 8-5 with a little under 19 minutes to play.
But the Crimson, which had an 18-game losing streak against the Big Green dating back to 1994 going into the game, would not accept another defeat to Dartmouth.
Harvard made a furious comeback. Over the next 16 minutes, the Crimson put away every shot, played solid defense, and took control of the game in a 6-1 rally.
“We were able to get the draws, get quality offensive possessions, and made some great defensive stands,” McMahon said. “We just did all the little things well to get back in the game and pull off the win.”
The run gave the team an 11-9 lead that would prevail in the end, resulting in the upset.
“I think a lot of us feel like the win on Friday was the highlight of the year,” Baskind said. “We had a really tough time putting away our shots the first time we played them. We made it a point of emphasis in practice this past week. We executed our game plan and never doubted ourselves, which is something to be proud of.”
The victory was especially motivating, given that Big Green was co-Ivy League champion and recently beat No. 1 Maryland.
Despite the loss on Sunday, there are many positives to take away from the end of the season. Crimson junior tri-captian Melanie Baskind, junior Jess Halpern, and sophomores Tetreault and Jennifer VanderMeulen earned spots on the Ivy League All-Tournament team. While the team fell short of qualifying for the NCAA tournament, Harvard’s 10 wins on the season were the most for the program since 1994.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might have been the first time that the No. 17 Harvard men’s lacrosse team (10-5, 3-3) appeared in the Ivy League tournament, but it looked like veteran squad, cruising past No. 15 Penn (8-6,4-2) Friday afternoon at Schoellkopf Field and earning a spot in the finals of the Ancient Eight tournament.
“I’m really happy [with Friday’s performance],” said Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “I thought we played really well overall, in all phases of the game.”
Despite coming up short in a heartbreaking double-overtime loss to the Quakers on April 16, Harvard showed no signs of fear.
“That first game was a really close game,” Wojcik said. “In any overtime game, a play here or there [can make] the game go either way. I think we were excited to get another opportunity to play a team we had lost to in overtime.”
The Crimson jumped out to a 2-0 lead early in the first quarter, fueled by two assists from co-captain attack Dean Gibbons. Penn then responded to pull within one. Sophomore midfielder Jack Doyle scored unassisted with 2:48 remaining in the first quarter to go up, 3-1. Freshman attack Daniel Eipp assisted junior attack Jeff Cohen with 17 seconds left in the opening frame widen the margin, 4-1.
The Crimson controlled the tempo of the game and dominated possession, owning a 32-24 groundball advantage and a 13-11 faceoff advantage.
“I thought we came out and really dominated the game from the start,” Wojcik said.  “We were able to build a big lead, and I thought we did a really good job of not only extending that lead but also managing the game and controlling the pace of the play.”
The second quarter saw only more of the same from Harvard, scoring three unanswered goals. Taking advantage of a man-up situation, Gibbons found the back of the net off an assist from junior co-captain Kevin Vaughan, setting the score at 5-1. Less than a minute later Harvard would strike again, with Doyle assisting a Cohen goal with 12:51 left in the second quarter. Another man-up goal kept the Crimson run going and made the score 7-1.
The Quakers finally found the back of the net on a man-up situation with 8:49 remaining in the 2nd quarter. Eipp would respond for Harvard off an unassisted goal, extending the lead back to six. Penn scored with six seconds left in the frame to set the score at 8-3 heading into halftime.
“I think we came out and played hard,” Cohen said. “I think we were the team that wanted it more, and it showed. It was a huge win for us.”
Gibbons headlined the offensive barrage from the Crimson that saw eight different players score. Gibbons earned five points off three goals and two assists, while Cohen also matched his co-captain’s scoring total with three goals.
Sophomore goalie Harry Krieger continued his string of strong performances, anchoring the defense throughout the game and recording a final tally of nine saves. Junior defenseman Paul Pate also made a strong showing, causing two turnovers and scooping up three ground balls.
“I think our defense played great,” Cohen said. “Harry had a lot of big saves. Dean had five points, and [senior] Matt Hull was kind of flying around all over the field. All season those guys have been our leaders, and they’ve stepped up for us whenever we’ve needed them.”
Harvard struck first in the 3rd quarter, scoring off an assisted goal from junior midfielder Terry White. Penn was not out of the game yet and scored two straight goals in a two-minute span, setting the score at 9-5 with 8:31 left in the third. Taking advantage of a man-up situation, sophomore attack Peter Schwartz found the back of the net off an assist from sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens going into the final frame of the game.
The Quakers would make their biggest stand of the game in the final quarter, but it still wouldn’t be enough to overcome the five-goal deficit.
The Crimson struck first, getting the score off an unassisted goal from Vaughan. Another unassisted goal from Gibbons put Harvard up, 12-5, with 10:53 left on the clock. The Crimson would not score again, as an improved Penn defense left the offense unable to find the back of the net. The Quakers rattled off three unanswered goals to close the quarter, but it was not enough to overcome the seven-goal deficit.
“We were able to carry the play throughout,” Wojcik said. “We played with a lot of energy and passion. I was really happy with our performance.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Ivy Champs! Ivy Champs!” the enormous crowd gathered at Soldiers Field cheered, as junior Harvard softball pitcher Rachel Brown pitched the final strike in a strikeout that completed the Crimson’s two-game sweep of Cornell (27-22-1) in this year’s Ivy League Championship Series.
The victory brings Harvard’s overall record to 36-14, a new school record for victories in a season, and earns the Crimson the title of Ivy League champions for the fifth time in team history and the first time since 2007.
But even more significant about the win is that it has allowed Harvard to redeem itself after last season, when it lost the Ivy League title to the Big Red by a single run in the third game of the Championship Series.
“Last year’s team was exceptional—we just came up short,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “I think the seniors really went on a mission this year to come back from that and carried the team with them. They all did a really great job.”
HARVARD 4, CORNELL 0
In the first contest of the series, the Crimson came out ready to score, putting up three runs to gain an early 3-0 lead. Sophomore Stephanie Regan got the Harvard momentum going, as she walked and then advanced to second off of freshman third baseman Kasey Lange’s single to right field. Junior first baseman Whitney Shaw singled to right field and freshman catcher Allison Scott reached first on a fielder’s choice, bringing home Regan. Sophomore Ashley Heritage then smacked a two-RBI triple to left center, plating in Lange and Scott.
The next four innings proved scoreless for both teams, despite several threats from the Cornell offense.
In the bottom of the third inning, the Big Red nearly made a comeback, loading the bases with only one out. But Shaw stopped the potential rally, making an unassisted double play off of a hard hit line drive to first, ending the inning.
Harvard plated in one more run in the top of the sixth, when Lange singled and then scored off of a Scott single to left field, bring the score to 4-0.
In the bottom of the sixth inning, Brown came in to replace rookie pitcher Laura Ricciardone, who allowed only five hits in five innings. The veteran Brown struck out five batters in the final two innings of the game, leading the Crimson to a second straight shutout and earning the team the title.
“Laura and Rachel were phenomenal,” said co-captain and second baseman Ellen Macadam. “Cornell is a great hitting team, and our defense was solid, but it was our pitching that completely shut them down.”
HARVARD 5, CORNELL 0
Despite the rain, lightning, and two hour and 48 minute delay, the Harvard defense stayed ignited throughout the first game of the Championship Series, holding Cornell scoreless in seven innings.
Macadam started off the Crimson’s offensive drive against Big Red pitcher Elizabeth Dalrymple with a lead-off single to right field and a stolen second base. A Regan sacrifice bunt then advanced Macadam to third, and a Lange fly ball to rightfield allowed Macadam to tag up, gaining an early 1-0 lead for Harvard.
After a scoreless second inning, the Crimson plated in another run in the third to set the score at 2-0. Olson reached first and then second via a throwing error and advanced to third on a Macadam sac bunt. In the next at bat, Regan flied out to centerfield, allowing Olson to score unearned.
A scoreless fourth inning was followed by a big fifth inning for the Harvard offense. Olson got the rally started with a double to right center, and advanced to third off of a Macadam sac bunt.  Regan then singled to third base and Lange walked to load the bases with one out.
A Scott two-RBI single brought home Regan and Olson, and Heritage singled to leftfield to plate in Lange, bringing the score to 5-0.
The next two innings passed quickly, with a single hit and no runs scored. The first contest of the Championship Series ended in a Crimson win.
Though earlier in the season the team seemed to heavily rely on its pitching, this was not the case this weekend, as both shutouts resulted from solid contributions from Harvard’s offense and defense.
“I’m so proud of our team,” Lange said. “We completely came together. We had such great senior leadership. Rachel and Laura were awesome on the mound, and our hitters came up big. It was totally a group effort.”
And for co-captains Emily Henderson and Macadam, an Ivy League Championship title is the perfect way to end their Crimson softball career.
“It’s unbelievable,” Macadam said. “We’ve never been able to pull it out my previous years here. Emily and I wanted to go out of our senior year with a win and to finally get that was unbelievable.”

It's no secret that Oscar Wilde often pushed the limits of Victorian decency. So much so that 120 years ago Wilde's only novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray," was edited to exclude material that might be deemed vulgar and objectionable especially to the innocent ears of Victorian women. 
 
However, at the end of April, Harvard University Press released the "uncensored" version to a public now much less likely to put Wilde on trail for charges of indecency and sodomy as he was in 1895. Originally, Wilde was forced to excise passages that highlighted the homosexuality of main character Dorian Gray and the artist Basil Hallward's homoerotic feelings for him. Additionally, references to women as Gray's mistresses were also altered.
Martin Puchner, a Harvard English professor, recently taught a new seminar course "English 90ws: Wilde and Shaw." While he currently uses the old version of "The Picture of Dorian Gray" he said that the new edition offers a "great teaching moment." He also said he would potentially like to teach both version side by side in the future.
Yet, Puchner cautions that just because Wilde made the edits responding to outside pressure does not mean that the edited version is distorted. 
"I would not dismiss the older version by saying it's a censored version," Puchner said, "Authors are under pressure all the time, external constrains can lead to better versions. Now we can show students how authors deal with them and craft novels in response to them." The new version of the novel no doubt offers new avenues of analysis for faculty and students alike. 
“In many ways it is a novel that wears its themes on its sleeves,” he said. “But it merits deeper analysis–one value of the new edition is that it might encourage students who feel that they already know this novel to look at it anew."
