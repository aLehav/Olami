Five Harvard scientists will have more freedom and greater resources to pursue their research after receiving the first grants awarded by Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s new Early Career Scientist program.Among the 50 nationwide grant recipients, announced last Thursday, are Bradley E. Bernstein, who conducts cancer research at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital; Kevin Eggan and Konrad Hochedlinger, both researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute; Amy J. Wagers of the Joslin Diabetes Center; and Rachel I. Wilson ’96, who runs a neurobiology lab at Harvard Medical School.The grant provides each researcher with salary, benefits, and a research budget of over $1.5 million for a six-year period. It also pays for the cost of research space and equipment, according to a news release on the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Web site. Unveiled in March of 2008, the Early Career initiative’s purpose is to help young scientists concentrate on their research by removing concerns about funding.“We saw a tremendous opportunity for HHMI to impact the research community by freeing promising scientists to pursue their best ideas during this early stage of their careers,” said Howard Hughes Medical Institute President Thomas R. Cech in the news release.Each of the recipients, drawn from 33 institutions across the country, have led their own research laboratories for three to five years, putting them at a career stage that the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Web site called the “most productive—and most vulnerable.” Because researchers’ start-up funds from their host institutions typically dry up after this duration, the pressure to secure federal grant money can lead to safe research proposals at the expense of bolder and potentially ground-breaking projects.Wagers, who studies how blood-forming and skeletal muscle-forming stem cells may be harnessed for regenerative medicine, called the grant “enabling” in today’s tight funding climate.“It gives me the opportunity to pursue new directions and be creative in my science,” Wagers said.The other Harvard-affiliated grant recipients—Bernstein, Hochedlinger, and Wilson—did not return requests for comment for this article. Eggan was on vacation and could not be reached for comment.The new grants come at a time when scientists are most in need of support. After five years of flat funding from the National Institutes of Health—the largest source of money for academic research—coupled with rising inflation, scientists are now scrambling for funds from President Obama’s two-year stimulus package, which includes $10.3 billion for the National Institutes of Health and $3 billion for the National Science Foundation.The Early Career program drew more than 2,000 applicants whose work directly related to biology or medicine, according to the Howard Hughes news release. Massachusetts-based scientists received the most grants nationwide, with three going to MIT and two to the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. Another round of Early Career grants is expected in 2012.In addition to providing grant programs, Howard Hughes—a non-profit biomedical research organization headquartered in Chevy Chase, Md.—conducts research in collaboration with universities, medical centers, and other research institutions nationwide.—Staff writer Liyun Jin can be reached at ljin@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard Business School has selected its first-ever Social Entrepreneurship Fellow, the school announced Wednesday.Elizabeth M. Scharpf, a 2007 graduate of the Business School and the Kennedy School, will receive $25,000 to fund a social venture she has started. Her business, Sustainable Health Enterprises, aims to make low-cost sanitary napkins from locally-sourced materials for women and girls in developing countries.The pads, which are being introduced in a pilot project in Rwanda, will allow women and girls to stay at work and in school while they are menstruating. Currently, many African girls miss up to 45 days of school annually—a significant hindrance to their education—because they cannot afford sanitary pads, according to Scharpf. Scharpf said she was grateful for the fellowship because of its potential to increase public awareness of this little-known issue.“It will give girls and women dealing with problems visibility and hopefully encourage others to get involved and address this problem,” Scharpf said.Scharpf said she became interested in social entrepreneurship after she consulted for the Clinton Foundation’s HIV/AIDS Initiative.“I realized that I could do business and do good at the same time,” she said. “There wasn’t a huge trade-off.”Scharpf then enrolled at the Kennedy School and then the Business School before working for the World Bank in Africa.The creation of the Social Entrepreneurship Fellowship, which will be given annually to an HBS alum, is indicative of a growing focus on social enterprise at the Business School. In 2001, the HBS Business Plan Contest added a social enterprise track, and attendance at the school’s Social Enterprise Conference has grown consistently. And with the economic downturn limiting traditional job opportunities, more students have begun to explore social causes.Faculty Co-Chair of the HBS Social Enterprise Initiative Herman “Dutch” B. Leonard ’74, who served on the selection committee for the fellowship, said that the committee was impressed by the volume of worthwhile projects submitted for consideration.“We had a number of really strong projects. This was a difficult choice,” Leonard said. “There were quite a few all of us would have been happy to see as the winner.”  Scharpf’s project was chosen because, in addition to addressing a specific social issue, it will create jobs in the affected community, encourage sustainable agriculture, and promote discussions about sexual health, Leonard said. The Business School would like to expand the fellowship in future years if budgets allow, Leonard said.While Scharpf said she finds the growing profile of social enterprise encouraging, she cautioned about the dangers of seeing the field as a separate niche.“Social enterprise and these ideas really should be a part of every boardroom, whether at the biggest companies in the world or the smallest non-profits in the world,” she said. “The idea is having a great social impact.”—Staff writer William N.

A revised set of requirements for the Astrophysics concentration will make the field more accessible to students interested in the topic, taking the focus off of graduate-level preparation and emphasizing flexibility, according to professors familiar with the changes. The overhaul of the concentration centered on the department’s realization that “we didn’t have to make our requirements embody everything we would expect to see of an applicant to grad school,” said David Charbonneau, a professor of astronomy and the director of undergraduate studies.As a relatively small concentration to begin with, the Astronomy department noticed a “very disturbing trend” of declining numbers of concentrators, said Jonathan “Josh” E. Grindlay, a professor of astronomy. “Astrophysics as a part of physics is becoming more exciting, and we thought, ‘We need an overhaul,’” Grindlay said. “We don’t offer enough exciting and appropriate-level courses.”The modifications to the concentration currently called “Astronomy and Astrophysics” were approved by the Educational Policy Committee earlier this month without revisions, said Stephanie H. Kenen, the associate dean of undergraduate education. The changes come as part of a string of curricular reconsiderations this year. The English department had an overhaul of its concentration requirements approved by the EPC in February, and the Classics department—also citing a desire to remove its course of study from an emphasis on graduate-level rigor—voted to approve wide-ranging changes early this month. Astronomy faculty cited concerns that current requirements forced students to take multiple years of math and physics before gaining access to higher level concentration courses within the department.“Students would go off and start running into exciting topics in physics and [earth and planetary sciences] and math and decide to concentrate in one of those other fields instead,” said Charbonneau. In order to give the new Astrophysics concentration its own introductory sequence, the revised requirements will be grounded by a pair of introductory level courses—Astronomy 16: “Stellar and Planetary Astronomy,” and Astronomy 17: “Galactic and Extragalactic Astronomy”—that resemble the introductory couplings already present in the Physics, Earth and Planetary Sciences, and Life Sciences concentrations.  Both courses in the new introductory pairing will use only single variable calculus, and will provide a rigorous survey of astrophysics—addressing “everything from black holes to the Big Bang,” according to Charbonneau.The department will also offer a secondary field next year for students interested in astrophysics who do not wish to make the subject their primary concentration. PICK AND CHOOSEThe department has fashioned three new upper level courses and an observational course to give students maximum flexibility in choosing the courses they find most appealing.Astronomy 110: “Exoplanets” is for those interested in “how astronomers are finding planets and look for life,” Astronomy 130: “Cosmology” should be taken “if you want to learn about the big bang and the age of the universe,” and Astronomy 120: “Stellar Physics” discusses stars and their formation and degeneration, Charbonneau said. In addition, Astronomy 100: “Methods of Observational Astronomy,” will take students on a field trip to the F.L. Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins in Arizona, where students will be able to gather data using the powerful telescopes located there.Charbonneau said he hopes that every class of concentrators will ultimately be able to take such a field trip and work with telescopes first-hand, and that in the future such trips can be taken to international observatories so that students can also experience a different language and culture.Wanting to embody the spirit of general education and allow concentrators to pursue honors, do a thesis, take a semester abroad, or participate in extracurricular activities, the department has also reduced the total number of concentration requirements from 16 to 12, said Charbonneau.Where the current concentration serves to prepare students for graduate school, the new requirements—while allowing for an exposure to astrophysics—will have to be supplemented with additional courses to allow viable bids for graduate school admission. Senior theses, often an important springboard for graduate school applications, will no longer be required. “We have an obligation to train students who are interested in a solid experience in the natural science, but don’t necessarily want to go to graduate school and become research scientists,” said James M. Moran, chair of the Department of Astronomy, in an e-mailed statement.The Educational Policy Committee’s Kenen said she was pleased with how thoughtful the department had been in their concentration revisions, allowing the EPC to approve them without reservation.“They really sat down and, from scratch, thought about ‘what is the purpose of an undergraduate education?’ and ‘what should that program look like?’” she said.After the department discussed the proposed changes in the spring and fall of 2008, the concentration was approved by the department’s faculty in November 2008 and submitted to the Educational Policy Committee in February of 2009 before being approved earlier this month.As for the name change—the concentration will go from “Astronomy and Astrophysics” to “Astrophysics”—Moran said that it more accurately characterized what students and faculty are doing.“Astronomy as practiced in the modern era is astrophysics,” Charbonneau said. Charbonneau, who e-mailed current Astronomy and Astrophysics students just before the March spring break to announce the changes, was not the only one excited about the new concentration. “I think people are going to love it,” said Christopher W. Stubbs, chair of the Department of Physics and professor of astronomy. “Can you tell I’m happy about it?” —Staff writer Alissa M. D’Gama can be reached at adgama@fas.harvard.edu.

Harvard continued spring break action this week, splitting a doubleheader against the UNC Greensboro Spartans in Greensboro, N.C. on Tuesday, and winning both games of another doubleheader versus the Bryant Bulldogs played Thursday in Smithfield, R.I.In each twinbill, the Crimson (12-6) held its opponents to tight scores in the first games.  Harvard lost, 3-0, to the Spartans in the opening game, and beat the Bulldogs by a slim 2-1 margin in Thursday’s opening matchup.  In the second games, the Crimson offense came alive, and Harvard outscored UNCG (11-15), 10-5, and Bryant (5-20), 8-1, in its evening game versus each opponent.HARVARD 8, BRYANT 1The Crimson’s offense ignited in their second game against Bryant.  “We’re coming out and trying to show teams that we are the real deal,” senior co-captain Bailey Vertovez said.  “We came out with pride in that second game and tried to silence their bats.”  Despite the enthusiasm, the night game was scoreless through three innings.  Senior Hayley Bock sparked the Harvard scoring spree, leading off the fourth inning with a double and coming home on a single by junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor. The Crimson added another run to its lead in both the fifth and sixth innings before closing the door on the Bulldogs with a spectacular five-run seventh inning.The Harvard pitching staff saw a solid performance from the mound as well.  Freshman Julia Moore struck out three batters in three innings.  Junior Dana Roberts relieved Moore and recorded the win, pitching a perfect fourth along the way.  Vertovez contributed two perfect frames before junior Margaux Black stepped in to finish the job.HARVARD 2, BRYANT 1The Crimson hoped to come out against Bryant with that same fire it had in its second matchup with the Spartans.  “We had lulled in the first game [against UNCG], and figuring out how not to lull in the first game on Thursday was one of our goals,” said Vertovez.Harvard scored only two runs, however, both coming later in the game. The Crimson trailed the Bulldogs, 1-0, in the sixth inning when junior Jessica Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer, got on base with a one-out single. Bock then smashed a two-run shot to right center, scoring pinch-runner Black and tallying all the runs Harvard required to pull out the win. The combination of rookie pitchers Marika Zumbro and Rachel Brown made the one-run Harvard victory possible.  Zumbro struck out three Bryant hitters and allowed only six hits and one run.  Brown finished the job, allowing just one walk in four innings, and recording every out by strikeout until a Bulldog flied out to end the game.HARVARD 10, UNCG 5In its second game against UNCG, the Crimson’s offense came alive to match the outstanding performance of the defense from the first game.“We didn’t get the hits that we needed in the first game,” said Vertovez. “But, we battled back and showed them we were able to compete and that we were great hitters.”Harvard pulled away from a 1-1 tie early on in the game, scoring seven runs in the span of three innings.  Sophomore Ellen Macadam sparked the Crimson offense with a single and she continued to swing the bat effectively, putting up three runs, two hits and two RBI.  “[We knew] we needed to get our bats alive and get moving, because scoring early on is very crucial to our game,” freshman Whitney Shaw said about the team’s focus going into its second game against UNCG. Throughout the game, nine different Harvard players contributed to the win with hits.  Vertovez, who also pitched in the game, joined junior Jessica Pledger and Macadam with two hits apiece. Vertovez scored three times during the contest and Shaw drove in three runs. UNCG 3, HARVARD 0The Crimson’s defense put up a strong performance against the Spartans, but Harvard’s offense could not provide the runs necessary to pull out a win.  Brown held UNCG to only six hits and two earned runs.  But, in the third inning, the Spartan offense took charge, scoring two runs after two walks, a single and a Crimson error. The loss was the first of Brown’s career, dropping her season record to 7-1.Harvard was able to put runners on base in each inning, but could never get the hits needed to move players across home plate.

Entering its only west coast trip of the season with a record two games under .500, the women’s tennis team knew that the voyage to California could set the team in the right direction heading into league play next weekend.“We got solid preparation for Ivy season, which is vital to our success this year,” Harvard coach Traci Green said.The Crimson came through when it counted, winning three of its four matches on the trip and leveling its overall record to 7-7, marking the first time the team has reached .500 this year.“We’re really confident entering the Ivy League season,” sophomore Samantha Rosekrans said.HARVARD 5, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 2The Crimson closed its spring break road trip with a 5-2 victory against the Matadors (9-11) on a sweltering Saturday afternoon. “Despite our physical exhaustion, we were able to pull out a victory,” Rosekrans said.In doubles—after Harvard and Cal State Northridge split the first two matches—freshman Camille Jania and captain Laura Peterzan clinched the opening point, squeaking out a 9-7 win.“[Jania and Peterzan] are a great combination,” Green said. “They have so much energy and will on the court. They’re really fun to watch.”In spite of losses on the top-two courts in singles, the rest of the lineup won in straight sets to give Harvard its seventh victory on the season.At No. 3, Rosenkrans won 6-2, 6-3, while freshman Agnes Sibilski managed to win a close second set and took the No. 4 court 6-1, 7-5. Freshman Holly Cao moved to 2-0 on the season in singles with a pair of 6-1 sets. Jania won handily, sweeping her match 6-0, 6-0.HARVARD 7, SANTA CLARA 0After two days off, the Crimson did not lose focus in preparation for the Broncos (7-8), shutting out Santa Clara 7-0. The match marked the first shutout victory for Harvard in over two years. “[The win] really brought us closer together and got everybody excited about the rest of the season,” Green said.To make the occasion even sweeter, the Crimson did not drop a set on the day for the first time since the spring opener against Boston University in 2006.After the Crimson swept the doubles point, Harvard looked to cement its second west coast win in singles play.No. 88 senior Beier Ko defeated her Bronco opponent 6-0, 6-3. Peterzan took her match 6-4, 6-1, as did Rosekrans 6-1, 6-1. Sibilski improved to 7-5 in singles this spring with her 6-3, 6-0 win. Jania edged out a contested first set and then overtook her opponent in the second set to take the match 7-5, 6-1. Freshman Samantha Gridley completed the sweep with her hard-fought contest, sweating out a 7-6 (6), 6-4 win under the sun.“They really deserved the win,” Green said of her players.SAN DIEGO STATE 6, HARVARD 1In the fifth meeting between the Crimson and Aztecs (12-4), No. 25 San Diego State replicated last year’s 6-1 win over Harvard to take the lead in the all-time series 3-2.The lone victory for the Crimson on the afternoon came from Cao, who took the No. 5 court in straight sets 6-4, 6-4. She was playing her first match since last October.“It felt good to be out on the court finally,” Cao said.Cao played well in tournament play earlier in the year, going 6-3 in singles.“She picked up where she left off last fall,” Green said.Playing for the second consecutive day under the California sun may have taken a toll on Harvard, which, according to Green, appeared to be fatigued.“If we had our legs under us, it would have been a closer match,” Green said.HARVARD 4, UC SANTA BARBARA 3The Crimson opened its California trip with a narrow victory over the Gauchos (12-5).Harvard took the doubles point with wins by Rosekrans and Cao at No. 2, 8-5, and Peterzan and freshman Caroline Davis at No. 3, 8-5.The Crimson prevailed over UC Santa Barbara by splitting the singles matches—Harvard won on the first three courts. Rosekrans won the No. 2 court in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. Peterzan recovered after losing the first set at No. 1 to eventually ease her way to a 4-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory. “I really believed that I was still in the match [after the first set]...and that I could turn it around,” Peterzan said.At No. 3, Sibilski similarly defeated her opponent, 3-6, 6-0, 6-2, to seal the win for the Crimson.

Spring break in Southern California instantly conjures images of a beautiful coastline: from riding ocean waves on a surfboard, to lying on a golden beach, soaking up the sun—could there be anything better than this?In the case of the Crimson men’s tennis team, yes—it is likely that Harvard would gladly trade the various charms of the West Coast for a return to full strength and winning ways, culminating in back-to-back Ivy League championships.With the start of the Ancient Eight fixtures only a week away, No. 68 Harvard (8-7) landed in the Golden State for its annual spring break tour. Four outdoor games and eight days later, as an injury-hampered Crimson shuffled its pack, the team left with one win and three straight losses, but overall winning contributions from 11 players. “The teams are good out here, so it meant that everyone was getting a chance to play someone they haven’t been playing back home,” Harvard coach David Fish ’72 said. “Every single guy contributed a win out here, in tough company.”Weakened by the absence of seniors Sasha Ermakov and co-captain Chris Clayton, the trip posed a test of Harvard’s strength in depth—a test, in spite of losses, that proved encouraging.“Overall, it was great,” sophomore Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “We weren’t playing at full strength, so I think it was as successful a trip as it could have been.”SAN DIEGO 5, HARVARD 2On Saturday, the Crimson squared up against No. 75 San Diego, eager to register a win in its last non-conference dual match of the season. Despite drawing level with the Toreros at 2-2, Harvard was unable to muster a win in its last three, tightly-contested singles.“If we had our full squad without any injuries, we would have done a bit better,” Fish said. “But I think that the players that got a chance to play got better every single day, played considerably better than they’ve done in practice, and have shown remarkable team cohesion.”Upon clinching the doubles point with a 8-3 win over the No. 2 sophomore combination of Aba Omodele-Lucien and Will Guzick, the Torero’s early advantage was slashed through a maiden duals win for freshman Mac McAnulty, who is also a Crimson news writer; the Crimson No. 6 outmuscled San Diego’s Levon Brown in a 7-5, 6-1 win.The Toreros roared back with a win at No. 5 over Guzick, before another freshman threw Harvard a lifeline; returning from injury, No. 4 Manghan ground out victory over Juan de Villiers (7-6, 6-1).With three singles points up for grabs, the remaining matches went down to the wire in the top three courts. Unfortunately for the Crimson, no one could prevail in three sets.An opening set win for No. 1 Chijoff-Evans proved a false omen when he lost comprehensively to Dean Jackson (6-4, 1-6, 1-6). At No. 2, freshman Alistair Felton battled in vain, going down 1-6, 6-4, 1-6, while No. 3 Omodele-Lucien retired due to injury as San Diego seized the win.For Chijoff-Evans, adjusting to an ‘al fresco’ playing style proved one of Harvard’s toughest challenges of the week.“Some of the shots that I thought were winners, [Jackson] was just getting them, throwing up lobs, [and] the sun was interfering with my overhead,” Chijoff-Evans said. “It’s remarkably different from playing indoors.”UC IRVINE 4, HARVARD 3With two singles left to play, and the score poised at 3-2, the Crimson needed one more win to clinch Thursday’s match against the Anteaters. However, its hungry adversaries had other intentions.Despite claiming the first set in their matches, No. 2 Felton and No. 5 McAnulty proceeded to lose their second and decisive third sets—going down 4-6, 7-6, 6-1 and 3-6, 6-1, 6-3 respectively—as UC Irvine overturned the score line and consigned Harvard to an unlikely 4-3 defeat.“Big shots don’t work as well outdoors as they do indoors, and I think Felton felt that, because he usually works a great serve-and-volley game,” Fish said. “Here, he has to work the point much longer.”In an unfamiliar doubles lineup, the Crimson began brightly with wins at No.’s 2 and 3, for the makeshift partnerships of Omodele-Lucien/Guzick and sophomore Tim Wu and McAnulty, respectively.Harvard doubled its lead with an accomplished 6-1, 6-2 win by No. 3 Omodele-Lucien, before the Anteaters responded with two wins of their own in a competitive singles period. No. 1 Chijoff-Evans won a hard-fought, three-set thriller (6-3, 2-6, 6-4) to record the third and final Crimson point.SAN DIEGO STATE 6, HARVARD 1Coming up against the No. 37 Aztecs on Wednesday, the Crimson expected a fight for every point if it wanted to overcome its toughest opponent of the tour. For a young Harvard lineup faced with unfamiliar playing conditions, it proved a test too far.“It’s a slightly different style, because [San Diego State doesn’t] play indoors at all,” Fish said. “So they were very good on defense, they setup points well, and had good shape.” Harvard had started energetically in the doubles, yet was left with nothing to show for its efforts; in three closely-fought matches, the Crimson forced their San Diego State counterparts into extra points, with the latter triumphant in all three. In the closest upset, No.1 duo Chijo-Evans and Felton competed hard against the No. 57 pairing in the nation, Achim Ceban and Giovanni Vaglietti—with the Aztecs ultimately coming out on top (9-8).Omodele-Lucien claimed Harvard’s sole point with a 7-6, 6-2 win at No. 4 singles.HARVARD 4, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT 3In the opening fixture, following a closely fought doubles point, the Crimson tamed the Lions to secure their solitary win of the tour.Losing the No. 3 doubles, Harvard clawed its way back through a win by the No. 1 partnership of Chijoff-Evans and Clayton (8-6). Upon his return from injury, Ermakov teamed up with Felton at No. 2 to clinch the point in a thrilling 9-8 win.In the singles, wins for Chijoff-Evans, senior Michael Hayes and Omodele-Lucien ensured the Crimson began its week in style.—Staff writer Allen J.

According to the PGA West website, “the name Nicklaus has long been associated with greatness on a golf course. The 18 major championships. The electrifying finishes.”This certainly was the case on Thursday, as the Harvard men’s golf team was narrowly edged out by University of California at Riverside, 305-307, at the Nicklaus Tournament Course of the Club at PGA West in La Quinta, Calif.“I was the first one in, so I didn’t see how the other guys behind me were doing,” freshman Mark Pollak said. “Judging by the play throughout the match, I thought we had a chance to pull this one out. I guess that just wasn’t the case.”Despite the close finish of the competition, Pollak also acknowledged the exhibition style of the round.“It was more just for fun,” Pollak said. “We kind of just went out there and played our own game and enjoyed each others’ company and enjoyed the weather. We weren’t playing in a match format, so it wasn’t so much a competition.”The head-to-head tournament relied on the play six, count-four format, which allowed six golfers to compete, with the top four contributing to the team total. Rookies Pollak and Connor Wentzell, sophomore Danny Amira, juniors Greg Shuman and Danny Mayer, and senior John Christensen filled the ranks for the Crimson.Andrew Patipaksiri, who transferred from New Mexico State two years ago, lowered his stroke average from 75.1 last season to 72.7 this season and led the Highlanders with a 74. But matching him stroke-for-stroke, the Crimson’s Pollak tied Patipaksiri for the tournament lead.“I was playing really well,” Pollak said. “I was hitting the ball great. I could have gotten a lot more out of the round, but I guess I had a good day.”With his 74-finish on Thursday, Pollak continues his dominating rookie campaign, which featured a ninth overall finish at the two-round Big 5 Invitational (71-75) where he lead all players in par-5 holes with a -4 average.Harvard’s second-place finisher, Shuman, shot 76 on the day—just a stroke behind UC Riverside’s Mark Alvarez at 75.And while Christensen matched Highlander Scott Clayton at 78 for each team’s respective third-place individual, Wertzell finished at 79, just a stroke behind UCR’s Tom Lo.With the Crimson’s second and fourth spots finishing a stroke behind the Highlander’s second and fourth spots, Harvard just missed out on a dual-match win.“While we didn’t play as well as we would have liked, a lot of good work was done over spring break,” captain Mike Shore said. “We were just trying to get the rust out and that’s what [the California trip] is all about.”Mayer and Amira both shot 84 on the day, while UCR’s five and six—Bruce Doucett and Daniel Brainard—shot 81 and 82, respectively.Four more Crimson golfers competed individually, not contributing to the team results. Junior Nick Moseley and Shore both shot 79 on the par-72 course. Junior Peter Singh shot an 83, while freshman Tony Grillo finished the day at 92.With sunny skies and 89-degree highs, Harvard enjoyed the great California weather before its return to New England for the remaining slate of tournaments.“All the spring break trips have been absolutely fantastic,” said Shore of his four experiences. “Personally, I’ve been pretty fortunate and very appreciative to go [with the team].”Next up for the Crimson is the Yale Spring Opener, where Harvard will get its first look at Ivy League competition before the Ivy League Championships taking place later this month.“We could practice way more than if we stayed [in Cambridge],” Pollak said of getting the chance to play in California. “We got to feel like how a southern U.S. team could. We were able to get some practice instead of staying stagnant [in Cambridge].”—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s home game against Yale on Saturday was charactertized by passion, fury, and a whole lot of chasing. The recipe worked for the Crimson, which came away with an 8-5 win over its archrival.
In a game full of whistles and penalties, both teams demonstrated their determination and aggression throughout the 60 minutes. Coming off two losses to No. 12 Boston University and Albany, Harvard (4-5, 1-1 Ivy) aimed to defeat the Bulldogs (2-9, 0-3 Ivy) for the first time in two years. Yale, too, came into the game ready to win after suffering a close loss to No. 19 Dartmouth the week before. 
Led by senior Kaitlin Martin and sophomore Jess Halpern, the Crimson would dash Yale’s aspirations right from the start, outshooting the Bulldogs, 14-7, in the first half. Just 1:09 into the game, Halpern put the first of her three goals into the net, and her 30th goal of the season, behind Yale goaltender Whitney Quackenbush. 
“It was amazing,” Halpern said of the win. “This was the first game that we all came together, all worked hard, did everything that our coach wanted, and it worked. Luckily we were able to win.”
Halpern, ranked fifth in the nation going into last week in goals per game (4.00), has tallied at least three goals in eight of Harvard’s last nine games this season and is riding a 20-game scoring streak.
Five minutes later, the Bulldogs rebutted with the help of Jessica Sturgill and Jenna Block, tying the game at one. As the rest of the period wore on, both teams found themselves chasing the ball and each other for a total of 13 minutes without any goals scored. 
But that changed when the Crimson posted two goals within 17 seconds of each other. Freshman Katie Doherty scored with 7:13 left in the first half on a free position shot after a whistle on Yale. Martin then hurled the ball into the back of the net soon after, scoring her first of four goals to give Harvard a two-point lead. 
Going into the last five minutes of the half, both teams seemed to be cautious with the ball, passing along the outside and waiting for the perfect opportunity. The Bulldogs’ Logan Greer found that opportunity with 3:31 left, scoring against freshman Kerry Clark, who notched five saves in the game. 
But Harvard, unfazed, soon countered with its own goal by Martin with nine seconds left, giving the Crimson a 4-2 lead going into the second half.
“I think the games that we have been playing, we played in waves,” Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. “We wouldn’t play hard for 60 minutes, we would play hard for spurts, but then they would catch us in our down periods, or we would start slow or we would relax a little bit. [Today] they played as hard as they could for the whole game.”
As the second half began, Harvard’s defense and offense again came out strong. A little over a minute into the period, Halpern again scored, giving her team a comfortable lead at 5-2. Clark and the Crimson defense too provided the team’s backbone, deflecting two Yale shots in the first minutes of the second frame. 
“I thought Kerry had huge saves when we really needed them; I thought Sam had a huge takeaway when we really needed one,” Miller said.  “They played hard, which we need to do for the rest of the season.”
But, in typical Harvard-Yale fashion, the Crimson soon saw its lead diminish. In a 10-minute stretch, Yale scored three-straight goals to tie up the game with 17:57 left of play.
Martin, though, put Harvard back on top, taking a pass from junior Sara Flood and scoring her second goal with 10:23 on the clock. Outshooting Yale by a total of 23-17, and holding a 16-13 advantage in ground balls, the Crimson offense continued to attack. Two minutes later, Martin scored another goal. 
“She’s our leading scorer,” Halpern said. “Without her, our offense would not do as well as it does. She scores, assists, she’s one of the leaders on the offensive end.”
Yale’s Sara David attempted to close the gap but Clark made a quick stick save. 
Martin capitalized with less than three minutes left on her final shot, extending Harvard’s lead to 8-5. 
“I was pleased with their effort,” Miller said. “They hustled, they tried to stay in structure the whole time, and they did little things right. You want to constantly work and work and focus on fundamentals and make good decisions, and I thought they did that for most of the game.”

Sunny California brought only good things to the Harvard women’s water polo team last week, as the team recorded two big wins and two close losses to finish up its last tune-up games before the start of conference play.After a tough 20-2 loss to No. 1 Stanford, and then a tight win against unranked Sonoma State earlier in the week, the Crimson (7-9) came into the last four games of the week a little tired but ready to attack. And attack they did.In the four-game series, Harvard scored a total of 38 goals, proving that the team has what it takes to match up against some of the toughest competition in the nation.“I thought it was a very successful trip,” Crimson coach Erik Farrar said. “We played some very good polo, learned some valuable lessons both on success and failure. The whole idea is to get everybody ready for what really matters, because that’s when we need to be sharpest, but I’m very pleased with where we are.” Harvard hopes to take these new lessons into next Saturday’s games against Hartwick and Brown.“I think we improved a lot from the beginning of the trip to the end,” freshman Devan Kennifer said. “We met some good competition that was good for our team. ” HARVARD 17, CAL STATE MONTEREY BAY 10In its last day of play before returning back to Boston, the Crimson attacked right from the start, grabbing a quick 3-1 lead over the Otters (7-23) Friday afternoon in Seaside, Calif. As Cal State continued to fight back, tying the game at five, the Harvard team, especially its freshmen, refused to relinquish the lead. With three tallies from freshman Shannon Purcell, and one goal apiece from freshmen Lizzie Abbott and Monica Zdrojewski and junior Roxanne Pinto, Harvard made a splash going into the second half. The main force, though, came from the hand of Kennifer, who scored 10 goals—as many as the entire Cal State team. “Our freshmen played very well, our whole team played very well,” Farrar said. “We did a good job of getting our centers involved and creating space for them. Everybody is doing well.”Stealing the ball 20 times, the Crimson continued to put pressure on the Otters, outscoring Cal State, 6-1, in the final two periods. As the Otters continued to look for opportunities to climb back, freshman goalkeeper Laurel McCarthy made three saves, extending her own record to a perfect 2-0.“We just had a factor,” Farrar said. “We figured out what they were trying to do and then locked down with our defense.”  UC DAVIS 5, HARVARD 3Playing its second game of the day on Thursday, the Crimson had every right to be sluggish. But instead of giving the No. 11 Aggies (17-7) an easy win, Harvard managed to make a comeback in the second half after falling behind early, pulling the final score within two.“The best game we probably played was against Davis,” Farrar said. “We didn’t shoot all that well, but it was a very physical game. They were just rolling all of their defense through, and we were going stroke to stroke with them. That was one of our best defensive games of the year.”Trailing 4-1 going into the second half, Harvard scored twice with shots from Kennifer and Purcell, while co-captain and goaltender Nicola Perlman, who is also a former Crimson magazine chair, made nine saves in net. “We need to do a better job of sticking the [goal] in the net,” Farrar said. “But that was a magnificent effort. They are starting to come together in a very happy way.”Despite the loss, Harvard managed to hold Davis to only five goals, a special feat since the only other team to do so was No. 1 Stanford earlier this month. HARVARD 12, UC SANTA CRUZ 8Earlier in the day, the Crimson also found itself down in the first quarter, trailing the Division III Banana Slugs (11-12), 3-1.  But with a barrage of shots from Harvard’s drivers, the Crimson went on a 4-0 run and took a 5-3 advantage.  Although Santa Cruz tied the game, Harvard pulled away thanks to six saves from McCarthy in net and six goals from Kennifer.“We stuck it to the Banana Slugs pretty deeply,” Farrar said.In addition to Kennifer’s tallies, the Crimson saw two goals apiece from Zdrojewski and freshman Ita Barton-Kettleborough. Purcell and Abbott also had a hand in the action, each putting one shot in the back of the net.PACIFIC 7, HARVARD 6Playing Pacific (7-17), Harvard found itself in trouble right from the start. As the Tigers scored the first seven goals of the game, and Perlman had to make save after save in the first half, it was not until the second quarter that the Crimson made it onto the scoreboard.“We played somewhat sloppy and poor defense in the first half, but once we woke up, we came streaming on back,” Farrar said. “Once you give a team a lead, you can’t expect [a win] to happen.”In the second half, Harvard increased the intensity, outshooting Pacific, 5-0. With Perlman anchoring the defense with eight saves, the freshman class began to shoot and score. Kennifer converted four shots, while Abbott and Zdrojewski scored one each. But in the final minute, Pacific maintained possession of the ball, leaving the Crimson one goal away from a comeback win.

Two Harvard swimmers donned their crimson and white this past weekend to represent themselves and their team at the 2009 NCAA Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships in College Station, Texas. Senior butterfly standout Bill Jones returned to NCAAs for the second straight year, while junior distance go-to man Alex Meyer made his first appearance at the championships.Jones raced in the two events that have set him apart from the competition this past season—his signature 100-yard and 200-yard butterfly. Jones placed 28th in the 100-yard butterfly, touching the wall in 47.11 and marking an improvement on his 47.35 time from 2008.Jones also competed in the 200-yard butterfly, but he was disqualified due to a stroke violation.Meyer had a solid showing at his first NCAA meet, making waves in both the 500-yard freestyle and the 1650-yard freestyle. The Ithaca, N.Y. native recorded a time of 4:24.38 in the 500-yard freestyle, earning 44th place in the event. Meyer also finished 25th in the 1650-yard freestyle with a time of 15:06.58.As the Harvard men’s swimming and diving season finally comes to a close, the team knows it will sorely miss the leadership and athletic prowess Jones has provided for the past four years. However, the Crimson faithful also know where to look for future success—they can expect big things from Meyer in 2009-10.—ALEXANDRA J. MIHALEK

Southern California was the spring break destination of choice for the women’s golf team, which showed it could handle the heat just fine. The lone East Coast representative in a battle of California schools, the Crimson competed in the Desert Individual Classic last Friday and was by no means left out in the cold.Taking on players from Stanford, UC Berkeley, UC Davis and UCLA, the Harvard contingent held its own in the 18-hole individual tournament, held at the famed Stadium Course at La Quinta, a par 72, 6,166-yard course. Two Crimson golfers placed within the top eight, and four within the top twelve.“It was a really successful day,” coach Kevin Rhoads said. “All the other teams can play through the wintertime, and we’re trying to shake off rust...to be as sharp, at least for a day, as some of those other schools is very encouraging.”The squad’s overall performance was especially impressive considering UCLA is the nation’s top-ranked team, and Berkeley and Stanford are both within the top 25.In fact, although it was not officially a team event, if the tournament had been scored in the usual team format, the Crimson would have placed second, merely two strokes behind UCLA.Senior Emily Balmert led the way for Harvard, shooting a two-over 74, good for a tie for third place.  Compiling a solid scorecard of two birdies, two bogeys, and one double bogey, Balmert was only one stroke off medalists Pia Halbig from Cal and Tiffany Joh of UCLA. “Shooting two-over-par the first time you ever see a golf course is pretty impressive,” Rhoads said. “It was a really, really solid round.”Crimson freshman Christine Cho was not far behind, placing in a tie for eighth place with a five-over-par 77, and classmate Jane Lee and junior Claire Sheldon rounded out the top dozen, both finishing with seven-over-par 79s.Cho was actually even par on the front nine, accumulating three birdies, but she went five-over on the final leg of the course. A double bogey on her last hole provided a disappointing finish to what could have been one of the top three rounds of the day. Nonetheless, it still was a positive showing from the rookie.“My putting helped me out a lot, but the double bogeys messed me up a little bit,” Cho said.Fellow freshman Lee impressed her coach as well with an impressive display of consistency on the big stage.“I’m really pleased with Jane shooting 79,” Rhoads said. “Her results were up and down in the fall, and they’ve been up and down so far on our spring trip. She has a lot of potential and when she puts it together, she can do things like what she did [Friday].”For her part, Sheldon overcame difficulties with her long game all day.“She said she drove it okay, but she did not hit solid iron shots,” Rhoads said. “On a course like this, to not be approaching well and still shoot a pretty darn good score—that’s very impressive.”Sophomore Mia Kabasakalis finished with an eight-over-par 80, tied for 17th, and in 20th place was senior Ali Bode with an 82.Juniors Caroline Vik and Sarah Harvey rounded out the pack with 93 and 97, respectively.With its West Coast swing now over, Harvard must readjust to the conditions of its home turf. “Now we’re going to go back to the norm—which is not very many repetitions, and when we do play, it’s a lot colder...so we need to transition as quickly as we can,” Rhoads said.The Crimson jumps back into action at the Brown Invitational at Brockton, Mass. this weekend.—Staff writer Dennis J.

While many college students spent their Spring Break soaking up the sun in Cancun or Cabo, the Harvard men’s volleyball team hit the road looking to build on its late-season success. This past weekend, the Crimson (10-6, 5-1 EIVA Hay) defeated league opponents NYU (6-18) and Sacred Heart (11-7), putting Harvard in a tie for first place with Rutgers-Newark in league play and giving the Crimson a shot at the playoffs. “This is the closest I have been in my career,” co-captain Brady Weissbourd said. “This is a really exciting team to be doing this with. We have a really good shot in the playoffs. It would be a great way to end my career.”  HARVARD 3, SACRED HEART 2Less than one day after defeating NYU, the Crimson faced its second opponent in league foe Sacred Heart. Despite a lackluster performance, Harvard managed to leave Fairfield, CT., with another 3-2 (30-27, 25-30, 28-30, 32-30, 15-13) win. “We didn’t play nearly as well,” coach Brian Baise said. “We were tired physically and emotionally [from the NYU match]. To get that win last night in the fifth game and to come in here and face a very good Sacred Heart team, we were just a little bit drained.”Despite registering 19 kills and hitting .385 in the first set, the Crimson could not find any fuel for its offensive game. In the second and third sets, Harvard managed only 11 and 15 kills, respectively. This allowed Sacred Heart to take a 2-1 lead over the Crimson.“[Sacred Heart]’s a really good team,” Weissbourd said. “They serve much better than NYU, actually. It was hard to come off a huge win and come back the next day to play an extremely focused game. In the end, we sort of got it into our heads that we needed this win just as much as we needed last night’s.”But just when it looked like Sacred Heart would earn the victory, Harvard’s star players made just enough plays to keep the Crimson in contention. Weissbourd had his second 31-kill performance in two days, and junior setter Gil Weintraub was once again reliable on the court, dishing out 63 assists. “Gil was able to keep the offense going even when we weren’t attacking very well,” Baise said. “Our liberos, senior Jeff [Nathan] and freshman Dan [Schreff], also made some very big plays.” HARVARD 3, NYU 2With over a week of rest since its previous game, a rejuvenated Harvard team found just enough energy to muster a 3-2 (28-30, 33-35, 30-26, 30-26, 15-13) victory over host NYU. “It was a great match,” Baise said. “I thought it was really high quality volleyball for two and a half hours.”“This was a huge game, and everybody had it on their minds for weeks,” Weissbourd said. “I don’t think I’ve ever beaten NYU at NYU in my career. They came out to play and they played really well.”With the Violets taking a highly-contested first set, 30-28, the Crimson looked to rebound in the second set. Harvard gained an 8-5 lead over its counterpart after a kill by Weissbourd and consecutive attack errors by NYU. Just moments later, however, NYU junior hitter Michael Ferragonio carried his team right back with two consecutive kills to give NYU a slim 16-15 advantage. The two teams would trade points until a block by freshman Luke Hamlet gave the Violets another close victory. Facing a 2-0 deficit, the Crimson changed its strategy going into the third set. “We went back to focusing on fundamental things we needed to do such as defense and our transition game,” Baise said. “When we start to focus on the little things, we can build energy. We try not to look at the big picture—the fact that we’re down 2-0. We really wanted to take one point at a time.”Harvard jumped out to another quick start in the third set, this time with a 7-3 lead. With another comeback attempt by NYU, the Crimson turned once again to Weissbourd. In a crucial stretch, Harvard’s go-to player provided two kills and two key blocks to pull the Crimson ahead 26-22. “We put Brady on their best hitters, and that helped a lot,” Baise said. “He made it much more difficult for their star hitter [Devin Zolnowski] to attack. We started to serve much more aggressively, and it worked.” Rookie Matt Jones finished things off with an impressive kill and service ace, giving Harvard its first set victory. “We were down 2-0, and really our guys just buckled down,” Baise said. “Mentally, it was one of our strongest efforts of the year. It’s not easy to come down from 2-0. To the credit of our players, we climbed our way back into that match.” Weissbourd once again had another impressive showing, registering 31 kills and a career-high 12-block performance. “In a match like this, we turned to him in all aspects of the game, and he was here for us every time,” Baise said.Jones played a solid role as well, notching 17 kills and seven digs for the Crimson. After a 30-26 victory in the fourth set, Harvard found itself in a struggle for the match victory in the fifth set. Finally, after trading points back and forth, junior Erik Kuld slammed the ball down to give the Crimson the come-from-behind victory. —Staff writer Kevin T.

In the 2009 season opener for the Radcliffe lightweight crew team, the Black and White managed to prevail in two out of three races against Holy Cross and Smith College at Lake Quinsigamond yesterday.“It was really great to get a first race under our belt as we prepare for Georgetown next week,” captain Rebekah Kharrazi said. “Today, we raced heavyweight teams that are actually not in our league, so next week is the real beginning, because we are racing teams in our own league.”The Varsity Eight and Novice Eight each cruised to victory over their heavyweight rivals while the Second Varsity Eight placed behind Holy Cross.The Varsity Eight, finishing with a time 6:35, bested the Crusaders by a comfortable four seconds.The Smith Pioneers finished in third place with a time of 6:43.  Holy Cross won its only race of the day over the Second Varsity Eight, finishing 6.1 seconds ahead of the Black and White with a winning time of 7:23. Radcliffe finished at 7:29.1, and Smith finished third at 7:36.8 The Novice Eight, finishing in 7:22, featured the closest race of the day, topping Smith by a mere one second.The Crusaders finished third with a time of 7:29.“We had a definite race plan going into day that we’ve worked on for the past month we’ve been in the water,” sophomore Leah Schwartz said. “We had a lot of composure today.Having a lot of confidence and keeping our heads in our own boat put us across the finish line first.”Though the water on the lake was calm, the elements did not make it easy for the rowers.“The water was flat and there wasn’t too much in terms of current or waves,” Schwartz said. “There was a ton of rain. It started raining from the moment we got off the bus to the moment we got back on, and it was pretty cold.”Despite the difficult conditions, the Black and White lightweights are excited to finally be racing after an intense pre-season training regime.“We’ve been training really hard and just came off of spring break,” Kharrazi said. “We trained here over spring break. When everyone empties out of campus, we stick around and train.”Though the lightweights came close to achieving a clean sweep, the results of their races where a lot closer compared to the team’s blowout margins of victory in 2008.The last time these crews faced one another, the Black and White swept all three races by at least ten seconds, with the Novice Eight winning by an impressive 18 seconds. Yesterday marked the first dual-race for new Radcliffe lightweights coach Heather Cartwright and assistant Carrie Morelock.“We’re extremely excited to have Heather coaching us this year.” Kharrazi said. “She’s coming from downstream at BU and knows the Charles. She’s been around and has a lot of experience and brings a lot to the table.”Saturday will feature the season opener for the Black and White’s heavyweight team against Brown while the lights will face Georgetown at the Class of 2004 Cup in Washington D.C. Radcliffe expects the competition to only intensify in the coming weeks.“Looking forward to future, just having composure isn’t going to be enough and continuing to work hard together as an eight is going to be necessary,” Schwartz said.—Staff writer Robert T.

It was the weekend the Harvard softball team had been waiting for all season, but in the team’s Ivy League opener, something just wasn’t quite right.The Crimson’s (13-7, 1-1 Ivy) bats were quiet as the team split a twinbill with Columbia (9-15, 1-1) Saturday afternoon at the Baker Complex in New York, N.Y.Riding another outstanding performance from freshman hurler Rachel Brown, Harvard took the first game, 1-0, but the team’s lack of offensive production caught up to it in the second contest, which the Lions won by a 2-0 count.“We just didn’t get the hits that we needed when we needed them,” co-captain Bailey Vertovez said. “We might have put a little too much pressure on ourselves. It wasn’t happening for us yesterday.”Rain postponed the Crimson’s doubleheader with Penn to this afternoon at 1 p.m. in Philadelphia.COLUMBIA 2, HARVARD 0Columbia’s Maggie Johnson had Harvard’s number both on the mound and at the plate in Saturday’s second game. The sophomore pitched a complete game shutout and drove in both of the Lions’ runs with a fourth-inning homer. “After the second game, we were obviously disappointed,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “We were hitting a lot of shots, but we definitely didn’t have a lot of luck behind us.”Sophomore Ellen Macadam got Harvard started on the right foot, launching a double to center field in the top of the first.She advanced to third on a groundout from junior Jess Pledger, who is also a Crimson photographer, but Bock flied out to end the inning.The Crimson had another good chance in the fourth, when Pledger got things going with a one-out single.Rookie pinch runner Jane Alexander moved to second on a Bock sacrifice and advanced to third on a single off the bat of classmate Whitney Shaw. But that was as far as she would get, as junior Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, grounded out to end the inning.Vertovez pitched strongly through the first three frames, not allowing a runner past second base, but Columbia broke the scoreless tie in the fourth.Junior Dani Pineda led off the inning for the Lions with a single to right field and came home on Johnson’s bomb. Freshman Julia Moore came on in the fifth and pitched two innings of scoreless relief, but the Crimson couldn’t string together enough hits to get on the scoreboard. “We wanted to score runs immediately, and when it wasn’t happening, we got a little frustrated,” Vertovez said. “I think it was good to get the first loss over with and move on.”HARVARD 1, COLUMBIA 0In Harvard’s Ivy opener, Brown stole the show once again. The rookie pitched a complete-game, one-hit shutout, fanning 14 batters, to give her team the narrow 1-0 victory. “With Rachel on the mound, we felt pretty confident, even though we weren’t scoring a lot of runs,” Bock said.The Crimson got all its offense in the second inning. After Shaw drew a one-out walk, Schellberg and Vertovez loaded the bases with a pair of two-out singles. Junior center fielder Stephanie Krysiak, who is also a Crimson sports editor, was hit by a pitch to bring Shaw home with the game’s only run. Vertovez led the offense with two of the team’s four hits, but the rest of the game was all Brown. The freshman allowed just two baserunners, with Columbia’s only hit coming on a Keli Leong second-inning single, and she struck out the side in the second, fourth and seventh. Harvard went down in order in the third, fourth and fifth, and although sophomore Emily Henderson drew a leadoff walk in the sixth, she couldn’t advance past second base.“I think we’re going to try to switch up the lineup and spread out our hitters who have been hitting the ball well,” Vertovez said. “We were all having great at-bats—it just wasn’t falling in. We just need to keep swinging.”The team didn’t get its offense going until the seventh, when Vertovez and Krysiak strung together back-to-back two-out singles. But Macadam grounded out to end the threat.“With Ivies, I think people thought that things were going to change,” Bock said. “Nothing needs to change. We have to play just like we did in preseason, play more relaxed, swinging at good pitches and [good] things will definitely follow.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

NEW YORK—Coming into the Harvard baseball team’s doubleheader with Columbia (4-16, 2-0 Ivy) on Saturday, the Crimson (2-16, 0-2) found itself sharing the diamond with a kindred spirit, albeit for all the wrong reasons.Each team arrived at the onset of the Ivy League season reeling from an extensive and difficult non-conference slate, and equipped with only two wins to its name and the sliver of hope that materializes when there is reason for optimism that the worst is over.But while the Lions took the beginning of Ancient Eight play as a cue to change its season’s trajectory, Harvard trudged on, by itself, along the same downward slope.The Crimson left Columbia’s Robertson Field on the wrong side of a sweep in Saturday’s twinbill, falling, 8-3, in Game 1 before dropping Game 2 by a score of 8-6.The Harvard pitching staff battled ineffectiveness in the first contest, allowing the Lions to jump out to an early and insurmountable lead in the seven-inning game.The nightcap initially appeared more promising for the Crimson, but shaky defense and an eighth-inning meltdown eventually sealed the team’s fate.“We didn’t play well at all,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “It was not a good day for us.”COLUMBIA 8, HARVARD 6After the Crimson defense allowed the Lions to climb back from a 3-1 deficit and force a tie with run-scoring errors in the fourth and fifth innings in the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader, Harvard’s pitching fell apart in the eighth, giving Columbia all it needed to complete its sweep.Freshman starter Conner Hulse—who had given up just one earned run in his first seven innings of work—succumbed to fatigue in the eighth frame. Following a single and wild pitch, cleanup hitter Dean Forthun ripped a double down the left-field line to give Columbia a 4-3 lead and chase Hulse off the mound.“[Hulse] worked his ass off,” said senior right fielder Tom Stack-Babich. “It looked like he got a little tired at the end, but I thought he did pretty well.”Walsh brought in reliever Jonah Klees to stop the bleeding, but the rookie was unable to contain the Lions. With runners on second and third, Klees intentionally walked the bases loaded before yielding a three-run double. The Lions added an additional run in the frame and headed into final inning up 8-3.“We have flashes of good stuff, and then we go and give up five-run innings,” a frustrated Stack-Babich said. The Crimson managed to make things interesting with a two-out rally in the top of the ninth. Senior second baseman Taylor Meehan crushed a double to the gap in right-center, plating junior first baseman Dan Zailskas. Senior left fielder Matt Rogers came up next and belted a long fly ball into the wind that cleared the center-field fence to bring Harvard within two runs. But the comeback attempt fell short when Harvard captain Harry Douglas made the final out of the game on a sharp grounder to first base.COLUMBIA 8, HARVARD 3Pitching made all the difference in the Crimson’s Ivy League opener.Harvard’s hurlers fell behind on counts throughout the game, opening the door for hard hits and costly walks.Sophomore starter Dan Berardo, who has struggled mightily since his first start against Jacksonville State on March 6 garnered him Ivy League Pitcher of the Week honors, gave up back-to-back homers in the second inning before losing control of the strike zone in the third.Berardo only managed to get through 2 2/3 innings of work and his replacement, freshman Marcus Way, did not fare any better.Way entered the game after Berardo walked a run in with the bases loaded, giving Columbia a 3-2 lead, and immediately gave up a two-run double. Way then issued a pair of walks to force another runner in before getting out of the inning. But the damage was done, and the Lions entered the fourth frame with a 6-2 advantage that they would not relinquish.“We have to cut down on giving up big innings,” Walsh said. “We’re having mental breakdowns.”On the flipside, Columbia received its first of two solid outings by its starters on the day in the form of a complete-game, three-run effort by pitcher Joe Scarlata.“I thought their pitchers pitched good,” Walsh said. “They threw a lot of sliders and we didn’t make adjustments.”Douglas and Stack-Babich provided all of the Crimson’s production at the plate in Game 1. Douglas got Harvard on the board with a two-run double in the top of the second and Stack-Babich blasted a solo shot out to dead center in the third.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a crushing 9-8 overtime loss at Georgetown, the No. 13 Harvard men’s lacrosse team showed its resilience by defeating Presbyterian (S.C.) College, 17-2, on Friday. The Crimson (5-2) faced the Blue Hose (0-9) for the first time ever on a neutral site at George Walton High School in suburban Atlanta, but Harvard did not let any of these peculiarities prevent it from putting together a complete game. Sophomore attack Dean Gibbons scored the first of his career-high five goals nearly a minute into the game off a pass from freshman attack Jeff Cohen.Presbyterian also came out of the gates with energy and tied the game at one about three minutes into the first quarter. Cohen regained the edge for the Crimson at about the 12 minute mark and then assisted Gibbons’ second goal to provide a spark for nine unanswered Harvard goals en route to a 10-2 halftime lead.“We took the same approach in this game as we have in every game,” Cohen said. “We’ve been a little up and down in games lately, so we tried to use this game to create a little more consistency. Overall we’re not trying to worry about who we’re playing but rather just playing the same way each game.”Sophomore attack Matt Hull created some energy by scoring two goals within 30 seconds in the second quarter. Hull, who had scored three goals in his career entering the game, completed a hat trick with an unassisted goal at the end of the third quarter to extend the lead to 14-2. Hull also added three assists to match Gibbons with a game-high six points. “I was pleased with the way guys responded, given that we had a quick turnaround after a disappointing and hard-fought game against Georgetown,” Crimson coach John Tillman said.Despite concerns that his squad was drained physically, Tillman stressed the importance of gaining an early advantage.“In college lacrosse you can see that one team can come through in a game just because they are more motivated,” he said. “We didn’t want them to get motivated, and we have worked so hard all year we didn’t want to get caught off-guard.”Harvard shut out the Blue Hose in the second half as senior Joe Pike picked up his fourth win of the season along with four saves. Freshman Christian Coates came in for Pike at the end of the third quarter and allowed zero goals while stopping four shots. Junior Sam Michel finished the game at goalie for the Crimson and grabbed one save, pushing the group total to nine. The goalies’ effort was tied for the best by the Crimson in over a year—since an 11-2 victory at Hartford on March 11, 2008.  Harvard held a 34-14 shot advantage and grabbed 44 ground balls, led by sophomore midfielder Andrew Parchman, who claimed six. “I was really proud of the way the guys competed today,” Tillman said. “We all felt the disappointment from the loss [against the Hoyas], but I was proud of how they picked themselves up and went out and grabbed this win.” Playing in an area where lacrosse is still small but rapidly expanding, members of the Crimson stayed after the game to lead some skills sessions and talk to some of the Atlanta-based youth who were in attendance. In an informal gathering, local athletes enjoyed the opportunity to shoot on Harvard’s goalies and throw around.“The game is growing all over the country, and we saw a great opportunity to bring our program to an area where lacrosse is growing,” Tillman said. “We definitely take it as our responsibility to also promote the game and do things the right way. I was really pleased with how our [team] stayed after the game to meet with the kids. It was a really cool thing for us to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There are only two things a track team can do when visiting Texas: go to a rodeo and race. And while members of the Harvard track and field team dubbed the rodeo “cool,” the most excitement came from racing, where both the men’s and women’s teams enjoyed powerful performances at the TSU Relays at Texas State University and the 27th Annual Victor Lopez Bayou Classic at Rice University.“Overall it was a great trip,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “We brought a pretty large contingent down to Texas. We had a number of athletes who were event winners and who qualified for regionals. As a group, we took another step with this trip, and we are just really excited to get the [spring] season underway.”BAYOU CLASSICAt the Bayou Classic this past weekend, the Crimson faced teams from around Texas and from across the nation, including powerhouses Rice University, Jackson State, Michigan and Texas Tech. Despite the unfamiliar competition, both the men’s and women’s teams continued to perform well.On the women’s side, sophomore Jamie Olson received a silver medal in the 800-meter run with a time of 2:14.67, just half a second behind first place finisher Keltie John from Rice and only one second ahead of Crimson freshman Meghan Looney, who placed fourth.Other highlights included seniors Geneva Trotter and Dara Wilson’s fourth- and fifth- place finishes in the 100-meter hurdles.The field part of Harvard’s contingency had its own success, with sophomore Jessica Fronk placing first in the javelin throw and senior Evan Favermann coming in third.Co-captain Becky Christensen also had success, winning the high jump event with a height of 5’10.On the men’s side, freshman John Dingus sat 0.2 seconds out of third place in the 400-meter dash, while sophomore Brian Hill won gold in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:54.33.Freshman Nico Weiler and sophomore Sean Gil took first and third, respectively, in the pole vault, with Weiler clearing a height of 17’. Junior Jack Brady received a bronze medal in the shot put with a throw of 51’1.5, while freshman Nick Farnsworth took gold with a javelin throw of 201’ in the last event of field competition.“Overall this trip was a success particularly when compared to the previous years,” Saretsky said. “The team was much more competitive and it’s shaping up to be a good season for us.”TSU RELAYSA week earlier, at the Texas State University Relays, both the men’s and women’s teams started off the break ready to impress despite the windy weather.“One of the things with this trip was that weather was an adjustment, going from indoors to outdoors, but the team did a good job,” Saretsky said. “The assumption is that if you go down to Texas the weather will be warm, but it was actually cold and windy.”“I think a lot of people had a chance to get ready for the outside season,” Christensen said. “[The wind] made it hard for anyone who had long races, but I guess it made it better for our training. [Regardless of the conditions] I think everyone at least had a really strong start to the season, and some people were able to compete for the first time, since their events cannot be done indoors.”Christensen again placed first in the high jump with a height of 5’10. Harvard also claimed third in the pole vault with freshman Stacey Jung clearing 10’8. In the javelin throw, Fronk placed first, followed by Favermann, with distances of 142’7 and 126’1 respectively.Strong performances also came from Harvard’s runners, including sophomore Meghan Houser, who placed third in the 3000-meter run with a time of 10:48. The 4x400-meter relay team, consisting of sophomore Katrina Drayton and freshmen Shannon Conway, Magda Robak, and Lauren Leon, grabbed another bronze for Harvard. Conway, Leon, senior Fa         via Meritt and sophomore Thea Lee also won a silver medal for the Crimson in the 1600-meter sprint medley with a time of 4:01.97.For the men’s team, sophomore Ryan Neely placed third in the 3000-meter run, while the Harvard distance medley team of juniors Vito Cannavo and Robert Kenney, and freshmen Jaques Barjon and Darcy Wilson, claimed gold.In the last events of the day, Weiler placed second in the pole vault and Farnsworth placed third in the javelin throw. Senior Neville Irani and sophomore Eric Clayman also claimed the top two positions in the hammer throw to close out a successful week.

Hello comrades,
We at FlyBy missed your shining intellects, your illuminating comments on this here Web-thingie, and your blinding, Widener-induced pallors on campus. But we're sure that spring break has changed some things. A more rotund beer belly perhaps? Maybe that new stripper girlfriend? An unacceptable tan? Or, if you're like us, a newfound appreciation for wearing Snuggies while wallowing in a deep, deep vegetative state. Whatever your spring break style was, no problem—we're an all-inclusive family, and we welcome you all back.
But you probably missed some things, which you can familiarize yourself with after the jump.

Shame on you, Cambridge. How could you, famished ingrates?
Yes, we see those salty traces lacing your mouths. No, don't try to wipe them away now. The deed's been done—your immoral choices have had severe repercussions for the great national institution of Subway.
Last week, the fairly new sandwich venue in the Garage moved its rolling shelf of chips from the hall to behind the counter. Supposedly, too many hoodlums have been snatching bags of chips and running away.
The snack that drove most of the nascent criminal tendencies haywire? Doritos, the man behind the cash register at Subways confirmed.
We expected better of you, young violators of the law. Not because you stole a bag of chips, but because you stole a bag of chips. Next time you plan on pulling a badass move, try stealing something a bit more filling—maybe a nice slab of porterhouse steak or at least a foot-long (okay fine: a six-inch, for the faint of heart).
You didn't even do it with style, like this feathery fellow.
