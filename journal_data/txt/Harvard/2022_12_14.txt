Daft Punk’s “Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem“ (2003) is an ode to the visual album. Using 14 music videos from their album “Discovery“ (2001), the project comes together to create a masterpiece of a film. The film is a refreshing reminder of what can happen when artists have the freedom to take risks and collaborate. “Interstella 5555“ is a colorful amalgamation of different art mediums that manages to highlight the strengths of both the musical and visual artists. As a result, the film becomes a masterclass in storytelling, as it manages to convey an allegory for the exploitation of artists in the music industry without dialogue.
The film begins with visuals of an otherworldly universe as the music slowly picks up in the background. The camera pans down to the horizon of a planet before a blue face sings, “One more time!” The source of this music is soon revealed — a stadium that resembles a UFO, containing the band and four main characters: a drummer named Baryl, a guitarist named Apregius, the bassist, Stella, and the keyboard player/lead singer Octave. The concert in front of thousands of aliens doesn’t last long, as the dance song comes to a halt when eight bells sound — and give way to an electronic rock guitar, marking the transition to track two, “Aerodynamic.” The accompanying visuals are just as gripping, as men in armor and masks chase after the band. They capture all four members, and one final bell sounds, as the hero of the story, Shep, is alerted of the band’s kidnapping, leading into “Digital Love.”
Daft Punk and their supervising director, legendary manga and anime creator Leiji Matsumoto, pay special attention to the intros, outros, and transitions of and between songs, and many of the videos end in cliffhangers. The cut to Shep’s crashed spaceship at the end of “Digital Love” sets up his rescue mission story arc, leading into “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.” During this song, the band members are stripped of their clothes and color and turned into people with completely new identities. The mastermind behind all of this planned on making them into a globally successful band, The Crescendolls. But the sight of Shep represented the glimmer of hope that the aliens would make it back to their planet. The intro to the next song, “Crescendolls” sets the tone for their inevitable worldwide success. They board a private jet and arrive in a city in a stretch limousine with “The Crescendolls” on the license plate.
“Interstella 5555“ showcases a range of complex emotions throughout its 68 minute runtime. “Digital Love,” is an upbeat electronic pop love song that Shep sings about Stella before he knows that the band has been taken. He has a dream about her that takes place in a colorful dreamworld that he revisits, with her, in the film’s other love song, “Something About Us.” But “Something About Us” is an unbelievably intimate song about fleeting love. “It might not be the right time,” Shep sings to Stella. He had been waiting for a moment with her for the entire film, and it finally materialized in this bittersweet moment. “Nightvision” follows “Crescendolls,” and the contrast in tone between the two songs, coupled with the pacing of “Nightvision” makes it clear how mentally and physically drained the band members are due to them being overworked.
In the film, the music does what dialogue doesn’t, or rather, couldn’t. In “Aerodynamic,” as the guitarist runs away from the men, he holds his instrument by his side as a shredding guitar solo plays in the background. The disco-influenced track, “High Life,” captures the glamorous feel of stardom with its big city visuals and high profile people.
The animators also used weather to bring out the vibe of certain songs. The video for “Nightvision,” the busiest song featured, takes place on a rainy night. The scene of Stella looking out the window longingly, not knowing that Shep is out there looking for them stands out in particular. The video for “Veridis quo,” the most revelatory video of the film, features a snowstorm on the drive to Darkwood Manor — a house straight out of a gothic novel — one of the many examples of the environment mimicking the music and the mood.
This visual album is a fun and re-watchable gem that is underappreciated compared to its accompanying album “Discovery”. Daft Punk and Leiji Matsumoto crafted one of the most beautiful stories of the early 2000s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“The 12th Commandment,” the latest offering by creative writing professor and acclaimed author Daniel Torday, follows a Brooklyn-based magazine editor, Zeke, as he travels to his rural college town of Mt. Izmir, Ohio, for the funeral of a friend. There, he finds a scandal fit for a magazine: Natan of Flatbush, the leader and purported prophet of a local Dönme community — a little-known Jewish-Muslim religious sect — was recently convicted of murdering his own teenaged son, Osman. To make matters even more interesting, Zeke’s ex-girlfriend, Johanna, was the prosecutor on the case.
The Dönme, described as a cult-like, heavily armed group with ancient roots, followed Natan some years ago from New York to Central Ohio to make a home for themselves in “the Caves,” their community’s secretive and sacred compound.
The book gets its name from the twelfth of the eighteen Dönme commandments, which decrees that it is not a sin in the eyes of God to kill one who has revealed Dönme secrets to the outside world. Johanna and the rest of the outside world believe that Natan killed Osman for doing exactly that, but Natan and his congregation insist on his innocence.
Unfortunately, the book’s promising premise — which bears some resemblance to Gillian Flynn’s 2006 novel, “Sharp Objects,” and America’s plethora of non-fiction homicidal cult leaders — loses all intrigue upon execution. The final product suffers from tired character archetypes, overambitious storytelling, and long-winded pacing that makes it impossible for the book to find a place among any genre’s contemporary greats.
The novel’s greatest strength — its obvious anthropological bent — is too often misused to remedy the above deficiencies. Zeke’s fascination with the Dönmes and his journalistic prowess are qualities often told yet little shown, and the reader must wade through nearly 300 pages of text only to leave without much of a picture of the ins and outs of the Dönme community. No time is spared to outline the sect’s real-world Ottoman Empire roots, either, and some of their mentioned practices and beliefs, like prayer to 17th-century Kabbalistic messiah Shabbetai Tzevi, go unexplained, leaving uninformed readers in the dark.
Instead, the reader faces pages upon pages of pseudo-anthropological writing dedicated to thick description of the Central Ohio landscape and Zeke’s quotidian existence. The choppily written narration exactingly details Zeke’s many shufflings to and from his Airbnb, the Dönme Caves, and Johanna’s apartment in varying states of intoxication, dressing and undressing, as well as sending Slack messages to his boss and taking afternoon naps.
Zeke’s frequent injuries and penchant for avoiding problems humanize him as a protagonist and would make him a sufficiently interesting object of study in a different literary context. He is cut from the cloth of clumsy and artistic New York millennials, and in many ways it is a relief that there is an omniscient narrator available to fill the audience in on some of the Dönmes’ practices that Zeke himself misses.
Alongside Zeke is the wholly unoriginal character of Johanna. Described in the opening chapter as the kind of girl in college who could ace an early morning exam even after a night of excessive drinking and little sleep, the book plays heavy-handedly into that exhausted literary trope until the very end. Every third word the character utters is a creatively constructed compound adjective intended to hurt Zeke’s feelings or poignantly deliver some point about the virtues of the American legal system and Aristotelian ethics; she reads like an aged version of Veronica Lodge from The CW’s “Riverdale.” The serious-but-sexy, emotionally unavailable, sarcastic female love interest has been done much better many times before, and its intrusion here feels like a failed attempt at infusing slow-burn romance into a novel that, if treated properly, should have been able to hold its own without it.
To be clear, Torday’s decision to write about the Dönme at all deserves praise. Their placement in this work of fiction effectively sheds light on a very real and historically misunderstood religious group that lives on in small numbers in modern-day Turkey. As the story unfolds, though, it seems as though this inclusion wasn’t especially intentional. Because so little explanation of Dönme beliefs and their distinguishing characteristics can be found in the story, a reader looking to better understand the group through the book would be better off directing their attention elsewhere.
Overall, “The 12th Commandment” is a disappointing and forgettable read with few distinguished features that merit selecting it over any other new work of fiction. The ending doesn’t bring much closure to the issue of Osman’s murder, and the weaving of different genres — from mystery to romance to slice-of-life — means that a reader searching for one in particular will not get enough of it to leave satisfied.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly three years and millions of deaths later, polities across the globe are still wrestling with the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. But if most of the world appears eager to hastily move on from the “after times” so as to get to a new “before” era — to remove masks, enjoy global sporting events, and find a balance between epidemic preparedness and normalcy — one country has been insistent on doing the exact opposite.
Meet China’s controversial “zero covid” policy, a set of stringent city-wide lockdowns, forced quarantines, and mass testing meant to keep the country’s infections as low as possible against a mandate-less domestic backdrop defined by low vaccination and herd immunity rates. The government’s commitment to minimizing cases of a disease that’s arguably on track to become endemic, particularly in its sometimes draconian application of restrictions, has left behind a smattering of tragic stories: a bus on its way to compulsive quarantine that crashed, killing 27; residents urged to remain inside buildings during earthquakes; ethnic minorities in border regions, already antagonized by the regime, who faced alleged food shortages; residents of locked-down cities who reported orders to adhere to protocol and stay inside even as a massive earthquake unfolded.
“Zero covid” meant zero room for error — at any cost, including popular upset.
But no controversy or weeks-long lockdown sparked quite the same backlash, the same productive anger and revolt, as a deadly fire in an apartment complex in Urumqi this  November.  Those 10 deaths — coming on top of months’ worth of budding resentment against the harsh policies, made more bitter by footage presuming to show how “zero covid” measures hampered rescue efforts — proved 10 too many. The fire soon sparked protests, first in Urumqi and then, like a silent but swelling wave, across the country, even prompting (in a sharply unusual show of popular opposition) chants against the Chinese Communist Party itself.
Soon enough — like many other broadspread, laudable protest movements — the chants for change had reached our little corner of Cambridge too.
Hundreds, many of them Harvard affiliates, congregated in Harvard Yard to show solidarity with the protest efforts in China. They chanted “Free China,” “No more lockdowns,” and “Hey hey, ho ho! ‘Zero Covid’ must go!”, sang “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from “Les Misérables,” and covered their faces with sheets of white paper to show support for protestors in China.
The protesters expressed brave, ardent support for their counterparts within China. As a board, we can’t help but follow their footsteps: We stand with those willing to speak up against Xi and against autocracies (as well as with their right to define and lead their own struggle), and mourn the senseless loss of life and erosion of basic liberties in Urumqi and across the country.  From strict, isolating lockdowns with no end date in sight to outright government censorship of the policies’ effects, it is more than clear that Zero Covid has been repressive in effect.
We extend our support and solidarity to Chinese international students and, more broadly, to all those hailing from countries with poor track records for human rights and civil liberties who feel trapped between expressing opposition from abroad and harming those left behind. University students in particular are, and historically have been, at the heart of dissent in China. The white paper sheet protest tactic began with them; these protests began with them.
The world, their compatriots, and any defender of democracy’s core freedoms owe them admiration and gratitude. Harvard, as a powerful lobbying and educational institution, owes them (particularly its current, impacted affiliates) boundless generosity in assisting with any and all upcoming challenges, from financing their education to limiting immigration hurdles. Let autocrats know that any and all brilliant minds willing to defy a descent into dystopia will get nothing short of unconditional support from the elite institutions they so seem to admire.
Our endorsement of these core liberties, and of those who fight tirelessly and at great personal cost for them, can not be limited by a particular geographic scope; our opinions must demand consistent standards from Boston to Beijing. We support the right of Chinese people, and all people, to advocate for basic human rights, including the freedom to voice dissent unapologetically and publicly. We believe, furthermore, that out of all forms of governance democracy best lends itself towards the pursuit, maintenance, and defense of these rights.
Those lucky enough to live within systems that tolerate opposition, those hailing (or, in our case, opining) from the relative security of democratic countries, should, first, seek to perfect their own abundant domestic shortcomings. No nation is free from ongoing sin — but only democratic ones offer a path, through unbridled critique and debate, through progress and setbacks, to beginning to heal them.
Non-Chinese spectators should also closely follow and support allied international struggles. In that vein, we endorse the multiple other movements seeking greater liberties across China, including the struggles of lonesome, democratic Taiwan, the fight against annihilation and repression of the Uyghur people, the resolute defiance of the untamable Hong Kong, and those sounding Tibet’s decades-long cry for help. While we lack the space or time to fully and nuancedly unpack their collective history and merits with the care they deserve, we are convinced of the sincere desire for autonomy and freedom behind their claims.
The outburst after Urumqi has already triggered an overhaul of China’s covid policy, a rare concession to popular will. It might not be the last. We would like to believe that Urumqi and its backlash, along with a host of other indicators from Tehran to Kiev, represent a seemingly broad tide towards democracy, a hint that Francis Fukuyama might just have been right. Faint but inspiring proof that, in the scholar’s own words, “no authoritarian government presents a society that is, in the long term, more attractive than liberal democracy, and could therefore be considered the goal or end point of historical progress.”
A future that begins not with a boot forever stamping on a human face — but with a protest, a vote, or a whisper that asks, in brave, unflinching terms, whether you hear the people sing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College students Grace R. Kim ’23, Kavya M. Shah ’23, and Aristotle Vainikos ’23 were tapped as Marshall Scholars, the British government announced Monday.
The three are part of a cohort of 40 students selected from a total applicant pool of 951, according to a press release. The prestigious scholarship, established in 1953 by the British government, finances postgraduate study at any British university for American citizens.
Harvard produced the most Marshall Scholars this year, tying with Yale and the University of Pennsylvania. Kim, Shah, and Vainikos bring the College’s total number of Marshall Scholars up to 259, more than any other university — Princeton comes in second with 139.
Shah, a Chemical and Physical Biology concentrator in Lowell House and a former Crimson news editor, was sitting in Cabot library when he got the call, initially mistaking it for spam before checking the caller ID.
“Because I was on the second floor of Cabot, it was supposed to be a quiet spot, so I ran to the bathroom and then called them back,” Shah said. “I kind of had a bit of a freakout session in the bathroom, so that was fun.”
Though applicants were notified shortly after their interview, they were instructed to keep their award secret until Monday and were only allowed to tell their families in the interim.
Vainikos, a Government concentrator in Leverett House, said his first call went to his grandfather.
“He was very pleased. I can’t remember exactly what he said, but I'm sure it was something encouraging in Greek,” he said. “And then I called my mom.”
Kim, who lives in Kirkland House and concentrates in Engineering Sciences, says she also called her family after finding out.
“When they first heard they were like, ‘Oh my gosh, you’re really going to the UK!'" she said.
The application process began in the late spring and early summer for the scholars, who first had to receive Harvard’s endorsement to apply. The scholarship notified shortlisted candidates in October and held interviews in November.
The awardees said the application process helped them better understand their own academic interests.
Kim, whose work has focused on aerospace engineering and social impact, said the application helped her understand “how to actually support these communities through space.”
Vainikos said the process allowed him to better articulate his passions.
“It was useful in an intellectual sense, forcing me to put my thoughts together on what I like to learn and how to articulate the things that were interesting to me,” he said.
The three are in the process of applying to their universities of choice and hope to begin their studies in the UK this fall. The Marshall Scholarship does not guarantee admission to any British university and only finances the education.
Outside of the classroom, the scholars said they look forward to their time abroad.
“I'm a big fan of different kinds of architecture and sightseeing, different buildings,” Shah said. “​​I'm really excited to travel around the United Kingdom and honestly in other parts of Europe as well and just visit different kinds of buildings, different architectures.”

Raising blank sheets of white paper, about a dozen people gathered in Harvard Square's Pit by the T station entrance Tuesday afternoon in solidarity with Chinese demonstrators protesting censorship and the country’s Covid-19 restrictions.
The demonstration follows a wave of protests across China against the country’s “Zero-Covid” policy after an apartment fire killed 10 people on Nov. 24. The fire occurred in Urumqi, the capital of China’s Xinjiang region, where strict Covid-19 lockdowns have confined residents to their homes for several months.
Tuesday’s demonstrators raised blank white sheets of paper to protest China’s crackdown on free speech and honor the country’s blank paper protests.
Artist Yolanda He Yang, who organized the demonstration alongside the Harvard Square Business Association, performed in the Pit, alongside Boston University undergraduates Rachel Kanter and Rowan J. Benz and MIT graduate student and violinist Brabeeba M. Wang ’18.
During the performance, Yang, Kanter, and Benz held paper-sized rectangles of clear glass over their heads. Using a white paint marker, they wrote “You know what I want to say” in both English and Mandarin repeatedly until the glass was covered in white — mimicking a blank sheet of paper.
Yang said the art demonstration had a clear purpose: “to bring awareness of the basic human rights to speak freely — to have free speech.”
Yang, who is from mainland China, has been unable to return home in recent years due to the pandemic. As protests have erupted in China in recent weeks, she said she has grown increasingly concerned for her family and felt a sense of solidarity with the protesters.
“It was very frustrating to see and to read articles about people forced to stay at home, being very hopeless,” Yang said.
“The inspiration actually was coming from [a] very emotional, very personal impulse of ‘I want to support and I wish I could be there with all the Chinese individual[s], because I’m Chinese too,’” she added. “I’m so far, I am here, and I always feel guilty to be here because it seems like we’re safe right now.”
Yang said she hopes to instill a sense of solidarity in others, too, through the public art demonstration.
“What I am trying to do as an artist is to nurture the sensitivity within people’s body, heart, mind,” she said. “So you wouldn’t feel ‘Oh, that’s not my business,’ and walk away.”
Still, Yang expressed concerns about the potential repercussions of the event.
“I was very concerned before the performance and I am still concerned after [the] performance, because the censorship is not a joke,” she said.
“I actually had a very serious talk with my friend,” she added. “They said, ‘Yolanda, I think you should wear sunglasses, and I think you should wear [a] mask.’”
Yang opted not to conceal herself during the demonstration.
Wang composed a piece on his violin to accompany the art performance. He said he chose a minimalistic approach to mirror the artists’ hand movements. The piece contained only two notes in different patterns and styles.
“The idea of having two notes is with two notes only, you theoretically could represent any kind of language — just like one and zero,” he said. “Other kinds of notes [are] censored out by the government but even under censorship, you still can have freedom to express yourself.”
Yang reached out to Wang after he performed with blank paper protesters in Harvard Yard on Nov. 29. The pair held their first blank paper art demonstration in Times Square on Saturday.
Benz and Kanter said they hope the Harvard Square demonstration will draw attention to the issue of censorship in China.
“I hope that for people that maybe are unfamiliar with it, this could be like a starting point to learning more about what’s happening,” Kanter said.
“I think that people in the U.S. take our freedom of speech for granted,” Benz added. “In the U.S., we have the privilege of being able to speak up to the government. But elsewhere, it is very, very dangerous to do so.”

Harvard University and its police officers’ union agreed to a new contract after nearly two years of negotiations, police chief Victor A. Clay said in an interview Tuesday.
The previous contract expired in November 2020, and the new deal marks the first collective bargaining agreement for officers under Clay’s tenure. In April, the Harvard University Police Association and the University began meeting with a federal mediator to discuss contract negotiations.
HUPA President Michael A. Arsenault wrote in a statement that the HUPA ratified the contract during a meeting in June following 18 months of negotiation with the University.
Clay said in the interview that he felt officers’ spirits had improved in light of the new contract.
“Morale has gone up since the signing,” Clay said. “They received what I think is a fair contract.”
Clay also discussed delays to his plans for reform in the department, though he touted new hiring initiatives and advancement opportunities within HUPD.
During Clay’s first year as chief, the department saw a series of changes in its leadership, including the promotion of four captains and a reshuffled “command staff.” Clay said in the interview that his focus has been creating an “effective leadership team.”
Clay’s appointment to lead HUPD came just over a year after an investigation by The Crimson detailing a culture of racism and sexism under then-Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley rocked the department.
Riley stepped down at the end of 2020, though some members of his leadership team remained early into Clay’s tenure, including longtime second-in-command Kevin W. Regan, who left the department in February.
Clay said HUPD is undergoing a “change process,” adding that he hopes to move on from the department’s past and heal its scars.
“My intent is to be better, not to be punitive,” Clay said. “I’ve been here for 17 months, and it’s time for us to move forward.”
Clay said the department continued recruitment efforts and staff changes in recent months, including promoting three lieutenants and launching a process to recruit new sergeants.
“I want to be the best. I expect my officers to be the best. I expect us to deliver the best service to our community,” Clay said.
Clay said he is “torn” on whether to implement body cameras for officers, citing concerns about their impact on student privacy.
“I haven’t really even brought it up with anyone, because we go into residential spaces,” Clay said. “I'm afraid that it would be more intrusive than it would be helpful.”
Clay said he does not oppose the use of body cameras, saying they “worked well in the field” earlier in his career, but he said he would like to hear from Harvard affiliates before deciding to use them on campus.
In an interview in May, Clay said he planned to establish five new unarmed Campus Support Officer positions by fall 2022. Since then, the proposal has been delayed by administrative processes, Clay said, with his proposed job description for the role currently under review by Harvard Human Resources.
“Although the wheels of justice spin slowly, the wheels of bureaucracy are even slower,” Clay said. “We’re going to work through it and try to get it rolling in the spring.”
Clay said a planned update to HUPD’s workload and crime dashboard — a proposal shaped by the department’s advisory board — has also taken longer than expected while the department has been “beta testing” it, though he hopes to release the information this spring.
“There’s Harvard time, right?” Clay said. “We showed the dashboard or a preliminary view to the advisory board, and we’re getting input to make sure that the information is relevant.”
The dashboard debuted in June 2021, revealing that HUPD had arrested Black people at a disproportionate rate across the prior three years. The dashboard stemmed from a recommendation put forth by a 2020 external review into the department.
In August, the department hired its newest employee — Sasha, a black labrador retriever who serves as HUPD’s Community Engagement Dog. Handled by HUPD officer Steve Fumicello, Sasha’s role is to comfort and support students, faculty, and staff at Harvard.
Sasha graduated from Puppies Behind Bars, a program that trains incarcerated people to raise dogs for war veterans, first responders, and police departments.
“I'm a dog lover, so I'm all for it,” Clay said. “When Steve brought that program to me, I thought, ‘Outstanding, let's do it.’”
Clay said he plans to continue evaluating the department and making improvements where needed.
“I'm not going to stop moving forward. I'm not going to stop assessing. I'm not going to stop making sure that our processes are the best,” Clay said.

Outgoing University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in an interview Tuesday his successor will likely appoint the new deans for the Harvard Divinity School and the School of Public Health.
Both David N. Hempton, dean of the Divinity School, and Michelle A. Williams, dean of the School of Public Health, announced this fall that they plan to step down at the end of the academic year. Bacow said whether the incoming 30th president fills the vacancies depends on when his successor is announced and how far along the searches for new deans are.
“I’d be surprised if they’re completed by the time the new president is named, just given where we started, how long it takes to fill one of these jobs,” Bacow said.
Bacow inherited three dean vacancies from then-University President Drew G. Faust. Though two of the searches were already “close to the end” before Bacow was selected in February 2018, Bacow made all three appointments.
“At that point, I took them over because Drew said, ‘Look, these are going to be your deans. You should make the decision,’” he said.
Harvard’s administration is experiencing rapid turnover as many long-standing officials retire. In addition to the two deans and Bacow himself, several members of Harvard’s top brass have stepped down from their posts or announced their departures in the last year: the executive director of the Harvard Alumni Association, the chief financial officer, the executive vice president, and the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing board. The school is still searching for a new CFO.
Still, Bacow said he isn’t worried about the overlapping transitions because the University has “known of virtually all of those [departures] well in advance.”
“Each of those positions are people, basically, who are retiring — long-scheduled, serious retirements,” Bacow said. “If you look at their age, none of it is surprising.”
He added the University has “tried to make sure that we at least have some good internal options” for any vacancies, but that external candidates are not ruled out either.
Bacow also discussed the following topics:
While Bacow does not sit on the 15-member search committee for the 30th president, he confirmed the body met Dec. 5 at Loeb House.
Since 1991, every Harvard president has had a Ph.D. and a Harvard diploma. But Bacow said he does not think it is “absolutely necessary” for his successor to be a Harvard graduate or have a Ph.D. so long as they “adapt to the circumstances that they find themselves in” and are “a scholar of sufficient prominence” to earn the respect of the faculty.
“It’s, I think, helpful to have some administrative experience,” he said. “This is a very large and complicated organization.”
In recent months, some affiliates have taken aim at what they describe as Harvard’s bloated bureaucracy, suggesting that the school should slash significant portions of its administrative ranks. Today, Harvard employs 7,024 total full-time administrators.
Bacow defended the size of the University’s bureaucracy in Tuesday’s interview, saying that major projects require new personnel to ensure successful execution.
He created vice provost positions for climate and sustainability projects and the implementation of legacy of slavery initiatives.
“I don’t consider that expanding the bureaucracy,” Bacow said. “I consider that, ‘How do we see that a major initiative fulfills its mission?’ So I really don’t think we’ve expanded the bureaucracy on my watch.”
Still, Bacow acknowledged that Harvard has added more administrative staff for research support, cyber security, helping the University meet federal reporting standards, and the school’s mental health and Title IX resources.
“It’s not as if we added people just to add people,” Bacow said, saying new staff members help the University carry out its mission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A student was arrested outside Currier House last month after he allegedly assaulted police officers and threatened a school shooting at Harvard.
Julian J. Dixon ’22, a student on a leave of absence, told officers he would come back and “shoot up this school” after he was detained for threatening a Securitas guard during the early morning of Nov. 2, according to a Harvard University Police Department report.
Dixon faces seven charges, including assault and battery on a police officer and resisting arrest.
Upon arrest, officers found no weapons in Dixon’s possession, according to the police report. HUPD Detective Robert Surette was listed as the arresting officer.
Dixon pleaded not guilty on all counts. His attorney, Greg L. Johnson, declined to comment on his behalf.
Dixon, who told officers he had drunk three mojitos before coming to Currier House, attempted to punch and kick HUPD officers as they tried to arrest him, according to the report. At one point, Dixon broke free from the officers’ hold and ran into the street before he was again apprehended, the report said.
Dixon shouted racist slurs at two HUPD officers and spat at one of them, according to the police report.
The altercation began after Dixon was prevented from entering Currier House, his former residence, by a Securitas guard at around 1 a.m., the police report said. Dixon refused to identify himself and tried to walk past the guard, who said he would call the police if Dixon didn’t leave, according to the police report.
The guard called HUPD after Dixon refused, the police report said, before Dixon backed the guard into the corner of the security office, threatening to kill him and the members of Harvard’s administrative board.
Currier House Faculty Deans Latanya A. Sweeney and Sylvia I. Barrett wrote an email to students three days after the arrest citing the trespassing attempt and cautioning students to be vigilant, keep their doors locked, and to not allow others to “piggyback” when they swipe into the building.
“If we all act responsibly and maintain our vigilance, we will continue to have a home environment we all enjoy,” the deans wrote.
The Currier House deans held a conversation with residents on Nov. 6 to invite students to propose and discuss new safety measures and best practices for personal safety.
Following the incident, Harvard increased security measures at Currier, including adding two around-the-clock Securitas guards and stationing an HUPD car outside the building entrance.
The deans wrote in a follow-up email that Dixon, who they did not identify by name, was “no longer in the state,” but recommended continued caution because of the threat.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment on the incident, citing a longstanding department policy to refrain from speaking about pending cases.
HUPD rarely makes arrests. According to the department’s annual security report, officers arrested only four people in 2021.
Dixon is scheduled for a virtual pre-trial hearing on Wednesday.

Harvard Holds Inaugural Affinity Celebration for Graduates with Disabilities
BOSTON — The former captain of Harvard’s fencing team told a federal jury on Tuesday that the sons of Jie “Jack” Zhao, who is accused of paying bribes to get his children into the College as fencing recruits, were talented athletes who were qualified to be on the team.
Geoffrey Tourette ’21, who captained Harvard’s fencing team from 2019 to 2021, said Eric Y. Zhao ’18 was a “terrific leader” and called Edward Y. Zhao ’21 “one of the most committed” fencers on the team who made a “huge positive impact.”
Jack Zhao is facing trial alongside former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand, who prosecutors say accepted more than $1.5 million in bribes as part of a scheme to get Zhao’s kids into the College.
The government rested its case Tuesday afternoon after calling 14 witnesses across the first five-and-a-half days of trial.
As defense attorneys for Brand and Zhao began presenting their case, they sought to show that Zhao’s sons were admitted based on athletic and academic merit.
Zhao’s attorney, Michael T. C. Packard ’02, said government prosecutors went to “great lengths” to “attack” the fencing skills of Edward Zhao, who a government witness testified last week was “not as good” as the other four Harvard fencers at his position.
As Packard spoke, Brand — who has maintained an impassive demeanor throughout the trial — began nodding firmly.
Tourette said Tuesday that Edward Zhao, his close friend and former roommate, had potential to be a top performer on the team, but was set back by a 2019 Boston Globe article that raised questions about the relationship between Brand and his father.
Tourette said Edward Zhao was “shaken up” and could not perform at his best following the publication of the Globe story.
The article “impacted his mental state very negatively,” Tourette said, speaking so quickly that a court stenographer twice asked him to slow down.
Prosecutors allege Zhao paid an array of direct and indirect bribes to Brand, including paying off several loans, covering his son’s college tuition, and buying the former coach’s house at a dramatically inflated price.
Proceedings on Tuesday were stalled for a nearly hourlong recess as Judge George A. O’Toole Jr. deliberated whether to permit examples of Zhao loaning money to others throughout his life as evidence. O’Toole ultimately moved to permit the evidence, but it was not presented on Tuesday.
“Mr. Zhao has twice before made six-figure loans, just as he did here,” Packard told the judge, referring to the payments to Brand.
Defense attorneys said during opening arguments that Zhao’s direct payments to Brand were loans that were repaid in full with interest, though they have yet to present evidence of any repayments. Last week, prosecutors filed a motion to exclude any evidence of a “purported loan agreement or purported post-indictment payments from Brand to Zhao,” saying the deadline for discovery had passed.
Jurors also heard on Tuesday from Joshua Miller, a Boston Globe editor who authored the newspaper’s 2019 investigation into Zhao’s purchase of Brand’s home in Needham, Massachusetts. The Globe challenged a subpoena that ordered Miller to testify, but the judge, O’Toole, ruled he would have to appear.
Other government witnesses on Tuesday included Brand’s next-door neighbor in Needham, a real estate agent who helped Zhao resell Brand’s former home, an IRS investigator, and an auditor with the U.S. District Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts.
The trial is set to resume at 9 a.m. Wednesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seven months after Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced the school was recruiting two senior professors studying climate change and sustainability, HKS is still trying to bring them to Cambridge.
Elmendorf said in an interview Monday that the Kennedy School still has “two offers out to senior faculty members.”
“They are still trying to decide what to do,” Elmendorf said. “We’re working very hard to try to make this their best choice, but I don’t know where those stand yet.”
The Kennedy School’s efforts to hire faculty with a focus on climate change and sustainability come at a time when Harvard and its peer institutions are dedicating more resources toward studying the climate crisis.
Harvard announced in June that it received a $200 million donation to establish the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences also announced a cluster hire of up to three senior faculty members in climate, sustainability, and the environment.
Harvard’s efforts follow major commitments to the study of climate change at peer institutions. In July 2020, Columbia University founded a new school dedicated to studying climate change, and in May 2022, Stanford University announced that it would establish a new school of sustainability with the help of a $1.1 billion donation.
The Kennedy School had more luck in hiring a new faculty member studying the rise of China. The school successfully recruited Rana Mitter, a professor at Oxford University who focuses on the history and politics of modern China, according to Elmendorf.
Elmendorf said that Mitter, who previously studied at Harvard as a Kennedy Scholar, will join HKS in the summer.
“He’s an expert on modern Chinese history — so say the history of China since the Second World War,” Elmendorf said, adding Mitter “advises the British government on policy toward China.”
“I hope over time we can hire more people who are experts on some aspect of the rise of China, given its huge importance for international relations and security and the economy,” Elmendorf added. “But the one person we’ve made the offer to has accepted — that's good.”
Elmendorf also said the Kennedy School is currently recruiting scholars focused on city-level policy issues, following a $150 million donation from Bloomberg Philanthropies in 2021 to establish the Harvard-wide Bloomberg Center for Cities.
The Kennedy School is also looking to hire faculty members studying technology and public policy, according to Elmendorf.
“We know we need to do more,” he said. “I think we will launch other searches in technology and public policy, but we haven’t started that process yet.”
During the interview, Elmendorf also addressed open director positions at the Institute of Politics and the Belfer Center. Ashton B. Carter, the former Belfer Center director, died suddenly of a heart attack in October. Eric B. Rosenbach, who serves as co-director of the Belfer Center, has led the center in the interim since Carter’s death.
“The Belfer Center has long been an especially important part of the Kennedy School because of the way it has drawn faculty from across Harvard and the way that it influences policymakers,” Elmendorf said. “So the leadership of that center is very important, and I’m working hard to identify the best person to lead it.”
Elmendorf is also in the process of hiring a successor to former IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, who unexpectedly departed before the start of the fall semester to serve a second stint as president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Setti D. Warren, who joined the IOP in 2021 as executive director under Gearan, served as interim director this fall.
Warren said in a November interview that he is interested in becoming the next director of the IOP.
Elmendorf said he wants “a leader of the IOP who is very comfortable with senior public figures and very comfortable sitting in a dining hall talking with students.”
“For the right person, that combination is just amazing, but there are plenty of people for only one half of that would work,” he added.
Elmendorf said that the Kennedy School is currently conducting a “nationwide search” for the next IOP director.
“We’re at the stage of talking with people about whether they want to be considered officially as candidates,” he said. “When we have a shortlist of candidates there will be some student involvement, there will be some involvement of other people at the Kennedy School.”
“At this point, it’s a matter of trying to figure out who sees themselves in this job and whom we potentially see in the job, and then we’ll have to narrow down from that small group,” Elmendorf added.
