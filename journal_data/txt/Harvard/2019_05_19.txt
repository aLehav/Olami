Sir Elton Hercules Wright was born out of humble beginnings as “Reginald Dwight” and later became one of the best-selling musicians in the world. Director Dexter Fletcher captures part of that journey in “Rocketman,” a biopic on the musician that premiered out of competition at Cannes, exploring Elton’s relationship with his family, his sexuality, and of course, his music. The two-hour film, a fantastical musical production, includes some of Elton’s greatest hits, and every scene shimmers with a sense of showbiz glitz. But beyond mapping out well-known biographical facts of Elton’s life, the film does little to tell more of his story.
Fletcher essentially villainized Elton’s parents, giving them no redeeming qualities. As his mother, Bryce Dallas Howard might as well play a porcelain doll, as her character is both flat and aloof. His detached father (Steven Mackintosh), who leaves the family when Elton is young to start a new one, is even more underdeveloped. Amongst his family, his grandmother (Gemma Jones), “nan,” is the savior and encourages young Elton (Matthew Illesley plays a young Reggie Dwight, and Taron Egerton plays the grown-up Elton) to pursue music. But that relationship gets sidelined quickly when Elton seems to only ever focus on the shortcomings of his parents. The only character with some dimension is his long-time collaborator Bernie (Jamie Bell), but his portrayal in the movie seems unrealistically flawless, making him a lovable but dull character nonetheless.
Elton is repeatedly encouraged throughout the film to “be himself” by other characters, but it’s unclear what those words even mean. His grandma encourages him to express himself in his music while Bernie prods Elton to reconsider his extravagant stagewear and focus the performances more on his music. In other cases, these words might seem to hint at Elton’s sexuality, and the film flirts with Elton’s love affairs but comes short of showing true emotional vulnerability. Elton breaks into tears when his mother tells him he’ll live “a life of being alone forever” and “never be loved properly” upon finding out that he’s homosexual, but besides this moment and the first time he comes out to Bernie — who is as supportive as one can be — Fletcher doesn’t explore Elton’s own reconcilation with his sexuality.
Fletcher sets up moments in which Elton can be vulnerable, then shys away from further examining them, glazing over much of Elton’s long list of struggles (which he iterates at rehab in the beginning of the film): addiction with drugs, alcohol, and shopping, and bulimia. Elton has a nervous fit backstage when he finds out half of the Beach Boys are present for his U.S. debut at The Troubadour in L.A., but he overcomes his nerves almost too quickly and jumps on stage. His complicated romantic relationship with his manager John Reid (Richard Madden) is evidently impassioned, but Fletcher’s portrayal of the deterioration of their relationship through his angry dialogue with Ried is surface-level at best.
“Rocketman” touches on a little bit of everything in Elton’s life, but doesn’t go in depth in any one aspect. Fletcher alludes to Elton’s complicated relationship with music when Egerton tells Bernie in rehab that he’s not sure if he’s ready to play again, but the majority of the movie fails to explore this relationship. His addictions are also a constant battle in the background, but even when Elton overdoses and jumps into his own pool, needing to be pulled out and have his stomach pumped, he emerges quite literally glimmering in a sparkly Dodgers costume and singing “Rocket Man” on stage. Fletcher uses the group therapy session more as a narrative device to go back in time and have Elton tell his story from childhood, bringing viewers up to the moment when he walks into rehab.
Despite these shortcomings, Egerton pulls off a brilliant performance as Elton. He exuberates the same charm that Elton channeled for his millions of fans. When he soars off the piano when he plays for the first time in The Troubadour, Egerton lifts the viewer’s spirits as much as he lifts his body. Above all, “Rocketman” is redeemed by the entertainment from the catchy music, jazzy choreography, and glitzy sets. Though the supporting characters are given toneless voices through much of Elton’s childhood, the strategic setting and dancing through high-energy beats like “The Bitch is Back” and “Saturday Nights Alright (For Fighting)” move the film along pleasantly. Elton John’s music itself is a treat, and Matthew Margeson’s reimagination and curation of Elton’s songs throughout the film is on point. In this way, “Rocketman” joins last year’s “Bohemain Rhapsody” in proving again that the success of biopic films depend heavily on the subjects of the films themselves, and the popularity and allure of the work produced by those subjects.

Premiering as a Competition film at Cannes, Mati Diop’s “Atlantique” (“The Atlantics”) is an intricate compilation that weaves love, unheard voices, and fantastical creation together. Set in Senegal, the film focuses on a uniquely female angle of migration: the perspective of those who  are left behind by the men that set out to find a better life elsewhere.
A glistening spiral tower rises amidst scaffolding in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Tensions fly high as the workers at the construction site work drudge through over three months of unpaid labor from Mr. Di’Naye (Diankou Sembene), who owns the project. Souleiman (Ibrahima Traore), who is especially disturbed by the state of affairs, decides to cross the sea towards Spain with a group of equally dissatisfied co-workers in pursuit of better work and opportunity. But he can’t bring himself to notify his secret love, Ada (Mama Bineta Sane), who is set to marry an older and wealthier man, Omar (Babacar Sylla), the next week.
When she realizes he’s gone, she becomes reclusive. Diop emphasizes the external forces that constrain Ada’s agency to find her own happiness. Her family — who is not able to understand her heartbreak due to the secrecy of their love — is less than sympathetic, complying with the traditional standards that her community has set for her. As Ada sulks about her upcoming marriage, her mother reminds her of how many girls around her would love to be in her situation: “Hold on to that place. Time’s are tough.” Even her pragmatic friend Dior (Nicole Sougou), who owns the local bar that serves as a favorite secret meeting location for her and Soleiman, advises her to marry Omar for her own good. “Out there is one big struggle,” Dior laments.
Indeed, times are tough in the city, which also explains why Soleiman and his crew set off in the first place. Ada’s friends are also quick to reveal their envy. “You hit the jackpot here,” one chimes in, gawking at her massive new Victorian-era bed in an extravagantly adorned bedroom on the night of her wedding. Not long after, however, the mattress mysteriously catches on fire, with Ada’s friends claiming that they saw Soleiman right before the incident. This is where the haunting begins. Without turning into a horror film, Diop employs fantastical devices to revive the lost men at sea, who possess the bodies of women they left behind at night. The spiritual possessions indicate how the women will literally complete the failed mission of those that are gone.
This may be Diop’s first feature film, but she’s no newcomer in the industry. “The Atlantics” is loosely based on her 2009 documentary short of the same name, and she’s made several other documentaries in the years since, and first made her film debut as an actress in Claire Denis’ 2008 “35 Shots of Rum.” In the 2014-2015 school year, she was a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study, where her fellowship project was working on the script of “Fire, Next Time,” the seeds of what would eventually become “The Atlantics.”
Most of Diop’s cast are newcomers to the screen who she recruited locally in Senegal, and their inexperience is barely noticeable under her direction. Sane’s breakthrough performance in the film is extraordinary. Her unflinching gaze is capable of expressing fervor in tense moments and hiding all emotion in others. Hazy shots capture every setting: Heat waves, dirt, darkness, ocean mist. Claire Mathon’s cinematography is tastefully hazy and heightens the sense eeriness that pervades the environment at night, and Fatima Al Qadri’s dramatic score complements the ghostly occurrences throughout the film. The ultimate meaning of the film comes out just as hazy as the cinematography, leaving some other elements of the film unanswered: What happens when the men get what they came back for? Will the ghosts continue to live through the women’s bodies at night? Nonetheless, Diop takes a distinctive view on migration and tells a mesmerizing story that is breathtaking up to the very last shot.

Although the making of the Battle of Winterfell in “The Long Night” was anticipated to be the most epic episode in the days leading up to its premiere — with constant references to the nearly 11 weeks of nighttime shoots — the battle at King’s Landing in the most recent episode far surpassed it. Where The Battle at Winterfell was extremely dark and far too dependent on action scenes of extras, the fight at King’s Landing was expertly filmed and written. Although no episode is perfect, this one was close: Finally, fans get the episode they deserve.
After the death of Missandei in the previous episode, most fans expected Daeny to snap, and snap she did. In the fashion of her father, the Mad King, she decides to burn them all — civilians included — despite the fact that the city has surrendered. However, in the seconds before Daeny makes the decision to attack the innocent people of King’s Landing, the camera expertly cuts to Tyrion as he looks between the bells that signal surrender and Daeny poised on her dragon ready to strike. Tension rises as the audience, along with Tyrion, hopes the bells ring before Daeny can move. When they do, a collective breath is released, until fans see Daeny’s face as she stares at the Red Keep, the palace her family built all those centuries ago. Even though most speculated that Daeny would turn to unnecessary violence, the moment she takes off with Drogon to burn the city is breathtaking and shocking.
The episode also edits scenes in a way that gives poetic justice to Arya and the Hound’s strange relationship. The two push their way against frantic civilians to the Red Keep in the hopes of revenge. However, in a touching scene, the Hound tells Arya, “You come with me, you die here,” to which Arya responds, “Sandor. Thank you.” This simple dialogue speaks volumes as these two gruff characters acknowledge their relationship for the last time. As the Hound fights his brother, the scenes seamlessly transition between the brawl and Arya’s travels through the streets to safety. When the Hound is thrown against a wall by the Mountain, the camera cuts to Arya thrown against the wall by the crowd. Not only do fans finally get the CleganeBowl they have wanted for years; they get it expertly woven into the episode forever connecting the two unlikely companions: Arya and the Hound.
But not everything can be perfect. Jaime and Cersei finally meet their end in each others arms as the castle falls on top of them. For Jaime, this ending makes sense. For Cersei, however, it doesn’t. There is something to be said for Jaime’s character arc: Even after he seems to have reformed, forgotten Cersei, and become a better man, he realizes that he will always do the wrong thing if that’s what Cersei wants. The presentation of a clear path to redemption that is ultimately not taken is very much in line with the style of “Game of Thrones.” While fans’ hearts break for Brienne, there is something so honest about Jaime’s arc. While Jaime’s death feels right — after all, he told Bronn in Season Five that he hoped “to die in the arms of the woman I love” — Cersei gets off far too easy. As a tyrant and major antagonist, Cersei’s death in the arms of her brother as she softly weeps seems far too simple. After all the brutal murders fans have witnessed, many at the request of Cersei herself, watching her hold Jaime as rubble falls around her is fairly anti-climatic. Part of this may be because there is no direct murderer, no one character that wielded the sword or poured the poison. Cersei is killed because she stayed too long in her tower and couldn’t manage to escape her own castle. As one of the most evil and complex villains on TV, she deserved far more.
At the beginning of “The Bells,” Varys turned to Tyrion moments before his execution to say, “Goodbye old friend.” Next week as fans sit down to watch the final episode of “Game of Thrones,” they will say the same.
